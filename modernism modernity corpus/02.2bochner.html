<p>
Upon the publication of C&eacute;line's first novel,
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit, </I>Cendrars wrote to his
friend Jacques-Henri L&eacute;vesque:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . I am really surprised that in this flood of articles
no one remembers <I>Moravagine, </I>which, already ten years
ago, contained <I>all the themes </I>of <I>Voyage au bout de
la nuit </I>which today cause so much ink to flow: war,
flight, America, life among the savages, madness, eroticism,
suburbia, doctors, etc.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
One can understand Cendrars's disappointment about both the
reception of <I>Moravagine </I>and the ignored parallels
with C&eacute;line's novel. First, the climate of reception
had changed. When the three editors of
<I>Litt&eacute;rature, </I>Breton, Soupault, and Aragon, had
published extracts from the still unpublished novel in 1919,
<I>Moravagine </I>had plainly influenced the three young
writers still in search of what was to become Surrealism;
but by the time the novel was published in 1926, its
shock-effect had diminished. Moreover, despite its violence,
eroticism, nihilism, madness, rebellion, and adventure,
<I>Moravagine </I>could not be perceived as a popular novel,
unlike C&eacute;line's novel with the colloquial language
rhythms that were its greatest literary innovation. Cendrars
had remained in the avant-garde tradition, now writing
poetic prose as powerful and unexpected as his proselike
poetry from before the war. Second, Cendrars had good reason
to be surprised about the ignored parallels with
C&eacute;line's novel: the similarities between

<B></B>

 <I>Moravagine </I>and <I>Voyage au bout
de la nuit </I>are
flagrant, and I do not know why no one has chosen to explore
them. Both novels have doctor-narrators, C&eacute;line's
Bardamu and Cendrars's Raymond, and both doctors have
complex, obsessional relationships with mad doubles--Bardamu
with Robinson, who lives like an outlaw and precedes Bardamu
in all his escapades, whether to the front, Africa, or
America, and whose death from morphine injections ends the
novel; and Raymond with Moravagine, whom he frees to lead an
outlaw life, who drags Raymond across Germany, Russia, North
and South America, and who haunts Raymond's imagination at
the front. Like Robinson, Moravagine dies from morphine at
the end. Even the name Moravagine finds its counterpart in
C&eacute;line's Doctor Parapine (playing, I suppose,
hoist-the-male-member to Cendrars's death-to-the-vagina).
Parapine lies in wait for little girls outside schools and
ends up in an asylum; Cendrars begins with Moravagine in an
asylum, and after Raymond helps him to escape he immediately
begins killing little girls.

<p>
My purpose here, however, is not to make a full-scale
comparison, but to highlight the absence of what we would
surely expect to be a major concern in both novels--the
world war in which both authors fought. This war, though
vital to the narratives, is almost absent from the writing,
as if the two fictional narrator-doctors purposely refuse to
grant it the importance it clamors for. Perhaps they are
effecting a cure, as it were, of war. C&eacute;line allots
about sixty pages to the war--scenes with no combat or
death--in order to open a novel of five hundred pages;
Cendrars reduces World War I to three pages in three hundred
and sixty. And yet Cendrars, in his letter to
L&eacute;vesque, mentions the war as the first in the list
of common themes, an indication of his awareness that the
war is the real subject of both works. My proposed topic is
this enormous presence in the form of near-absence, this
gap, possibly a memory gap, in <I>Moravagine. </I>I will
examine this void in <I>Moravagine </I>before returning, at
the end, to C&eacute;line for comparison.

<p>
It is well known that there are lacunae or memory gaps in
<I>Moravagine. </I>Nearly twenty years ago, Stephen
Bellstrom analyzed the day that Raymond completely forgets
during the assassination attempt in Russia.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Later, Raymond loses consciousness for several weeks while
he and Moravagine flee the Jivaro Indians. As a general
rule, Raymond, who is the narrator of an adventure book,
never actually experiences any adventure. Even when he
participates, as he does in the plot to blow up the
polytechnic school in Moscow, he is so absent from the event
he cannot be sure it has occurred. Mich&egrave;le Touret has
described Raymond as a fictional narrator who is no longer
able to narrate. She demonstrates that it is not only
Raymond but the entire narrative authority that collapses as
a result of these lapses in consciousness.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The
very story stumbles along with him, just as he seems to flee
it. Raymond never witnesses violence, and he never sees
Moravagine killing or tearing open a woman; yet this is the
primary symbolic act of the novel, one that is announced in
the very title and name of the hero. Raymond's complete
absence from what appears essential to the narrative might
give rise to a reading of schizophrenia. Such a reading
would find a Raymond-la-Science playing a Dr. Jekyll who
hides from himself his evil incarnation 

<B></B>

as Mr. Hyde. And he
would be perfectly justified in concealing Hyde from Jekyll,
who would not survive the revelation of the horror at the
heart of his being. This horror will be placed ouside, in
<I>Moravagine. </I>Raymond demands to be heard, even if he
has not actually seen the horrors he tells. By presenting
himself as the narrator, he constructs himself as a witness.
<I>Moravagine </I>remains the story, told by Raymond, of all
the possible sorts of violence--that is, all the violence
that the doctor Raymond can imagine--with the notable
exception of the violence of war. War then, is, the ultimate
violence, engulfing everything at once, and while it appears
to be the logical outcome of Moravagine's activities, it
brings the novel and its narrator to a sudden halt. The
narrative rushes through the war in a three-page chapter,
hastening to more congenial ground in a concluding prison
scene. It is not only Raymond who loses control, as he
always does with the women's murders; it is as if language
itself were also forced to falter. Thus Robert Llambias has
written about C&eacute;line: "the writing manifests its own
failure at the very moment of description. Is the war, then,
not first of all the sickness of language?"
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But here is the first major difference I would like to draw
between C&eacute;line and Cendrars: the war inaugurates
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit, </I>but the author manages to
rediscover his language in its wake; we may even say that
language is victorious over war in C&eacute;line's work. In
<I>Moravagine, </I>on the other hand, the three pages of war
end the adventures of the hero, who is left with one
incomprehensible word, a word that means everything but is
in Martian. Here, then, are two very different responses to
the illness that war instills in language.

<p>
While the war is a lacuna in the narrative that neither
Raymond nor Moravagine can fill, both characters live in a
world full of violence that they willingly provoke. What is
the nature of their violent acts that are so incompatible
with the ultimate violence of war?

<p>
For a start, one could say Moravagine is an anarchist. This,
in fact, is the role he plays in Russia. Here the novel is
full of politics, social revolution, terrorism, and all
sorts of anarchist activism about which the novelist knew
little, if we are to believe Emile Szittya, Cendrars's
prewar friend and fellow editor of <I>Les Hommes nouveaux;
</I>for Szittya, Cendrars was an "idealistic, strictly
philosophical" anarchist.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Act and philosophy
coexist together in <I>Moravagine </I>when, for example, the
terrorists claim allegiance to Prince Kropotkine, who is
obliged to disinherit them because they massacre their own
companions. Moravagine's violence against his own fellows is
the ultimate anarchism, because it sows the seeds of
anarchism in anarchism itself. Cendrars's anarchism, which I
will call cultural, suggests that we pay particular
attention to the anarchist temptation, that is, the
temptation of the intellectual doctor Raymond. In
Moravagine, anarchism is pure and absolute; in Raymond, it
is problematized.

<p>
Though Cendrars was never, as far as we know, an active
political anarchist, he was certainly raised on anarchist
fare and circulated among anarchists prior to World War I.
The name of Kropotkine does not appear in <I>Moravagine
</I>out of nowhere; Cendrars was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds,
a small town in Switzerland which was 

<B></B>

one of the most
important centers of the watchmaking industry, (Le Corbusier
was born there in the same year, and began his working life
designing fob-watch covers.) It was from this town that
Kropotkine organized his anarchist activities in Europe, for
example editing the Jura Federation's newsletter, <I>Le
R&eacute;volt&eacute;. </I>While the Prince was active in
the Jura only before Cendrars's birth, the area had a long
tradition of anarchist sympathies which had certainly not
weakened during Cendrars's youth. Cendrars also became an
avid reader of Elis&eacute;e Reclus's famous <I>Geographie
universelle, </I>and while we might think his interest to
have been primarily in travel to exotic places, his
adventurous poetry and fiction betray the populist attitudes
of both Reclus and Kropotkine.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
After living in Saint Petersburg during the 1905 uprisings
and again in 1911, Cendrars followed his girlfriend,
F&eacute;la Poznanska, to New York. F&eacute;la taught for a
while at the Ferrer School, founded by Emma Goldman and
other anarchists and named in honor of Francesco Ferrer, a
Spanish educator and anarchist executed in Spain in 1910.
Cendrars most certainly attended evening lectures and
discussions at this "modern" school, directed at the time by
a very young Will Durant (Ariel was a student, and her
fanciful name was typical for this particular student body).

<p>
Around June 1912, Cendrars returned to Paris with a lecture
on "Beaut&eacute; et anarchisme" ("Beauty and Anarchism"),
which he would read to the <I>Club lib&eacute;ral de
discussion </I>in September. In the meantime, he again
linked up with Szittya to transform the latter's more
political <I>Neue Menschen </I>(Paris, 1910; Munich, 1911)
into <I>Les Hommes Nouveaux, </I>where "Anarchismus und
Sch&ouml;nheit" ("Anarchism and Beauty"), by "Jack Lee,"
appeared in October, along with the first article ever
published on the French anarchist Andr&eacute; Suar&egrave;s
(Cendrars later said that he had written this, but it is
signed by another editor, Marius Hanot). The editors
frequented a caf&eacute; on the rue Cujas, where, as Szittya
had it, all the anarchists running from the police would
loiter before they were arrested. The same caf&eacute;
appears in <I>Moravagine, </I>full of Russian
spies.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
From 1911-1913, Parisian newspapers were full of headlines
about the Bonnot gang. (When Bonnot was finally trapped in a
barn and killed, he received more press coverage than the
sinking of the <I>Titanic </I>the previous week). This
loosely organized group, consisting mainly of bandits with
anarchist ties, robbed banks and made their getaways in
cars. Though Cendrars did not know Bonnot, he did know
people associated with him--Victor Kibaltchich, for example,
who was editing the journal <I>L'Anarchie. </I>Arrested for
complicity in the gang's activities, Kibaltchich served five
years in prison and then was exiled from France. He adopted
the pseudonym Victor Serge and participated in the
anarchist-syndicalist uprisings in Barcelona. These events
provide the backdrop, if not the model, for the framework of
<I>Moravagine</I>--the narrator "R . . . " awaits execution
in a Spanish prison in 1924. A few years later, Serge
translated Cendrars's <I>L'Or </I>into
Russian.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
(Eisenstein tried to film the novel
when he went to Hollywood.) The narrator "R . . . ",
however, is also saddled with another identity from the
ranks of the Bonnot gang, Raymond Callemin, nicknamed
Raymond-la-Science for his cool demeanor. In a radio
interview 

<B></B>

 from the 1950's, Cendrars
claimed to have known
Callemin; in the preface to <I>Moravagine, </I>he writes,
"If we admit that R. exists . . . then we have to assume he
is Raymond-la-Science" (<I>M,</I> 239).
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
The
novel, however, is not only a neat <I>roman &agrave; clef,
</I>but also a game of false identities and obvious masks;
Raymond-la-Science had been executed in 1913, a dozen years
before Cendrars executes him "novelistically" in Spain in
1924, and there is no doubt that Cendrars would have
expected his readers to remember the Bonnot gang trials.

<p>
Zamuel Blazek, whom Szittya mentions, presents another
anarchist trail we might follow into <I>Moravagine.
</I>Szittya reports that Blazek was the author of a short
story in which a man committed revolutionary acts as a
result of sexual perversity, and, as Bellstrom has shown,
Cendrars drew so heavily on Blazek's short story, even using
Blazek's character Mascha without changing her name, that it
was certainly a case of plagiarism.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
In the
recently published correspondence quoted at the beginning of
this essay, Cendrars reveals that two other characters in
<I>Moravagine, </I>A.A.A. and Z.Z.Z., are based on
anarchists he met, Z.Z.Z. standing for Zamuel Blazek
(<I>JEM, </I>482). Their words in the novel are the words of
the real men, as remembered by Cendrars; this would mean
Cendrars placed Blazek inside Blazek's own fiction!

<p>
Anarchistically, <I>Moravagine </I>is an array of slippery
identities and unattributable subversions. It is a novel
fraught with anarchist influences and representations, some
flagrant, others more subtle. The history of anarchism and
the stories of obscure anarchists sustain a worldview hungry
for political and social freedom, and that hunger functions
like a vacuum that only the mythical Moravagine can fill
absolutely.

<p>
Moravagine seeks to be completely free. He dreams like Dada,
but Dada before Dadaism, before freedom had a
program.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
In this respect, he is
extraordinarily seductive, and he takes control of any
undertaking that he joins. But he never carries through;
before accomplishing anything, he has to disappear or flee,
because any success would abolish his perpetual anarchism.
This ideal or idealistic anarchism is not monistic; it has
its counterpart in the irrational, in a violence that
opposes all order or completeness. In the end, Raymond the
alienated scientist is seduced by the violence of
Moravagine, the great human beast with an unleashed ability
to put suppressed desire into action.

<p>
Before the world goes to war, Moravagine makes war against
the world. He always seeks the origin in order to destroy
it, which is impossible and, therefore, desirable. He
searches for the primordial rhythm in Berlin and nihilism in
Moscow; he seeks the first human civilization on the shores
of the Oronoco river, where he preaches matriarchy to the
Indians and then escapes down the Amazon, "the most ancient
river of the globe, in this valley that is the matrix of the
world. . . . " (<I>M,</I> 382).
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
He destroys
neither Berlin nor Saint Petersburg nor Amazonia, but only
the women who live there. He cannot go any further in his
anarchist--that is, individual and symbolic--destruction
than by tearing open women, one by one. Moravagine assumes
the right to commit these murders all the more freely on the
grounds that he was born fatherless and his mother died in
childbirth. This emotional inadequacy of an imprisoned
individual translates itself into universal privation only
when Raymond the doctor 

<B></B>

 releases him
from the asylum.
Raymond considers himself a healer not of illness but of the
world's artificial health; he wants to change the world
radically, to destroy its oppressive, bourgeois meliorism.
Moravagine does not actually desire what he performs, but
plays the role of desire itself; he is action without a
consciousness, enacting whatever Raymond wishes or is afraid
of wishing. After the death of Rita, especially after the
extinction of her gaze, for him a source of life, Moravagine
has lost all interest in life; he has become a Narcissus
without a mirror. In his prison, he has been emptied of any
desire and has become a void that awaits Raymond's projected
desires. Moravagine is "cold, self-controlled, without
illusion, blas&eacute;," and he takes over every action,
"indifferent like a God, indifferent like an idiot" (<I>M,
</I>310).
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
He is so aware of the danger he
represents that he himself warns:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I am not of your race. I am from the Mongol clan that
revealed a monstrous truth--the truth of life, the knowledge
of rhythm--and that will always ravage your stagnant homes.
. . . My stallion is wilder than your cogwheel; my hoofs of
horn are more dangerous than your iron wheels. Surround me
with your hundred thousand bayonets of western light,
because woe to you if I emerge from my dark cave to chase
your trail. . . . Tremble if I emerge from your walls as
from Attila's tent, masked, terrifyingly overgrown, cloaked
only in my hood, like my companions in the convict prison at
the hour of their death walk, and if with my strangling
hands, my hands reddened by the cold, I rip open the frail
stomach of your civilization! [<I>M, </I>279]
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
If it is clear that Moravagine is not human, it is equally
clear that he is not simply an allegory. He is at least
doubly anarchic: he is the dream of freedom in excess, of
the continuous re-creation of the self, and, at the same
time, the dream of fascist power, the power to enact one's
violence with impunity. He is the double dream of Raymond
who has never "known" women, but who simultaneously wants to
free himself from them and punish them. The Raymond who
desires (and who, more precisely, desires to transcribe his
narrative of desire) writes Moravagine the Mongol into the
world as a double--the "it" or psychoanalytic id, and the
"libertine" Mongol. Cendrars chooses the term "libertine" to
indicate "him who lives in freedom of thought and,
especially, feeling."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Both are seductive: the
libertine, because we desire to enjoy all kinds of liberty;
the id, because it dares to defy all that is forbidden. It
remains up to Raymond to justify this coupling, and to
explain, for example, how a woman's masochism instigates a
free man's violence.

<p>
Masochism, we learn from Raymond's argument, extends from
women to Jews, to the revolution that is Jewish, to
civilization, to the whole world, and finally to the
principle of origin itself, which brings us back to the
woman. The love that creates all is also the desire for
death and effacement of the self. With this conclusion,
Raymond is not far from Freud's cultural criticism in
<I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle, </I>published in 1920. But
Raymond tinges his analysis with a total masochism that has
nothing to impart other than raging hatred. What is
important in the novel is not so much the masochism of
women, but the profound disgust that the feminine provokes
in Raymond, precisely because woman is in charge of love and
all creation, and she 

<B></B>

 remains
triumphant over male attempts
to control her or free himself of her (<I>M,
</I>291-94).
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Controlling her would be
patriarchy; freeing himself of her would be anarchy. Raymond
chooses anarchy when he follows Moravagine. In any case,
this choice is also a dead end, for it acknowledges the
superiority of the opponent. From here stems the fundamental
violence in Moravagine's anarchy; the violence emerges from
Raymond's despair to find a freedom for men without women, a
homeland, or any bonds whatsoever. The violence that is
impotent and suppressed in Raymond finds free rein in
Moravagine; for his Doctor Caligari, the Mongol effects a
double cure for the lack of liberty and the lack of power.
It is only at the very end of the story, which is placed as
a frame at the beginning of the narrative, and only after
the death of Moravagine, that Raymond acts for himself and
becomes an anarchist and a regicide in his own name.

<p>
But before Raymond frees the Moravagine in himself, there is
a whole novel about the unleashing of a being's anarchic
forces by the skewed sciences of modernity. In the
foreground is psychiatry, which Raymond seeks to indict when
he arrives at Waldensee in 1900. (One wonders if Cendrars
knew that Jung had left Basel in the same year with the
intention of making the very same indictment at a
psychiatric hospital in Zurich.) The novel begins with this
double-edged character, a Raymond who is "impatient to free
himself from the Institution" (<I>M,</I> 243), but also an
ironic Raymond, the narrator who has already been revealed
to the reader as a future regicide.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Raymond
says that psychiatry, once the keeper of mental health, is
now surpassed by psychoanalysis, the new "pataphysics" of
Freud, which is first put into practice at Dr. Stein's.
Raymond seeks to shock the psychiatrists by rejecting their
prejudices about normal health, "a normal, absolute, fixed
state," and he vows to become even more scientific and view
illness "objectively, amorally, intellectually" (<I>M,</I>
242).
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Quickly seduced by Moravagine's powerful
madness, Raymond offers criticisms that already reveal his
youthful fantasy of making his mark. Nevertheless, his
initiative against psychiatry as the keeper of health
remains likeable. Actually, Cendrars is not alone among
writers of this period to offer us an individual hero
suffering at the hands of a psychiatry that epitomizes
modern science operating in the service of outdated regimes.
Examples are Thomas Mann's <I>The Magic Mountain </I>
and Robert Wiene's <I>Cabinet de Dr. Caligari </I>, a
film that Cendrars reviewed for <I>Feuilles
libres.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
T. S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land
</I>also draws its source from the same rejection of
authority disguised as spiritual healing; Eliot actually
wrote part five of his manuscript at Dr. Vittoz's "rest
home" in Lausanne. Cendrars, we should recall, defended the
renegade psychoanalyst Otto Gross when the latter's father,
a well-known criminologist, placed him in an insane asylum.
"[This is] the shameful behavior of a narrow-minded father
(all our fathers are narrow-minded) . . ." Cendrars wrote in
<I>Revolution, </I>a German avant-garde
journal.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Compared to the hypocritical use of a
whole army of shiny machinery to impose order in Stein's
sanatorium--"They have silver rectums and vulvae in chromed
leather. . . . They pronounce themselves spiritual directors
of the spinal cord and coldly practice the laparotomy of
consciences" (<I>M,</I> 246)--Raymond's decision to free

<B></B>

 an
"incurable" patient seems simple humanitarian
compassion.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
We may doubt his intentions, but
we are seduced by the attempt. Jung also linked himself with
a presumably incurable patient; he helped Otto Gross escape.
This helps to put Gross, guru to the von Richthofen sisters
(Frieda married D. H. Lawrence, Elsa had a long affair with
the famous sociologist, Max Weber), at the top of the list
of models for Moravagine.

<p>
There is an attitude in the novel toward machinery which
seems contradictory and is worth examining before finally
addressing the lacuna of war. In his early youth, Moravagine
had associated machinery with freedom: "all the mechanical
noises of motors, all the activities of the machine have
been linked since then with vast images of light, sky,
space, grandeur, liberty . . . " (<I>M,
</I>259).
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
As a result, once the "sinister old
man of Vienna" ("sinistre vieillard de Vienne," [<I>M,
</I>261-62]) has deprived him of Rita, Moravagine transfers
his eroticism to machines and manufactured objects: "The
sewing machine was like the outline, the cross-section of a
courtesan, a mechanic demonstration of the music-hall
dancer's power" (<I>M, </I>266).
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Later, in
prison in Presburg, he is forced to annul his own senses and
must disappear into his imagination. It is then that he
becomes the Mongol, "wilder than your cogwheel" and "more
dangerous than your iron wheels." The machines, in that
first context of love, are the purveyors of freedom, loving
and flying, but in the context of imprisonment, they are
agents of repression. For Cendrars, modern machinery is not
an unequivocal good, and we should read more carefully the
passage in the novel which is always interpreted as
Cendrars's own proclamation on the principle of utility. In
the chapter, "Nos radonn&eacute;es en Am&eacute;rique,"
Cendrars does not eulogize the machine, but praises its
function as an extension of the creative hand of man who
molds, unconsciously and in apparent disorder, the world
around him, which thereby emerges as his representation. The
anarchy of individualist capitalism is analogous to the
first stirrings of the imagination in prehistory when
"primitive man . . . put a handle on his stone axe"
(<I>M,</I> 345).

But one should not be duped by
this machine which, once detached from the worker's hand, no
longer represents him (or man in general). It is in this
context that one should read the poignant text Moravagine
writes by hand, a prose-poem presenting the Mongol's last
coherent words:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Young man, consider the dryness of this facetious tragedy.
Don't forget, there is never progress when the heart is
petrified. All science should be ordered like a fruit; it
should hang from a tree of flesh and ripen by the sun of
passion, hystiology, photography, electric bells,
telescopes, scissors, amperes, irons, etc.--that's all
razzle-dazzle for the crowd.

<p>
After all the anarchic violence against politics,
civilization, and healing, against anarchy itself, and even
against the matrix of all these--women--the novel suddenly
changes tone when it encounters the "magnificent people of
Levallois-Perret and Courbevoie, blue-collar workers,
mechanics who work on cars and airplanes" 

<B></B>

 (<I>M,
</I>385).
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Now the fine optimism of the machine
takes charge of the narrative. As if healed, Moravagine
lives out his childhood dream of flying in the air to the
sound of a motor. The engineer who designs the propellor is
called Blaise Cendrars; this is a sure sign of how well
things are going. Raymond is exiled to a sanctuary of sorts
between the two towers of Chartres cathedral, where he
resumes the drudgery of scholarship, since he has lost his
"great wild beast" and can no longer live. Without Raymond,
Moravagine can enter into his beautiful machine to realize
his dream of freedom. But something more powerful
intervenes--it is the war with its "thousand bayonets," and
Moravagine is forced to disappear.

<p>
In the short chapter that follows, entitled "la guerre"
("the war"), Moravagine's status changes entirely; he now
exists only in Raymond's dreams. Since the machinery has
passed into the hands of the old men of the state, Raymond
becomes merely "cannon fodder" ("chair &agrave; canon,"
[<I>M,</I> 395]) without his friend. He dreams of even
greater destruction--if only "Moravagine had had access to
these weapons, funds, factories, gas, and guns" (<I>M,</I>
396).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
But it is clear that Moravagine is no
longer there, that he has been textually surpassed by the
enormity of the war that requires so few words to make its
impact felt. On the one hand, he is reduced to committing
what Raymond calls a banality--an attempted personal assault
on the emperor Franz-Joseph. On the other hand, Moravagine
haunts Raymond's imagination; he becomes Raymond's "guardian
angel" and teaches him "apache tricks" to outwit the enemy.
The war is transposed into a child's game, as in Cendrars's
superb poem <I>Guerre au Luxembourg, </I>in which the game
permits warring without being present at the battlefield.
This chapter is also noteworthy because it resembles, and is
in fact almost a mirror image of, Cendrars's personal
experience in the war as he relates it in the "Pro-Domo," a
thirty-page description of how he wrote the novel (the
"Pro-Domo" was appended to the novel itself). At this moment
in the novel, Raymond becomes Cendrars--both are saved by
the same "apache," Moravagine, cast as a good Samaritan who
picks up the wounded at the farmhouse in Champagne
(<I>M,</I> 395).
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
By spreading atrocities and assuming a patriotic hypocrisy
about the seeds of horror that it sows, war reduces the
anarchist act to insignificance. Civilization claims for
itself the violence of the Mongol whom it has suppressed or
sublimated. A mutilated Raymond says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I felt in my very gut the shame of being human and of having
collaborated. . . . The War. Philosophies, religions, the
arts, techniques, professions--all result in this. The
finest flowers of civilization. . . . What is shameful is to
kill in gangs at a certain time, on a given day, in honor of
certain principles, in the name of a flag, under the
surveillance of old men. . . . [<I>M,</I>
402-3]
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
So the war is the battle of old men and patriarchs such as
Franz-Joseph, who haunts Moravagine's youth and motivates
his last act. Moravagine flies solo from Paris to Berlin to
drop a bomb on the tyrant's palace; but his protest in the
name of liberty has no effect on the determination of the
State or on the insistence of entire civilizations that we
rush to war. His solitary act, once the symptom of an
internal disorder 

<B></B>

 that was constantly
repressed, loses its
raison d'&ecirc;tre in the presence of war. The State,
established in the name of a mythology called Justice for
the express purpose of resolving arguments between the haves
and the have-nots, now rallies everyone to go after the
other, some foreigner; this other, whom we do not need to
know, will become the only have-not. Enlightened by the war
and the loss of his leg, Raymond realizes that Moravagine
will always be this stranger, and yet also his brother. The
anarchist Moravagine cannot even conceive of property since
property is the first theft, this is why he undermines the
State while foreseeing and preparing the war that will
eliminate him.

<p>
Not only political anarchism disappears in the abyss of war;
Moravagine's violence <I>against </I>women, which is his
violence against civilization and its origin, against all
that is feminine, is also eliminated and replaced by a
violence <I>for </I>women. The war is the battle of old men
fought by thousands of young, armed men. The old men seek to
reaffirm their origin and repossess their heritage; they
want to invade the city and possess the women. Anticipating
a war, D'Annunzio had set out the old metaphor clearly
enough: "Ah, I would have possessed you in the middle of the
massacre, on a bed of fire, under the wing of death. . . .
My will would have made my body perform miracles. . . . I
would have taken you."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
With less lucidity than
D'Annunzio, who simultaneously plays the role of the old and
the young man, the soldiers kill one another to win, without
really knowing what is to be won, only the old men know what
they want. Moravagine had tried to eliminate the stakes of
the game. Actually, as long as the story permits him to kill
women, the war cannot take place. Moravagine draws his
strength by postponing the war as the object of narration,
but his violence cannot eradicate the desire to possess. The
desire to appropriate the feminine lights up a global
conflict and snuffs out Moravagine, the anarchist become
idiot.

<p>
The war is a memory gap for the anarchist narration. But the
gap is not empty; it is the scene for a transfer of the
remains of anarchist power. When he is wounded during the
war Raymond awakens to his own madness and crosses over to
Moravagine's side. Through the loss of his leg, he is able
to forge a fraternal link with this stranger whose
monstrousness has been displaced. Raymond takes Moravagine's
place by becoming a regicide or an anarchist with the same
calmness and indifference as Moravagine. Before the war,
Raymond is only an observer; after it, he becomes active. In
1920, Cendrars had written of the war as a hiatus:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

psychosis of a

&nbsp;&nbsp;generation at its end. . .
<BR>

Clean break. New express departure on a steel rail.

Mallarm&eacute;,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intellectual bolshevism, insanity.
<BR>
And then the war: emptiness.
<BR>
And then came a new time: construction, simultaneity,
affirmation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Calicot: Rimbaud: change in ownership. Posters.
The
fa&ccedil;ades of houses 

<B></B>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;plastered with headlines. The street cluttered
with words.
Modern
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;machinery that man can do without. Bolshevism in
action. A
world.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This emptiness, in which murders rage and massacre is
systematic, marks the transition from intellectual
Bolshevism to activist Bolshevism, or, in other words, the
transformation of Raymond into Moravagine. For Cendrars,
this would seem a promising transformation, and yet the war
remains inexpressible, or rather, unworthy of the language
of freedom. One might be tempted to say the same for
C&eacute;line. But whereas <I>Moravagine </I>takes place
primarily before the war, preparing it only to be suffocated
by it, <I>Voyage au bout de la nuit </I>unfolds after the
war and deploys a vengeful language to affirm the Mongol's
sorrowful victory. As Bardamu says, around a hundred pages
before the end of the novel: "In thinking now about all the
insane people whom I met at Baryton's, I cannot help but
believe that there are true realizations of our profound
temperaments other than war and death, the two infinite
nightmares."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The war is a revolution in insanity for Cendrars, but it is
a confirmation for C&eacute;line. Cendrars embraces
modernity, whereas C&eacute;line sinks into disgust and ends
his novel with the words "let us speak about it no more"
("qu'on en parle plus") to signal a distress about the
narratibility of his story. For C&eacute;line, we know this
distress will only encourage more writing. Cendrars, by
constrast, enters many periods of silence as a writer,
starting with his silence about the war and the empty sleeve
he carried as its consequence. The silence of the hiatus is
far from empty--it displays full consciousness of the pain
that cannot be expressed. During the other great silence
that started for him in 1941, Cendrars wrote in a letter
that Hitler seemed to emerge directly from the character of
Moravagine (<I>JEM,</I> 143). Hitler, of course, incarnates
the inexpressible war, but as the double of the frightful
Mongol. Four years later, while he was waiting for the
proofs of <I>L'Homme foudroy&eacute;, </I>Cendrars bestowed
an eloquent wish upon his Mongol turned F&uuml;hrer; he
wrote: "I was happy about Mussolini's hanging. Who cares
about the other one? We should never write his name again"
(<I>JEM, </I>333).

Il y a &agrave; l'&eacute;poque: tango, ballets Russes,
cubisme, Mallarm&eacute;, bolch&eacute;visme

"Lettre en guise de postface" to (Jean Epstein, <I>La
Po&eacute;sie d'aujourd'hui; un nouvel &eacute;tat
d'intelligence </I>[Paris: La Sir&egrave;ne, 1921]). I am
keeping the original version of La Sir&egrave;ne, "the
modern machine which man can do without," which is
compatible with my analysis of machines in Cendrars. Claude
Leroy argues for changing this to "modern machines which man
cannot do without" ("In&eacute;dits et documents," <I>Revue
des sciences humaines </I>216 [1989]: 181-182).

que j'ai connus chez le p&egrave;re Baryton, je ne peux
m'emp&ecirc;cher de mettre en doute qu'il existe d'autres
v&eacute;ritables r&eacute;alisations de nos profonds
temp&eacute;raments que la guerre et la maladie, les deux
infinis du cauchemar.
