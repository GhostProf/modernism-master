We are two men, two minute sparks of life; outside is the night and
the circle of death. We sit on the edge of it crouching in danger, the
grease drops from our hands, in our hearts we are close to one another
and the hour is like the room: flecked over with the lights and shadows
of our feelings cast by a quiet fire. What does he know of me or I of
him? Formerly we should not have had a single thought in common--now we
sit with a goose between us and feel in unison, are so intimate that we
do not even speak.

There is a peculiar power about rottenness, in that it feeds on itself,
borrows from itself, and its tendency is always downward. That very
action had seized the polluted imagination of the Irishman. He was

<p>
In the classic scene of male bonding from the great novel of World War I,
<i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, Paul Baumer and his comrade, Kat,
prepare a meal and find themselves sharing "a more complete communion
. . . than even lovers have."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  As Jane Marcus asserts, Remarque's enormously influential novel
  (translated into English in 1929) changed the perception "of war
  fictions roughly from epic invocations of individual heroism to
  initiations into brotherhood."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Further, Samuel Hynes declares that

<b></b>

in the late 1920s and early 1930s, "the classic war books were published"
and "the Myth of the War was defined and fixed in the version that still
retains authority."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  At the center of this myth is the idea that the "experience of battle
  was incommunicable" to those outside the "exclusive, quasi-mystical
  fellowship" of men who had seen action.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  Written primarily by gentleman officers and middle-class soldiers,
  the war "classics" describe British soldiers as innocent victims,
  sacrificed by callous old men and especially by the women they were
  supposed to protect. In this familiar narrative the camaraderie between
  soldiers overcomes regional and class divisions, providing solace
  amidst the madness and horror. And while such love often produced
  passionate, homoerotic descriptions, critics have generally followed
  Paul Fussell's lead in perceiving homosexual desire at the front as
  resembling "the 'idealistic,' passionate, but non-physical crushes
  which most officers had experienced at public school."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
A little-known war story by a working-class Irish veteran challenges
the canonical version of what happened between men in World War I.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Privately published in 1930 and out of print for decades before its
  reissue in 1997, James Hanley's "The German Prisoner" undermines
  the idea of British soldiers as innocent victims, showing rather
  how the war machine exploits class divisions, misogyny, homophobia,
  and repressed homosexual desire, inciting soldiers to the vicious
  slaughter of other men. "The German Prisoner" describes in graphic
  detail how O'Garra and Elston, two Tommies lost in "the fog of war,"
  take mutual pleasure from beating, torturing, raping, and murdering an
  enemy who has surrendered to them. The narrative culminates in their
  destruction when a shell blows them into the muck as they grapple
  together in a murderous paroxysm of desire. Despite its disturbing
  resemblance to postwar narratives that glorify an aesthetic of
  violence, Hanley's story exposes and indicts rather than celebrates
  theculture of war through its emphasis on the release of repressed
  desire through atrocity.

<p>
"The German Prisoner" speaks the language of the trenches--the language
of bodies at war--and provides a rare glimpse of killing's emotional
charge. Challenging the myth of the war's indescribability, Fussell
insists that the English language could "perfectly well render the
actuality of trench warfare," offering as proof a list that includes
terms and phrases such as "<i>blood, terror, agony, madness, shit,
cruelty, murder, . . . screaming all night, bleeding to death from the
rectum,</i> and the like" (<i>GWM,</i> 170). Censorship and propaganda,
however, sought to hide the truth about the war, silencing bodies in pain
for the sake of "public decency." Hanley's story comes closer than most
to communicating the horror and torture that British soldiers suffered
and inflicted upon others during the war--too close, in fact, for the
comfort of the state. Written at a time when Europe was already uneasily
contemplating its next war, "The German Prisoner" describes a war crime
involving sexually aroused British soldiers who horribly mutilate and
violate the helpless body of their German enemy. Citing obscenity laws,
the government burned every copy of this dangerous story it could find
in 1933.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
During the war, military training and anti-German propaganda strove to
make men better soldiers both by encouraging homoeroticism among the
troops and, paradoxically, by projecting homophobia onto the enemy. As
Eric Leed cautions, understanding

<b></b>

the war experience requires not merely balancing "its undeniably positive
and negative features," but recognizing "how both the positive and
negative sides of the war are emanations of the same phenomenon."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Accordingly, Joanna Bourke points out that while the development
  of intimate male friendships made the war "less unbearable and more
  human . . . male bonding was not [exclusively] an inevitable, organic
  sentiment of the war: it was in the interests of military authorities
  to foster in servicemen a sense of group solidarity."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Indeed, the military discouraged male bonding when it interfered
  with the war effort. Following the legendary Christmas Day truce
  of 1914, during which men from both sides of the conflict created
  a temporary domestic space by singing carols, sharing food, and
  exchanging souvenirs, "stringent regulations were immediately issued
  to prevent it from happening again, and the whole system of military
  justice was brought into play."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  The proper lesson to learn from Christmas was not universal
  brotherhood, the military urged, but "redemption through suffering,"
  which would "make men hard" (ibid.).

<p>
Even as soldiers were encouraged to make themselves hard, they
simultaneously learned to mark the enemy as feminine and sexually
deviant. Recent feminist scholarship perceives war as a "gendering
activity that ritually marks the gender" of all its participants,
whether combatant or civilian.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  During World War I, the British gender system extended the binary
  opposition of masculine/feminine to battlefront/homefront and
  soldier/enemy as part of an overall pattern of control. The reality
  of trench warfare--where men cowered helplessly below the earth at the
  mercy of shells exploding above them--provoked a crisis of masculinity
  evident not just in "a generalized sexual anxiety" but also, as Sandra
  Gilbert observes, in "a sexual anger directed specifically against"
  the feminine.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Demonization of the enemy operated as a vital mechanism for the war's
  continuance: killing without remorse and maintaining aggression in an
  essentially defensive war required combatants to un-recognize their
  German opponent, to identify him as not-man and bond together as men
  in pursuit of his destruction. Thus, as Claire Tylee concludes, by
  valorizing heroic sacrifice and tragic martyrdom, the dominant myths
  of World War I gloss over the army's manipulation of masculine ideals
  in order to drive men to their maximum killing potential (<i>GW,</i>
  254-5). "The German Prisoner" reminds us why men are sent to war--to
  kill and maim each other--demonstrating how ethnic and class divisions,
  homophobia, and misogyny help make this carnage possible.

<!--_a-head-->
Empire, Class, and "The German Prisoner"
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Foregrounding the hostility and alienation of British imperial society,
James Hanley's proletarian Irish perspective challenges the myth of
a collective loss of innocence that suffuses officers' memoirs and
continues to dominate cultural memory. Many soldiers experienced and
remembered World War I as being profoundly influenced by their ethnicity
and class status. Britain in 1914 was a nation troubled by the appalling
conditions of urban slums, suffragist challenges to patriarchy, threats
of strikes at home, and imminent civil war in Ireland. As Tylee points
out, the "prelapsarian fantasy" of a prewar,

<b></b>

unified nation reflecting British nostalgia for an idealized childhood
and "lost imperial splendor" is specific to the upper-class English male
(<i>GW,</i> 245). In Sassoon's <i>Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man,</i>
Rebecca West finds a "heartrending portrait of a class that was allowed
to play at being children until the war came, and then was delivered,
bound hand and foot, to the forces of hell."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Hanley's life and fiction, however, provide a powerful corrective
  to the notion that prewar Britain nurtured innocence and idealism
  in all its youth. His 1931 novel, <i>Boy</i>--in which a cabin boy
  is repeatedly molested by older men, infected with syphilis in an
  Alexandrian brothel, and then tossed overboard like garbage--describes
  a hellish alternative to Sassoon's extended adolescence.

<p>
Born in Dublin , Hanley spent most of his childhood in an immigrant
community in Liverpool before going to sea at the age of thirteen to
serve as a ship's boy. Whatever his experiences were at sea, combat
apparently offered a more attractive alternative. Deserting ship in New
Brunswick, he lied about his age and signed up with the Canadian army,
eventually serving with shock troops in France.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  After being discharged with injuries sustained in a gas attack, Hanley
  returned to Liverpool, where he struggled for years against poverty,
  working, among other menial jobs, as a docker and racetrack cashier.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Hanley thus describes the war from the perspective of a working-class
  soldier who experiences the dehumanization of the trenches as an
  intensification of, rather than a radical departure from, his position
  in society.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
"The German Prisoner" opens as a battalion of men from Dublin, Cork,
Donegal, and England's industrial slums hunker down for a night in a
bombed-out house that resembles a stable. Treated like animals, the men
behave and smell accordingly. They attack their food with "savagery"
and fill the rooms with their sweat and "their almost pesty breath"
("GP," 7). Within this bestiary, two huddle apart. Hanley makes clear
the closeted nature of their relationship when he writes, "In the darkest
corner of one of the rooms on the ground floor lay two men . . . facing
each other" in a "recumbent position" (ibid.). The taller and heavier
of the men, Peter O'Garra, is Irish, impoverished, and inverted--on
the ladder of the British Empire you can't descend much lower than
this. O'Garra's companion, Elston, is also working-class. Born in the
slums of Manchester, and described by O'Garra as the "suck-holing type,"
he occupies a position only fractionally better. Parodying the officers'
familiar sentimentality, Elston misses the "smoke and fog and grease"
of his home and feels nostalgic for his "little corner of the world,"
filthy and rotten though it may be. O'Garra, by contrast, harbors
no regrets for the "drab life of Tara Street," with "its lousiness,
its human animals herded together, its stinkin' mattresses" ("GP,"
9). During World War I, Dublin boasted the worst slums in Europe, with
one-third of its population crammed into single rooms that housed up
to twenty people who slept as many as eight in a bed. Such conditions
bred a tuberculosis rate twice as high as London's. It is therefore not
surprising that Dublin,which also manifested the highest death rate and
greatest percentage of people living in poverty of any city in the United
Kingdom, inspired little nostalgia in those who left.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  Further, Dubliners who migrated to English cities such as Liverpool
  often found themselves isolated in pockets of Irish abjection,
  reliving the circumstances they had fled.

<b></b>

<p>
Britain's justification of imperialism as a civilizing mission
necessitated by the colonial subject's primitivism was fine-tuned in
Ireland; and for the Irish who came to work in England, class antagonisms
fused with ethnic stereotyping.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  The discourse of British racial superiority required the Irish male
  to be less than a man, whether in Matthew Arnold's well-intentioned
  celebration of the feminine qualities of the Celt or in the vicious
  satires of <i>Punch.</i> One such satire, entitled "The Missing Link,"
  detailed how explorers venturing into "the lowest districts of London
  and Liverpool" would encounter "the lowest species of Irish Yahoo
  . . . a climbing animal . . . ascending a ladder laden with a hod
  of bricks," ready to attack "civilised beings that have provoked
  its fury."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  During the war, both the arrival of a German ship on the Irish coast
  and the Easter Rising  confirmed fears of Irish treachery and
  violence. And the identification of the Irish enemy with sexual
  deviance was simultaneously reinforced by the execution of Roger
  Casement for treason  following the revelation of scandalous
  diaries containing evidence of homosexual encounters throughout the
  colonies. According to Enda Duffy, Casement's "rebellious patriotic
  martyrdom" was thereby "transformed by insinuation into a discourse of
  forbidden sexuality," and his "choice of political action" reduced to
  "the merely predictable expression of an inner secret."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
Given the wartime association of the Irish with treason, sexual deviance,
and subhumanity, it is easy to see why Hanley rejected the "known literary
forms" that Fussell insists war writers could not avoid (<i>GWM,</i>
174). Rather, Hanley's war memoir bypasses the mythic chivalry of English
national literature for the idiom of jingoistic, working-class humor he
had internalized from British satires of the Irish people's attempts to
overcome biology. There is much of the "stage Irishman" about O'Garra
(whose very name has echoes of "begorra," an expression prominent in
Irish theater), and indeed, at times, Hanley appears to be writing stage
directions rather than description.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  O'Garra spits on the floor, "following up the action by drawing the
  flat of his hand across his mouth" ("GP," 8). As the troops prepare
  to move out, O'Garra and Elston execute a pratfall straight from the
  music hall:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Suddenly O'Garra slipped into a hole.
<br />
"Jesus Christ! Already," growled Elston.
<br />
He dragged O'Garra out, following up the action by falling in
himself. ["GP,"11]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such exaggerated actions emphasize the absurdity of the humiliating and
degrading role they must perform in order to survive. There is no touch of
elegy, no sense of sacrifice in Hanley's description of battle, which he
records with darkly physical humor. A sergeant named Grundy announces his
intention to "post certain men," provoking "all and sundry" to break into
"loud cursing and obscene oaths" ("GP," 17). Brains belonging to a soldier
named Gorman end up splattered on O'Garra's forehead. And in another scene
Elston screams "like a stuck pig" on finding himself "drenched in blood":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Oh funkin' hell. I'm killed. I'm dead. O'Garra. O'Garra. O'Garra."
<br />
"Shut up," growled the Irishman. "Can't you see that bugger behind
you. You got a belt in the back with his head. See. He hasn't any
now. That whizz-bang took his head and his arse off him at the same
time. . . ." ["GP," 19]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The voices Hanley records with such accuracy in "The German Prisoner"
are those from "the end of the line," the lowest level of combat troops,
lacking either agency or access to information about their fate.

<p>
Joanna Bourke notes that "the ideology of male comradeship in war
was never intended to subvert military rank and its association with
socioeconomic class"; at the height of the battle the men do their job,
which is not to think, but to move forward, to follow orders (<i>DM,</i>
145). They form a corporate body, a "huge eyeless monster that forge[s]
its way ahead towards some inevitable destiny. Nothing more" ("GP,"
12). At times, however, the mass disintegrates into its constituent
parts. One memorable scene from "The German Prisoner" deflates the
classic war texts' romanticization of the officer's relationship to
his men. Knowing that a guide waits for them a thousand yards ahead,
an officer worries about his men for strategic reasons alone: some
might die, yes, but to leave them out in the open would "disclose (more
importantly) the movements of troops . . . to the Germans" and ruin the
element of surprise ("GP," 14). "Far back, at the very tail end of this
file of men," Elston and O'Garra have been worrying about the officer's
competence, complaining that "that bugger in front" can't re out what
to do. As the cover of darkness lifts, the men begin to panic--"what
had merely been a germ, became a disease, an epidemic. The torment
was no longer private, but general. . . . When something went wrong,
the more sensitive spirits became agitated. One saw it in their eyes"
("GP," 15). After a bombardment kills seven men, the troops issue their
own orders: "RUN FOR IT" ("GP," 16).

<p>
As John Keegan shows, the average soldier answers to a different
imperative than the officer: "the concepts 'win' and 'lose' through
which a commander . . . approach[es] a battle are by no means the same
as those through which his men will view their own involvement in it."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Studies of human behavior in combat reveal that men identify themselves
  in terms of a "very tiny" group, "perhaps no more than six or seven
  men." Group members begin to t and continue to t for two
  reasons: "personal survival, which individuals will recognize to be
  bound up with group survival" and the "fear of incurring by cowardly
  conduct the group's contempt."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Further, noting the "immense burden" masculine comradeship placed on
 men "to express martial values," Bourke observes that in World War I,
 "the fear of being thought to be a coward was intense" (<i>DM,</i>
 151-2). Tylee adds that to feel fear provoked deep shame in a man,
 causing him to "despise himself as he might a member of an 'inferior'
 race or a girl" (<i>GW,</i> 125). Masculinity taught men to repress
 fear of the other within, thereby directing shame and self-loathing
 into aggression against a designated object outside themselves.

<p>
Of the two men, O'Garra seems to be the better soldier, having learned
the masculine ability to maintain control over himself and other men. He
brags about surviving the first gas attack, and he repeatedly pulls
Elston out of danger as the other man whimpers for his mother.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  Years of abuse on a filthy street in the most despised corner of the
  British Empire have steeled O'Garra against attacks. The litany of
  insults with which his Dublin neighbors revile him constitutes the same
  equation between homosexuality and treason found in British propaganda:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
a lousy bugger--a rake--a closet--a quiet fellow--a tub of guts--a
pimp--a shit-house--a toad--a sucker--a blasted sod--a Holy Roller--a Tara
lemon--a Judas--a jumped-up liar--a book-worm--a traitor to Ireland--a
pervert--an Irish jew--an Irish Christ--a clod. ["GP," 8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite their rejection of him as "a traitor to Ireland," O'Garra's
countrymen uphold British associations of Ireland with deviance, using
"Irish" and "Tara" as intensifiers of their own scorn. Demonized as a
pervert, an animal, and a traitor to race and religion, O'Garra seeks
in aggression a more acceptable alternative to this identity. We learn
that he "went for a soldier" to keep from giving in to "blood" that was
"heavy with surrender" ("GP," 9). War is just "blood bitterness," he
tells Elston, "and bitter blood is good blood" (ibid.). This struggle
has taken its toll, however. His eyes, which Hanley compares to "the
dried up beds of African lakes," reveal the double repression of his
identity as racialized colonial subject and as sexual other.

<p>
O'Garra has so internalized society's prejudices that he can't open his
mouth without a disparaging remark about "buggers" and "sods." Self-hatred
translates his attraction to Elston as hate at first sight: "When first he
had set eyes on Elston, he had despised him, there was something in this
man utterly repugnant to him" ("GP," 10). From his first encounter with
this "human rat," this Englishman of the "suck-holing type," O'Garra
obsesses about how despicable he finds the other man, penning verses
that testify to Elston's uniqueness as an object of scorn.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Annihilating Desire
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
A cultural complex of homophobia, misogyny, racial and class
discrimination, and repressed sexual desire erupt into violence and
brutality in the relationship between O'Garra and Elston, provoking their
rape and murder of a German prisoner. The anxiety shared by cultural
historians over pronounced homoeroticism in literary representations
of the war is exemplified by Fussell's coining of the phrase "chaste
homosexuality" to bolster his claim that virtually <i>none</i> of
these crushes were ever consummated. In fact, between 1914 and 1919,
"twenty-two officers and 270 other ranks were court-martialed for
'indecency' with another man."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Reminding us that "the war provided opportunities for erotic
  relationships among men which were not necessarily available in
  peacetime," Trudi Tate suggests we examine <i>why</i> the idea of
  homosexuality has been so obdurately resisted.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Certainly the identification during and after the war of homosexuality
  as a <i>German</i> practice provided an added incentive for men to
  remain silent about their own behavior: newspapers condemned infection
  by "German homosexuality" as threatening "the patriotism, stamina,
  intellect and morale" of the troops.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
In "The German Prisoner," however, the fog of war is also the fog of
desire, even if O'Garra and Elston consistently misname and misrecognize
their passion. The lid is clamped down so tightly that neither can
envision the realization of his desire without an eruption of violence. As
the troops "go over the top" into no-man's-land,

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
every sound and every movement seemed to strike a responsive chord in the
Irishman's nature. He hung on desperately to the Manchester man. . . . He
could not understand this sudden desire for Elston's company. But the
desire overwhelmed him. ["GP," 19]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Something about battle turns O'Garra on. Seeing a once-foolish officer's
"headless body" stirs "something deep down in the bosom of his soul"
("GP," 28). After they lose contact with their battalion, the fog deepens
and Elston regards O'Garra with "a sudden gust of fear and passion,"
wondering "did this man really mean to murder him" ("GP," 22).

<p>
When O'Garra looks "across at the huddled form of the Manchester man,"
he heaves a sigh, acknowledging, but still unable to articulate, his
yearning: "Now the whole of his past shot across the surface of that mind"
(ibid.). Remembering "those lonely nights, those fruitless endeavors"
spent searching for a woman, O'Garra concludes, "surely they took on
a richer texture now. . . . [A]chieved a certain significance" ("GP,"
22-3). He defers his sexual confusion with a deep meditation on what
will happen after the war. Unable to re out why he "had come into all
this muck and mud and madness," he gropes instead for a suitable target
for the grudge he believes "everyone in the war must bear," wondering
"would they all demand retribution? Would they all wreak a terrible
vengeance?" ("GP," 23).

<p>
Waking from this reverie, O'Garra realizes that his watch has stopped,
imparting to the scene the strange, surrealistic quality of a dream
sequence. Suddenly, out of the mist emerges a handsome German soldier
boy embodying the homoerotic ideal described by classic war memoirs.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  Hanley invokes him lyrically, as "tall, with a form as graceful as
  a young sapling," with hair "as fair as ripe corn, . . . blue eyes,
  and finely molded features" ("GP," 24). In the ensuing brutal scene,
  "The German Soldier" enacts the men's projection of unsafe desire on
  an enemy who must consequently be destroyed.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  Calling out repeatedly, "Camerade. Camerade," the German boy pleads
  for recognition of their common humanity. Initially Elston recognizes
  this appeal, responding that they too are lost and asking, "Is it
  foggy where you came from? . . . [W]e'll never get out of this hole,
  only by stirring ourselves together and making a bolt for it" ("GP,"
  25). O'Garra, however, chokes off the possibility of fellowship with
  a torrent of homophobic slurs, warning Elston, "perhaps this sod is
  leading us into a trap. Why not finish the bugger off, anyhow?" In the
  fog of war, innocence provokes violence, and murder reveals its erotic
  potential. O'Garra and Elston savagely kick the screaming prisoner's
  face into a bloody pulp. The remorse and horror they feel afterwards
  ends quickly. Reminiscing about an earlier incident, in which O'Garra
  pulled another soldier off an old woman during what appears to have
  been a serial rape, the two excitedly urinate over the prisoner. And
  their subsequent expressions of renewed vigor are clearly postcoital:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Hell!" exclaimed O'Garra. "After that I feel relieved. Refreshed. Don't
feel tired. Don't feel anything particularly. How do you feel?" he asked.
<br />
"The same," replied Elston. "But I wish to Christ this soddin' fog would
lift." ["GP," 30]

<p>
The world of "The German Prisoner" is liquid with water, blood, tears,
urine, and fog, evoking a dissolution of control and leaking across
borders associated with a pronounced anxiety toward the feminine. Elston
and O'Garra experience desire as "a ceaseless yearning, the restlessness
of waters washing against the floodgates of the soul" (ibid.). O'Garra
kicks the German savagely in the face, and seeing "the stream of blood
gush forth from the German's mouth," he bursts "into tears" ("GP,"
27). Elston spits in the face of the German, whose own saliva will
trickle down his chin later as he cowers in the hole ("GP," 25-6). The
German prisoner seems almost entirely fluid--and feminine. He weeps;
he calls out repeatedly for water; his sigh has a "liquidity of tone";
he reminds Elston of "all the beauty and music and rhythm of the Rhine";
and he seems ready to dissolve at any time into the mud ("GP," 31-2). The
battlefield is also fluid, resembling a cosmic whirlpool--a vast, primal,
devouring mother. In the heat of battle, "the earth was alive--afire. The
earth was a mouth, it was a sea, a yawning gulf, a huge maw" ("GP,"
19). Terms like "mouth, gulf, and maw" resonate with the threat of female
genitalia. Indeed, O'Garra's own mouth suggests the monstrous feminine:
"If one wished to know O'Garra, one looked at his mouth," the narrator
comments ("GP," 9). O'Garra's mouth makes him "more than a man" and the
false teeth clicking in his "ugly mouth" elicit a castrating potential,
a vagina dentata ("GP," 8).

<p>
Desire in "The German Prisoner" expresses itself as contamination,
pollution, threat: "There is a peculiar power about rottenness," Hanley
insists, and O'Garra feels himself helpless before Elston's peculiar
power. As their anxiety increases and they escalate their torture of the
prisoner, the Tommies vent their "unclean" feelings through repeated
references to defecation. In an obvious request for anal sex, Elston
growls at O'Garra: "My <i>arse</i> on you. . . . Let's worry each other
to death. Isn't that better than sitting here like soft shits. That time I
fell asleep I did it in my pants" ("GP," 33). Elston calls O'Garra a "big
shit house" as they stare at each other, transfixed with desire and rage
("GP," 35). Seeing the mangled body of the prisoner sink beneath the mud,
O'Garra screams out, "I hate this thing so much I want to shite on it"
("GP," 36). Noting that "sexual fantasies played a large role in wartime
propaganda," Mosse describes the "vogue" in Germany for "scatological
postcards, uncensored because the fantasies were projected onto the
enemy, depicted as covered with excrement, their bodies and even sexual
organs exposed."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  In Hanley's story, the abject body of the prisoner functions similarly
  as a field upon which both murderous aggression and transgressive
  desire can be projected and commingled.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
The body of the German prisoner offers an acceptable outlet for the
British soldiers' rage against their own victimization by a classist
society. Their problems are not with any particular "Jerry" so much
as with a society that considers them filth because of their class,
race, or sexuality and sends them off to war to die. As he torments the
prisoner, Elston asks him, "Why should you not suffer as well as us?" then
repeats the words of his persecutor, Sargent Grundy--"Shit on you"
("GP," 25). Moreover, according to Eric Leed, such behavior announces
the success of Elston's military training, in which the officer treats
the recruit "the same way that he wants the soldier to treat the enemy
in battle. To escape the low and painful status of victim," the soldier

<b></b>

must identify with the aggressor. Such identification enables "the
soldier's activity in war--all the shooting, maiming, and killing--to
be perceived as moral, legitimate, and meaningful."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The complex system of division by which society operates becomes
 intensified in wartime, firmly fixing categories of good and
 evil. Because O'Garra and Elston do not initially blame the German
 prisoner for their predicament, we can see how "evil" is constructed
 and what it takes to assume the mantle of aggressor.

<p>
The men's increasing desire for each other provokes a corresponding
intensification of their denunciations against the prisoner. Initially
O'Garra condemns Elston for losing them in the fog, insisting that "its
you and not this bloody Jerry who is responsible" ("GP," 26). When the
German's sigh interrupts O'Garra's invective against Elston, O'Garra
begins to refocus his rage, accusing the prisoner of being "as much to
blame as anybody" ("GP," 27). Finally, he and Elston, far gone in their
mutual seduction, decide that "That bastard lying there is the cause of
all this," thus allowing them to transfer anxiety over illicit emotions
to a safe object ("GP," 30). As soldiers, they have been taught to view
the German as an acceptable target of violence and to consider murder
as less transgressive than sex with another man.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Klaus Theweleit's analysis of narratives by the Friekorps--the "white
troops" who graduated from postwar persecution of communists to the elite
ranks of Hitler's S. S.--attempts to uncover systems of desire driving
cultures of war and violence. He argues that versions of masculinity
compel mastery of the body (sometimes through torture) to produce
hardness and a destructive edge. Giving in to the female signifies
"being swallowed, engulfed, annihilated. Women's bodies are the holes,
swamps, pits of muck that can engulf."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  The troops thus conceive their violence against women as
  "self-defense," a preemptive strike against a "threatening element,"
  with the affective mode of such defense being "<i>fear</i> and
  <i>desire</i>" (<i>MF,</i> 183; italics in original).

<p>
"The German Prisoner" describes a similarly violent acting out of a
simultaneously sexual and homicidal conflict. The feminine--including
the enemy soldier--is marked as deviant and threatening, and must be
destroyed. Accordingly, O'Garra and Elston objectify the German man as a
"body," an "it": "With peculiar movements of the hands" they begin to
"mangle the body" and to worry "it like mad dogs" ("GP," 32). Contact
with the "youth's soft skin" and "the velvety touch of the flesh" leave
Elston "infuriated," "demented," and "maddened" (ibid.). O'Garra and
Elston use this body to bridge the gap of their repressed homosexual
desire, relieving the pressure they feel by penetrating and puncturing
the boy. O'Garra sticks his bayonet "up the youth's anus" and both
insert a horse hair into his penis. Describing violent erotic murder
by the Freikorps as "two male compulsions . . . tearing at the woman,"
Theweleit explains, "the man pushes the woman far away (takes her life),
and gets very close to her (penetrates her with a bullet, stab wound,
club, etc.)" (<i>MF,</i> 196). Once she has been reduced to a bloody mass,
losing her "identity as an object with concrete dimensions and a unique
name," the man can breathe a sigh of relief. . . .What we are dealing
with here is the dissolution of the body itself, and of the woman as
bodily entity as well as love object" (ibid.).

<p>
O'Garra and Elston, however, will not "breathe a sigh of relief" at the
death of the boy, for the feminine also includes parts of themselves in
conflict with rigidly structured

<b></b>

ideals of masculinity that can be neither externalized nor destroyed. The
bloody body of the boy operates successively as an impediment to the
murderous rage and desire they feel for each other. The two decide to
"bury this thing. . . . If we don't destroy him, he'll destroy us,
even though he's dead" ("GP," 35). They "bury" the body by jumping
up and down on it, trampling it beneath the mud, just as O'Garra has
seen a Dublin woman trample a dog. Once the prisoner is gone, "their
very beings" seem "to burst into flame," and they realize "there is
no way out" ("GP," 36). They hurl themselves together, not realizing
that the fog has lifted enough to reveal their position. After the
smoke from an incoming shell has cleared, O'Garra can be seen with
"tortured features," his eyes "gouged out, whilst beneath his powerful
frame" lies "the remains of Elston" (ibid.). The pair is visible "for
a moment only" before they sink into a common grave with their victim,
"beneath the sea of mud" oozing "over them like the restless tide of
an everlasting night" (ibid.).

<p>
According to Tim O'Brien, if you feel at the end of a war story that
"some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste,
then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  Indeed, we see such a salvage operation in the "Introductory Note"
  to "The German Prisoner," written by Richard Aldington, author
  of war memoirs and the celebrated novel, <i>Death of a Hero.</i>
  Praising Hanley for the "force and vitality" with which he depicts
  "the unspeakable wrong . . . worked upon human souls by those who
  are supposed to be its guardians and guides," Aldington reconstructs
  O'Garra and Elston as suffering innocents who are "driven" and
  "tortured" to madness. Rounding up the usual suspects--old men and
  women distributing white feathers--Aldington rebuffs their objections
  to the "dreadfully dirty words" these characters use: "If you were
  not ashamed to send men into the war, why should you blush to read
  what they said in it? . . . Though the world will little note nor
  long remember what they did there, perhaps it will not hurt you to
  know a little of what they said and suffered."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In his insistence on what the men "said" and "suffered," Aldington
  himself seems to have difficulty remembering "what they did there." By
  refusing to acknowledge that they are rapists and murderers, Aldington
  recuperates a fantasy of sacrificial victims purified through suffering
  that works to perpetuate the mythology of war.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
English military cemeteries of World War I are designed around a Cross
of Sacrifice and a Stone of Remembrance hewn in the shape of an altar,
projecting a Christian symbolism over rows and rows of identical graves
and headstones whose uniformity is "reminiscent of wartime camaraderie."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Refusing such standard issue commemoration, Hanley chooses to remember
  the fallen differently. While in Hanley's description of O'Garra's
  disgust for his victim--"Everything I look at becomes Him. Everything
  Him"--the capitalized pronoun links the suffering of the German
  prisoner with the suffering of Christ, the re of Christ has been
  "plastered in shite" after "a five-nine landed behind it," pitching it
  "into one of the latrines" ("GP," 35, 13). Roadside crosses remind
  O'Garra of "the Irish Christ. All blood and tears," and he refuses
  to look at them, perhaps remembering his own persecution as an "Irish
  Christ" as well as a "shit house" ("GP," 13, 8). By establishing the
  connection between Peter O'Garra, Otto

<b></b>

from Muenchen, and Jesus Christ, and by heaping them with shit, Hanley
exposes the inevitable degradation of every person and every ideal that
participates in the obscenity of war and forecloses the possibility of
meaningful sacrifice.

<p>
"The German Prisoner" has been suppressed and ignored because its story
of men achieving pleasure in brutality, murder, and self-destruction does
not represent the way people have wanted to remember the war. According to
the dominant narrative, only two legitimate manifestations of masculinity
existed during World War I--heterosexuality and violence. Manliness
required repeated acts of courage (violence) to "prove" heterosexuality,
which nevertheless remained always in doubt. The myth that the love
between men was limited to a transcendent, "chaste" homoeroticism
sentimentalizes the compulsory heterosexuality behind an extreme form of
masculinity that channels desire, rage, and fear into the savage murder
of other men in battle. Comradeship in "The German Prisoner" cannot be
separated from the horror of war because it is an essential ingredient of
that horror. Hanley's profoundly disturbing memory of World War I raises
powerful questions about the cost of unity during violent conflicts.

Although Hanley's work is little known today and his novels are
largely out of print, his more famous contemporaries held his work in
high regard. William Faulkner lauded Hanley's originality and style,
calling his work, "not British, not American. . . . Just language
like a good, clean cyclone." Frank G. Harrington, <i>James Hanley: A
Bold and Unique Solitary</i> (Francestown, N.H.: Typographeum, 1989),
10. Calling him "a powerful writer," Alfred A. Knopf deemed Hanley's work
"genuinely important." Linnea Gibbs, <i>James Hanley: A Bibliography</i>
(Vancouver: William Hoffer, 1980), 128. In his introduction to the reissue
of <i>Boy</i> (the novel confiscated and burned for obscenity along with
"The German Prisoner"), Anthony Burgess remarks, "The geniuses who are
neglected are usually the geniuses who disturb, and we do not like to be
disturbed." James Hanley, <i>Boy</i> (London: Deutsch, 1990), vii. That
Hanley was popularly regarded as a writer of some eminence is further
illustrated by the title to his 1985 obituary in the <i>Times,</i>
"The Neglected Genius of the Novel."

Published during a boom in writing about World War I, "The German
Prisoner" represents both an important document of wartime trauma and a
powerful expression of postwar anxieties, particularly those suffered by
the working-class veteran. "The German Prisoner" shares with Hanley's
other work from the early 1930s (the eleven texts published between
1930 and 1934 that earned him the designation of proletarian writer)
the theme of the individual in the throes of overwhelming extremity,
often inflicted by brutal male authority res--employers, priests,
teachers, fathers. Particularly compelling are Hanley's depictions of
masculinity within the working-class immigrant family, as men who are
brutally oppressed by other men struggle to preserve authority within
their own homes.

Arguing that the disillusionment of the bourgeois volunteer constituted a
"militarized proletarianization," Eric Leed observes that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in their reaction to the work-war, their resignation to meaningless,
boring, endless, and dangerous jobs, many of the uniformed upper
and middle classes took on the bitterness and resentment formerly
identified with their social inferiors. This bitterness was directed at
the 'managers' of war, the staff, as well as those at home who enjoyed
'security and comfort' and could not understand the suffering of the
men at the front. [<i>No Man's Land,</i> 94]

the law dictated should be allocated for livestock. Buildings intended for
single-family use would have as many as eighty to one hundred residents,
with only one toilet in the yard to service them all. As Kearns points
out, investigative reporting and government studies from the turn of
the century reveal conditions in which



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
it was common to find human excreta scattered about the yards and hallway
passages. Privies and ashpits sometimes became infested with typhoid germs
and yards were regularly flooded withstagnant water and waste creating
an environment in which flies, insects and vermin thrived. . . . Multiple
layers of decomposing wallpaper provided a perfect sanctuary for colonies
of insects while rats as big as cats nested in rotting floor-boards and
roamed freely at night, even entering the beds of nursing mothers and
their infants, drawn by the scent of milk. [12]

vastly different from a middle-class product of the public school system.

In these early stories, the self-educated Hanley does not quite have
control of his conventions, producing a wonderful unevenness that,
paradoxically, enables him to get to what's really going on. According to
Hanley's biographer, the author "was not uncritical of his . . . early
work. Too many of the books were written too hastily, he said, under
pressure to earn money" (Harrington, <i>James Hanley,</i> 26). Alan Ross
says of Hanley's earliest pieces that Hanley "aimed, sometimes obliquely,
sometimes directly, at transcription more than description." He is
"a novelist who does not plan, who has no cut-and-dried story, but
whose work is the journey back into his own consciousness." Alan Ross,
introduction to <i>The Last Voyage and Other Stories,</i> by James Hanley
(London: Harvill, 1997), xiv. Whether from lack of time or skill, or as a
conscious technique, Hanley's work feels remarkably free of conventional
dialogue--as if, says Jane Marcus, "he's recording real voices."

"How funny," O'Garra tells Elston, "that in the moment I first realized
your cowardice, I became conscious of my own strength. I must have
pulled you a mile, you swine" ("GP," 21-2). While O'Garra means that he
discovered unknown reserves of power, this episode marks the beginning
of his dissolution. It is instructive to compare "The German Prisoner"
to <i>The Return of the Brute,</i> a war memoir by Liam O'Flaherty,
a proletarian Irish writer severely shell-shocked in the war. In
O'Flaherty's novel, the cowardice of a young soldier infects a hardened
Irish veteran named Private Gunn, prompting Gunn's descent into a madness
that culminates in a suicidal attack in which he strangles his commanding
officer, "uttering queer sounds" and mangling the body with his bare
hands . The boy in O'Flaherty's story embodies the homoerotic
ideal, with "pink cheeks, dazzling white teeth like a girl and big blue
eyes" . Referred to frequently as a "woman" and a "girl," the boy
reminds Gunn of his former wife, and his weakness feels like "seductive
temptation" to Gunn . Liam O'Flaherty, <i>Return of the Brute</i>
(London: Wolfhound Press, 1998). What interests me in both of these
stories is how quickly these Irish soldiers lose their tenuous hold
on masculinity and return to "the brute" when faced with a feminized
English comrade.

Jacqueline Rose's study of psychoanalytic accounts of war reveals a
profound disturbance in that "seemingly secure distinction" between
projection and reality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If I project aggression on to the other, she or he is likely to
become--in reality--the mirror or embodiment of the aggression I am
trying to displace on to him or her. In other words, paranoid impulses
don't just project on to reality as delusion; they affect reality and
become a component of it. [28]

<p>
Given this scenario, asks Rose, "how can you recognize the real
enemy. . . . Or rather, how can you distinguish, with absolute certainty,
between your own projections and real external danger? If you produce
the enemy, then you must t him" (28-9). Jacqueline Rose, <i>Why

Carolyn Dean argues that only after the Great War, "when social
commentators and analysts began to postulate a significant link between
the wartime proliferation of pornography and the unprecedented violence
of modern combat," did "pornography and violence become continuous with
descriptions of assaults on the integrity of the human body" . She
writes that many critics in the interwar period



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
no longer equate self-sacrifice with spiritual cleansing, but with
spiritual degradation; the body has become enslaved by its own instincts,
or more specifically, by a compulsive death-drive. . . . The war's
degradation of men's dignity is red in the putatively emasculating
and sexually pathological pleasure of humiliating and being humiliated,
of exposing and being exposed. The war, in this view, had turned into
a pretext for the satisfaction of other pleasures. [63]

Ferguson reports that "on occasions, and with encouragement from some
commanders" British soldiers went into battle determined to take no
prisoners . Even for those with no such intentions, it was difficult,
in the words of one soldier, "once you start killing," to "turn a man off
like an engine" (Ferguson, <i>The Pity of War,</i> 380). Ferguson contends
that the "number of incidents is not as important as the impression they
made on the culture of the trenches. Men magnified these incidents; they
passed into trench mythology" on both sides, discouraging surrender and
prolonging the war (ibid., 386). The episode with the prisoner belongs
to "trench mythology"--except that Hanley's atrocity does not come from
the other side.

1970), which exemplifies the useless sacrifice of noble innocents. In
this story, an officer--whom Aldington calls Hanley--suffers anguish
as he prepares to carry out orders for a suicide mission in which he
must sacrifice his own life and that of a subaltern. He is particularly
anguished by the realization that while he will soon be "a mass of dead
rotting decay," his wife will remain "young and beautiful and desirable"
and eager to replace him in her bed . See Tate for a discussion of
the hysterical repudiation of homosexuals as 'half-men' and 'scented
worms'" articulated by Winterbourne in <i>Death of a Hero</i> and by
Aldington himself in his personal correspondence (Tate, <i>Modernism,
History,</i> 81-3).

Ferguson noted the paradox that while they were "weary of the war, men
do not seem to have been weary of violence" (Ferguson, <i>The Pity of
War,</i> 388). British veterans known as the "Black and Tans" carried out
brutal assaults on Irish Republicans; their withdrawal initiated an even
bloodier civil war. British troops used "extreme violence" in suppressing
riots in Egypt in 1919 and revolts in Palestine and Iraq in 1920 in which
"some 1,500 Egyptians were killed in the space of eight weeks, while
in Iraq General Sir Aylmer Haldane even contemplated using poison gas"
(ibid., 390). In "one of the most seminal atrocities of British imperial
history," soldiers in Amritsar killed 379 people at a political meeting
on 11 April 1919. The toll would have been greater if Brigadier-General
Reginald Dyer "had been able to deploy two armoured cars with machine
guns." The "techniques of mass murder patented on the Western Front"
were now being exported for use in the colonies (ibid., 390-1).
