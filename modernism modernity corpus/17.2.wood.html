<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  “A Soldier of Humour,” the opening story of Wyndham Lewis’s 1927 collection of short stories entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span>, is a neglected but important document in the history of modernism. Initially completed on the front line at the Battle of Messines Ridge, provocatively published in 1917–18 in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span>, and then extensively reworked during the 1920s, the story is central to Lewis’s thinking throughout the middle period of his career. Although <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> is usually seen as a document of early modernism, marked by a savagely satiric anti-humanism, we can instead read “A Soldier of Humour” as an expression of the social and cultural anxiety in England which results from the political and economic rise of America during the 1920s. Taken together with Lewis’s theoretical statements in “The Meaning of the Wild Body,’” this story points towards a distinctively late modern poetics in Lewis’s work.

<h1 class="sec-headA">“A Soldier of Humour”</h1>
<p>
	Looking back to the 1920s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting and Bombardiering</span> , Wyndham Lewis defined a period of self-imposed exile in his career. After publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Tarr</span> in 1918 “I buried myself,” Lewis wrote. “I disinterred myself in 1926, the year of the General Strike.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> But this is no simple bibliographic exercise. Rebirth is cast in mythological terms; Lewis is “disinterred,” not simply dug up, and steps out of his grave like a mummified king, brought back to the light from an intellectual cocoon. These have not been barren years: he left the world one diagnosis and he returns with a new one. A good deal of academic criticism has subsequently used Lewis’s demarcation of the General Strike as a waypoint for navigating his career and modernism more broadly.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> But little attention has been paid to Lewis’s immediate artistic concern as he rises from his rhetorical tomb. For it is not <span style="font-style:italic;">The Childermass</span>  or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Apes of God</span>  that initially focuses Lewis’s attention, but rather the short stories with which he commenced his career in 1907 and which were collected in 1927 as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> These stories represent a direct link from the early Lewis to the mature Lewis.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> And we can perhaps be more even specific, for it is “A Soldier of Humour,” initially published with <span style="font-style:italic;">Tarr</span> in 1917–18 and extensively reworked during the 1920s, which leads and subtitles the collection when Lewis is reborn. This is neither a piece of juvenilia nor an early modernist travel story. Rather it is a crucial document in the evolution of twentieth-century literature, distinctively and uniquely engaging with the rise of American politics and culture in the 1920s.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	“A Soldier of Humour” is, loosely, the story of Lewis’s trip to Europe in 1907 and 1908, told through the use of a first-person narrator called Ker-Orr. Bracketed at the start and the end by bohemian Paris, Ker-Orr travels first to primitive Bayonne and then to the Basque region. Bayonne, an important commercial center of seaborne trade, populated by both Basques and Gascons and sited at the margins of two European countries, provides Lewis with the perfect theater for the story’s confrontation of nationality, race, and origin. In the final 1927 version of the story, Lewis makes Bayonne into a glaringly modern city, distinctly postwar in tone and governed by an economy based on consumption rather than on agriculture. The symbol of this new economy is the hotel, likened to “the blazonry of cheap ice-cream wells, under a striped umbrella,” which acts to entice and menace Ker-Orr like an iridescent Marxist commodity. “Each frail structure shines and sparkles with a hard, livid and disreputable electricity, every floor illuminated,” Ker-Orr records and thereby establishes a series of uneasy oppositions that persist throughout the narrative. What Ker-Orr encounters in Bayonne is a denatured reality where desire consumes the individual. The hotels constitute a “competitive universe,” cut off from a natural world that in contrast is magically “spangled with the vivid spanish stars” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20). This is not the simple primitive Breton backwater, the landscape of peasants, puppets, and primitives typically depicted by academic criticism on these stories.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is also radically different to the Bayonne of Lewis’s contemporaries. Compare it for example to Hemingway’s pastoral Bayonne in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiesta</span>, published a year earlier in 1926. For Hemingway’s narrator, Jake, Bayonne is simply “a nice town . . . . very clean . . . on a big river.” Whereas Ker-Orr sees a “row of rather obscene little hotels, crudely painted,” Jake sees “pigeons out in the square” and “yellow, sunbaked” houses and hotels (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20).<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Hemingway has chosen to detail the picturesque elements of the city as a tourist; Lewis has transformed his initial encounter of 1907 unrecognizably and firmly accentuated its carnivalesque aspects.
      </p>
<p>
	Ker-Orr’s sense of artifice operating behind the scenery of the city is replicated at the level of form. It is not quite clear how we should react to this self-confessed “large blond clown, ever so vaguely reminiscent (in person) of William Blake” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 17). Lewis’s satire, instead of savagely disarming its objective content, is blunt, forced to double back and deliberately challenge its own pretensions to mean: “‘Fonda del Universo,’ ‘Fonda del Mundo’: Universal Inn and World Inn, two of these places were called, I noticed. I was tired and not particular as to which universe I entered. They all looked the same.” As Ker-Orr moves into this internal and unstable world, the pervading sense of duplicity, mystery, and fear continues. Everything inside is too glaringly visible through the “glass roof” and “glass door” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20–21). Special attention is given to one such door of “shining cut-glass” which seems to hold a clue to Ker-Orr’s fate and explain his paranoia: “[It] seemed the direction I ought to take when I should have made up my mind to advance.” The “unsubstantial pretentiously new appearance” of this Bayonne hotel soon starts to uncannily resemble a prototype of Frederic Jameson’s own “‘<span style="font-style:italic;">Fonda del Universo</span>,’” the Bonaventura Hotel, a “total space, a complete world, a kind of miniature city.” Both share a structure composed of mirrors and glass, an essential redefinition of internal space, and a confusion of entrance and exit, of internal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and external pathway.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Both act as spaces of heightened alienation, a concentrated version of the outside world:

<p class="continued">
	  It is in the hotel dining room, “compact with hard light,” that space becomes most supremely condensed. Nothing escapes the light’s persuasiveness, its ability to uncover honesty and newness. The electricity dissolves the object: “My eyes fixed on a piece of cheese which the high voltage of the electricity revealed in all its instability” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 22). The scene dissolves into anthropomorphic grotesqueness:

<p class="continued">
	    The primitivism of the early versions of the wild body stories has evaporated here, replaced instead with an inverted satire that struggles to control the horror implicit in both its content and form.
	  </p>
<p>
	    As Ker-Orr becomes increasingly destabilized he meets Valmore, the uncanny, “sublime,” and predestined source of his paranoia. Valmore is the very corporeal expression of the hotel, secreted into being by its bricks and mortar: “He issued from a void. . . . He was part of the mystery of this hotel; his loneliness, his aplomb, his hardy appetite.” The source of his mystery is an ambiguous national and racial origin, the detail of which is only revealed to us progressively. Initially, Valmore appears to be French born, dressed like a peasant in a straw hat and extravagant suit, from the “grimy commercial Midi,” blank and impersonal (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 21–23). But this is soon replaced by a realization that Valmore is in some way Americanized. It is not until toward the end of the story that it becomes clear that he is a Frenchman by birth and he has subsequently gained some form of actual or cultural citizenship in America. Ker-Orr explains, “‘he hails from the southern part of France, and americanism came to him as a revelation when youth had already passed.’” “‘He won’t leave Englishmen alone. He persecutes them, apparently, wherever he finds them,’” he adds (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 41). This cultural opposition forms the basis of the stories’ subsequent series of <span style="font-style:italic;">agons</span>.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What is crucial in Ker-Orr’s apprehension of this Americanization is his categorization of Valmore’s “illusion of superiority.” He sees Valmore embodying the characteristics of a new empowered class. Valmore carries “the air of being the real thing” and a “careless impudence.” He is “insolently heedless,” full of “colossal disdain,” and rooted by an “air of security” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 25). Valmore is depicted as a modern entrepreneur: hotelier, ship owner, and early property magnate. “‘He owns the Burgalésa and many houses in Pontaisandra. Ships, too—Es Américano,’” Ker-Orr is told by the locals (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 39). His “dark purple-slate suit with thin crimson lines . . . dark redhat-band . . . rose-buff tie, swarming with cerulean fire-flies,” initially seen as the primitive attire of a strawhatted  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> peasant, becomes some kind of modern zoot suit, the “soft national armour” of the “yankee” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 23 and 30). The same chain of concepts is used when Ker-Orr meets three “authentic” American friends, ironically multinational, called Morton, Blauenfeld, and Taffany:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Optimism, consciousness of power (no wonder! I reflected) surged out of them, my simple-hearted friends. Ah, the kindness! the <span style="font-style:italic;">overwhelming</span> kindness. I bathed voluptuously in this american greeting—this real american greeting. Nothing naturalized about <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span>. At the same time I felt almost awe at the thought of the dangerous nationality
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 41).
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      This complex of images is distilled to metaphors of language and particularly of accent and diction, and it is on these grounds that the successive contests with Valmore are fought.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In their first encounter, conversation can only begin once Ker-Orr establishes English as their mutual language. Valmore’s initial “‘Il fait beau ce soir!’” is met with “‘not at all,’” and it is not until Valmore, in ironic pastiche of the English obsession with the weather, shifts to “‘Oh! you’re English? It’s a fine day!’” that Ker-Orr can agree and their eyes can meet, “doubtfully.” But as soon as Valmore lapses into a New York accent the relationship changes. The movement from the perception that he is talking as an Englishman to a Frenchman, to the realization that he is in fact talking to some form of American, constitutes what Ker-Orr calls a change in “our relative positions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 22). Now the eyes that watch Ker-Orr do so “coldly, judicially, fixedly”; these are “facetted eyes—the eyes of the forty-eight States of the Union” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 24). And from this point the horror story is made real, the satire exposed as fear, as Valmore becomes cyborg in his nature, “dead and inactive . . . a phantom of his former self . . . a ghost” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 35). This story of the “virgin source of a racial hatred” is staged not between the old protagonists of Britain and Europe, but with an entirely new locus of power and energy (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20). And the overriding fear is of suppression. Ker-Orr imagines Valmore as the colonizing force, the usurper, and himself as the “Redskin,” the indigenous population soon to be dispossessed. Kerr-Orr uses “Sioux-like, Blackfeet-like manoeuvres,” revealing a metaphorical tomahawk that is pretechnological in its naivety. In contrast, behind Valmore’s humor is a capitalist gun threatening Ker-Orr with a replay of extinction, the way “the american citizen . . . had at length overcome the Sioux and Cherokee” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 27). What this strange interplay of birthplace and adopted citizenship, origin and nationality, and language and accent documents is the anxiety associated with the process of cultural, political, and social hegemony we have come to term Americanization.

<p>
	      The humor of this particular soldier is then tinged with dark comedy. Indeed, the first complete version of the story was completed in the midst of physical battle, following Lewis’s attachment as a Second Lieutenant to 224 Siege Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1917.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Under the guidance of Ezra Pound, Lewis made a series of significant revisions to the story as he prepared to t in the Battle of the Messines Ridge, the prelude to his major encounter with war at Passchendaele. He wrote to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pound on June 8 and described, “the desolation of the Bosche concrete dugouts in a wilderness of charred spikes that was formerly a wood . . . dead Germans lying about like bloody waxworks.” In the same letter he asked Pound for the first eight pages of the draft short story left in his possession. “I should probably have time to put that right . . . P.S. Do not print Soldier of Humour until I have made that alteration,” he adds. Between June 14 and July 10, by which time he was hospitalized with trench fever, Lewis’s letters document the receipt of the manuscript from Pound and the final stages of the revisionary process.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Given the confrontation of Anglo-American manners in the story it is provocative, perhaps characteristically so, that the story was then finally published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> in two parts in December 1917 and January 1918. Not only was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> a self-consciously American publication, but following the journal’s move from Chicago to New York in January 1917 and the growing influence of the European avant-garde after Pound’s appointment as Foreign Editor in May 1917, readers had begun to actively complain at its foreignness, particularly as its focus shifted from poetry to fiction.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Lewis’s short story, with its direct confrontation of Anglo-American relations, intrudes out of war and into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> at an important moment in history.
	    </p>
<p>
	      But it is the historical backdrop to the revisions Lewis made to the final version of the story in the summer of 1927 that are most revealing. In the major historical accounts of Anglo-American diplomacy, it is the breakdown of negotiations at that summer’s Geneva naval armament conference that represents the nadir in twentieth-century bilateral relations.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although America’s economic growth and imperialism had posed a series of threats to the British Empire even prior to 1900, through a respectful recognition of each country’s territorial rights and ambitions, a sense of united heritage and language, and, perhaps most keenly, as a result of a united sense that the principal threat to both was from European imperial ambitions, and especially those of Germany, disputes had been largely resolved through compromise and conciliation. But America’s entry into the war in 1917 had altered the terrain, diplomatically and economically. Woodrow Wilson commented privately that, “when the War is over we can force them [Britain and France] to our way of thinking, because by that time they will, among other things, be financially in our hands.” In contrast, in Britain, Lord Northcliffe wrote to a friend in 1917 that “we are down on our knees to the Americans.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The economic consequences of Britain’s victory served to accelerate both the process of relative decline and advancement and the antagonism between the countries throughout the 1920s. Despite Britain’s significant war debt to the U.S., the British Empire still controlled most of the key basic resources, especially oil and rubber, necessary for industrial growth in the U.S. And Britain retained the world’s largest merchant fleet and managed the vast majority of the world’s communication cables.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The U.S. continued to push for free trade and feared exclusion from European markets, a situation exacerbated by increased naval building on both sides. Colonially, on the one hand the U.S. felt Britain had gained significant territory as a result of the First World War, albeit at huge human loss, on the other British politicians feared that Canada was becoming harder to defend geographically and moving intellectually and culturally closer to the U.S.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> But there were other non-economic and non-imperial frustrations. In the U.S.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> there was significant ill feeling directed at Britain and its Empire, particularly from displaced ethnic groups such as the American-Irish population after the suppression of the Easter Rising in 1916. Reciprocally, British society held American war neutrality, commercialism, and its supposed absence of culture with disdain. Yet there was a growing feeling in Britain that American society was dominating British culture. American rags and jazz numbers, previously frowned upon, became increasingly popular. Cocktails became accepted in higher society and chewing gum was advertised in newspapers for the first time; lipstick, rouge, eyebrow and eyelash colorings, white silk stockings, and beauty-parlors all became prominent in British metropolitan centers through the same American advertising.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span> commented on March 18, 1927 that American cinema was effectively taking over British life. The British “go to see American stars” the newspaper stated, to such an extent that, for at least a segment of the British population, a form of colonization is considered complete: “They have been brought up on American publicity. They talk America, think America, and dream America. We have several million people, mostly women, who to all intent and purpose are temporary American citizens.” Echoing the article, Elsie, the housemaid in Winifred Holtby’s <span style="font-style:italic;">South Riding</span>, published two years earlier in 1925, is described as being “like most of her generation and locality,” a trilingual speaker: “She talked B.B.C. English to her employer, Cinema American to her companions, and Yorkshire dialect to old milkmen.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> When many British industries were forced into systems of elaborate import tariffs to protect domestic trade from American exports, the motivation was sociopolitical and not just economic.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The Geneva Naval Conference of 1927 represented the culmination of this antagonism. Called by President Coolidge on February 10, 1927, as Lewis completed the first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span>, the conference and the prepublication revisions of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> effectively ran in tandem. The conference opened on June 20 and relations quickly deteriorated due to the intractability of the negotiating position taken by each side.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> While the U.S. insisted on expanding earlier naval agreements to include a broader class of vessels, Britain remained wedded to the underlying philosophy, if not the actual units of measurement, of the 1898 British Naval Defence Act, specifically that British naval strength should be calculated by reference to the size of her closest potential aggressor.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The resultant impasse triggered the start of a naval arms race, leading in February 1929 to the U.S. securing approval for the Cruiser Construction Bill.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Winston Churchill, fearing war, wrote to Cabinet on July 20, “however foolish and disastrous such a war would be, it is, in fact, the only basis upon which the discussions at Geneva are preceding. We do not wish to put ourselves in the power of the United States.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Austen Chamberlain, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, “thought it not only conceivable but probable that hostilities would break out.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      By the time Lewis wrote the “Foreword” to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> on July 6 and arranged for the final delivery of the manuscript to Chatto &amp; Windus, this private confrontation had become very public. Both sides expressly used the press to represent their own positions, each appealing to the other’s public opinion particularly by focusing on issues of affordability.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> For many years the newspaper industries had capitalized on Anglo-American frustrations to drive circulation growth. Robert Vansittart, Head  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the American Department of Foreign Office from 1924–28, records having been told by the “sub-editor of one of the cheaper [British news]papers [that] he could at any time double his circulation by open hostility to America.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In Britain, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span> covered the event extensively on a daily basis with a special correspondent in Geneva. In the U.S., the editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> was reported to have reminded his own Geneva correspondent, Wythe Williams, that he was reporting a “disarmament conference and not a battlefield.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> This very public standoff remained in the British imagination for many years. In Evelyn Waugh’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Decline and Fall</span>, published in 1928, when Paul Pennyfeather is asked against which country Britain will t the next war, he responds “stoutly” with the reply, “‘the Americans.’”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> America had firmly replaced Germany in British imaginations by 1927.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Lewis arrived in the U.S. toward the end of July, in time to experience the American response to the failure of the conference on August 4. Lewis wrote to Charles Prentice on August 1, from the Hotel Brevoort on Fifth Avenue, with mixed feelings about what he saw in New York: “You can here observe the ‘neo-barbarism’ in full flower. The high buildings are very impressive, especially the later ones, ‘hanging-gardens style.’”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> One of the few works of visual art produced by Lewis in the 1920s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhattan</span> (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>), can be dated to this period. As in the letter to Prentice, Lewis mixes architectural awe with a sense of fear that the rhythmic patterns of history, of cycles of violence, lay buried beneath America’s crowded streets: at the centre of the canvas lies a totemic re sacrificed at the hands of an ominous crowd holding aloft a bloodied triangular instrument.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Upon his return to London, Lewis emphasized the simultaneity of the threat and opportunity of America in “Paleface or ‘Love? What ho! Smelling Strangeness,’” initially published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span> in September 1927. “By key-nation I mean that what the United States are today, the other most ‘advanced’ countries we know, from experience, will become tomorrow. Karl Marx, in his day, told people to watch Industrial England, on the same principle,” he wrote as he envisioned the Old World’s eclipse. By the time Lewis expanded this essay into book form in 1929, the U.S. had become for him a new Roman Empire, the place where “the new Law and the new Norm” are defined by the “<span style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span>.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> America would dominate his thoughts from this point forward in “The Americanisation of Art” , <span style="font-style:italic;">Men Without Art</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">America, I Presume</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">America and Cosmic Man</span> .
	    </p>

	      Lewis’s confrontation of Anglo-American relations in “A Soldier of Humour” can then be mapped on to a broader global political, social, and cultural crisis. But what exactly was this crisis? As many diplomatic documents from the period suggest, war with the U.S. had always been seen as an impossible outcome for Britain. As early as 1909 the Colonial Office Defence Committee had determined that “in view of the remoteness of a war with the United States, and of the extreme difficulty of providing local defences adequate to deal with the formidable scale of attacks they could bring to bear, it has been decided . . . attack by the United States need not be taken into consideration in determining the standard of defences of parts of the Western Atlantic.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The much broader issue was that Britain’s leading role in the world had been usurped. A British government report of November 1928, following on closely from the Kellogg-Briand  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pact of August 1928, entitled “Anglo-American Relations,” made the situation clear. Britain could no longer afford to t the U.S. in so public a fashion:

	      That “impotent confession” had largely been made at Geneva. Economically, it had been true since the U.S. entered the war in 1917. Increasingly during the 1920s, as the British public bought American exports, it also became true at a social level. And aesthetically too, it is perhaps possible to remap Paul Peppis’s influential prewar opposition of British and European imperialism on to postwar Anglo-American relations.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Whereas Lewis’s enemies as he returns from internment in 1926 have been taken to be the English coterie of Bloomsbury and the Sitwells, this genealogy suggests the source of Lewis’s anxiety lies in America.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Indeed, since Lewis’s self-imposed burial, American modernism had started to find its own voice, shedding the influence of European expatriates linked to the New York dada movement. Lewis was acutely aware of America’s attempts to Americanize its art, to get rid of the “tell-tale ecstatically wriggling back-side, [which] remains in the Café du Dôme, Montparnasse” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PF</span>, 116). William Carlos Williams had launched the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Contact</span> in 1920 specifically to develop a native American modernism. Sinclair Lewis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Babbitt</span> , John Dos Passos’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhattan</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Transfer</span> , and Hemingway’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Torrents of Spring</span>  had all been published in the preceding years. The distinct American modernism that Lewis had anticipated since the war edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span>, “when it comes,” as “Mongol, inhuman, optimistic, and very much on the precious side, as opposed to European pathos and solidity,” had arrived.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> So by the time Lewis finally revised “A Soldier of Humour” he faced the possibility that a new cultural center was set to relegate, yet again, his own work to the margins, as an indigenous American modernism increasingly challenged an expatriate Eurocentric modernism located in Berlin, London, and Paris, replicating at an artistic level what was true politically and economically.
	    </p>
<p>
	      What then does this mean for our understanding of Lewis? It has traditionally been the case that the Left has seen Lewis as the quintessential embodiment of a certain type of modernist politics. While this has been theorized by Jameson and popularized by John Carey, we can trace it back to W. H. Auden’s contemporary depiction of Lewis as “That lonely old volcano of the Right” and Orwell’s categorization of Lewis’s and high modernism’s pervasive “<span style="font-style:italic;">pessimism of outlook</span>.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> This continues to persist in recent academic work.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> The central problem with this discourse is that it effectively places Lewis’s entire oeuvre, almost irrespective of historical specificity, in an early modernist literary tradition. Associating Lewis with this tradition may certainly have some validity when we think about him as a prewar Vorticist, but by the 1920s Lewis had swapped <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> first for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tyro</span> and then for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span>, and his own attentions had simultaneously moved away from local imperial rivalries toward a future with America at its center. Indeed, Duchamp had already turned the avant-garde in the same direction, announcing to a journalist in September 1915, three months after his arrival in New York, that he believed “the art of Europe is finished—dead—and that America is the country of the art of the future.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Duchamp’s statement, as he escapes the horror of European war, is the first sign that early modernism, dominated and energized by a Europhilic American expatriate community, was shifting its focus back across the Atlantic. By the late 1920s Lewis had followed in the same direction: Gertrude Stein had replaced F. T. Marinetti as his artistic target; Hemingway’s accented English, the “volapük which probably will be ours tomorrow,” had become the major linguistic threat to the Romance languages of Europe.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Eurocentric, Anglo-American modernism had for Lewis largely lost its ability to engage with the modern world: Ezra Pound had become merely “A Man in Love with the Past.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Siamese Demon</h1>
<p>
	      There is however a twist at the end of Lewis’s story. Having left Bayonne, Ker-Orr continues his journey into Spain, traveling by train through Castille to Galicia. In Pontaisandra, an imaginary town on the Atlantic seaboard, Ker-Orr finds himself inadvertently staying in Valmore’s own hotel, the Burgalésa. He checks out the following morning in fear, and the battle recommences with his “wonderful american enemy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 35). In the story’s final scene, Ker-Orr hires the three authentic Americans to demonstrate to Valmore the nature of his American pretensions. As these four metaphorical soldiers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prepare for battle, as if entrenched ahead of the call for engagement, Morton produces a pack of photographs:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		He insisted on producing a packet of obscene photographs, which he held before him fan-wise, like a hand of cards, some of them upside down. The confused mass of bare legs and arms of the photographs, distorted by this method of holding them, with some highly indecent details occurring here and there, produced the effect of a siamese demon
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 42).
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		This strange image belongs to Lewis’s 1927 vision and not that of 1917. Whilst the photographs are present in the original version of the story, they exist in a less surreal form:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Morton possessed a little seraglio of photographs of ladies that his undecided and catholic fancy had made him indulge in . . . . He had his favourite photograph, of course. It was the least tactful, merely, I am afraid
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 346).
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Here Ker-Orr is judging Morton: the “of course” and the “I am afraid” are close to authorial apology. And the photographs are just one item of several in Morton’s possession, alongside a knife, a revolver, some money, an astrological book, a card-case, a dictionary, and a map. But by 1927 the one object, the fan of photographs, stands in for this whole inventory. The photographs are made to stand as the cultural representation of a particular viewpoint upon the products of American soft power, rendered in the bits and pieces of pornographic culture.
		</p>
<p>
		  Although I can find no visual equivalent in modernism for Lewis’s literary image, we might turn to Jay DeFeo’s photocollage, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blossom</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), to find the closest visual approximation. Completed between 1956 and 1958 as American Beat artists started to introspectively reflect on American power, DeFeo’s image graphically depicts the process by which the body is constructed from pieces rather than being something unified.
		</p>
<p>
		  DeFeo’s female body is constructed as it enters the symbolic order, represented in this case by the imagery of the advertising and pornography industries. In so doing the painting visualizes the process of Lacanian identity creation, namely the hallucinatory process through which the infant, despite initially experiencing the body in a fragmentary state as separate parts or pieces (arms, legs, fingers, and toes), learns to think that the body is both whole and continuous with the self. Lacan calls this originary and fragmentary state the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps morcelé</span>.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> But whereas DeFeo uses this discovery to redefine female identity, as an expanding vortex of energy that builds upon itself, Lewis uses it to show how the Lacanian <span style="font-style:italic;">moi</span> is threatened with break-up when such incompleteness is first discovered. For Lewis’s army, the photographs exert a totemic hold: unlike DeFeo they look rather than create. Blauenfeld grins inanely at them: “‘I know that coon,’ he insisted, pointing to one of the photos. ‘I swear I know that coon.’” Morton kisses one of them and as they threaten to intoxicate his army, Ker-Orr must confiscate them to allow his plan to come off. But they refuse to be silenced, and Ker-Orr too is hypnotized into spreading them out in the same fantastical fashion. Having  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sent his troops into battle, he finds himself suddenly struck by the role-playing nature of his game. As he tries to avoid thinking of the machinery he has set in process, we are reminded that this is indeed a mock, not a real, battle and that all the players are merely actors: “But the stage analogy affected me, in the sense that I became rather conscious of my appearance. I must await my cue, but was sure of my reception. I was the great star that was not expected. I was the unknown quantity” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 42–43). The cards trigger the realization of the performative nature of all identity: its constructedness, the way it too has been inscribed with race, gender, and nationality, and how it merely represents the playing of parts.

</div>
<p>
		  This very contemporary and un-modernist theory is lent support by Lewis’s essay, “The Meaning of the Wild Body,” one of the theoretical essays expanded in 1927 to help explain the concerns of the collected short stories. Although a great deal of criticism has been focused on the second part of this essay, “The Root of the Comic,” with its famous inversion of Henri Bergson’s theory of the comic as “the sensations resulting from the observations of a <span style="font-style:italic;">thing</span> behaving like a person,” significantly less attention has been given to the first part of the essay, subtitled “The Meaning of the Wild Body” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158–160). Lewis starts this part of the essay by arguing that his theory of satire assumes the validity of the Cartesian premise of the separation of mind and body. We laugh, he argues, when we observe the body’s absurdity: its lumpen inappropriateness, its sheer animality. This statement has often been used as a starting point for understanding Lewis’s anti-humanitarianism, with Cartesian dualism remapped as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the opposition of the laughing observer to the wild body, as reason to impulse, and as oligarchy to democracy.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> But if we examine this essay more closely we see that this is only incidental to Lewis’s thesis. He argues that absurdity is “the chasm lying between being and non-being, over which it is impossible for logic to throw any bridge, that, in certain forms of laughter, we leap.” When we approach the absurd “we land plumb in the centre of Nothing.” He goes on to suggest that the best way of experiencing or approaching this absurdity is through the experience of alterity, and particularly in the observation of nationality. Since everyday reality is engrained with preconception and assumption, it is only in the observation of difference that absurdity can be clearly revealed to us: “It is easy for us to see, if we are french, that the German is ‘absurd,’ or if german, that the French is ‘ludicrous,’ for we are <span style="font-style:italic;">outside</span> in that case” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 157–58). Observing national habits such as these—or the religious practices of the Jew or the class-based habits of the Oxbridge educated—serves as a mechanism for crystalizing the ontological chasm into materiality, which is rather similar to the point of textual contradiction in deconstruction theory. When familiarity has been removed we can begin to see the absurdity, or rather the extent to which being and behavior are functions of both culture and nature.
		</p>
<p>
		  Looked at from this perspective, Lewis appears dangerously close to articulating a theory of individual practice that relies, at least politically, on behaviorism’s arsenal of habits and learned gestures. Of course, Lewis’s antagonistic stance to behaviorism is apparent in his own work and has been well documented in academic studies.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> In order to resolve this inconsistency, criticism has tended to assume that Lewis was simply bifurcating the world into those masses for whom the laws of behaviorism were all too painfully true and those few decision-makers capable of an intellectual life.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Instead, I believe it is suggestive to consider Lewis’s essay in the terms laid out by Marcel Mauss in a 1934 lecture at a meeting of the Société de Psychologie. Mauss’s interest lay, as with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span> article of 1927, in understanding how cinema was translating American manners on to European bodies: “American walking fashions had begun to arrive over here [Paris], thanks to the cinema.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> This formed the basis for his theory on “techniques of the body,” the idea that every physical action carries the imprint of learning. For Mauss this acts philosophically as a means of escaping the circularity of Cartesianism or, in Lewis’s terms, as an attempt to re-establish logic in the gap between being and non-being. In the 1920s and early 1930s then both Lewis and Mauss found that the idea of a complete homogenous body, owned and controled by the subject, was under attack by historical process.
		</p>
<p>
		  Instead of advancing an early modernist attack on democracy, Lewis’s essay attempts to advance an alternative theory of behavior at a time of enormous sociohistorical change. He turns this theory inward rather than use it as a weapon to attack his enemies:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Again, it is comparatively easy to see that another man, as an animal, is absurd; but it is far more difficult to observe oneself in that hard and exquisite light. But no man has ever continued to live who has observed himself in that manner for longer than a flash. Such  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> consciousness must be of the nature of a thunderbolt. Laughter is only summer lightning. But it occasionally takes on the dangerous form of absolute revelation
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158).
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    In part this observation probably stems from the stern self-examination that Lewis had placed himself under during the internment of the 1920s. It is certainly keenly evident in the self-reflexive properties of a painting such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro</span> (1920–21), where it is not so much that the sneer is a function of intellectual arrogance, but rather that the sitter is so self-consciously unpicked by his own posture and attitude, a situation made metaphoric in color by the sheer inappropriateness of the glaring yellow background. And as the 1920s progressed, while Lewis wrote extensively about the public world, his attentions had turned significantly inward to the theorization of the self, and the “not-self,” helped by his readings in non-Western traditions.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Lewis’s point is that to observe the self as absurd is to reveal two distinct truths. First, it reveals an inherent split in the nature of subjectivity: the absurdity of the German is ultimately also the absurdity of self. And second, it reveals the irreconcilable necessity of postulating a point of objectivity from which it can be observed that being is neither wholly objective nor wholly subjective: “We are not constructed to be <span style="font-style:italic;">absolute observers</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158). The thesis must collapse under its own demands. And at this point, as the futility of the project of reason is revealed, laughter becomes so dark that it threatens life itself, forcing the ego’s involvement with a fundamental process of break-up.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Lewis is forced therefore to protect his ego from the very revelation his story documents, and he has Valmore discover his own inauthenticity through a sadomasochistic homosexual performance. As the story closes, Valmore is enticed into a state of sexual excitement by his meeting with the three authentic Americans, “his old pop-eyes beginning to stick out of his old head, and his old mouth watering.” Morton is seen “on all fours . . . tickling his legs.” And by the time Ker-Orr finally arrives, having freed himself from the siamese demon, Valmore is in metaphoric chains, sexually cuffed as he turns “a pair of solemn, appealing, outraged dog’s-eyes” upon his eroticized master Taffany. Ker-Orr finally reveals the nature of his plan, and incensed by it, Valmore turns his eyes to Morton as if asking, “Would not his master repulse and chastise this insolence?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 44). In effect, Lewis transforms Valmore’s Americanization into a symbol of the European decay he so despised, and equates it with homosexuality. Such “male-inversion” stood for Lewis as the most obvious symptom of social collapse, and it linked in his mind to images of bodily strength, by the absence or presence of vitality or substance, what he calls “starch” in the body. Homosexuality for Lewis was a form of corporeal relapse, males becoming “what in Sodom are technically called ‘bitches’, in a process of almost physiological transformation” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PF</span>, 156). Accordingly, Ker-Orr’s victory is conceived as the imposition of such a transformation on his enemy Valmore, returning him to the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps morcelé</span>:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      My enemy pulled himself together as though the different parts of his body all wanted to leap away in different directions, and he found it all he could do to prevent such disintegration. An attempt at a bow appeared as a chaotic movement, the various parts of his body could not come together for it. . . . An extraordinary confusion beset his body
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 45).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			But this cannot disguise Lewis’s awareness of the pyrrhic nature of his victory. In revealing to Valmore that he is only a Frenchman from the Midi, it also reveals to Ker-Orr, and Lewis, the fabricated nature of identity. Lewis is in effect dismantled by his own work. What Ker-Orr encounters in his first meeting with Valmore in the hall of glass that makes up the “‘<span style="font-style:italic;">Fonda del Mundo</span>’” is ultimately a reflection of the self. Valmore’s mock-Americanisms are at once both wish-fulfillment for a new modernity and a revelation of the interplay between the objective and subjective elements involved in identity creation. The battles with Valmore, based around an investigation of alterity and a revelation of the tectonic changes in international economic relations, serve to reveal that the image of a whole body is merely armor. Britain’s role as the supreme center of politics, economics, and culture was ending in the late 1920s. A new American form of civilization, of which the supreme expression would be the era we now term postmodernism, would replace it.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> This process of dismantling, as Lewis described in “The Meaning of the Wild Body,” is like a “thunderbolt”: it is the horrifying discovery of the Lacanian Real, the fragmentary body that precedes the ruse of identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158). Rather than an early modernist aesthetics, it is nothing short of a postcolonial poetics, expressed as Britain became both a postimperial and late capitalist society. Indeed, this body, strangely in common with the idea of the colonial body encountered in much postcolonial literature, is fragmented, disordered, and displaced.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The fear of this rank and file soldier of humor, in an ironic reversal of terms, is then the fear of literal and metaphorical subalternity.

In 1922, William Carlos Williams was claiming <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span>, despite its publication of many European modernists, as an American organ: “‘I hope I may be permitted to say that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Review</span> is American . . . because it maintains contact with common sense in America.’” Quoted in Mark Morrisson, “Nationalism and the modern American Canon,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cambridge Companion to American Modernism</span>, Walter B. Kalaidjian, ed. (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 21.

			Compromise had already been made by Britain on this issue. The two-navy standard requirement for the British navy (that is to be as big as the next two largest navies combined) was lowered to a 60% requirement in 1910, and again to 0% (a one-navy standard) in June 1921.

			  As Jameson discusses at length in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cultural Turn</span>, postmodernism, by definition, is essentially an American historical and cultural phenomenon. However, those works that have chosen to look for a British alternative to postmodernism have tended to theorize in terms of Britain’s social, economic, and political decline, rather than the rise of the U.S. See Hugh Kenner, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Sinking Island: The Modern English Writers</span> (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1987) and Joshua Esty, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Shrinking Island: Modernism and National Culture in England</span> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004).

			  For example, Ralph Singh, in V. S.

S. Naipaul, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mimic Men</span> (London: Picador, 2002), 27.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
