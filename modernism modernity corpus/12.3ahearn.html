<p class="noIndent">
At the height of T. S. Eliot's prominence, a young Hugh Kenner published "Eliot's Moral Dialectic" .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  A now surprising note to the essay describes it as "a chapter from a comprehensive study of T. S. Eliot being prepared in collaboration with Herbert Marshall McLuhan" ("EMD,"421). Kenner's second book would not have been about Ezra Pound, but about Eliot, and it would have been co-authored. In 1949 Kenner was moving toward the main current of literary and academic research, after having gotten Chesterton out of his system. Yet the Eliot study was delayed for ten years, and McLuhan disappeared from the project. In the interim, Kenner had stumbled across Ezra Pound. Kenner perceived that Pound, not Eliot, was the master poet of the age. Kenner's considerations of Eliot and Pound indicate that the revaluation turns on his conception of the nature of language as closely allied to Christian theology.
</p>

<p>
In "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Eliot's career involves an "intense concern with moral states" that has escaped most previous critics, who are ill-equipped to elucidate "spiritual themes" ("EMD,"421, 422). For Kenner, only a critic steeped in Christian belief can successfully approach Eliot, if only because "The still point around which the poetry of Eliot revolves is the point at which theology and poetry meet" ("EMD," 433). Eliot is not concerned with hinting at his personal life, or illustrating his views on contemporary events, or prescribing remedies for an ailing culture. No, this Eliot is centrally preoccupied with dramatizing 

<b></b>

internal, spiritual states. Eliot's career after <i>The Waste Land</i> as the most influential poet and critic of his age proves incidental to this central, spiritual concern. Furthermore, since Kenner finds few critics able to discern the nature of the spiritual states, the acclaim Eliot has received must be founded on what readers <i>want</i> to see in Eliot, not on what is there. "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," for example, whatever it means to Eliot, is a generic haunted temple that echoes in refined form the yearnings and aversions of individual readers. They perceive merely a specter of their own desires. Although Eliot was not attempting to construct verbal artifacts that would appeal to a large audience and ensure his presence in anthologies, his language had just that effect. Hence Eliot's advantage over Pound in the marketplace.
</p>

<p>
For Kenner, the proper reader of Eliot understands how language and human nature can be understood metaphysically. Only those critics steeped in metaphysics and theology can comprehend the true Eliot. Kenner's conception of metaphysics and theology as they relate to poetry&#x02014;both Eliot's and Pound's&#x02014;helps explain why Kenner was first taken with Eliot, and why he so quickly turned to Pound. In "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Kenner points to a theologically grounded theory of language. He credits Walter J. Ong's essay, "Wit and Mystery: A Revelation in Mediaeval Latin Hymnody," with providing insight about Eliot's poetry, particularly with regard to Aquinas's claim that poets and Christian theologians both have recourse to metaphor.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Following Ong's lead, Kenner addresses the common "reliance on metaphor" of theology and poetry "for the opposite reasons that the latter deals in materials too much immersed in matter for immediate apprehension (such as the human will), the former in objects too much transcending material realization (such as the Trinity)" ("EMD," 433).
</p>

<p>
In Ong's view, and Kenner's, this understanding of metaphor illuminates mediaeval wit poetry, the Metaphysical poets, and Eliot's poems. Aquinas insists on a profound rift between God and language. Hence the recourse to metaphor, language's inherently lame attempt to deal with the mysteries underlying Christian belief, including the Trinity. For the young Kenner, Eliot's poetry fundamentally attempts to make twentieth-century metaphors that will, in Thomistic fashion, come as close as possible to the central Christian mysteries. As "Eliot's Moral Dialectic" remarks of <i>Little Gidding,</i> "Through the manipulation of parody-reconciliations of varying degrees of imperfection, an illusion, a speculum, of the inapprehensible transcendent reconciliation, the 'still point,' is forged for contemplation" ("EMD," 433). At the bottom of the Eliotic well lies a spiritual radiance.
</p>

<p>
Even in 1949, however, the Thomistic assessment of language's inherent shortcomings made Kenner uneasy. In <i>Paradox in Chesterton,</i> Kenner records Chesterton's allegiance to a Thomistic view of language.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet Kenner also apparently yearns after a theory of language that will not leave human beings eternally juggling metaphors and speaking paradoxically. Kenner apologizes for Chesterton's muddled prose, but emphasizes that the perception behind the prose is accurate: "What must be praised in Chesterton is not the writing but the seeing" (<i>PC,</i> 103). At another point he cites Jeremy Taylor on creation as mirroring God (<i>PC,</i> 123). Although Kenner honors Chesterton by taking seriously his allegiance to Thomistic doctrine, he also raises the 

<b></b>

possibility that perception can acquire sound knowledge of ultimate truths. But can clear perceptions be translated into linguistic clarity?
</p>

<p>
A passage halfway through <i>Dublin's Joyce</i>  encapsulates Kenner's view of Western intellectual history, and touches on the question of language's adequacy:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . from Plato's <i>Cratylus</i> till the Cartesian revolution language was seen as simultaneously linking and harmonizing all the intellectual and physical functions of men with the order of the universe. By the Neo-Platonists and Augustine, by Bonaventure and Francis Bacon, the world was viewed as a book, the lost language of which was analogous to human speech.

<p>
This tradition expressing confidence in language's intimate, ongoing relation to the whole universe antedates Descartes's interference. As we learn in <i>The Poetry of Ezra Pound</i> , "Descartes' distrust of language . . . has introduced into . . . communication a vehement determination to effect between poet and audience a transfusion of personality rather than perception" (<i>PEP,</i> 72). Once Descartes assigns priority to the individual's mind rather than to the created world which it inhabits, certainty is limited to one's own thoughts. Therefore, what we can communicate with assurance is simply those thoughts and their characteristic arrangement: in a word, our personality. The modernist revolution, however, counters the cult of personality. In 1952, Kenner sees Eliot's and Pound's poetry as offering perceptions, not personality. But what conception of language allows modernism to rectify the Cartesian error?
</p>

<p>
Pre-Cartesian theories of language include a rival to the Thomistic doctrine, a Franciscan tradition, whose chief re is named in the passage from <i>Dublin's Joyce:</i> Saint Bonaventure (born 1221), a contemporary of Aquinas (born ca. 1225). As a Franciscan, Bonaventure approved a view of the world and its constituents&#x02014;including language&#x02014;that denies the Thomistic fundamental rift between the divine and the divinely created. This view stresses the <i>link</i> between God and His creation, like "a ray of light entering through a window . . . colored by different ways according to the different colors of the various parts."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  For the Franciscans, God permeates the universe and permits humanity to see and celebrate His presence. Bonaventure clearly implies a theory of language mediating between the soul and God in his <i>Itinerarium mentis in Deum (The Soul's Journey into God)</i> . In the third chapter, he lists forms of understanding by which intellects can communicate with one another about the Truth, among which are grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the Trivium), all inseparable from language. He affirms that God has bequeathed humanity the gift of language, enabling us to perceive Him without hindrance.
</p>

<p>
In choosing between Eliot and Pound, Kenner turned to an enabling fiction about language that resembles the Franciscan model. Through language the gifted poet reveals "an intrinsic relation between palpable linguistic gestures and human tensions and actions" (<i>PEP,</i> 258). This proposition simply says that Pound's poems are faithful records of human concerns. Kenner makes no claim that something more is revealed, but invites us to consider that it might be. Following his chapter on "Seeing" in <i>The Poetry of Ezra Pound,</i> Kenner mentions "metaphysical implications which we have not space to go into" (<i>PEP,</i> 87). One plausible implication is that Pound's verse, and 

<b></b>

the best modernist writing, is based on a perception that language can reveal truth about the universe, because the universe, language, and humankind evolve from a divine dispensation.
</p>

<p>
His continuing considerations of Eliot indicate that Kenner has a transcendent theological implication in mind. As we have seen in "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Kenner perceives Eliot as a Christian poet centrally preoccupied with dramatizing spiritual states. By 1954, when Kenner reviewed <i>The Cocktail Party</i> and <i>The Confidential Clerk,</i> the core of Eliot's concern no longer looked so Christian. Kenner noticed that "Mr. Eliot's characteristic poetry" suggests "language autonomously discovering within itself potentialities of suggestion of which it is commonly unaware."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The "potentialities" may be Christian, or just religious, but Kenner does not insist on this point. By far the most interesting discussion striking a new note about Eliot comes shortly after <i>The Invisible Poet,</i> whenKenner reviews Eliot's last play, <i>The Elder Statesman.</i> Startlingly, Kenner sees the play as reflecting the circumstances of Eliot's life.
</p>

<p>
He identifies the "tension of <i>The Elder Statesman . . .</i> in the very idea of human privacy, . . . a tension between" a privacy "which withholds itself behind a r&#x000F4;le and one day withers into a ghost . . . and the blessed sort which can give itself into communion with another person precisely because it <i>is</i> a privacy, . . . and not an interfering determination to make its existence felt."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In 1949 the tension informing Eliot's verse for Kenner was a struggle between language and unnamable (except as paradox or metaphor) spiritual truth. Now the struggle is between one mode of the individual and another. Kenner calls the play the "most intimate of his works," pointing to "the lyric dedication . . . to his wife" ("FOV," 40). By implication, Eliot's late marriage has at least partly freed him from the danger of living only in a role, only as a prepared face. Eliot has achieved in the play something wiser and more precious than he had in his poems, which "he conceives in some psychic center where the obscure phatic sensations of his own voice take their origin" ("FOV," 36). Eliot as poet is fundamentally unattached to other people, but Eliot as dramatist eventually liberates himself from the closed world of his poems. He achieves an aesthetic form that frees him from Bradleyan incarceration, "set free from the lyric flame by writing for other voices, not knowing whose voices they will be" ("FOV," 40). Unlocking Eliot's major verse is not consideration of Christian paradox but awareness of incoherent private sensations. The "blessed" communion with another continues the Franciscan tinge to Kenner's thought. To be isolated in one's self is to be removed from others, creation at large, and God. The movement outward from one's self towards others constitutes salvation, or the potential to be saved, with language as a vehicle that can take us outside ourselves. For Kenner, this was a truth Pound knew early, and which Eliot learned late.
</p>

<p>
A quasi-Franciscan conception of language is in keeping with Kenner's critical method. Language as a vehicle that can carry the self away from immurement in privacy can also save ossified forms of thought. The key modernists for Kenner are artists possessing a keen sense of how language&#x02014;prose or verse&#x02014;in the nineteenth century became a self-contained field, a well-regulated, seemingly comprehensive discourse that had drifted away from the real. Hence Kenner celebrates Joyce for focusing "on 

<b></b>

what was actually there" (<i>DJ,</i> 11). Language proves itself by adhering to the larger, more complex mode of being called the "real." Kenner cites Pound's praise of Dante's "precision," which "comes from the attempt to reproduce exactly the thing which has been clearly seen" (<i>PEP,</i> 59). The "thing" may be an object, a person, a value, an idea, or a style. But without a conception of language as an instrument adequate to handle all these "things," the empirical ability to discern them is pointless. The flexibility, breadth, potential, and saving grace Kenner attributes to language point, if not obviously to a divine creator, to something one might just as well call divinity.
