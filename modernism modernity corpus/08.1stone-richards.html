"The very existence of psychoanalysis," John Forrester has observed,
"is a permanent testimony to the failure of communication."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 It is a comment which might remind us how keenly the Surrealists
 sensed that the psychopathology of cognitive failure (the aphasias,
 the psychoses, as well as the psychoneuroses) could provide models
 for alternative patterns of attention and communication. Indeed, any
 adequate appreciation of Surrealist automatism must begin with just
 this sense of the new possibilities offered by alternative forms of
 attention, promising access to different perspectives of experience
 and world-projection. For

<B></B>

Artaud, Bataille, Breton, and others, appreciating that the ontological
possibilities inherent in the psychopathology of failure could be
the precondition for certain forms of creativity was grounded in an
awareness of the key role that dialogue plays in psychiatric discourse,
whether in the recent field of trauma studies ushered in by the Great
War or the older case studies of patients such as Charcot's Augustine
X.L. or Blanche Wittman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 For Breton and Artaud, in particular, the question of dialogue was linked
 to a movement of disorientation that always posed the question of the
 imago as a means of confronting the imbrication of time and sense. As
 Monique Borie expressed it of Artaud, "Going beyond the question of
 meaning's closure, Artaud is always concerned with the question of
 communication."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Dialogue, in other words, did not necessarily lead to communication, as
 one can easily see in the poignant examples of non-communication between
 doctor and patient which are represented in Charcot's <I>Iconographie
 photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Throughout the existence of the Surrealist movement, forms of dialogue
 will provide privileged sites for the exploration of this question,
 especially in its dimensions of negativity, movement, and the
 <I>informe</I> (formlessness).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nowhere is this question of non-communication and dialogue better
manifested than in Breton's famous narrative <I>Nadja</I>, and in
particular in the discussion surrounding the various drawings which
Nadja gives to Breton. On the one hand, there is the work which Breton
titles <I>A True Shield of Achilles</I>, a drawing charged with archaic
imagery (the devil, a siren, serpents) of a sort typical of psychosis,
a sort in which the temporality of the preconscious collapses into the
<I>Zeitlos</I>/anachronism of the unconscious and so turns place (in this
case, the place of the drawing itself) into a functional imbrication of
different temporalities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, there are Nadja's final sketches, making up a work
 which, unlike the other drawings by her which are all reproduced in
 photographs, is known only through Breton's verbal account of it:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In these, on a table, in front of an open book, a cigarette lying on an
ashtray and insidiously releasing a serpent of smoke, a globe cut open
to hold lilies, between the hands of a beautiful woman--everything
was arranged to permit the descent of what she called <I>the human
reflector</I>, kept off by forceps, and which she said was "the best of
all." [<I>N</I>, 130/155-57]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this work, the "globe cut open" suggests a complete identification
between desire and the ideal in a manner typical of the megalomania of
psychosis: the psychotic who thinks he is God the Father, the Son of
God, Mary, a saint, or Napoleon. Here, however, the telling point is
not megalomania's violence, buts its projection onto the entire world
("a globe" or "mappemonde") and its response to the power of someone
("the human reflector") who is "'the best of all.'" Tellingly, Breton's
account of the final drawing is followed by blank space occupying about
a line, then a prolonged ellipse of dots that stretch across the page,
then another blank space. No other section of the narrative is followed
by such a notable silence, one which registers Breton's growing awareness
of, and his inability to avoid, the brutal fact of Nadja's borderline
condition. Moreover, this account is carefully separated from the
discussion which treats the

<B></B>

main body of Nadja's drawings, and also from the virulent denunciation of
psychiatry which follows. And if this textual silence signals a rueful
recognition of Nadja's state--and note how the presence of mourning is
secured by the absence of its object, the drawing itself, which is not
reproduced--then it will come as no surprise to find a mirror image, as it
were, of the same dynamics at work in the siting of the next drawing by
Nadja. That work, a drawing titled <I>The Soul of the Wheat</I> and the
last by her to be reproduced in the book, has been carefully separated
from all her others and inserted into the section denouncing psychiatry,
where it immediately follows the photograph of Professor Claude, epitome
of the psychiatric profession's blindness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Placed here, the drawing's presence becomes a mournful mark of Nadja's
 absence, her disappearance into the sanatorium, even as it simultaneously
 reminds us of the archaic imagery of <I>The True Shield of Achilles</I>,
 particularly in its understated evocation of the grain associated with
 Demeter, and acknowledges such imagery's threatened status by means
 of the scythe sweeping toward the wheat. Abundance and plentifulness
 (wheat, Demeter) are juxtaposed against death and mourning (the scythe),
 a movement also recapitulated in other drawings and even in Breton's
 and Nadja's wanderings through the city. "Pink is better than black,
 but the two harmonize" ("s'accordent"), says Nadja in a maxim which
 Breton later recalls (<I>N</I>, 116/138), as if suggesting that such
 discordances might be harmonized or gathered into some reciprocity,
 in much the same way that Breton and Nadja's different personalities
 might potentially complement each other. But over the course of
 <I>Nadja</I>, what begins as a suggestion of mutual reciprocity,
 epitomized in the glances that Breton and Nadja exchange at their
 first meeting, modulates into projective identification and thence
 into a form of intra-subjectivity--the lack of relation to something
 beyond one's individual consciousness--which bypasses and yet encloses
 Breton. It is this movement of failed relationality that I should like
 to explore in this essay, doing so by considering the role that silence
 plays in Breton's <I>construction</I> of <I>Nadja</I>, which is to say,
 in how he elaborates his relation to the temporality of his encounter
 with Nadja. Construction, here, is used in the sense intended by Freud
 when he wrote that the task of the analyst is "to make out what has been
 forgotten from the traces which it has left behind, or, more correctly,
 to <I>construct</I> it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Breton senses the psychotic dimensions of Nadja's drawing of the
globe, he responds with silence and effectively acknowledges the call
of what he has earlier called "our very instinct of self-preservation"
(<I>N</I>, 20/21). His response is to narrate--"the desire to tell
<I>you</I>," as he later says to X (<I>N</I>,156/184). But to respond
to the kind of narrating that will be <I>Nadja</I>, we must consider
the nature of his silence and its relation to Nadja's final drawing of
"a globe cut open to hold lilies."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Few topics in Breton's thinking are as difficult of treatment as
that of silence. Certainly, in the tacit importance of silence in
his <I>oeuvre</I>, Breton, who in his early days had been a disciple
of Val&eacute;ry, is part and parcel of that high European modernism,
beginning with Symbolism, in which silence is accorded a critical role
in the experience of thought and registers deepening doubts about the
limits of discursivity. But behind Val&eacute;ry's fascination with
silence was another aspect of his thought which Eliot later noted, one
that also fascinated Breton. As Breton later recalled: "But perhaps the

<B></B>

most piquante aspect of his [Val&eacute;ry's] conversation was when his
'profoundly destructive, even nihilistic mind,' which so rightly impressed
T. S. Eliot, showed through."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 It was because of a similar nihilist spirit that Breton's conception of
 silence, however strongly shaped by Symbolism, never formed part of a
 broader mysticism<I>.</I> Whence his attempt, in 1936, to distinguish
 the Surrealist marvelous (<I>merveilleux</I>) from Symbolist mystery
 (<I>myst&egrave;re</I>), while still recognizing that both had common
 roots in a historical moment when "the bridge of communication between
 humans has been broken."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The effort of communication between Breton and Nadja, an effort that is
prolonged into the construction of the narrative <I>Nadja</I>, teems
with silences: they function as bridges, openings, and reciprocities,
and at times they signal the recognition of limits or an admission of
failure. As an effort of interpretation, of construction, the narrative
<I>Nadja</I> inevitably contains such reflections, however tacit, on
what both connects and disconnects, on the formality or measure of the
experience that is the narrative. The many intervals, which are marks
of difference and a staging of distance, which occur between the events
that take place in the story and their construction within the narrative,
signal an alternative mode of attention at work, one discernible from
the moment that the work comes embedded with marks of silence, that
long pause which follows Nadja's mention of "<I>the human reflector</I>
. . . 'the best of all.'"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such silence allows for no movement other than that of circularity. But
while Nadja's final drawing leaves Breton no choice but to recognize and
acknowledge the demented nature of her experience, the ensuing silence
also gathers up and returns to what has been tacitly present from the
book's famous opening sentence, "Qui suis-je?" (which can mean either "Who
am I?" or "Whom am I following?"). The caesura following this ambiguous
interrogative is momentous: it recapitulates the devastating dividedness
of the experience which Breton's and Nadja's wanderings have produced,
in much the same way as the sentence itself allows the speaker to relive
the same fragmentation, an experience that is proleptic of the narrative
experience to come. The ambiguous interrogative opens a movement of
doubling from which the narrative construction never deviates, one that
discloses a crucial aspect of silence: the doubling that is heralded by
the opening interrogation is both temporal ("Whom am I following?") and
nontemporal ("Who am I?"). But in refusing the non-temporality of
anteriority, as the image of the <I>fant&ocirc;me</I> would seem to
imply to him, in favor of a temporality of <I>temps v&eacute;cu</I>,
Breton leaves the construction open to a double temporality and its
attendant resonances and disturbances, particularly where such temporality
encounters silence in the texture of the feminine, or the feminine in
its absence as trace.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Silence, in other words, is one of the means by which embodiment
in its prepredicative modality is lived in Nadja and in Surrealist
experience. The inscription of silence is not possible apart from the
body, which serves as a perceptual mechanism linked to the unconscious
in much the same way as Freud describes experience being inscribed on the
unconscious through the image of a note pad which retains the impression
of writing from the previous leaves which have since vanished.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 When the <I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> of depth, or the timelessness
 of the unconscious, encounters a lived and transred instant,
 unconscious memory takes the subject into the depth

<B></B>

and disperses, as it were, the surface writing, as mute experience seeks
its articulation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Silence may well be a precondition for that articulation, but it can
 also pose a threat to it. As Rousseau, whose statue adorns the square
 from which Breton sets out on his journey, understood, silence can be
 an innocent medium for intimacies beyond language, and hence beyond
 corruption; but it can also become a mark of absolute separation--not
 silence as transparence and finely modulated lyric moments, but silence
 become obstacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 When silence as obstacle is articulated with memory, as occurs at
 the moment Breton recalls Nadja's drawings, it raises questions about
 silence's metaphorical or symbolic value. What does silence symbolize? In
 their disagreement about the phylogenetic aspect of symbolism, Freud
 and Jung came to crystallize their differences around two issues:
 the status of the maternal, and silence. Jung wished to abandon the
 Oedipus complex and place in its stead the re of the eternal mother,
 but at the price of lacking any worthy account of temporality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Yet his attitude toward silence is a challenge to which Freud never
 adequately responded, for Jung's challenge merely served to consolidate
 Freud's mistrust of any attempt to diminish the role of language in
 shaping the distinctiveness of psychoanalysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 John Forrester conveys the dispute thus: "What the conflict amounted to
 was the fundamental difference of attitude towards the ineffable. Freud,
 in absorbing the ineffable into the inexpressible, and in his verbal
 rationalism, distrusted the symbol insofar as it became pure Image,
 and was detached from the Word."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 For Jung silence could open into the archaic and the maternal, while
 for Freud it was simply a mark of resistance in the transference--and
 thereby "the danger of proximity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 For both, however, and inescapably so, it signalled a failure of
 symbolization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Breton disavowed the high Symbolist mysticism of silence, his
thinking, from the inception of automatism, repeatedly returned to the
phenomenology of silence. In approaching the conception of silence at work
in the construction of <I>Nadja</I>, we shall see that it takes us back
into the heart of the book, into its interior as an act of unfolding,
a slow circular opening out that is perhaps the characteristic movement
of Breton's writing in <I>Nadja</I>, one which leaves the narrator
caught in flux and parallel meanings. It is an unfolding movement
that also contains a form of layering, the topology of which is very
close to Freud's image of the writing-pad. (This unfolding movement
finds its reflex in Breton's habitual recourse to words with floral
connotations.) Such unfolding lets the narrative explore the relation
between silence as resistence and silence to the maternal. Failures of
symbolization, the silences that punctuate <I>Nadja</I>, are not simply
the outcome of an attempt to manipulate skilfully the reader's feelings;
they are indices of Breton's condition in the act of constructing the
work, and they testify to the faltering in Breton's desire for the human
being who was Nadja, a failure of emotional investment or cathexis. As
Monique Schneider argues, "In that sense, we could consider trauma as
a 'failure of inscription,' a failure inseparable from another sort
of incapacity: incapacity to invest oneself in what arrives, with the
result that the only possible form of investment is concentrated into a
reaction of refusal" (<I>Pdl'O</I>, 93). The construction of the narrative
<I>Nadja</I> thus becomes an attempt to manage this failure of desire
and its various intervals--of silence, temporalities, and understanding--

<B></B>

through new strategies of cathexis that require repetition: for Breton
to tell the <I>story</I>, first to "himself" and then ostensibly to X,
is to acknowledge and, from his and Nadja's viewpoint, to relive "the
irreparable disaster sweeping away a part of herself . . . the disaster
of which that day [first] gave me a notion . . ." (<I>N</I>, 114/135).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The disaster which Breton first divines on that day, Sunday, 10
October, 1926, is tacitly signalled through a particular form of the
counter-transference: boredom. Though boredom can be thought of as
dissolving the psychic processes responsible for the presence of form
preparatory to the giving on to exteriority, it nevertheless remains
compatible with fascination and even the possibility of participation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Something of this is discernible when Breton recounts his relationship
 of participation with Nadja, which never allows him to be separate,
 untouched, or unaffected by "the irreparable disaster." When on
 Wednesday, 6 October, Nadja opens her copy of Breton's most recent book,
 <I>The Lost Steps</I>, she turns to the essay "The New Spirit," which
 tersely records Breton's enigmatic encounters with a charming woman
 whom he subsequently pursues but cannot locate. Nadja has read it and
 "is astonished and disappointed by the fact that I had considered
 commentaries on the account of the day's brief occurrences quite
 superfluous" (<I>N</I>, 78/89-90). She presses Breton for an
 explanation and an indication "about the degree of objectivity which I
 attribute to it" (<I>N</I>, 78/90). His response, reported as indirect
 speech, bears upon the construction of <I>Nadja</I> and his relation
 to Nadja:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I am obliged to reply that I know nothing about it, that in such matters
the right to bear witness seems to me to be all that is granted, that I
have been the first victim of this abuse of confidence, if that is what
it is, but I can see that she is not going to let me off, I read first
impatience, then consternation in her eyes. Perhaps she imagines I am
lying: a certain discomfiture persists between us. [<I>N</I>, 78/90;
translation modified]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a pivotal instant in the tacit articulation of silences and
temporalities: the means of bearing witness ("de constater") make
Breton's position of observation into a double one, in which he is both
the reporter of an event and "the first victim" of his own report. But
Nadja's questions touch on the possibility that this observing double
is simply fictional, raising the spectre of deception. Her bodily
impatience and consternation register the possibility of distance,
while a perceptible tension between the two ("a certain discomfiture")
registers another multiplicity in silence. True, that tension may seem
to be dissipated or resolved by the ensuing first kiss, which follows
shortly. But Nadja's consternation isn't sexual; it concerns Breton's
attitude toward "the lack of results of this pursuit" (<I>N</I>, 78/89),
<I>pursuit</I> referring to both the woman and the essay that recounts his
failure to find her again. It indicates the distinct temporalities that
stand between her and Breton: he has the capacity to turn events into
discourse and can be a subject in both realms, versus her suspicion of
this fruitless pursuit, a discrepancy that anticipates their different
fates by the book's end. Her consternation also recalls the earlier
moment, on Tuesday, 5 October, when Nadja first receives copies of the
"Manifesto of Surrealism" and <I>The Lost Steps</I> and we see the first
tacit signs of boredom:

<I>October 5.</I> --Nadja is here first, ahead of time. She no longer
looks the way she did yesterday. Rather elegant today, in black and
red, with an extremely pretty hat which she takes off, revealing
her straw-colored hair which has lost its incredible disorder, silk
stockings and shoes which, unlike yesterday's, are quite presentable. The
conversation has also come more difficult and starts on her part with
a number of hesitations. [<I>N</I>, 72/83]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This barely passable elegance contrasts sharply with Breton's first
glimpse of her, when she is a person charged with "that look which is hers
alone" (<I>N</I>, 72/82; translation modified). The later consternation
of Nadja's body amplifies this earlier discomfiture and hints at her
suspicion that she may well become a victim of Breton's genius, of what
she terms his "great idea" (<I>N</I>, 70/81). As she surveys the crowds
hurrying homeward, all those people who will not be the actors in the
revolution ("Everyone is hurrying around us . . ."), she says to Breton:
"Hearing you speak, I felt that nothing would hold you back, nothing,
not even me" (<I>N</I>, 70/81). Her remark, as reported by Breton, uses
language remarkably consonant with the voice of "Subject" ("Subjet"),
the reconstructed soliloquy of a shell-shocked soldier which Breton had
published in early 1918:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is a chilling echo that alerts a discerning reader to the dangers
that will eventually engulf Nadja. The monitory note is struck again
when Breton and Nadja meet two days later, on 6 October, with Nadja
"looking as she did the first day I saw her" (<I>N</I>, 77/88), exuding
that "look" which Breton has so highly esteemed. Just before the episode
turns to the occasion of the first kiss, Breton reports: "She seems to
be suffering from a certain inner conflict . . ." ("une certaine lutte
para&icirc;t aussi se poursuivre en elle")(<I>N</I>, 79/92). The passage,
in its rhythm and diction, and in evoking a threshold experience, recalls
that dramatic moment when the audience recognizes that the child in the
play <I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I> will be murdered: "The child,
abashed, heads for the door. On the threshold, she seems to be torn by
a great inner conflict" ("Sur le seuil, un grand combat para&icirc;t se
livrer en elle")(<I>N</I>,41-42/48). The resonance is reinforced
when Nadja later recalls her kiss with Breton, terming it "a kiss with
a threat in it" (<I>N</I>, 85/98).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the "Manifesto of Surrealism," Breton links the beginning of Surrealist
automatism, in writing and listening, to his encounter with Freud and his
sense of dialogue's importance in psychoanalysis. As he conceptualized
the significance of free and spontaneous speech, Breton's attention
was drawn to the element of a shadow dialogue. "The forms of Surrealist
language adapt themselves best to dialogue. Here two thoughts confront
each other; while one is being delivered, the other is busy with it;
but how is it busy with it?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Automatic listening requires one to listen intensely to silences that
 make for the possibility of a shadow dialogue. But there is a danger in
 such intense opening to dialogue, to listening and to listening through
 silences. For Nadja, transference

<B></B>

turns into utter dependence on Breton, while for Breton transference
is soon struggling with counter-transference. The bodily inscription of
silence in Nadja finds its counterpart in Breton; what is consternation
in her body (and hallucinations recorded through her drawings)
becomes exhaustion, emptiness, migraine. Thus, immediately after his
long encounter with Nadja of 6 October, ending with the midnight walk
in the Tuileries, Breton notes: "<I>October 7</I>. --I have suffered
from a violent headache which, perhaps mistakenly, I attribute to last
night's emotions and also to the effort of attention, of accommodation
which I have had to make. The whole morning, too, I have been bothering
myself about Nadja . . ." ("Toute la matin&eacute;e, pourtant, je me
suis ennuy&eacute; de Nadja. . .") (<I>N</I>, 90/103-4). On this
occasion the pain of his relationship with Nadja does not prevent him
from longing for her, a longing subtly conveyed in the expression "Je
me suis ennuy&eacute;," which in nineteenth-century usage still meant
"I long for you." But such acknowledgements of intermingled longing and
boredom come with a sense of guilt that prompts him to pose the question
of their relationship from Nadja's viewpoint: "How does she regard me,
how does she judge me?" (<I>N</I>, 90/104). That question, in turn, leads
to another passage of marked ambiguity: "When I am near her I am nearer
things which are near her" (<I>N</I>, 90/104). Breton's new relations to
"things which are near her" may be essentially unstable, but at times
they often seem of more interest to him than she herself. That ambiguity
will increasingly be lived through the voice, silence, and intervals
of connection and disconnection. Five days later, on 12 October, on
the day he has received the first of Nadja's drawings, she and Breton
began to walk near the Jardin du Palais Royal; for the first time, Nadja
spontaneously composes what is effectively a pageant for Breton, a mime:

The spontaneity and the character of mime, acting within a texture
of silence, are important to this performance, which represents a
psychological shift for both participants. True, such scenes occur
elsewhere in <I>Nadja</I>, typically when Nadja is being playful. But
this is the only one which abruptly gives way to speech, to voice
displacing silent mime. Nothing of this sort happens later when Nadja
and Breton visit Saint-Germain-en-Laye: "As we walk in front of the
ch&acirc;teau, Nadja says she wants to be Madame de Chevreuse; how
gracefully she conceals her face behind the heavy, nonexistent plume of
her hat!" (<I>N</I>, 108/127). In the earlier scene, instead, Nadja's
insistent voice, "Who killed the Gorgon, tell me, tell," compels Breton
to silence. While Nadja often speaks in soliloquies, Breton's soliloquy
is <I>Nadja</I> and takes place at the level of the construction. As
he wanders through the city, at times paying attention intensely to
Nadja, he comes to admit: "I have more and more difficulty following her
soliloquy, which long silences begin to make unintelligible" (<I>N</I>,
106/125; translation modified). Such silences cannot be translated into
language, and they take place not only between the two protagonists,
but also within them. Is Nadja's "soliloquy" a single monologue

<B></B>

that is interrupted, or many soliloquies originating in different parts
of the psyche? Still, the more pressing problem of translation remains
an inter-subjective one, and it remains linked to the question of the
different temporalities of story and narrative, experience and discourse,
and of how human identity is shaped in language, a question that had
fascinated Breton since his experience in composing <I>The Magnetic
Fields</I>, his first work of automatic writing, penned with Philippe
Soupault in 1919 (published 1920). Silence threatens the possibility of
communication, and raises the spectre that a founding and constitutive
negativity originating in traumatic experience will make it impossible
to construct the traces of events into narrative. Breton is the surviving
witness of a traumatic event, one who continues to marvel at the miracle
that human beings, however intermittently, can communicate with one
another: "How does it happen that thrown together, once and for all, so
far from the earth, in those brief intervals which our marvelous stupor
grants us, we have been able to exchange a few incredibly concordant views
above the smoking debris of old ideas and sempiternal life?" (<I>N</I>,
111/130).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difficulty of traversing the "brief intervals" that lead from
experience to discourse is inherent in human communication. "Perhaps life
needs to be deciphered like a cryptogram," he suggests at one point,
then proceeds to offer an allegory. Imagine a man in a museum at night
who illicitly examines the portrait of a woman: "Secret staircases,
frames from which the paintings quickly slip aside and vanish (giving way
to an archangel bearing a sword or to those who must forever advance)
. . . we may imagine the mind's greatest adventure as a journey of
this sort to <I>the paradise of pitfalls</I>" (<I>N</I>, 112/133; my
emphasis.) Frames of reference or interpretation, in this account, are
emptied out by the slippage and disappearance of their contents, while
the spectator experiences a radical, vertiginous passivity, a loss of the
self that is a precondition for the intense experience of communicative
understanding ("to exchange a few incredibly concordant views").

Recalling the interval of time which has transpired since the day when
Nadja had told him a story about her degrading experience of being
slapped by a man and the present moment when he is recounting her tale
again, Breton comments: "Perhaps, during the same period, the irreparable
disaster sweeping away a part of herself--and the most humanly defined
part--the disaster of which that day gave me a notion, had gradually
separated me from her" (<I>N</I>, 114/136). "The irreparable disaster"
plainly refers to Nadja's borderline condition and the degradation it will
entail. But Breton's syntax so emphasizes the time that separates the two
acts of narration that one might also think that "the disaster" refers
to that intervening time itself, the temporality of construction. Such
temporality had already been outlined in the earlier "Manifesto of
Surrealism" in the section discussing the role that Surrealist dialogue
played in the writing of <I>Magnetic Fields</I>:

The forms of Surrealist language adapt themselves best to dialogue. Here,
two thoughts confront each other; while one is being delivered, the
other is busy with it; but how is it busy with it? To assume that it
incorporates it within itself would be tantamount to admitting that
there is a time during which it is possible for it to live completely
off that other

<B></B>

thought, which is highly unlikely. And, in fact, the attention it
pays is completely exterior; it has only time enough to approve or
reject--generally reject--with all the consideration of which man is
capable. This mode of language, moreover, does not allow the heart of
the matter to be plumbed. My attention, prey to an entreaty which it
cannot in all decency reject, treats the opposing thought as an enemy;
. . . it puts me in a position to turn it to good advantage in my reply
by distorting them. ["MoS," 34/335-36]

The same time that may yield a breathtaking exchange of "concordant views"
can also lead to distance, loss, "disaster."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But, in principle, comprehension cannot be separate from the exteriority
of time, the very exteriority that Breton has built into the conceptual
and phenomenological foundations of Surrealist dialogue. Recalling
his experience in writing "Barriers," the fifth chapter in <I>Magnetic
Fields</I>, which is made up of passages written alternately by Breton
and Soupault, each in response to the other, Breton writes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Poetic Surrealism . . . has focused its efforts up to this point
on reestablishing dialogue in its absolute truth, by freeing both
interlocutors from any obligations of politeness. Each of them simply
pursues his soliloquy without trying to derive any special dialectical
pleasure from it and without trying to impose anything whatsoever upon
his neighbor. . . . The words, the images are only so many springboards
for the mind of the listener. ["MoS," 35/336]

This form of communication, in which two styles of thinking confront one
other, especially encourages participants to identify with one another
through affective mimesis; and, if sufficiently sustained, it resembles
the sort of dialogic communication that distinguishes the analytic
situation, and in particular the silent dynamics of the transference,
as the patient reactivates and reenacts his fundamental conflicts
around the re of the analyst. Yet analysis does not conclude
with the transference; it continues by analyzing the transference
through ongoing dialogue between patient and analyst, carried on in
distinct but linked temporalities. Breton had built this temporality
of distance, of the interval, into Surrealist dialogue and theory;
but it is Nadja who compels him to experience it on the pulses in
contexts extending far beyond Surrealist games, or even listening to
the victims of war neuroses. His encounter with Nadja impels him to
conceive of constructing temporalization, rather than deploying it,
when faced with the overwhelming emptiness, the voids, and the echoes
left by his passage with Nadja. The transference, which in its most
primitive form is mimetic identification, has occurred with Nadja, thus
enabling that creative illusion of relationality which is registered
in the work's discourse of double meaning. When Breton asks Nadja the
"one question which sums up all the rest, a question only I would ever
ask, probably," he is startled to hear for the first time "a reply
worthy of it." "'Who are you?' And she, without a moment's hesitation:
'I am the soul in limbo'" (<I>N</I>, 71/82). When Breton gives her a
copy of his book <I>The Lost Steps</I>, she responds, "Lost steps? But
there's no such thing!" (<I>N</I>, 72/83). After reading Jarry's sonnet,
"Among the Heaths" ("Parmi les bruy&egrave;res"), Nadja says, "Oh! That
must be death!" (<I>N</I>, 73/84). Each of these moving utterances points
to an effect of transference, up to the point where the unconscious

<B></B>

would touch upon death. But at the same time, each points to a different
movement of comprehension, and so to a different relationship between
temporality and memory. In constructing the narrative <I>Nadja</I>,
Breton cannot avoid this disjunction, for Nadja is no longer present to
enable him to escape the solitary reliving of their passage through the
city. Her absence makes the time of Surrealism, from its birth, a time
of disaster and negativity.

Silence is linked to various senses of projection in the construction both
of the narrative of <I>Nadja</I> and Nadja's experiences. In a Freudian
context we can link silence to projection by perceiving interior stimuli
(such as hallucinations) as though they have originated from an external
source. In a psychopathological context we can link silence to projection
as a hypnagogic experience which Maury described as an intermediary
state which places one "in the presence of a dissolution or suspension
of thought near to death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Silence makes it possible to take in the various slippages between
 internal apperception and the external stimulation that comprise the
 encoding dimension of discourse. Freud also notes that silence may
 function as a form of transference, yet silence always carries with it a
 close proximity to death: in silence one straddles precipitously between
 the interior processing of an event and the exteriorizing description
 of that event in narrative structure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Such is the function of communication: namely, to channel dynamic
 experience into frozen time. The act of channelling or translating an
 event into a narrative structure is the act of living, in effect, a life
 that becomes split from itself: in silence one must confront both the
 real time of experience and the frozen time of narrative recreation. This
 bifurcated voice of silence has become one of the prominent concepts in
 the Surrealist movement, beginning with the inaugural hypnagogic phrase,
 "There is a man cut in two by the window": once the silence has been
 broken, the voice of a narrator is disembodied ("MoS," 21/325). In the
 opening passage of "In 80 Days," a chapter in <I>Magnetic Fields</I>,
 we can find the concept of the disembodied voice in the iconography of
 bodily displacement in an urban environment: "The sad Sunday suburbs
 and the lines of a local interest are a sad setting. The newly equipped
 traveller who departs with one idea in his brilliant brain surveys
 with his eyes his house, his chimney and the wide avenues leading to
 the town halls. . . . His tread resounds; he is walking over his heart."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Soupault was not the only artist to depict the doubling hypnotic state as
 a lyric displacement of the body articulated through the imagery of the
 banal urban environment. Surrealist painters also used similar allegories
 in both tragic and lyric treatments of the disembodied voice. We can look
 to Max Ernst's <I>Piet&agrave;, ou la r&eacute;volution de la nuit</I>
 , <I>La belle jardini&egrave;re</I> , and the <I>Victoire
 de Samothrace</I> ; and Joan Mir&oacute;'s <I>Musique, Seine,
 Michel, Bataille et moi</I>  for examples of this allegory
 at work. There is also, in the works of Mir&oacute; and Soupault,
 an exploration of diacritical engagement as a threat to the creative,
 spontaneous possibilities that arise when a physical body resides within
 the space of the city. In <I>Musique, Seine, Michel, Bataille et moi</I>,
 Mir&oacute; allows the apperceived

<B></B>

voice to float in circular wanderings, as does the body image of the
traveller in Soupault's "In 80 Days."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their first meeting together, Nadja identifies herself as such a
wandering spirit when Breton asks her "Who are you?" (<I>N</I>, 71/82). In
the English edition Nadja's answer is "I am the soul in limbo," losing
in translation the sense of movement and travel that is implicit in the
French: "Je suis l'&acirc;me errante" ("I am the wandering soul"). In this
early sequence, Nadja embodies the possibility of becoming for Breton
a kindred spirit, who like Breton roams about the city without distinct
purpose or direction: "She was on her way, she claimed, to a hairdresser
on the Boulevard Magenta (I say claimed because she later admitted she
was going nowhere)" (<I>N</I>, 65/73). Such aimless wanderings echo those
Breton describes in the first section of the narrative, where his own
excursions in the city unfold as a response to the question he poses as
the beginning of his book: "Who am I?" Addressing his readers directly,
Breton describes his ambles about the city streets of Paris in search
of himself:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Meanwhile, you can be sure of meeting me in Paris, of not spending more
than three days without seeing me pass, toward the end of the afternoon,
along the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle between the <I>Matin</I> printing
office and the Boulevard de Strasbourg. I don't know why it should be
precisely here that my feet take me, here that I almost invariably go
without specific purpose, without anything to induce me but this obscure
clue: namely that it will happen here. I cannot see, as I hurry along,
what could constitute for me, even without my knowing it, a magnetic
pole in either space or time. [<I>N</I>, 32/36-38]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their first meeting, the city functions as a backdrop for
Breton and Nadja as they seem to discover in each other a potential
for mutual understanding that defies rational knowledge and logical
progression. Breton recollects that "without a moment's hesitation,
I spoke to this unknown woman, though I must admit that I expected the
worst. She smiled, but quite mysteriously and somehow <I>knowingly</I>,
though I had no reason to think so" (<I>N</I>, 64-65/73; emphasis
in the original). Breton does not need to deploy rationality to perceive
that Nadja possesses an intimate understanding of his "whole manner"
of thinking and speaking (<I>N</I>, 71/82). Nadja's knowledge is itself
a projection, for what Breton is most fascinated by when he looks
into Nadja's eyes is not what those eyes might perceive, but what they
reflect when he looks into them: "I took a better look at her. What was
so extraordinary about what was happening in those eyes? What was it
they reflected . . . ?" (<I>N</I>, 65/73). The question of whether or
not the narrator is capable of seeing in Nadja's eyes the capacity for
perception even as she functions as an instrument of self-reflection is
one question that propels this narrative forward.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's play in the city evokes, and draws upon, a comparable and varied
use of projection in both the gestured slowing down of time in her miming
and in her use of comic mimicry: "Nadja, who has thrown a fold of her cape
back over her shoulder, assumes with astonishing facility the arrogance
of the Devil as he appears in romantic prints" (<I>N</I>, 102/120). These
displacements are a function of projection, especially in Nadja's world
"where everything so rapidly assumed the appearance of a rise, a fall"
(<I>N</I>, 135/159).

<B></B>

In such a world as Nadja's, there is a continuity between the pathology
of the forms of play and dissolution; Breton calls these projected forms
her <I>distractions</I>. There is still a sense that Nadja is able to
distinguish between play and displaced absorption when, for example,
she "supposing herself alone . . . was singing and dancing as she walked
beneath an arcade of the Palais Royal" (<I>N</I>, 101/118). Yet in this
scene Nadja begins dangerously to identify herself with a projected
hallucination as she moves within the trajectory of a city that pierces
her to distraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In his account of their sixth meeting in the diary portion of the book,
 Breton recalls one instance of Nadja's dissolution which turns into an
 accusation that he directs towards himself:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We reach the corner of the Rue de Seine, where we turn, Nadja no longer
wishing to continue straight ahead. She is still quite distressed
[<I>distraite</I>, distracted], and tells me to follow a line slowly
traced across the sky by a hand. "Still that hand." She shows it to me,
as a matter of fact, on a poster, a little beyond the Dorbon bookstore. It
so happens that there is, high above us, a red hand with its index finger
pointing, advertising something or other. Nadja insists on touching this
hand . . . which she succeeds in slapping with her own. "The hand of
fire, it's all you, you know, it's you." She falls silent for a while,
I suspect she has tears in her eyes. Then suddenly . . . virtually
stopping me, with that extraordinary way she has of calling me,
the way you might call someone from room to room in an empty castle:
"Andr&eacute;? Andr&eacute;? . . . You will write a novel about me. I'm
sure you will." (<I>N</I>, 100/116-17; first two ellipses mine,
third ellipsis author's]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through Breton's recollection we learn that Nadja must correlate the
hallucinations she projects from inside with the piercing assault
of stimulation that comes in from outside. Likewise Breton the
author struggles to make sense out of his own projection, the
character "Breton," whose life depends upon the movement of the
narrative scene. Who does Nadja call by name when she accusingly says
"Andr&eacute;? Andr&eacute;? . . . You will write a novel about me"? Who
moves within the narrative and who keeps the narrative moving? A silent
voice resides, ghost-like, in the elliptical space that marks the distance
between "Andr&eacute;" and the narrative he will write about Nadja. The
question of narrative form becomes, in the psychopathology of trauma,
a question of life and death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether we refer to the psychopathological researches of Henri Ey,
inflected by his sympathy for Surrealism, or to the contemporary
researches of psychoanalysts such as F&eacute;dida or Schneider, there
is remarkable continuity in the description of the phenomenology of the
experience of effraction and place (<I>lieu</I>) as "the sensible support
(insofar as it is 'lived' by my body) of the sense of these exchanges;
but it disappears under the sense of its sense."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The sense of support, however, is one of the necessary illusions one
 must conjure to cope with the trauma of bifurcated identity. Such
 an understanding of voice in relation to place necessarily bypasses
 a conventional understanding that would confer to voice a phallic,
 dynamic capacity for penetration into an implicitly passive, fixed
 place. As the montage of photographs, song snippets, and juxtapositions
 of recurrent images as both hallucinations and memories suggest, the
 narrative events in <I>Nadja</I> (and indeed, in Nadja) do not just
 happen <I>in</I> the city, they occur through them.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is impossible to articulate the dynamism of place because this
dynamism, this active engagement in real time, cannot be contained
in narrative structure or identity construction. Absence and presence
(in lost real time, in remembered events, in dreams, in projections and
hallucinations) must be understood in terms of correspondence, where
the presence of one image might presuppose the juxtaposition of other
images in all instances of their reoccurrence. The recurring images of
waving hands, fixed handrails, closing eyes, open windows, and hidden
tunnels suggest an "Originary otherness from which one cannot withdraw
oneself, since it is inseparable from the possibility of being alive"
(<I>Pdl'O</I>, 143). In her study of "Claire," Monique Schneider claims
that the question of presence and absence in place cannot be resolved
by positing place as "the invisible posited as the antithetic of the
visible." Rather, place is what makes the emergence of recognizable forms
possible. Place is where correspondences can be drawn between interior
forms and exterior stimuli:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Place could in no way embody the invisible posited as the antithetic of
the visible; it participates in the deployment of the visible, but without
emerging as recognizable form. It could not moreover be confused with
that which is designated as ground; it is situated on the side of the
support, and not on the side of that which is in relief--<I>whence the
matriciel dimension of transporting space</I>; the earth as transporting
place occurs in the prolongation of what can be attributed to <I>shadow
understood as an internal place from</I> which emerges whatever is going
to be brought into relief, or appear on stage. [<I>Pdl'O</I>, 141]

("Matriciel" is a pyschoanalytic term indicating whatever fulfills for
the feminine the function that the phallic fulfils for the masculine; it
indicates a form of causality that is non-symbolic and non-paternal, in
time that is not linear but cyclical, and is situated at the pre-oedipal
level.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Monique Schneider, another mark or emplacement of trauma
can be found in screams and cries: "The scream is as much in complicity
with the effraction of space as with the passionate movement aiming
to essay the erection of a bridge capable of binding together the
banks which glance at the menace of emptiness. Will the scream arrive
at this other bank, in which the gesture awaited on the part of the
other consists?" (<I>Pdl'O</I>, 113). The effraction of identity
finds its middle, bridging term in silence before and after a cry,
an impassioned, pained cry that courses like an arc from beginning to
end in <I>Nadja</I>. Cries and screams incise the tragic experience of
return and repetition as a confrontation with effraction and proximity
to death. Silence is one mark of trauma that cannot be drawn into the
logic of narrative structure directly but which can nevertheless convey
the sense of vertiginous, horrific confrontation with an effraction of
identity that so closely approximates death. Such cries mark events,
enclosing them in an interior or psychic (Breton might claim feminine)
place. The close of the play <I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I>, for
example, culminates in an "unforgettable scream" ("le cri inoubliable")
(<I>N</I>, 49/53)--an event that draws a correspondence between
the non-discursive mark of ineffability in the cry and the head of a
"missing" child whose presence is shockingly revealed in the opening
of a cabinet door: "The child's bloody corpse appears, head downward,
and falls onto the floor" (<I>N</I>, 49/53).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 The vulnerability of

<B></B>

rationality, the fragility of the structures that allow rational, causal
correspondences to be drawn, is showcased in the re of the inverted,
falling head. In another episode, Breton attempts to embrace Nadja but
"suddenly, as I am kissing her, she screams. 'There (pointing to the top
of the window), someone's there. I just saw a head upside down--very
clearly'" (<I>N</I>, 107/126). One of the saddest, most shocking
repetitions of this motif can be found in Breton's anecdote of M. Delouit,
"a story that was so stupid, so melancholy, and so moving" (<I>N</I>,
155/183). M. Delouit is partially aphasic, incapable of remembering
certain things such as numbers and certain proper names. He comes to
rent a room at a hotel and informs the assistant of his condition:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Excuse me, I have no memory at all. If you please, each time I come
in, I'll tell you my name: Monsieur Delouit. And each time you'll tell
me the number of my room."-- "Very well, Monsieur." Soon afterwards, he
returns, and as he passes the desk says: "Monsieur Delouit."--"Number 35,
Monsieur."--"Thank you." A minute later, a man extraordinarily upset,
his clothes covered with mud, bleeding, his face almost not a face
at all, appears at the desk: "Monsieur Delouit." "What do you mean,
Monsieur Delouit? Don't try to put one over on us! Monsieur Delouit
has just gone upstairs!"--"I'm sorry, it's me . . . I've just fallen
out of the window. What's the number of my room, please?" [<I>N</I>,

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fall and presumed screams of M. Delouit are not explicitly described
in the contents of the narrative itself, but are implied by Breton's
judicious use of narrative techniques both within and outside of this
story within a story. The ellipses that frame this account as well as the
dashes and ellipses internal to the story mark the ineffable traces of
trauma on M. Delouit's body and the subsequent effraction or effacement
of his identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tragic effacement of M. Delouit correlates with the thematics of
doubling as mime and mimicry (no less than the problem of identity
in relation to language); the drawing of correspondences enacts a
mechanism of substitution that can ultimately endanger a cohesive sense
of identity. When Nadja mimics Mme. de Chevreuse she ". . . gracefully
. . . conceals her face behind the heavy, nonexistent plume of her
hat!" (<I>N</I>, 108/127). The allure of the face of an actress mimicking
another face is, in such a scene, the allure of Melusine, Medusa, or
the Siren. The 'killing look' is the reflection that one obsessively
seeks out yet must avoid if one is to survive the encounter intact. The
mimicked image and the ineffable cry are traces of inscription, the
sometimes horrifying evidence of an attempt to forge a direct link to what
F&eacute;dida and Schneider have called the feminine (<I>jouissance</I>)
as place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The city landscape is such a place, a backdrop that functions much like
the screen in the analytic situation. The screen (itself a surface of
multiplicities) becomes a protective shield that both the analyst and
the analysand need to sustain the therapeutic dialogue. We can find
the city allegorized as a screen in <I>Nadja</I>, in the chapter of
<I>Magnetic Fields</I> which is titled "In 80 Days," in Louis Aragon's
novel <I>Paris Peasant</I>, as well as in Desnos's <I>Liberty or Love</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Surrealist painters such as Mir&oacute; (<I>Musique, Seine, Michel,
 Battaille et moi</I>) and Man Ray (<I>L'&eacute;toile de mer</I>)
 also allegorize the city as the

<B></B>

backdrop that makes it possible for its inhabitants to sustain their
necessary illusions. Nadja's body, whether extended to the drawings or
situated in the city, navigates along the fault line between dynamic
interior stimuli and exterior excitation. The distance between Nadja
and Breton, as well as the disjunction between the two characters
and the city they inhabit, is the mark of their effraction. Nadja's
interactions with the city are increasingly pathological close calls
with city emplacement as <I>jouissance</I>; observing "that hand on the
Seine" across the sky (<I>N</I>, 85/98), she threatens to tear away the
very screen that protects her freedom of movement. She is in danger
of immobilizing herself by staring directly into the face of Medusa,
that is, by seeing herself as nothing more than a character that has
been frozen into the logic of narrative space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The photograph of the wax model from the Mus&eacute;e Grevin suggests the
dangers inherent in the enactment of mimetic substitution by correlating
emplacement with <I>jouissance</I>. Breton included this photograph in
the 1963 edition of <I>Nadja</I> and described it as ". . . an adorable
wax-work re in the Mus&eacute;e Grevin . . . a woman fastening her
garter in the shadows, and it is the only statue I know of with eyes,
the eyes of provocation" (<I>N</I>, 152/177-79). Importantly, the
photograph of the wax re found in <I>Nadja</I> is cropped in such a
way that our attention is drawn not to the re's adorable "eyes of
provocation" but towards two busy, fastening hands that are fumbling
with a garter. The "eyes of provocation" that have gone missing from
the photograph of the wax re correlate implicitly and uncannily
with Breton's description of Nadja's "fern-colored eyes" (<I>N</I>,
111/130), while the garter directly recalls the character Solange in
<I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I> as she lifts her skirt, "revealing a
beautiful leg . . . a little above the black garter" (<I>N</I>, 45/49),
the role played by Blanche Derval, "the <I>only</I> actress of the period"
(<I>N</I>, 49/55; emphasis in original).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's own city play can be correlated to trauma as is red by Pierre
F&eacute;dida, who provides a phenomenological account of analytic
experience in the context of the psychopathology of <I>informe</I>
conditions: "It is clear that every effraction of the protective
shield--every perforation of the separating membrane protecting the
inside from the outside, which brings about a linkage of the two--is,
in the first instance, the basic sense of traumatic experience."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Breton conveys Nadja's experience of the outside by shrouding the
 sequence of events in ambiguity. The narrator forges a sense of
 continuity by presenting events not in chronological order but
 through repetition and through correlation. For example, Nadja's
 rejoinder that she "no longer wish[es] to continue straight ahead"
 ("r&eacute;sistant &agrave; aller plus loin") (<I>N</I>, 100/116) echoes
 an earlier meeting with Breton where Nadja, refuses "to go any further"
 ("d'aller plus loin"):

As we walk along the quais, I feel that Nadja is trembling all
over. . . . She is very abandoned in her behavior, very sure of me. But
she is looking for something, she insists that we walk into a courtyard,
a courtyard of some police station, which she rapidly explores. "It's
not here. . . . Listen, tell me why you have to go to prison? What is
it you're going to do? I've been to prison too. Who was I? It was ages
ago. And you, then, who were you?" [<I>N</I>, 84/97; first ellipsis mine,

In this passage Nadja ushers Breton into a courtyard and asks him "tell me
why you have to go to prison? What is it you're going to do?" Breton uses
Nadja's accusation to foreshadow his responsibility (as author) for her
subsequent disappearance. Nadja's question "Who was I?" is anything but
rhetorical when we consider the scene as a staged confrontation between
Breton the author and Breton as character/projection. The protective
screen that allows this confrontation to take place also turns Nadja into
an agent who, in turn, becomes a medium for Breton, though each permits
this to happen unconsciously. The possibility that Nadja and Breton might
forge a reciprocal understanding of each other as co-inhabitants of the
same city landscape is thus foreclosed; Breton turns Nadja's insistence
that they stop moving forward into an occasion to interrogate, via Nadja's
questions of identity, his own success or failure at producing a reliable
translation of true events. Thus, the authenticity of Breton's narrative
is guaranteed through his disclaimer that Nadja is, or was, a living
person whose presence can be felt in those textual aporias that have,
in psychoanalytic discourse, been closely correlated with death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's close proximity to death is also correlated with her fear
of abandonment, red as the threat of free-falling, uncontrolled
motion. Before she and Breton visit the courtyard that becomes the scene
that foreshadows the crime of her disappearance, Nadja describes the sense
of vertigo she felt when surveying a high window from the perspective
of another high window. She echoes the sense of dislocation invoked
in the hypnogogic phrase, "There is a man cut in two by the window,"
that features in the "Manifesto of Surrealism" ("MoS," 21/325): "'It
was there, from a window in the H&ocirc;tel Henri IV, and my friend, the
second man I told you about, was about to leave. And there was a voice
saying "You're going to die, you're going to die." I didn't want to die,
but I felt so dizzy. . . . I'd certainly have fallen if he hadn't held
me back'" (<I>N</I>, 84/97; ellipsis in original). The unnamed man who
"held her back" is replaced, in the following passage, by Breton, a man
with whom Nadja refuses to move forward until she has surveyed, to her
satisfaction, a low-lying window that overlooks a moat:

Now we are walking along the iron grill railing again, when suddenly
Nadja refuses to go any further. Here on the right, is a low window that
overlooks the moat, and she cannot take her eyes off it. It is in front
of this window which looks so forlorn that we must wait, she knows that
much. It is from here that everything can come. It is here that everything
begins. She holds on to the railing with both hands so that I will not
pull her away. She virtually stops answering my questions. . . . She has
not forgotten about the underground tunnel and probably imagines she
is at one of its exits. She wonders who she might have been, in Marie
Antoinette's circle. The footsteps of passers-by make her shudder for
a long time. [<I>N</I>, 84-85/97-98]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The window overlooking a great divide is a pivotal allegory of bifurcated
identity in the narrative that grants Nadja, in <I>Nadja</I>, her
identity. But like the dislocating and vertiginous heights of a window,
this fragile identity is itself dislocated from its own surroundings. The
footsteps of nameless, faceless passers-by invoke for Nadja a horror
that time can march on without her. Yet who or what is responsible for
Nadja's increasingly

<B></B>

 disjunctive and fragile state? She implicates Breton himself during their
 third encounter, where "She seems to be suffering from a certain inner
 conflict, but suddenly she surrenders, closes her eyes for good, offers
 me her lips. . . . Now she tells me of my power over her, of my faculty
 for making her think and do whatever I desire, perhaps more than I think
 I desire. Because of this, she begs me to do nothing against her. She
 feels she has never had any secrets from me, long before knowing me"
 (<I>N</I>, 79/92; ellipsis in original). Breton makes his own authorial
 anxiety and sense of guilty remorse a feature of these scenes, for it
 is when Nadja most emphatically implores Breton to stop moving that
 the narrative drives relentlessly forward. When Nadja stops moving,
 Breton explores the duality of identity at the core of the question of
 communication. The questions "Who were you?" and "Who am I?" recriminate
 a culpable author residing outside of the narrative space. Ironically,
 the recrimination is like a certificate of authenticity beguiling the
 reader into believing that the story of <I>Nadja</I> is a story <I>sans
 artifice</I>. When the story invokes the fluid temporality of dynamic
 events, the problem of voice becomes not only the problem of translation
 but the problem of ventriloquism ("She tells me of my power over her").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As F&eacute;dida suggested in his analysis of trauma, the successful
communicative exchange involves a sacrifice, namely, the fixing of the
dynamic movement of events within the frozen time of narrative. And as we
have seen earlier, Nadja's talent for mime and mimicry makes clear that
her body must necessarily be subordinated to the narrative voice--even as
this body, as corpse or as corpus, provides the grounds or place through
which this narrative voice might speak. The problem of projection
becomes, in the construction of the narrative, a ventriloquist's
act. Such ventriloquism shadows the movement of the analytic dialogue,
where projection is used to identify (and thereby contain) the trace or
memory of trauma. When the narrator claims that the real Nadja once said
"You will write a novel about me. . . . You have to," Breton the author
is acknowledging the necessity for using Nadja's voice, through Nadja
the character or projection, to suture himself back together again. Yet
Breton also realizes that in his recollections what he captures or
contains is never the biographical person behind the name Nadja, but
the complex projection that he needs to maintain his own variety of
necessary illusions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their meeting of 10 October Nadja identifies Andr&eacute; as the
man who will have a hand in her undoing (and subsequent literary redoing
when she claims that he will one day write a novel about her). The reality
of the author's story is confirmed in a broken exchange, but only, as we
have seen before, by casting a long shadow of doubt over the stability
of the narrator's sanity as well. Breton the author carefully explores
the anguish that motivates Breton the character to justify his chronic
storytelling, via Nadja's tacit blessing that he must write a novel about
her. Breton's anguish continues to register through Nadja long after she
is gone; the literary marks of silence (the ellipses, the dashes, the
caesuras) voice those questions that Nadja can no longer ask directly:
whose story is being told? for whom is this story being told? and what
is necessarily missing?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton and Nadja begin their romantic exchange full of the possibility
offered by the dynamic landscape of the city. But as Breton realizes that
he is incapable of loving Nadja the way he believes she needs him to love
her, Nadja is increasingly absorbed into the fabric of city space. The
temporary fascination that draws Breton to Nadja is no match for the
permanent power that yokes Nadja to Breton: "How does she regard me,
how does she judge me? It is unforgivable of me to go on seeing her
if I do not love her. Don't I love her? . . . In her condition, she is
certainly going to need me, one way or another, and suddenly" (<I>N</I>,
90/104). For Breton, the city landscape continues to function as a
backdrop and as a screen, providing him with the cover he needs to sustain
the necessary illusions that drive the otherwise disjunctive narrative
forward. Breton's narrative ends with allusions to the technologies of
escape, to planes, trains and automobiles. But as Nadja's fate unfolds,
her range of motion is increasingly constricted and finally ends in
the confinement of a lunatic asylum. Nadja too is like the landscape of
the city, a screen upon which the main players will enact their drama
of identification vis &agrave; vis her embodiment of that necessary,
distancing silence. In the literary space of <I>Nadja</I>, the interaction
takes place within the traumatized, bifurcated identity of Breton himself
as he faces the repercussions of creating a story <I>sans artifice</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passivity characteristic of <I>Nadja</I>'s construction is a
device through which Breton, though now separate from her in time and
place and yet still traumatized by the "irreparable disaster" that has
overtaken her, seeks to encounter Nadja herself, or Nadja as she might
have been. The effects of his experience with her continue to leave
their mark on the writing of <I>Nadja</I>, and it is only in the act of
writing that he begins to understand her. It is as if Nadja's madness,
her borderline state, is her insight into the mechanizations that lie
beyond the confines of her own frozen, atemporal world; the narrative
must move on, even though she continues to hope that something will
remain of her experience shared with Breton.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anonymous footsteps march ahead; the particulars of time and place
are, Nadja recognizes, in themselves immaterial. The French play on
"pas," meaning both "footsteps" and "not" is lost in translation in
the English edition. In the French, the step that is taken can suggest
the foreclosure of all other possibilities of movement: a journey as a
narrowing down of possibilities. The anonymous footsteps remind Nadja
not only that time moves on without her, but that she herself may one
day become a voided and anonymous "not" (or "has-been"). Breton's guilt
in this scene is doubly correlated to Nadja's tragicomic mourning ritual:
he knows that Nadja is doomed in her "madness" to remain, in <I>Nadja</I>,
an embodiment of projection. She may be removed from the narrative scene,
but Nadja will never entirely disappear. She is doomed to remain in a
perpetual free fall towards death. We can find traces of Nadja in the
textual marks of silence that return us to the problem of construction
and to the enigma, <I>Qui vive?</I> ("Who lives?") (<I>N</I>, 144/172):

By insisting that Breton must write a novel because "'everything fades,

the narrator's authorial power to reconstruct a journey that begins
with the question "Who am I?" But even as the narrator invokes, in the
book's final section, technologies that facilitate movement and travel,
Breton's journey is suspended by a question that must elude his powers
of recollection. In the textual marks of silence, in trauma, there is a
persistent enigma "neither static nor dynamic" (<I>N</I>, 160/190) that
eludes both death and the freeze of narrative time; namely, the question:
"Who was <I>she</I>?"

When we experience a transition from consciousness to expression or
from perception to consciousness, a radical failure of symbolization
such as silence can seemingly turn the body into the only available
medium for responding to the world or perceiving it, at least in
psychopathological conditions. The unforgettable scream in <I>Les
D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I>, Nadja's trembling, or her sense of being
observed from behind (the latter two common schizophrenic symptoms)
capture this sense of alienation and emptiness. Both Nadja and Breton
experience the dislocating bifurcation of identity that is concomitant
with traumatic experience, but they do not share the same experience
or sense of temporality. While Nadja straddles between the world of
dynamic events and the realm of frozen time characteristic of narrative
structure, Breton experiences a temporality that is related to, yet
never wholly coincides with, hers. Yet the "concordant views," those
rare but breathtaking possibilities of communicative exchange evoked
by Breton, occur only in the negativity of just such moments, those
intervals that are also the basis of temporality in narrative/identity
construction. To better understand Breton's invocation of such
possibilities for communicative exchange or dialogue, we can look to his
use of photographs and song fragments in <I>Nadja</I>, devices related to
a motif of enigmatic traces that is discernible not only in <I>Nadja</I>
but throughout Breton's oeuvre, beginning with "The Unsilvered Mirror"
and "Seasons," the first two chapters in <I>Magnetic Fields</I> .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most telling critical responses to <I>Nadja</I> have been those of
Maurice Blanchot and Michel Beaujour.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Blanchot's essay has been less influential among art historians,
 while key themes and terms from Beaujour's essay have influenced both
 art historians and literary critics, especially his arguments about
 classifying the photographs and more generally the role of photography
 within <I>Nadja.</I> Breton, in order to construct a

<B></B>

story <I>sans artifice</I>, that is, a work intended not to be a novel
(<I>romanesque</I>), deploys a procedure of modal patterning that groups
smaller anecdotes into larger structures which, as they aggregate,
develop into coherent and cohesive patterns. An organizational structure
similar to that of retinal memory develops, despite self-evident
discontinuities. Such structures suggest the "existence of a network
wherein each element, by its proximity to another one, takes up and
confirms the authenticity both of the other elements surrounding it
and of the system as a whole" ("QqN," 785). As new elements become
attached to this montage, the illusion that these fixed images continue
to correspond to the lost continuous time of real events is created to
"bring about multiple regroupings. This is the role which has devolved
to the forty-seven photographs of the revised edition"("QqN," 785).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beaujour's comments have been modified by those of Arrouye and Ades. Jean
Arrouye's study of photography in <I>Nadja</I> recognizes certain
trans-iconic themes which are disclosed through the photographs: the
themes of what he calls "the regard" and "departure," both subsumed in a
broader theme of "recommencement." For Arrouye, the photographs function
as "an activator of the imaginary" in <I>Nadja</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Dawn Ades describes the non-literary function of the photographs which
 record the irrational nature of events in <I>Nadja</I>. She especially
 focuses on the almost complete absence of people in the photographs
 depicting the city. "At the risk of overdetermining these images,"
 she urges, "I think that the avoidance of the bustle of human activity
 and city life is deliberate and relates to a preoccupation referred
 to on the cover of the fourth issue of <I>La R&eacute;volution
 surr&eacute;aliste</I>, which bore the photograph of a mannequin
 ascending a curved staircase. The caption runs: 'And War on Work.' What
 was implied there is stated clearly in <I>Nadja</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 But much earlier than the "War on Work" is Breton's fascination with De
 Chirico's empty squares, above all <I>The Engima of a Day</I> . We
 can find a conspicuous nod to the empty squares motif already in the
 first photograph to appear in the book, a statue of Rousseau standing
 before the H&ocirc;tel des Grands Hommes, its sharp relief accentuating
 the flat grid of windows behind it. Another model for the diction of
 emptiness in <I>Nadja</I>'s photographs are the haunting pictures of
 <I>Vieux Paris</I> taken by Atget, some of which were published in the
 journal <I>La Revolution surr&eacute;aliste</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton's notorious distaste for work or labor does indeed find expression
in <I>Nadja</I>, as Ades argues, but it is not in the photographs. They,
instead, engage the question of absence, and do so in relation to
issues of voice and the problem of place as it appears in the narrative
construction. There can be no conception of place, whether in metaphysics,
phenomenology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis or deconstructive reflection,
that is separable from a conception of memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 This is especially true for a notion of psychic or an interior sense
 of place, which inevitably depends on a notion of the past as the trace
 of experience, as memories which are lodged in the unconscious. Breton
 explicitly links memory to the way anachronic traces are structured in
 psychic or interior space; the fragility of this link between memory
 and psychic place is one of the organizing themes that give rise to the
 narrative structure of <I>Nadja</I> as a series of repetitious events
 and correlating, juxtaposing images.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was partly as a consequence of his view of memory that Breton shared
the skepticism toward photography that was common in the culture of
Surrealism. The title of Mir&oacute;'s painting, <I>Photo: ceci est la
couleur de mes r&ecirc;ves</I>  (<I>Photograph: This is the Color
of My Dreams</I>), wittily dismisses photography in a manner which Breton
would easily have endorsed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Photography, it says, cannot capture the color of dreams. Similarly,
 when discussing Man Ray, Breton would reflect: "The photographic
 print, considered in isolation, is certainly permeated with an
 emotive value that makes it a supremely precious article of exchange
 . . . nevertheless, despite the fact that it is endowed with a special
 power of suggestion, it is not in the final analysis the <I>faithful</I>
 image that we aim to retain of something that will soon be gone for
 ever."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Photography, in short, cannot fulfill the functions of memory. No
 photograph could capture, for example, the "low window that overlooks
 the moat" which so absorbs Nadja's attention that she "cannot take
 her eyes off" it (<I>N</I>, 84/97). No photograph could reproduce the
 hallucination she experiences in the Place Dauphine, "Where only two or
 three couples are at this moment fading into the darkness, she seems to
 see a crowd. 'And the dead, the dead!'" (<I>N</I>, 83/94-96). Nor
 did Breton's mistrust of the medium hinge on the difference between
 straight (or realistic) and experimental photography, at least if we
 understand the latter to mean adopting procedures that foreground the
 unmotivated nature of the sign. For such procedures would be irrelevant
 for <I>Nadja</I>, since movement in its narrative is always motivated,
 as is any psychic movement that is matriciel. For this reason, signs
 that mark the transition from interiority to exteriority or vice versa,
 including voice, cannot be merely a function of a discursive field;
 instead they mark the very limit of the discursive, even call for its
 reconration. The motivated nature of the sign entails a relation to
 memory, however tacit or unconscious, one that conjoins the orders of the
 audible (voice) and the visual (the photographs) insofar as both negate
 the discursive and stand on the brink of its reconration. The trace
 or mark looks forward, one might say, to an object or event that is about
 to happen (the reconration of discourse), even while it registers the
 sense of risk experienced and relived in memory, through construction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton was strongly attracted to the idea that dreams epitomized a world
of pure continuity, conceiving of them much as Lacan later defined the
Real, or that which lies outside the symbolic process, when he wrote that
"The Real is without fissures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Memory, in contrast, is a violation of such continuity, a form of
 negativity not unlike death. As Breton writes in the "Manifesto of
 Surrealism": "In the limits where they operate (or are thought to
 operate) dreams give every evidence of being continuous and show signs of
 organization. Memory alone arrogates to itself the right to excerpt from
 dreams, to ignore the transitions, and to depict for us rather a series
 of dreams than the <I>dream itself"</I> ("MoS," 11/317). Surrealism,
 instead, introduces its practitioners into the secret society of death:
 "It will glove your hand, burying therein the profound M with which
 the word Memory begins" ("MoS," 32/334), alluding to the French word
 for death, <I>la mort</I>. Earlier in his "Carnets," when speculating
 on memory, observation, and imagination and their relation to past,
 present, and future, Breton envisages the possibility that memory might
 be conceived as a function of imagination and

<B></B>

the future, a viewpoint which would turn the present into an evanescent
point: "Substitution doesn't even exist, why. Negation of death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Such a notion would effectively dissever time from any sense
 of direction; the present instead would belong to the order and
 experience of place (a point), one which would admit no sense of movement
 either toward or away from. Memory, seen in this light, would become a
 non-temporal place (<I>lieu anachronique</I>), while death would become a
 non-temporalizing event (<I>&eacute;v&eacute;nement anachronique</I>). It
 is between place and event that the photographs of <I>Nadja</I> occur.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shortly after Breton raises the possibility that people might "exchange a
few incredibly concordant views above the smoking debris of old ideas"
(<I>N</I>, 111/130), and shortly after he senses "the irreparable
disaster" that is engulfing Nadja (<I>N</I>, 114/136), he resolves that
he will persist in his effort of recuperation and reparation vis &agrave;
vis Nadja, but pursue a different strategy:

It would be futile to multiply here instances of unusual happenings
which apparently concern only the two of us and dispose me, for the most
part, in favor of a certain finalism which might permit us to explain
the particularity of anything, happenings, I say, of which Nadja and I
have been the simultaneous witnesses or of which only one of us has been
the witness. I no longer wish to remember, as the days go by, any but a
few of her sentences, spoken or written spontaneously in my presence,
sentences in which I best recapture the tone of her voice and whose
resonance remains so great within me. [<I>N</I>, 115/137]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton goes on to record nine sentences, but the first two are especially
pertinent: "'With the end of my breath, which is the beginning of yours'"
(<I>N</I>, 115/137); and "'If you wish, for you I would be nothing, or
merely a trace'" (<I>N</I>, 116/137; translation modified). These maxims
fall within the understanding of Lacan's <I>la parole fondatrice,</I>
that use of dialogue which hinges on the movement of pronouns as the
medium of subjective repositionings whereby the participants are changed
by virtue of their participation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But they also open up another possibility. Breton, when he recounts
 the story of his rapport with Nadja, consistently notes that their
 mutual but distinct temporalities remain in a shadow dialogue with each
 other. His decision to persist in his pursuit of Nadja, "quite beyond
 any question of luck" (<I>N</I>, 91/105) and quite beyond anecdote or
 story into mere transcription of her aphorisms, is a logical extension
 of the way in which the narrative construction has recorded the effects
 of negativity. Consider such phrasing as "the tone of her voice," its
 "resonance . . . within me," "the end of my breath," or "a trace"
 (<I>N</I>, 115-16/137). These capture a growing sense of the
 tenuous and insubstantial, while simultaneously offering a promise of
 life, the hope that people can communicate "concordant views" despite
 the gaps that divide them. Each phrase, too, captures the sense of an
 experience in negative ("end of my breath," or to be "nothing, or merely
 a trace"). Placed in their perlocutionary context, however, where the
 narrator uses them like a gesture to summon up Nadja's presence, the
 aphorisms become quasi-silent counterparts to the photographs; in them,
 memory functions as a non-temporal place (<I>lieu anachronique</I>),
 just as the song fragments will function as a form of death, a
 non-temporalizing event (<I>&eacute;v&eacute;nement anachronique</I>).

There are many moments in <I>Nadja</I> that allude to Breton's earlier
prose poem, "Soluble Fish," or which echo its sonorities. The most
dramatic occurs on 6 October, a little prior to Nadja's "distractions"
or hallucinations. Heading for the Rue Dauphine, Nadja and Breton wander
instead into the Place Dauphine, "where," Breton goes on to explain,
"curiously enough, another episode of 'Soluble Fish' occurs: 'A kiss is
so quickly forgotten'" (<I>N</I>, 80/93).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Breton is alluding to section 24 of "Soluble Fish," in which lyrical
 evocations of a day are woven round the refrain to a forgotten
 popular song, "A Kiss Is So Quickly Forgotten." The allusion creates
 a vertiginous montage of memories. Breton is carried away from Nadja
 and the Place Dauphine to an episode in "Soluble Fish," but it is
 never clear whether he has made a simple allusion to a <I>literary</I>
 work or whether, indeed, one experience has connected with another,
 with the memory of the "lady friend" ("mon amie") in "Soluble Fish"
 who "speaks in aphorisms" like those of the later Nadja.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Section 24 of "Soluble Fish" contains several registers of fragmentation,
 and each is linked with a mode of presenting the feminine in a way that
 recalls the presentation of song fragments in Picasso's hermetic Cubism:
 the speech of the beloved in sententious form; a song fragment that
 is the refrain for a song which is never named; or the dissolution of
 song into water, "so that in the morning all that was left of us was
 that song . . . that lapped a bit of night water in the center of the
 square" ("SF," 87/380). The dissolution of song into water turns into
 the movement of water in defined forms: "We passed by unnoticed by
 the curves down there, sinusoids, parabolas, geysers, rains" ("SF,"
 88/380), leading to the final presentation of the body via metonymy,
 faces and hands that persist amid the disappearance or effacement of
 interacting bodies since: "We in turn put on the garments of pure air"
 ("SF," 88/381). The movement of memory begun cannot stop here, not
 least because it opens onto another dimension of experiencing the
 feminine. The recounting voice of "Soluble Fish" declares: "My eyes
 were the flower of a hazel tree, my right eye the male flower, my left
 the female flower" ("SF," 87/381). That passage is plainly echoed in
 <I>Nadja</I> when Breton discusses <I>The Lovers' Flower</I>, Nadja's
 drawing which depicts an intertwining pair of eyes: it was "essentially
 under this sign that the time we spent together should be placed"
 (<I>N</I>, 116/140). Such imagery and diction is overdetermined in a
 way that would have disposed Breton to <I>feel</I> such transpositions
 as significant; after all, at the close of "The Unsilvered Mirror"
 (chapter one of <I>Magnetic Fields</I>) he had envisaged "plants of
 the greatest beauty, male rather than female and often both at once"
 (<I>MF</I>, 30/33). Elsewhere in <I>Magnetic Fields</I> moments of
 plenitude are rendered in terms that link the register of the audible
 with a sense of the body being suffused, as in the following passage
 from "Seasons": "The elephant tusks lean on the star-rise steps so
 that the princess can descend and the bands of musicians step out of
 the sea. There is nobody but me now on this sonorous scale-platform,
 the equivocal wavering of which is my harmony. Ah! to descend with
 one's hair down and limbs in disarray in the whiteness of the rapids"
 (<I>MF</I>, 36/39-40). The sustained development of the register
 of the audible--of intensive focal listening, a passivity in which
 sound approaches its own spatiality as touching upon, becoming one with
 space--goes together with the kind of fragmentary movement in image
 clusters which characterizes automatic writing.

 Thus,

<B></B>

again in "Seasons," we are told: "I have so much sand in my ears,
moreover, that I do not know how I shall learn your language" (<I>MF</I>,
37). In such listening (<I>l'&eacute;coute automatique</I>), in which
attention hovers uneasily between inside and outside and objects of
thought are rendered indistinct, the tendency to fragmentation not
only preempts the presentation of whole objects, it tends to make the
object pulse, blink, fold, peek, and dematerialize into waves, rhythms,
or intervals which are encircled by sonorous auras. The subject of
attention, meanwhile, is returned to the matriciel dimension of place in
which time is essentially cyclical, so questioning the phallic dimension
of spatiality. Or as Rousseau put it, recalling the dear old nurse who
had attended his birth, "The hands which opened my eyes at birth will
be able to close them for me at death" ("Les mains qui m'ouvrirent les
yeux. . .").

Rousseau's thought bears on the song fragment and the status of
recollection in <I>Nadja</I>. Breton begins one of the unpublished
divisions of "Soluble Fish": "A memory doubtless the first and the one
that prompted the stars to flower, to open their hands" (". . . fleurir
les astres, ouvrir les mains)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The text evokes tones that recall Lacan's Imaginary order, one of
 mirror-images, identifications, and reciprocities, with images of
 shadowed deflections that make up the elements and part-objects of
 fantasy and instinct, especially in the juxtaposition of delight and
 threat. Deploying diction that echoes the ending of "The Unsilvered
 Mirror" in <I>Magnetic Fields</I>, a scene in which children's frenzied
 activity is calmed by gentle erotic hypnotism, the text of "Soluble Fish
 [II]" describes a psychic state in which: "The appetites are calmed by
 struggles, the anxieties the doors under which slips a serpent. This
 memory, pacified, bruised, worked like an iron grill, sometimes cedes
 its place to a pellet of poison" ("SF [II]," 515). Those who solicit
 this memory "are big. But the garden of persecutions closes its gates
 on them and they remain trapped by hosts with spider feet" ("SF [II],"
 515). The texture of the work of memory--an iron grill--calls to and
 transposes the presence of water emblematic of the interior life:
 "Sheet of water that the interior life, devoted to traces and to
 calls of moving sand" ("SF [II]," 516). It is in this register that
 the most telling aspect of the realm of imaginary identifications in
 Breton's sensibility is presented. For the ensuing equivocations not
 only dramatize the anachronic or timeless aspect of the unconscious and
 make clear the implicit relation between the emergence of temporality
 and the feminine in experience; they stage <I>thinking in relation to
 the feminine</I> as something inescapable, a state of enchantment and
 hypnotic fascination. Thus, in a scene that works under the form of a
 metonymic presentation of tears and joyous melancholy, we come upon:
 "But a female silhouette inscribed in heart-rain, an encirclement of
 butterflies in a thought, there it is, which detours the forked time
 of our pedestals of white frost" ("SF [II]," 516). The obliquity of
 the "female silhouette" ("silhouette de femme") presages a structure
 of shadows. In another section of the unpublished "Soluble Fish," one
 which presents a Judgment of Paris scene and begins, "You are a shadow,
 nothing but a shadow that is descending from a bell tower" ("SF [II],"
 552) the text urges that "there is also a strange rain that resembles
 death" ("SF [II]," 553). Time, in this passage, is encompassed along
 with memory and light and the shapes identified in Breton's conception
 with thinking, above all, the

<B></B>

curve such as in the earlier poem "Sunflower": "Had I business with the
ambassadress of saltpeter / Or the white curve on the black background
we call thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 In the following passage from "Soluble Fish," it is the movement of
 light, water, and shadow in relation to memory and temporality that is
 telling: "Through pierced towers, under the wing of vegetal flags which
 signal nature's barrack to the humans in transit, subsequent to spaces
 and by the force of things, the shadow regains somewhat the terrain that
 we had made it yield" ("SF [II]," 516). The prepositional structure
 of this passage ("Through . . . under . . . subsequent to . . .";
 "Au travers . . . sous . . . par la suite . . .") not only textures
 the movement, but also shapes the structure of shadow extending from
 the "female silhouette" to the "vegetal flags," from "spaces" into
 "the shadow [that] regains somewhat the terrain that we had made it
 yield." The prose poem closes by personifying memory, which now appears
 partly as projective identification, partly as waiting, and partly
 as desire and anticipated loss: "It is in this wasteland that I await
 memory maddened from all the rendez-vous to be had on the surface of
 the earth. A beam dances on the crystal molehill and from this molehill
 memory issues like a sheaf of irises, for the greatest satisfaction of
 the senses crumpled before opening up like gravestones" ("SF [II],"
 516). Memory, in this view, comes from a mixture of light ("a beam")
 and darkness ("a molehill"), a mixture which is given texture and volume
 ("des sens chifonn&eacute;s," or "some rumpled meanings") ("SF [II],"
 516) and hence an element of the timelessness of the unconscious
 (<I>anachronique</I>). In another section of "Soluble Fish [II],"
 the relationship between memory and death which Breton perceived is
 suggested by evoking ephemerality: "You have not the sombre air of
 reason in your brilliant closing, beautiful as the root of passions,
 you do not know why ardor comes to light. You are the only bird for
 each one of us, the bird which throws itself into the assault of the
 precipice and which must live but for an hour" ("SF [II]," 553).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Breton, as I have argued, conceived of memory as a place, and place
as feminine, then it should come as no surprise that certain places,
especially those most connected with Nadja or most evocative of "Soluble
Fish" (the work which most directly explores the texture of the maternal),
should prompt ambivalent reactions on his part. When he accidentally
wanders into the Place Dauphine he comments: "The Place Dauphine is
certainly one of the most profoundly secluded places I know of, one of
the worst wastelands in Paris. Whenever I happen to be there, I feel the
desire to go somewhere else gradually ebbing out of me, I have to struggle
against myself to get free from a gentle, over-insistent, and, finally,
crushing embrace" (<I>N</I>, 80/93). Here we recognise the register of
panic prompted by the texture of the maternal, a texture that subtly
evokes the threat associated with the Sirens, that of immobilization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The intricate patterns of metonymy and synechdoche in <I>Nadja</I> point
to a notion of the feminine which is linked to cyclical temporality. We
have explored several forms of encirclement, cyclic return, and frozen
time in <I>Nadja</I>, including the tragic repetition compulsion of
Solange, a circular form psychosis; M. Delouit's more pathetic compulsion
to enact repeatedly his own effacement; the many song fragments (nursery
rhymes or chansons); the urban wandering of Nadja and Breton, or Breton's
own return to the places haunted by Nadja; and, at the comic level,
Brenton's account of the film <I>The</I> 

<B></B>


<I>Grip of the Octopus</I>, in which "a Chinese who had found
some way to multiply himself invaded New York by means of several
million self-reproductions," a work "which has affected me far more
than any other" (<I>N</I>, 32, 37/38). The image of Solange's skirt
"revealing a beautiful leg" (<I>N</I>, 45/49) in a frozen time is but
one expression of the <I>jouissance</I> which is linked to psychosis,
the <I>troubles de la pens&eacute;e</I> ("mental troubles") of Solange,
and the "crushing embrace" of the Place Dauphine. The grounding support
for these encirclings is the city, but the city conceived as maternal
imago. The city as feminine place acts as a protective or supporting
screen, enabling Breton to reconstruct an identity of sorts in his
confrontation with the effracting voice of trauma. Throughout "Soluble
Fish," the relationship between thinking and the substance of the feminine
is imagined as the interplay of light and shadow, while death is linked
to the primitive, archaic memory of the womb. The material is nearly
always linked to emergence and to place.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 It is well known that Breton did not care for music; but he shared
 with Val&eacute;ry a profound sense of the music of poetry, for what
 we hear in <I>Nadja</I> and its fragments is a highly chromatic music
 of the pathos of place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The kind of memory which is triggered by the song fragments moves
uneasily between the reorganization of a past characteristic of
<I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I>, that sort of retrospective interpretation
which stabilizes the past, and the unorganized timelessness which is the
<I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> of the unconscious. That oscillation
continues all the way to the end of the book, crystalized in the image
of the falling bridge and the nursery rhyme "Sur le pont d'Avignon"
to which Breton makes oblique reference (<I>N</I>, 154/182).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 When we see the extent to which identity, effraction, temporality,
 and death have been situated within <I>la substance du corp
 f&eacute;minin</I> (the substance of the female body), we can more fully
 appreciate the degree to which the canonic definition of Surrealism as
 "automatisme psychique pur" ("pure psychic automatism," "MoS," 26/328)
 has been shaped by that key category of nineteenth-century psychiatry
 in France, <I>troubles de la pens&eacute;e</I>, a term that covered
 general failures of attention. The pathology of <I>troubles de la
 pens&eacute;e</I> was always gendered feminine. In part of that move
 in which essentially Symbolist concerns are reinscribed within Freudian
 terms, Surrealism rejects the ideology behind the category <I>troubles
 de la pens&eacute;e</I>. But with Freud's meta-psychology it takes up,
 consciously and unconsciously, a way of exploring the experience of
 thought that could not evade either the matriciel dimension of place or
 the internal relations holding together movement, thought, temporality,
 and death. This is the level of the archaic which is glimpsed in the
 haunting silence of the construction in <I>Nadja</I>, in that radical
 experience of failure.

The difference between <I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> and

follows: <I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I> is an act of interpretation through
recovery that stabilizes form, the present-to-past in a reversibility,
the reconration of the past. It is well understood that such an
act of stabilization is not in principle permanent. <I>Pass&eacute;
anachronique</I>, the <I>Zeitlos</I> of the unconscious, on the

John Forrester, ibid. "Freud took the silence of the symbol just as he
took the silence of the transference, as creating a practical exigency:
the necessity of connection. But the symbol and the transference
phenomenon--the two occasions for silence-- lay at the opposite ends
of a spectrum: to find the <I>symbolic</I> connection a detour via
the most alien--alien to the patient-- associations, and very often,
as we shall see, via the most obscure linguistic forms, was found to be
necessary. Whereas, with the transference, what was required lay close

The verse "Un baiser est si vite oubli&eacute;" is, whether in
Surrealism or Cubism, a commonplace (<I>un lieu commun</I>). Its
fragmented presentation, like that of a banality, demands repetition as
a means of activation, as Breton observes in "MoS," 341. Banality is
not something to be overcome, but to be transformed within the key of
unsuspected potential.

It would require further argumentation to elaborate the Surrealist
attitude to the distinction between the maternal and the feminine. The
Surrealist attack on representations of the female body can be viewed as
an attack against the sign of woman-as-property under patriarchy. See

Breton's reference to a mental landscape that has a "remarkable extension
toward Avignon . . . where an old bridge has finally succumbed beneath a
nursery tune" refers to "Sur le pont d'Avignon," a French nursery rhyme
that has the structure of a round-song:
