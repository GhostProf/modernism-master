<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
The sea has a <i>voice</i>, which is very changeable and almost always
audible. It is a voice which sounds like a thousand voices, and much
has been attributed to it: patience, pain, and anger. But what is most
impressive about it is its persistence. The sea never sleeps; by day
and by night it makes itself heard, throughout the years and decades and
centuries. In its impetus and its rage it brings to mind the one entity
which shares these attributes in the same degree: that is, the crowd.

Elias Canetti, <i>Crowds and Power</i>
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>Rivista Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> was the lavish mass
distribution monthly to which subscribers of Italian Fascism's official
daily could turn for commentary on current events, literature, science,
culture and fashion, much like Americans could turn to <i>Life</i>
magazine, Russians could turn to <i>Soviet Life</i>, and the Chinese
to <i>China Reconstructs</i>. Starting sometime in the mid-1920s,
the <i>Rivista</i> underwent a graphic makeover. Among the innovations
introduced was the regular inclusion of large scale foldouts: panoramic
photographs, typically two to six times wider than the standard
page size. Foldouts in and of themselves were not uncommon in period
magazines and, as with contemporary foldouts of <i>Playboy</i> bunnies
or <i>Penthouse</i> pets, they were understood as special features,
graphic highlights detachable for purposes of exhibition in the home and
in the workplace. What first drew my attention to the <i>Rivista</i>'s
foldouts, however, was the object of desire draped across the picture
plane: teeming, seemingly infinite crowds rallying around a visible or
invisible leader, sometimes abstracted into an indistinct ocean of dots,
sometimes swarming with particulars; crowds wedged

<b></b>

into architectural settings representative of the great historical cities
of the Italian peninsula, crammed together to the point of driving out
all voids. The political rally as source of vicarious photo- and/or
pornographic thrill. Such was the graphic principle that would inform
the next fifteen years of the <i>Rivista Illustrata's</i> practice;
years during which wave after wave of innovative artists and graphic
designers laid out its pages: Bruno Munari, Mario Sironi, Fortunato
Depero, Gi&ograve; Ponti, Xanti Schawinsky. The graphic environment
shifted with each successive wave. But not the foldouts. Mass rally
after mass rally after mass rally unfolded in every number, right up to
the collapse of the Fascist regime and the review's demise.

<p>
The obvious reason for this persistence was the foldout's propaganda
value. The <i>Rivista</i> was much more than an Italian <i>Life</i>
magazine. It was a semi-official party organ. It set out to promote the
image of Fascism as a revolutionary movement and of Fascist Italy as a
perpetually mobilized nation. Yet the notion of propaganda raises more
questions than it answers. It tells one next to nothing about the nature
and the variety of the images placed in circulation or about the contours
of the socio-political imaginary which they hoped to tap into and to
shape. Nor does it address the larger question of where and how these
mass photographic panoramas fit into the broader stream of crowd images
that arises in European culture in the wake of the French Revolution,
a topic that has been addressed, though in a far from definitive manner,
by culture critics such as Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin and
art historians such as Wolfgang Kemp.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Last but not least, the invocation of a propagandistic function
 does not help one to understand how and why mass panoramas became
 intertwined with the art of photomontage and, with slight though
 significant variations, circulated not only in inter-war Italy,
 Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and the Soviet Union,
 but also in the postwar period from the Chinese Cultural Revolution
 up through the North Korea of Kim il Sung II.

<p>
So the topic of this essay is that literal specter of the Enlightenment
known as the revolutionary crowd, hovering between reason and
hallucination, between the emancipatory dreams of 1789 and the terror
of 1793, and the mass public's inscription as a graphic element within
modern political art and the new print-centered public sphere. The
process of inscription is not reducible to a single story line. Viewed
from the standpoint of artistic technique, it is the tale of an evolving
repertoire of, first, painterly and, then, photographic practices. Viewed
from an art-historical standpoint, it is the story of a complex of
differentiated but overlapping iconographies of the crowd, of their
place within the history of panoramic modes of representation, and of
their apparent ebb in the present cultural-historical moment. Viewed
from an intellectual-historical standpoint, it is the story of how these
practices and iconographies were influenced by millennium-long habits
of metaphorizing, gendering, and abstracting human crowds, central to
political philosophy at least as early as Aristotle and as late as
Elias Canetti; habits decisively altered by late eighteenth century
theorizations of the sublime. Viewed from a socio-political standpoint,
the story is that of the rise of a politics founded upon principles
of popular sovereignty and of the consequent need for new images and
mythologies of the collectivity as well as models of political action

<b></b>

and agency based upon the literal physical massing of bodies in public
spaces or the performance of symbolic marches and mobilizations in real
space and time.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 A multilayered tale, in short, as difficult to contain within the
 bounds of a single essay as are the oceanic masses enframed within the
 foldouts of the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>. All this by way of an apology
 for the schematic character of the following narrative, a narrative
 that will lead the reader on a series of suggestive rather than
 exhaustive zigzags through the analytical strata just described. The
 stopping points in the narrative bear the subtitles: "Tides," "Types,"
 "Tiles" and "Spillways<i>." "</i>Tides" concerns the oceanic metaphor
 as applied to crowds. "Types" sketches out the history of what will
 be referred to as "emblematic" crowd images. "Tiles" describes the
 development of "oceanic" mass panoramas with respect to the prior
 emblematic tradition. "Spillways" deals with the transformation of
 "oceanic" fragments back into geometrical emblems within the context
 of modernist photomontage, while reflecting briefly on the possibility
 that rallying multitudes no longer serve as the pillar upon which are
 built contemporary models of political action.

<p>
The phrase <i>la folla oceanica</i> (the oceanic mass) was the label
applied both by viewers and producers to the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>
foldouts. The phrase is ubiquitous in early twentieth century Italian
political discourse, whether nationalist, socialist, or anarchist. But
nowhere more so than in Fascist oratory where it served to enforce
Fascism's claim that it alone knew how to catalyze and to channel
the mighty and mysterious forces that characterized the <i>era of
crowds</i>. The "era of crowds" was the definition of modernity proposed
in Gustave Le Bon's 1895 classic, <i>Psychologie des foules</i> and
in the works of crowd psychology that influenced it by authors such as
Taine and Tarde, as well as by members of the Italian Positivist school
(Ferri, Lombroso, Sighele, Rossi). Le Bon affirmed: "While all our
ancient beliefs are tottering and disappearing, while the old pillars
of society are giving way one by one, the power of the crowd is the only
force that nothing menaces, and of which the prestige is continually on
the increase."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Premodern multitudes had long been imagined as elemental hordes to be
 shaped and subjugated from on high; modern multitudes were the volatile
 protagonists of a volatile era, leaders themselves as well as breeding
 grounds for new forms of leadership and individualism. Nothing menaced
 their power because of an inherent heterogeneity and instability:
 they were the result of the promiscuous intermingling and physical
 massing of social classes, age groups, races, nationalities, and
 genders along the great boulevards of the industrial metropolis. Their
 prestige was continually on the increase because everything modern was
 potentially at their beck and call: political authority, the state,
 commerce, communications, culture, economic production. Brought into
 being thanks to the loss of conscious personality that was purported to
 occur when human bodies agglomerate, the modern crowd is not reducible
 to the average of the individuals that make it up, but rather sets off
 a chain reaction like those that fascinated Le Bon in his writings on
 atomic particles: "just as in chemistry certain elements,

<b></b>

when brought into contact&#8212;bases and acids, for
example&#8212;combine to form a new body possessing properties quite
different from those of the bodies that have served to form it," so it
is with the crowd.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 His socialist counterpart Ferri shared the same thought:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Collective psychology concerns not the simple mixing of individual
elements, but rather their chemical combination. This means that the
resulting psychic collective is not equal to the sum of its individual
psychic parts (and this is the case both on the plane of feelings and that
of ideas). On the contrary, it is always different, either for the better
or for the worse, in precisely the same manner as a chemical combination
of two or more substances confers upon the final mass a temperature that
is higher or lower than that of the bodies that make it up.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The properties in question are the result of multiple liquids combined in
a single test tube always with an uncertain outcome: a new substance,
an explosion, a surge of energy, accelerated decay, a fizzle, new
fermentations.

<p>
In <i>Psychologie des foules</i> Le Bon rarely assimilates the modern
mob to tides, open seas or ocean storms, but he did not need to. The
association was firmly established in the Western socio-political
imagination long before the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts were
routinely imagined as portraits of human oceans and long before Scipio
Sighele probed the criminal crowd as a "perilous sea . . . whose surfaces
are whipped up by every psychological wind."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 This is attested to in a wide array of nineteenth century literary
 sources. Early instances are Wordsworth's perception of London as a
 "perpetual flow / Of trivial objects, melted and reduced / To one
 identity by differences / That have no law, no meaning, and no end
 . . ." and De Quincey's hallucinatory vision of the London cityscape as
 an ocean "paved with innumerable faces, upturned to the heavens: faces,
 imploring, wrathful, despairing, surg[ing]; upwards by the thousands,
 by myriads, by generations, by centuries . . ."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Other accounts are less nightmarish, like "the tumultuous sea of human
 heads" that fills the narrator of Poe's <i>Man of the Crowd</i> with
 "a delicious novelty of emotion" and Baudelaire's seminal writings
 on the industrial metropolis, where modern individualism is made to
 hinge upon a dandy-bather navigating his way through aquatic multitudes.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The metaphor has become a constant by the end of the nineteenth century,
 shaping everything from Zola and Huysman's evocations of spectral urban
 (Paris) and rural (Lourdes) crowds to Maupassant's &eacute;litist
 reflections in <i>Sur l'Eau</i> on how individual wills blend with the
 common will like "a drop of water is blended with and lost in a river"
 to the promise lodged at the climax of the 1909 Founding Manifesto
 of Futurism that futurists will "sing the multicolored and polyphonic
 tidal waves of revolution in modern capitals . . ."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
The "oceanic crowd" is, in point of fact, far more ancient, traceable at
least as far back as the longstanding conflation in Greco-Roman culture
of <i>turbulence</i>, whether maritime, meteorological, or political,
with the <i>turba</i> which is to say, the mob. The pairing animates
much of ancient political theory as, for example, the characteristic
passage in Cicero's <i>De re publica</i>, where he asserts that "there
is no sea so hard to calm and no fire so hard to check as the vengeance
of the unrestrained mob."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 (Better,

<b></b>

accordingly, to build cities destined for permanence and imperial might,
like Athens and Rome, at a remove from the ocean and its proletarian
tides.)
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 The re recurs in a celebrated simile from the opening book of
 Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And just as, often, when a crowd of people
<br />
Is rocked by a rebellion, and the rabble (<i>ignobilevulgus</i>)
<br />
Rage in their minds, and firebrands and stones
<br />
Fly fast&#8212;for fury finds its weapons&#8212;if,
<br />
By chance, they see a man remarkable
<br />
For righteousness and service, they are silent
<br />
And stand attentively; and he controls
<br />
Their passion by his words and cools their spirits:
<br />
So all the clamor of the sea subsided. . .
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In ancient thought, the man "remarkable for righteousness and service"
(<i>pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum</i>), the queller of
revolutionary tumults and navigator of stormy seas, the <i>gubernator</i>,
is radically unlike, radically "other" to the always feminized rabble. He
is a godlike being like the goddess-born hero of Virgil's epic, <i>pius
Aeneas</i>; a subduer of his passions and the passions of others,
not a fomenter. Le Bon and his Italian counterparts are well aware
that what changes in the era of industry is less the volatility of the
crowd or a newly favorable characterization of this volatility than the
lineage of this superior being. No longer the monarch, the aristocrat,
or the godlike man; no longer the tyrant imagined as the rabble's
monstrous counterpart; he is the man of the crowd: at once immanent
and transcendent, at once an insider and an outsider, at once everyman
and the exceptional individual who provides the masses with a singular
identity, a singular face, a mirror image of a sovereign collectivity that
is now always in motion (in motion, because, in conflict with classical
political theory, motion&#8212;not stasis&#8212;has become the normative
state of healthy collectivities). Fully swept up in the multicolored
and polyphonic waves of modern revolution, he is able to channel
their tidal fury towards higher and nobler ends: national sovereignty,
liberty, empire, progress. An early name of his is Leviathan, as famously
red in the 1651 frontispiece illustrating the Hobbesian principle of
contractual political representation according to which the sovereign is
simultaneously understood as the power that forces individual citizens
into a single body politic and as the expression of their collective will.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 (<a name="1" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The
 body of citizens that composes Leviathan's body, what Herbert Spencer
 referred to as the <i>macanthrope</i>, is made up of the natural motions
 of individual minds whose interaction gives rise to an ideal collective
 motion signaled by a reciprocal exchange of gazes. The multitude faces
 its own face and vice versa in an act of mirroring that allows for
 no fundamental ontological gap between leader and led. This orderly
 model of the formation of the body politic will provide one of the
 richest veins for mass panoramic representations of the type that I
 will subsequently refer to as the <i>emblematic</i>. The emblematic
 mass so pervades the history of Western group portraiture until the
 modern era that exceptions are usually limited to battlefield scenes
 (Paolo Uccello's <i>Battle of San Romano</i>) or to representations
 of the unruly damned being herded by infernal

<b></b>

taskmasters. What prevails instead are the geometrically arrayed choirs
that surround the Redeemer in vast tableaux of total order like Fra
Angelico's <i>Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven</i> and Giotto's
Arena Chapel <i>Last Judgment</i>, along with secular avatars. The
emblematic mass is but the tradition bound, dry land counterpart of
the <i>oceanic</i> mass and to set sail on the latter, a more dynamic
cognitive model is required that would allow the sovereign individual
to emerge while being immersed in the mob, to control while being
controlled. The model in question is provided by theorizations of the
sublime.

<p>
Oceanic imagery proliferates in treatises on the sublime no less than it
does in ancient political theory. Already in Longinus, the <i>Iliad</i>
was sublime because of "the flood of moving incidents in quick succession,
the versatile rapidity and actuality, brimful of images drawn from real
life," whereas in the far less sublime <i>Odyssey</i>, it is as if "the
ocean had shrunk into its lair and lay becalmed within its own confines."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 In Addison, Burke and especially Kant, the ocean is the horizontal
 counterpart to the vertical mountainscapes that precipitate in
 the viewer a simultaneous sense of vertigo and of its overcoming,
 of control and loss of control, of thrill and an expanded sense of
 selfhood. In the contemplation of vast, formless, seemingly infinite
 objects in nature, a mental movement is initiated that allows us "to
 see sublimity in the ocean, regarding it, as the poets do, according
 to what the impression upon the eye reveals, as let us say, in its
 calm, a clear mirror of water bounded only by the heavens, or, be it
 disturbed, as threatening to overwhelm and engulf everything."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 The scene's excess with respect to the imagination's ability to
 comprehend the whole renders a plunge into the abyss inevitable:
 "the boundless ocean rising with rebellious force, the high waterfall
 of some mighty river and the like, make our power of resistance of
 trifling moment in comparison

<b></b>

with their might" (<i>COJ</i>, 110). Yet the plunge is productive because
it is controlled: "provided our own position is secure, their aspect
is all the more attractive for its fearfulness . . ." (<i>COJ</i>,
110). Kant's proviso regarding the need for a secure perch as a
precondition for experiencing the sublime will come under increasing
pressure in the course of the nineteenth century, but the key point
here is the convergence between the Ciceronian-Virgilian revolutionary
<i>turba</i> and a new theorization of land- and seascapes.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Nineteenth century culture will turn out large numbers of panoramic
 images of natural landscapes. It will also turn out large numbers of
 calm and disturbed seascapes. Last but not least, it will give rise
 to a new iconography of human oceanscapes within the framework of the
 political sublime.

<p>
As already indicated, the field of modern mass panoramas appears evenly
split between emblematic and oceanic representations. My case study for
the former will be the photographic tableaux of the turn-of-the-century
American evangelical/military photographer Arthur S. Mole; my case study
for the latter will be the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts.

<p>
Born in 1889, Mole was a follower of the faith healer John Alexander
Dowie, founder of the Christian Catholic Church, whose fiery brand of
evangelism informed a number of early mass photographic experiments
seemingly extending back to the time of the foundation in 1901 of Zion,
Illinois.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Zion was established as a Christian utopia, combining revivalism
 with millenarianism, industry with piety, proselytizing via the
 media&#8212;the Church's illustrated weekly newspaper, <i>Leaves of
 Healing</i>, was distributed world-wide&#8212;with the elaboration of
 mass spectacles including an annual Passion Play. The city included
 the Zion Lace Factory (brought over from Nottingham, England),
 baking and candy factories, a printing and publishing house (and,
 later, a radio station)&#8212;like everything else in Zion, owned by
 the Church&#8212;and a tabernacle large enough to hold ten thousand
 faithful.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Within the setting of this evangelical community, mass panoramic
 photography assumed a role right from the start to judge by the fact
 that in July 1904 the noted Chicago panoramicist George R. Lawrence
 was hired to document a series of parades, prayer meetings, and
 consecrations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Mole's work built upon Lawrence's legacy. His earliest mass photographic
experiments were collective portraits, bearing titles such as "The Cross
and the Crown" and "The Zion Shield" or spelling out Biblical quotations,
staged with members of the congregation during the years immediately
preceding and following the outbreak of World War I.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It appears that the resulting photographs were published in <i>Leaves
 of Healing</i> and/or sold to the sitters and to outsiders, with
 profits going to the church. Two characteristic examples of Mole's
 work are "The Nine O'Clock Hour of Prayer or the Living Clock" 
 and "The Reverend John Alexander Dowie" . (<a name="2"
 href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 2</a>) The first marks
 the Christian Catholics' practice, inspired in turn by Roman
 Catholic monastic practice, of interrupting the day at dawn and
 dusk&#8212;conventionally designated

<b></b>

as the ninth hour or nones&#8212;with a minute of prayer and
meditation. The clock is "living" thus not only inasmuch as a mechanical
artifact is brought to life by being embodied by the members of the
congregation, but also inasmuch as time is sacralized by the hour of
prayer, transformed into the time well spent that leads to salvation
and eternal life. The second celebrates the 21st anniversary of the
consecration of the Christian Catholic Church's tabernacle and city
(Zion) by means of a "living" portrait that combines human bodies with
stage props.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 In between these pious compositions, Mole turned to military
 photography, working in close collaboration with John D. Thomas, the
 leader of the Zion White Robed Choir, who became his crowd manager
 and producer. Together they turned out dozens of photographs, most
 commissioned by specific battalions and sold to battalion members,
 such as "The Living American Flag" (1917; 10,000 sitters), "The Human
 Statue of Liberty" (1918; 18,000 sitters); "The Living Liberty Bell"
 (1918; 25,000 sitters), "The Living Uncle Sam" (1919; 19,000 sitters),
 "The Human U.S. Shield" (1918; 30,000 sitters), and their famous
 portrait of Woodrow Wilson (1918; 21,000 sitters). (<a name="3"
 href="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 3</a>) By the end of the war,
 Mole and Thomas's success was such that they very nearly persuaded
 the American armed services to permit them to cross the Atlantic so
 as to shoot the most massive living portrait ever assembled: a clock
 marking the eleventh hour, portrayed by the <i>entirety</i> of the
 American armed forces stationed in Europe.

<p>
The technique developed by Mole for purposes of these mass compositions
was ingenious and based upon aerial surveying practices. A 70-80
foot tower was rigged up out of two by fours and steadied by means of
cables. Once he was atop the tower, armed with an oversized 11-14-inch
view camera mounted to the tower's flank, Mole would superimpose
a transparency bearing an image over the camera's ground glass
plate&#8212;inverting the drafting process employed with the camera
obscura&#8212;and then proceed to bark out orders via a megaphone to a
ground crew, directed by Thomas, whose job it was to mark out the image
across the landscape. (When the distances

<b></b>

involved were beyond the megaphone's range, a white flag was used for
signaling.) The tableau was to appear undistorted, as if level with the
picture plane, which meant both extreme, anamorphic-type distortions
on the ground and visual torsion between the receding landscape in the
backdrop (usually barracks) and an emblem that always looks as if it were
standing straight up. (In the case of the Wilson portrait, for instance, a
mere hundred soldiers were required for the president's shoulder region as
contrasted with the several thousand who make up the top of his head.) Up
to a week of preparatory work was required to survey the landscape,
trace sitter positions, and make calculations regarding the exact number
of soldiers required and their distribution according to hat and uniform
types. The actual shoot consisted in a literal close-order military drill,
requiring long periods of standing at attention in precise formation.

<p>
Mole's technique may have been novel, but his compositions were
not. Various branches of the armed services and, in particular, members
of veteran groups such as the Grand Army of the Republic, had been
composing living flags, inscriptions, and symbols in athletic stadiums
and on marching grounds at least as early as the final decades of the
nineteenth century. Other photographers, such as Simes and Campbell
and Eugene O. Goldbeck, also found a highly profitable niche market
in battalion portraiture. Nor were such compositions original in the
deeper sense that, like Abraham Bosse's <i>Leviathan</i> frontispiece,
they tap into a millennium of prior images&#8212;political,

<b></b>

metaphysical, theological--fusing the many and the one. This vast image
bank of idealized crowds&#8212;angels, saints, martyrs&#8212;arrayed as
signs encompasses to varying degrees acrostic and pattern poetry from
Porphyry to Rabanus Maurus to George Herbert to actual Renaissance
hieroglyphs; rations of celestial choirs in Last Judgment
scenes; and the Christian chiliastic imaginary with its last signs
and emblems of the faithful becoming one with and within the body of
Christ. A case in point is Dante's <i>Paradise</i> with its kinetic
skywriting(illustrated by Dante's near contemporary, Giovanni di Paolo)
and its succession of symbols formed by the blessed&#8212;circles, cross,
eagle, and ladder&#8212;that lead the way to a face-to-face vision of
God and the Holy Jerusalem. The jump from holy to secular athletes,
martyrs to soldiers, angels to Tiller Girls, formations in heaven to
military parades, political rallies or football halftime shows, is easy
to accomplish. However seemingly distant from the scene of the modern
era of crowds, the same transcendental imaginary continues to shape
secular utopias. Consider the case of someone aesthetically distant
from Mole's "living" clocks: L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus
professor and the author in 1925 both of conventional photojournalistic
oceanic crowd scenes like "Up with the United Front," shot in order
to celebrate a Berlin Factory Workers Association demonstration, as
well as of the "Dream of the Boarding School Girls." (<a name="4"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#4"> 4</a>) The latter photomontage
shows how, in the spirit of Von Laban's eurhythmics and various
other group sports-hygiene-biomechanics movements, the bodies of
dancers and athletes are released from the laws of gravitation and
this release is placed along the path of a group of schoolgirls,
arrayed in a receding H formation (perhaps the initial of their
boarding school). The dreamed-of passage from one geometry, a more
restrictive one associated with the regime of acquiring literacy,
to another, associated with enticing new erotic-machinic geometries,
is not out of line with Arthur Mole's twenty-one thousand soldiers
cast in the image of Woodrow Wilson. Certainly no more so than are El
Lissitzky's 1931 photogram of Lenin and its Fascist twin, the 1934
<i>One Heart Alone</i> referendum poster in which the mob provides
a receding ground for Mussolini's profile. (. <a name="5"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#5">5</a> and <a name="6"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#6">6</a>) (Though there are differences
between Mole's representationalism and Moholy's abstractionism, as well
as between the sheer frontality of Lissitzky's Lenin and the lateral
exchange of gazes staged in <i>One Heart Alone</i>.) The same would go
for Fascist, Communist and liberal-democratic experiments with everything
from mass gymnastic exhibitions to "living writing" to stadium flip-card
shows to the mass dance drills of Busby Berkeley. The Holy Jerusalem may
be located in Leningrad, Rome, Mao's China, Hollywood or Zion, Illinois,
but the formal principle as well as its ideological underpinnings remain
analogous: out of the multitude emerges the face of the leader, the logos,
the hieroglyph, the crux, in what is at once an allegory of collective
transcendence and a trans-cultural form of play.

<p>
To underscore the continuities between pre-modern and modern emblematic
representations of the crowd is not to overlook obvious divergences,
like the increasing interest among post-1789 artists in panoramic modes
of representation; shifts in perspective, medium, and scale; variations
in the semiological status of emblems themselves. My aim, rather, has
been to establish the simultaneous existence of old emblematic practices
with the new oceanic ones, so as to suggest that the one

<b></b>

interpenetrates the other. For all their formal divergences and
differences in use, procedure, and location, for all the seeming (and
illusory) absence of emblematic artifice in oceanic crowd scenes, both
the emblematic and the oceanic are reducible, in the end, to allegories
of crowd control. They serve as dialectical counterparts of one another,
the first emphasizing the moment of transcendence when the one emerges
out of the many; and the second emphasizing the moment of immanence in
which the one taps into the tidal power of the multitudes.

<p>
But if these are images of crowd control, what is the nature and degree of
the control in question? What are the precise techniques by means of which
a head is placed on the otherwise headless mob? And what are the formal,
technological, and ideological variables involved? In the case of the
<i>Rivista Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> foldouts, an adequate answer
requires a look back at the earlier history of panoramas. Understood in
the strictest sense, the word "panorama," of course, refers to 360 degree
representations. The term and device were patented by their inventor,
the Irishman Robert Barker, to promote an "IMPROVEMENT ON PAINTING, Which
relieves that sublime Art from a Restraint it has ever labored under."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Such relief began its transformation into a mass phenomenon with the
 opening in London on 14 March, 1789, of "Mr. Barker's Interesting and
 Novel View of the City and Castle of Edinburgh, and the Whole Adjacent
 and Surrounding Country." Enormously successful both with elite and
 popular audiences, the show quickly gave rise to imitations. Within
 a few years similar panoramas were touring France, Germany, and the
 United States; within decades they would span the world. Barker's
 original patent meticulously details the various lighting techniques,
 ventilation systems, and pictorial techniques that are required in
 order to make the viewer feel "as if he is really on the very spot."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 The illusion was enforced by restricting the viewer's bodily position
 and movement to the center of the rotunda and screening his view of the
 upper and lower edges. Barker had little to say about the elaboration
 of the circular image, but subsequent documentation shows that it
 was based upon segmentation or "tiling." A camera obscura or similar
 framing device would be positioned at a fixed location and rotated such
 that drawings could be generated one frame at a time. The resulting
 frames would then have to be smoothed together by the artist so as to
 create an illusion of a seamless whole, with adjustments made so as
 to project straight lines from frame to frame along the curved surface
 of the canvas.

<p>
A few points need to be highlighted regarding the panorama's history,
for they carry over directly to panoramic photography. Intended as a
method for emancipating painting&#8212;read "early photography"&#8212;by
way of rendering it an even more sublime art, the panorama set out to
wed an unbounded new sort of sublimity with an unbounded new sort of
realism. Through the combination of the two, the spectator was to find
himself transported directly to "the very spot" of observation, which
usually meant somewhere else, somewhere other, somewhere novel&#8212;like
Edinburgh seen from on high viewed in downtown London, or London
itself viewed from some astounding new angle. The spot in question,
in other words, was precisely the sort of elevated, dislocated perch
that Kant would have demanded for secure experiences of the vertigo,
terror, and excitement that accompany the viewing of seemingly formless,
infinite, and overpowering, natural objects. Early panoramas rose to the
double challenge of infusing what the era understood as hyperrealism with
sensations of thrill and transport through recourse to vertiginous bird's
eye perspectives, whether of cityscapes, as in Joshua Atkinson's 1807 view
of Saint Petersburg and an anonymous 1845 anamorphic view of London, or of
mountainscapes like that of Loch Lomond, Scotland, painted for exhibition
in London by John Knox in 1810. Cityscapes and mountainscapes would long

<b></b>

remain the standard panoramic fare, but they were soon flanked by scenes
of exotic landscapes, fires, explosions, and disasters at sea (as in the
works of the Austrian painter Hubert Sattler, whose "Storm in the North
Sea" was considered the masterpiece of his London 1824 <i>Cosmorama</i>
because, "sublime beyond description," it was "so perfect and true to
nature it almost made one shudder"
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
); as well as by the great land and sea battles of world history:
Aboukir, Ostende, Agincourt, Moscow and, last but hardly least, Waterloo,
as illustrated by Louis Dumoulin's immense turn-of-the-twentieth century
<i>Panorame de la bataille de Waterloo</i>.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Tourism, flight and fright; hallucination; the promise or threat
 of accident; oscillation between a sense of expanded selfhood made
 available through access to an all-encompassing gaze and a sense of
 selfhood endangered because being encircled and engulfed; illusory
 participation in history's most dramatic events; estrangement of the
 familiar: panoramas traded in these pleasures and others, only to
 be overrun by a medium that represented yet another "improvement on
 painting": photography.

<p>
The very fact that panoramas were built up out of segmented frames drawn
up by turning about a fixed axis made the shift over to photography a
natural. Yet there were obstacles. Standard daguerreotype plate formats
remained too small to achieve effects "sublime beyond description." And
there was the question of how to smooth out transitions between frames due
to the distortions introduced by the camera lens, particularly towards
the edges of wide-angle images. The solution lay in the use of oversize
cameras and in a modified tiling or montage procedure.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 One early pioneer was George N. Bernard who produced panoramic surveys
 of battlefields for the Union Army during the American Civil War,
 making use of multiple wet-plate glass negatives, assembled into single
 images in his studio by means of cropping and trimming.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Another innovator, as in so many other domains, was Edward Muybridge. In
 1877 Muybridge carried an enormous custom camera up to the top
 of California Street Hill and shot the second expanded version of
 his famous 360 degree <i>Panorama of San Francisco</i>, composed of
 thirteen panels, each 20.5-by-16-inches in size, adding up to a total
 length of seventeen feet.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Muybridge's practice was to shoot his images with enough overlap so
 that, by means of cropping an inch and a half vertically and two inches
 horizontally, distortions could be limited and the individual panels
 could be bled into one another so as to seem more or less continuous.

<p>
I must confess that when I first became intrigued by the <i>Rivista
Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> foldouts, I assumed that these
painterly and photographic precedents, from Barker to Muybridge, had been
largely superseded by the development and commercial production at the
end of the nineteenth century of swing-lens cameras (like the Al-Vista,
whose lens wheeled around 180 degrees while the film and camera body
were held still) and rotational cameras (like the Cirkut, in which the
entire camera wheeled in one direction, while the film turned in another).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Devised to feed the public's seemingly unlimited hunger for Alpine
 scenes, city views, battle scenes, and pictures of military assemblies,
 such panoramic images were a favorite for stereopticons and similar
 optical devices. So I red that Fascist era press photographers
 had simply embraced these new tools, shifting the content from sublime
 mountainscapes

<b></b>

to sublime multitudes. This seemed to explain why, like stereopticon
photos, their output was rarely panoramic in the strict 360 degree sense
and why the images themselves were so meticulously turned out that an
untrained eye struggles in vain to locate crop marks or distortions
of the sort that abound in Bernard and Muybridge. Close study of the
actual photographs and a visit to the Luce Archive in Rome revealed
these assumptions to be false. On the contrary, I discovered that there
exists a direct genealogical link between the painted panoramas of the
nineteenth century and the mass panoramic foldouts. Far from representing
just an urban counterpart to rural landscape photography, the latter
are actually works of what is perhaps best labeled "documentarist
photomontage": photomontage deployed in the service of enhancing the
reality effect, which means the thrill effect, that can be achieved by
means of conventional press photography. Just as panoramic painting sought
to relieve the sublime art of painting of certain restraints seemingly
inherent to painting as a medium, so mass panoramic photography seeks to
relieve photojournalism of certain prosaic obligations and sets out to
transport the viewer right to the very event. In the process of doing so,
it deploys a battery of techniques to structure a particular experience of
the event and to characterize the event itself as providing an opportunity
for secular communion. Mass panoramic photographs, in short, are trick
"realist" photographs, tiled and smoothed together just like their
nineteenth century ancestors, but juiced up by means of photomontage
and other forms of visual sleight of hand.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The earliest of the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> photographs date from
November, 1926. Some,like the stadium scene of a Fascist rally in
Bologna, hint at their ancestry, bearing the legend: "The photograph
represents only one sector of the Lictorial stadium as is evident
when you consider the stadium's elliptical form" ("La fotografia non
rappresenta che <i>un</i> settore del Littoriale come &egrave; evidente
quando si considera la forma elittica"); an invitation for the spectator
to imagine the image as if it followed the curvature of the stands,
potentially all the way around the entire ellipse. Later images, like a
September 1937 six-panel image of a rally in Sicily, play upon the very
same sense of curvature to intensify the sense of grandeur and boundless
space. (<a name="7" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
The dictator is thrust out into the picture plane on a prow-like
geometrical podium coursing across a seemingly infinite human ocean
that gives way, in turn, to a literal sea. Nested in the image
is the dictator's double, the cameraman. The man with a camera
is a standard feature of Italian mass panoramas. (<a name="8"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 8</a>) A literal man of the
crowd, the cameraman's immersion in the mob represents a guarantee
of closeness and susceptibility to its tidal surges. But he is also
always already high on the podium, hovering above. His is a hybrid
perspective merging a god's eye, overhead perspective with the view
from the ground. Which is to say that, like the dictator, the cameraman
must also be understood as a catalyst of revolutionary surges. He does
not simply reproduce tidal flows, but rather <i>produces</i> them just
like the dictator-demiurge who is at once immanent and transcendent with
respect to the masses.

<p>
The productive (as contrasted with the <i>re-</i>productive) work of the
photographer begins with the choice of an elevated orthogonal perspective
like that long before perfected by panorama painters, a case in point
being the June 1930 eight-panel foldout of a mass rally in Milan. (<A
NAME="9" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#9"> 9</a>) Here one
is dealing with a true example of an oceanic-type

<b></b>

image, not only tiled together in the conventional manner,
but also composed like a photo-mosaic, in which the masses appear
everywhere and the leader nowhere. As anyone who has ever visited
Milan's Piazza del Duomo can readily attest, the perspective that it
offers is a highly artificial construction, closer to a Byzantine than
a single-point perspectival scheme. The square has been wedged open,
transformed into a trapezoid, splayed so as to create the illusion of a
vaster architectural setting and, therefore, of a vaster human ocean: an
illusion not of <i>enhanced</i> but of <i>compressed</i> depth inasmuch
as the buildings have been rotated off the central pictorial axis in
the process of expanding the horizon line and the entire backdrop of
the image has been pulled forward toward the surface of the picture
plane. The ultimate effect of the

<b></b>

visual splay is paradoxical in a way that typifies the genre. On the one
hand, it creates a sense of closeness and impending encroachment, as if
the cityscape were opening up to enfold the viewer within the crowd's
surge. On the other, it raises the viewer above and beyond the crowd,
to an elevated perch, perhaps so elevated as to identify the panoramic
camera eye with the gaze of il Duce.

<p>
This precise repertory of perspectival and editing
techniques&#8212;tiling, cropping, cutting, pasting, masking, even
airbrushing&#8212;was refined over the course of the following decade. It
in no way pre-empted recourse to other sorts of sublime crowd imagery,
whether to diagonally angled Soviet-style single frames, emblematic mass
sporting scenes, parading soldiers disappearing into sunbursts<b>,</b>
mass images of specific sub-crowds&#8212;mass accordionists, mass
sportsmen and women, mass regional groups dressed in traditional folk
costumes. But its most characteristic products remain panoramas like the
photo-mosaic of Hitler's May 1938 visit to Naples: a composite image
of the Piazza del Plebiscito fabricated out of at least five separate
photographs. (. <a href="9.2schnapp_res.html#0" name="0">10-14</a>) As revealed by a close inspection of the
component "tiles," what has been

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 262]</b>

edited out of the image are a series of "distractions": gaps in the
crowd, electrical cables rising up to the top of the various lighting
and loudspeaker towers, military groups parading at opposite ends of the
Piazza, a fleet of destroyers shrouded in the mist of the Bay of Naples.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 The square itself has once again been pried open so as to strengthen
 the feeling of density and sprawl, while pulling the horizon line
 forward. Every graphic feature of the image has been manipulated to
 enhance the exclusive focus on the masses, on their energy, their power
 and potential heroism, their sense of expectation. But expectation of
 what? Or to frame the question otherwise, what is it that ensures that
 this particular oceanic mass provides a sublime rather than nightmarish
 viewing experience or that the masses in question will be recognized
 as potential agents of national redemption rather than as a lawless
 destructive horde? The question might well be asked of every one of
 the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts. The answer involves not only
 the careful juggling of visual proximity and distance, horizontality

<b></b>

and verticality, played out by means of camera placement and cropping
practices that identify the camera eye itself with or as an external
ordering agent, as a kind of deus ex machina, like the leader himself;
but also two other factors: first, a set of internal "content controls";
second, a set of strategies of contextualization.

<p>
In the case of the first&#8212;i.e. the internal "content"
controls&#8212;the crowds depicted in the <i>Rivista</i> foldouts are
tightly choreographed. Not as tightly choreographed as the Rockettes
or as Mole's Christian Catholic congregations, but spontaneous only in
part. They typically brought together ordinary citizens with elements
from the Fascist youth, after-work, and trade groups, bussed in from
throughout the provinces so as to ensure a full and enthusiastic house. In
their midst circulated preprinted placards and rally coordinators ready
to cheerlead a pre-established repertoire of chants at the appropriate
cue. Also in their midst circulated members of the secret police,
invisible agents of surveillance and control paired with more visible
agents like the Luce cameramen. But the frequent presence of uniformed
members of the Militia, army and National Fascist Party is perhaps more
significant because it calls attention to the intimate connection between
emblematic and oceanic crowd images. In many images, these disciplined
crowds within the crowd, arrayed in the form of rectangles, squares, and
Fascist axe blades, interpenetrate the oceanic mass so as to hint at the
translatability of the one into the other. Perhaps it's just a matter of
time before everyone joins a formation and wears a uniform; perhaps it's
simply a matter of differing degrees of mobilization and ideological
commitment. Whatever the case may be, there is an emblem buried in
every oceanic representation. Sometimes it floats to the surface as in
the case of a September 1938 photo-mosaic from Padua. (<a name="5"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#5"> 15</a>) Sometimes it is buried
so deeply that its contours merge with those of the picture itself.

<p>
In the specific case of Fascist mass panoramas, the emblem in question,
whether a buried hatchet or the visage of il Duce, is characterized
by the fact that the mass choreographies rarely occur on a naked
stage. Architectural settings&#8212;Roman ruins, Renaissance and Baroque
palaces, Risorgimento squares&#8212;remind the viewer that the crowd
portrayed is not the timeless, placeless, faceless socialist crowd
rallying around abstract principles, but rather a <i>national</i> crowd,
shaped by a national sense of place, race and tradition, and rallying
around principles delimited by time and space. These architectures
from the past are brought into the present by means of banners. On the
occasion of the Naples 1938 rally, the banners, flags, towers, indeed,
the mass rally itself, all bespeak of the imminent appearance of two
leaders, planned for nightfall, at which time the Piazza del Plebiscito
was transformed into a Fascist phantasmagoria.

<p>
Earlier allusion was made to "strategies of contextualization" and it is
to these that I now turn inasmuch as they represent perhaps the single
most innovative development vis-&agrave;-vis the panoramic tradition and
the one of greatest potential interest for the history of photomontage
and the documentarist aesthetic of the 1920s and 1930s. The panoramas of
the prior century were meant to be experienced as autonomous artifacts,
hyperreal in their effect but spatially and temporally dislocated from,
and dislocating of, their viewing context. The <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>
foldouts, on the contrary, find themselves increasingly woven into a
thickly layered, "crowded" graphic environment

<b></b>

where crowd imagery interacts with images of the leader, experimental
typography, photomontages, drawings, and cartoons, always in meticulously
assembled sequences. On the one hand, this graphic thickness has a
symbolic purpose: that of casting the image of the masses in the image
of the leader and/or the state and vice versa as if the former, like
Baudelaire's dandy, were "a mirror as vast as the crowd itself."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 (<a name="6" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#6"> 16</a>) By
 means of a sustained visual dialogue, that is, the one is constantly
 presented as the inevitable counterpart of the other. On the other hand,
 the layering introduces a new dimension to panoramic representations,
 removing yet another "restraint" upon their potential sublime
 effect. That dimension is temporality: temporality in the double sense
 of narrative sequence and simultaneity. Much as in period newsreels,
 mass panoramas are increasingly framed as the climax that follows a
 step-by-step process of regional and/or national mobilization; a process
 that by definition involves simultaneous motion from a multiplicity
 of locations towards a single site, the site of the rally: a motion
 charted in photomontages and image sequences that, as if the tiles out
 of which the eventual photo-mosaic will be composed, are often times
 first presented serially, and then combined in a final triumphal vision
 in which all of these images and moments are seamlessly folded into the
 totality that is the mass panorama itself&#8212;a totality presumably
 meant to enfold the viewer in the moment of viewing. In other cases,
 the mass panorama appears earlier or even at the beginning of the
 sequence, as if its graphic hub or source.

<p>
I will now take the reader very quickly through two of the latter
sorts of sequences. The first dates from October, 1932, and crosscuts
the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome with
statistical data in a succession of images that leads from Fascism's
past to its future. The sequence runs:

<p>
1) the celebration of Fascism's Milanese origins and
of its martyrs on 16 October, 1932 (<a name="7"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 17</a>);

<p>
2) a panoramic representation of Fascism's present in the form of
a mass rally in Rome's Piazza Venezia, under the aegis of Mussolini
(who has been cropped out of the upper middle portion of the picture)
(<a name="8" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 18</a>);

<p>
3) the growth of the National Fascist Party, as marked
by its 1.7 million members on the march (<a name="9"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#9"> 19</a>);

<p>
4) the formation and growth of the Fascist Militia (Voluntary Militia for
National Security), the mechanism by means of which Mussolini brought
discipline to and regimented the most militant squadrist elements (<A
NAME="0" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#0"> 20</a>);

<b></b>

<p>
5) the nationwide proliferation of Fascist youth groups (Piccole
Italiane, Avanguardisti, Giovani Italiane, Balilla, GUF and ONB)
as a consecration of Fascism's glorious destiny (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 21</a>);

<p>
6) Fascism's success at bringing the working masses within the fold
of the state through its afterwork organizations and labor unions (<A
NAME="2" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 22</a>).

<p>
Here the narrative is drawn in conventional fashion. Fascism begins as
a small outlaw movement; its transformation into a mass movement hinges
upon Mussolini, the founder of the Party and of the various prolongations
that discipline outlaw Fascism and build a bridge between the Italian
populace and the Party and Militia, bearing fruit in the form of a fully
Fascistized mass society. In the process it descends from Milan to Rome
and then, from Rome, marches outwards towards the expanding border

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 268]</b>

of a renewed empire. A second sequence, dating from March 1941,
is more daring. It alternates pages filtered through the colors
that make up the Italian flag with crowd scenes and banner
headlines. It begins with a tricolor typographical composition,
cast in the usual romanized Futura typeface and preceded by a
title in block red caps: "IL DUCE'S SPEECH." (<a name="3"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 23</a>) Then follow:

<p>
1) a full-page black and white image of Mussolini facing the green/black
continuation of the transcript of the speech (<a name="4"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#4"> 24</a>);

<p>
2) two opposing green/black text pages with a vertical seam of an
abstracted mass bearing the tag "Naples," running between them (<A
NAME="5" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#5"> 25</a>);

<p>
3) a full-page red filtered crowd, tagged "Turin," juxtaposed with a
continuation of the same text in alternating green and black typefaces
(<a name="6" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#6"> 26</a>);

<p>
4) a "split-screen" photomontage of mass rallies: civilian rallies in
the lower portion, tagged Milan, Catania, Genoa and Bari; a military
rally in the two-panel panorama that spans the upper portion, tagged Rome
(<a name="7" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 27</a>);

<p>
5) a black and white full page made up of seven images (one,
tagged Bologna, running the full length of the page; the others
half-page) of mass rallies in various cities, juxtaposed with the
conclusion of the text in the form of a red banner headline reading
"VICTORY, ITALY, PEACE WITH JUSTICE AMONG PEOPLES" (<a name="8"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 28</a>).

<p>
The image of the masses binds the entire sequence together vertically
or horizontally, fluttering through the pages along with the colors of
the Italian flag and the transcription of a speech given by Mussolini in
Naples calling upon the populace to rise up and triumph against Italy's
enemies. Here the mass panorama is at once everywhere and nowhere. It
res both as an irreducible whole out of which radiate other

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 272]</b>

images of mass mobilization and as an autonomous graphic element that
can be "cited" as the synecdoche of a totality encompassing the dictator
and the nation. An orderly totality because the dictator's commanding
presence is predicated upon the no less commanding presence of the man
with a camera, airbrush, scissors, glue, inks and fonts. The latter shapes
individual frames in which voids have been systematically edited out so as
to evoke a perpetually mobilized nation state, a nation state bursting at
the seams with energy. He then freely weaves these individual frames into
a graphic environment that is saturated with words, statistics, colors
and images of surging revolutionary tides yet geometrically austere. All
this to create the illusion that, under Fascism, sublimity has become
an integral feature of everyday life. But a constructive and controlled
fact of life, reconcilable with the values of hierarchy and discipline.

<p>
Whether freestanding or not, mass panoramas are as much about unleashing
revolutionary tides as they are about stilling and channeling them,
as much about infinite oceans as about the absolute finitude of the
frame, the grid, the geometry of the page, the edit and cut. Politically
disciplined by the leader, the crowd is pictorially disciplined through
photomontage.

<p>
The growing importance of strategies of contextualization bespeaks the
impact of film upon contemporary graphics and photography, which is
to say, of a growing sense that mass panoramicists were still laboring
under too great restraints to their sublime art. The overlap between the
photographic and the cinematic is considerable, but lies beyond the scope
of this essay. So I would like to conclude instead with some reflections
upon the broader impact of the mass panorama within modernist graphic
culture and, then, with an analysis of one post-WWII spillover. What
interests me here is the emergence of and the ubiquity of abstracted
images of the masses as visual quotations: quotations of the very
"oceanic" conventions whose history has been retraced in the Italian
context; quotations that translate the oceanic mass back into abstract
geometrical emblems of a distinctive sort. Photomontage is often viewed
as a formal method rooted in abstractionism, at odds with the aims of
documentarism or reportage. But, as Margarita Tupitsyn has emphasized
in her work on Gustav Klutsis, photomontage also provided artists with
a powerful new instrument of mass persuasion based upon the manipulation
of social realia, from statistics to slogans to photographs, which helps
to explain why its path of development intersects that of the Italian
mass panorama.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Both are arts of imagistic and informational crowding in the name
 of crowd shaping and crowd control; both share the same agitatory
 ambitions, the same impatience with conventional forms of realism;
 the same desire to forge&#8212;whether in the metallurgical or
 counterfeiting sense--anticipatory images of society as it ought to be
 (but is not yet).

<p>
The degree to which, for present purposes, the Italian case may be
considered normative is, of course, an open question. Ideological
frameworks make a difference, though sometimes more of shading than of
substance. I have hinted all along at some

<b></b>

of the distinctively "Fascist" characteristics of the <i>Rivista
Illustrata</i> foldouts. A case history of Soviet mass iconography,
for instance, would have found a comparable panoramic imagination
at work in such images as El Lissitzky's <i>The Current is Switched
On</i>  or Rodchenko and Stepanova's <i>USSR in Construction</i>
photo-tableaux , the former woven into a sequence visually coupling
electrification with collectivization, the latter juxtaposing rallying
workers with textile patterns. But this imagination, in keeping with the
values of Communist internationalism, emphasizes abstract representations
of the crowd and/or the crowd's relation to industrial machinery, while
de-emphasizing place names, architectural settings, and images featuring
regional or historical particulars. It also tends to place such images,
constructed according to the same elevated orthogonal perspective as
their Fascist counterparts, more emphatically in dialogue with the
sorts of heroic ground-up diagonal perspective shots of worker heroes
that abound in the films of Dovchenko and Eisenstein. (Though the
latter left a powerful mark as well in Fascist and liberal-democratic
political art.) Likewise, a case history of American mass photography
would have found overlaps with Italian and Soviet practice (self-evident
in explicitly political works like Arthur Siegel's 1941 photograph "The
Right of Assembly"), but overlaps within a setting where what prevails
instead are compositions like Weegee's Coney Island suite built around a
foreground in which individuals are visible in all their particularity
as members of family or sentimental units. As in the crowd foldouts
featured on the pages of <i>Life</i> magazine, collectivization in North
America is typically associated with leisure activities or individual
self-betterment, less with nation building than with participation in the
secular religion of work rewarded by affluence and fun. Rather than the
loss of individuality in the oceanic multitude, American photomontages
tend to emphasize self-multiplication.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Case studies of Nazi Germany, Getulio's Brazil, and Maoist China would
 have yielded additional convergences and divergences of a similar
 sort. Yet, for all these differences, what seems particularly striking
 are the continuities: technical/technological/graphic continuities
 and continuities also of a cultural-historical and perhaps even
 anthropological sort.

<p>
Certainly there can be no doubt that Italian industrial groups
knew exactly what it meant to "quote" the oceanic masses when they
placed ads in the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>. A first example, from
Magneti Marelli, dates from June 1935 and reworks the conventions
that this essay has been analyzing. (. <a name="9"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#9">29</a> and <a name="0"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#0">30</a>) Explictly so because
it pries apart a circular inset and mass panorama from an earlier
photomontage celebrating the founding of the Italian national
radio, inserting under the leader, in the guise of his podium,
a massive amplifier, and between the inset and panorama, a bank of
loudspeakers whose power of amplification is revealed as the force
that binds together leader and mass. In a second advertisement,
published in March 1938 for the Pirelli tire company, the masses
have taken over the circular inset, recast as a wheel riding atop the
prolongation of the capital P in the name Pirelli. (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 31</a>) Within the wheel and
resting upon them is the diagram of a factory hovering; looming behind
is a military star and a fasces composed of military, industrial,
and civilian vehicles&#8212;trucks, tractors, autos, airplanes, and
motorcycles&#8212;all shod with Pirelli tires. The composition

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 275]</b>

is geometrical but to designate it as such is not to say that it is
contentless, neutral, or purely ornamental, for the star, the fasces,
and the circle of workers re as emblems of a Fascist modernity
defined by national mobilization and accelerated movement. This
suggests that worker circles are ultimately no less emblematic than
are Arthur Mole's living clocks, it is simply that they function
within a context where traditional symbols have lost their value
unless, like the fasces, they have been infused with industrial
content. But what then of images such as Moholy-Nagy's 1930 photomontage
<i>Verantworte!</i> (or "Be Responsible!") in which the masses are
transformed into panoramic decorative stripes? (<a name="2"
href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 32</a>) A recent catalogue
description notes with respect to <i>Verantworte!</i> that "the crowd
scenes suggest demonstrations; the woman's mouth may represent the
importance of speaking out, although it appears oddly glamorous." The
montage is "a call to action, although the cause is not yet identified."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Far from standing for a desire to speak out, the "oddly glamorous"
 female visage is spliced into the oceanic mass so as to posit a
 fundamental equivalency. Both are volatile objects of modern masculine
 desires; both are to be approached with a mix of anticipation and
 anxiety, i.e. cautiously. Italian advertisements for 78 rpm recordings
 of Mussolini's speeches rehearse a similar graphic convention. The
 leader's word radiates outward from his body at once shaping the
 masses into concentric rings and piercing these very rings along
 a diagonal vector anchored in the doubly ringed title DUCE. Is the
 latter a microphone rising up from his podium or a second upraised
 fist? Or is it the switch by means of which the crowd's electrical
 current is turned on or the lever driving the engines that drive the
 ship of state? Little does it matter. The oceanic mass

<b></b>

seduces and thrills, and in so doing, poses a threat to individuality; but
its blandishments may be at once accepted and overcome through recourse
to geometrical discipline. Moholy's call to action may well be far more
cautionary than the call issued by the Italian state record company to
purchase copies of Mussolini's electrifying speeches, but, cautionary or
not, it remains illegible outside of the framework of the mass panorama.

<p>
The final word (or, rather, visual gesture) will have to go to Andy
Warhol, whose work from the early 1960s both traffics in mass panoramic
imagery and lays bare the latter's central graphic trope. Only a decade
away from what may perhaps rightly be viewed as the beginning of the end
of Le Bon's era of crowds, Warhol found in contemporary mass politics,
particularly as refracted through the rose-tinted lens of Communist
Chinese propaganda, the mirror image of the society of spectacle that he
was already celebrating in his serial images of Hollywood celebrities. So
to his serial portraits of Marilyn he added his own contribution to the
lineage of mass panoramas that the present essay has retraced. Entitled
<i>The Crowd</i>, these pictures tap into the same image bank of throwaway
press photos on which Warhol relied for the "Death in America" series. (<A
NAME="3" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 33</a>) Like
their car crash counterparts they refer to temporally dislocated events,
current events whose currency is at once obvious and in doubt: "obvious"
because, at first glance they might seem to refer to contemporary mass
protest movements&#8212;1963 was the year of Martin Luther King's March
on Washington; "in doubt" because, strictly speaking, they do not.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 (The ambiguity is telling inasmuch as Warhol's 1963&#8212;1964 "Race
 Riot" series, on the contrary, is based on "fresh" photojournalistic
 sources.)

<b></b>

<p>
<i>The Crowd</i> exists in two versions from 1963. Both appear to have
been elaborated in tandem with the <i>Thirteen Most Wanted Men</i>
panels for the New York State pavilion of the 1964 New York World's Fair
(censored by the pavilion overseers). Both derive from a single UPI source
photo, dated 4 November, 1955, on the back of which Warhol penciled in a
sketch of a woman's face. The photograph bore the legend: "Rome. Saint
Peter and the Crowd: The huge statue of Saint Peter seems to look down
benignly upon the crowd in Saint Peter's Square that gathered to hear
the Pope's blessing on Easter Sunday. It was impossible to estimate the
tremendous throng accurately, but

<b></b>

guesses range from 300,000 to 500,000."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 No trace of Peter or the Pope carries over into the Pop version of
 Mole's Christian Catholic multitudes (though a minute inspection reveals
 recurring clusters of priests and nuns). Rather, the works assume the
 form of large and grainy silk-screen prints of abstracted masses, built
 up, like the star and crash images, out of a single visual block that
 is repeated, shifted right or left, flipped on its head and cropped.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 The resulting scene might well have been oceanic were it not for
 the fact that here the tiles have come apart. The seams are showing
 and are crudely "covered up" by pencil marks. The repetitions are
 rudimentary. The squares have come unhinged (as has the implicit
 photojournalistic pact that links live events to their timely
 representation). The overall texture of the photographic image has
 become clotted as if printed on a sheet of tawdry newsprint. All of
 which makes any potential sense of vastness, power and sublimity seem
 more than a little dated, more than little trumped up.

<p>
<i>The Crowd</i> was crafted as a hundred thousand voices of patience,
pain, and anger echoed through the streets of Washington, with those
of anti-Vietnam war protesters soon to follow. Yet the Pope of Pop
anticipated the coming of an era in which Le Bon's volatile chemistry
would cease to work: an era in which, in national settings where
modernization has run its full course, a model of politics based upon
the physical massing of bodies in public places or the performance of
symbolic marches in real time and space would begin to be superceded by a
politics of gestures that relies upon virtual, indirect, and asynchronous
forms of presence, organization, and participation. The discontinuity
is, of course, a matter of emphasis. All modes of political action,
from negotiation to symbolic actions (including strikes and mass
demonstrations) to acts of collective violence are fated to remain
synchronous. Just as handwriting continued as a key instrument of
communication under the regime of typewriting and just as typewriting now
continues to play a role under the regime of digital writing and printing,
a fundamental simultaneity is to be expected. Where Warhol's intuition,
however, proves indicative is that, just as handwritten documents
look fundamentally <i>different</i> and function in a fundamentally
<i>different</i> way within a setting where machine writing is the
norm, so the once heroic image of the oceanic crowd now flickers live on
television screens under a growing patina of anachronism. (An anachronism
consciously embraced by mass choreographies like the Million Man March
that seek to repeat and, by means of repetition, to appropriate the image
of the civil rights marches of the 1960s.) With their power and prestige
mostly restricted to the domains of entertainment, sports and mediatized
religion, the multicolored and polyphonic tidal waves of revolution in
modern capitals now loom at a certain distance, as if brought back to
life from earlier phases in history, as if material from the now sealed
vault of modernity. The era of crowds is still very much with us. But,
in a deeper sense, perhaps it has passed.

Cicero's oceanophobia echoes that of Aristotle, who in <i>Politics</i>
7.6.5-6, had opined that it was good that cities "have ports and harbors
which are conveniently placed in relation to the main city&#8212;distinct
and separate, but not too remote . . ." due to threat that masses of
naval oarsmen would represent to the rule of law (<i>The Politics
of Aristotle</i>, ed. and trans. Ernest Barker [New York: Oxford
University Press, 1962], 294-95). In Cicero's case, the polemic is
not only anti-proletarian, but also anti-Carthaginian and anti-Greek
("Why need I mention the Greek islands? They are surrounded by the
sea and almost float&#8212;a description which applies no less to the
customs and institutions of the states that existed on them" [<i>On the

Dowie makes a cameo appearance in the Circe section of James Joyce's
<i>Ulysses</i>, where he inveighs against Bloom: "Fellowchristians and
antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace
to Christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this
stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery
recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This
vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the
Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath
of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for
him." James Joyce, <i>Ulysses</i> (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969), 463-64.

The city plan was, much like Mole's photographs, symbolic. It radiated
