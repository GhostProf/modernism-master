<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
Perhaps out of woman's contact with the advance movements of the
world there will in time arise a more honest and courageous womanhood,
devoid of petty shames, which shall be able and willing to contribute
to science intelligently the deepest complexities of woman's emotional
nature. . . . The book of the woman is yet to be written and it remains
for the woman to do it who is able and brave enough to strip herself
clean to the soul; to know herself and let herself be known.

<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
The realities of women's sexual life have been greatly obscured by the
lack of any sexual vocabulary. While her brother has often learned
all the slang of the street before adolescence, the conventionally
"decently brought-up" girl, of the upper and middle classes, has no terms
to define many of her sensations and experiences. When she marries, or
meets her first lover, she learns a whole new language, and often this
language has been defiled in the mind of the man who teaches it to her,
long before they met.

<p>
The early years of modernism's development in England and America witness
a lively public debate about sex in which women play a leading role. As
the epigraphs from sex reformers Margaret Sanger and Stella Browne
suggest, modern women concur, despite other disagreements, that their
time has come to "speak out" about sex, to re-present female sexuality.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The new science

<b></b>

of sexology is central in the debate: leading male sex reformers,
like Havelock Ellis, are sex scientists; leading female reformers,
like Sanger and Browne, adapt sexological arguments to their causes.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Yet as the quotations also indicate, these women understand well that
 language, as the scene and material of conceptual change, enables and
 constrains reform. They choose to speak women's sex, to (re)construct
 female sexuality for a new century through language, but the sexism
 inherent in available discourses of gender and sexuality necessarily
 conditions, limits, and problematizes their efforts. One goal of this
 essay is to understand better how writers like Sanger and Browne give
 voice to female sexuality using languages they perceive as fundamentally
 deformed by established sexual relations and social institutions.

<p>
At the moment this public debate on sex reaches a fevered pitch, World War
I significantly reconres sexual and power relations between women and
men (at least for a time), even as it reconres the various literary
movements and practices of the prewar avant-garde.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Two exemplary texts&#8212;<i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> (1915-17), a
 controversial work of avant-garde poetry by Mina Loy, and <i>Married
 Love</i> , a celebrated work of popular science by the birth
 control advocate Marie Stopes&#8212;illuminate how self-consciously
 modern female sex reformers respond to these wartime transformations
 while negotiating the complexities of speaking women's sex in the
 languages of the moment. My decision to consider as case studies a work
 of avant-garde lyric poetry and a work of popular science is intended to
 elucidate further the crucial role the discourses of lyric and science
 played in what Michel Foucault calls the "scheme for transforming sex
 into discourse," the "complex deployment for compelling sex to speak."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 At the start of the seventeenth century, Foucault argues, lyric

<b></b>

poetry becomes a leading genre for "the nearly infinite task of telling"
about sex (<i>HS,</i> 20). Later, in the nineteenth century, modern
medical science joins the process, principally, Foucault contends, through
a "biology of reproduction" and a "medicine of sex" (<i>HS,</i> 54). More
specifically, Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> and Stopes's <i>Married Love</i>
clarify how women's writing during the World War I, whether literary and
avant-garde or scientific and popular, articulates female sexuality by
mingling lexicons of science and literature, intellect and sentiment.

<p>
At first glance, however, these texts appear incompatible: <i>Love
Songs</i> is aggressively avant-garde poetry often interpreted to
express, as Carolyn Burke has pointed out, the radical aesthetic and
sexual doctrines of free verse and free love.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Written by a notorious "modern woman," the provocative <i>Love Songs</i>
 appears in Alfred Kreymborg's avant-garde little magazine <i>Others</i>,
 which was conceived of as a more radical alternative to Harriet
 Monroe's <i>Poetry</i>. Initially decried and derided as degenerate
 and pornographic, <i>Love Songs</i> is deemed "erotic and erratic"
 (<i>New York Sun,</i> 21 August 1915), "swill poetry," and even
 "Hoggerel" (<i>New York Tribune,</i> 3 July 1915).
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<i>Married Love,</i> in contrast, is a self-consciously popular marriage
manual written in a sentimental "poetical-soulful style" that expresses
aggressively normative conceptions of bourgeois respectability.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Authored by a respected paleobotanist, <i>Married Love</i> appears
 in wartime London to broad approval: in the first two weeks after
 publication, it sells two thousand copies; during the next nine years
 it is reprinted in England eighteen

<b></b>

times; within the next two decades readers buy over a million copies
(<i>SP,</i> 188; "FR," 137; <i>WI,</i> 366-7).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Recent scholars judge it "one of the first modern bestsellers,"
 a "literary landmark," and "the most-read book on sex of its
 time&#8212;perhaps of any time."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Despite these differences, <i>Love Songs</i> and <i>Married Love</i>
 actively participate in the spirited sex reform debates of the time.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 They "speak out" about the facts of sex, especially woman's; they
 link "contradictory strands" of the prewar sex reform debate; and as
 modernist texts they develop new idioms of female sexual experience
 by adapting established vocabularies, conjoining in different ways
 scientific and literary language.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Both texts should therefore be understood as important artifacts of
 modernism that participate in the effort to liberate sexual language
 from the allegedly repressive social and linguistic regimes of
 Victorianism.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
The texts of Stopes and Loy are also noteworthy as feminist political
documents because they move beyond the polarized arguments of British
feminism in the immediate prewar period. Legislative efforts to respond
to a perceived rise in child prostitution and the forced traffic in young
girls on the continent, the so-called white slave trade, provoked a heated
debate among feminists (<i>SP,</i> 86; <i>DS,</i> 126-7). Advocates for
"social purity," led by radical suffragettes like Christabel Pankhurst,
stressed women's "celibacy, evolutionary superiority and the power
of human love" (<i>DS,</i> 138). As Kathlyn Oliver, a self-proclaimed
"suffragist" and "feminist" argued in a 1912 propurity letter to the
<i>Freewoman</i>,

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in sex matters it is surely indisputable that we women are miles above
and beyond men. Some men would have us believe that their laxity in
this matter and their inability or lack of desire to restrain or control
their lower appetite is a sign of their superiority, but to me it only
proves that . . . they have still a long way to go before they are really
emancipated and evolved from the lower animal. But, alas! they hug the
chains which bind them.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But as social purity supporters imagined themselves to have evolved beyond
the constraints of animal instinct, libertarian advocates of a "'new
morality' of free sexual unions," such as Stella Browne, Dora Marsden,
and Rebecca West, countered that the "White Slave Act," would restrict
"individual liberty and encourage . . . prudish self-satisfaction"
(<i>DS,</i> 146). As Browne argued in a 1915 lecture to the reformist
Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, "These cold women generally have
a perfect mania for <i>prohibition</i> as a solution for all ills. But
surely, we do not want the new world to be built up only of women who have
long ago forgotten what sex means, or who have never experienced strong
sexual emotions, and regard them as a sign of grossness or decadence."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 If Browne refutes Oliver's implication that sexuality is only a
 "lower appetite" with a defense of female sexuality we might approve,
 she also exploits the antifeminist stereotype of the spinster, which
 was deployed effectively during the period to thwart feminist efforts
 of political reform.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 The quotations of Oliver and Browne also make clear how polarized
 British feminist discourse had become just before World

<b></b>

War I. Loy's and Stopes's texts, by bringing together arguments of social
purity and free love, resist certain oppositions of the debate. Both
writers reform these arguments by altering the languages in which they
were framed. Their efforts to move beyond the oppositions of purity and
free love by combining strands of both are enacted formally in attempts to
unite antagonistic, and differently gendered, vocabularies of sentimental
love and rationalist science. In pursuing this formal strategy, Loy's
<i>Love Songs</i> and Stopes's <i>Married Love</i> make the discourses
of literature and science work intimately together. Their efforts to
modernize gender by rewriting sex illuminate an important moment in
twentieth-century culture.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Sentimental Science, Scientific Love
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
As a work of popular science, <i>Married Love</i> relies more heavily on
the lexicons of sex science and formally enacts its ideological work more
straightforwardly than <i>Love Songs</i>. It sexes middle-class women,
marriage, and love by marrying a "feminine" literary language to a
"masculine" technical language. The text begins in a familiar idiom of
sentimental spiritualism, idealizing love as the union of "hearts" and
"souls" (<i>WI,</i> 367-8):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every heart desires a mate. For some reason beyond our comprehension,
nature has so created us that we are incomplete in ourselves; neither
man nor woman singly can know the joy of the performance of all the
human functions; neither man nor woman singly can create another human
being. This fact, which is expressed in our outward divergencies of form,
influences and colours the whole of our lives; and there is nothing for
which the innermost spirit of one and all so yearns as for a sense of
union with another soul, and the perfecting of oneself which such union
brings. [<i>ML,</i> 39]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Couched in metaphor and the vocabularies of lyric and religion, the
passage leaves almost unrecognizable the "human functions" and "outward
divergencies of form" it puts at the center of this soulful union. Stopes
makes sexual intercourse a metaphor for spiritual intercourse, yet so
emphasizes the tenor that it nearly occludes the vehicle. She maintains
this style for four chapters, keeping the facts of sex at arm's length,
justifying sexual relations by spiritualizing and aestheticizing them.

<p>
Having so contextualized these "human functions," Stopes prepares to
examine the "physiology of our most profoundly disturbing functions" by
adopting the rhetoric of the scientist as a shield against the dangers
of eroticism and pornography: "An impersonal and scientific knowledge
of the structure of our bodies is the surest safeguard against prurient
curiosity and lascivious gloating" (<i>ML,</i> 79, 80). This metaphoric
construction of scientific knowledge as aesthetic and moral prophylactic
is revealing because it anticipates formally Stopes's defense, in
<i>Married Love</i> and especially its sequel <i>Wise Parenthood</i>
, of birth control as a necessary method for achieving her ideal of
mated hearts. It also works ironically to emphasize the gendered power
inequities that thwarted feminist efforts to popularize birth control:
a rise in venereal infections among British soldiers had recently led
the government to distribute condoms and promote their use, arguably
legitimating contraception more significantly than

<b></b>

had years of feminist agitation (<i>SP,</i> 187-8).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 In this context, Stopes's modulation from a "feminine" language of
 metaphor and sentiment to a "masculine" language of facts and reason
 appears to be a strategic, even subversive, effort to authorize
 autonomous female sexuality by using a vocabulary of male authority:
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What actually happens in an act of union should be known. After the
preliminaries have mutually roused the pair, the stimulated penis,
enlarged and stiffened, is pressed into the woman's vagina. Ordinarily
when a woman is not stimulated, the walls of this canal, as well as
the exterior lips of soft tissue surrounding it, are dry and rather
crinkled, and the vaginal opening is smaller than the man's extended
penis. But when the woman is what is physiologically called tumescent
(that is, when she is ready for union and has been profoundly stirred)
these parts are flushed by the internal blood supply and to some extent
are turgid like those of the man, while a secretion of mucus lubricates
the channel of the vagina. . . . It can therefore be readily imagined
that when the man tries to enter a woman whom he has <i>not</i> wooed to
the point of stimulating her natural physical reactions of preparation,
he is endeavouring to force his entry through a dry-walled opening
too small for it. He may thus cause the woman actual pain, apart from
the mental revolt and loathing she is likely to feel for a man who so
regardlessly uses her. [<i>ML,</i> 80-1; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage begins in the mode of sex science, describing in a
terminology of impersonal observation the physical facts of intercourse,
what Stopes calls "the truths of sex."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 But by the passage's closing sentences, this "scientific" description
 of intercourse has become not merely a call for foreplay, but also a
 pointed condemnation of rape. While Stopes aims to provide readers
 with factual knowledge about sex acts, she also seeks to liberate
 female sexual pleasure and regulate male sexual domination. She makes
 male science work prophylactically to protect women from the "pain"
 and the "mental revolt and loathing" to which unregulated male desire
 has subjected them.

<p>
Stopes's unadorned scopic language works in other ways to promote and
control sexual intercourse. Penises, vaginas, blood, and mucus are
essential parts of love making, <i>Married Love</i> insists, but they
must be handled properly. Her discussion of orgasm clarifies further the
reformist and regulatory drives animating her "impersonal and scientific"
descriptions of sex (<i>ML,</i> 80):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When the two have met and united, the usual result is that, after a longer
or shorter interval, the man's mental and physical stimulation reaches a
climax in sensory intoxication and in the ejaculation of semen. When the
two are perfectly adjusted, the woman simultaneously reaches the crisis of
nervous and muscular reactions very similar to his. This mutual orgasm is
extremely important, but in many cases the man's climax comes so swiftly
that the woman's reactions are not nearly ready, and she is left without
it. . . . [I]t is hardly an exaggeration to say that 70 or 80 per cent
of our married women (in the middle classes) are deprived of the full
orgasm through the excessive speed of the husband's reactions. . . . So
deep-seated, so profound, are woman's complex sex-instincts as well as
her organs, that in rousing them the man is rousing her whole body and
soul. And this takes time. [<i>ML,</i> 83]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The stress on mutual orgasm as the legitimating principle of coitus
reveals Stopes's interest in recasting a free love paradigm of mutually
pleasurable sex in terms more

<b></b>

palatable to a substantial, middle-class audience (<i>SP,</i> 191). At the
same time, her satiric rebuke of English men for what she elsewhere calls
their "prevalent failure . . . to effect orgasms for their wives at each
congress" plays on cultural ideals of masculine power (<i>ML,</i> 88). At
a time when masculinity is literally under siege in the trenches, she
exploits male insecurity to validate female desire. Stopes's paradoxical
reliance on ideals of masculinity to write female sexuality into popular
language helps clarify the structural sexism of British public discourse
and reveals her complex manipulations of that discourse to open a space
for female sexuality.

<p>
Yet despite Stopes's use of a rhetoric of scientific objectivity, her
text often maintains a peculiar reticence about crucial aspects of the
sexual relations it seeks to illuminate, especially the "preliminaries"
she repeatedly identifies as essential for realizing the ideal sexual
and spiritual union. While <i>Married Love</i> advises emphatically
that a man "<i>must woo</i>" his wife "<i>before every separate act of
coitus,</i>" Stopes rarely discusses the specific techniques required to
"profoundly stir" "woman's complex sex-instincts" (<i>ML,</i> 81; italics
in original). Stopes's refusal to be explicit about the facts of foreplay,
despite her stress on orgasm as the climax of "perfectly adjusted" sex,
arguably aggravates the problems of women's sexual deprivation, coercion,
and dissatisfaction that the text claims to redress. Moreover, as Geppert
has emphasized, her ideal union overlooks forms of sexual activity
that are not heterosexual or genitally or orgasmically centered ("MBS,"
431). And her parenthetical proviso that the widespread deprivation of
orgasm occurs "in middle class women" confirms the class boundaries and
prejudices of <i>Married Love.</i>
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It is not surprising, then, that Stopes has been read as, in effect,
 reproducing British patriarchy by rehabilitating Victorian codes of
 respectability and buttressing sexist, classist, and heteronormative
 ideals and institutions.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
That <i>Married Love</i> does not transcend the conceptual limitations of
its moment is of less significance, I think, than its effort to fashion
a language of female sexuality out of the gendered discourses at hand
(cf. "FR," 146; "MBS," 480). We have seen how Stopes creates a new
conception and idiom of women's sex by wedding previously incompatible
ideas and lexicons. <i>Married Love</i> makes free love's assertion of
autonomous female sexuality and advocacy of birth control compatible
with social purity's normalizing moralism and defense of bourgeois
heterosexual marriage by joining a "female" language of sentimental
spiritualism to a "male" language of scientific rationality, marrying
metaphoric descriptions of hearts and souls to graphic descriptions of
vaginas and penises. We can gauge the fruitfulness of these efforts
by looking at the text's popularity with bourgeois and working class
readers, its effectiveness in giving voice to an autonomous middle-class
female sexuality, and its success in legitimating and popularizing birth
control in Britain (<i>SP,</i> 188; "FR," 140). Of greater importance
for our argument are the ways Stopes represents this ideological and
formal union as both biologically <i>and</i> aesthetically fruitful:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the complete act of union is a triple consummation. It symbolizes, and at
the same time actually enhances, the spiritual union; there are a myriad
subtleties of soul-structures which are compounded in this alchemy. At
the same time the act gives the most intense physical pleasure and
benefit which the body can experience, and it is a <i>mutual</i>, not a

<b></b>

selfish, pleasure and profit, more calculated than anything else to draw
out an unspeakable tenderness and understanding in both partakers of this
sacrament; while, thirdly, it is the act which gives rise to a new life
by rendering possible the fusion of one of the innumerable male sperms
with the female egg-cell. [<i>ML,</i> 84]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike pornographic representations of coitus, popularly held to
breed nonproductive autoeroticism and eventual degeneracy, Stopes's
representations of the "supreme human art, the art of love" are richly
productive (<i>ML,</i> 31). <i>Married Love</i> makes sexual intercourse
fruitful by making it pleasurable, spiritual, and reproductive. Properly
practiced, coitus generates not only children (though they are crucial),
but also love between the married couple and the individual spouse's
self-love. The passage enacts this productivity formally through its
integration of previously contradictory lexicons: in this "fusion,"
spiritual unions, soul-structures, and sacraments "are compounded"
with intense physical pleasure, male sperms, and female egg-cells.

<p>
From certain points of view, the achievement of <i>Married Love</i>
can appear limited. Its sentimentality and popular success can be
seen as aesthetic failings, just as its neglect of nonreproductive,
heterosexual, and working-class sexualities can be seen as political
failings. Yet <i>Married Love</i> can also be understood to articulate
and defend a kind of modernism. For Stopes's text shares with those of
writers such as D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Loy not
only the conviction that changes in language can affect changes in sexual
relations, but also, though to a lesser extent, the formal juxtaposition
of different lexicons and linguistic registers. By wedding the politics of
free love and social purity and the languages of sentiment and science,
<i>Married Love</i> pursues, less pyrotechnically and more popularly
to be sure, the modernist ambition of reforming language and life,
especially sexual language and life. It should therefore be understood
as a key text in the still-neglected tradition of twentieth-century
literature that Suzanne Clark has termed sentimental modernism.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

Dissecting Love
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
If <i>Married Love</i> clarifies the success of modern women writers'
wartime efforts to transform sexual relations by transforming language,
<i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> clarifies the limitations of those efforts.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Before turning to Loy's revisions of prewar feminism and sex science
 in <i>Love Songs,</i> we need to consider two earlier texts: the
 poem "Parturition," first published in the October 1914 issue of
 <i>The Trend,</i> and the contemporaneous, unpublished "Feminist
 Manifesto." Both of these texts articulate the political and aesthetic
 positions that <i>Love Songs</i> interrogates poetically.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Rejecting the argument that female chastity is proof of woman's
 essential morality and the basis for redress through law and education
 (captured, most famously, in Pankhurst's motto, "Chastity for Men,
 Votes for Women"), Loy's "Feminist Manifesto" insists that "there
 is <i>nothing impure in sex</i>" and that "economic legislation,
 vice crusades &amp; uniform education" only "gloss . . . over
 <i>Reality</i>."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Yet Loy's "Manifesto" does not sanction a defense of sex, in Dora
 Marsden's words, "for its own satisfaction" in place of the purity
 reform

<b></b>

movement's view "that sex is primarily experienced with the motive of
continuing the race."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Instead, just as <i>Married Love</i> brings together free love's
 autonomous female sexuality and purity's reproductive bourgeois
 marriage, Loy's "Feminist Manifesto" joins free love's pleasurable sex
 outside marriage with purity's reproductive sex understood in terms
 of racial evolution. As DuPlessis writes, in Loy's work "Maternalist
 thinking meets free love."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Loy's attempt to unite the language of free love and the language of
 racial purity is evident in her manifesto:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every woman has a right to maternity&#8212;
<br />
Every woman of superior intelligence should realize her
race-responsibility, in producing children in adequate proportion to
the unfit or degenerate members of her sex&#8212;
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a
definite period of psychic development in her life&#8212;&amp;
not necessarily of a possibly irksome &amp; outworn continuance of
an alliance&#8212;spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the
beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the parties to
it&#8212;follow their individual lines of personal evolution&#8212;
[<i>LB,</i> 155]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While Loy relies on arguments crucial to racist and patriarchal
defenses of empire (as would Stopes in a number of her later birth
control manuals), she unconventionally uses them to promote a "race"
of free-loving, independent, and avant-garde mothers and children.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 As rearticulated in Loy's "Feminist Manifesto," the eugenicists' master
 race becomes almost the product of independent female creativity,
 a possibility "Parturition" elaborates and intensifies.

<p>
Loy was not alone among supporters of free love in embracing reproduction
and maternity.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 While most new moralists advocated birth control as a means to advance
 woman's pleasure and self-realization (what Weeks terms the "separation
 of sex from procreation" and Richard Brown calls "copulation without
 population"), some argued that free unions based on true love would
 also advance racial evolution.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Free love eugenicists, who promoted sexual liberation and "voluntary
 motherhood," placed their hopes for racial advance in the so-called
 "Love Child."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 Interweaving languages of free love and eugenics similar to those found
 in Loy's "Manifesto," a 1912 correspondent to the <i>Freewoman</i>
 celebrates the Love Child as:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the <i>beautiful child</i>, i.e., the child born from intense
mutual passion. Such children are always the best physically and
mentally. . . . The child of intense passionate mutual love is as much
in advance of the average child as the European child is in advance of
the negro.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the logics of scientific racism turn from the task of justifying
British imperial conquest to legitimate free love's ideal of "intense
mutual passion" by declaring the "racial" superiority of the Love Child.

<p>
Reading Loy's "Parturition" in this context clarifies how the poem links
the eugenicist celebration of biological creativity to the modernist
celebration of aesthetic creativity. Scholars have studied Loy's
manipulations of line lengths and white space to

<b></b>

demonstrate linguistically the experiences of labor and contractions
(<i>AM,</i> 45; "NP," 53). "Parturition" also portrays biological
reproduction as a species of aesthetic production; woman poet births
herself as mother superior even as she births a new maternalist free
verse:


<blockquote>

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Loy evokes social purity's spiritualized motherhood, but revises the
religious idealization by displacing the re of God the Father,
who creates the universe through language. In this provocative
rewriting of patriarchal religion, the male creator ("I am that I
am") exists only as a distant echo, the human mother transred
into the "was&#8212;is&#8212;ever&#8212;shall&#8212;be / Of cosmic
reproductivity." "Mother I am," the reborn maternal poet proclaims,
transcending, as the compounding of mutually exclusive temporal
terminology ("was&#8212;is&#8212;ever&#8212;shall&#8212;be) implies,
the limits of masculine reason and creativity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The resignifying overthrow of patriarchy's "I am" is formally
 enacted in the overthrow of patriarchal prosody (the hegemony of
 iambs), a victory emphasized by Loy's flashy modulation from free
 verse to rhymed couplet at the moment the speaker is "absorbed"
 into "cosmic reproductivity." Loy's cosmic Mother also rewrites
 eugenics by displacing male science's strategic manipulations of
 natural reproductive processes with the independent supermother whose
 creativity overwhelms male power, science, and poetics.

<p>
"Parturition" realizes poetically the ideal of free loving maternalism
described in Loy's manifesto. The poem affirms the success of this
conjunction of feminist theory and poetic practice by portraying it as
multiply fruitful. As in Stopes's representation of "the art of love,"
the merging of otherwise autonomous categories of language and thought
produces a number of advantages. As Kouidis and Burke point out, the poem

<b></b>

births at once a self-creating, independent Mother; a superior, evolved
Love Child; and a modern feminist verse (<i>AM,</i> 40, "NP," 53). In this
context, the exhortation to "demolish . . . the division of women into
two classes <i>the mistress</i>, &amp; <i>the mother</i>" that appears
in the "Feminist Manifesto" can also be understood as an exhortation to
demolish the division that separates female creativity into the biological
and the aesthetic, and the division that separates language into the
masculine-literal-scientific and the feminine-metaphoric-spiritual
(<i>LB,</i> 154). In this light, Stopes's popular science book appears to
answer the call of Loy's avant-garde polemic; its detailed descriptions
of "physiological facts" in "simple, direct and scientific language"
act to produce a "fusion of joy and rapture . . . not purely physical"
that "sweeps into its flaming tides the whole essence of the man and
woman . . . vaporis[ing] their consciousness so that it fills the whole
of cosmic space" (<i>ML,</i> 80, 75, 106).

<p>
Loy's conception of a female creativity that transcends cultural and
biological oppositions not only promotes women as sexual beings, cultural
producers, and philosophical theorists, but also challenges defensive
assertions by leading male modernists&#8212;especially, F. T. Marinetti
and Ezra Pound&#8212;of male creativity's parthenogenic powers and of
women's essential parasitic passivity.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Accordingly, "Parturition" demotes the creative potency of the male
 artist:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The open window is full of a voice
<br />
A fashionable portrait painter
<br />
Running upstairs to a woman's apartment
<br />
Sings
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"All the girls are tid'ly did'ly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All the girls are nice
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
Leaves woman her superior inferiority.
<br />
He is running upstairs
<p>
I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony [<i>LB,</i> 5]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>
<br />


<p>
Loy's jagged free verse satirizes cultural ideals of male power, courage,
and responsibility. This "man"&#8212;likely based on Loy's unfaithful
husband Stephen Haweis-displays conventional traits of femininity:
fashionable, he voices the childish languages of sentimental love,
"running" away from the speaker's agonizing creative labor. The quotation
exposes woman's alleged inferiority as a cultural fa&ccedil;ade that
conceals her true superiority. As rendered in the "Feminist Manifesto"
and "Parturition," free unions finally serve to evolve the individualist
woman beyond dependence on man.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 In contrast to Stopes's language of productive sexuality, which depends
 on love's sentimental languages, "Parturition" forges a language of
 productive female sexuality freed from sentimental attachments to men.

<b></b>

<p>
Despite these resonances with the "Feminist Manifesto"'s radical
maternalism, however, "Parturition" reveals doubts about the theory,
exposing its conceptual problematics. That woman's "superior inferiority"
can also be read, as Lyon shows, to emphasize a sense of woman's
inferiority, isolation, and dependence, raises questions about the poem's
commitment to maternalism ("PP," 388). That the "LIFE" the speaker births
barely engages her attention ("Touch of infinitesimal motion / Scarcely
perceptible"), raises questions as to whether this "Love Child" is "in
advance of the average child," and thus whether the ideal of reproductive
free love based on "intense passionate mutual love" has been realized.

<p>
Indeed, the conjunction of biological and cultural creativity multiplies
the possibilities that the ideal of reproductive free love will
fail. By subscribing to the teleological conception of sex associated
with eugenics and by embracing the Love Child as the proof of free love,
"Feminist Manifesto" and "Parturition" make aesthetic production dependent
on biological reproduction. Loy's <i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> gives
voice to this problem by enacting the failure of free love maternalism,
thus thwarting the "maternalist hopes" that animate the earlier works
("SO," 62-3).
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<i>Love Songs</i> represents this failure as biological because Loy's
free lovers cannot bring their relationship to eugenic fruition in the
production of a Love Child:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We might have coupled
<br />
In the bedridden monopoly of a moment
<br />
Or broken flesh with one another
<br />
At the profane communion table
<br />
Where wine is spilled on promiscuous lips
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We might have given birth to a butterfly
<br />
With the daily news
<br />
Printed in blood on its wings [<i>LB,</i> 54]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While the first stanza flamboyantly yokes the lexicons of religion and
sex as in "Parturition," the conjunction does not enact formally the
productive union of free lovers. Loy emphasizes the incommensurability of
these lexicons to stress the lovers' failure to validate their union by
birthing the Love Child. Hence the second stanza's image of the unrealized
product of this "coupling" remains difficult to pin down. Is this bloody
butterfly a supernatural embodiment of the avant-garde dream of bridging
the great divides between art and praxis? Is it a modernist icon that
transres the quotidian into transcendent art? Or is it an imagistic
freak of nature that naturalizes the failure of free love by implying
that the Love Child is as fantastic and unrealizable as the productive
sexual conjunction of the human species and the insect?
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
This poetic interrogation of reproductive free love not only limits
the female creativity celebrated in the "Feminist Manifesto" and
"Parturition." It also evokes the pathologizing, categorizing impulses
of most European sexology. Exemplary of this tendency is Richard von
Krafft-Ebing's <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> , which sought to
classify the entire range of sexual pathologies, labeling "degenerate"
any sexual practice

<b></b>

that deviated from the alleged normality of reproductive heterosexual
intercourse.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 From such a normalizing sexological perspective, the love affair
 portrayed in <i>Love Songs</i> appears degenerate because it is not
 biologically fruitful:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The contents
<br />
Of our ephemeral conjunction
<br />
In aloofness from Much
<br />
Flowed to approachment of&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
<br />
NOTHING
<br />
There was a man and a woman
<br />
In the way [<i>LB,</i> 63-4]
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Man and woman function prophylactically to prohibit the biological
reproduction crucial to eugenic free love ("SO," 62). The lovers'
"ephemeral conjunction" yields "NOTHING." In this light, <i>Love Songs</i>
is a post-free love poem as DuPlessis suggests; the conjunction of
science's clinical language and love's sentimental language portrays
the obstruction of free love and the Love Child.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 Unlike Stopes's <i>Married Love,</i> Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> finds
 no lasting marriage between freewoman and man, sentiment and science,
 biology and culture.

<p>
Accordingly, the ideal of the reproductive free union of evolved true
lovers generates no corresponding formal union. In <i>Love Songs,</i>
vocabularies of science and rationality cohabit antagonistically with
vocabularies of love and sentiment, opposing and undermining each
other, enacting formally the unrealizability of union between lovers
and languages. <i>Love Songs</i> resists, as Shreiber argues, the
lyric tradition of aesthetic compensation for this failure; its uses
of fragmentation, collage, jarring juxtaposition, and satire irritate
readers, as Twittchel-Waas suggests, frustrating the sentimental
identification necessary for such compensations.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The "truths of sex" <i>Love Songs</i> exposes are discordant,
 contradictory, and ugly:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The skin-sack
<br />
In which a wanton duality
<br />
Packed
<br />
All the completion of my infructuous impulses
<br />
Something the shape of a man
<br />
To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant
<br />
More of a clock-work mechanism
<br />
Running down against time
<br />
To which I am not paced [<i>LB,</i> 53-4]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Loy's graphic descriptions of sex organs undermine the idealizing
celebration of spiritual union. As depicted here, scrotum and testicles
emphasize the biological <i>in</i>compatibility of women and men. While
<i>Married Love</i> affirms that the "race desire" of men, "always
present, ever ready to wake," can be "adapt[ed]," "adjust[ed],"
and "repress[ed]" into "harmony" with the "intermittent" "nature" of
women's desire, this stanza makes such harmonizing regulation impossible
(<i>ML,</i> 72-3). Loy renders the

<b></b>

speaker's realization of this incompatibility a source of pathos; yet
it also provokes her bitterness and the satiric metaphor of her beloved
as genitals.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 "Parturition"'s independent mother is displaced by a dependent
 female lover, whose creative agency is circumscribed by the beloved's
 unwillingness to accommodate her desires and to share his sperm to
 "complete" their union in the Love Child; her creative and sexual
 "impulses" remain unfulfilled, "infructuous." <i>Love Songs</i> aborts
 "Parturition"'s conjunction of free love and free verse; it turns free
 verse from a medium that realizes free love into one that interrogates
 and dissects it.

<p>
Yet as the lurking pathos of these lines suggests, Loy's speaker
does not wholeheartedly embrace (masculine) modernism's programmatic
antisentimentalism, its ironic detachment from love.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Accordingly, the next stanza reasserts the attachment to the
 unattainable beloved that is central to lyric sentimentality:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My fingertips are numb from fretting your hair
<br />
A God's doormat
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the threshold of your mind [<i>LB,</i> 54]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Attending this recurrence of unrequited love for the beloved is the
reappearance of the male God banished in "Parturition." Loy's speaker
remains fretful that physical contact does not ensure emotional and
spiritual union, despite the damning self-description implied by
the metaphor of her beloved's hair as "God's doormat." Indeed, the
aesthetic power of the stanza and of <i>Love Songs</i> overall depends
on Loy's refusal to resolve the poem's ambivalence between a modernist
resistance to the sentimental and an attachment to love and the topoi
of lyric. Like the re of the unrealized or aborted Love Child, the
languages of sentimentality periodically interrupt the poem's overriding
posture of ironic and analytical detachment, reasserting the discredited
sentiment of love ("SO," 64, "LTM," 32). Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> remains
suspended between free love and social purity, literature and science,
sentimentalism and modernism.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 It is this suspension that I want, finally, to emphasize.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 For her poetic appropriations of sex science modernistically rewrite the
 languages of female sexuality even as they illuminate the limitations
 of modernism's reformist aesthetic and sexual ambitions.

<p>
But my point is neither to lament those limits, nor to criticize
Stopes, Loy, or their contemporaries for the "failings" of their
writing and politics. Both Stopes's scientific defense of sentimental
love and Loy's ironic dissection of reproductive free love confirm that
writing new models of sexuality will not fully realize those models in
praxis. Thus, while <i>Married Love</i> and <i>Love Songs</i> may not
fulfill Sanger's ideal of a "more courageous womanhood, devoid of petty
shames," they do succeed in questioning the "great divide" between science
and literature, intellect and sentiment, and in forging new relations
between these allegedly incompatible disciplines and discourses. As
we've seen, both Stopes and Loy understood well that idioms of scientific
rationality served to legitimate modern science as a realm of masculine
objectivity. By applying those idioms to reformist ends, <i>Married
Love</i> and <i>Love Songs</i> challenge the sexist mythology

<b></b>

of female irrationality and affirm women's fitness to write in and revise
the lexicons of science and intellect. At a time when male writers defined
literary modernism as a realm of antisentimental, masculine impersonality,
Stopes's and Loy's books modernize sentimentalism by conjoining idioms
of scientific rationality and impersonal detachment with vocabularies of
lyric sentiment, thus affirming the continuing relevance of sentimentality
to modernism's efforts to reform gender by rewriting sex.

While <i>Married Love</i> is not explicit on the subject, Stopes's
assertion that "70 or 80 per cent of our married women (in the
middle classes) are deprived of . . . full orgasm," suggests that she
accepted the common bourgeoisie view of the working class as, in Weeks
words, "condemned . . . to sexual rampancy and immorality" (<i>SP,</i>
32-3). Weeks also articulates the paradoxical nature of Stopes's relations
to working-class women: while "she evoked an immediate response amongst
working-class women," she "displayed nevertheless a deep ignorance of
working-class life" (<i>SP,</i> 191). Cf. Richard A. Soloway, "Marie
Stopes, Eugenics and the Birth Control Movement," in <i>Marie Stopes,
Eugenics, and the English Birth Control Movement,</i> ed. Robert
A. Peel (London: Galton Institute, 1997), 49-76. Soloway argues that
"While her writings about the poor were often harsh, condescending, and
censorious, and at times she seemed to have difficulty thinking of them
as being motivated by much more than dangerous and ignorant impulses for
immediate gratification, Stopes could be deeply moved and horrified by
the individual plight of some of the impoverished mothers who wrote her
and came to the clinic" .

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The status of sexology as science, and Stopes' socialization as a
scientist, resulted in her initial commitment to female sexual autonomy
being undermined by an essentially phallocentric model of sexuality,
in which sex was reduced to a coital imperative. Far from empowering
women . . . it reinforced male power in heterosexual relationships by
eroticizing male dominance and female submission and underpinning them by
so called 'laws of love.'. . . Stopes' model of sexuality also undermined
relationships between women, by defining them as unnatural and perverted,
and helped to fuel the anti-spinster backlash. [155, cf. 132]

Despite, or perhaps because of, years of neglect, Loy's work has,
since around 1980, prompted a (growing) number of scholars to produce a
particularly distinguished and illuminating body of scholarship. Janet
Lyon wryly terms it a "Loy boom"; Lyon, "Mina Loy's Pregnant Pauses:

of social purity and free love draws on and is meant to complement
DuPlessis's groundbreaking account. Lyon also notes that Loy's manifesto
"casts women squarely within reproductive ideology" ("PP," 386).

As Weeks points out, Stopes too "fully shared the eugenic world view,"
although <i>Married Love</i> is less explicitly eugenic than her later
works (<i>SP,</i> 190; see also <i>ML,</i> 106-18). In <i>Radiant
Motherhood: A Book for Those Who Are Creating the Future</i> (London:
Putnam, 1920), for instance, Stopes laments that



<blockquote>

society allows . . . the very lowest and worst members of the community,
to produce innumerable tens of thousands of stunted warped and inferior
infants. If they live, a large proportion of them are doomed from
their very physical inheritance . . . to drain the resources of those
classes above them which have a sense of responsibility. [221; quoted
in <i>SP</i>, 190]

For other accounts of the various failures Loy portrays and probes
in <i>Love Songs,</i> see <i>AM,</i> 59-85; "NP," 51-2; Selinger,
"Love in the Time of Melancholia"; Shreiber, "Love Is a Lyric"; and
"SO," 50-66. Twitchell-Waas warns, contrarily, that "we should resist
reading" the poem's "formal radicalism as 'fragmentary,' as reflecting
disintegration," lest we replicate "the old Lukacsian argument that
modernist forms passively reflect the sense of disintegration," and reduce
"such experiments to a psychological realism which expresses a loss of
nerve and moral responsibility in the face of inexorable reification"
("LL," 115).

For a reading of the child-butterfly image that emphasizes its resonances
with the poem's wartime context, see "LL," 119-20. Also see Quartermain,

poetry, its Dickinsonian "flickering between hope and skepticism," see

DuPlessis argues that "Loy exists in an angry mourning for the lack of or
loss of a child from sex, a rejoining, for both radical and eugenicist
reasons, of sexual intercourse and reproduction, which can be the most
traditional justification for the sexual embrace" ("SO," 64); cf. "LL,"
115. Both Shreiber and Selinger contend that <i>Love Songs</i> recounts
an abortion, citing especially Song seventeen (<i>LB,</i> 59-60).

Shreiber, "Love Is a Lyric," 93, 103; "LL," 112; DuPlessis argues that in
<i>Love Songs</i> "Loy refuses the novelistic linkage of sexual climaxes
and narrative climaxes" epitomized by D. H. Lawrence's novels ("SO," 66).

That Loy does not use the more familiar metaphor of man as penis&#8212;a
favorite of Pound, for instance&#8212;suggests her possible familiarity
with sexological accounts of the glandular basis of sexual desire
(<i>SP,</i> 147). Interestingly, Loy was asked about her friendship
with Pound for a 1943 <i>Picture Magazine</i> article, she replied that
Pound was fascinated by the topic of "endocrine glands": "He would talk
about it a great deal&#8212;very learned discussion. Glands . . . were
the latest thing at the time." See Marisa Januzzi, "Mongrel Rose: The
'Unerring Esperanto' of Loy's Poetry," in <i>Mina Loy: Woman and Poet,</i>

Twitchell-Waas notes that "the torsion of the <i>Songs</i> twists between. . . extremes of utopian enlargement and ironical cynicism" ("LL," 116).

<p>
<a name="FOOT46" href="#REF46">46</a>.
Twitchell-Waas contends that Loy's reader is often "left suspended,"
and that her poem's "unnerving undecidability is itself an effort to
suspend the gender distinctions the poems bring to critical consciousness"
("LL," 112, 113).
