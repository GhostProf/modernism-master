<p>
No genealogist of the complex and heterogeneous cultural field we have
come to call aesthetic modernism can fail to acknowledge its multiple
intersections with that other richly articulated field known as modern
psychology. In both cases, an unprecedented preoccupation with the
interior landscape of the subject, a no longer self-confident self
functioning with increased difficulty in the larger world outside its
threatened and vulnerable boundaries, led to voyages of scientific and
artistic discovery whose endpoints have yet been reached. Whether it
be the empiricist tradition of Ernst Mach, Franz Brentano and William
James recently foregrounded by Judith Ryan in <I>The Vanishing
Subject</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Jean-Martin Charcot's investigations of
hysteria inspirational for such modernist movements as Surrealism, or
Freudian psychoanalysis, whose importance for modernism is evident in
such accounts as Carl Schorske's <I>Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle
Vienna</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 the story of aesthetic innovation has seemed
impossible to narrate without reference to the no less radical
developments in psychology happening at virtually the same time. What
Ryan calls the "complex intertextuality"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 between modernism
and psychology has perhaps reached its zenith in Louis Sass's recent
<I>Madness and Modernism</I>, which boldly seeks to understand such
familiar aspects of the modernist temper as perspectivism,
dehumanization, alienation, ironic detachment, hyperreflexivity, and
spatialized form precisely by finding affinities with the workings of
the schizophrenic mind, which was itself first labeled in the 1890s
and quickly became, he tells us, "the quintessential form of madness
in our time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 

<p>
Cultural fields, however, not only intersect and parallel each other,
producing reinforcements, homologies, and elective affinities, but
also sometimes interact through repulsions and negations, achieving
their fragile definitions by means of abjecting the other. In the case
of modernism and psychology, I want to argue, such a process of
negative exclusion did, in fact, occur, a process which overlapped and
sometimes interfered with the more positive interaction that has been
explored by other scholars. In particular, I want to show that what
the philosophers of this period called "psychologism" and which many
sought mightily to banish from their search for truth also emerged as
a source of anxiety at certain key moments in the genesis of aesthetic
modernism as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 My evidence will come from both
literary and visual instances of this anxiety.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Although I
do not want to be understood as saying modernism was essentially a
repudiation of psychologism, let alone unrelated to developments in
the psychological sciences per se, no understanding of its emergence
can afford to ignore the haunting presence of this stigmatized "-ism"
as a specter that refused to be effortlessly exorcised.

<p>
The philosophical critique of psychologism can be traced at least as
far back as Kant's claim that: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
in logic we do not want to know how understanding is and thinks and
how it hitherto has proceeded in thinking, but how it ought to proceed
in thinking. Logic must teach us the correct use of the understanding,
i.e. that in which it is in agreement with itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
His transcendental deduction was thus explicitly distinguished between
the <I>questio facti</I> of the "physiological derivation" of a priori
ideas and the <I>questio juris</I> of their validity. The most
elaborate and influential development of the critique, however,
appeared after a period in which psychologism gained ground among
philosophers and the upstart discipline of experimental psychology had
emerged to challenge philosophy as the royal road to unlocking the
mysteries of the mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Although there were rumblings
throughout the nineteenth century, only at its end did psychologism
emerge as a primary target of a philosophical counterattack. In 1884,
Gottlob Frege published <I>The Foundations of Arithmetic</I>, which
vigorously criticized attempts by philosophers such as Friedrich
Beneke, Jakob Fries, John Stuart Mill, and Franz Brentano to reduce
the mind, in particular its logical function, to the
psyche.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 More radical psychologizers like Nietzsche were
beneath Frege's consideration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<p>
Husserl, although himself initially indebted to Brentano, was
putatively won over to Frege's position by a devastating review the
latter wrote of Husserl's early work <I>The Foundations of
Arithmetic</I> in 1894.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 By his <I>Logical
Investigations</I> of 1900, Husserl had come to see that the empirical
science of psychology with its inductive laws of association could not
provide a basis for a pure, deductive logic, which goes beyond mere
probabilistic knowledge. In the 1890s, other philosophers, such as the
neo-positivist Alexius Meinong and the neo-Kantians Rudolf Hermann
Lotze and Hermann Cohen, also vigorously turned against psychologism,
moving away from epistemological questions to logical and ontological
ones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In physics as well, a challenge <b></b> to the radical
associationism of Ernst Mach and the "energeticism" of Wilhelm Ostwald
was launched by defenders of the reality of discrete atoms like Ludwig
Boltzmann.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 At the same time, sociologists like Emile
Durkheim and Max Weber sought to avoid reducing social facts to their
alleged psychological substratum, and historians like Wilhelm Dilthey
gave up their search for underlying psychological types in favor of
hermeneutics of objective meaning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>


<p>
This is not the place to attempt a full-scale history of
anti-psychologism, a task admirably carried out by Martin Kusch in a
recent study in the sociology of knowledge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Suffice it to
say that shortly after Husserl's conversion, it became a fundamental
principle of many influential twentieth-century philosophers in
different camps, including such otherwise disparate res as
Heidegger, Cassirer, Russell, Moore, Carnap, Luk&aacute;cs, and
Goldmann.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Even the early Wittgenstein, as Cora Diamond
has recently shown, sought to banish psychology and follow the Kantian
dictum that logic was in agreement only with itself, however much he
may have ultimately come to question Frege's belief that logic might
be freed of ordinary language as well and expressed in a pure,
unequivocal "concept-script."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>


<p>
There were, of course, many variations in the alternatives to
psychologism provided by these critics, and indeed their target was
not always understood in precisely the same way, but the general
complaint was as follows.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Reducing the mind to the psyche
was problematic for logic and mathematics because it opened the door
to relativism in which truth was merely a function of the specific
thinking mind in which it appeared or of its cumulative experience
over time. Even the concepts of a species-wide transcendental
consciousness or innate biological capacities (of the kind later
defended by Noam Chomsky) were insufficient to ward off the threat of
psychological relativism. As Frege put it, "neither logic nor
mathematics has the task of investigating minds and contents of
consciousness owned by individual men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The philosophy of
mind, in other words, was not reducible to the philosophy of actual
human minds; the apodictic or a priori character of certain universal
truths was not the same as the empirical and a posteriori character of
contingent knowledge. "2 + 2 = 4" and the law of contradiction were
entirely independent of the minds that held them. The truth content of
propositions had to be rigorously separated from the judgments made
about them, judgments that would be better understood as correct or
incorrect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The sense of a proposition, to put it slightly
differently, had to be distinguished from its presentation or
representation; confirmation and refutation were not the same as
persuasion. Moreover, whereas psychological laws could never be more
than vague and probabilistic, based as they were on inductive
generalizations, the laws of logic and mathematics were valid,
timeless, and pure; the latter could not therefore be derived from the
former.

<p>
Husserl, to be sure, ultimately paid more attention than did Frege to
the links between disembodied, timeless Mind and the actual cognition
of real human beings; the ideal realm of logic and mathematics could,
after all, manifest itself in the finite, but rational, consciousness
of fallible mortals. If not, he reasoned, we could have no access to
it. There is thus a possibility of eidetic intuition, Husserl claimed,
which <b></b> provided the immediate evidence of essential
objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Achieving such intuition was, in fact, the point
of his phenomenological rather than strictly logical method with its
continuing debt to Brentano's notion of intentionality. He thus
returned to a variant of the transcendentalism that Frege scorned.
Nonetheless, both he and Frege resisted the reduction of objective to
subjective ideas, understood either as generalizations from empirical
experience or the product of mere introspection into the individual
self.

<p>
They also shared a strong hostility to what they claimed was the
psychologistic confusion of cause and justification, the genetic
fallacy that understood validity in terms of origin. Whereas
psychologism was determined to reduce logic and mathematics to a prior
psychological disposition or the cumulative weight of successive
experiences, they wanted to disentangle one from the other. As Frege
admonished his readers,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
never let us take a description of the origin of an idea for a
definition, or an account of the mental and physical conditions on
which we become conscious of a proposition for a proof of it. A
proposition may be thought, and again it may be true; let us never
confuse these two things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Logic and mathematics had timeless validity, which meant their origins
or causes were irrelevant to their intrinsic truth content.

<p>
How ultimately compelling these criticisms of psychologism may be
cannot be decided here. There are, in fact, still heated disputes
among philosophers, and defenses have been mounted by positing
alternative versions of psychology that allegedly escape its
pitfalls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 What is important for our purposes is the
remarkable extent of its success in the very decades when aesthetic
modernism was itself emerging, from the 1890s through World War
I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Indeed, its power remained strong well into the era
after World War II. Its echo can, for example, still be clearly heard
in one of the most powerful theoretical defenses of modernism made in
the 1960s, Theodor W. Adorno's <I>Aesthetic Theory</I>. Speaking of
the psychoanalysis of works of art in particular, Adorno writes, "it
neglects to consider their real objectivity, their inner consistency,
their level of form, their critical impulses, their relation to
non-psychic reality and, last but not least, their truth
content."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>


<p>
For certain modernist artists as well, the threat to the integrity of
the work of art and its timeless truth value posed by psychologism was
also a palpable reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 There was a modernist "mystique
of purity," which, as Renato Poggioli noted many years ago, 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
aspires to abolish the discursive and syntactic element, to liberate
art from any connection with psychological and empirical reality, to
reduce every work to the intimate laws of its own expressive essence
or to the given absolutes of its own genre or means.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
A displaced variant of the time-honored struggle to maintain a
boundary between the sacred and the profane, this aspiration can also
be understood as yet another <b></b> instance of what sociologists have
seen as the uneven process of differentiating value spheres
characteristic of modernization as a whole. At certain times, the
dislocations produced by that process seem to have been especially
acute, resulting in a struggle over boundary maintenance or
reconration that was particularly fierce. The late nineteenth
century in Europe was by all accounts a period in which the cards,
cultural as well as social, were being rapidly shuffled in new and
threatening ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>


<p>
The threats that resulted in the generalization of anti-psychologism
beyond the confines of philosophy were multifarious: for example, the
expansion of confidence in natural science produced a scientistic
hubris that threatened the value of other approaches to reality; the
extension of new forms of popular commodified culture appealing to the
desires and fantasies of the masses menaced the allegedly
disinterested real of high art; and the challenge to traditional
gender roles in the fin-de-si&egrave;cle created anxieties about the
domination of masculine conceptions of cultural value. Modernism, as
Andreas Huyssen has shown, often defended itself against a feminized
version of mass culture, which it stigmatized as debased
kitsch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Not surprisingly, one weapon in its battle with
these demons was the exorcism of psychologism in the name of a
universalism that would, however, be based on non-scientific values.

<p>
Perhaps the most explicit manifestation of the struggle against
psychologism appeared in the development of modernist literature in
Britain around the time of World War I. In virtually all accounts of
the evolution of British poetry from Yeats to Pound, Ford, and Eliot,
the search for something called "impersonality" and the suppression of
subjective expressivity has been duly recognized.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

Although the tangled web of attitudes towards subjective expression
and objective presentation in the history of British modernism has
prevented the story from being a straightforward narrative of
one-dimensional anti-psychologism, it is nonetheless clear that the
anxieties we have traced in Frege, Husserl, and the neo-Kantians were
given aesthetic voice in the work and theory of the major res in
that story.

<p>
In fact, the explicit importance of Husserl's critique of psychologism
for the poetry and criticism of the influential critic and poet T. E.
Hulme has been widely acknowledged. Although it took some time to
disentangle Hulme's initial enthusiasm for Bergson's philosophy of
flux and immediate experience from his later, very different
position--an entanglement abetted by the ensemble
publication of essays from his entire career in the collection
entitled <I>Speculations</I>, posthumously appearing in
1924--there seems to be a consensus now that he had shifted
his opinion in the years directly before the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Partly
due to the relentless critique of Bergsonism as hopelessly romantic
and simplistically democratic, made by Pierre Lasserre, Charles
Maurras, and other neoclassicist stalwarts of the right-wing Action
Fran&ccedil;aise, Hulme's change of heart also reflected a reading of
Husserl's attack on psychologism in the <I>Logical Investigations</I>,
which apparently allowed him to understand for the first time the
implications of the anti-idealist realism he had encountered in the
analytical philosophy of G. E. Moore and Bertrand
Russell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Liberally citing the German philosopher in the
essay that opened <I>Speculations</I>, "Humanism <b></b> and the
Religious Attitude," a version of which had been already published in
1915, Hulme decried the entire trend of modern thought from the
Renaissance on as distressingly anthropomorphic, based on the mistaken
reduction of objective ideas to a merely human source, the confusion
of pure philosophy with <I>Weltanschauung</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 

<p>
But Hulme went beyond Frege and Husserl's critique of psychologism in
a crucial way: he applied their argument outside of the realm of logic
per se. Citing Moore's <I>Principa Ethica</I> of 1903, with its
celebrated critique of the naturalist fallacy, Hulme argued that
ethical values as well should be understood as irreducible to human
construction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 It was possible, he contended (without
bothering to demonstrate how), to arrange them in an objective
hierarchy. A parallel argument loosely derived from Wilhelm
Worringer's 1908 <I>Abstraction and Empathy</I> allowed Hulme to
denounce aesthetic styles based on intersubjective empathy (or more
precisely, on a subject's pantheistic empathy with a beautiful object
in the world) as inherently inferior to those, such as Egyptian or
Byzantine, which resisted naturalistic organicism in the name of
impersonal, geometrical, non-vitalist abstraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Modern
art, exemplified by the sculpture of Jacob Epstein and the paintings
of C&eacute;zanne and Wyndham Lewis, Hulme argued, promised a return
to precision, austerity, and bareness, the anti-humanist values he so
admired.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 It would help clean up the mess produced by
transgressing boundaries, that "pot of treacle over the dinner table"
Hulme famously identified with the "spilt religion" that was
romanticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<p>
This is not the place and I am not the scholar to present a detailed
and nuanced account of the complicated resonances of Hulme's ideas
among the English modernists, especially the Imagist
poets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Nor can we pause to consider related developments
in the modernist novel from Flaubert to Virginia Woolf, in which
stylistic innovations like the <I>style indirect libre</I> helped
create the effect of non-egocentric impersonality in ways that
parallelled developments in the poetry of the modern era.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

And we cannot open up once again the debate about spatial form in
modern poetry and the novel launched by Joseph Frank, who acknowledged
an explicit debt to Hulme and Worringer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 What, however,
needs to be at least briefly underlined is the pivotal role of a
re of inestimable importance who acknowledged an explicit debt to
Hulme and through him to Frege and Husserl: T. S. Eliot.

<p>
In his new journal, <I>The Criterion</I>, and elsewhere, Eliot
energetically promulgated many of Hulme's ideas, aesthetic as well as
political. In such celebrated essays as "Tradition and the Individual
Talent" of 1919, he presented many of the same anti-psychologistic
arguments we have already encountered. "Poetry," he contended in lines
that quickly became canonical, "is not a turning loose of emotion but
an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality but an
escape from personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 His influential notion of an
"objective correlative" seems likely, in fact, to have been taken
directly from Husserl, whom Eliot read when he studied philosophy at
Harvard in 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Although his obvious debt to the F. H.
Bradley on whom he wrote his dissertation has been widely
acknowledged, Eliot also drew on the work of Meinong, Russell, and
Moore and the other so-called "new realists" of the
period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 According to Sanford Schwartz, "in his thesis he
undermines the assumptions of the <b></b> psychologist by reducing
consciousness to its objects, and later used the same strategy in his
critique of nineteenth-century poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Eliot, Schwartz
also shows, went on to criticize an equally abstract objectivism,
which reified objects as a simple inverse of the romantic reification
of the integral subject; he was clearly no naturalist seeing art as a
passive reflection of an external world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The poet's
ability to fashion words from his immediate experience somehow
overcame the very dichotomy between subject and object, challenging as
well the infamous "dissociation of sensibility" that Eliot claimed had
plagued the modern world ever since the English Revolution placed
feeling above wit. 

<p>
Through the dissemination of Eliot's ideas by the New Critics of the
1930s and 1940s, impersonality became a new dogma and the isolation of
the poem from its contexts of production and reception an article of
faith. Like the logic Frege had hoped to rescue from its
psychologistic reduction and the ethical imperatives Hulme had sought
to distinguish from the humans who followed or transgressed them,
aesthetic value, often equated entirely with formal
self-referentiality, became an end entirely in itself. The New
Critics's dreaded genetic and affective fallacies and the fallacy of
expressive form were all little more than redescriptions in poetic
terms of the warnings against psychologism made by late
nineteenth-century philosophy. Even when later champions of modernism
like Charles Altieri sought to reintroduce a notion of agency, they
were careful to distinguish the structuring activity of the artist
from the emotional interiority of the empirical, suffering subject
lurking beneath its surface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<p>
All of this is by now well known and needs no belaboring. But what
perhaps warrants some attention is the parallel process that can be
discerned in the visual arts during this period. Not surprisingly, the
value of hard-edged visual distinctness, which Hulme and the Imagists
defended as a metaphoric antidote to the sloppy pantheistic
continuities they saw in romanticism, could easily be adopted in
literal terms by painters anxious to experiment with geometric
abstractions and fields of color.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Despite the powerful
subjectivist impulse in certain visual modernisms, most obviously
German Expressionism, others manifested the same suspicion of
psychological expression that we have noted in literary modernists
like Eliot. 

<p>
The nineteenth century, to be sure, can be said to have been, by and
large, a period of the increasing psychologization of the visual, the
abandonment of a geometric optics of representation based on the eye's
ability faithfully to mirror the world outside. The story of how,
beginning in the second decade of the nineteenth century, scientists
of perception undermined the classical observer modeled on the
automatic functioning of a camera obscura has been masterfully
reconstructed by Jonathan Crary in his recent <I>Techniques of the
Observer</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 No longer a monological, punctual,
mechanical eye coolly recording a world outside itself, the new
spectator was embodied, binocular, and influenced by internal
psycho-physiological processes such as afterimages, the presence of
sensations without any simultaneous external stimulus. The
psychologization of vision, the loss of confidence in the veracity of
the eye and such systems of representation as Renaissance perspective,
affected art history and <b></b> criticism as well as practice. Thus, in
his influential <I>Principles of Art History </I>of 1915, Heinrich
W&ouml;lfflin would write of the oscillating pattern of classical and
baroque styles he saw as a constant of visual representation: "There
is no denying it--the development of the process is
psychologically intelligible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>


<p>
The delayed artistic repercussions of the changes Crary details in the
early part of the century can be found most readily in the "glancing,"
embodied, and dynamic--as opposed to "gazing," disembodied,
static--eye of Impressionism, to borrow Norman Bryson's
well-known distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 It has thus been easy for
commentators on the literary offshoots of psychological empiricism,
such as Judith Ryan, to find compelling parallels between them and
Impressionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Both suggest a withdrawal from the world
of stable objects and a new preoccupation with the perceiving subject,
a subject in crisis, absorbed by its own dissolution, fascinated and
sometimes bewildered by the flux of sensations flooding in from
without.

<p>
It is, however, with the loose and amorphous body of work that has
become known as post-Impressionism, and with the painting of
C&eacute;zanne in particular, that these parallels begin to break
down. Indeed, it might be said that the famous "doubt" that
Merleau-Ponty detected in C&eacute;zanne was directed not only towards
the traditional perspectival order of the Renaissance frozen gaze, but
also towards the adequacy of the Impressionists' glancing
eye.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 His attempt to return to objects and paint "nature"
was not, however, a restoration of earlier representational realism;
instead, it sought the real entirely on the surface of the canvas,
where subject and object, perception and the perceived, were not yet
distinct and separate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Here a world of pure monstrance,
of visual presence rather than representation, began to supplant the
sensationalist psychologism of the Impressionists. Although
Merleau-Ponty thought C&eacute;zanne had anticipated what later
psychologists, such as the Gestaltists, were to realize in their
laboratories, his description of the painter's achievement suggests a
less psychologistic interpretation: "The lived object is not
rediscovered or constructed on the basis of the contributions of the
senses; rather it presents itself to us from the start as the center
from which these contributions radiate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>


<p>
C&eacute;zanne's project to capture viewer and viewed together on the
flat surface of the canvas and thus realize unmediated visual presence
may have been utopian, but it provided a challenge to the psychologism
that had come to dominate nineteenth-century spectatorship (a
challenge, as Altieri has argued, that had an impact on modernist
poetry as well).
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Thierry de Duve describes that challenge
in terms of a difficult choice: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Modernity picked up C&eacute;zanne's heritage in the form of an
alternative: either I actively destroy the object, the re, and all
the realism that goes along with it, in order to preserve that which
remains of my subjective integrity--here I have no other
choice than to destroy the represented real, but at least
in destroying it I make myself master of it--or I agree to
sacrifice my subjective unity and allow the plural significance of my
self-image to appear, but to the benefit of an unalterable
pseudo-object, the self-sufficient epiphany of a world that excludes
me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<b></b>

<p>
At different times, different movements and res opted for one or
the other of these alternatives (and some, to be sure, sought to
overcome them by somehow including a dispersed notion of subjectivity
in the epiphany itself).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 But it is perhaps legitimate to
say that in the long run most modernist painting, at least as it
became canonically described in the criticism of Roger Fry, Clive
Bell, Clement Greenberg, and Michael Fried, took the second course.
That is, it sought to purge painting of anything allegedly superfluous
to it, any expression of the painter's interiority, any
representational reference, decorative functionality, or theatrical
appeal to the beholder. Instead, painting came increasingly to be
understood as a quest to realize only the essential and immanent laws
of painting themselves, a quest for an authentic, truth-telling art
that would be ontologically "absolute." Even when that absolute was
understood in spiritual terms, as it was by Kandinsky, it meant the
extirpation of the psychological subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Very much in
the spirit of Kant's defense of logic as understanding "in agreement
with itself," high modernism became a game of purification and
reduction in which formal pictorial qualities were their own
ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Indeed, for Greenberg, Kant himself was "the first
real Modernist" because he "used logic to establish the limits of
logic, and while he withdrew much from its old jurisdiction, logic was
left in all the more secure possession of what remained to
it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>


<p>
Not surprisingly, the aesthetic variant of this strategy of <I>reculer
pour mieux sauter</I>, most explicitly realized in the writing of
Greenberg after his break with Marxism, often earned a comparison with
the New Criticism that was the scholarly handmaiden of literary
modernism at this time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Greenberg's explicit embrace of
Eliot's banishment of personality from aesthetic judgment was also
remarked, as was the similarity between his position and that of
Adorno.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Although Eliot's later ruminations on culture and
tradition suggest a more hermeneutic, contextual perspective, both he
and Greenberg could be seen as championing self-reflexivity and
self-absorption, in which the aesthetic object is rigidly segregated
from anything outside its apparent boundaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>


<p>
The anti-psychologistic impulse in the Greenbergian version of high
modernism is thus not difficult to discern. More surprising is that
something similar can be detected in the work of a modernist re,
who fell entirely outside of the canon established by Greenberg and
the other champions of optical purity and self-sufficiency: Marcel
Duchamp. What has been called his "pictorial nominalism," which
perhaps became most explicit when Duchamp began fashioning his
celebrated "readymades," meant foregrounding the constitutive power of
the artist, who named an object an artwork through an act of
enunciation ultimately valorized by the institutions of art rather
than by his own genius or skill.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Eschewing the search for
optical purity, indeed truculently indifferent to any optical values,
and hostile to the search for the "absolute" essence of the medium of
painting, Duchamp was in many respects the antithesis of the artist
who hopes for the epiphanous revelation of a self-sufficient world on
the flat surface of his canvas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Instead, he promoted the
invasion of the realm of the visual by the textual and discursive,
allowed the real world literally <b></b> to appear through the surface of
the "canvas" (the <I>Large Glass</I> was a transparent "window"
mocking both the old metaphor of the canvas as window and the new
celebration of its two-dimensional opacity), and foregrounded the
persona of the artist, whose unstable identity registered the crisis
of the genius model of creativity.

<p>
And yet, despite his radical problematizing of the mainstream
modernist quest for pure visual presence and his deliberate mockery of
its ontological pretensions, Duchamp was, I want to argue, equally
suspicious of certain versions of psychologism in art. His famous
dismissal of "retinal painting" was aimed at the positing of the
painter's or beholder's eye, whether gazing or glancing, as the
foundation of aesthetic value. His nominalism extended, we might say,
to the perception of the artist, whose sensitively recorded act of
ephemeral seeing was no less a questionable standard of veracity than
the idealized representation of objects allegedly present in the
visual field of a disembodied, camera obscura gaze.

<p>
Duchamp was even more antagonistic to an aesthetic of expressivity,
arguing instead for an anti-romantic art of dehumanization. As Werner
Hofmann has noted, "his act of choice consciously opposed the
glorification of subjective creation and the principle which holds
that the lowly object is ennobled by artistic
'expression.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Not surprisingly, in the 1950s Duchamp
took to quoting T. S. Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent,"
with its famous distinction between the "man who suffers" and "the
mind who creates," and told one critic in 1961 that "Eliot's essay
presents his own feelings as well or better than he himself has ever
done in writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 In short, even so maverick a re in
the pantheon of modernism as Marcel Duchamp felt obliged to distance
himself from the lure of psychologism.

<p>
Duchamp and Eliot, to be sure, are certainly an odd couple and can
only remain together in a tense constellation for a short while before
they begin to drift apart. Duchamp, in fact, has emerged in the past
few decades as the quintessential critic of modernist pretensions to
formalist purity, optical essentialism, and the integrity of the
medium. Although he may have called into question expressive notions
of genius and disparaged the empirical perception of the artist, his
own role in dismantling the Greenbergian consensus has been
increasingly written in heroic terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 So too the
personal, often erotic traces in his work have come to the fore, in
ways that invite the charge of a renewed psychologism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>


<p>
The postmodern appropriation of Duchamp, in fact, would not feel
offended by this charge, for one of the most explicit dividing lines
between modernism and its putative successor is precisely their
differing attitudes towards psychologism. Indeed, in one sense,
postmodernism can be said to be a "second psychologism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP> Its return seems to have 
been prepared by the widespread
recognition that the modernist project of ruthless purification had
reached a dead end, as there was little interesting left to write or
paint about once all contaminations were banished. The indifference to
human suffering that seemed too often to accompany the modernist
differentiation of value spheres also made many uneasy, as the extent
of the modernist entanglement with fascism became clearer. Similarly,
the modernist pretensions to disinterestedness have seemed
increasingly hollow in the face of multiculturalist <b></b> and feminist
critiques of its <I>soi-disant</I> universalism, as well as the
sociological claim that aesthetic value is really just another name
for "cultural capital."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 And finally, the threat of a
scientistic version of psychology seemed less pressing once the
literary and hermeneutic dimensions of psychoanalysis came to the
fore.

<p>
The recent return to some form of psychologism is, in fact, evident in
philosophy itself, where a reaction against the privileging of
self-identical logic has taken many forms, among them a new
sensitivity to the impact of the institutional context of the
discipline on its subject matter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 The neopragmatism of 
Richard Rorty is a salient example of a renewed distrust of the
fallacy that defenders of psychologism had once mockingly dubbed
"logicism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 In <I>Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature</I>, he notes with satisfaction that,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
seventy years after Husserl's "Philosophy as Rigorous Science" and
Russell's "Logic as the Essence of Philosophy," we are back with the
same putative dangers which faced the authors of these manifestoes: if
philosophy becomes too naturalistic, hard-nosed 
positive disciplines will nudge it aside; if it becomes too
historicist, then intellectual history, literary criticism, and
similar soft spots in "the humanities" will swallow it
up.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Rorty's plea is to stop worrying in the face of these putative dangers
and accept the inevitable blurring of the lines between philosophy and
its scientific and historicist neighbors. Heeding his message, some of
his pragmatist followers have reread the modernist tradition itself in
the hope of resituating its res in the new context; one has gone
so far as to try to rescue even T. S. Eliot by turning him into a
closet pragmatist, who ultimately came to believe in the virtues of
historical tradition and practical wisdom over logical (or aesthetic)
truth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>


<p>
Deconstruction has likewise taken aim at Husserl's attempt to use
eidetic intuition to provide an avenue of entry into the timeless
world of logical truth. Derrida's <I>Speech and Phenomena</I> begins
with an attack on the confusions of a transcendental psychologism that
seeks to exclude precisely those intrusions from without that any
psychologism necessitates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 Gleefully extolling the very
contamination and pollution that so troubled critics of psychologism,
celebrating the temporal deferral and traces of the past that the
fetish of spatial form in modernism hoped to keep at bay, restoring
modified respect for the representation and mimesis that modernist
self-reflexivity had banished, deconstruction transgresses many of the
same boundaries that nineteenth-century psychologism had also
violated.

<p>
Its effects on literary critical attitudes towards psychologism have
been evident. Although eschewing any strong notion of the expressive
subject and no less suspicious of humanist pieties than Hulme and
Eliot were, deconstruction has reversed the New Critics' disdain for
romanticism and reintroduced complicated notions of
intentionality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 One need only mention New Historicism,
reception aesthetics, the pervasive influence of Nietzsche, and the
proliferation of psychoanalytically informed approaches to reinforce
the same point: the taboo against psychologism now seems firmly laid
to rest among literary critics. Or more precisely, many have come to
feel at home in a gray area between the absolute alternatives of a
maximalist <b></b> psychologistic reductionism, in which all mental
activity and all cultural artifacts are merely an expression of
emotional states, and an anti-psychologistic purism, in which
everything of value must be protected against any pollution from
without.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>


<p>
Indeed, one of the reasons it may be meaningful to distinguish between
modernism and postmodernism, however volatile that distinction may be,
is the recent undermining of the taboo, which operated so powerfully
during the modernist era. As I hope is now evident, "psychologism,"
with all of its connotations of reductionism, contamination, and
relativism, became one of the main anxieties of that era, a veritable
"specter," as one recent commentator has called it, haunting the
modernist mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Postmodernists, in contrast, seem more
relaxed and untroubled by these dangers, having learned to live with
the ghosts of the past rather than trying to exorcise them. Although
they hold no brief for the notion of an integrated subject, whose
individual psychology can be the genesis of art, they feel comfortable
with a dispersed and decentered subjectivity whose impulses, desires,
fetishes, and fantasies disturb the smooth workings of any cultural
sublimation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>


<p>
But to give the screw one final turn, postmodernism may itself be
haunted by a specter of its own, which refuses to die: the ghost of
modernist anti-psychologism. Some contemporary philosophers of mind
still struggle, after all, to produce a transcendental account of
consciousness that will establish the autonomy of at least mathematics
and logic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 Certain ethical theorists continue to balk at
the "emotivist" reduction of moral imperatives to personal
preferences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 And what Adorno liked to call the "truth
content of art" stubbornly refuses to lose its fascination for those
unwilling to level all aesthetic distinctions and reduce all judgments
to matters of individual taste.

<p>
If Derrida is right in claiming that the specter of Marx still haunts
our apparently post-Marxist world, the same might well be the case for
the anti-psychologism that flourished during the heyday of
modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 As the continuing wars over multiculturalism
and the canon testify, it would be premature to believe that the
pressures that produced the fear of psychologism have entirely
subsided, or that the search for aesthetic value is entirely a thing
of the past. Whatever the future of the debate, one thing is clear: it
would be a serious mistake to ignore the creative energies unleashed
by the effort to fend off psychologism during the previous era. For
even if it now seems a losing battle, or its outcome at best a
stalemate, the struggle was an indisputable ingredient in the making
of that remarkable phenomenon we call modern art.

The most recent and complete account of the debate over
"psychologism" can be found in Martin Kusch, <I>Psychologism: A Case
Study of the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge</I> (New York:
Routledge, 1995). He notes that the term itself was coined by Johann
Eduard Erdmann in his <I>Grundrisse der Geschiche der Philosophie</I>
(Berlin: W. Hertz, 1866). A Hegelian, Erdmann introduced the term to
describe the work of Friedrich Eduard Beneke, but did not actively
criticize it (Kusch, <I>Psychologism</I>, 101).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT6" HREF="#REF6">6</a>.
It would also be possible to make a case based on musical examples,
beginning with Eduard Hanslick's defense of "absolute music,"
continuing through the post-Wagnerian rejection of romanticism, and
culminating in Schoenberg's twelve-tone row. If Ortega y Gasset is
right in his well-known analysis of the modernism "dehumanization of
art," the pivotal re was Debussy. For a recent discussion of
anti-psychologistic impulses in Stravinsky, see Richard Taruskin, "A

impact in Germany through such res as Johann Nicolaus Tetens,
whose <I>Philosophische Versuche &uuml;ber die menschliche Natur und

Although Durkheim's sociology, echoing that of Auguste Comte, was
more resolutely hostile to methodological individualism than Weber's,
even the latter insisted that a proper sociological explanation of
behavior was irreducible to psychological states of mind. Dilthey's
attitude towards psychologism was intensified by his reading of
Husserl's <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>, but he showed signs of
skepticism as early as 1860. See the discussion in Michael Ermarth,

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT15" HREF="#REF15">15</a>.
Kusch, in <I>Psychologism</I>, shows how loose and amorphous the
debate was, with almost every re on both sides of the fence,
including Husserl himself, being accused of some variety of
psychologism. He situates the debate in the context of the
institutional challenge to philosophy presented by the rise of
experimental psychology, exemplified by Wilhelm Wundt, Hermann
Ebbinghaus, Georg Elias M&uuml;ller, and Carl Stumpf, in the 1880s.

the first to underline in his "Husserl's Notion of Noema,"<I> Journal

analytical and phenomenological traditions shared a common root in
anti-psychologism (although Frege was more important for the
analytical tradition and Husserl for the continental). Here the
celebrated gap between Anglo-American and continental philosophy
yawned far less widely than is normally assumed. This is not to deny,
of course, that some later philosophers in these traditions reopened
the question of the links between psychology and philosophy, e.g.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose debts to Gestalt psychology are evident.

Lucien Goldmann, to take one example, was hostile to psychologism
only when it meant the individual, libidinal psyche. But he supported
the idea of a collective, cognitive psyche and derided neo-Kantians
for their attempt to deny any human origins to the objects of
knowledge. See his <I>Immanuel Kant</I>, trans. Robert Black (London:
NLB, 1971), 153-56. In general, Marxist critics of psychologism
refused the absolutizing of logic evident in Frege, the neo-Kantians,
and Husserl, which they saw as the acceptance of reification. Their
anti-psychologism only meant a resistance to understanding the subject
of knowledge in psychological rather than trans-individual, social
terms.

Kusch argues that the war itself, at least in Germany, produced a
general intellectual consensus that stilled the battle over
psychologism, leaving phenomenology the winner. The war also provided
a new role for experimental psychology as an applied discipline, which
took its practitioners away from philosophical disputes. Those who
remained in philosophy departments in a general atmosphere that was
anti-scientific and anti-atomistic made their peace with the reigning
orthodoxy. See Kusch, <I>Psychologism</I>, chapter eight.

argues, "works of art necessarily evolve in a dialectic of interests
and disinterestedness" (<I>Aesthetic Theory</I>, 17). Earlier, Adorno
provided an equally dialectical treatment of Husserl's one-sided

pollution conform to his definition of modernist, whereas those who
were less anxious, for example the Surrealists, were members of the
avant-garde that sought to reconcile life and art.

Sovereignty of the Artist 1885-1925</I> (New York: Atheneum,

ultimately means that "authority of style was based not on the

modernist elitism, but he neglects the opposite connection, which ties
anti-psychologism with misogyny. By isolating works from the contexts

fiction that they were timeless, universal creations undisturbed by

Among certain German neo-Kantians, most notably the Heidelberg

(<I>Werte</I>) rather than mere validity (<I>Geltung</I>) had also
been conducted. But Hulme does not seem to have been influenced

Wilhelm Worringer, <I>Abstraction and Empathy: A Contribution to
the Psychology of Style</I>, trans. Michael Bullock (New York:

indicates, Worringer was actually interested in providing a
psychological explanation for the stylistic dispositions of different
artists and periods of the kind Hulme disdained. For recent analyses
of the complicated reception of Worringer's work, see Neil H. Donahue,
ed., <I>Invisible Cathedrals: The Expressionist Art History of Wilhelm
Worringer</I> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
1995).

<p>
Aesthetic empathy, it should be noted, had been most extensively
defended by the German philosopher Theodor Lipps. As Levenson notes, 

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
Lipps also appeared in Husserl's <I>Logical Investigations</I>, where
he is criticized as a proponent of psychologism. Indeed, Worringer's
argument against Lipps and on behalf of abstraction bears notable
similarities of Husserl's defense of 'pure logic,' and although I know
of no evidence of any contact or influence, the theories of the two
res meet in Hulme's enthusiastic embrace. [<I>A Genealogy of
Modernism</I>, 96]

A similar argument, with a far less positive evaluation, was
famously made in 1925 by Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset, <I>The

Hulme, <I>Speculations</I>, 118. Romanticism blundered by trying
to realize perfection, which belongs only to the religious sphere, in
human affairs. Modern art wisely sought its perfection only in the
sphere of art and eschewed the romantics' redemptive hope of
transring life as well.

As Antoine Compagnon writes, "initially, in the mind of the first

psychology extinct, to explore a world of meanings and energies, and
to produce images with which we would all be able to commune
spiritually" (Antoine Compagnon, <I>The Five Paradoxes of

169f. Noting Greenberg's Jewish anxiety about assimilation, he
compares it with Eliot's Anglo-Catholicism, and concludes that 

<p><blockquote><!--_extract-->
Greenberg's similar insistence on the aesthetic "extinction of
personality," and his 
determination to purge from art all traces of mundane existence, for
which kitsch became the shorthand term, reflect not so much a
political or even art-historical perspective, as they do a
fundamentally religious one. Located against the backdrop of Jewish
emigration from the shtetl and the ghetto, the opposition of purity
and impurity stands as a metaphor for the perilous choices imposed by
cultural assimilation in the New World. [Storr, "Greenberg's
Modernism," 175]. 
<!--_/extract--></blockquote>
<p>
Situated in the context of the anti-psychologistic tradition as a
whole, however, Greenberg's values seem less quirkily reflective of
his own personal predicament.
<p>
<p>
For a comparison between Greenberg and Adorno, see Compagnon, <I>The

See, for example, Rosalind E. Krauss, <I>The Optical
Unconscious</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1993), chapter three, in
which Duchamp is presented as introducing carnal desire rather than
cerebral reflexivity into his art. She explicitly contrasts his work
to the ascetic, contemplative aesthetics of Bloomsbury theorists such
as Robert Fry, which she claims was derived from G. E. Moore's
anti-psychologistic ethics. A very different account, which
nonetheless also stresses the psychological sources of his work, can
be found in Jerrold Seigel, <I>The Private Worlds of Marcel
Duchamp</I> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).
According to Seigel, "behind Duchamp's claim to have devoted his
career to destabilizing his personality, countering the pull of taste
and habit with an aesthetic of indifference and avoiding the trap of
fixed identity by his various stages of self-contradiction, there
lurked an uncompromising exaltation of the self" (<I>The Private
Worlds of Marcel Duchamp</I>, 206). This self, however, was less a
sovereign maker than a chooser, who worked with the "givens" provided
by chance or the debris of the culture around him.

Shusterman, <I>T. S. Eliot and the Philosophy of Criticism</I>,
chapter eight. In an earlier essay, "Remembering Hulme: A Neglected
Philosopher-Critic-Poet," Shusterman tries to do the same for the
re who has been taken as the quintessential anti-psychologist. His
evidence, however, is basically limited to one aphorism in the
unfinished collection entitled <I>Cinders</I>, which Herbert Read
included in <I>Speculations</I>, which begins "The truth is that there
are no ultimate principles, upon which the whole of knowledge can be
built once and for ever as upon a rock . . . " (Hulme,
<I>Speculations</I>, 233-34). On this basis, Shusterman claims
Hulme was close to Rorty in his anti-foundationalist stress on the
priority of <I>Weltanschauungen</I> to absolute truth. Putting aside
the performative contradiction entailed in a sentence against absolute
truth that begins "the truth is . . . , " Hulme, it seems to me, was
attacking the humanist pretension to combine cognitive, ethical, and
religious knowledge in one grand system, not the possibility of
foundations in separate spheres. His appeal for strict discontinuity
between those spheres and belief in the authority of revealed religion
in value questions makes him a far cry from Rorty's philosophy of
relativist edification.
