"In the arts an appetite for a new look is now a
professional requirement,
as in
Russia to be accredited as a revolutionist is to qualify for
privileges,"
wrote
Harold Rosenberg, the champion of action painting, in 1960.
Densely packed
with
ironies intended and unintended, Rosenberg's marvelous
sentence
encapsulates the
atmosphere in which many members of the generation now
reaching seniority
in the
arts and the academy were educated. Indeed, it is tempting
now to look
back on
that period as if on some kind of Brezhnevite stagnation, in
which
yesterday's
antitraditionalist sloganeering was appropriated to defend
today's
reactionary
traditionalism, and in which loyalty to the new was
professed in order to
resist
change. The attempt to marry the Permanent Revolution to the
Great
Tradition led
to a vast proliferation of newspeak and doublethink, for as
Rosenberg went
on to
observe, "the new cannot become a tradition without giving
rise to unique
contradictions, myths, absurdities."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
We are still living with them. The historiography of
art--and
particularly, it
seems, of music--remains the most stubbornly Whiggish of all
historiographies,
despite longstanding maverick opposition.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
That
historiography is
still a Tradition-of-the-New narrative that celebrates
technical
innovation,
viewed as progress within a narrowly circumscribed aesthetic
domain. The
hermetic
and formalist side of this paradigm and the heroically
individualistic,
asocial
side of it remain sources 



 of
dissatisfaction to those of us who believe
that this
manner of accounting for the production and the value of
artworks has had a
deleterious influence on that very production and that very
value.

<p>
 Awareness has been growing that the two sides of the
enduring paradigm are
codependent, that in both aspects the resulting narratives
have been
tendentiously exclusionary, and that the ideology of the
cold war, which
sanctioned the association of logical positivism with
democracy and of
formalism
with the defense of political freedom, has been to a
long-unrecognized
extent
their artificial life-support system. The influence of the
cold war on
modernist
attitudes in Rosenberg's field has been energetically
documented of late,
sometimes with a tinge of conspiracy theorizing.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The single
noteworthy attempt of this kind so far in the field of music
has been an
article
by Martin Brody, "'Music for the Masses': Milton Babbitt's
Cold War Music
Theory," in which Babbitt's scientism is somewhat benignly
explained as a
defense, on the part of a thinker formed (and scarred) by
the "dangerously
irrational" ideological battles of the 1930s, against a
priori (which is
to say
political) constraints on conceptualizing "the nature and
limits of music"
and
against the political exploitability of any "looser," less
intransigently
rationalistic discourse.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Will the end of the cold war spell the end of all these
redemptive
mythologies
and exclusionary strategies? Will we finally get beyond the
poietic
fallacy that
focuses all attention on the making of the artwork, hence on
the person
(and the
putative freedoms) of the maker? Will we see that artists's
shoptalk is not
invariably the best model or medium for criticism? Will we
allow that the
context
of technical innovation in the arts need not be confined to
the history of
art?
Will we accept that what an artist will experience as "an
irresistible pull
within the art"
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
may have sources in the wider world,
including some
of which the artist may not be wholly aware, and that it is
the
historian's or
the critic's job to describe them, however fallibly?

<p>
A major deterrent to enlarging the purview of art
historiography and
criticism
along these lines is the unwholesomeness of what might be
discovered, and
the
intolerable implications such discovery may be seen to
harbor. Formalism
has been
a bulwark against such a threat. Its defenders have tended
to impugn the
motives
of skeptics, who are accused of genius-envy and, more
sweepingly, of
hostility to
the integrity of the individual. As one who has
investigated, and who has
felt it
important to investigate, Stravinsky's alarming political
affinities, and
drawn
fire in consequence, I can well appreciate the qualms
expressed by the
author of
a recent inquiry into the occultist wellsprings of modernist
poetry. "This
study
is not a postmodern critique of modernism," he felt it
necessary to
declare. "It
is not my intention to unveil the errors, self-deceptions,
and vices of
those
geniuses whose impossibly great achievements oppress us
all."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
He
knows that he is in for censure from a "scholarly community
[that]
considers it
poor form to dwell upon such an aberration" as occultism,
and the history
of
Scriabin research shows that the musicological community has
been similarly
disposed.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Those who wish to see Scriabin promoted from accredited
crank to accredited
genius are precisely the ones least able to cope with what,
in this case,
were
the composer's 

<B></B>

 acknowledged allegiances
and his professed
purposes.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
And that seems to be because it is precisely his
inseparability from
<I>fin de
si&egrave;cle </I>occultism that has made Scriabin's
canonical status in
the West
so obstinately insecure. When it comes to a central,
uncontested and
incontestable genius of modern music like Stravinsky,
resistance to
cultural
contextualization becomes fiercer yet, especially when that
looming context
involves more than what can be dismissed as private folly,
but links up
with
great public evils, like fascism and anti-Semitism, that
have had gruesome
public
consequences.

<p>
Unlike Scriabin's occultism (or Schoenberg's, for that
matter),
Stravinsky's
fascism and his anti-Semitism were not, as a rule, matters
the composer
saw fit
explicitly to thematize in his work. Although he did choose
to set a
couple of
anti-Semitic texts in his American years, the texts do not
seem to have
been
selected for the sake of their anti-Semitism.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Stravinsky
never made
a setting of the <I>Giovinezza </I>or the <I>Horst Wessel
Lied </I>(but he
did
set <I>The Volga Boatmen's Song </I>on commission from the
liberal
post-Tsarist
pre-Bolshevik provisional government of Russia in 1917, and
he set <I>The
Star-Spangled Banner </I>on his own initiative in 1941).

<p>
In the absence of any explicit indication from the composer,
it cannot
suffice
merely to assert that his social circumstances and political
attitudes
ineluctably shaped his musical output. That amounts to no
more than a
truism,
impervious to falsification and therefore empty of
information. As in the
case of
sexuality--say, Tchaikovsky's or Schubert's (to cite issues
of lively
currency)
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
--the burden of proof must rest with those who
assert the
critical relevance of the connection, and such relevance can
only be
established
on specific terms: what circumstances? what attitudes? how
have they
shaped which
works?

<p>
To the extent that the argument is advanced in terms of
generalities (on
the
level, that is, of "theory"), adherents of the formalist or
autonomist
position
will always be able to maintain, on the basis of its
specificity, the
superiority
of context-free "essential" knowledge;
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
nor will they be in
any way
shaken in their belief that such knowledge, being purely
"aesthetic,"
engages the
art-work without mediation and, hence, obviates any need for
interpretation.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Yet even when successfully demonstrated, the
connection between music and historical situation or between
music and the
wider
world of ideas is not self-evidently enhancing or
illuminating. Asserted
dogmatically, it can amount to a debased form of the
intentional
fallacy--debased
in the sense that it is not even the composer but a mere
surrogate, the
researcher, who now claims the privileged authority of the
creator. Just as
undesirably, it can reduce works to the status of
exemplification. Works
can and
certainly do survive their immediate contexts, and it is the
hermeneutic
position
itself that would uphold their right to change (that is, to
be
reconstituted)
accordingly. Again, cases must be judged on their merits,
with due
reckoning of
gains and losses.

<p>
It is when works "survive" into the twilight zone of
decontextualization--or
recontextualization within the formalist canon--that losses
can seem most
decisively to outweigh gains. Often, and paradoxically, it
is the very
radicalism
of modernist art 

<B></B>

 that is supposed to
vouchsafe its transcendence of
historical
contingency. Reacting to my own historical investigations
concerning
Stravinsky's
patrimony and evolution (and, as often happens, attributing
to me stronger
claims
than I would care to make), Pieter van den Toorn has
declared himself to
be "not
all that certain that this early Russian heritage is
invariably the most
useful
context within which to angle the terms of Stravinsky's
musical
particularity,"
because "what may astonish most about this music is not the
ties that bind
it to
its immediate past but the distance that separates it from
that
past."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Certainly; and yet neither the ties that bind nor the
distance that separates can be realistically gauged without
specific
knowledge of
what Van den Toorn and many others would evidently prefer to
forget.

<p>
Among those who have most loudly chanted the praises of
amnesia was
Stravinsky,
whose squeamishness about his past, and whose rewritings of
it, have become
legend.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
By the latest (Cold War) phase of his career, the
amnesia,
formerly applied selectively and opportunistically, had
become a
generalized
defense against all "extramusical" association. The
following exchange
from the
first book of "conversations" with Robert Craft is
indicative:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>R.C.</I> Have you ever thought that music is, as Auden
says, "a virtual
image
of our experience of living as temporal, with its double
aspect of
recurrence and
becoming?"
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I.S. If music is to me an "image of our experience of living
as temporal,"
(and
however unverifiable, I suppose it is), my saying so is the
result of a
reflection and as such is independent of music itself. But
this kind of
thinking
about music is a different vocation altogether for me: I
cannot do
anything with
it as a truth, and my mind is a doing one . . . . Auden's
"image of our
experience of living as temporal" (which is also an image)
is above music,
perhaps, but it does not obstruct or contradict the purely
musical
experience.
What shocks me however, is the discovery that many people
think below
music.
Music is merely something that reminds them of something
else--of
landscapes, for
example; my Apollo is always reminding someone of Greece.
But in even the
most
specific attempts at evocation, what is meant by being
"like" and what are
"correspondences?" Who, listening to Liszt's precise and
perfect little
Nuages
gris, could pretend that "gray clouds" are a musical cause
and effect?
(CIS, 15)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The first thing to note, in attempting to unpack this
remarkable little
document,
is that the phrase of Auden's from which the composer is at
such pains to
distance himself is in fact a paraphrase--a knowing
paraphrase, one has to
think--of some famous pronouncements by Stravinsky himself.
In his Parisian
autobiography of 1936, <I>Chroniques de ma Vie,
</I>Stravinsky followed his
famous ting words about music's powerlessness "to
<I>express
</I>anything at
all" with an honorable attempt to define not only what music
was not, but
also
what it was. "Music," he then wrote (or had his ghostwriter
write),

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
is the sole domain in which man realizes the present. By the
imperfection
of his
nature, man is doomed to submit to the passage of time--to
its categories
of past
and future--without ever being able to give substance, and
therefore
stability,
to the category of the 

<B></B>

 present. The
phenomenon of music is given to us
with the
sole purpose of establishing an order in things, including,
and
particularly, the
coordination between <I>man</I> and<I> time.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A dozen years
later, at lunch at the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. on
31 March 1948,
Stravinsky surprised Robert Craft, whom he had just met and
who recorded
it in
his diary, with the "marvelous remark" that "music is the
best means we
have of
digesting time." The Stravinskys's other luncheon guest that
day was W. H.
Auden.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
For the interwar and the postwar Stravinskys, then, the
Stravinskys whose third-hand Bergsonian remarks Auden
admired and improved
upon,
music, even if it did not "express," nevertheless signified,
and what it
signified was of the most primal human significance.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The
cold-war
Stravinsky was more exigent; he insisted, not on music as
metaphor, but on
"music
itself" (<I>CIS,</I> 15).

<p>
That is a very strange notion indeed, "music itself." Its
history has yet
to be
written, but it does not seem to be a very long one. In the
sense in which
the
cold-war Stravinsky used the term, it does not seem to
extend back more
than a
decade or two before Stravinsky used it. The term has
nothing to do with
the
nineteenth century's "absolute music," with which it is now
often
mistakenly
interchanged; for the absoluteness of absolute music, as
Wagner (yes,
Wagner)
first envisioned it, was an absolute expressivity, not an
absolute freedom
of
expression.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Stravinsky's first approximation to the term
comes in a
little talk he took around beginning in 1935 to introduce
the concerts at
which
he and his son Sviatoslav (Soulima) gave the initial
performances of the
<I>Concerto per due pianoforti soli. </I>"There are
different ways of
loving and
appreciating music," he would say:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There is, for instance, the way that I would call
self-interested love,
wherein
one demands from music emotions of a general sort--joy,
sorrow, sadness, a
subject for dreaming on, forgetfulness of ordinary
existence. But that
devalues
music by assigning it a utilitarian end. Why not love it for
its own sake?
Why
not love it as one loves a picture, for the sake of the
beautiful
painting, the
beautiful design, the beautiful composition? Why not admit
that music has
an
intrinsic value, independent of the sentiments or images
that it may evoke
by
analogy, and that can only corrupt the hearer's judgment?
Music needs no
help. It
is sufficient unto itself. Don't look for anything else in
it beyond what
it
already contains.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
These are clearly related concepts. Yet to speak of "aimer
la musique pour
elle-m&ecirc;me," or to say that "elle suffit &agrave;
elle-m&ecirc;me,"
is not
at all the same as speaking of "la musique elle-m&ecirc;me,"
something of
which
Stravinsky does not yet seem to have the notion. He is still
speaking
(Kantianly,
one might say) of pure motives and pure attitudes--of
"aestheticism," if
you
like--but not, as yet, of pure essences. (He could hardly
have been doing
that
before concerts in which his <I>Three Tableaux from
Petrushka, </I>played
by
Soulima, shared the program with the new<I> Concerto.</I>)

<p>
The special congeries of notions expressed by tautological
terms like
"music
itself," "the music itself," "music as music," and so on,
came later, at
least to 

<B></B>

Stravinsky. And they came to him in America. They coincide
with his serial
period. (Indeed, he makes a point, in a passage elided from
the Auden
discussion
quoted earlier, of exempting the sort of music he was then
composing from
Auden's
metaphors, even insofar as he accepted them: "if I
understand 'recurrence'
and
'becoming,'" he now stipulated, "their aspect is greatly
diminished in
serial
music" [<I>CIS,</I> 15].)

<p>
So what was this new notion of "music itself," of which the
music of the
cold-war
period was the best and purest exemplar? Commonplace though
the phrase has
become
in everyday parlance, intuitively though we may feel we
understand it, its
definition is intractably elusive--or perhaps it would be
more accurate to
say
protean; for it is never defined except by its context, and
its context is
invariably one of negation. In Stravinsky's response to
Craft, "music
itself" is
defined as being <I>not </I>"the result of a reflection;" it
is <I>not
</I>evocative; it is <I>not </I>a correspondence; it is
"below" the terms
of
Auden's generalization (so it's not that), and "above" such
particular
things as
landscapes and clouds (so it's none of those, either). But
what is it?

<p>
Impossible to say--which is precisely why the term has
become
indispensable in
certain kinds of metamusical discourse. It is the great
instrument of
rejection.
In Joseph Kerman's <I>Contemplating Music, </I>for example,
a book that
had as
its objective precisely the redefinition of musicology's
domain and its
methodology so as to put it in closer touch with "the music
itself," the
concept
is wielded like a bazooka. "Music itself," or "music as
music," or, less
often,
"music in its own terms," we learn, does not consist in
facts about music;
or in
autonomous systems or structure; or in historical
generalizations; or in
texts
("the bare score"); or in "moments in a hypothesized
evolutionary
process"; or in
"art 'objects' susceptible to objective manipulation"; or in
bibliographical
minutiae; or in analytical minutiae; or in music-in-culture
or
music-in-society;
or indeed in any exclusive context.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
What's left? Kerman has excluded the general and the
particular, the
autonomous
and the contextual, the whole and the part. And still, his
negatives do
not equal
Stravinsky's negatives, nor do they suggest similar positive
intuitions,
except
insofar as both writers seem to eliminate the reflective and
associate
"music"
(Kerman tacitly, Stravinsky openly) with some kind of
primary,
inarticulate,
implicitly incommunicable activity. In Kerman's case the
residuum is
performing
and listening; these are the activities to which his
envisaged musicology
(or
"criticism") are accessory. In Stravinsky's case the
privileged activity,
naturally enough, is composing (for him, plain
<I>doing</I>). For both of
them,
ultimately, "music itself" is a chimera, for it is half of a
binarism--one
hand
clapping--of which the other half is an "extramusical." As
in any binarism,
neither term can mean anything in the absence of the other.
Each,
therefore, is
fashioned out of its relationship to the other. (The music
itself is that
which
is not extramusical; the extramusical is that which is not
the music
itself.) And
as always, the need for such constructions lies in the
actions--and the
exclusions--that they enable.

<p>
So perhaps it might be better to say that rather than being
merely
chimerical,
the indefinable but indispensable notion of "music itself"
acts as a
<I>cordon
sanitaire, </I>a 

<B></B>

 quarantine staking out
a decontaminated space within
which music
can be composed, performed and listened to in a cultural and
historical
vacuum,
that is, in perfect sterility.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->
II
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The question remains as to why the quarantine is deemed
necessary. Rather
than go
on theorizing about it, let us observe it in action.
Stravinsky's early
masterpiece <I>The Rite of Spring </I>is the perfect test
case: because its
reputation has achieved genuinely mythic proportions;
because the
mythology of
<I>The Rite </I>has generated a huge and many-sided
literature; and
because so
much of that literature is so easily and instructively
falsified.

<p>
The myth is an eclectic compound of at times contradictory
elements. There
was
the work's sensationally nasty Paris premiere. ("The real
thing--a big
'Paris'
scandal!" critics marvelled or scoffed. "Things got as far
as ting,"
the
composer laconically reported in a letter home.)
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
There were
the
many cheap imitations it inspired. (Robert Craft called
<I>The Rite
</I>"the
prize bull that inseminated the whole modern movement.")
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
There was
the durable enigma of its technical premises, inspiring a
clamor of
irreconcilable analytical hypotheses. The myth of <I>The
Rite </I>is at
once a
myth of iconoclasm and a myth of virgin birth; a myth of
disruption and a
myth of
advancement; a myth of artistic synergy and a myth of
musical autonomy.
Several
books have been devoted to the work by now;
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
but to
appreciate the
myth as such it would be better to look, at the outset, not
at the
specialized
literature or the cutting edge of research, but at the
textbooks that
transmit
and cement the conventional wisdom about <I>The Rite </I>and
about
modernist
music in general.

<p>
Stravinsky's score is always a prime exhibit, and usually
<I>the </I>prime
exhibit, in the early chapters of textbooks on
twentieth-century music.
Two such
textbooks, both straightforwardly entitled
<I>Twentieth-Century Music,
</I>have
been published in the last two years, and can be fairly said
to represent
the
current academic-critical consensus. The one by Elliott
Antokoletz opens
with a
boldly formulated assertion of long-established truths:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
An unprecedented departure from established musical
traditions
characterizes much
of the music composed during the first decade of the
twentieth century . .
. . No
changes of musical style or technique have ever produced
such a sense of
historical discontinuity as those that gave rise to our own
era. This
condition
may be traced directly to the radical change in the basic
premises of the
musical
language itself, a revolutionary transformation stemming
most prominently
from
the works of Ives, Scriabin, Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky,
and members of
the
Vienna Schoenberg circle.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This is a venerable saga, handed down from bard to bard for
many a year,
but by
now we all know it isn't true. The music of the first
decades of the
present
century, encompassing the outputs of all the res named
in the
concluding
honor roll, is far 

<B></B>

 more appropriately
viewed as a maximalizing phase
within the
traditions established over the course of the preceding
century than as a
departure from them. (To add to the topsy-turviness of the
standard
account, when
the real breaks came, in the 1920s, it was necessary to
disguise them,
then and
since, as a recovery of historical continuity.)
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Thanks to the
recent work of many scholars, in what amounts to a
burgeoning
historiographical
and analytical revolution, this is now very easy to see.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
It
takes
far more intellectual effort, in fact, to go on maintaining
the existence
of (or
perhaps more to the point, simply to go on maintaining) the
wall between
the
modernist Mighty Handful and their antecedents. Yet, as
contemporary
scholarly
performance still attests, many think the effort worthwhile.
Partly, no
doubt, it
is to keep up the status of the modernist giants as giants.
Praising famous
men--or rather, praising self-made men--will remain on the
agenda until
those
perpetually rising middle classes quit rising. It won't be
anytime soon
(and I've
done my share and can't promise I'll stop).

<p>
But there is something else at work here, too. The myth of
the
revolutionary
transformation acts as another sort of <I>cordon
sanitaire</I> around the
thing
transformed--that is, as Antokoletz so resonantly puts it,
"the musical
language
itself." If rupture with the historical past is accepted as
a given--if,
for
example (as Van den Toorn insists in his subtitle), the
<I>Rite of Spring
</I>is
assumed to represent "the <I>beginning </I>of a musical
language" rather
than an
extension or a maximalization or a culmination--then study
of "the basic
premises" of modern music can proceed on an entirely
inferential basis,
and an
entirely sequestered one. The "autonomy" of the analytical
act is
protected. The
advantage of such an approach--the gain, as it
were--consists precisely in
what
is lost from it.

<p>
Stravinsky knew this first and best. As early as the 1920s
(the time, as I
say,
of the real "breaks"), Stravinsky was busily revising the
history of
<I>The Rite
</I>and erasing its past. It was in 1920 that he first told
an interviewer
that
the first inspiration for the ballet had been not a vision
of its final
dance (as
he had previously stated) but a musical theme, and that
consequently he had
written "une oeuvre architectonique et non anecdotique" (an
architectonic
and not
an anecdotal work).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Over the next fifty years he continually
reinforced the notion that <I>The Rite of Spring, </I>of all
things, was a
"purely musical" work. Perhaps influenced to some degree by
the triumph he
experienced in 1914 ("such as <I>composers </I>rarely
enjoy," he recalled
in old
age), when Pierre Monteux conducted the score in the Salle
Pleyel to a
reception
as tumultuous as the first had been, but now
enthusiastically positive, he
averred categorically that "I prefer <I>Le Sacre </I>as a
concert
piece."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Many have followed him in this preference. And even if
matters of
preference are
laid aside, it is undeniable that, as Van den Toorn points
out at the very
beginning of his study of the ballet, "for the greater part
of this
century our
knowledge and appreciation of <I>The Rite of Spring </I>have
come from the
concert hall and recordings" (<I>STRS, </I>1). For many, if
not for most
spectators, visual exposure to the work comes after years of
tremendous
stagings
before the mind's eye under the stimulus of the powerful
music, and is
often
disappointing. Van den Toorn goes on to aver, with
Stravinsky, 

<B></B>

 that these
facts
of life and history justify the relegation of all
impedimenta--"the
scenario
itself, the choreography, and, above all, the close
'interdisciplinary'
conditions of coordination under which the music is now
known to have been
composed"--to the limbic category of "the 'extra-musical.'"
"Like pieces
of a
scaffolding," he ingeniously observes, "they were abandoned
in favor of the
edifice itself" (<I>STRS,</I> 2).

<p>
And yet we note a familiar diction, betokening a familiar
discourse, in the
elemental opposition of the "extramusical" scaffold to "the
edifice
<I>itself,"
</I>and wonder how access to the latter is to be gained. The
answer, it
turns
out, is not surprising. We reach the edifice itself by
rigorously
excluding all
that does not conduce directly to "pure musical delight"
(<I>STRS,</I> 7).
And
what is that? Van den Toorn quotes the cold-war Stravinsky:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he composer works through a perceptual, not a onceptual
process. He
perceives,
he selects, he combines, and is not in the least aware at
what point
meanings of
a different sort and significance grow into his works. All
he knows or
cares
about is the apprehension of the contours of form, for form
is everything.
(<I>STRS, </I>18)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<I>Form is everything. </I>That seems about as definitive
and as extreme a
declaration of formalist principles as could be desired. And
yet Van den
Toorn
actually manages to exceed the latterday Stravinsky's
formalism in two
distinct
ways. The first is by explicitly identifying the listener's
viewpoint and
role
with those attributed by Stravinsky to the composer,
something Stravinsky
never
thought to do. "One need merely substitute listener for
composer in the
above
quotations," Van den Toorn observes, "and the reasoning
becomes
impregnable"
(<I>STRS,</I> 19). It is not reasoning that is impregnable
here, however,
but a
tautology. The second strategy, inadvertent though it may
have been, was
misquotation. The last sentence in the extract, as published
by Craft and
Stravinsky, reads as follows: "All he knows or cares about
is his
apprehension of
the contour of <I>the </I>form, for <I>the </I>form is
everything."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
As a Russian speaker, to be sure, Stravinsky must have
dropped his definite
articles in English every day. But what a difference they
make to the
sense here!
What Stravinsky evidently intended as a description of a
particular act
(composing) is transformed by Van den Toorn into a universal
aesthetic
stance.

<p>
It transpires, then, that Van den Toorn's hypothetical
listener is not
really
identified with this particular (or any particular)
composer. He inhabits a
hermetically sealed world of his own making, and he would
like to rest
there
undisturbed for the sake of the pleasure to be derived by
bonding, as it
were
intersubjectively, with the music he hears. In a later
article Van den
Toorn
makes this point yet more explicit:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he source of the attraction, the source of our conscious
intellectual
concerns, is the passionate nature of the relationship that
is struck. But
this
relationship is given immediately in experience and is not
open to the
inquiry
that it inspires. Moments of aesthetic rapport, of
self-forgetting
at-oneness
with music, are immediate. The mind, losing itself in
contemplation,
becomes
immersed in the musical object, becomes one with that
object.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I>The
music itself, </I>then, is really <I>the music myself.
</I>"Leave me alone
with
me," is Van den Toorn's ultimate plea to historians and
students of
culture, and
he speaks for a broad cohort. It is a perfectly reasonable
request, coming
from a
listener. Is it reasonable when it comes from a scholar? Or
do scholars
have
other responsibilities, public ones?

<p>
The formalist strategy just examined--that of authorizing
the
preoccupation with
"music itself" by identifying the listener's concerns with
those of the
composer--lies behind the analytical commonplace that to
understand (or,
more
precisely, to comprehend) something is to give an account of
its making. A
prominent music analyst was recently provoked by a hostile
reviewer into
formulating this perception as a maxim (albeit in the form
of a question):
"How
can anyone know <I>what </I>something is--i.e., be in a
position to make
aesthetic judgments about it--without knowing <I>how </I>it
is
made?"
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
To say this, of course, is to contradict a fundamental
precept of Arnold Schoenberg, one of the founders, as a
theorist, of the
modern
practice of musical analysis, and one of the primary
objects, as a
composer, of
the analytical practices here upheld. In a letter to his
brother-in-law,
the
violinist Rudolf Kolisch, who had worked out an exemplary
formalistic
analysis of
Schoenberg's Third Quartet, the composer wrote, "I can't
utter too many
warnings
against overrating these analyses, since after all they only
lead to what
I have
always been dead set against: seeing how it is <I>done;
</I>whereas I have
always
helped people to see: what it <I>is!" </I>And he admonished
Kolisch in
particular
that an accounting of the manufacture of music "is not where
the aesthetic
qualities reveal themselves."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
But then, Schoenberg did not at the time possess the notion
of "the music
itself," and, unlike Stravinsky, he did not live long enough
to pick it up.
Returning to a recent writer like Antokoletz and his
discussion of <I>The
Rite of
Spring, </I>we will not be surprised to find its purview,
like Van den
Toorn's,
resolutely purged of the "extramusical." The subject and
scenario have been
boiled down to the single remark that the ballet is "highly
ritualistic";
but
even that little trace is immediately turned into a
characterization of
"the
music itself": "In this highly ritualistic ballet, we find
the most
thorough-going use of narrow-range melodies, based on
nonfunctional
diatonic
modality, and constant repetition of short rhythmic motives
or phrases in
the
typically irregular meters of Russian folk music"
(<I>TCM1,</I> 94). For
the
rest, the description of <I>The Rite </I>is a description of
manufacture,
covering not only the "generation" of the individual work,
but of the way
in
which "Stravinsky transforms and expands the Russian
folk-music properties
into
an abstract set of pitch relations to form his own personal
contemporary
musical
language" (<I>TCM1, </I>96). Both curious and typical is the
identification of
Stravinsky's putative practical methods of construction with
theoretical
generalizations made many years after the fact by George
Perle ("interval
cycles") and Pieter van den Toorn ("octatonicism"). Method
is inferred from
"structure" and then attributed to the composer, whose work
is thus
rationalized
and rendered abstract.

And harmless. What is chiefly objectionable about such
analysis is not its
anachronism or its purloining of the composer's authority.
What is chiefly
objectionable 

<B></B>

 is its propensity to
normalize and, in yet another way, to
sanitize. To detect regularities and familiar patterns
beneath a
complicated or
unusual surface (for all that it contradicts the myth of
disruption) is
evidence
of analytical acumen; and so regularity of pattern is prized
and sought,
and
inevitably found. Consider Antokoletz's parsing of the
opening bassoon
solo in
<I>The Rite </I>in such a way as to demonstrate its
"structural balance"
and its
character as a "'closed off'" formal scheme (<I>TCM1,</I>
95-96; <a href=2.1taruskin_1.html> 1</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Stravinsky's adaptation of a Lithuanian folk melody is
cut up
into four segments, of which the first and last are held to
be a rhythmic
palindrome (1+4:5+1), and the middle pair are held to be a
hemiola
(2x3:3x2). By
separating the sixth note (A with fermata) from the
sixteenth-note group,
Antokoletz's segmentation contradicts Stravinsky's phrasing,
ignores the
obvious
melodic parallelism, and occludes the very cadential
structure the
segmentation
is supposed to be revealing. As to the middle pair, hemiolas
are only
hemiolas
when they take up the same amount of (notated) time. And
besides, the
separation
of the two segments is entirely an artifact of the
bar-placement, a
notational
convenience that both the phrasing and the explicitly
demanded "tempo
rubato"
conceal from the ear. Antokoletz has parsed the music as it
looks, not as
it
sounds. The whole analysis is a fiction designed to produce
a specious,
sanitary
("classical"?) regularity.

<p>
Tendentious segmentation is in fact a standard feature of
analysis that
purports
to reveal "the music itself."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
What is revealed instead is a
germ-free vivarium, entirely "closed off," as Antokoletz
says, from the
world in
which the music was composed 

<B></B>

 and in
which it is experienced (<I>TCM1,</I>
95-96).
This utopian harmony seems maladapted, to say the least, to
Antokoletz's
general
view of twentieth-century music as a "revolutionary
transformation," an
"unprecedented departure" and a product of "historical
discontinuity," all
of
which, at first blush, connotes violence. But on reflection
it is all the
more
apparent that a reading of twentieth-century music as
"closed off" from
the past
is precisely what is necessary to clear space for such
utopian visions of
rational order as modern analysts propose. Yet reading such
analyses with
even
minimal historical awareness is discomfiting. One can only
wonder why such
well-behaved music should have evoked protests at its first
performance.

<p>
Robert Morgan's analysis of <I>The Rite, </I>in his
similarly titled
textbook, is
similarly normalizing and sanitizing. He describes the
famous ostinato
chord from
the "Augurs of Spring" as being only superficially what it
appears to be,
namely,
"a combination of two triadic structures, a dominant seventh
chord built on
E-flat and a major triad on F-flat." Such a description
(which Stravinsky,
it
should be noted, never outgrew) attempts an accomodation
with the
perceptual, if
not the conceptual, norms of an earlier practice, and
therefore violates
the
cardinal precept of the modernist myth. Rather, Morgan says,
the chord is
"an
integrated sonority with octatonic qualities" because it is
"largely,
though not
exclusively, drawn from the scale Eb-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C-Db-Eb"
(<I>TCM2,</I>
97).

<p>
Morgan's two descriptive comments are in contradiction: one
posits
integration,
the other ("largely, though not exclusively, drawn . . .")
posits
eclecticism,
but an eclecticism that is never acknowledged or accounted
for, since
Morgan
never says where the part of the chord comes from that is
not drawn from
the
octatonic scale he adduces. The discrepancy between the
object and its
description is swept under the rug.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The function of the
"Augurs"
chord, as Morgan describes it, is likewise normative and
reassuring: "the
chord
provides a basic pitch reference, or tonal focus, for the
entire section:
twice
interrupted by contrasting segments, it returns in unaltered
form," while
"even
the interruptions reveal the influence of this chord"
(<I>TCM2, </I>97).
So again
one wants to ask, Why the great Paris scandal? Why did
things get as far as
ting?

<p>
Morgan does try to account for the initial reaction by
admitting "the
harshness
of <I>The Rite," </I>owing to its "high level of dissonance
and
chromaticism"
(<I>TCM2, </I>97). He many have been responding to Arnold
Whittall's very
salutary reminder, in an article entitled "Music Analysis as
Human
Science?"
that, whatever the analytical premises from which it is
approached, "what
is most
significant" in <I>The Rite </I>"is the existence and
dominance of
discords."
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
This does need saying nowadays, and it does evoke
the
early reception of the work: after the first Russian
performance (under
Koussevitzky in Moscow in February 1914), the critic
Vyacheslav
Karat&iuml;gin
wrote in amazement that "from beginning to end there is not
a single pure
triad."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Whittall goes on to propose that "as a portrait of
human
savagery, the tragic power of <I>Le Sacre </I>may depend
precisely on the
freedom
for conflict to be expressed by the most immediate and
effective means."
This
sounds like a plea to restore the "extra-musical" dimension
that Van den
Toorn
and the others so zealously exclude. And yet even 

<B></B>

 Whittall does not
envision an
analytical practice that goes beyond "the music itself."
It's the nature
of the
beast to exclude the world, he finally agrees, in what seems
to me a very
pessimistic conclusion. "It may indeed be the case," he
concedes

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that the "rules" of the game can only be discovered if the
discords are
"translated" into some other medium, in which they can be
examined without
the
psychological burden of their true character and quality.
For <I>Le Sacre
</I>remains an explosive work, and analysis may be
impossible unless the
score is
first defused.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Yet the myth of <I>The Rite </I>demands reinstatement of its
explosiveness, and
analysts are thus in a quandary. One way out is to imagine
<I>The Rite
</I>in a
dual aspect: as being one thing historically, quite another
thing
"essentially."
Those committed to maintaining the high disciplinary walls
that now
separate
"musicology" from "music theory" seem to have no trouble
with such a
divided
consciousness. The division, furthering methodological
purity, is seen as a
necessary ablution, a cleansing-of-the-hands that must
precede the delicate
operation by which "the music itself" is isolated and
dissected. The
sterility of
the theoretical discipline is itself seen as evidence of its
superior
condition.
Thus, asks V. Kofi Agawu, summarizing the case for
institutional isolation,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Has not the most influential historical work always needed
theory, whereas
the
best theoretical work rarely depended on the insights of
conventional
history? On
present showing, we might say that theory is theory and
history is
history, and
that although they may meet or clash sometimes, they remain
separate
disciplines.
To this writer at least, that ain't such a bad thing.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
I have no problem with Agawu's notion of a music history in
need of
theory. One
cannot visit the bathroom without theory. In my own
scholarly work, for
all that
I am classified, at least by Agawu, as a "historian," I
certainly have had
need
of theory, have freely helped myself to it, and even
contributed to it. As
for
theory in no need of history--well, that's his problem. But
the divided
consciousness Agawu asserts as healthy is what provides
writers like
Morgan with
a way out of the quandary to which I have referred. Morgan
prefaces his
normalizing, sanitizing account of <I>The Rite </I>as a
score with a
paragraph
devoted to <I>The Rite </I>as an event, in which a familiar
fable is
related:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If the Paris productions of <I>The Firebird </I>and
<I>Petrushka
</I>established
Stravinsky as a major composer of international reputation,
the score for
his
third Diaghilev ballet, <I>The Rite of Spring, </I>made him
the most widely
recognized composer of his age. The premi&egrave;re of
<I>The Rite </I>in
Paris
on May 29, 1913, is probably the most famous (or notorious)
premi&egrave;re in
the history of music. The ballet's scenic evocation of pagan
Russian
rituals
elicited from Stravinsky a score of unprecedented primitive
force, in
which music
seemed to be distilled to its rhythmic essence, hammered out
by the
orchestra
with unrestrained percussive intensity. Shaken by the
radical nature of
both
score and ballet, the opening-night audience was in an
uproar from the
beginning,
with those both for and against shouting at one another in
heated debate.
The
noise level was so high that most of the music remained
inaudible; yet if
nothing
else, the sensational aspect of the event placed Stravinsky
at the
forefront of
the musical revolutions of the time. For contemporary
listeners of <I>The
Rite,
</I>as for those of the first atonal works of Schoenberg,
music could
never be
the same again. (<I>TCM1,</I> 95-96)

<p>
Not a bad achievement for inaudible music. But again, as
always, the myth
accommodates contradictions. That is what myths are for. The
reality was
different. As the ballet historians Joan Acocella, Lynn
Garafola, and
Jonnie
Greene have put it, "the original <I>Rite of Spring </I>was
no sooner made
than
it was laid aside." With a sophistication that knows no peer
in the musical
literature on the work, they go on to observe that
"therefore while in the
historical record we call it a ballet, the way we actually
know it is as a
collection of ideas: ideas leading up to its creation,
together with ideas
leading away from the circumstances of its production."
These remarks come
at the
outset of a remarkable essay entitled <I>"The Rite of Spring
</I>Considered as a
Nineteenth-Century Ballet," in which the authors do what in
the
musicological
literature seems to be unthinkable: they insert the work
into a context
defined
by the past, not the future.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
They perceive no break with
tradition,
but manifold extensions of it. They go so far, in fact, as
to interpret the
reception history of <I>The Rite </I>as "a history of the
twentieth
century's
coping with its inheritance from the nineteenth"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 71). This
is
fabulously succinct and discerning, and provides the best
possible context
for
considering the sanitizing efforts I have been describing.

<p>
What did that nineteenth-century legacy consist of? First of
all, of
course, it
comprised primitivism, the belief that the qualities of
primitive or
chronologically early cultures are superior to those of
contemporary
civilization, or as the ballet historians put it, that "it
is those things
that
are least socialized, least civilized--children, peasants,
'savages,' raw
emotion, plain speech--that are closest to truth"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68).
Primitivism
is often touted, especially in discussions of <I>The Rite of
Spring,
</I>as one
of those twentieth-century revolutions that cut our age off
from the past,
but it
has a very long history indeed. (As the ballet historians
shrewdly note,
"it is
one of the chief teachings of the New Testament"
["<I>TRS,</I>" 68].) It
was a
core constituent of Romanticism, against which the modern
(and again,
especially
<I>The Rite</I>) is so often and so wrongly construed as a
break. The idea
of
primitive immediacy of consciousness, of at-oneness with the
world, was at
the
very heart of the German romantic concept of
culture--<I>Kultur</I>--as
opposed
to the false <I>Zivilisation </I>of the Enlightenment (that
is, of
France), and
became the most basic component of the Germans' construction
of their
national
identity.
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
At the other end of the nineteenth century, the
end that
provided <I>The Rite </I>with its immediate background, the
idea surfaced
with
particular force in Russia, where in a curious semantic
switch, the
cognate word,
<I>kul'tura, </I>was associated with Enlightenment, and a
good ur-Slavic
synonym,
<I>stikhiya, </I>was pressed into service in the name of
primitive romantic
immediacy.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
All of this was brought to a head by the same
sense of
impending catastrophe that seized political and social
thinkers in the
aftermath
of the Emancipation with its great uprooting of the
peasantry, and horror
at "the
mockery that urban poverty made of the promises of the
Industrial
Revolution"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68). "In our hearts," wrote the poet
Alexander Blok in
1908, "the
needle of a seismograph has twitched."
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
It was in the name of
a
maximalized primitivism that nineteenth-century romanticism
gave way to
twentieth-century revolutionary politics. 

<B></B>

<p>
Maximalized and desentimentalized primitivism leads to that
bleak vision
known as
biologism, "the belief that life is fundamentally its
physical facts:
birth,
death, survival" ("<I>TRS,</I>" 68) and that anything else
is mere
ornament and
palliative, a lie. Many were those who immediately saw this
in <I>The Rite
</I>and were afraid. Jacques Rivi&egrave;re, the editor of
the <I>Nouvelle
revue
fran&ccedil;aise, </I>who wrote the most prescient of all
review of the
ballet,
concluded the review with the flat statement that beneath
its
"sociological"
exterior "there is something even more momentous, there is a
second
meaning, more
secret, more frightful: <I>ce ballet est un ballet
biologique" </I>(this
ballet
is a biological ballet). And, he continued,

the
nineteenth-century science of anthropology to demystify

demote
myths from the status to which occultists like the

myths represented "a record of contact between mortals and

sanctity of
revealed
religion as well. As Leon Surette observes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Frazer's findings reduced the putatively unique event of
Christ's passion,
death,
and resurrection to just one of hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of such
deaths and
resurrections that have been enacted around the world from
the earliest
times.
Frazer's revelation that the solemn Christian mass is a
survival of bloodly
ritual murder and ritual cannibalism--even though he was
careful to avoid
explicitly drawing this obvious conclusion--can clearly
count as the
revelation
of a secret history.

<p>
And there it was, no longer secret, on the stage of the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des
Champs-Elys&eacute;es. As Acocella, Garafola and Greene
observe about the
Chosen
Maiden, "had 

<B></B>

 the community simply sat
down and eaten her, this would have
made a
difference of tone, but not, arguably, of meaning"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68). In
that
case they would have been celebrating the Eucharist.

<p>
Now before proceeding any further, the obvious objection
must be
addressed, that
everything that the trio of ballet historians and I have
been discussing
belongs
to the "extramusical" layer of <I>The Rite, </I>the
"scaffolding," as
Pieter van
den Toorn says, that has been rightly discarded over time in
favor of the
music,
"the edifice itself." But Stravinsky's contribution is not
so easily
separable
from the rest. And the metaphor of the edifice is all wrong
because it
suggests
permanence, while Stravinsky's music has undergone
change--the first and
most
decisive change being precisely its detachment from its
original context.

<p>
When Acocella, Garafola and Greene say that the "original"
<I>Rite </I>was
"laid
aside," we can assume that they mean Nijinsky's <I>Rite,
</I>not
Stravinsky's.
The original choreography was not only laid aside but
forgotten.
Deliberately
suppressed by Diaghilev following Nijinsky's departure from
his company,
and
replaced in 1920 by Massine's, it was only painstakingly and
(necessarily)
fairly
speculatively reconstructed by Millicent Hodson in the 1980s
for
performances
beginning in 1987 by the Joffrey Ballet.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
After a hiatus of
three-quarters of a century, the Nijinsky choreography
possessed little
more than
an archeological or (early-modernist) period interest for
most observers,
and was
found inadequate by many dance critics.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Nijinsky's
contribution, it
is clear, has played a negligible role in the ballet's
history.

<p>
What binds all productions together, of course, is the
uniform presence of
the
score, which thus seems all the more compellingly to assume
the standing of
essential "edifice," to which everything else, including the
transitory
plastic
and visual embodiments, remains parasitic and, ultimately,
excrescent (the
"scaffolding").

<p>
And yet that score, too, was at first "laid aside." The
handful of
performances
it received in May and June of 1913 by the Ballets Russes in
Paris and
London was
followed by the two Russian concert premieres (Moscow and
St. Petersburg)
under
Koussevitzky the next February, and, finally, Monteux's
triumphant
performance at
the Salle Pleyel in the spring.

<p>
And that, for a long time, was it. It took a long while for
the score to
achieve
the awesome reputation we now assume it possessed from the
beginning. In
1913 it
was not the primary object of attention. The most cursory
perusal of the
Paris
reviews of the original production, conveniently collected
in Truman C.
Bullard's
dissertation, reveals that it was the now-forgotten Nijinsky
choreography,
far
more than Stravinsky's music, that fomented the famous
"riot" at the
premiere.
Many if not most reviews fail to deal with Stravinsky's
contribution at all
beyond naming him as composer. And, as most memoirs of the
premiere (and
even
Morgan's account of it) agree, a lot of the music went
unheard, which did
not
dissuade the protesters in the least. In the words of one
reviewer, "at
the end
of the Prelude the crowd simply stopped listening to the
music so that
they might
better amuse themselves with the choreography."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
And the crowd
managed to turn Stravinsky against Nijinsky, giving him his
first reason
for
wanting to cleanse his score of "extramusical" taint.

<B></B>

<p>
The score was not published until 1921--that is, not until
Nijinsky's
contribution had been scratched and Stravinsky had begun, in
tendentious
interviews, the process of purifying the music. Only then
did the score's
victorious career begin in any real sense. The composer's
squeamishness was
conditioned in part, no doubt, by the initial "failure" of
the work as a
ballet,
a failure the composer felt alongside the choreographer all
through the war
years, his so-called "Swiss" period. Throughout that time,
for all that it
was
instantly his most notorious work, thoughts of <I>The Rite
</I>were tinged
for
Stravinsky with thoughts of defeat. Briefly despondent in
the fall of
1913, he
unburdened himself in a remarkably--indeed, practically
uniquely--self-revealing
letter to Alexandre Benois, a letter that betrays not only
the extent of
Stravinsky's emotional dependence on Diaghilev, but also the
extent of his
fear
about his own creative future in the wake of the <I>Rite
</I>fiasco:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Ah, my dear, this last offspring of mine even now gives me
not a moment's
peace.
What an incredible storm of teeth-gnashing rage about it!
Seryozha
[Diaghilev]
gives me horrible news about how people who were full of
enthusiasm or
unwavering
sympathy for my earlier works have turned against this one.
So what, say
I, or
rather think I --that's how it ought to be. But what has
made Seryozha
himself
seem to waver about<I> Le Sacre?</I>--a work he never
listened to at
rehearsals
without exclaiming, "Divine!" . . . To tell the truth,
reviewing my
impressions
of his attitude toward <I>Le Sacre, </I>I am coming to the
conclusion that
he
will not encourage me in this direction. This means I am
deprived of my
single
and truest support in the matter o propagandizing my
artistic ideas. You
will
agree that this completely knocks me off my feet, for I
cannot, you
understand, I
simply <I>cannot </I>write what they want from me--that is,
repeat
myself--repeat
anyone else you like, only not yourself!--for that is how
people write
themselves
out. But enough about <I>Le Sacre. </I>It makes me
miserable.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Here
we get an inkling of what it was that caused Stravinsky to
take refuge
from the
"extramusical" in "the music itself"--a creative swerve that
colored all
the rest
of his career. His reasons need not be our reasons. And yet
we seem to
have our
own reasons for laying the "original" <I>Rite </I>aside and
purging its
music. We
want to forget the ways in which Stravinsky's music
participated in the
great
stripdown from <I>kul'tura </I>to <I>stikhiya, </I>from
humanism to
biologism--ways that have always been salient and that used
to be
acknowledged,
but that the music-analytical enterprise has striven hard to
hush up. In
the
absence of a perceived threat, denial would have been
superfluous.

<p>
As has been observed in connection with Scriabin's late
music, the
attenuation of
functional harmonic relationships entailed a knowing loss in
the power of
music
to represent desire, hence subjectivity.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Both Scriabin and
Stravinsky were happy to give up what the symbolist poet
Vyacheslav Ivanov
called
the <I>"maliy 'ya,'" </I>the "petty 'I,'"
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
in the interests
of, in
the one case, the transcendent dissolution of the ego and,
in the other,
the
absorption of the individual consciousness in the
collective. As
Rivi&egrave;re
noted with his customary percipience, the nonprogressive
harmony and the
relentless foregrounding of the <I>corps de ballet </I>went
together in the
representation of "l'homme au temps o&ugrave; il n'existait
pas encore
comme
individu," mankind without individuals.

<p>
Where Scriabin represented the eschatological collapse of
time and space
in a
music that was highly mobile in its darting root movements
within an
inversionally and transpositionally invariant harmonic
matrix,
Stravinsky's music
in <I>The Rite </I>was of a kind that prompted critic after
critic in
Russia to
resort to the word <I>nepodvizhnost'</I>--immobility--to
describe its
character
and affect. The long stretches of arrested root motion and
pulsing rhythm
that
analysts of "the music itself" now prefer to rationalize as
structurally
unifying--that is, reassuringly fulfilling a traditional
formal
mandate--were
originally heard (and are still easily heard) as the
annihilation of the
subject
and the denial of psychology.

<p>
Along with this immobility went a calculated formal disunity
and
disjunction--<I>drobnost' </I>in Russian, meaning the
quality of being a
sum-of-parts. Study of Stravinsky's sketchbook shows just
how deliberate
this
calculation was. Motivic or even full-blown thematic
relations that were
salient
in early sketches were ruthlessly attenuated as the music
was
"refined."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
The "art of transition" between sections is
famously
eschewed in favor of abrupt, lurching shifts, often coming,
as Elliott
Carter
once observed, "at a point where the statement of an idea is
incomplete,"
or even
of a section.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The very ending of the first tableau is
similarly
unprepared, coming as a shocking halt rather than a
conclusion. There is
little
recall of the past in this music, and little forecasting of
the future; in
any
case, there is far less than is customary in concert music,
which is the
category, in the opinion of Stravinsky and the analysts, to
which we are
now
supposed to assign <I>The Rite.</I>

<p>
The absence of recall and forecast is an absence of
memory--precisely what
Rivi&egrave;re described in characterizing the subhuman
corpus (and what
Nietzsche, in a famous essay, defined as the crucial
lack--or
freedom--that sets
the animal kingdom apart from mankind).
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Carter sensed this
characteristic in Stravinsky's music, too. It was a
perception that began
with
the repetitive folk-tale plots of <I>Renard </I>and
<I>Histoire du soldat,
</I>both adapted from the collection of the
nineteenth-century ethnographer
Alexander Afanasyev.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In these two stories, the characters on stage and the
audience are dealt
with as
if they had no memory, as if living always in the present
and not learning
from
previous events--a dramatic situation that suggests the
puppet world, like
that
of Punch and Judy, as the authors certainly intended, and
also in a larger
sense
inescapable fate and universality of action such as that in
the Everyman
plays or
that of the shades in the Hades of Gide's libretto for
<I>Pers&eacute;phone
</I>who ceaselessly repeat the gesture of living.

<!--_extract-->
&#009;Whatever the intention, this kind of almost disjointed
repetition
immeasurably increases the pathos of both works. In fact, I
came to
believe, as I
studied the soldier's part [for a performance under Lukas
Foss], that it
was just
because of this curious plot repetition, especially as it is
coupled with
music,
that, although almost continually different in tiny ways, is
always drawing
attention to its repetitive form.

<p>
In
<I>The Rite,
</I>unlike
<I>Histoire du soldat </I>with its very reflective title
character, the
elimination of memory does not increase the sense of pathos.
Rather, it
makes
pathos impossible. And that may be why even Carter resisted
the
<I>drobnost'
</I>of <I>The Rite, </I>preferring to view its harmonic
ostinatos as
"structures"
that "characterize and unify each dance," and even
speculating, as he
suggested
to Stravinsky (who declined to respond), that "all the
chords in the Sacre
were
related to one source chord," which he thought he had
discovered in the
introduction (where such a thing belonged).

<p>
Indeed, the global unifier in <I>The Rite </I>has been an
analytical
unicorn or
philosopher's stone, avidly hunted, found, asserted. Always,
it turns out,
some
transient recurrent feature has been seized upon and
exaggerated to the
status of
"universality," as when Robert Moevs asserted that the whole
ballet is in
the key
of D minor,
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
or when Messain/Boulez reduce it all to a rhythmic
cell.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
I, too, have been susceptible to this
need,
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
and, I'm sure, one of the reasons why Allen Forte chose
<I>The Rite
</I>for his
first full-dress demonstration of his highly abstract
"set-theoretic"
technique
of harmonic analysis is because through its use he was able
to propose
solutions
to the famous enigma. The search for the global unifier, I
am convinced,
is not
motivated only by analytical preconceptions or by the wish
to give <I>The
Rite
</I>the academic respectability that is obviously its due.
Nor is it only
or
mainly the prestige that comes to any successful solver of
standing
problems that
motivates that constant search. It is a case of resistance
to a threat
that goes
far beyond the disciplinary limits of musicology.

<p>
That threat is hinted at in the third Russian word that was
often applied
to
<I>The Rite </I>when it was new: <I>uproshcheniye,
</I>simplification.
<I>The
Rite, </I>for all its novelty and its inscrutability and the
dazzling
virtuosity
of its orchestral presentation, is not a complex score.
Elaborate
analytical
procedures can make it look far more complicated than it is,
even if that
complexity is only there to be whittled down in turn to an
orderly
structural
scheme.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
Why is this felt to be desirable? Because a rational
complexity is far less disturbing than a mystifying
simplicity.
Stravinsky's
radical simplification of texture, his static, vamping
harmonies, and his
repetitive, ostinato-driven forms, were the perfect musical
approach to the
primitivist ideal--the resolute shedding of conventional
complexities of
linear
thought and their replacement by long spans of unchanging
content,
accessible to
instant, as it were gnostic, apprehension and eliciting a
primitive,
kinesthetic
response.

<p>
Was this stripdown truly an <I>uproshchiniye, </I>a "second"
simplicity, a
synthesis vouchsafing a higher integration of thought and
feeling? Or was
it
merely what the Russians call an <I>oproshcheniye, </I>a
dehumanizing
retreat
from intellectual engagement and an impoverishment of
culture? That is a
question
that has never really gone away. It gave rise to a
controversy that
continued to
swirl about Stravinsky almost to the end of his career,
until
preoccupation with
"the music itself" and with the technology of its
production, a
preoccupation
Stravinsky did everything in his power to abet, managed to
marginalize it
at
last.

<p>
The view of Stravinsky as an apostle of <I>oproshcheniye,
</I>of course,
is the
view associated with Adorno, for whom Stravinsky's
simplified forms and
ego-annihilating ostinatos 

<B></B>

 spelled
"permanent regression." Adorno,
unfairly as it
may seem, seized upon an early Berlin review of <I>Renard
</I>that
interpreted
Stravinsky's primitivism (or "infantilism," as he preferred
to call it) as
"an
affirmative ideology," and noted that such an interpretation
"later
appeared in
Germany in a sinister context."
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Yet how unfair is it, really,
inasmuch as we know now, far better than Adorno could have
known it, that
when
that sinister affirmative surfaced in Germany, Stravinsky
was highly
susceptible
to its allure?
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Ultimately we have to ask what kind of a drama
<I>The
Rite </I>embodies--that is, to what category shall it be
assigned? We have
seen
that Arnold Whittall associated its shocking musical
qualities with "tragic
power" and the expression of "conflict." But is that not a
sentimental
reading,
one that identifies with the Chosen One in a manner
supported neither by
the
scenario nor by the score? Was not the dance critic Andrey
Levinson closer
to the
mark when he called <I>The Rite </I>"an icy comedy of
primeval
hysteria"?
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
And was not Jacques Rivi&egrave;re correct when he
called special attention to the absence of conflict, even at
the
denoument? The
Chosen One, he exclaimed, betrays no "personal terror" at
all, even though
we
developed humans in our humanism cannot help assuming that
such terror
"must fill
her soul." On the contrary,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
She carries out a rite; she is absorbed into a social role,
and without
giving
any indication of comprehension or interpretation, she acts
according to
the will
and under the impact of a being more vast than she, of a
monster full of
ignorance and appetite, of cruelty and darkness . . . .
Mankind is
dominated by
something more inert than itself, more opaque, more
constraining--namely,
society
with its fellows.
<sup><a NAME="REF66"
HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
It is with that opaque, constraining force
that
Stravinsky's crashing orchestra, in the "Danse sacrale," is
clearly
identified,
and in its terrible dynamism it persuades us--nay, coerces
us--to share
its point
of view. Rarely has an antihumanist message been so
irresistibly
communicated.

<p>
 Even the ballet historians seem to offer a sentimental
reading of <I>The
Rite
</I>when they write that "the girl is forthrightly sent to
her death in
order to
benefit the community," and add that "the situation could
hardly be more
horrible" ("<I>TRS,</I>" 69). On the contrary, the
sacrificial dance is
presented
as anything but horrible--and that's what's horrible. The
ballet presents
and
celebrates an absolute absence of compassion as the
necessary correlate of
the
absence of "psychology," of human subjectivity. The Chosen
One, after all,
is one
of those beings initially presented in the first tableau as
an
<I>Adolescente,
</I>described by the composer (in a text he repeatedly
attempted to
disavow in
his interwar and cold-war phases) as being "not fully
formed: their sex is
unique
and double, like a tree."
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
This hermaphroditism is at the
opposite
evolutionary extreme from the androgyne, that perfected
being toward which
the
art of Scriabin (and the early Schoenberg) aspired. It is
the mark of an
unformed, insensate and expendable creature, and the
ballet's music, no
less than
its "extramusical" components, mark her for pitiless
forfeiture.

<p>
Now these are among the troubling aspects of <I>The Rite
</I>that the
discourse
of "the music itself" evades. That discourse is by no means
confined to
academic
analysis. It 

<B></B>

 dominates public criticism
of classical music as well, and the
evasion, when challenged, can turn quite explicit, as when
Samual Lipman of
<I>The New Criterion, </I>responding to <I>New York Times
</I>pieces about
Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky, denounces my "attempt to write
about music by
writing
about something else very much not music."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
One senses the
same sort
of evasion in recent performances of <I>The Rite</I>--one
might even say,
in its
contemporary performance practice--where emphasis is placed
on fleet
precision
and on an athletic virtuosity that defies or ignore the
crushing strain
the music
was meant to evoke, and which it achieved far more
dependably when it
actually
strained the capabilities of its performers.
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The work becomes
all
the more troubling when one reflects, as Adorno did, on
other
manifestations of
that special congeries of ideas that <I>The Rite
</I>embodies. The
discussion by
Acocella, Garafola, and Greene, following that of
Rivi&egrave;re,
emphasized the
darker aspects of primitivism--biologism, sacrifice of the
individual to
the
community, absence of compassion, submission to compulsion,
all within a
context
defined by Russian or Slavic national folklore. Now here is
a list drawn
up by a
prominent contemporary social philosopher in an attempt to
detail the
"coherent
cluster of values and ideas" that, he maintains, governed
the policies of
the
Nazi regime: "nationalism, biologism, communalism,
hierarchy, corporatism,
acceptance of authority, territoriality, aggression,
rejection of
compassion." I
hope it is evident that these hair-raising correspondences
are not adduced
in
order to establish guilt by association. As Professor
Gellner put it of
his list,
"this cluster did not simply spring out of the head of
Hitler [or, I'll
add, of
Stravinsky]; it has its roots in European history and ideas,
and deserves
investigation."
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
That is precisely what I would like to
maintain
about <I>The Rite of Spring.</I>

<p>
Rigorous musical analysis of a professional caliber must
have a place of
honor in
any such investigation, for the music plays the primary role
in carrying
to our
minds and hearts whatever cluster of values and ideas <I>The
Rite </I>or
any
other Stravinsky composition may embody. Can such an
analysis be
accomplished
without "defusing" the work, as Arnold Whittall suggests it
must? I hope
that as
the boundaries between "history" and "theory," between
historiography and
criticism, and between "the extramusical" and "the music
itself" continue
to
soften, and eventually dissolve, we will find it less
difficult to believe
that
it can.

[T]he question of an engaging context is an aesthetic as
well as an
historical
and analytic-theoretical one. And once a body of works
begins to assert
itself
along these lines, once individual works take hold on an
immediate basis
so that,
to an increasing extent, they prevail for what they are in
and of
themselves, not
for what they represent, then context itself, as a
reflection of this
transcendence, becomes less dependent on matters of
historical placement.
A great
variety of contexts can suggest themselves, as attention is
focused on the
works
themselves, on the nature of both their immediacy and the
relationship
that is
struck with the contemporary listener.

Wagner coined the term in an 1846 commentary to Beethoven's
Ninth
Symphony,
where he wrote that the instrumental recitative in the
fourth movement,
"already
almost breaking the bounds of absolute music, . . . stems
the tumult of
the other
instruments with its virile eloquence." The absoluteness of
absolute music
(or,
as Dahlhaus paraphrases it, "objectless instrumental music")
lies in its
"endless
and imprecise expressiveness," an idea Wagner locates in
Ludwig Tieck's
description of symphonic music: "insatiate desire forever
hieing forth and
turning back into itself." See Carl Dahlhaus, <I>The Idea of

Similarly, in the seminal article in which the octatonic
scale was
christened, Arthur Berger infers from a passage in <I>Les
Noces </I>the as
yet
unnamed "referential collection of eight pitch classes" that
"accounts for
it
all--with a few exceptions so marginal as scarcely to
require mention
(some dozen
tones, mainly ornamental)" ("Problems of Pitch Organization
in Stravinsky"
[1963]
in <I>Perspectives on Schoenberg and Stravinsky, </I>ed.
Benjamin Boretz
and
Edward T. Cone [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1968], 132). Since
nowhere
are criteria stated by which the structural and the
ornamental are
distinguished,
one must conclude that referability to the referential
collection is the
tacit
criterion, one that bends the argument, characteristically,
into a circle.
The
"ornamental" pitches, of course, have since proved
"structural" by
reference to
another analytical template (details in R. Taruskin,

Who can say whether "Le Sacre du Printemps" was in fact the
great modernist
masterpiece that it is now claimed to be? Perhaps it was
something more
like the
shaggy, dull, pseudo-folkloric thing that we saw in the
Joffrey Ballet
"reconstruction." Many of those who were disappointed by the
Joffrey
version
simply concluded that its flatness was due to its having
been put together
from
such scrappy evidence--in other words, that it wasn't really
Nijinsky. But

This observation applies in particular to the "Games" in the
first
tableau,
the "Game of Abduction" (<I>"Igra um&iuml;kaniya,"
</I>called the "Jeu du

in the published score) and the "Game of Cities" (<I>"Igra

included in the
scenario
in response to a single passage in the Kieven Primary
Chronicle--see R.

Scenario," in

Edmond
Strainchamps and Maria Rika Maniates (New York: Norton,
1984),
183-202--and were
originally sketched as a unit, with many thematic ideas in
common. Later
Stravinsky had no hesitation in detaching the "Game of
Abduction" from its
companion and inserting it in a much earlier position in the
score
(between the
"Augures printaniers" and the "Rondes printani&egrave;res").
Not only are
the
earlier thematic associations obscured, but the new
placement also
disrupts the
thematic links that had unified the pair of dances ("Les
Augures
Printaniers" and
"Rondes Printani&egrave;res") between which the "Game of
Abduction" now
intrudes
(full details forthcoming in R. Taruskin, <I>Stravinsky and

sixth chapter of <I>Poetics of Music, </I>referenced in note
17.
