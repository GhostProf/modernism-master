<h1 class="sec-headA">Plus de Jazz</h1>
<p>The idea of jazz modernism has two dimensions. The first is the acknowledgement that musicians such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Fats Waller deserve recognition for developing jazz into a modernist art music, comparable within its own genre to the innovations of modernists in other fields and media: "To call Armstrong, Waller, et al., 'modernists' is to appreciate their procedures as alchemists of the vernacular who have 'jazzed' the ordinary and given it new life."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The second, as I argue in this article, is the recognition that certain "jazz" principles and techniques are discernible in the works of other contemporary, modernist artists.</p>
<p>The story of jazz modernism is largely a history of migrations and detours, the movement of ideas and influences as well as of people, between the U.S. and Europe and back again, as well as across racial borderlines. The new jazz aesthetic represented by Ellington, Armstrong, and Waller, and the idea that jazz was becoming an art music in a way that had been quite unexpected early in the 1920s, was recognized and championed especially by European intellectuals and critics who were able to hear their music when they undertook tours of Europe in the first half of the 1930s. For example, when Louis Armstrong played in London in 1932, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span>'s show business columnist Hannen Swaffer reported ordinary people walking out, leaving "excited young men of the pseudo-intellectual kind … bleating and blahing in ecstasy."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1934, the English critic and composer <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Constant Lambert claimed that he knew of "nothing in Ravel so dextrous in treatment as the varied solos in the middle" of Ellington's 1928 "Hot and Bothered," nor anything in Stravinsky "more dynamic than the final section." At around the same time, the European-based Australian composer Percy Grainger placed Ellington alongside Bach and Delius in his pantheon of composers.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Such appraisals of jazz as art and jazz as modernism took some time to develop. At the start of the 1920s, the Bloomsbury art critic Clive Bell certainly believed that there was what he called a "Jazz theory of art," but he did not approve. In "Plus de Jazz" ("No More Jazz") he rails against the stupidity of its acolytes, "on whose banner is inscribed 'No discrimination!' 'No culture!' 'Not much thought!'"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The obituary now seems shockingly premature. Bell himself reckons that the jazz movement "bounced into the world somewhere about the year 1911," the year that Irving Berlin revived ragtime with the worldwide success of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 215). Bell was writing a decade later, in 1921, four years after the Original Dixieland Jazz Band made their raucous debut at London's Hammersmith Palais in 1917. Looking forward, this was still six years before Duke Ellington started his residency at the Cotton Club and seven years before Louis Armstrong recorded his genre-redefining "West End Blues." Timing apart, what is most surprising about Bell's attack on jazz is that, although originally written as a journal article, it appears as the final chapter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Since Cézanne</span> , the book in which he championed an emerging great tradition in modern art: the painting of "Derain, Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard, Friesz, Braque, etc." (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214). Why should Bell decide to end a defense of modern painting with an attack on the modern sounds of jazz—or, rather, with an attack on the modern <span style="font-style:italic;">phenomenon</span> of jazz, given that he offers no discussion or even description of jazz as music?<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>That silence is itself the clue. This is about culture wars, not music criticism. Bell's aim was to discriminate between good modernism and bad modernism; jazz represents the bad modernism that he deplored and to which his good painterly modernism would provide an antidote. If, for many Americans in the 1920s, "to argue about jazz was to argue about the nature of change itself," it was equally true for European intellectuals that to argue about the significance of jazz was to adopt a stance on modernity and the aesthetics of modernism.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>At bottom, Bell disliked jazz because it represented a "revolt against nobility and beauty." "The Jazz movement is a ripple on a wave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214), he asserts dismissively, a trivial symptom of modernization that had distracted attention away from the critical and valuable aspect of modernism, which was "the large movement which began at the end of the nineteenth century in a reaction against realism and scientific paganism" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214). The essence of jazz was its <span style="font-style:italic;">impudence</span>—"impudence which finds its technical equivalent in syncopation: impudence which rags"—and the preference for instant gratification over sustained aesthetic development or intellectual depth evident in its "determination to surprise" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 215). It pandered to "a typically modern craving for small profits and quick returns" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 216). Above all, jazz was liked by the wrong people, the young, the idle, and the unserious: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Jazz is very young: like short skirts, it suits thin, girlish legs, but it has a slightly humiliating effect on grey hairs. Its fears and dislikes—for instance, its horror of the noble and the beautiful—are childish; and so is its way of expressing them. Not by irony and sarcasm, but by jeers and grimaces does Jazz mark its antipathies. Irony and wit are for the grown-ups. Jazz dislikes them as much as it dislikes nobility and beauty. They are the products of the cultivated intellect, and Jazz cannot away with intellect or culture. Niggers can be admired artists without any gifts more singular than high spirits; so why drag in the intellect?</p></blockquote>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">La bonne compagnie</span> they [the inventors of Jazz] found in the lounges of great hotels, on transatlantic liners, in <span style="font-style:italic;">wagons-lits</span>, in music-halls, and in expensive motor-cars and restaurants. <span style="font-style:italic;">La bonne compagnie</span> was dancing one-steps to ragtime music. This, they said, was the thing. … And, of course, it was delightful for those who sat drinking their cocktails and listening to nigger-bands to be told that, besides being the jolliest people on earth, they were the most sensitive and gifted. They, along with the children and savages whom in so many ways they resembled, were the possessors of natural, uncorrupted taste. They first had appreciated ragtime and surrendered themselves to the compelling qualities of Jazz. Their instinct might be trusted: so, no more classical concerts and music-lessons; no more getting Lycidas by heart; no more Bædeker; no more cricking one's neck in the Sistine Chapel: unless the coloured gentleman who leads the band at the Savoy has a natural leaning towards these things you may depend upon it that they are noble, pompous, and fraudulent.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 216; 217–18)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>For Bell, it seems, snobbery and casually venomous racism are legitimate weapons in the defense of endangered cultural values: the "high seriousness, professionalism, conscience, reverence, and vitality" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 229) that he sees in the work of his preferred painters. His worry, when it comes to music and literature rather than painting (where only the Italian Futurists, "with their electric-lit presentation of the more obvious peculiarities of contemporary life and their taste for popular actualities," had been silly enough to attempt "a pictorial expression of Jazz" [<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 221]), is that good artists can be infected by jazz. In music, he admits, jazz had produced one first-rate master: Stravinsky, who, although "too big to be covered by a label" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 222) had been "influenced much by nigger rhythms and nigger methods" and had "composed ragtimes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 221). One tier below him sit the <span style="font-style:italic;">petits maîtres</span> of the jazz movement, notably <span style="font-style:italic;">les six</span>, the group of composers, including Milhaud and Poulenc, associated in Paris with Jean Cocteau. In literature, half an hour reading Cocteau along with Blaise Cendrars would give sufficient idea of what jazz poetry could offer. In prose, James Joyce "effectually, and with a will, rags the literary instrument" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 224). Joyce adopts a principle of syncopation that "flouts traditional rhythms and sequences and grammar and logic," even if he does so with "talents which though genuine are moderate only" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 223, 224). Although Virginia Woolf flirts dangerously with syncopation in some of her writing, she remains among the saveable: "she is not imbued with that spirit which inspires the genuine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Jazz writers, whether of verse that looks oddly like prose or of prose that raises a false hope of turning out to be verse, and conditions all that they produce" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 224) "She is not," in one of Bell's favorite terms of disparagement, "<span style="font-style:italic;">gavroche</span>."</p>
<p>Bell's biggest worry, however, is</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Mr. T. S. Eliot—a poet of uncommon merit and unmistakably in the great line—whose agonizing labours seem to have been eased somewhat by the comfortable ministrations of a black and grinning muse. Apparently it is only by adopting a demurely irreverent attitude, by being primly insolent, and by playing the devil with the instrument of Shakespeare and Milton that Mr. Eliot is able occasionally to deliver himself of one of those complicated and remarkable imaginings of his: apparently it is only in language of an exquisite purity so far as material goes, but twisted and ragged out of easy recognition, that these nurselings can be swathed.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 222–23)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Bell is right about Eliot to the extent that, at this stage of his career, he was not afraid to acknowledge his enjoyment of popular culture or to work its rhythms and iconography into his poetry. In a debate at Oxford in 1914, Eliot rebuked fellow Merton students for disavowing "how much they owed to Amurrican culcher in the drayma (including the movies) in music, in the cocktail, and in the dance."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> For Bell, aesthetic discrimination was "something altogether different from telling a Manhattan from a Martini" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 230). And Bell would hardly have been reassured by a letter in 1919 in which Eliot tries to explain his difficulties as an American outsider—a southern boy with a "nigger drawl," as he once described himself to Herbert Read. In the end, Eliot worries that "I may simply prove to be a savage."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Bell's "Plus de Jazz" can in the end best be understood as an early plea for what in French avant-garde circles a few years later would be called the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>—the title of a book by Jean Cocteau in 1925 that rejected postwar disorientation, hedonism, and anything-goes relativism in favor of the neoclassical virtues of order, discipline, and beauty.</p>
<p>Knowing what the music has gone on to produce, it is easy to say that Bell got jazz wrong. But even more to the point, did Bell get Eliot wrong? Was Eliot really on the side of jazz and opposed to nobility and beauty? It hardly seems likely. So was he doing something beyond Bell's wit? That is, was he experimenting with the possibility that jazz values could be transmuted into "nobility and beauty," or even considering whether "nobility and beauty" might <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> something that jazz had to offer, if they were to survive in the modern world? Might a jazz aesthetic—as evident at this time in Eliot's poetry—actually be pressed into service for a <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> certainly, even willfully, demonstrates some of Bell's jazz vices. Bell deplored the reliance of jazz on surprise; Eliot in a series of essays written while working on the poem repeatedly stresses the aesthetic value of surprise. "The strange, the surprising, is of course essential to art," he declares in July 1921. "The craving for the fantastic, for the strange, is legitimate and perpetual; everyone with a sense of beauty has it."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bell valued "lucidity above all things" and disliked the sensual appeal of jazz to the young. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> is hardly "lucid." This obscurity did not deter <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  some young readers, for whom the poem's appeal lay partly in its rhythms and partly in an intuitive sense that, however classical in its references, it was in tune with other developments in modern culture. In an autobiographical essay in <span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow and Act</span> , for example, Ralph Ellison recalls being taught at school about the poets of the Harlem Renaissance. As he was more interested in jazz than poetry at the time, he respected them without being inspired:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Then came <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land. The Waste Land</span> seized my mind. I was intrigued by its power to move me while eluding my understanding. Somehow its rhythms were often closer to those of jazz than were those of the Negro poets, and even though I could not understand them, its range of allusion was as mixed and as varied as those of Louis Armstrong.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">On the other side of the Atlantic, the poet Louis MacNiece had a similar reaction when he read Eliot's poem in his final year of school in 1926. "We had seen reviews proclaiming him a modern of the moderns and we too wanted to be 'modern'," MacNiece recalled. Although the literary allusions and anthropological symbolism of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> were beyond his grasp too, like Ellison he found an alternative cultural point of entry. "The cinema technique of quick cutting, of surprise juxtapositions, of spotting the everyday detail and making it significant, this would naturally intrigue the novelty-mad adolescent and should, like even the most experimental films, soon become easy to grasp."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>What appealed to Ellison and MacNiece might well have struck Clive Bell as the childish impudence of syncopation, the kind of writing that <span style="font-style:italic;">rags the literary instrument</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">plays the devil with the instrument of Shakespeare and Milton</span>. Almost combatively, however, Eliot weaves the syncopation of popular music into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>'s collage of arcane references. The most famous instance is the allusion to a 1912 song written for the Ziegfeld Follies, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shakespearean Rag</span>, in which Eliot out-syncopates the syncopators by adding a syllable and making it "that Shakespeherian rag." Equally important is the placing of these lines in "The Chess Game" section of the poem. This chess game appears to be a mutually destructive emotional stalemate between a wheedling and resentful female voice and an emotionally cauterized, but silently screaming, male interior voice. Challenged to say what he is thinking, the lifeless male voice first responds with an honesty that is unspeakable—"I think we are in rats' alley / Where the dead men lost their bones"—and then offers bleak and perfunctory reassurance: "Nothing again nothing." Goaded further, the inner voice reinforces the deadliness of despair with the reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>: "Those are pearls that were his eyes." The ragtime reference then bursts into this litany of nihilism as a desperate bid to drown out the bickering and to escape into a different psychic reality that might indeed be "so elegant, so intelligent." This is a more desperate escapism than anything imagined in Bell's caricature of the cocktail drinkers at the Savoy. The rhythm of popular song also interrupts and rags the verse in the "Fire Sermon," in a pastiche that has been linked to the minstrel shows of Eliot's St. Louis childhood.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The shows are evoked explicitly in "The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear," but their "art of mélange" may also structure Eliot's sampling of grotesquely divergent references and quotations <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and their juxtaposition within the context of a nightmarish urban landscape: Spenser, Marvell, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>, John Day's pastoral reference to hunting horns transformed into motor horns, a rude parody of the sentimental ballad <span style="font-style:italic;">Red Wing</span>, Wagner's use of the Grail legend, and a line from Verlaine.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>This promiscuous mixing together of elite and popular culture, of authentic and inauthentic culture, of the valuable and the meretricious was just what Bell meant by <span style="font-style:italic;">ragging</span>, although he would probably have recognized the precision of their orchestration. The difference between Bell and Eliot was not that one believed in normative cultural values, while the other did not. It is more that, whereas Bell operated with a Gresham's Law of culture in which the circulation of bad art must necessarily drive out the good, Eliot was already developing a consciously anthropological understanding of culture as a whole way of life in which high and low necessarily coexist and interact. He was therefore able to see <span style="font-style:italic;">the process of culture</span> as the recombination of these elements in new and distinctive patterns. By the same token, <span style="font-style:italic;">the aesthetic process</span> entails the artist remaking his own experience, and also reworking the words and things and traditions in which that experience is objectified, in new and meaningful patterns. This process of anthropological reinvention through recontextualization is what Eliot applauded in the way that Stravinsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacre du printemps</span>  transformed "the rhythms of the steppes into the scream of the motor horn, the rattle of machinery, the grind of wheels, the beating of iron and steel, the roar of the underground railway, and the other barbaric cries of modern life."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is a process also evident, as his sometime collaborator Gilbert Seldes implies, in Eliot's "use of the rhythms of jazz to contrast with the stately phrases of the past."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In Eliot's art of juxtaposition and montage, to quote in a different rhythm is to transform, to make new.</p>
<p>What Eliot captures in the references to popular music—and also through his invocation of communication machines like the typewriter and the gramophone—is a postwar estrangement of the senses, which transmutes into a disturbing rhythm that is sometimes stultifying and sometimes febrile. This is the inner reality of modern life lived to the tempo of jazz. As F. Scott Fitzgerald observed in "Echoes of the Jazz Age" in 1931: "The word jazz … is associated with a state of nervous stimulation, not unlike that of big cities behind the lines of a war."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was this ethos that Eliot and others were able to transform through, and into, a jazz aesthetic.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ballet mécanique</span></h1>
<p>Born to artists in Boston in 1897, filmmaker Dudley Murphy moved to Southern California in 1915 with his mother and sister when his parents divorced. He dropped out of his engineering studies to become an aviator, flying bombing missions in the final years of the First World War. Returning to Los Angeles after the war, he spent a year as a Hollywood art director and camera apprentice, while also writing about film for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Evening Express</span>. In 1920, he made his first films: three experimental dance shorts synchronized to music by composers such as Debussy. While continuing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to experiment with his "visual symphonies" and sound-image synchronization, Murphy spent August 1921 researching lenses and camera technology at the Physics Department of Dartmouth College. In 1922, he made <span style="font-style:italic;">Danse Macabre</span> to the music of Saint-Saëns, his most ambitious film to date and a departure from Californian imagism in favor of a more expressionist style, conjured up through graphic and animated effects.</p>
<p>By this time, Murphy had developed what remained an abiding passion for the mechanical power of the camera to create new forms of choreography—with a taste for Gothic kitsch thrown in. Having developed his "calling-card" portfolio of films, Murphy headed off to Europe for a couple of years, accompanied by his second wife, the young dancer Katherine Hawley, before returning to his marginal and unpredictable career on the fringes of the American industry. There, he developed a treatment for <span style="font-style:italic;">Skyscraper</span>, a film designed to celebrate "the fantastic speed and rhythm of this jazz age" in New York.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> He was occasionally able to get close to the center of the action, but he always remained on the lookout for opportunities to make the type of films that he believed in—while always hoping too that they would bring him fame and fortune.</p>
<p>One of the surprising things about Murphy as a young American traveling to Europe in 1923 is that, although he took with him novel ideas about cinema as a choreographic medium capable of combining music, dance, and movement, jazz does not appear to have been a central concern to him. Instead, he learned in Europe to embrace jazz, developing elements of a jazz aesthetic for film. The decisive experience was working on what remains his best known achievement: his collaboration with Fernand Léger and others on the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, planned, shot, and edited in Paris over a number of months in 1923 and 1924 and first screened at the Internationale Ausstellung für Theatertechnik in Vienna on 24 September, 1924, has claims to being the definitive avant-garde film of the early 1920s. It was certainly one of the first attempts to create a truly abstract cinema, although whether that abstraction is best described as cubist, dadaist, vorticist, or purist remains open to debate. The film has remained controversial in other ways too, most notably the question of who ought to be regarded as is true begetter, or, more pertinently, begetters. The systematic repression over several decades of Murphy's contribution has now largely been made good, but what role was played by three other large American egos—those of Ezra Pound, Man Ray, and George Antheil—remains an intriguing, if in the end irresolvable, enigma.</p>
<p>In this article, the interest of the film lies in the question whether <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> can usefully be regarded as a jazz film. Does it enrich understanding of the film to view it as a manifestation of a jazz aesthetic or, if that is too narrow a term, then as the product of a jazz ethos that was one important aspect of the modernist milieu of Paris in the first half of the 1920s? If it does, then which elements of the film embody a jazz aesthetic or can be attributed to this jazz ethos?</p>
<p>T. S. Eliot's fellow-poet and fellow-American-in-Europe, Ezra Pound, radically edited <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> to create the version that was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span> in 1921. Pound also had a hand in brokering the connections that led to the production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, and probably in its production as well. When Dudley Murphy arrived <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in Paris, he called on Pound, with whom the Murphy family had shared a holiday in Venice a decade and a half earlier. "Dudley Murphy, " wrote Pound in a letter to his father, "whom I met in Venice in 1908, he being then eleven; turned up a few days ago. His dad is a painter, he is trying to make cinema into art. ETC." (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 52). Pound had developed an interest in the "vortographic" experiments of the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, and he was therefore interested in the lenses (or lens covers) that Murphy had developed at Dartmouth, which produced a similar kaleidoscopic fragmentation of the image. There is some evidence that the two of them did at least some production and editing work on the film, with Pound in January 1924 again reporting to his father: "Also work on vorticism film—experiment interesting—but probably Murphy hasn't brains enough to finish the job in my absence or without pushing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 53). Murphy's recollection in later years—and no one's account of these events wholly squares with anyone else's—emphasizes less collaboration than the way that Pound set in motion the chain of events that led to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: "One day, when I was visiting Ezra Pound and talking about my work, he told me that a friend of his, Ferdinand Leger (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>), wanted to make a movie. Also George Anteil (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>), the young protege of Stravinsky would like to make a movie. So he brought the three of us together and we decided to make one."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>This version does not acknowledge that Murphy had already met another American in Paris, the photographer Man Ray, possibly on 6 July, 1923 at the dadaists' "Evening of the Bearded Heart." Along with music by Milhaud, Satie, and Stravinsky, poems from Apollinaire, Cocteau, and Soupault, and a play by Tristan Tzara, the evening presented screenings of several experimental films, including Man Ray's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le retour à la raison</span>.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Whatever he was doing with Pound and Léger, Murphy seems to have suggested a collaboration with Ray and they started to build up an archive of footage. Out in the city they filmed shop windows, traffic, and an amusement park. They shot various still-life arrangements, a parrot, Murphy himself, images of Katherine Murphy sniffing flowers and sitting prettily on a swing, and extreme close-ups of the mouth and eyes of Man Ray's girlfriend, Kiki de Montparnasse, in flat white mime make-up. (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) They also planned to intercut pornographic footage of the two couples between shots of pistons and other machine parts pumping up and down.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Soon, predictably, the money ran out. At Ezra Pound's prompting, Léger was approached to support the project, and possibly also the American heiress Natalie Barney, who hosted an influential salon in Paris, to underwrite what Léger called "a musical synchronized adaptation" by the expatriate avant-garde composer and self-proclaimed "bad boy of American music" George Antheil—at this time probably more a protégé of Pound's than of Stravinsky's (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 54).</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Antheil claims that he had initiated the whole project. His story is that, in October 1923, he announced in the press that he was working on a new composition to be called "Ballet mécanique" and that he was looking for "a motion-picture accompaniment to this piece" ("BPS," 33). Supposedly egged on by Pound, Murphy accepted the challenge on the condition that he would collaborate with Léger. In the end, working independently and not from any prints, Antheil did produce a score for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  synchronized player-pianos, sirens, motor-horns, electric bells, aeroplane propellers, and assorted other mechanical objects and musical instruments. This noise-based music was well adapted to leading Léger and Murphy's mechanical dance. The only two problems were that it was not completed until 1925 or 1926 and that it was twice as long as the film. Apart from that, Antheil claimed, Léger "said it was beyond his expectations and that it was as right as right can be" ("BPS," 33). Even if that is true, Antheil's intransigence in refusing to adapt the score to an existing print meant that, for many years, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> the film and "Ballet mécanique" the composition led separate lives—to the detriment of both.</p>

<p>Whoever did what, with whom, and in what order, there is no doubt that Léger was becoming more and more interested in film by 1923. In 1922, although contributing nothing himself beyond a poster design, he had followed the progress of Abel Gance's film <span style="font-style:italic;">La Roue (The Wheel</span>) through the participation of his friend, Blaise Cendrars, and he wrote enthusiastically about aspects of the film. It was neither the dramatic nor the emotional dimension that interested him, but "a new plastic contribution" in which a "mechanical element" is crucial: "This new element is presented to us through an infinite variety of methods, from every aspect: close-ups, fixed or moving mechanical fragments, projected at a heightened speed that approaches the state of simultaneity and that crushes and eliminates the human object, reduces its interest, pulverizes it."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>This emphasis on the plastic and the mechanical, and on the new ways of seeing opened up by the close-up and by montage, was no doubt, in part, a projection of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Léger's thinking about his own art. After his traumatic war experience, Léger had reinvented his style, developing a new vocabulary of form, color, and rhythm intended to capture the beat of the modern metropolis. Having been "criticized severely" for tackling "the mechanical element as a plastic possibility," he insists in 1923 that, "The mechanical element <span style="font-style:italic;">is only a means and not an end</span>. I consider it simply plastic 'raw material,' like the elements of a landscape or a still life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 24). What interests him, even if spectators find it challenging, is to create "an intensive organized state," in which "the weight of masses, the relationship of lines, [and] the balance of colors" are subjected to "absolute order" and to "the law of plastic contrasts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 28). "I group contrary values together; flat surfaces opposed to modeled surfaces; volumetric res opposed to the flat façades of houses; molded volumes of plumes of smoke opposed to active surfaces of architecture; pure, flat tones opposed to gray, modulated tones or the reverse" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 29).</p>
<p>These surprising and disconcerting juxtapositions set his work in tune with the times:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We live <span style="font-style:italic;">in a geometric world, it is undeniable, and also in a state of frequent contrasts</span>. The most striking example of this is the advertising billboard—sharp, permanent, immediate, violent—that cuts across the tender and harmonious landscape. A contemporary fashionable party contrasts the men's severe, crisp black clothes with the prettier and more delicately colored dresses of the women. An epoch of contrasts. … So I am consistent with my own time ….</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 30)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The power of film, and especially the power of the close up, lies in "<span style="font-style:italic;">making images seen</span>" and the consequence of the "cinematic revolution" is therefore "<span style="font-style:italic;">to make us see everything that has been merely noticed</span>." Having observed <span style="font-style:italic;">La Roue</span> in production, and having seen how Cendrars constructed a montage sequence to convey the power of a locomotive through rapid cuts, syncopated visual rhythms, and violently contrasting machine imagery, Léger declared that he "wanted to make a film at any cost."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The explicit aim was to create in film what Léger called a <span style="font-style:italic;">machine aesthetic</span>. Hence the selection of objects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: industrial machines and machine-made objects carefully patterned in characteristic Léger assemblages, or in such extreme close-up that they become unrecognizable. He wanted to provoke spectators not just into seeing them anew, but into seeing them as <span style="font-style:italic;">beautiful</span>. But, like his fellow purists Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant, Léger was not after any old fuzzy aestheticism, but a classical, yet uniquely modern, "Beauty." In trying to define the essence of that machine-age beauty, Léger suggests why there are so many saucepan lids, whisks, flan dishes, and other kitchen utensils dancing around in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: "The Beautiful is everywhere: perhaps more in the arrangement of your saucepans in the white walls of your kitchen than in your eighteenth-century living room or in the official museums" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 52–53).</p>
<p>What appealed to Léger about cinema as a vehicle for a machine aesthetic were the possibilities of "the mechanical element" becoming the leading character, of composing visual fragments into an artistic whole (montage), and of introducing a temporal <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  dimension (a <span style="font-style:italic;">modern rhythm</span>) into his art. In 1923, he contributed set designs for a futuristic laboratory that was the setting for the climactic scene in Marcel L'Herbier's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'inhumaine</span>, but it was only in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> that he found the opportunity to create a film that demonstrated the mathematical principles of order, discipline and, especially, rhythm, which he saw as being intrinsic to the times, but which were also indicators of the emerging <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>:<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The particular interest of the film is centered upon the importance which we give to the "fixed image," to its arithmetical, automatic projection, slowed down or accelerated—additional, likeness.</p>
<p>No scenario—Reactions of rhythmic images, that is all.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Judging from his earlier and later films, Murphy probably had a less clearly articulated aesthetic agenda than Léger. Less theoretical than intuitive and hedonistic, Murphy wanted to explore and expand the potential of film as a medium for the creation and representation of dance. One of Murphy's dominant memories was of getting hold of the mannequin legs to be used in the stop-motion Charleston sequence: "In bringing the legs to the studio, I drove through Paris in an open cab, with a leg over each shoulder, screaming. Even the Frenchmen were startled by this" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 46). With Pound, Murphy seems to have been happy to make a vorticist film. He deferred to Man Ray's desire to produce a dadaist celebration of machines and machinery—"I insisted on my Dada approach if we were to work together, to which he readily agreed" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 49). And, when Man Ray decamped, Murphy was able to fit in with Léger's more classical and more disciplined agenda:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We talked over ideas and I set out with my camera and the film, executing the ideas that we had talked over and photographing things that stimulated my imagination around Paris. The premise on which we decided to make the film was based on a belief that surprise of image and rhythm would make a pure film without drawing on any of the other arts, such as writing, acting, painting.</p>
<div class="attrib">("BPS," 31)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This does not mean that Murphy was a naïve technician at the beck and call of egotistical artists. Rather, he was an artist who could learn, pragmatically rather than theoretically, from each of his collaborators—but also a filmmaker who had something to teach them. Just as Murphy acquired from Léger a more considered cinematic grammar for his future dance experiments, so Léger learned from his collaboration on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> a new understanding of the meaning and associations of objects, and new ideas about how to work their kinetic plastic juxtaposition into his future paintings (see "BPS," 42).</p>
<p>This speculation on the provenance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> makes it tempting to suggest that there was something jazz-like about its production. At least five idiosyncratic voices <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  were articulating dissonant styles, and yet somehow they managed to "hear" enough of what the others were doing to be able to respond, interact, and, in the end, produce a single dynamic film art work. This is no more than an analogy; it is not where the film's jazz aesthetic lies. Even so, it does suggest a way of looking at <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> that is more alert to its improvised polyphony than those critical views that want to tie it down to being one thing or another, or belonging only to one author or another. The provocative dadaist voice of Man Ray—"All the films I made were improvisations"—is there in some of the imagery and in the film's eroticism; Pound's residual vorticism can be seen in the kaleidoscopic fragmentation of the image; Léger's "more theoretical" purism shapes the film's structure as well as the look of many of the parts; and perhaps, in the end, it is Murphy's cinematic choreography that holds the whole thing together—preferably to Antheil's machine-music accompaniment.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Seen like this, the opening minutes of the film appear not just as an exercise in abstract cinematic rhythm, but as more argumentative and culturally engaged than is often supposed. Before the title credit, we see Charlot, Léger's Charlie Chaplin marionette, of which more later. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> starts, then, with the mechanical choreography of stop-frame animation, which at the same time not only makes a cubist design dance, but also asserts that this film stands in some sort of relation to the energy and power of popular cinema. After the title, the images appear to be Murphy and Ray's, even if the logic of their montage may largely be Léger's. We see Katherine Murphy, smiling coyly and fluttering her eyelashes on her garden swing (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>) and setting up the underlying metronomic rhythm for the sequence, before the scene is interrupted (in accordance with Léger's graph of the film's construction [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]) by a rapid montage of objects—a bowler hat, numerals, colored circles and triangles (that are Léger's nod to the abstract cinema of Richter, Fischinger, Eggeling, and Ruttmann), bottles, Kiki's mouth demonstrating the rhythmic mechanics of a smile, the bowler hat again, Kiki's mouth again, spinning circular objects that could be umbrellas or just painted discs, a vertiginously gyrating pendulum.</p>
<p>Then the first rhythm is restored by a return to Katherine on her swing, but this time projected upside down. Is this inversion nothing more than a formal device? The visual pun of "the world turned upside down" is hardly new or subtle. Look, it says: this is the ethos of modern dance—feminine, Arcadian, natural—that our film will overturn. Next, reflected in a swinging Christmas-tree ball, whose arc and rhythm replicate exactly those of the inverted swing, we see a movie camera and two men, Murphy operating the camera, Léger in the foreground directing. So: out with the female body in a pastoral setting, in with the mechanical eye of the camera, in with the cameramen who create new ways of seeing, and in with a new vision of modern woman, made up, hair waxed and reduced (like Charlot) to a montage of parts.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point, Murphy's kaleidoscopic prism over the camera lens is brought into action, creating a choreography of objects or part objects—often, so far as they can be made out, saucepan lids, flan dishes, jelly molds, and other kitchen utensils photographed from disorienting angles or distances. This is Léger making us see, and see the plastic beauty of, "<span style="font-style:italic;">everything that has been merely noticed</span>," whether that be these <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">objects or the abstract shapes or the extreme close-ups of Kiki's mouth and eyes, with which they are interchangeable. Then, perhaps as the end point of this prelude, we see Dudley Murphy himself emerging from the jumble of objects, like Venus rising from the surf. (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>)</p>
<p>This way of seeing the film locates it in its cultural moment. And this is where jazz legitimately comes into the analysis. 1923 was still the moment of jazz in Paris, and it is that jazz ethos that is rendered in the mechanical imagery, the plastic contrasts, and the rhythm of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. The most apposite account of the jazz ethos, and one that is more historically alert and more socially nuanced by far than Clive Bell's diatribe, is offered by Michel Leiris in his autobiography, <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhood</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In the period of great license that followed the hostilities, jazz was a sign of allegiance, an orgiastic tribute to the colors of the moment. It functioned magically, and its means of influence can be compared to a kind of possession. It was the element that gave these celebrations their true meaning: a <span style="font-style:italic;">religious</span> meaning, with communion by dance, latent or manifest eroticism, and drinks, the most effective means of bridging the gap that separates individuals from each other at any kind of gathering. Swept along by violent bursts of topical energy, jazz still had enough of a "dying civilization" about it, of humanity blindly submitting to The Machine, to express quite completely the state of mind of at least some of that generation: a more or less conscious demoralization born of the war, a naïve fascination with the comfort and the latest inventions of progress, a predilection for a contemporary setting whose inanity we nonetheless vaguely anticipated, an abandonment to the animal joy of experiencing the influence of a modern rhythm, an underlying aspiration to a new life in which more room would be made for the impassioned frankness we inarticulately longed for. In jazz, too, came the first public appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Negroes</span>, the manifestation and the myth of black Edens which were to lead me to Africa and, beyond Africa, to ethnography.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In this remarkable passage, Leiris identifies several features that resonate with aesthetic and cultural impulses already identified as being at work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. These signs of the time are, therefore, relevant to understanding the alchemy of transmuting jazz context into film art. For Léger, no doubt more than for his American collaborators, the drive behind his radical change of approach and style, in the attempt to create an art adequate to the times, can be attributed at least in part to "demoralization born of the war"; Murphy was the only one to have seen service, but, for him, the experience had been exhilarating rather than traumatic. In their individual ways, the Americans would all have shared Leiris's ethical ambivalence about modernity. Certainly, Léger at this time showed a fascination, whether naïve or not, with "the latest inventions of progress"—including cinema—even if it stopped just short of "blindly submitting to The Machine." In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>'s contrasts between two types of the modern woman, and in the copulatory rhythms and erotic symbolism of its machines and objects, there may well be a gesture toward "the impassioned frankness" about sexual matters that Leiris wistfully invokes.</p>
<p>So far, this catalogue has established a degree of thematic congruence, without yet identifying how jazz as a transformative aesthetic might be at work here. Paradoxically, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a pointer toward that crucial mechanism may be found in one of Leiris's features of jazz, which is manifestly <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> visible in the film: that is, Negroes. Despite that absence, and recalling his reference to "latent or manifest exoticism," it is relevant to recall that this was the moment of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span>, as well as of jazz—or together with jazz, as one of the features of the voguish primitivism was that the two were frequently conflated.</p>

<p>Several of the contributors to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> were very much bound up in <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span>. Although Man Ray's 1926 photographs of Nancy Cunard bedecked in African ornaments and of Kiki de Montparnasse with an African mask are notorious examples, he did have a degree of self-knowledge about his relationship to black art. A year or two before <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, he had shot a slyly ironic portrait of himself. He poses as a stylized jazz drummer, with sticks at the ready and regulation shadows projected on to the wall. There are no drums, however, just a small cymbal attached to what looks, on the wall, very like a grand piano, but which, on closer inspection, turns out to be an ordinary gramophone. Any jazz here is mechanically reproduced, and Man Ray declares himself to be a white consumer, rather than a black producer, of the music; or perhaps his point was that, in the very act of appropriating the music as an expatriate white Jewish American dadaist, he might actually be reworking it according to his own cosmopolitan lights, and so doing something a little bit alchemical.</p>
<p>Most explicit about the impact of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span> on the ethos of the time when <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> was being made was George Antheil. In his contribution to Nancy Cunard's <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> anthology, published in 1934, Antheil recalls how Paris had reacted to African American music a decade earlier: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Since Wagner, music has had two giant blood infusions: first the Slavic, and, in recent times, the Negroid. […] Negro music appeared suddenly (after a gigantic preparation) after the greatest war of all time … it came upon a bankrupt spirituality; to have continued within Slavic mysticism would have induced us all, in 1918, to commit suicide; Negro music made us to remember at least that we still had bodies which had not been exploded by shrapnel and that the cool 4 o'clock morning sunshine still coming over the hot veldt of yesterday was this morning very, very sweet. We needed at this time the licorice smell of Africa and of camel dung … the roar of the lion to remind us that life had been going on a long while and would probably go on a while longer. Weak, miserable, and anaemic, we needed the stalwart shoulders of a younger race to hold the cart awhile till we had gotten the wheel back on. But first acquaintance with this charming and beautiful creature, the Negro, made us love him at first sight; we could not resist him.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here Leiris's "demoralization born of the war" is hyped up into Antheil's "bankrupt spirituality," Leiris's "bursts of tropical energy" and "animal joy" find their parallel in Antheil's realization "at least that we still had bodies" and, above all, Leiris's response to "Negroes" as "the manifestation and the myth of black Edens" is given a eugenicist twist in Antheil's view of "this charming and beautiful creature, the Negro," whose historic role would be to reinvigorate a white race rendered "weak, miserable, and anaemic."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> One difference seems to be that Leiris knew quite well that he was listening to African <span style="font-style:italic;">American</span> jazz, even if it did inspire him to become an anthropologist and work in Africa, whereas Antheil, whether naïvely or disingenuously, reproduces the primitivist conflation between jazz and Africa. Despite all his rhapsodizing over the veldt and the camel dung, however, Antheil also thinks of jazz in terms of a machine aesthetic. The music represents "an incredible musical machinery." "One can scarcely believe," he exclaims, "that one has not to do with a civilized race, <span style="font-style:italic;">masters of steel, mathematics, and engineering</span>, in hearing these choruses from the Congo."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time as he started contributing to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, Léger was designing the costumes, sets, and curtain for <span style="font-style:italic;">La Création du monde</span>, the Ballets Suédois's attempt at a <span style="font-style:italic;">ballet nègre</span>, which had its first performance on 25 October, 1923. With a book by Blaise Cendrars, based on traditional African stories, Léger's designs provided a visual counterpoint to the contemporary jazz-influenced score by Darius Milhaud, newly arrived back from a trip to New York and Harlem. Spiking the worst excesses of primitivism with the spirit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>, Léger and Milhaud aimed for an Africanism stripped down, "purified," and jazzed up as an antidote, again mixed with the logic of the machine, against the decadence and lassitude of contemporary European culture. Léger's set and costume designs may have depicted an anthropologically dubious pastiche of images from the "deepest jungle," filled with "savage idols" and "wild beasts," but he insisted that they were based on "African sculpture from the classical period" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 63) (whenever he imagined that to have been) and that their purpose was to turn dancers into a "mechanism like everything else." Milhaud, likewise, compared the jazz bands he admired to well-oiled machines, and stressed that he used "the jazz style to convey a purely classical feeling."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The inference from the fact that Man Ray, Antheil, and Léger were all caught up with <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span> is that they experienced what Leiris called "the influence of a modern <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  rhythm" through jazz and specifically as "Negro jazz." This is the key condensation: <span style="font-style:italic;">a modern rhythm was at the same time the rhythm of the machine and the rhythm of "Negro music."</span> The claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> embodies a jazz aesthetic therefore rests on the extent to which its vernacular imagery of everyday life and ordinary objects is rhythmically "jazzed," and so given new life. The possibility suggests quite a different reading from that which sees the film as purely abstract, although abstraction is undoubtedly part of the jazzing process in the sense that rendering the world in terms of geometric and tonal images is the necessary first step before those can then be put into a syncopated rhythmic relationship to each other. In 1923, Léger refers to the way that a painting "organized, orchestrated, like a musical score, has geometric necessities exactly the same as those of every objective human creation (commercial or industrial achievement)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 28). In film, those "geometric necessities" are orchestrated temporally and everything becomes rhythm, although rooted in a still recognizable cultural vernacular. The film, in other words, demands both a sensory response that might be described as abstract, and also a more poetic reading that picks up on cultural clues and references.</p>
<p>An example of the predominance of the purely sensory impact of rhythm can be found in the sequence of the washerwoman climbing the stairs. Both Murphy and Léger laid claim to it, and the shades of difference between their accounts are revealing. For Murphy it was an exercise in montage that takes on a certain metaphoric significance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I saw an old washerwoman climbing a flight of stone stairs. When she reached the top, she was tired and made a futile gesture. The scene in itself was banal, but by printing it 20 times and connecting the end of the scene with the beginning of her climb, it expressed the futility of life because she never got there. This scene in the editing followed a very intricate piece of shiny machinery, somehow correlated in movement and rhythm to that of hers.</p>
<div class="attrib">("BPS," 31)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">For Léger, by contrast, the sequence takes to the extreme the principle around which, for him, the film is constructed: "Reactions of rhythmic images, that is all. … We persist up to the point when the eye and spirit of the spectator will no longer accept. We drain out of it every bit of value as a spectacle up to the moment when it becomes insupportable" ("BPS," 38–39). Léger saw the washerwoman sequence in more purely theoretical terms than Murphy. For him, it had nothing to do with the futility of life: it was a mathematical experiment in the effect of rhythm and repetition on the body:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I wanted to <span style="font-style:italic;">amaze</span> the audience first, then make them uneasy, and then push the adventure to the point of exasperation. In order to "time" it properly, I got together a group of workers and people in the neighborhood, and I studied the effect that was <span style="font-style:italic;">produced</span> on them. In eight hours I learned what I wanted to know. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nearly all of them reacted at about the same time</span>.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 51)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of jazzing the semantic vernacular, so that it becomes almost pure rhythm, is the treatment of the cod headline <span style="font-style:italic;">On a volé un collier de perles de 5 millions</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">(Pearl necklace worth 5 million stolen</span>), apparently inspired by the headline "Un collier de 5 millions. On l'a volé naturellement" ("A 5 million necklace. Naturally, it was stolen") in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'intransigeant</span> on 10 September, 1924. Léger regarded advertising, and especially billboards, as part of the "enormous stage set of life" that provided his plastic raw material. But they were also both symbols and expressions of urban life, part of the overload of information that produced the defining urban sensations of temporal discontinuity and spatial disorientation. Léger's original work notes suggest that he had planned to reproduce this modern sense of unease by incorporating and interpreting some of the "plastic and theatrical values" through which commerce intruded into public space, most notably billboards and the press. Such ideas may have been inspired by the American artist Gerald Murphy's set design for <span style="font-style:italic;">Within the Quota</span>, a jazz ballet with a score by Cole Porter that opened as the other half of the Ballets Suédois double bill with <span style="font-style:italic;">La Création du Monde</span> in October 1923. The huge backdrop showed the front page of an American tabloid, with headlines like "UNKNOWN BANKER BUYS ATLANTIC," "Ex-Wife's Heart-Balm Love Tangle," and "RUM RAID LIQUOR BAN." Behind this lay a longstanding cubist fascination with the graphic power of typography, evident not only in a painting like Léger's own <span style="font-style:italic;">The City</span> , but also in Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar, Sheet Music, and Glass</span> , where the chopped-short newspaper masthead LE JOU connotes not only "Journal" but also <span style="font-style:italic;">jouer</span>, to play. In the end, Léger scaled back his ambitions for <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> to a single decontextualized headline. Already unanchored from its story, Léger and Murphy take the headline apart, break it into fragments, reverse those fragments, and stretch them out spatially and temporally. Zeros flash, singly or in groups, then alternate on screen with fragments of the message. Both words and numerals take on a dynamic force that overwhelms any referential meaning. They too become grist to the rhythmic mill: they are jazzed.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In a third example of the film's jazz-like alchemy of the vernacular, the plastic raw material is so freighted with cultural significance that it cannot be drained of value, even though it unquestionably contributes to the rhythm of the film. The raw material, in this case, is the image of Charlie Chaplin, the cubist Charlot marionette. Léger had adored and been inspired by Chaplin's films since Apollinaire had introduced him to them during the war. In 1920 he had provided four illustrations for Yvan Goll's book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Chapliniad: Eine Kinodichtung</span>, and, in 1922, he designed the sets and costumes for Jean Börlin's Ballets Suédois production, <span style="font-style:italic;">Skating Rink</span>. With music by Arthur Honegger, this was based on a poem by the Italian Futurist, Riciotto Canudo, that in turn derived from Chaplin's short, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rink</span> . Between these two projects, Léger had begun to develop quite an elaborate scenario for an animated film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlot Cubiste</span>, and it is material from this uncompleted project that he imported into <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> What Léger most admired about Chaplin, apparently, was his ability to affect and manipulate his audiences. The presence of Charlot at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> may, therefore, be a statement of Léger's faith in the power of cinema in general, and of this film in particular, to control audience response.</p>
<p>"Overwhelmed by the enormous stage set of life," Léger had asked himself, "what can the artist who aspires to conquer his public do?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 36). Opening with the Charlot <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  re suggests that one primary technique for conquering the public in this film will be a certain cinematic <span style="font-style:italic;">rhythm</span>, insofar as Chaplin was widely taken to embody cinematic rhythm. In a 1926 interview, for instance, Murphy insisted that "the secret of Chaplin's success lies in his consummate knowledge of and feeling for tempo" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 62). In the first issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> in 1922/23, another fan, T. S. Eliot, had observed that Chaplin's "egregious" merit lay in the fact that he had "escaped in his own way from the realism of the cinema" and had thus "invented a <span style="font-style:italic;">rhythm</span>."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>On both occasions that Charlot appears, he is juxtaposed against Katherine Murphy. <a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> And, on both occasions, it is the contrast between Charlot's jerky stop-frame choreography and bodily disintegration and the metronymic regularity and balletic elegance of Katherine's human movements that is most striking. At one level, this may be experienced as one of Léger's rhythmic plastic contrasts. At the semantic level, however, the opening contrast needs to be linked to the close-up images of Kiki's mouth, which follow Katherine on the swing and then to the juxtaposition of the swing image inverted against the reflected image of Léger and Murphy.</p>
<p>The sequence of contrasts thus runs in this order:  articulated/disarticulated male marionette re (Charlot);  integrated female human re (Katherine);  disaggregated female re (Kiki);  inverted integrated female re (Katherine);  reflected and distorted male res (Léger and Murphy). From this it may be inferred that the presentation of Katherine as female, classical, and integrated is contrasted against Kiki as female, modern, and disintegrated, and that the disintegrated/reconstituted Charlot may represent a rhythm that is masculine, modern, and urban. The framing of Katherine, before by Charlot and after by Léger/Murphy, also indicates a degree of erotic aggression that is more overt in the second appearance of the Charlot/ Katherine juxtaposition. On this occasion, it follows another of the moments in the film designed to test the limits of the spectator's exasperation: almost half a minute of rapid, split-second intercutting between a round boater and an unmistakably phallic shoe. That visual assault is then relieved by a cut to Katherine, in the garden. The rhythm slows, but then the frenetic Charlot marionette reappears and disassembles, or disintegrates, in reaction to the image of the woman and shoots off-screen left, leaving only his head to tip his hat to the audience. Here Charlot embodies (or disembodies) not just a rhythm of urban modernity, but the demonic energy of modern male sexuality. And this too was part of jazzing.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> should be taken primarily on its own terms, as the presentation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">ballet</span> that is genuinely, and ingeniously, <span style="font-style:italic;">mechanical</span>. This mechanical dance, conjured up though the machinery of cinema, takes a number of forms. The "mechanical element" takes a leading role, as the beauty of all those machine-objects is revealed when they are set in rhythmic motion. The film explores both the mechanics and the aesthetics of the human body as it moves, and the kinetics of the mechanically fragmented image. And it is also an experiment in technologically-mediated, or technologically-created, forms of choreography, both through montage and through animation.</p>
<p>The film does not appear to have been a self-conscious attempt to articulate a jazz aesthetic, in the programmatic sense that Léger wanted it to demonstrate a machine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  aesthetic. Nevertheless, its principles of construction are informed by a chain of cultural associations that linked together, however arbitrarily, machine, modernity, rhythm, jazz, and negritude. And there is evidence that both Léger and Murphy were aware of the jazz dimension of the film, as each came up with his own solution to the non-appearance of Antheil's score. When <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> was first screened at the London Film Society on 14 March, 1926, the program notes make a revealing semi-apology: "Mr. George Antheil was engaged in the composition of music for this picture but, according to Mr. Léger, his music is not likely to be suitably ready for some time and a jazz accompaniment suggested by Mr. Léger will accordingly be played instead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 61). Later that year, when Murphy presented his print of the film at the Film Arts Guild in New York, he quite independently came up with a comparable but distinctly American response: "I got a Negro drummer from Harlem, who played on drums, tin washpans and washboards, and who would watch the film as he played interpretations in his own far-out manner, to the images which excited him on screen" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 61). After the event, and despite their different perspectives, both Léger and Murphy at least <span style="font-style:italic;">heard Ballet mécanique</span> as a jazz film.</p>
<p>Those differences between them remain one of the pleasures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. The film combines an energetic impudence that rags with a new kind of neoclassical discipline that orders, without ever coming down decisively on one side or the other. "The romantic pushes to the left—an excess of subjectivity (a warm state)," observed Léger in 1923. "His opposite pushes toward the right—an excess of objectivity (a cold state)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 30). If Murphy and Ray veered towards this version of the left, here Léger knew himself to be (if only in this sense) a man of the right, predisposed to objectivity above all. The experience of working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, says Léger, taught him "to consider the event of objectivity as a very new contemporary value" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 50).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Encore de jazz</h1>
<p>If there was a jazz aesthetic that informed works like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> in the first half of the 1920s, it turned out to be, for the most part, a passing phenomenon. Many of the artists and intellectuals who had flirted with jazz as a rhythm and as a cultural phenomenon, which could help to convey what it felt like to live in that disconcerting, modernizing, unhappy, and exhilarating time soon turned their back on the music. Comparing Gertrude Stein's style to saxophones and the Charleston in a 1927 review, T. S. Eliot warned that, if her kind of jazz-influenced writing were the way of the future, then the future is "of the barbarians" and that "this is the future in which we ought not to be interested."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> After that, jazz became a private pleasure for Eliot. In France, Darius Milhaud decided that jazz had done whatever good it was going to do, by way of rejuvenating war-battered Western traditions, and that it was time to sign up to the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>. "But already the influence of jazz has passed like a beneficial storm after which one again finds a clearer sky and more stable weather," he wrote. "Little by little the renascent classicism replaces the broken gasps of syncopation."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> article, even if with an overly melodramatic <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  flourish, Antheil called this concerted "reaction" for what it was: "the musical world of Europe" becoming "alarmed at its racial problem." "Every time a white composer was caught consorting with Negro music," he observed, "he was promptly run off and musically lynched; after a vigorous year of campaigning Europe sat back and told itself that Negro music was no more."<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Unaware of such recantations, or unfazed by them, Dudley Murphy returned to a maverick career in the American film industry over the next couple of decades. He wrote much of the dialogue for Tod Browning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span> , he spent some time with William Faulkner fruitlessly exploring the possibility of adapting <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom! Absalom!</span> for the screen, he directed a few mostly undistinguished features in Hollywood and in Mexico, he made some "soundies"—early 1940s forerunners of music videos—and in the 1950s, even in retirement, he tried to persuade Cecil B. DeMille that his old prismatic lenses might solve the problem of parting the Red Sea in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ten Commandments</span> .<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> From his European experience, Murphy seems to have brought back a pleasure in jazz and a vision of cinema as a medium that could combine jazz and dance under the sign of a machine aesthetic: his visual symphonies were now more attuned to a contemporary vernacular than Californian pastoralism. Even though, post-Europe, his jazz aesthetic surfaces only from time to time, when it does it usually constitutes Murphy's best work—most notably in two jazz-based shorts he made for RKO in 1929.</p>
<p>Although famous for Bessie Smith's singing, the most memorable sequence at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Blues</span>  features Jimmy the Pimp (Jimmy Mordecai). Jimmy's louche charisma is celebrated in an astonishing dance that allows Murphy to show what he had learned from Léger and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. As James P. Johnson's band swings into an up-tempo number in a crowded speakeasy, and as a prelude to Jimmy's entrance, the waiters break into a dance that involves them spinning their round metal trays on their fingers. Jimmy glides smoothly around the room greeting acquaintances. As he breaks into his dance, recalling the mechanics of Kiki's face, the washerwoman endlessly repeating her climb up the steps, or Charlot's demonic energy in the earlier film, Jimmy's body becomes machine as his arms flail in circles and his legs drive like pistons around the comparatively still axis of his torso.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Black and Tan</span> , the machine ballet aesthetic turns up in the central "Cotton Club" sequence. A troupe of male dancers, the Five Hot Shots, enters in tight formation from screen left. Disavowing any individuality, these five bodies combine to create a dancing machine: a human train that offers a visual correlative to the sounds of Ellington's streamlined locomotion. This dancing-machine is first duplicated by its reflection in the mirrored floor of the club, and then, motivated as the hallucinatory point of view of the dying Fredi Washington, it is multiplied into kaleidoscope fragments by the same bevelled prisms that Murphy had used on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. A camera-created dance is thus overlaid on to the already machine-like choreography of the dancers. This is very far from the primitivist fantasy of Josephine Baker's <span style="font-style:italic;">danse sauvage</span>, although that is evoked in the costumes of the Cotton Club dancing girls and in Fredi Washington's frenetic, fatal dance. What Murphy was responding to, and seeking <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to develop further, were the geometrical discipline and mechanical precision of the Hot Shots' Black dance: a style of jazz dancing, attuned to the camera, that articulated his sense of a machine aesthetic.</p>
<p>Murphy's film of <span style="font-style:italic;">Emperor Jones</span> , starring Paul Robeson, was supposed, yet again, to kick-start his career—this time after a scandal involving a socialite mistress being found dead in his apartment. Two inexperienced producers, John Krimsky and Gifford Cochran, had made more money than they had expected through the U.S. distribution of Leontine Sagen's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mädchen in Uniform</span>  and were looking to make an artistically adventurous feature. Murphy introduced them to Eugene O'Neill, who, desperate to pay off debts, sold the rights to the play for $30,000. The producers assembled a multitalented team that reflected Murphy's own mix of industry experience, modernist aesthetic, and 1920s Negrophilia. The sound design of the film—overseen, uncredited, by J. Rosamond Johnson, brother of the author James Weldon Johnson—is particularly interesting. Matching the film's narrative sequence of episodic tableaux, recording Brutus Jones's rise from Pullman porter to island Emperor and then his tragic fall back down into madness and death, the music moves in a quasi-anthropological circle, from the African rhythms of the opening (over the image of a circular tom-tom that fills the screen) through the Gullah music of South Carolina, to the sophistication of Harlem jazz, and back to the voodoo tom-tom of the conclusion, a beat calibrated to replicate that of the human heart. The film was predictably controversial, and although it did not lose a great deal of money, Eugene O'Neill's judgment represents the consensus view: "a compromise neither artistic nor commercial."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> More hurtful to Murphy, had he read it, might have been the review in <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> by his fellow experimentalist Herman G. Weinberg, who accused it of lacking the cinematic rhythm that had been so central to Murphy's aesthetic:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p><span style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span> [1929] was ten times better cinema than <span style="font-style:italic;">The Emperor Jones</span>. It had rhythm and swing, cadence shunted into cadence and the whole remained a unity in the mind of the director from its inception. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Emperor Jones</span> as a film has the rhythm of the drum beats but <span style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span> was rhythm personified. It had what René Clair calls "inner rhythm"—it MOVES!<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy was staying true to the idea of a jazz-machine aesthetic that continued as a minority discourse in debates, as often as not in Europe, about the cultural significance of jazz. One intellectual who did not recant his belief in jazz in 1927 was a professor at the Conservatoire Rameau in Paris, Albert Jeanneret. He published an article on "Le Nègre et le jazz" in <span style="font-style:italic;">La revue musicale</span>, which restated the case that jazz, far from being a music opposed to a new classical order, should be welcomed as a contribution to bringing that classicism into being. Describing the creators of good jazz as "masters of steel, mathematics, and engineering"—the exact words used by Antheil for his <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> article seven years later—Jeanneret approached jazz less as a cultural phenomenon, than in formal musical terms. From this perspective, jazz signifies "the restoration of a principle of economy." "The negro brings to European music an imperative recall to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  rhythm," writes Jeanneret. But not without being influenced in return: America has taught "the negro" mathematical structure and "the value of meter." Put African rhythm and European mathematics together, proclaims Jeanneret, and the outcome will be a more muscular and more rational modern music. "One can say then that an intellectualized way of thinking, conditioned by the methods of a productive mathematics and based on physicality and instinct will orient our musical creation towards a new sentiment of order and economy."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Whether it had represented a conscious strategy or an intuitive response to the times, the jazz aesthetic of the early 1920s had been one aspect of broader artistic attempts to give sensory and rhythmical expression to industrial modernization, urban life, and a more inclusive and anthropological conception of culture. Even if it turned out to have put down only shallow cultural roots in European art, jazz modernism had enduring consequences for the connotations and international appeal of black American culture and especially black American music.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In cinema, jazz modernism lingered on fitfully, in the later American films of Dudley Murphy, and in some styles of film musical and film dance. However, Murphy's thwarted film career—he ended up running a classy restaurant and motel in Malibu designed by Richard Neutra and he bought land either wisely or luckily or both—acts as a reminder of a dimension of cinema that is often underplayed. Cinema as a medium is defined neither by photography nor by narrative, even though the mainstream industry thrives by telling and selling character-driven stories. Rather, what defines cinema is <span style="font-style:italic;">movement</span>: the organization of movement over time, and so rhythm, and so choreography. Reconsidered from this point of view, Murphy's obsession with using cinema to make objects dance—whether they be California girls, kitchen utensils, or black male bodies—may turn out to be less eccentric than it appears at first sight. For all his undeniable limitations as a filmmaker, he did at least understand that cinema is a choreography-machine. He spotted an affinity between jazz and cinema in terms of their modernism, as well as their modernity. What jazz and cinema had in common was that both were improvisatory, and both have remade the world by inventing new ways of dancing.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

At least five lengthy drafts of the scenario were penned by Léger; however, the film appears never to have been made, probably due to the lack of financial backing." "BPS," 36.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f43" href="#f43-text">43. </a>Jazz modernism reached its greatest heights in the classic jazz of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and others, but that was by no means the end of the story. On the "revolution in culture" that Bebop represented for Ralph Ellison, for example, see Scott DeVeaux, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Birth of Bebop: A Social and Musical History</span> (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1997).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f44" href="#f44-text">44. </a>This formulation derives from a phrase used by Adrian Martin—"Cinema invents new ways of dancing"—which he originally attributed to Serge Daney. When I asked him about its provenance, however, Martin uncovered a more complicated process of appropriation and rewriting: "Where I (dimly) remembered it from was an essay on Abel Ferrara's <span style="font-style:italic;">King of New York</span> by Nicole Brenez and Sebastien Clerget, written in 1996. Under a still of Christopher Walken dancing, Sebastien had appended a floating quote from Serge Daney: '<span style="font-style:italic;">L'histoire invente des façons de danser</span>.' Now, in the context of their article, this seemed to mean, 'the story invents ways of dancing.' OK. Then I tracked the quote to its source: Daney's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'exercise a été profitable, monsieur</span> (Paris: P.O.L, 1993), a book of Daney's notes and diaries in his final years—and if you know your Fritz Lang pirate movies for kids, you will spot the quote in that title from <span style="font-style:italic;">Moonfleet</span>: 'The exercise has been beneficial, sir.' It's on page 131. BUT in its original context, Daney is talking about the difference between 'scenario' (a film script) and '<span style="font-style:italic;">histoire</span>,' meaning in the context something like 'lived history' (not History with a capital H, which Daney uses elsewhere in the passage to signify Grand World History.) So, in context, Daney muses that whereas, in a movie fiction, one is free to take action, in history one is subjected, prodded, almost a prisoner—and hence 'history invents ways of dancing': 'Dancing with chance, with what is unforeseeable, the amateurism of the world, of clouds, faces ...' To live, one must 'develop a talent for improvisation, like in jazz' (ibid.). To sum up: for Daney, history creates ways of dancing. For Clerget and Brenez, a story invents ways of dancing. And for yours truly, cinema invents (new) ways of dancing!" (E-mail correspondence with the author.) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
