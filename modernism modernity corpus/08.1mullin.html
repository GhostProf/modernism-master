I got hold of the first two volumes of <I>The Secret Doctrine</I> and
read steadily through it, so many pages a day, in the most favourable
conditions for such study . . . . Though I understood so little yet, the
bigness, strangeness, newness of the subject matter, the virility of the
style, the curiosity it awoke in me, held my interest without flagging.

Gretta Cousins's memoirs give a disconcerting account of her
honeymoon. She confesses how she found "bigness, strangeness, newness"
and even "virility" from Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's best-selling
introduction to theosophy, <I>The Secret Doctrine</I>, rather than from
a more conventional source. As though anticipating readerly raised
eyebrows at this substitution of that most fashionable of Edwardian
religious faiths for more usual nuptial pleasures, Gretta explained how
"providential" it was that spiritual matters preoccupied her during
a time of crisis. She grew "white and thin" during her first year of
marriage, not, as friends suspected, on account of her vegetarianism,
but rather due to "problems of adjustment to the revelation that marriage
had brought me as to the physical basis of sex":

Every child I looked at called to my mind the shocking circumstance that
brought about its existence. My new knowledge, though I was lovingly
safeguarded from it, made me ashamed of humanity, and ashamed for it. I
found myself looking on men and women as degraded by this demand of
nature. Something in me revolted then, and has ever since protested
against certain of the techniques of nature concerned with sex. Nor
will I, and many men and women of like nature, including my husband,
be sanctified,

purified and redeemed, life after life, until the evolution of
form has substituted some more artistic way of continuance of the
race. [<I>WTT</I>, 108-09]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On June 15th 1904, and at several other occasions during that significant
month, James Joyce stayed with Gretta Cousins and her husband James,
interspersing evenings with them with his courtship of Nora Barnacle. The
couple were established friends of Joyce, Gretta a talented pianist and
graduate of the Royal university and James a poet and playwright active
in the Literary Revival. To Gretta, Joyce was "a favourite of mine though
he was reputed to be a 'bad boy,'" and she "delighted in his lovely tenor
voice especially when I accompanied some of his Irish songs with nobody
but ourselves to hear in our little drawing room" (<I>WTT</I>, 106). The
affection was only partly reciprocated. Joyce was unable to stomach the
couple's proselytising of theosophy, chastity, and vegetarianism and fled,
grumbling of indigestion resulting from "a typhoid turnip."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 However, Joyce's discontent with the Cousins was grounded in more
 than culinary differences. Gretta Cousins's revulsion from "certain of
 the techniques of nature concerned with sex" exemplifed a theosophical
 somatophobia viewed with predictable ridicule and suspicion by the young
 Joyce, a self-proclaimed sexual radical. "Scylla and Charybdis," the
 ninth episode of <I>Ulysses</I>, performs a deeply subversive assault
 upon these sexual ideologies. "Scylla" assembles before Stephen a
 captive audience of Dublin theosophists, yet the chapter also groans
 with innuendo and sexual excess. This essay will explore this tension,
 documenting how Joyce discloses the fault lines permeating theosophy's
 celebration of chastity through a network of intertextual references
 which recover a buried, latent sexuality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Theosophy was in tune with contemporary social purity campaigns to impose
a single moral standard of sexual continence and self-restraint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Converts were implored to "obtain the power to control their desires,"
 to resist the surrender of "the divine nature to the animal nature":
 celibacy was recommended as having "superior advantages for meditation
 and study," whilst "marital continence" permitted "the union of the
 male spirit with the female soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Disciples, known as "chelas," were expected to remain celibate whilst
 seeking the path to enlightenment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Many theosophists were also dedicated social purists. For Charlotte
 Despard, the pioneering purity feminist Josephine Butler introduced
 "the close connection between the women's movement and the spiritual
 awakening which marked the closing decades of the last century."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Helena Blavatsky's companion Isabel Cooper-Oakley was a prominent
 campaigner for the Social Purity Alliance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 W. T. Stead, whose "Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon" articles exposing
 child prostitution in London had initiated and funded the National
 Vigilance Association, was another celebrity convert.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The Theosophical Society frequently published material which more
 commonly issued from social purity presses. Two theosophy pamphlets
 marketed as "of special interest to women" were Lucy Re-Bartlett's
 <I>Sex and Sanctity</I>, which recommended less of the former and more
 of the latter, and Edith Ward's <I>The Vital Question: An Address on
 Social Purity</I>, a millennial polemic against "marital incontinence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 This dialogue between theosophy and social purity is particularly
 significant for Joyce, since social purity had failed to achieve the

<B></B>

success in Ireland that it enjoyed in Britain. Irish social purity groups
such as the Dublin White Cross Vigilance Association were mistrusted
by Catholic nationalists as Protestant proselytising organisations,
a mistrust encouraged by social purity's enthusiastic Unionism and
imperialist agenda.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 However, theosophy was an important aspect of the Irish Literary
 Revival. John Eglinton asserted that the Celtic Revival was precipitated
 by "the ferment caused in the minds of a group of young men by the
 early activities of the Theosophy Movement in Dublin," and according
 to him W. B. Yeats once declared: "Theosophy has done more for Irish
 literature in three years than Trinity College in its three centuries."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Theosophy was thus a conduit for social purity ideology into an Ireland
 sympathetic to its sexual politics, yet suspicious of its political
 affiliations.

"Aeolus," the seventh episode in <I>Ulysses</I>, notes theosophy's
close links with Dublin's literary establishment when J. J. O'Molloy

The Dublin Hermetist Society was founded by Yeats and George Russell
in 1886.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Hermetists included Revivalist poets James Cousins and Susan Mitchell,
 the journalist Charles Johnstone, the publisher George Roberts and
 Harry Norman, editor of <I>The Irish Homestead</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Many were Joyce's friends or mentors, and, initially caught up in the
 enthusiasm, Joyce acquired one of theosophy's key texts, Henry Olcott's
 <I>A Buddhist Catechism,</I> which he signed "J. A. Joyce, May 7, 1901."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consequently, as Ralph Jenkins notes, Joyce's "knowledge of theosophical
 doctrines is far greater than any commentator has previously pointed
 out."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 This knowledge was extended with later purchases of Annie Besant's
 <I>Une Introduction &agrave; la Th&eacute;osophie</I> and <I>The Path
 of Discipleship</I>, and comes into play in "Scylla," where Stephen
 finally responds to O'Molloy's question.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Stephen's Shakespeare theory has long been discredited as contradictory,
 irrelevant, historically inaccurate, a mere theatrical facade and
 of little literary value, readings all pre-empted by Stephen's own
 declaration that he does not believe in it himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Desmond McCarthy offers one way out of the puzzle, noting how trying
 to discern Shakespeare's personality from the paucity of information
 about him which remains is "like looking at a very dark glazed picture
 in the National Portrait Gallery: at first you see nothing, then you
 begin to recognise features, then you realise that they are your own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Rather than reflecting himself, however, the darkened glass of
 Stephen's Shakespeare portrait ostentatiously holds the mirror up to
 his listeners. As Len Platt notes, Stephen's remark "khaki Hamlets
 don't hesitate to shoot" and his reference to Swinburne's infamous
 defence of the British concentration camps during the Boer War together
 introduce this allegorising drive, as Stephen's Shakespeare is soiled
 by an imperial complicity his Ascendancy listeners defensively disavow
 (<I>U</I>, 9:133).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The allegory is abruptly personalised with "Elizabethan London lay as
 far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin" (<I>U</I>,
 9:149-50). "Virgin Dublin" is political provocation

<B></B>

comparable to "khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot," since again
Stephen uses the supposedly safe domain of literary criticism to mask
a more loaded critique of the contemporary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's pointed parallel between Shakespeare's Stratford and "virgin
Dublin" thus hits below the belt, announcing the focus of his critique to
be the occluded and privatized domain of sex. Individual recollections
of the Dublin Hermetists indicate how earnestly "the sex question"
was pondered:

In those early days we unmarried ones all hoped to become Chelas
and expected to remain celibate, and were rather shocked to hear of
Charles Johnstone's marriage, even to a niece of Madame Blavatsky! The
urges of sex, natural to youngsters in their twenties, were hardly
ever spoken of, except in the disguise of "Karma," and were sternly
suppressed. [<I>MAE</I>, 17]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
George Russell found theosophical conversion an escape from adolescent
"desires of body and heart with which we so soon learn to taint our youth"
(<I>MAE</I>, 12). The predictable serpent was only vanquished when "I
became aware of a mysterious life quickening within my life, carrying
with it unsated desires, base and august, and as I divined it, myriads
of memories and secret wisdom" (<I>MAE</I>, 13). The monthly journal
<I>The Irish Theosophist</I> was similarly voluble. Charles Johnstone
inveighed against "man's animal part," elaborating on the many ways in
which "lust is but a disappointment, to be overcome."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Russell concurred, arguing that "the lower part of man, the body and
 its attachments, be conquered and purified."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 An unsigned article on "The Sex Problem" similarly asked "why cannot
 love be noble?" since "the soul is sexless and passionless."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 These individual reminiscences indicate how "virgin Dublin" was part
 of an international theosophical insistence upon asexuality. Celibacy
 was a condition of enlightenment, and "chelas" were urged to live in
 quasi-monastic communes like that at Ely Place. Blavatsky shared her
 London home with several prominent theosophists, and conspicuously
 led by example, responding to allegations of bigamy and illegitimate
 children with the characteristically bizarre claim that "I could never
 have connection with any man because I am lacking something and the
 place is filled up with some crooked cucumber."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Annie Besant was only admitted into the movement on recanting her
 notorious teachings on contraception. She destroyed unsold copies
 of <I>The Law of Population</I>, writing <I>Theosophy and the Law of
 Population</I> in replacement, which advocated complete abstinence,
 since "the sexual instinct that man has in common with the brute is
 the most fruitful source of human misery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 These attempts to eradicate desire were summarised in the movement's
 motto, "A Universal Brotherhood of Humanity without distinction of race,
 creed, sex, caste or colour."

The celebration of fraternity as an ideal state of sexless companionship
is subverted from the opening pages of "Scylla and Charybdis." "Formless

from paternity to fraternity:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen pointedly segregates the sexes, listing the men--Daniel
Dunlop, editor of <I>The Irish Theosophist</I>, William Quan Judge,
the Irish-American co-founder of the Theosophical Society, A.E., Koot
Hoomi, the Tibetan "master" or "mahatma" who supposedly precipitated
spirit-messages to Blavatsky--before the women, Blavatsky and Isabel
Cooper-Oakley. This gender segregation is summarized with "brotherhood
of the great white lodge," the association of benign Masters who watched
over the faithful from a higher spiritual plane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Stephen mentally maps out an ideologically loaded modulation of the
 "family of man" metaphor. Theosophy's ideal of "Universal Brotherhood"
 reassessed the family of man not as a reproductive unit, but as the
 terminal stage of biological and social development. By displacing
 "allfather, the heavenly man" with "brothers of the great white lodge,"
 Stephen draws attention to how theosophical egalitarianism censored the
 dangerous dynamism of sexual reproduction from a familiar metaphor. The
 process of this displacement is emphasized with "Christ with the
 bridesister," where Stephen linguistically demarcates the point of
 transformation, as "bride" mutates into chaste "sister." As Stephen
 suggests, the sibling relationship offered theosophists a safely celibate
 paradigm for the containment of potentially transgressive desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen builds up, however, to an imagined scenario which provocatively
retrieves the fissures implicit in theosophy's version of siblinghood. He
recalls Madame Blavatsky's insistence that her "elemental" or ghost
would appear to her followers after her death, and Isabel Cooper-Oakley's
much-publicised claim to have been so visited. While Blavatsky is "our
very illustrious sister," she is also a perverse sexual exhibitionist,
flaunting her "elemental" to her friend, and Stephen's pun on "elemental"
/ "genital" here transforms sisterhood into a predictable dirty joke,
disclosing a repressed lesbian longing behind the celibate facade. Stephen
suggests that theosophy's conspicuous disdain for heterosexuality or
"straight sex" in favour of an asexual sibling bond in fact masks
a sexuality that contemporary standards would have judged perverted
or corrupt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 It is therefore significant that Stephen's internal monologue is
 induced by George Russell's theory that "art has to reveal to us ideas,
 formless spiritual essences" (<I>U</I>, 9: 48-9). Stephen notes
 how Russell's aesthetics stem from his theosophy and retaliates by
 placing that connection under scrutiny. Russell "impatiently" objects
 to Stephen's Shakespeare theory with "all this prying into the family
 life of a great man" (<I>U</I>, 9:181). His objection is revealingly
 defensive, since Stephen's unfolding of "the brother-motive" radically
 challenges theosophy's view of brotherhood as egalitarian and asexual
 (<I>U</I>, 9:956). If theosophy presented brotherhood as a benignly
 "spiritualized" alternative

<B></B>

to the disruptive dynamism of sexuality, then Stephen reappraises
the relationship, building upon his insinuation about Blavatsky and
Cooper-Oakley to present the sibling bond not as an alternative to
sex, but as a bizarre perversion of it. His theory that Ann Hathaway's
"misconduct with the brothers" so obsessed Shakespeare that "the theme
of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in
one is what the poor is not, always with him" disconcertingly sexualises
fraternity (<I>U</I>, 9:963, 998). Stephen's detection of the brothers'
names in <I>Richard III</I> and <I>King Lear</I>, together with his
reading of <I>Hamlet</I> as an autobiographical account of sexual
rivalry between brothers, locks the Shakespeare siblings into a stifling
homosocial bond, where sexuality is not directed towards the outside
world, but is instead turned inwards, mediated through Ann Hathaway and
thereby towards each other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This provocative portrait of brotherhood as sexual claustrophobia is
intensified with the spectre of incest. While Stephen's reference to
"a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world,
stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its
breach" alludes to incestuous acts between fathers and sons, the question
of homosexual desire within the family it raises contributes towards
Stephen's investigation of another form of "bodily shame" (<I>U</I>, 9:
850-2). Stephen's "love that dare not speak its name" (<I>U</I>,
9: 659) is incest between brothers, a taboo desire which Stephen archly
presents as barely contained through the brothers' sexual sharing of Ann
Hathaway. This development of the incest theme is evident in Stephen's
initial insistence on the relationship between male members of a family
as one of jealousy, fear and revulsion: "the images of other males of his
blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to
foretell or to repeat himself" (<I>U</I>, 9:433-5). However, Stephen
soon revises this vision of repulsion into one of ambivalent desire: one
of the selves Stephen insists we encounter as "we walk through ourselves"
is "brothers-in-love" (<I>U</I>, 9:1046). The ambiguous re of the
brother-in-love collapses the distinction between the homosocial and
the homosexual, implying how a brother having sex with a brother's wife
is thereby engaging in indirect incest. These hints of this shocking
sexual taboo are confirmed and compounded, as Susan Sutliff Brown has
fascinatingly shown, by Joyce's perplexing concealment of the names of
his own brothers within <I>Ulysses</I>. Following the autobiographical
invitation extended in "Scylla" to search for the names of <I>Joyce's</I> three brothers George, Charles, and Stanislaus, Brown notes that all
appear in "sexually explicit or suggestive connection with either Stephen
or Bloom or both." Thus, George appears in "Scylla" and elsewhere as
"Georgina Johnson," or Stephen's favourite prostitute, Charles appears
as "Charles Alberta Marsh," the voyeur who contemplates sex with the
"bisexually abnormal" Bloom in "Circe," while a Madame Stanislaus is
coupled with the cross-dressing Gerald, the performer who Bloom claims
"converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was a female impersonator
in the High School Play."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 These disconcerting visions of the Joyce brothers in real or fantasised
 sexual encounters with Joyce's fictional counterparts thus ironically
 substantiate Stephen's Shakespeare theory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ann Hathaway's "misconduct with the brothers" thus boldly challenges
theosophy's ideological attachment to brotherhood as safely celibate. The
impact of Stephen's insinuations

<B></B>

is indicated when Stephen responds to Eglinton's "severe" rebuke, "the
doctor can tell us what those words mean" by declining his interpretation
of incest as requiring the psychoanalysis of "the new Viennese school"
(<I>U</I>, 9:738, 780). Instead, Stephen displaces Freud with Aquinas to
elaborate upon his vision of Shakespeare as enthusiastic and exploitative
capitalist, a "moneylender with ten tons of corn hoarded in the famine
riots" (<I>U</I>, 9:743). He asserts that incest is "an avarice of the
emotions," since "the love so given to one near in blood is covetously
withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it" (<I>U</I>,
9:781-3). Incest is here presented as a perversely obsessional form
of self-absorption, where sex, like gold, is hoarded from the outside
world. The onanistic ramifications of this suggestion are elaborated:
"we walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men,
young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves"
(<I>U</I>, 9:1044-6).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Brothers-in-love" moves seamlessly on to "always meeting ourselves,"
a juxtaposition which refers back to Stephen's earlier insistence
that one's male relatives are "grotesque" shadowings of the self to
assert a continuity between brother-love and self-love. Brotherhood is
envisioned as a turning away from life, an unhealthy repression of or
internalization of sexual energies, rather than a utopian state. Stephen's
sustained hypothesis of a correspondence between brotherhood and a
timid, self-absorbed sexuality implies the sterile frustrations behind
theosophy's emphasis upon platonic restraint. Elsewhere in "Scylla,"
Stephen expands upon these hints that theosophy conceals an insular,
claustrophobic and obsessive sexual solipsism.

the Astral Plane
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's hypothesis of "brotherhood" as a form of latent, displaced
sexuality, rather than the utopian asexual state which theosophy
celebrated, exemplifies a sustained rhetorical strategy. Elsewhere in
<I>Ulysses</I>, Joyce subverts theosophy from within, performing highly
ironic interrogations of its enthusiasm for chastity by eroticizing its
ideology and language. If theosophy's interpretation of "brotherhood" as
a sanitised alternative to sexuality is wilfully undercut in Stephen's
reading of "the brother motive" in Shakespeare, then so too is another
central aspect of its belief and practice. While theosophy was committed
to "brotherhood," it was more notoriously concerned not with relationships
between the living, but with those between the living and the dead. It
developed from the late-Victorian enthusiasm for spiritualism and
its materialisation seances and automatic writings which indicated to
believers a secret spectral sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Blavatsky was an acclaimed spiritualist medium during the late 1870s,
 and she began to promote spiritualism's faith in the paranormal within
 the context of wider occult lore.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 With <I>Isis Unveiled</I>  and <I>The Secret Doctrine</I> ,
 she drew heavily on esoteric Buddhism to interpret paranormal events as
 evidence for a new religious faith. Theosophy's appropriation of Buddhism
 and other Eastern doctrines focused particularly upon reincarnation,
 and spirit manifestations were accordingly interpreted as evidence for
 the durability of the soul after death. Blavatsky argued

<B></B>

that this "divine wisdom" was telepathically disclosed to her by the
Masters or Mahatmas, Tibetan spirits who communicated their intentions
through automatic writings and seance manifestations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 When Stephen begins his Shakespeare discourse with the question "what
 is a ghost?" (<I>U</I>, 9:147) he provocatively names the privileged
 object of theosophical quest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One significant premonition of Stephen's strategy of subversive
appropriation occurred in 1904, when Joyce and Buck Mulligan's prototype,
Oliver St John Gogarty, broke into the Dublin theosophical lodge shortly
before a meeting. There, the two discovered what Stephen remembers as a
"Yogibogeybox in Dawson Chambers" (<I>U</I>, 9:281), a spirit cabinet
usually taking the form of a curtained box or large cupboard accessible
only from the front (<I>DR</I>, 46). Next to this "Yogibogeybox" stood
a packing case belonging to George Roberts, at the time combining his
theosophical investigations with a day-job as a traveling underwear
salesman. Joyce purloined a particularly elaborate pair of drawers,
stringing them aloft in the centre of the room suggestively balanced
on a broom handle, while Gogarty attached a note reading "I never
did it" and signed "John Eglinton" as a final flourish (<I>JJ</I>,
174). These high-jinks take on a particularly arch resonance, since
billowing Edwardian knickers produced from a packing case reproduce the
culturally expected image of ghosthood, a nebulous apparition clothed
in white draperies. Joyce and Gogarty's biting visual pun thus placed
on show that sexuality which theosophy tried to repress. Their student
prank burlesqued theosophy's ostentatious chastity by questioning the
nature of the repressed spectres which haunted its members' imaginations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's discourse on ghosts may be more intellectually complex
than Joyce's 1904 practical joke, but it relies upon similar methods
of provoking unease. Stephen similarly manipulates his audiences'
expectations and preconceptions about ghosts to draw a parallel between
the sexual and the spectral. John Eglinton, the most obvious butt of
Joyce and Gogarty's wit, introduces this substitution: "He will have it
that <I>Hamlet</I> is a ghost story, John Eglinton said for Mr Best's
behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep"
(<I>U</I>, 9:141). Eglinton's commonplace misreading of Dickens is
significant. The fat boy refers not to a paranormal occurrence, but to
his vision of the middle-aged lovers Miss Wardle and Mr Tupman "a-huggin
and a-kissin" in a summerhouse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 The following day the fat boy leads Miss Wardle's mother to the
 summerhouse, announces "I wants to make your flesh creep" and tells
 her what he has seen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Eglinton's misremembrance of the context of the much-quoted line thus
 operates in "Scylla" as something of a Freudian slip, as he substitutes
 a ghost story for a sexual secret. Stephen takes up this confusion, as
 his initial attempt to define "what is a ghost" as "one who has faded
 into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
 manners" is soon displaced by an erotically charged account of ghosthood
 (<I>U</I>, 9:147-9). Stephen's argument that Shakespeare should
 be identified with the ghost of King Hamlet relies upon the two men's
 shared identity as cuckolds sexually betrayed by their own brothers. King
 Hamlet's ghost is "endowed with knowledge" of "the poisoning and the
 beast with two backs that urged it" by his "creator," Shakespeare
 "weary of the creation he has piled up to hide himself from himself, an

<B></B>

old dog licking an old sore" (<I>U</I>, 9:470-2). Stephen thus
entangles ghosthood with sexual obsession: his ghosts remain haunted by
the body, its desires, its humiliations. These touches are consolidated
when Stephen responds to Eglinton's objection to his lascivious portrait
of Ann Hathaway. "Carping," Eglinton complains "her ghost at least has
been laid for ever." (<I>U</I>, 9:215). For Stephen, Hathaway's ghost
is laid in another sense:

The "local color" Stephen provides to "make [his listeners] accomplices"
takes the form of a highly sexualized backdrop: Sir Walter Raleigh's
"pair of fancy stays," the excessive amount of underlinen hoarded by the
"gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor," "the punks of the bankside, a penny a time,"
"the holy office the ostler does for the stallion" (<I>U</I>, 9:158,
629, 630, 640, 664). Eglinton's ghost "laid for ever" is resuscitated
with such lecherous fervour that Russell, disgusted, rises to leave
for <I>The Homestead</I>, <I></I>his departure prompting a flurry of
invitations to an evening party from which Stephen is pointedly excluded.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Stephen resumes, he significantly offers a metaphor which imagines
ghosthood as an indelible physical trace. Stephen argues that the
"image of the unliving son" bears the traces of "the ghost of the unquiet
father," "as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born,
though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time" (<I>U</I>,
9:379-81). This provocative confusion between the spectral and the
somatic is pointedly sustained elsewhere in <I>Ulysses</I>, where ghosts
are inevitably entangled with sexual encounters or imagery. In "Proteus,"
Stephen's recollection of his dying mother, "the ghostcandle to light her
agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face" is disconcertingly spliced to
his fantasy of the primal scene of his conception: "the man with my voice
and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They clasped and
sundered, did the coupler's will" (<I>U</I>, 3:46-7). In "Hades,"
this association between ghosts and the erotic is taken up by Bloom,
who rephrases the occult as a form of aphrodisiac: "tell her a ghost
story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? . . . Still
they'd kiss right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards"
(<I>U</I>, 6:754-7). Later Bloom expands on the quasi-necrophiliac
effects of this scenario:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This connection between ghosts and sex is reprised in "Circe," where
Bella commands Bloom to "tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody
good ghost story," and where the Croppy Boy "gives up the ghost" as
"a violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through
his deathclothes" (<I>U</I>, 15:3053, 4548). Such macabre associations
enter into dialogue with the kind of anxieties about ghosts and the body
which preoccupied contemporary theosophy.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such anxieties are pointedly addressed in "Cyclops." Alf claims to
have seen Paddy Dignam in Capel Street that morning, his companions are
superstitiously appalled: "You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between
us and harm" (<I>U</I>, 12:326). Alf's spectral sighting is written up
in the jargon of a typical seance report: "in the darkness, spirit hands
were felt to flutter," and Dignam's "etheric double" is disclosed through
"a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light . . . . orangefiery
and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus"
(<I>U</I>, 12:338-44). The "etheric double" was a specific type of
ghost defined in Charles Webster Leadbeater's <I>The Astral Plane</I>
as the spectral state closest to the flesh and comparable to purgatory,
since the virtuous swiftly moved along into "the devanchic condition
where alone his spiritual aspirations can find full fruition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Joyce's "etheric double" of Paddy Dignam, as Leadbeater predicts,
 is indeed preoccupied with the somatic: he requests buttermilk,
 worries about funeral costs, and instructs his son to retrieve a
 boot "under the commode in the return room," while maintaining
 that the spirit world is equipped with such incongruous modern
 conveniences as "t&atilde;l&atilde;f&atilde;n&atilde;,
 &atilde;l&atilde;v&atilde;t&atilde;r,
 h&atilde;t&atilde;k&atilde;ld&atilde;,
 w&atilde;t&atilde;kl&atilde;s&atilde;t" (<I>U</I>, 12:368, 354). Dignam's
 spirit particularly resembles the "etheric double" of the "victim of
 sudden death," abruptly severed from an "earth-life low and brutal,
 selfish and sensual":

His haunts include Capel Street, a slumland backstreet where disreputable
amusements like Mutoscope parlours are to be found, Barney Kiernan's pub,
and later Nighttown outside Bella Cohen's brothel, where he addresses
Bloom: "I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!" (<I>U</I>,
15:1218). More strikingly still, Leadbeater insisted that the "auric egg"
or spirit mist could be classified through color, and that "a lurid,
flaming red" indicated "animal passions"; significantly, not only is
Dignam's "auric egg" of the appropriate debased shade, but also the
"orangefiery and scarlet rays" shine forth from a suggestive zone of
the body, the "sacral region," a coy euphemism for the groin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce's parodic vision of ghosthood as a disconcertingly somatic condition
demonstrates the specificity of his knowledge of theosophy's doctrinal
nuances. Paddy Dignam's etheric double behaves exactly as Charles
Leadbeater predicted the ghost of an "impure" man who met a sudden death
would act: he is preoccupied with the banal and the worldly, he manifests
in the disreputable places he favoured in life, he even emits the fiery
red aura of "animal passions" from his groin. These close coincidences
argue for Joyce's willingness to subvert the minutiae of theosophical
doctrine for his own purposes. To read "Cyclops" and "Scylla" together is
to note how closely Joyce engaged with a fiercely contested issue within
theosophy: the problem of unruly spirit manifestations and the affiliated
question of supernatural desire. Many converts found comfort in the
idea of an asexual paradise awaiting the faithful beyond the grave. For
Charlotte Despard, "In the spiritual world there is no sex. 'There',
said a Master, 'shall

<B></B>

be neither marrying nor giving in marriage; but they shall be as the
angels of God in heaven.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 For W. T. Stead "love beyond the borderland" was reassuringly
 distinct from this life's "temporary passion which is not love, but
 self-indulgence of the worst shape."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 For G. R. S. Mead, editor of the occult journal <I>The Quest,</I> the
 Masters dwelt on "lofty planes of pure morality," while for Gretta
 Cousins, as we have seen, the future world was one where sex would
 be transcended.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 However, Charles Leadbeater provided a controversial and opposing view of
 an afterlife saturated with taboo sexual desires. <I>The Astral Plane</I>
 addressed a disconcerting fault line in contemporary occultism: if the
 afterlife transcended the body's material concerns, how to account for
 the atmosphere of sexual excess which came to dominate seances?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Within the late-Victorian spiritualist movement, materialization
seances like the one Joyce spoofs in "Cyclops" had acquired a certain
notoriety. Young, pretty female mediums entered the spirit cabinet
as exemplary res of Victorian decorum, then appeared as spirits
whose appearance and behaviour was in tantalizing contrast to their
conventionally modest demeanor (<I>DR</I>, 219-56). The acclaimed
medium Elizabeth D'Esperance produced "Yolande," who was "a beautiful Arab
girl, olive-skinned and dark haired," and who appeared in the flimsiest
interpretation of Egyptian costume, while her rival Florence Cook's
"Katie King," dressed in diaphanous robes, accepted bouquets and gifts,
kissed and sat on the laps of male admirers, and invited enthusiasts
to "pass their hands over her dress in order that they might satisfy
themselves she wore only a robe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Other spectacular evidences of supernatural presences, such as the
 ectoplasmic extrusions from later mediums' mouths, nipples and, on
 occasion, genitals, compounded existing suspicions that it was sex,
 not ghosts, that occult practitioners were really liberating.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This seance eroticism was widely publicized since spiritualist enthusiasm
was repeatedly linked by a hostile medical establishment to hysteria, a
condition with unsavoury sexual connotations (<I>DR</I>, 139). Dr. Forbes
Winslow set the tone: "The community of believers contains a large
proportion of weak-minded, hysterical women in whom the seeds of disorder
are only waiting for a new excitement to ripen into maturity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 <I>The British Medical Journal</I> concurred: "Hysteria is doubtless
 the disease which more than any other furnishes the most abundant crop
 of fruit to the Spiritualists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 For Henry Maudsley, one of the leading Victorian medical
 psychopathologists, the ecstatic state of mediumship was mere "emotional
 incontinence" resulting from "irregularities of menstruation and
 suspected self-abuse" and an excess of "heavily disguised venereal
 passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 These responses indicate how closely occult practice was linked
 to diseased sexuality, and place Joyce's own lively responses to
 seances in sudden relief. Flaunting ladies' bloomers in Ely Place
 in 1904 seems a loaded allusion to the practices which sullied the
 reputation of contemporary occultism, an allusion shadowed in Stephen
 Dedalus's seemingly gratuitous references to Elizabeth Tudor's hoard of
 underlinen and Walter Raleigh's "fancy stays." Joyce places on show what
 commonly issued from the spirit cabinet; scantily clad "ghosts," who
 disconcertingly resembled the smutty postcards, indecent stereoscopes,
 and <I>tableaux vivants</I> of popular erotic entertainments. Sly
 allusions to an occultism repeatedly constituted as a displaced

<B></B>

form of "venereal passions" are elaborated in Stephen's oppressive stream
of innuendo and his discussion of ghosthood as a condition of sexual
obsession. Stephen's Shakespeare theory is resonant of the scepticism
of the late-Victorian medical establishment which attributed seance
manifestations to sexually stigmatised hysteria. His insistence that
theosophy is an indirect, evasive and obsessional way of negotiating
a sexuality which alternately terrified and fascinated his listeners
is rendered particularly specific in the closing pages of "Scylla,"
where Buck Mulligan effervescently "reads" Stephen's theory to disclose
its hidden slur. Mulligan repeatedly constitutes masturbation as the
concealed vice of "that hermetic crowd," alluding, as we shall see,
to sustained and well-publicised contemporary cultural anxieties.

3. Charles Webster Leadbeater: Theosophy in the "Foul Masturbation
Abyss"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1906, a Chicago theosophist, Helen Dennis, discovered a letter to
her thirteen year old son from Charles Leadbeater, the deputy leader of
the London-Adyar branch of the Theosophy Society. Written in a simple
code, it instructed her son to masturbate twice weekly, and included
the damning line "glad sensation is so pleasant."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Leadbeater was called before a disciplinary committee in London
 dominated by social purity sympathizers, where he argued that he was
 "clairvoyantly aware" of the "sex problems" tormenting his young pupils,
 and so advocated masturbation as a "a preventative against unchastity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 His "safety-valve" defence radically departed from the social purity
 orthodoxy that masturbation was a debilitating evil in itself, leading
 to physical decay, mental instability, emasculation, and further
 immoralities. It failed to convince the London committee, and Leadbeater
 was expelled. His influence as "one of the world's foremost scientists
 in spiritual research," however, meant that the scandal could not be
 so simply contained (<I>EB</I>, 5). The 1907 trial confirmed rumours
 prevalent since 1897, when Leadbeater began to urge parents to entrust
 the spiritual development of their sons to him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 His flamboyant chastity further exacerbated suspicions: he pointedly
 refused to shake hands with women at meetings, and, when a guest
 of married couples, insisted they occupy separate bedrooms for the
 duration of his stay, eccentricities which prompted one host to comment
 "his tastes run mainly to boys and tapioca pudding" (<I>EB</I>, 199).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Those who hoped in 1907 for an "end to this wretched controversy"
 which had for the past decade "threatened to plunge Theosophy into the
 foul masturbation abyss" were disappointed (<I>LC</I>, 18). Supporters
 of Leadbeater were numerous enough to force the London committee to
 reaffirm their decision in 1909.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 By then, publicity threatened to render "the public propagation of
 theosophy impossible"; it was vital "to rid the Theosophical Society of
 this foul blot upon its name and fame," and such fears were not unfounded
 (<I>LC</I>, 5). Throughout 1909 the London paper <I>John Bull</I> ran
 a sustained campaign, running headlines such as "A Teacher of Filth"
 and "Pitiful Degradation of the London Theosophical Lodge," while its
 editor Horace Bottomley, M. P., threatened to alert the Director of
 Public Prosecutions that "the Theosophical society is gathering into
 it ranks an army of morbid moral degenerates whose teachings are

<B></B>

calculated to undermine the character and sap the manhood of our race"
(<I>LC</I>, 20).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Other English papers concurred with <I>John Bull</I>: the <I>New
 Statesman</I> noted that no other modern adventurer had built up such
 a police dossier, while the <I>Times</I> and the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>
 regularly ran articles of protest in a similar vein (<I>EB</I>, 180). The
 controversy rumbled on well into the 1920s, following Leadbeater to
 India, where his adoption of two Hindu boys prompted their father to sue
 for restitution of his children in 1912 in a bizarre lawsuit combining
 charges of deification and sodomy, and to Australia where a series of
 articles in the Sydney <I>Daily Telegraph</I> during 1922 prompted a
 full-scale police investigation (<I>EB</I>, 200).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the global and highly public nature of "the Leadbeater affair,"
one might speculate that Joyce, an avowed sceptic who, I have urged,
borrowed from key Leadbeater texts, relished the scandal. Certainly,
speculation that Joyce knew of theosophy's seamier side are encouraged
in the closing pages of "Scylla." Masturbation is the centrepiece of
Buck Mulligan's parody of the Hermetists who listen to Stephen, and its
centrality must have been bitingly resonant by 1919 and 1920, when Joyce
was composing the chapter and theosophy had already endured more than
two decades of persistent scandal over the solitary vice. Mulligan builds
upon a theme slyly introduced by Stephen, who draws an implicit parallel
between Hamlet, "an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself,"
and his listeners, "unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder
nightly each his variorum edition of <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>"
(<I>U</I>, 9:1052, 1062). Stephen presents both Hamlet and his audience
as ghosthunters terrified of procreative, interactive sexuality and
instead confined to the sexual cul-de-sac of autoeroticism. Hamlet
is "a wife unto himself," and the bawdy ramifications of his sexual
self-reliance are drawn out with the word "fingerponder," an intrusion
of the manual heavily weighted with double entendre. Stephen associates
literary Dublin with the kind of forestalled sexuality which Mulligan
will later castigate as particularly Irish in "Oxen of the Sun,"
and these insinuations are voluble in the context of theosophy's
associations. Leadbeater's enthusiasm for masturbation was only the most
notorious instance of a contraceptive strain running through theosophy,
not only through its insistence on chastity, but more problematically
through Blavatsky's often-repeated claim that a "crooked cucumber"
guaranteed her celibacy, and through Annie Besant's troubling past as a
radical campaigner for birth control. Stephen's hints that theosophical
sexuality is strangulated, sterile, and secretly self-indulgent are taken
up by Mulligan, who offers Eglinton the parting-shot "Monsieur Moore,
. . . lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland" (<I>U</I>,
9:1001-2). Mulligan makes the associative leap between contraception,
or "conjugal onanism" as it was widely known, and masturbation with his
parody of Yeats's 1903 "Baile and Aillinn." Yeats's poem would no doubt
have delighted the Hermetists, since it celebrated lovers who transcended
sexual union in favour of the higher spiritual affinities to be found
in the afterlife, thus evading the decay and disappointments of sexuality:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yeats's vision of love purified is drastically burlesqued by Mulligan,
who transforms a virtue into a necessity. Yeats's "curlew cry" becomes
a "purlieu cry," the lure of the brothel area Joyce later presented
as Nighttown, where British "Tommies" like Privates Carr and Compton
patrolled in search of women (<I>U</I>, 9:1043, 1044). Yeats's chaste
lovers are displaced by a more incongruous pairing, Eglinton and the
minor Revivalist Frederick M'Curdy Atkinson, bound together through a
chastity produced not through restraint so much as incapacity. Atkinson's
"wooden leg" and Eglinton/Magee's "chinless mouth" "that never dared to
slake his drouth" are cruelly visceral metonyms of impotence, in ironic
contrast to Yeats's lovers, whose chaste progress to the afterlife spares
them somatic decay (<I>U</I>, 9:1147, 1149, 1150). Mulligan ascribes their
purity not to spiritual strength, but to mental and corporeal weakness:
"Being afraid to marry on earth / They masturbated for all they were
worth" (<I>U</I>, 9:1150-1. With his spoof play for "the mummers":

and its hero "Toby Tostoff, a ruined Pole," he extends his view
of Eglinton's and Atkinson's sexuality to the whole of the Dublin
theosophical-literary establishment (<I>U</I>, 9:1181). Mulligan's puns
on "French letters," his parody of Yeats, and his spoof play for the
Abbey together read the various cultural enterprises of the Revival as
substitutions for and evasions of sexual creativity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Scylla and Charybdis" is thus structured to reveal pervasive cultural
associations between a Revivalism intimately connected to theosophy and
a secretive sexual deviancy. Stephen's Shakespeare theory allegorically
interrogates theosophy to unfold provocative connections with a cautious,
concealed, and claustrophobic sexuality; Mulligan's verbal play names
this sexuality as masturbation, thus alluding to a highly contentious
scandal which theosophy was trying to conceal. If, as I have argued,
the Leadbeater affair is a submerged intertext in "Scylla," then the
chapter parallels the repressive hypothesis which dogged contemporary
occultism. The Leadbeater controversy was so eloquent to theosophy's
critics because it articulated in a particularly obvious manner the
sexuality suspected to lurk beneath theosophy's high-minded facade,
exposing fault lines in that facade already evident in speculations
over spiritualism's salacious seance manifestations, Blavatsky's marital
status and illegitimate children, or even Annie Besant's former enthusiasm
for contraception. This repressive dynamic is similarly encoded within
"Scylla," where Mulligan's remarks explicate Stephen's Shakespeare
monologue: his naming of masturbation as the dark side of theosophical
chastity offers

<B></B>

to retrieve what the movement's sexual politics buried. Masturbation in
"Scylla" is thus deeply politically resonant, as Joyce uses Mulligan to
signpost the implications of Stephen's monologue in that "history of
cultural conflict" which Len Platt defines as central to "Scylla." If
"Scylla" is an episode dominated, as Platt suggests, by snide attacks
and bitter asides, by submerged hostilities and battles for cultural
possession and prestige, then Stephen's assault upon theosophy's sexual
pretensions is a particularly effective instance of this maliciously
playful sniping.

4. The Sewer of Their Clique: Theosophy, Joyce, and Censorship
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A further dimension to Joyce's sustained attack on theosophical sexuality
can be glimpsed in the publication history of "Scylla." Writing to Harriet
Shaw Weaver in October 1918, Joyce regretted "my book <I>Ulysses</I>
appears to be giving you a great deal of trouble," adding "I am writing
now the Hamlet episode" (i.e., "Scylla and Charybdis").
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Joyce linked Weaver's eventually thwarted attempts to find a British
 printer willing to risk the obscenity laws and print episodes of
 <I>Ulysses</I> in the <I>Egoist</I> with the composition of "Scylla,"
 a connection which must have become increasingly evident as the months
 progressed. Joyce was composing the first draft of "Scylla" from late
 1918 through to February 1919, and was simultaneously preoccupied
 with <I>Ulysses's</I> travails with the censors in the United States,
 where the novel was appearing in Margaret Anderson's and Jane Heap's the
 <I>Little Review</I> (<I>JJ</I>, 441-2). The <I>Little Review</I>
 was first suppressed in January, 1919, when John Sumner, chairman of
 the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, forced the U.S. Post
 Office to confiscate the "Lestrygonians" number. It was confiscated under
 a law initiated by Sumner's predecessor, the notorious vice crusader
 Antony Comstock, which prohibited material deemed obscene from being
 distributed through the postal system.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Further confrontation with these moral vigilantes was to come:
 "Scylla" itself was confiscated in May 1919, "Nausicaa" in August,
 and in February 1921 social purity triumphed over <I>Ulysses</I> when
 The <I>Little Review</I> was convicted of obscenity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Margaret Anderson had struggled with Sumner for some years, unwillingly
attempting to appease the N.Y.S.S.V. in the May, 1919, issue of her
journal, where she prefaced "Scylla" with a complaint over the January
confiscation: "To avoid a similar interference this month, I have ruined
Mr Joyce's story by cutting certain passages in which he mentions natural
facts known to everyone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 However, while Anderson in America was excising "natural facts," Joyce
 was adding them: successive drafts of "Scylla" disclose a process of
 revision with a distinct flavor of Joycean bloody-mindedness. The
 revision process began in late 1918, when Joyce added specific
 theosophical details to <I>The Little Review</I> proofs; "allfather,
 the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful," "the life
 esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first"
 and "the name ineffable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 However, after "Scylla's" suppression in May 1919, Joyce's revising
 pencil is directed not so much towards theosophy, but more to the
 chapter's disputed sexual content. In November 1920, alterations for
 Sylvia Beach's planned edition exacerbate the allusions: "argive Helen"
 becomes "the wooden mare

<B></B>

of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept," the passage describing
various "incests and bestialities" which Anderson reluctantly removed is
elaborated with "lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name"
(<I>JJA</I> 18: 182, 198).
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Joyce adds also "between conjugal love and its chaste delights and
 scortatory love and its foul pleasures," and, more provokingly still,
 transforms Ann Hathaway into a faded, jaded tract-reading Puritan, a
 dangerous equivalent to contemporary purity censors: "She read or had
 read to her his chapbooks, preferring them to <I>The Merry Wives</I> and
 thought over <I>Hooks and Eyes For Believer's Breeches</I> and <I>The
 Most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze</I>"
 (<I>JJA</I> 18: 197). In late 1921, making final revisions to the
 Darentiere and Beach galley proofs in the aftermath of <I>The Little
 Review's</I> suppression that year, "Scylla" becomes more confrontational
 still. "Prologue to the swelling act" is added to Stephen's initial
 portrait of Ann Hathaway, "jailbirds with keyholes" to the "incest and
 bestialities" catalogue Anderson felt forced to censor (<I>JJA</I>
 23: 248, 332). Furthermore, the final couplet of Buck Mulligan's
 Yeats parody, "being afraid to marry upon earth / They masturbated
 for all they were worth," only appears on this final revision: until
 then, Joyce avoided naming so explicitly the solitary vice for which
 theosophy had become renown (<I>JJA</I> 23: 340). Joyce's modifications
 emphasise, rather than tone down, the connections between theosophy
 and a disordered sexuality my chapter has outlined. His modifications
 can only be interpreted as deliberate defiance of the vice-crusaders
 which made <I>Ulysses</I> a target.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two early poems, "The Holy Office"  and "Gas From a Burner"
 offer a key to the role of theosophy in Joyce's strategy
of provocation. Both responded to Joyce's early experiences of
sexually-motivated censorship. "The Holy Office" was distributed after
Harry Norman refused to take any more <I>Dubliners</I> stories for <I>The
Irish Homestead</I> on the grounds that "his readers had complained,"
and after Joyce's essay "The Day of the Rabblement," attacking the Irish
Literary Theatre for producing moral but mediocre Irish plays had been
rejected by <I>St. Stephen's,</I> the University College magazine to
which Joyce also unsuccessfully submitted the poem itself. "Gas from a
Burner" commented on the collapse of negotiations with George Roberts
to publish <I>Dubliners</I>: Roberts complained "the book's implication
were anti-Irish and therefore out of keeping with an Irish publisher,"
whilse his printer George Falconer reneged on a promise to sell Joyce
the sheets, burning them instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Joyce made his assault upon social purity censors more explicit still
 in his initial title, "Mr Falconer Addresses the Vigilance Committee."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 The broadsides foreshadow Joyce's critical method in "Scylla" because
 both associate the threat of censorship with theosophy. "The Holy Office"
 singled out Dublin Hermetists Yeats, Roberts, Russell and Eglinton for
 particular censure; "all these men of whom I speak / Make me the sewer
 of their clique. / That they may dream their dreamy dreams / I carry
 off their filthy streams" (<I>PSW</I>, 98). Joyce's insistence that
 his "office of Katharsis" ventilated the kinds of somatic desires
 theosophists, with their "timid arses," feared to acknowledge was
 repeated in "Gas from a Burner." Ventriloquizing George Roberts, Joyce
 complained "I printed mystical books in dozens: / I printed the table
 book of Cousins / Though (asking your pardon) as for the verse / T'would
 give you a heartburn on your arse" (<I>PSW</I>, 104). Having assumed a

<B></B>

corollary between Roberts's timid refusal to print <I>Dubliners</I>
and his role as a staunch supporter of theosophical effusions, Joyce
again insists that mysticism and bad verse masked a furtive, secretive,
and dishonest sexuality: "In the porch of my printing institute / The
poor and deserving prostitute / Plays every night at catch-as-catch-can /
With her tight-breeched British artilleryman" (<I>PSW</I>, 105). Joyce's
striking image of Maunsell and Company at night metonymically discloses
the underbelly of its daytime reputation for moral probity. Sexual
transgression hovers ratively on the porch of the establishment,
under cloak of darkness: so Joyce suggests it lurks on the margins and in
the shadows of Irish theosophy, a disavowed yet nonetheless present force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These broadsides offer an intriguing perspective on "Scylla" because they
emphasize how closely the young Joyce's early experiences of censorship
were bound up with and attributed to Irish theosophical prudery. In
"Scylla," written fifteen years after his flight from Dublin, Joyce
addresses the contemporary censorship threat at one remove, returning
to the Dublin of his youth, where theosophy was the strand of social
purity ideology most influential in Irish literary circles. Theosophy
stands for social purity censorship in "Scylla": its sexual timidity
exemplifies a wider climate of artistic censorship with which Joyce's
writings so often conflicted. Joyce's assault upon theosophy is thus
a metonymic assault upon the censorious gaze. His revisions show how,
during the months <I>Ulysses</I> was under this gaze, Joyce elaborated and
amplified the provocative connections between theosophy and the obscene
which have been outlined. His revisions make bold one of "Scylla's"
themes; how sexual tensions disrupt the moralizing facade. Sexuality
seethes through "Scylla," most obviously in Stephen's innuendo-laden
Shakespeare theory which playfully subverts theosophy's doctrinal
enthusiasms for brotherhood and ghosthood as states of inviolable
purity. Stephen reappraises "universal brotherhood" as a stifling
homosocial bond, ghosthood as a condition of sexual obsession, and
"Scylla" slyly substantiates the theosophical resonances of his argument
as Joyce encodes allusions to contemporary suspicions and scandals which
theosophy was unable to contain. By anchoring theosophy to the kinds
of scandals it unsuccessfully attempted to ignore, from spiritualism's
associations with sexual hysteria to, more specifically, the long-running
Leadbeater controversy, Joyce places moralizing discourses of sexual
proscription upon an eloquent continuum. The prostitute on the porch of
Maunsell and Company in "Gas from a Burner" is marginal, extraneous to the
institution, in its shadow: in "Scylla," Joyce goes further, representing
sexuality not as a force prudishly excluded from theosophy and clamouring
at the door to be let in, but rather as intrinsic to it, submerged within
a discourse of chastity which, as the Leadbeater case so devastatingly
suggested, incites while it prohibits. Joyce's depiction of theosophy in
"Scylla and Charybdis" argues that rather than repressing and controlling
sexuality, moralizing propagandists covertly participate in and amplify
the desires they deny. "Scylla" thus contributes to a sustained Joycean
theme: the underground correlation between vice and vigilance.
