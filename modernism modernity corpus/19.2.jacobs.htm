D. W. Griffith brought lots of them himself. The heroine with her bundle of shame, the too-too honest love suspected of all but the audience, the industriously and unreasonably active villain, one hundred per cent wicked for twenty-four hours of the day, the snow, the comic relief and all. This was good. The grand old heart-wringing melodramas, “the stuff to give ‘em,” are good, sound, moving stuff. They are traditional in the best sense (in a popular tradition), even purge with pity and terror, and keep the flame of pure drama alive until genius comes in, every hundred years or so, to lift it to the regions of pure art.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.2pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">While many literary intellectuals of the 1920s simply dismissed melodrama as sentimental bunk, e.g., H.

She has sent her daughter Rosamund to boarding school to be raised, and kept her in ignorance of their real relationship. When Rosamund shows up unexpectedly at the Palace of Fortune, Baby tells Petworth that if he ever tells Rosamond that she is her mother, she will kill him. While Baby is entertaining men, who drink a toast to her, Rosamund comes downstairs in one of her mother’s dresses and attracts many admirers. Initially unaware of what has transpired, Baby eventually realizes what is going on, fights off the men and takes the girl upstairs. Left alone, Rosamund realizes the kind of work that Baby does (it seems extraordinary that it took her as long as it did to do so) and runs away, leaving a letter that thanks Baby for her help but refuses any more, given its source.

This sets the terms for a contextualization of his American films of the 1950s. Halliday writes: “Sirk himself in the interview strongly insists on the need to historicize the American melodrama. This is not simply because of the nature of the studio (the immediate conditions of production), but also because of the condition of society as a whole, at the time basking complacently under Eisenhower, while already disintegrating from within.” The interview gave rise to explicitly Brechtian readings of Sirk, e.g., Paul Willemen, “Distanciation and Douglas Sirk,” and to many more analyses of American 1950s domestic dramas as representations of a social fabric under stress.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:16px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Thomas Elsaesser’s well-known essay “Tales of Sound and Fury: Observations on the Family Melo</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">drama” relates melodrama to modernism in at least two ways.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The first is with what might be considered a Brechtian aesthetic via Sirk: melodrama downplays narrative logic and plausibility, those linchpins of real</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ism, in favor of overt symbolism and marked stylistic devices.

I will then consider the example of the director John Stahl, well-known as a specialist in domestic drama, who transformed his style over the course of a decade between 1924 and 1934, moving from a naïve, or old-fashioned, form of melodrama to a more modern one. I would emphasize that I am using the word “modern” in a circumscribed and relative sense: what looked like something new to filmmakers and critics on the ground in the 1920s. </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="margin-bottom:13px; margin-left:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold; color:#221E1F">Sophisticated and Naïve Taste </SPAN></H5><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:207px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Throughout the 1920s, the trade press and most of the popular press attributed sophisticated taste to the clientele of the big first-run theaters on Broadway and other metropolitan centers, while naïve taste was associated with the neighborhood and small-town the</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">aters.

The genre is worth considering briefly since Stahl made such films, and they seem to have influenced his treatment of the domestic drama. Sophisticated comedies were held to be the acme of stylistic refinement, understated and restrained, and thus in opposition to hokum effects, and to slapstick, understood as a subset of hokum.

Nonetheless, I would argue that a number of directors who had experience with sophisticated comedy in the 1920s began to elaborate a “sophisticated” treatment of melodrama: they include Monta Bell and Edmund Goulding, who did their most experimental work in the 1920s, and Leo McCarey and John Stahl, whose experiments occurred largely in the 1930s. </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="margin-bottom:13px; margin-left:31px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold; color:#221E1F">John Stahl </SPAN></H5><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">It is difficult to reconstruct the trajectory of John Stahl’s career in the 1920s.

The plot is both highly convoluted and highly stereotyped. It includes two recognition scenes both of which are implausibly delayed. The first comes at the end of the film’s second act, when Rosamund finally realizes that the woman who has been supporting her at a distance for years is in fact her mother. The second comes at the denouement, when Brabazon realizes that his estranged wife Helen Grey was the notorious Baby Brabant and that Brabant’s daughter Rosamund is in fact his child. There is also a scene, familiar from no less a warhorse than </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">La Dame aux Camélias</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, of the father asking the heroine to give up his son (in this case his adopted son) for his own good. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The film virtually abandons any attempt at plausible character motivation and psy</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">chology in order to orchestrate big dramatic climaxes. For example, when Rosamund initially arrives at the Palace of Fortune nightclub, one might expect that even a girl raised in a convent school would be able to figure out that it was a place of bad repute, and that Baby Brabant made her living by dubious means. But Rosamund lingers in ignorance and insists on leaving Baby’s quarters, against advice. This allows Stahl to set up a racy contrast between mother and daughter within the setting of the nightclub, one that is driven home by the staging. Having put aside her school clothes for one of Brabant’s dresses, Rosamund comes down the wide central staircase that dominates the set just as her mother, unaware of her presence, is unveiling a painting of a naked woman to a group of male admirers gathered around. As a crowd of men toast Baby, Rosamund is visible on the stairway at the rear, flanked by her own admirers. The dou</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">bling of the two women within the mise en scène, seconded by the use of the portrait, emphatically underlines the threat facing the heroine as well as playing up the moral contrast between mother and daughter. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In addition to its sensationalism, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Sowing the Wind </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">is highly moralized. After Rosa</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">mund finally realizes the nature of Brabant’s job and runs away, Brabant can not keep up her efforts to entertain the men in the club and hysterically denounces them. She is fired that night, and walks down the central stair and stands in front of the double front doors, head bowed. An image of a young girl in a white dress with flowers is superimposed on the left side of the frame. Brabant reaches out to her, followed by a narrative title: “Poor Baby Brabant, you’ve had beauty and youth and the world at your feet, and you’ve chosen—” Here the superimposed image on the left points to the right, where another superimposed image appears, this one clearly Baby Brabant, in a black dress with pearls, holding up a drink.

The three superimpositions, at first apparently Brabant’s subjective impression (at least she reaches out to the first one), take on a life of their own, approaching her and eventually swallowing up the space of the night club and even Brabant’s own presence. While trite in terms of the moral they express, the titles are also used in an extremely interesting way—identifying the meaning of the superimpositions (“the primrose path”), speaking for them (“now come with me”) and growing in size, perhaps to mimic the effect of the old woman approaching the camera, when they state the film’s title. At this point the titles no longer seem to be addressed to the character, who has dissolved into the symbolic representation of her decline, but to the spectator. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The treatment of the first recognition scene is similarly sensationalistic and played for maximum effect. Petworth, evil owner of the Palace of Fortune nightclub, insists on taking Rosamund, now a prominent actress, to see Baby Brabant, who he says is ill. He takes the girl to an apothecary’s shop in Chinatown where they gain admittance to an opium den, sequestered behind a secret door. Inside the den, they discover Baby Brabant, sitting on a bed and holding a pillow as if it were a baby. Aged and infirm, she appears to be doped up and speaks to the pillow: “If only once I could have heard you call me—‘mother.’” Moved, Rosamund asks Petworth what is going on and he replies: “You thought yourself too good for my house! Now look and see—just who and what you are! </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">That woman is—your mother!</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">” Rosamund expresses shock, then tenderness as she calls out and tries to embrace her mother. When Baby Brabant backs away, Rosamund begins to cry. Baby slowly turns away from Rosamund and very slowly looks down at the pillow, then drops it. After indicating mental weakness and distress, Baby Brabant stares at the impassive Petworth. Then, trying to protect her daughter, she wildly denies being Rosamund’s mother, accuses Petworth of lying and, assuming a hunched, almost ape-like posture, she threatens him, and approaches as if to choke him. The stress is too much for her and she falls, dead. Rosamund kneels in long shot behind Baby’s corpse. Cut to a close up of the pillow, then back to the long shot of the two women. Rosamund speaks: “You wanted your baby to call you ‘Mother.’” She caresses her mother’s hair, then realizing she is dead, she pulls back, rises. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:210px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Many elements contribute to the heightening of this scene which, while certainly far-fetched and per</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">haps somewhat risible in description, I actually find quite compelling when screened. First, the dimly lit and seedy opium den is a fantastically incongruous place for Rosamund to discover her mother. Second, Myrtle Stedman’s performance as Baby Brabant is quite carefully calibrated: beginning in a slow-moving, drug-induced daze, she shifts into a different register, moving more quickly and gesturing more and more vividly as she tries to deny Petworth and take revenge on him. This is abruptly cut short by her death and Rosamund’s gruesome realization that she has been caressing a corpse. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:16px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Sowing the Wind </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">is the work of a young and fairly inexperienced director and there are points where the pacing falters and the plotting becomes obscure.

Indeed, the review in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Variety </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(August 30, 1932: 9) praised the way that Stahl and scriptwriter Gladys Lehman condensed the long time span of Fanny Hurst’s original novel. The basic structuring device that allows this condensation of the novel is the systematic use of the marked ellipses that separate and define the acts. The first act, which takes place in Cincinnati, ends when Ray misses a chance to meet Walter and his mother, and thereby any chance to gain permission to marry him, because she has to deal with an emergency posed by her younger sister, unmarried, pregnant, and threatening suicide. The second act, in New York City, follows a lapse of five years. A chance meeting on the street between Ray and Walter, who is now married to someone else, leads to dinner and Walter’s admission that he still cares for her. She becomes his mistress.

Chaplin’s film cuts from Marie at a rural railroad station, after Jean has missed their rendezvous, to a Paris restaurant, one year later, where Marie, already Pierre’s mistress, appears in his company. This transition was much praised in the 1920s (for example, it is mentioned by Eisenstein).</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>28 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Stahl not only uses this device </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:64px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">316 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">to cover the time between the missed meeting and the initiation of the love affair in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, he uses it again in the transition between the second and third acts. In despair at her boredom and loneliness as the other woman in Walter’s life, Ray returns to Cincinnati and to a former boyfriend, Kurt, who has proposed marriage. Walter follows her there and urges her to stay with him, to which she responds with a question “If I do go back, where will it end?” The film cuts to a view of railroad tracks as seen from a moving train and the title “1932” which grows in size as if approaching the camera. Twenty-five years have elapsed and Walter is traveling to Paris with his wife and grown children while Ray, who takes the same boat, discreetly maintains her distance. In Paris, Walter’s son confronts Ray and condemns her, but Walter defends their relationship. The next day, prostrated by a stroke, he pleads with his son to place a call to Ray and he is connected to her via telephone when he dies. After the funeral, Ray has a fantasy of herself as a young girl, meeting Walter and his mother in the ap</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">pointed place, and getting permission to marry. She dies. While the film takes many of its incidents from Hurst’s novel, it is much more eco</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">nomical. The novel covers a longer span of Ray’s life (for example, she lives on after Walter’s death in poverty and isolation) and there are no marked temporal gaps of the sort that define the act structure of the film. Even within the acts, Stahl favors a con</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">densed representation of events. For example, take the sequence of four short scenes in Act 2 that convey Ray’s decision to become Walter’s mistress. After the meeting on the street, they are shown at a restaurant: there is a brief exchange of glances but no dialogue. Inside a cab, Walter pays Ray compliments and asks if she has any special friends in New York and she says no. Outside the same cab, they stand in front of her rooming house in the snow, and she explains that men and dogs are not permitted by the landlady. Walter confesses that he still loves her. They try to kiss but are interrupted when illuminated by the lights of a passing car. He departs making a date for Saturday. The film cuts to Walter waiting for Ray in the shelter of a doorway; presumably it is Saturday. Her cab pulls up and, as she greets him, he invites her inside, to her evident surprise. They enter an apartment upstairs and there is a brief conversation: </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-left:63px; line-height:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; font-variant:small-caps; color:#221E1F">W</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:6.3pt; font-variant:small-caps; color:#221E1F">alter</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">: It’s for you Ray</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">.

There is no scenario of temptation and doubt, Walter is no villain and Ray no wilting or self-sacrificing heroine. In addition, one does not have a sense that either character is overwhelmed by passion in these scenes although their mutual attraction is evident. Walter’s declaration of love is not heightened by the elements of film style: there is no music, no close ups. In its place we have simply the presence of the characters on the street at night, the awkwardness of the car lights, the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">rule of no dogs and no gentlemen.

Given the censorship difficulties posed by this film in general, and the scenes described above in particular, it might be argued that the elliptical narration of events was a way of avoiding cuts by state cen<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif"></SPAN>sor boards or industry censors (the Studio Relations Committee). But the brevity and matter-of-fact presentation also obviates the kind of moral didacticism that the SRC typically recommended as a way of dealing with such potentially offensive material.<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt"><Sup>29 </Sup></SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In addition to its narrative economy and lack of moralizing, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">differs from a film like </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Sowing the Wind </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">in its style.

Stahl eschews close ups and even medium shots in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">. Shot-reverse-shot is rarely used, reserved for moments of intense drama, such as Kurt’s second proposal when he seems to offer an escape from Ray’s life with Walter, and Walter’s death bed, when, barely able to speak, he looks pleadingly at his son to get him to call Ray on the phone. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">A good example of the film’s dedramatized mode of narration is the scene of the missed meeting at the close of the first act. Ray arrives late at the bandstand and wan</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ders through the crowd as it disperses. In the final shot, she is left alone as the sound dies away and the camera tracks back—there are no close ups and no dialogue calls attention to her chagrin at the unfortunate coincidence. In the following scene in New York, she and Walter make light of the missed meeting when he playfully accuses her of standing him up. It is not until the film’s final scene, when Ray, dying, imagines herself meeting Walter and his mother, that the scene takes on its full weight of pathos. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Every dramatic climax in the film is treated in a similarly reduced manner. Take, for example, the climactic scene in the second act, in which Ray decides she can not continue to live as Walter’s mistress. Walter has been sent to Europe on a business trip. Under orders from his knowing boss (his wife’s uncle) he has taken his wife along. Ray is left alone in the flat in New York, enduring a hot and lonely summer. Walter returns just at the moment when Ray is advising a young neighbor, Francine, that she should give up her married boyfriend and opt for a life of respectability. Once he enters, she rushes to embrace him despite her words. Over the scene that follows, however, it becomes clear that her position is intolerable—a fact conveyed by an accumulation of oversights mentioned in passing and hardly stressed by the actors or the film’s style. Walter sits with his head in Ray’s lap framed in a medium long shot unbroken for over three minutes while evidence accumulates of his unthinking selfishness. He brags that unlike New York, which has been hot all summer, Europe was pleasantly cool. When he finished conducting his business negotiations he spontaneously decided to take a four-week tour with his wife through Switzerland (deliciously cool), France, and Italy. Ray mentions that she has only had three postcards, and describes her own summer </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:; margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:10px; margin-left:64px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">318 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">of solitaire, sewing, and selling pottery she made herself. He objects to this enterprise on her part, but then realizes that he forgot to make provision for her during his im</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">provised four-week European tour. She says the lack of money was not “inconvenient” but that she is lonely without occupation or friends and finally asks him to give her a child. Walter is shocked and rises up from the couch, initiating a cut to a long shot of the couple with Ray seated and Walter near the door background right. He explains that a baby would mean scandal and ruin for him: “After all, Ray, you are not my wife.” He reverses himself enough to kneel down beside and apologize, but then walks to the rear, to put on his coat in preparation for leaving. There is a cut-in to medium shot of Ray sitting silently on the couch—as close as the scene ever gets to a close up. Throughout this shot and the next she hardly moves or changes expression. Cut back to the long shot as Walter kisses her, goes off frame right to get his hat and exits. The camera holds on Ray sitting motionless, then tracks in. Cut to Walter, seen from behind in the hall. He pauses, but since we do not see his face it is hard to hypothesize about his feelings at this moment. Cut back to Ray in medium shot. She slowly rises, the camera tilting up to follow her as she moans softly. Cut as she approaches the window opposite the couch, raises the blind and the window. She stops and turns at the sound of a knock at the door and the film cuts to Kurt, entering. While the accumulation of insults to Ray makes Walter look boorish, he is in no way a melodramatic, “unreasonably active” villain: his vanity and self-absorption are petty and commonplace in a way that a character like Petworth in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Sowing the Wind </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">is not. Moreover, the suicide is remarkably underplayed by director and actress—to the point that audiences might not pick up on it (although the idea is underscored by the parallel between Ray and her younger sister Frieda who threatened suicide by jumping from a window earlier in the film). Still the casual and unmarked staging of the incipient suicide, and its lack of consequent narrative development, seem astonishing for any classical Hollywood film, and much more for a melodrama that one would expect to build to such a climactic moment and to prolong it. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">’s deliberately flat and uninflected style was received with a mixture of praise and trepidation, like the sophisticated comedies that served as its models. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Variety </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(August 30, 1932: 14) dubbed the film a winner and, while the reviewer classified the film as a “tear-jerker,” he went on to note: “At no time is it sleazily sentimental.

And if so, in what sense of the word “mod</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ern”? It should be noted that </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">probably does not adhere to the Halliday/ Elsaesser model of melodrama’s affinities with modernism: no flagrant heightening of emotion or foregrounding of stylistic devices disturbs the integrity of the diegesis or the spectator’s absorption. Indeed, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Sowing the Wind </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">probably fits the terms of the Halliday/Elsaesser model more closely, given its startling use of intertitles and abstract symbolism, and its loose treatment of verisimilitude and character psychology. But, I think it is probably a mistake to judge the domestic dramas of the 1920s and 1930s in the light of what came later: that is, Sirk, Minnelli, and Ophüls as viewed through the lens of Brecht and Benjamin. Rather, I think we have to judge these films against the backdrop of what they were trying to get away from. In this perspective </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Back Street </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">and the other films Stahl made at Universal in the 1930s may be seen as a rejecting the sentimentality and morality associated with naive taste and opting for a new, lean, fast-paced and unemphatic style.
