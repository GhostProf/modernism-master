<p>
Ever since Anthony Julius's <i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary
Form</i> passionately contended that Eliot "was civil to Jews he knew,
offensive to those who merely knew him through his work," many of Eliot's
admirers have ached to repair the damage.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Ronald Schuchard's scholarly and elegant argument, constructed for this
 purpose, amounts I'm afraid to a one-sided brief for the defence. Why,
 though, when there is obvious evidence to the contrary, strain to make
 Eliot into a "philo-Semite"  and turn him into a less interesting
 re than he was (especially when overstating the case diminishes
 the impact of important new correspondence)? It is not, after all,
 enough to say that some of Eliot's best friends were Jewish. Or that
 they knew about the texts that offended Julius and did not care. Ezra
 Pound, too, had life-long Jewish friends like Louis Zukofsky and he
 too wrote frankly to them about his problems with other Jews.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 But that neither absolves Pound of his more obsessive anti-Semitism nor
 absolves us from acknowledging that Pound's anti-Semitism sometimes
 made his poetry more resonant because it embodied cultural attitudes
 that were far from his alone.

<p>
Recall some texts that Schuchard puts to one side: In 1915 Eliot wrote
his cousin Eleanor Hinkley from Oxford, comparing Oxbridge student types
with Harvard ones. He told her that "two Irishmen" had "rather raised my
opinion of that race" but that the more brilliant and serious Cambridge
students reminded him of "the clever Jew undergraduate mind at Harvard;
wide but disorderly reading, intense but confused thinking, and utter
absence of background and balance and proportion."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Eliot clearly was not free of racial stereotypes, though he was
 sometimes aware of them for what they were. More interestingly he

<b></b>

held them in a way that neither deadened his sympathy for individuals
nor dissolved when his sympathy was engaged. In 1920, he wrote to
Ezra Pound that he had met Maxwell Bodenheim, then fresh from his
steerage-class journey from America. He worried about Bodenheim and his
wife (who was about to give birth), and told Pound that Bodenheim was
"not unintelligent" and that "being Semites I suppose they will survive
somehow" (<i>L</i>, 384). A month later, with a discouraged Bodenheim
about to decamp for lack of work, Eliot asks Pound compassionately
whether he can think of "means by which Bodenheim might be made
self-supporting here" but adds that the problem is that "he is in some
ways more intelligent than the native Britons and excites hostility in
that and other ways" (<i>L</i>, 389).

<p>
The point here is not simply that Eliot shared what Pound later called
the stupid suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism but that his prejudice
was part and parcel of his cultural imagination. As Jonathan Freedman
argues, for James's and Eliot's generations, Jews were key images of
modernity and ambivalently represented both the positive and negative
associations of the modern world (tolerance as well as alienation,
progress as well as materialism).
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 The Eliot who wrote to Maxwell Bodenheim that "I have got used to being
 a foreigner everywhere, and it would fatigue me to be expected to be
 anything else" felt more than a little admiration for modernity's
 "intelligent" escape from cultural limitation, but like James
 instinctively feared the materialism and relativism that lay farther
 down the line (<i>L</i>, 431). If one identified the extreme as Jewish,
 though, one remained safe as long as one could safely distinguish
 oneself as a non-Jew. Which is what many of the great turn of the
 century writers obsessively did&#8212;in their imaginative res
 even more than their critical prose and letters.

<p>
It is disingenuous, therefore, to displace the emphasis from Eliot's
notorious remark that "reasons of race and religion combine to make
any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable" from the word
race and argue, as Schuchard does, that "it is not, regardless of
its appearance, an antisemitic statement; it is an anti-freethinking
statement" . It is disingenuous because (pace his remark to Eleanor
Hinckley about Irishmen) Eliot thought in terms of race, but even
more so because "freethinking" is itself not race neutral. Mocking
"freethinking Christians" carries no sting, just as saying that Jews
"all got natural rhythm" carries no sting&#8212;it goes against the
grain of the stereotype. But change the word after freethinking from
Christian to Jew and freethinking then venomously connotes (in the less
polite formulation of Eliot's letters) an "utter absence of background
and balance and proportion," not to mention a keen instinct for the bottom
line and other things that tend to "excite" the Briton's "hostility." That
Eliot half-admired freethinking ways, in Bodenheim and others, only raised
the stakes and gave the stereotype a heavier unconscious charge. And
that much of his intellectual class shared his ambivalence rendered the
Jewish characters in his poetry relevant and powerful.

<p>
Do the Jews in "Gerontion" and "Burbank" and "Dirge" answer to the letters
I have cited above or to the fascinating remarks Eliot made and Schuchard
unearthed about Europe's refugees after the Great War? We shall have to
consider both, but first we need to read the poems themselves in their
formal complexity, which Schuchard's

<b></b>

brief does not allow him to do. In fact, the poems themselves, I believe,
support some ambiguity. There is reason to conclude, for example,
that Bleistein appears so reprehensible precisely because he is viewed
through the perspective of Burbank, who though gentile is also effete
and imperceptive.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The poem is of two minds about Bleistein and about Burbank, as it is of
 two minds about modernity. And the same might be said about "Gerontion"
 (whose "jew" squatting "on the window sill" in the ambiguities of the
 poem's syntax may metamorphose into "Christ the tiger") and even about
 "Dirge." ("A dead jew's eyes" cannot but invoke Shylock's "hath not
 a Jew eyes," though the reminiscence does more credit to Shakespeare
 than to Eliot.) Yet to leave out, as Schuchard does, some of the most
 offensive elements of the poems (in "Dirge" the "teeth, gold in gold"
 and the repulsive physicality echoed in the Lobster's "scratch scratch
 scratch") hurts rather than helps.

<p>
In his life, Eliot was no more simply a philo-Semite than he was simply
an anti-Semite. He suffered with Jews and genuinely befriended them,
and Schuchard's recovery of his correspondence with Horace Kallen cannot
but remind us of the breadth of his personal sympathy. But Eliot in his
social commentary also supported the establishment of a Church in England
that anchored Jewish second-class status. As Terry Eagleton argued in
1970, writing on "Eliot and a Common Culture," Eliot's social thought
can be affiliated with a rejection of "the liberal theory of society,
of equality of opportunity."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 And as Maud Ellmann has argued more recently, Eliot's idealization of a
 common culture is part and parcel of an irrational fear of social and
 linguistic displacement that resurfaces throughout Eliot's literary
 and cultural criticism.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
In his poetry, Eliot was no less inconsistent, but dramatized his own
ambivalence. It is that drama that in "Burbank," "Gerontion" and even
in "Dirge" can turn on a knife edge (as in a geometrical re whose
symmetries reverse as we stare at it), inviting us to share anti-Semitic
animus and then, discrediting the source of the invitation, making us
ashamed of our response. It is a dangerous game, even more so because
it is rooted in Eliot's unconscious, and it occasionally takes too many
risks. But it is not simple anti-Semitism. On the other hand, to deny
the game by arguing that Eliot was a thoroughgoing philo-Semite fails
to do justice either to Eliot or to his art.

in <i>Pound in Purgatory: From Economic Radicalism to Anti-Semitism</i>
(Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 241-42. In 1934,
Zukofsky sent Pound a particularly offensive article by the American
fascist William Dudley Pelley, with the hope that its conspiratorial
fantasies would show Pound where his irrationality might lead. Pound's
answer, though, was to write to Zukofsky that "Pelley is a stout felly,
and obv. onnerstands the murkn mind." Zukofsky, stunned, answered,
"I was just keeping you in touch. I didn't expect you to write to
him." (<i>Pound / Zukofsky</i>, 158-59).
