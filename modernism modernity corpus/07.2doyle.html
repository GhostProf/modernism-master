For modernism, the legacy of Enlightenment modernity was both necessary
and annihilating, like Virginia Woolf's Angel in the House:
without her, there would have been no Woolf and yet <I>with</I> her,
there almost was no Woolf--so strict was the Angel's discipline of
self. Just so, modernism was continually caught in a deconstructive
dilemma. It aimed to break the disciplines of Enlightenment ideology
on which it simultaneously depended, including, I will argue, a racial
narratology. Among its other paradoxical acts, modernist fiction deflated
the dream of transcendent objectivity while realizing the strangely
complementary dream of a subjectivity so pervious and sensitive that it
absorbs whole worlds in single moments. This tricky relationship to
<BR>
Enlightenment sensibility finds a parallel in modernism's relationship
to Enlightenment history: while modernism's critique of depth, "real"
history, and dimensionality as coherent conditions with a "good"
telos moved it toward an aesthetic of flattening and fragmentation,
that aesthetic entailed nonetheless a curving back, an engagement in the
history it critiqued--even a desire <I>for</I> that history. The collage
"M" in the title of this journal captures exactly this ambivalence:
a double orientation toward the rounded and the flat, history's curve
and contingency's crisscross, the weight of tradition and the flight of
transgression. Modernism wants <I>both</I> terms--the life-giving angel
and the

<B></B>

murdered angel, so to speak. And race, exactly because of its commerce
with the angels of English narrative and history, shapes modernist
fiction's very practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For in the modern West at least, race and narrative are joined at the
root, creating the stem of history that would uphold the nation-state
(to borrow William Wordsworth's trope), imaged implicitly as the angelic
white flower of sensibility.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Gertrude Stein understood this entanglement of race and narrative even
 as she used it to shock and attract her white readership by in effect
 shouting racial epithets in her stories. In the process, however,
 like other modernists Stein was teasing apart, as if it were a knotted
 rootball, the problem of race. As John Whittier-Fergusen has recently
 argued in these pages, the relation between Stein's "politics" and her
 aesthetics is too often oversimplified, given how embedded it is in a
 long and winding cultural history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Stein's work can serve to reveal the surprising ways that, indeed,
 modernism flowers perversely in the soil of modernity due to the mineral
 powers of <I>race</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My argument highlights the origin of Western racial narrative not
in imperial practices or travel narratives but rather in English
revolutionary history. To start here gives insight into the hidden
hybridity of racial discourses, their joining of revolutionary and
imperial impulses. In the wake of England's revolutionary period in the
latter half of the seventeenth century, historical, sentimental, and
"realistic" narrative gave shape to crucial self-fashioning "root" myths
for "Britain" and, in turn, "America." Stein's fiction, in particular
<I>The Making of Americans</I> and <I>Three Lives</I>, insistently
reiterates the tropes of sentiment, virtue, race, and reproduction that
infuse these racial myths and nurture subjectivity in the West--allowing
her at once to water and wilt the flower of modernity.

What is race, after all? Race is a narrative concept. Whether or not
it becomes the basis for social hierarchy or gets conred in binary
oppositions, "race" is at base the idea that characteristics are passed
from one generation to the next through time; it is the claim that
behavior in the present and future is predictable because it is based on
characteristics inherited from ancestors who lived in the past. Races
or species may evolve, as scientists have argued for a century and a
half, but to say so only reinforces the diachronic principle on which
race depends. Yet within both narrative and the notions of race as
they have developed in the West there lies a sharp tension, or paradox,
between pastness and futureness, history and progress, reproduction and
production--a tension which Stein and other modernists fully exploit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of Edward Said's early work on the novel throws light on
this tension. In <I>Beginnings</I>, Said argues that, with the
eighteenth-century rise of the novel in England, narrative in the West
may be characterized by its fictionalization of origins or "beginnings."
In other times and cultures, Said explains, narrative is most often
a retelling of authorized or familiar stories, serving to reinstate
cultural referents even as it reconres them; but, with the rise of
the novel and the idea of individuality, Western

<B></B>

narrative obsessively sought to tell <I>new</I> stories of unknown
individuals, to make a question and an "original" plot of the
protagonist's beginnings. In the process the novel recreated the story
of culture--a point that Nancy Armstrong and other critics of the novel
have more recently elaborated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet in his early essay "On Repetition," Said also recognizes a necessary
tension in Western narratives, which he identifies as a tension between
production and reproduction. He first of all compares the conservative,
stabilizing function of repetition in cultural forms (such as in laws,
rituals, and myths) to the similarly conservative role of marriage and
biological reproduction. Reproduction, like ritualization, reflects the
will to repeat, to create a new generation that will carry on the forms
and customs of the old. He furthermore suggests, without developing
the idea, that many laws and rituals operate to reproduce the norms of
heterosexual reproduction and contain its members' anarchic, nonrepetitive
impulses toward "anti-social" individuality or non-reproductive
sexuality. Said argues that modern re-writers of Western narratives of
culture, such as Vico and Marx, resist this investment in repetition
and yet remain caught in a tension between production and reproduction,
for even while they champion the virtues of production and argue for
social transformation they fall back, as Said sees it, on metaphors of
biological reproduction to imagine these innovations into being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I suggest that we can more precisely historicize Said's claims, both about
the English plot of origins and about the tension between reproduction
and innovation, when we consider this plot in relation to the emergent
racial and gender mythologies of the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. The rise of the English-language novel, with its stories of
self-generated beginnings, coincides importantly with the codification
of a new plot of origins for English culture, a racialized plot in which
sexuality and marriage are the necessary instruments of both progress
and reproduction. The conventional stories of a family's progress,
a reformed foundling, or a virtuous servant or merchant-class woman
who marries a nobleman, all support the ideological transition from a
racialized critique of Stuart monarchy and the "noble" class, to a new
racial imperialism legitimated by the idea of a democratically "noble"
English sensibility. While they are shaped by plots of new beginnings
and novel alliances--in other words, of the production of new social
arrangements--these stories also remain invested in and dependent on the
trope of reproduction, of the perpetuation and stabilization of these
social arrangements <I>through</I> reproduction, which is in fact an
implicitly racialized reproduction. To establish this point, I'll refer
to arguments I have made elsewhere about race narratives in early modern
England, specifically pre-imperial narratives involving the Anglo-Saxon
"race," which extend the work of a number of intellectual and cultural
historians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As early as the Elizabethan period, with the founding of the Society
of Antiquaries, scholars began developing the notion that pre-Norman
codes and customs formed the true "common-law" basis for English
institutions. Yet it was in seventeenth-century revolutionary England that
such ideas took root most powerfully. Dissident groups invoked a rhetoric
of the "Norman Yoke" to defend the claims of the "native" Anglo-Saxons
against the Norman monarchy. In challenging the powers of the papacy and

<B></B>

the throne, lawyers, craftsmen, and religious reformers alike built
on the growing scholarship in "Saxonism," that is, in pre-Norman,
Saxon language, laws, relics, and customs. As is well-known, Edward
Coke supported his influential "common law" interpretation of English
government and property rights with evidence from the <I>Archainomia</I>,
a recently available compendium of Anglo-Saxon laws.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 His agenda was less radical by far than that of the famous Leveller
 pamphleteer and religious radical Gerard Winstanley, but they both
 mounted arguments that would have been inconceivable without the new
 material about pre-Norman feudal law among the Anglo-Saxons. Pamphleteers
 among the Leveller and Digger movements expanded these materials into
 a counter-myth of English history. Winstanley argued in his "Law of
 Freedom" letter to Oliver Cromwell that "When the Norman power had
 conquered our forefathers, he took the free use of our English ground
 from them" and furthermore that "all Kings from his time to Charles,
 were successors of that conquest, and all laws were made to confirm
 that conquest" (22, 23).
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 No doubt this myth of Norman against Englishman gave special resonance
 to Sir Henry Holcroft's 1653 translation of Procupius' <I>History of
 the Warres of the Emperour Justinian</I>, with its proclamation that
 "No government . . . be conferr'd upon strangers in blood/but such only
 have the place, to whose race it did belong" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 As historian Trevor Colbourn puts it, such views made it possible to
 argue that in England "[l]iberty did not have to be created; it only
 needed to be restored" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 History proved, in other words, that "liberty" was the <I>natural</I>
 state of the English nation, a state that was now being recovered and
 <I>reproduced</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reconception of English identity as Gothic-Saxon and infused with an
impulse to liberty was gradually codified in a spate of eighteenth-century
histories of England by writers from David Hume to Catharine Macaulay. It
also shaped a range of linguistic and aesthetic projects, including
Samuel Johnson's <I>Dictionary</I>, in the Preface of which he proclaims
that "The whole fabric and scheme of the English language is Gothick or
Teutonick," and then argues that it has unfortunately been "deviating
towards a Gallick structure and phraseology, from which it ought to be
our endeavor to recall it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such accounts of the English language set the stage for the founding
 of an <I>English</I> literary tradition (on which foundation it would
 expand to become a <I>British</I> tradition that claimed the literature
 of Scotland and Ireland).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Thus the move toward innovation and resistance to the reigning powers
 entailed a narrative of recuperation, specifically of a kin-distinct
 lineage characterized by its native virtue and its impulse toward
 liberty. This is the generating tension that catalyzes the West's romance
 with race all the way into the twentieth century: it gives cultures
 <I>traditional</I> authority for historical <I>change</I>--including,
 ultimately and ironically, imperialistic extensions of power that
 reinstate new hierarchies of race in colonial locales from Ireland
 to America, from India to Australia to Africa. Racialized accounts of
 history are able thus to propel revolution <I>and</I> imperialism. Race
 at once revolutionizes "national" history and naturalizes "manifest"
 destiny.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This double function of the racial idea unfolds most ironically in the
American Revolution. As Trevor Colbourn, Reginald Horsman, and others
have shown, the notion

<B></B>

that "Saxons" had a special sensibility and love of liberty was
enthusiastically imported to the colonies by the radical Whig interpreters
of English history, including Thomas Jefferson who imagined the American
experiment in self-government as potentially true to the early Anglo-Saxon
legacy that King George and Parliament had betrayed. Jefferson explicitly
invoked libertarian Saxon "sentiment" as the compelling impulse of the
revolution and named the supposedly Saxon model of self-governance by
a federation of small landowners as a prototype for the new American
experiment. Thus did the Saxon myth face off against itself in the
American Revolutionary War--with revolutionaries fashioning themselves as
the true Whigs whose mission was to challenge the corrupted English Whigs
as well as the Tories--an historical irony prepared, I am suggesting,
by the hybrid impulses of race ideology in the first place. And, as they
accused the moderate English Whigs of doing, these radical American
Whigs were simultaneously reconsolidating hierarchies of power, for
they considered their Saxon will to liberty as the character trait that
distinguished them from others, specifically Africans, and justified
their power over these others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This is the typical racial turn, by which humble nature re-emerges from
 oppression to become a noble culture that deserves to rule others. Modern
 Western ideologies of race arise as narratives of revolution claiming
 recuperation which, exactly because of the double allegiance to pastness
 and futureness, natural hierarchies and cultural transformation, lend
 themselves to an apparently innocent chauvinism--or, as we move into
 the realm of culture, a nostalgic experimentalism: in other words,
 a past-seeking modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus the paradox at the heart of racialism is also the paradox at the
heart of modernism and modernity: its investment in the past is its ticket
to the future. The regular reappearance of "romantic" or
"essentialist" or "folk" racial myths among revolutionary groups emerges
in this light as a phenomenon that re-plays the conflict of interests
propelling modernity. Whether in race, gender, or class myths, whether in
rationalist thought or technology, modernity creates a naturalized "given"
to justify acts of innovative making--and re-hierarchizing. Specifically,
race lends a principle of narrativity by which the ancient culminates in
the modern: modernists from Mina Loy and William Carlos Williams to Woolf,
Faulkner, Joyce, and Stein apprehended, reworked, inflated, deflated and
in any case unavoidably engaged with this racial narratology. Accordingly
does Stein adopt the idea of "bottom nature" as catalyst for a radical
reconception of "character." Modernists, like modernity, often depend
on a myth of racial history to transcend history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this light, we can glimpse new ways in which the novel operates as a
magnetic power. Beginning in the eighteenth century, it gathers together
the dispersed and incoherent impulses of change-through-tradition and
resolves them into psychologized narratives, as Nancy Armstrong has noted
in terms of class and gender struggles. But I am emphasizing that the
novel's often epic narratives of sensibility also implicitly form the
inscape of a new epic version of history in their minute fashioning of
modern English <I>character,</I> fictional and lived. This is not only
a making-innocent of what is political, as Armstrong rightly points out,
but it is also a politics of innocence achieved through narration--through
narration of a phoenix-like rising out of the past which

<B></B>

cleanses the self for a new orientation toward the future. Herein do
the lives of non-aristocratic and common characters, so integral to
the novel's plot of origins, take on interest and <I>unfold</I> as
<I>naturally</I> "noble"--a word originally aligned with aristocratic
"noble-blooded" races but appropriated by writers portraying the
middling classes to connote a humble and exquisitely other-sensitive
sensibility. Such is the appeal of <I>Robinson Crusoe</I>, whose honest
yet apparently crude sensibility finds cultivation on the island through
a private, recognizably Protestant relationship with God, and then is
ultimately secularized into his Englishman's practice of industry and
generosity in business. The eighteenth and nineteenth century foundling
plot epitomized in <I>Tom Jones</I>--in which the disenfranchised, kinless
orphan proves to be the salt of the earth, vibrant in sensibility, and
at the same time having a hidden or usurped noble heritage--provides
a virtual allegory of the mythical fall and rise of the "Saxons." Such
novels tell the story of the innocent's return to power as if it were
a story of sentimental transformation: the history of a nation written
as the recuperation of a righteous self--a latter day pilgrim's progress.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The racialization in these narratives is sometimes quiet--embedded for
instance in references to Mr. Allworthy's Gothic-styled estate with
its native landscaping--and sometimes more structurally supported--as
in the fact that Crusoe's evolution toward a man of sensibility finds
prompting in his encounter with "Friday." It is against the background of
"savage" Friday that Crusoe's reflective and civilized identity comes
into relief (although unstably); but it is also through his supposed
acts of generosity and open-mindedness (as rendered by Defoe) towards
Friday that Crusoe comes into his own as an English type. Again here we
see race's doubleness in play, in that a character's ability to embrace
a "friend" across racial boundaries comes to signify the nature of his
superior racial identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    The chain of influences linking Samuel Richardson and his intimate
    friend and doctor George Cheyne to that proto-theorist of sensibility,
    Isaac Newton, gives a small hint of this early confluence of
    racial currents of thought and the novel of sensibility. As
    G.J. Barker-Benfield has shown, Newton's work influenced Cheyne's
    theories of sensibility, which in turn informed Richardson's vision
    of character.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In his <I>Principia</I> (1687, though not translated from Latin
 until the 1720's) and especially <I>Optics</I> (1717-1718, 2nd
 edition), Newton pioneered study of the ways our "little sensoriums"
 are manifestations of God's "boundless uniform Sensorium" via a "most
 subtle spirit" highly attuned to "Vibrations" transmitted along the
 "solid Fibres" of the optic and auditory "nerves." Yet even for Newton
 this conception differentiated Western Protestant culture from other
 cultures: Newton contrasts the divinely sensitive self to that
 of "the Heathen" whose panoply of "false Gods" "blinded" him to these
 subtle internal extensions of God. Newton thus quietly initiates a
 yoking of sensibility and ethnocentrism that strengthens with each
 passing decade. Yet meanwhile, under Newton's influence, Cheyne develops
 the idea of the "Sentient Principle" of the self whose nerves are like
 "<I>Keys</I> which, being struck on or touch'd, convey the Sound and
 Harmony to this Sentient Principle, or <I>Musician</I>"; and these
 notions find full epic fictional expression in Richardson's <I>Clarissa,</I> whose title character exquisitely embodies them. In fact I would

<B></B>

argue that the epic stature of Clarissa in the imaginations of Richardson
and his readers derives from her embodiment of an ideal type of <I>English</I> womanhood, one whose <I>natural</I>, sentient nobility both precedes
and transcends her class nobility. The ethos of sentimentality is thus
an incipient racial ethos and the novel's stories of sensibility are,
I argue, emergent racial stories even when they don't say so, even
sometimes involuntarily because of their inculcation in a deep stream
of racialized historical consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If this is true, the English-language modernists' flattening-out or
endless folding-over of the plots of "sensibility" and their experiments
with the everyday, psychological realism that had characterized the novel
has everything to do with their simultaneous explorations of sexual,
racial, class, and colonial identities. Earlier authors had, of course,
challenged sentimentality and novelistic forms in a variety of ways,
but a critical mass of authors interested in overt experiments with
these forms emerges in the early twentieth century, perhaps because
of the forces of historical change that were bringing ideologies of
race, gender, sexuality, and class to a crisis point. As Degrotte Eby
has shown in his book <I>The Road to Armageddon: The Martial Spirit
in English Popular Literature, 1870-1914</I>, the potential for,
or even inevitability of, a "war of the races" increasingly haunted the
imaginations of English citizens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 And this state of things apparently came to haunt the imaginations of
 young turn-of the century novelists. In the case of Joyce, for example,
 the epic narratives of race at first attracted and then repulsed and
 outraged but always permeated his imagination.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Although intricate intersubjective plots or bizarrely repetitive
 texts might seem far removed from the West's colonialist history and
 racial imaginary, the evidence above indicates that modernists writers'
 experiments are compelled by the very cultural myths, histories, and
 above all the <I>narrative logic</I> that had brought England and other
 Western countries to this critical point of a sexual, colonial, class,
 and in particular, racial stand-off.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gertrude Stein is among the authors most engaged with this problematic of
race, sex, identity, and narrative. Her early preoccupation with German
and perhaps Jewish immigrant res and other racialized characters
indicates both her suppressed autobiographical involvement in the question
of sensibility and her awareness of the racial structure of Anglo-American
plots. And while Stein rarely foregrounded her German-Jewish identity,
one may nonetheless understand her experimental writing as impelled
by a desire to unfix the imperatives of all such culturally narrated
identities--an idea that in effect she herself theorized in identifying
herself with the "Oriental" infiltration and disruption of western habits,
as Shawn Alfrey has suggested.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Maria Damon and Charles Bernstein have furthermore pointed out that,
 in an era when racial identities were so rigidly prescribed, such an
 impulse would seem almost unavoidable, and preferable to embracing any
 identity locked into western categories of Jew or German or white.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, however, the seductive stabilization of identity that race
offers enthralled Stein as it did so many others in this period. Stein
rushed to fix and essentialize some identities in the process of, and
almost as if it were a necessary means to, dissolving and dislocating
others--in this sense repeating the double finesse typical of racial
rhetoric

<B></B>

in the modern West. While Stein is arguably one of the most radical
innovators in early twentieth century literature, her work at the
same time contains some of the most openly racist descriptions of
characters. Especially since Sonia Saldivar-Hull's important essay
critiquing white feminists' blindness to Stein's racism, critics
interested in discussing the radicalism of Stein's experiments have
struggled to reconcile these two aspects of her fiction, sometimes
feeling forced to choose between appreciation and condemnation of this
text or that.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But to praise some of Stein's work and deem some of it racist only
obscures the ways race is more inherent to her fiction and to Western
narrative as a whole in the ways I have been sketching. As recent
work on modernism corroborates, the modernists' racializing of language,
characters, and plots is of a piece with, rather than an unfortunate
diversion from, their literary innovations. And within this complicated
project, the racist effects, if not intentions, of Stein's and others'
characterizations of blacks continue to perpetuate white discursive and
bodily violence against blacks. In this light I would like to take Sonia
Saldivar-Hull's call to critics to acknowledge this fact as a call also
to understand it: not in order to deny the problem but in order
to move <I>into</I> it, as a step toward moving ourselves historically
through it.

Throughout her career, Stein was preoccupied with the drama of
generational repetition and transgression as it got recast within
western narratives of progress. Stein enters an inherently racialized
Anglo-Saxon narrative tradition, in which economic progress, humble
"feminine" sensibility, and honest virtue are the compelling tropes,
and, in <I>The Making of Americans</I>, she reveals this tradition's
simultaneous counter-investment in conservative hierarchy and patriarchal
authority. More specifically, <I>Making</I> exposes the way this
contradiction trips up those later immigrants--including the narrator
of this novel--who aim to assimilate into this culture through their
own narratives of progress and goodness. Finally, the novel unveils the
part that "men" and "women" and the "virtuous" relations between them
play in the reproduction of this faulty progress narrative, including by
its foregrounding of a weeping heroine-narrator, betrayed and undone by
her own belief in the "bottom natures" of her characters. This tragic
epic of a "family's progress" stands as a kind of grotesque modernist
companion to Richardson's <I>Clarissa</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reading <I>Three Lives</I> in the context of Stein's project in <I>Making,</I> as I will do in the final section of this essay, does not
lessen the stories' racist effects but it points, first of all, toward
a relationship between sexuality and race in those three stories that
goes well beyond using minority characters as vehicles for writing about
"deviant" desire--the typical view of this relationship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In turn, it clarifies modernism's entanglement in modernity's racial
 and sexual narratives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein signals her awareness of the narrative tension between repetition
and progress, or pastness and futureness, immediately in the title and
the opening anecdote of <I>The Making of Americans, Being a History of
a Family's Progress</I>, her 925-page revision of

<B></B>

an early thirty-five page story by the same name (between which two
versions she wrote <I>Three Lives</I>). Here is the <I>beginning</I> of
a <I>history of progress</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Once an angry man dragged his father along the ground through his own
orchard. "Stop!"
cried the groaning man at last, "Stop! I did not drag my own father
beyond this tree." It
is hard living down the tempers we are born with. (<I>Making</I>, 1)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Immediately Stein captures the paradox of reproduction and progress
embedded in the generational drama: for the son to drag the father is
both a transgression that dishonors the father and a repetition that
emulates him. Meanwhile this narrative of progress--this dragging
"beyond" a certain point marked as the arrival point by previous
generations--is also a narrative of a family's failure, its violence:
bodily as well as psychological "dragging" is the action at the heart
of the story. The story hints that even if the son (not the daughter,
I presume) were to obey and drag no further, his obedience has already
visited the patriarch's force upon the patriarch: this reversal of power
is the price the patriarch must pay to insure reproduction of his power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In short, narratives of tradition that purport to conserve the past entail
a moment of "progress" or change when the son turns the tables on the
father; and likewise narratives of progress that purport to supercede the
past entail a "repetition" in which the son becomes the father. There is
no pure progress narrative and no true traditional narrative. It is in the
nature of narrative to repeat with a difference. It is in the nature of
culture--at least modern culture--to "make" its "being" again and again,
with something new--someone <I>other</I>--added by historical time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact Stein herself borrows and repeats this very tale, perhaps playing
off the eugenical spirit in which it was published.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 And so we enter Stein's repetitive revision of the novel--of that
 tradition of "histories" of a family's "progress" which she understands
 as an assimilation narrative whose claim to inclusion depends on
 exclusion of less-sensitive others.

Priscilla Wald has fully explored the ways Stein creates her book as
a revisionary version of the contemporary American immigrant tale,
beginning with her title echoing that of the popular immigrant-story
novel by Jacob Riis, <I>The Making of an American</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 After the opening anecdote, the narrator turns to the grandfathers who
 "came across the water" and the grandmothers who "carried these our
 fathers and mothers into the new world inside them" (<I>Making</I>,
 3). At the same time, I am emphasizing, this ethnically-shaped immigrant
 narrative gets framed within the eighteenth-century English trope of a
 "family's progress," which Stein highlights by referring to "this history
 for us of a family and its progress" three times within the first two
 pages of the novel. In bringing together the founding tropes of the
 immigrant American and the classic English novel, Stein foregrounds and
 engages the ethnic substructure of the progress narrative they have in
 common--a structure she challenges in more direct and concentrated, as
 well as more offensive, form in <I>Three Lives</I>. In this first novel,
 as in the stories of <I>Pamela</I> or <I>Pride and Prejudice</I>, "a
 family's progress" has everything to with its reclamation of the "noble"
 via the Saxon virtues of humility, honesty, liberty, and sensibility.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Throughout <I>Making</I>, Stein invokes and repeats the same Saxon
 virtues that we find in the eighteenth-century historical accounts of
 the Saxon's native character as well as in popular eighteenth-century
 novels of sentiment from Henry Fielding's <I>Tom Jones</I> to Henry
 MacKenzie's <I>The Man of Feeling</I>. She makes them the core of her
 characters' feelings in this history of "feeling" and "being," this
 "history of every man and every woman," and in effect identifies them as
 criteria for assimilation into white Protestant culture (<I>Making</I>,
 175). Grandfather Dehning, the first-generation immigrant, is introduced
 as "just a decent honest good-enough man to do ordinary work," "a decent
 well-meaning faithful good-enough ordinary man" (<I>Making</I>, 6). The
 repetition of phrases (which continue in this vein) and the omission
 of commas (especially in the early twentieth century) tend to expose
 these traits as an ideological seme, or a common unit of meaning in the
 social mythos. Because the men in the Dehning family were "generous
 decent considerate fellows, frank and honest," the daughter Julia
 Dehning assumes that all men are "good strong gentle creatures, honest
 and honorable and honoring" (<I>Making</I>, 19, 29). These qualities
 must be highlighted within the immigrant narrative, as they are again
 and again, exactly <I>against</I> accusations that immigrants did
 not fit the profile of a straightforward, upright, simple yet decent
 Anglo-Saxon Americans--of good "fellows."  The narrator hints at the
 hidden racial-national valuation at stake in these "simple" values when
 she turns in this context to the "great question . . . of washing"
 (a motif that also signifies racial identity in <I>Three Lives</I>):
 "The French tell me it's the Italians who never do any washing,
 the French and the Italian both find the Spanish a little short in
 their washing, and the East finds all the West a pig . . . . And so
 it goes"(<I>Making</I>, 16). But she assures us, repeatedly, that the
 eldest Dehning son "was not at all foreign in his washing" but on the
 contrary was a "sporty cheery well washed" young man (<I>Making</I>, 17).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"You see," the humble narrator explains helpfully, "it is just an
ordinary middle class tradition we must use to understand this family's
progress. There must be no aspiring thoughts inside us, there must be a
feeling always in us of being in a kind of way in business always honest,
there must be in a kind of ordinary way always there inside us the sense
of decent enough ways of living for us" (<I>Making</I>, 34). Though
introducing an immigrant cast of characters at a time of growing
fears about the new and large waves of immigration of "lower stocks"
(including lower stock Germans, as made clear in "The Good Anna"), the
narrator, by her use of an unspecified "us," slyly fails to distinguish
German immigrant from "regular" American values. This sleight of hand
meanwhile allows her to include herself in both of these groups. "Us"
is made quite porous. And the ironies thus proliferate insofar as,
on the one hand, these late-arriving Germans are supposedly the root
race for the Anglo-Saxons who now hold precedence in the U.S. and, on
the other hand, the untouched question of whether these Germans are
Jews or Christians leaves the reader unable to identify comfortably
in either direction. Given the centrality of "business" to <I>this</I>
difference, the mention of "a feeling always in us of being in a kind
of way in business always honest" further strains the question of
identification--all in a seemingly happy and innocent account of the
feel-ings of the Dehnings. Indeed the narrator works hard to disallow
any distance or

<B></B>

dis-identification here even as she coyly raises all of these
questions. True to sentimental practice, she implicitly insists on the
identity of all of "us" while covertly referencing divisions within this
"us."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator even boldly eschews the educated middle class habit of
dissociating themselves from the middle class economy (exactly the
phenomenon that Jane Garrity put her finger on in the Bloomsbury group
in a recent issue of this journal).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 First, she declares: "I believe in simple middle class monotonous
 tradition, in a way in honest enough business methods" . Though it
 is risky to equate Stein with her narrator or assume her audience did,
 it is reasonable to claim that in the heightened racial/ethnic atmosphere
 of the early twentieth-century both Stein and many of her readers entered
 this book with an awareness of Stein's Jewishness and her identity with
 the tale of German immigrants. This awareness, lurking just under the
 level of consciousness perhaps, would raise a question for the reader
 about how to respond: is this a Jewish narrator slapping the wrist of
 her Protestant middle class compatriots who consider it bad manners to
 talk in public of money and trade, or is this a good solid American
 expressing pure American feeling, as implied in the manipulative use
 of "us"? Ambiguously referring to her "friends," she suggests that,
 by owning up to her investment in these "business" virtues, she is more
 honest--more American--than her Protestant Anglo-Saxon reader-friends:

"We are to be democratic and aristocratic": while teasing the literate
reader, Stein pierces to the heart of Saxonism, touching directly, even
if unconsciously, on its historically conditioned yet contradictory claim
to both democratic humbleness (as the hearty  people of English soil)
and aristocratic sovereignty (as the wronged nobles of England and the
true Whigs in America).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Next she makes one of her characteristic twists, first of all turning the
righteous innocent voice on the complacent, superior reader ("yet I am
strong, and I am right, and I know it, and I say it to you") and then
identifying herself with the very assumption of superiority over the
rest of the world that these literate, perhaps non-Jewish middle-class
readers quietly cherish for themselves (the middle class "from which has
sprung . . . the very best the world can ever know, and everywhere we
always need it"). Listen to the echo between this last passage and the
1920's President of the U.S. National Institute of Immigration, whose
words simply repeat a clich&eacute; of the first decades of the twentieth
century: "We have bred more than sixty millions of the finest people

<B></B>

the world has ever seen. Today there is to surpass us, none." He goes
on to conclude that "Therefore any race we admit to our social body is
certain to be more or less inferior."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 I suggest that Stein understood perfectly that her narrator is strutting
 through a social minefield, a racial minefield, but her narrator can
 survive this dance because Stein has her mimic the moves of the elite;
 the apparently "forthright" narrative's turns and tropes conform to the
 "native" Anglo-American idea of innocence, honesty, sensibility, and
 liberty. While at first her relation to sentimental tradition remains
 implicit and sly, eventually, though still slyly, the narrator "openly"
 confesses her preoccupation with the nature of sensibility and the
 workings of sentiment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sentimental feeling preoccupies the narrator but also seems to elude
her. Apparently she manifests sentimental feeling in her intense interest
in understanding others, yet the more she repeats her desire to understand
sentimental feeling, the more the possibility seems to recede and the less
she seems to be one of "they" who feel it. She divides most sharply from
this sentimental group on the "feeling" of "certainty"--"knowing certainty
inside them"--which she stipulates as an element of sentimentality
along with "feeling, imagination, thinking, . . . and virtuous feeling
in them." She repeatedly includes certainty among other, more commonly
recognized, uplifting traits of the sentimental: "some have a sentimental
sense of the beauty and the loveliness and the truth of certain feeling
and it is so lovely and so noble and everybody is so good and so beautiful
. . .These are many ways of being sentimental" (<I>Making</I>, 450).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact her particular fascination with "certainty," and (as
we learn later) her failure to achieve it, gets dramatized in
the prose's repetitiveness.  Here as in much of her writing,
Stein institutes the principles of repetition and reproduction yet
meanwhile enacts their implosion via the inevitable temporal principle of
<I>difference</I>--thus, through, repetition, unfolding the contradictions
of sentimental narration of an organic self. Like the deconstructive
theorists who would later philosophize (perhaps partly under Stein's
belated influence) about the decentering effects of this apparently
stabilizing principle of repetition, Stein shows that repetition always
manifests a difference from one instance to the next, despite its driving
desire for a sameness organized around an anchoring original. Say a
word twice and the second time around it expresses a difference if only
because it now echoes the first saying. "Yes" is different from "yes,
yes." The second yes, while reinforcing the first, at the same time
turns against it, or puts it in question by displaying the felt need to
insist on it. Cultural or narrative repetition likewise enacts "stress"
in both senses of the word.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's narrator pushes further yet, however, to give just a hint of
a "gay" feeling under--and under cover of--this righteous, virtuous
feeling. Philip Redfern epitomizes one typical kind of "virtuous being,"
who "was to himself a man simple, sensuous, and passionate. . . from whom
chivalry demanded he should be always yielding when he himself was not
active in feeling."  And after all, he is like those others who "make
a principle to free them, from the weakness in them" (<I>Making</I>,
446). Yet key allusions suggest that his principle is a decoy for his
gay "sexual emotion," for "he was of the kind of them and perhaps Lord
Byron and Oscar Wilde were this kind of them, he was of them who become
romantic, heroic, beautiful, saintly by the weakness in them that is
there always acting" (<I>Making</I>, 445). While Stein covertly tells us
Philip could have loved men, Philip simply feels that "every one could
hold him by suggesting to him by the sensitive suggestibility in him and
this was his great weakness in him and he made of it the principle of his
living to himself in his talking, thinking, feeling" (<I>Making</I>, 445).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Stein scrutinizes here is the way the insistence on a structure
of self-truth, of identity with oneself that allows for certainty in
virtuousness, aims exactly to contain a volatile difference within
oneself. She further explains that within this dynamic "Sensitivity
turns into suspicion, cleverness, self-protection. . . . These then
all of them have it inside them that everything turns inside them
to suspicion, to cleverness, to self-protection, to sexual emotion,
to sensibility of a kind that is a thing that is called sentimental"
(<I>Making</I>, 566). If "sexual emotion" in particular compels this
posture that is called sentimental then the following joke takes on a
double valence--one that both incriminates and explains the middle class
obsession with honest decency: "There are some who have not any feeling of
virtue in them. There are not very many of them" (<I>Making</I>, 444). In
"Melanctha," "wisdom" is code for gay sexual knowledge; here "virtue" may
be the same--though layered slyly underneath  all the "normal" meanings
of virtue so that this sexual virtue is what "decent" virtue harbors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet again, although Stein thus seems to critique the sentimental
novelistic tradition, we should recall that it has been our narrator's
ambition exactly to come clean in a sentimental way and get to the
bottom of "every kind of men and every kind of women and every way any
one can think about them" (<I>Making</I>, 175). Her very pulling back of
the layers of sentimentality to expose a gay feeling is a sentimental
project: it wants a self, a self with a history that has "everything
included" (<I>Making</I>, 335). Importantly, however, and <I>perhaps</I>
intentionally, her project fails; she cannot keep each one separate
from her self and whole unto himself or herself. Instead it "gets all
mixed up to me all mixed up in each one . . . and then sometimes all
of a sudden I lose the meaning out of all of them I lose all of them"
(<I>Making</I>, 335). About halfway through the novel she laments,
"Perhaps no one ever will know the complete history of every one. This
is a sad thing" (<I>Making</I>, 453). It seems that perhaps "bottom"
nature is after all bottomless--just as repetition would seem to anchor
but in practice unhinges truth and narrative. The narrator's sentimental
dilemma reaches a climax as she approaches the last sections of her
book and broods over the complicated blending and mixtures and slippery
repetitions of each one. She confesses finally that:

Stein's narrator once more exposes herself as certain only of
uncertainty--a failed sentimental subject. And yet she weeps; she puts
herself at her reader's mercy; and so her reader is forced to make the
very move Stein has exposed as duplicitous and self-serving and, most
importantly, catalyzed by the questions of inclusion and ostracism,
a move prompted by a sentimental longing to reach across to the other
for recognition ("I tell you I cannot bear it this thing that I cannot be
realizing experiencing in each one being living") exactly in order to have
some sense of control in the world of others. Sensibility is an ambition,
in other words. It is omnivorous. And the reader is included in its feast.

<I>The Making of Americans, Being the History of a Family's Progress</I>
repeats the contradictory modern narrative of being and making, or
inheritance and innovation, that had shaped all such histories of a
family's <I>progress</I>. It meanwhile names the uncertainty principle
underlying progress's drive to <I>know</I>; and it links these to the
veiling of a non-reproductive yet compelling "sexual emotion." Through
repetition, Stein thus narrates the paradox Said had identified in the
modern novel in the West: of a progress that must reproduce itself,
that must repeat itself, that must obsessively begin again and again
to narrate itself in relation to the other, which in the end exposes
its precarious madeness, its will to a world-making self, which I am
arguing rests on a racial self-making and which, Stein reveals, entails a
smothering of gay feeling insofar as racial making requires heterosexual
reproduction. Stein repeats this exposure more searingly in <I>Three
Lives</I>, that triptych of failed assimilations and in particular of
the lesbian desire that disrupts the drive to progress, reproduction,
and assimilation. She strips narrative down to its racial-patriarchal
bones, with a vengeance.

If the narrator in <I>Making</I> simulates sentimentality and expands

aggressively anti-sentimental as they distill and parody the policing of
eroticism through codes of race and ethnicity. The narrators in <I>Three
Lives</I> insult their characters with racial and ethnic slurs. We learn
in "Gentle Lena" about one of the characters, who is explictly tagged
as German, that she was "an overgrown, slow, flabby, blonde, stupid,
fat girl" while the German family Lena (of the title) marries into is
"dirty and stingy" and "theirs was the german dirt of saving, of being
dowdy and loose and foul in your clothes so as to save them and yourself
in washing, having your hair greasy to save it in the soap and the drying,
having your clothes dirty, not in freedom, but because it was cheaper,
keeping the house close and smelly because so it cost less to get it

"Melanctha" goes further. In this story, Rose Johnson is introduced as the
"real black, tall, well built, sullen, stupid, childlike, good looking
negress" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 85). We are told she does <I>not</I> have
"the wide abandoned laughter that makes the warm broad glow of negro
sunshine," and yet she does have the "simple promiscuous unmorality of
the black people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 86). When her baby dies, perhaps
because she "just forgot it for awhile," Rose doesn't give her loss
much thought because "these things came so often in the negro world in
Bridgepoint"(<I>Three Lives</I>, 85).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These lines are calculated to offend. They are indistinguishable from
contemporary racist assumptions among many educated, established whites
about blacks and new immigrants but are pushed a step further than
"polite" white society (which Stein knew well enough) would like to
read in print or hear out loud. This polite society of established
whites is, I suggest, Stein's imagined audience. Indeed, one important
aspect of the insidious racism of the phrases in "Melanctha" is that
they are most likely written for white ears not black. It is a kind of
audience-response Africanism, wherein, as Toni Morrison clarifies in
<I>Playing in the Dark</I>, blacks serve a function rather than entering
as full human presences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Disconcertingly, though, as I will argue, their function is to echo
 the audience's racism in a way that makes readers squirm--all the while
 creating the author as author through the power of racism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's subjection of both Germans and blacks to this treatment further
suggests that her audience here is similar to that which she addresses
in <I>Making</I> in her apostrophe, "Middle class, middle class, I
know no one of my friends who will admit it." That is, these readers
admit neither, as said there, that they belong to a "sordid material"
economy nor, as implied in <I>Three Lives,</I> that they implicitly
espouse a dehumanizing racism.  She's calling her audience out of its
ideological closets. As we have seen, Stein had an ear for clich&eacute;,
for cultural trope, for what Roland Barthes called the <I>semes</I>
of social mythologies. She regularly picked up on such overdetermined
phrases and imitated the culture's repetition of them so as to pound
the meaning out of them and alert us to their inculcative power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 So Stein simultaneously echoes these phrases in order to expose her
 audience's investment in them and yet reveals her own attachment to
 them. She is empowered by her appropriations of them--she becomes an
 author exactly by this means. This is why, in at least one way, they
 deserve the name of racism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, uncomfortably, to stop here is to turn away from a problem that
is ours as well as hers no matter who we are, and it is also to refuse
the insight Stein has to offer us in her grappling with this problem. For
in these stories Stein identifies a deep link between the economies
of racism and sexism, one that depends on the interlocking structures
of repetition and heterosexual reproduction; and she repeats these
connections in part to reveal them. She is in the business, as I will
later argue the novel is in the business, of recreating and reconring
the cultural fault lines that alienate her from her readers. Yet, more
than some other novelists, she disruptively troubles the link between
narrative repetition and racialized heterosexual reproduction, exactly by
working through and exposing the racial logic and the insistent rhythm
of reproduction that together drive the master plot of Anglo-American
virtue and sensibility, a fact

<B></B>

that becomes especially clear when we read <I>Lives</I> in the light
of <I>The Making of Americans</I>. That is, not only does Stein repeat
a phrase like "the broad sunshine of Negro laughter" enough times to
throw its clich&eacute; character and racist function into relief, to
defamiliarize it, but she does so within an enforced plot of heterosexual
repetition, into which she inserts a lesbian "deviance" that disrupts
it. It is here that I believe there is an incisive critique of racialism
implicit in her modernist narrative practice--even though at the same
time she can safely reiterate racist phrasing because her position as an
educated middle class "white" gives her the luxury to "play" with racism
while her Jewish-German heritage <I>compels</I> her to undertake this
"play."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening story of <I>Three Lives</I> begins simply: "Anna led an
arduous and troubled life." Most of the next several pages describe the
small mishaps and frustrations of her dogs, closing with the narrator's
reiteration, "You see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 13).  Given the triviality of the incidents with
Anna's dogs, we are immediately invited to read these repeated phrases
ironically, or in Bakhtinian terms dialogically, rather than in the
monological way that repetition seems at first to demand. This emerges
as especially so when we realize that the key to these incidents is
sexuality--and the policing of it: despite Anna's earnest and close
supervision, one of her dogs mischievously manages to get another dog
pregnant. The repetitive lament about Anna's "arduous" life mimics Anna's
tone of voice, yet also humorously undercuts her by highlighting the
failure of repetition to reproduce sexual regularity and to contain sexual
deviance. Stein thus forces the narrative mode of repetition to fail
in its function of regularizing reproduction and sexuality, even while
at the same time maintaining the appearance of regularization through
repetition. In effect she narrates what Foucault would later theorize:
the irony of the way in which policing discourses draw attention to and
embellish the acts they purport to prohibit. After all, Anna is fixated
on the sex life of her dogs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time in this first story, repetition functions laboriously to
reproduce and contain ethnic identity as well as sexual regularity. Anna
is described as "a small spare german woman" who speaks a "queer piercing
german english" and who takes in young german girls as servants and acts
the part of "a good incessant german mother who watched and scolded"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 19). Anna's German-ness is repeatedly stressed,
and with all this stress it begins to feel like an identity under
stress. Again repetition works not to fix but to create a sense of the
need to fix what might otherwise slip away or be misread or, from Anna's
point of view, lead to behavior that would break the rules of German
womanhood. For a key aspect of Anna's Germanness is her "firm old world
sense of what was the right way for a girl to do . . . A girl was a girl
and should act like a girl, both as to giving all respect and as to what
she had to eat" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 24). But many of her troubles are
with girls or women who, like her dogs, do not do "the right way for
a girl to do" (including as to what they eat!). In a way that becomes
even more marked in "Gentle Lena," it is not just that girls are girls
and boys boys but that German girls are <I>German</I> girls and German
boys <I>German</I> boys.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proper gender identities must be properly ethnicized or racialized--and
it is these racialized gender features that get stressed in all of the
three stories. They are, in

<B></B>

significant part, the form repetition takes in the book. Narrative
repetition is yoked to ethnic or racialized repetition. The repetition
is usually taken far enough, and juxtaposed with enough dialogic effect,
not only to defamiliarize their racialized gender categories but also to
make narrative itself feel like willed repetition, determined recuperation
of a past self into a future self that will hold, an incessant naming
and naming again so as to <I>make</I> identities self-identical.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile within this insistently narrated tale of German womanhood there
erupts a lesbian romance: "The widow Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in
Anna's life" . The point is repeated at intervals throughout, in
a way that acknowledges that this is a plot that might get overlooked
or repressed: "Remember, Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna's life"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 34, 54). Gradually, however, it becomes clear that
this story of the "good" Anna's life is the story of the failure of that
romance, which ends, crucially, over a disagreement about reproduction
and mothering: this reiterative and racially circumscribed cultural
plot reasserts itself over the pressure of that "sexual emotion" that
might have derailed it. As in <I>Making</I>, Stein narrates narrative's
"coverage" of sexuality, its will to contain, to have and to hold,
sexuality by the clenched hand of racialized community and its "progress."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For it is the demand for the reproductive, insistent, "scolding" work
of mothering that comes between Anna and Mrs Lehntman. In Anna's eyes
Mrs. Lehntman is a neglectful mother, who is failing to reproduce
the ideal German girl which, as Anna sees it, burdens her with the
task of showing Mrs. Lehntman's daughter "the right way for a girl
to do." Stein's narrator follows Anna's own maddening allegiance to
this ethnicized reproductive logic by maintaining repetition as her
narrative principle and, despite the insertion of an alternative plot of
homoeroticism, destroying the romance between the two women according to
that logic. Here as in both of the other stories in <I>Three Lives</I>,
the narrator follows this racialized and heterosexual narrative logic
until it kills off all of her deviant female protagonists. A careful
reading of "Melanctha" in this light establishes that it indeed repeats
this narrative logic by which Stein critiques the tradition of sentimental
fiction in English; and that, furthermore, the story of Melanctha's
"deviant" gay sexuality is of a piece with Stein's larger critical
project, perhaps her most overt expression of it, even as it also makes
use of whites' racialized sexual stereotypes of blacks and mulattas to
realize that project.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an ironic echo of the good Anna's phrase, the female protagonist of
"Melanctha," wonders if suicide would "be really the best way for her to
do" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 89). Melanctha is acute about the logic that
Stein has just displayed for us in the preceding story. For Melanctha,
too, has a romance with another woman, Jane Harden, and for her, too, that
romance brings death. It's as if she looked sideways at the two stories
hers is sandwiched between and reads the writing on the textual wall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Anna's, Melanctha's gay relationship is partially suppressed, written
elliptically, and finally cut short and defamed by codes that designate
"the right way for a girl to do." Although as a young woman Melanctha
is at first timid about sexuality, she wanders the streets in search
of <I>something</I>. Yet "with all her courage," the narrator tells us,
"Melanctha was here a coward, and so she could not learn to understand"--

<B></B>

until she meets Jane Harden who "had had much experience [and] was not
afraid to understand" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 100, 103). Jane was "very
much attracted by Melanctha" and they begin "more to be together than
to see men" during which time Melanctha "dimly . . . began to see what
it was that she should understand" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 105, 104). With
a smirk referring not only to the way Jane upsets Melanctha because she
"would be with other people and with men and with Melanctha," the narrator
tells us "in every way she got it from Jane Harden" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
106). Although Melanctha ends this affair and takes up with a man, the
sexual desires and the heterosocial <I>consequences</I> created by it
stay with her.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Anna, Melanctha befriends and is mothered by a heterosexual woman,
Rose Johnson, who very insistently knows what is "right for a decent
colored girl always to be doing" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 208). Some version
of this phrase is repeated by Rose ten or fifteen times. "Decent conduct,"
as Rose sometimes calls it, is repeatedly yoked not only to gender but
also to racial identity. This racially and sexually defined code of the
right way for a girl to do is once more the principle of repetition in
the story. The code is what the story reproduces--echoing the means
by which "colored" culture reproduces itself through its "decent"
reproducing women.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet unlike Anna or Lena, in Melanctha Stein creates a character
who understands the way the repetitions of speech serve not to
<I>represent</I> patterns in life but rather to <I>create</I>, to force,
and to reproduce those patterns in the face of "other" impulses. In
effect, Melanctha herself voices Stein's critique of Western traditions
of representation, especially its narratives of moral sensitivity and
sexual goodness. This becomes most clear in her conversations with the
doctor Jefferson Campbell, the man with whom she has a romance and who
also stands for the insistent principle of "the right way to do."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jeff understands "just two kinds of ways of loving, one the way it is
to be good in families and the other kind of way, like animals are all
time . .  I didn't ever like that last kind of way much for any of the
colored people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 158). He is a devoted doctor and
a sentimentalist who "wanted to work so that he could understand what
troubled people, and not just to have excitements, and he believed you
ought to love your father and your mother and to be regular in all your
life, and not to be always wanting new things and excitements" (<I>Three
Lives</I>, 116-17). He also advocates the apparently simple honesty
cherished by the characters in <I>Making</I>. He believes that you should
(and that it is possible to) "always tell everything just as you meant
it. That's the only kind of life he knew or believed in, Jeff Campbell
repeated." So again we have a racialized code of family reproduction
naturalized as "regular," a code which Jeff reproduces and repeats.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That Jeff <I>repeats</I> these notions is important and Melanctha
shrewdly exposes this mode of self-reproduction, and its covert
self-protection. Melanctha responds to Jeff not just by rejecting this
"regular living" code for colored people but also by pointing to its
status as rhetoric, as prescriptive ideology rather than ingenuous
description of feelings. She highlights the gap between his repetitive
speech and his desire: "about what you was just saying, Dr. Campbell
about living regular and all that, I certainly

<B></B>

don't understand what you meant by what you was just saying. You ain't
a bit like good people Dr. Campbell, like the good people you are always
saying are just like you . . . You don't care about going to church much
yourself, and yet you always are saying you believe so much in things like
that, for people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 120, 118).  Finally she asks him
"what about Jane Harden?" whom he has cared for as a doctor and become
friends with:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . seems to me Dr. Campbell you find her to have something in her,
and you go there very often, and you talk to her much more than you do
the nice girls that stay at home with their people, the kind you say you
are really wanting . . .  you just keep on saying that it's right to be
good and you ought not to have excitements, and yet you really don't
want to do it Dr. Campbell, no more than me or Jane Harden . . . you
ain't never ashamed to be with queer folks Dr. Campbell, and you seem
to be thinking what you are doing is just like what you are saying,
and Dr. Campbell, I certainly don't just see what you mean by what
you say." (<I>Three Lives</I>, 118, 120)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Melanctha points to the nonrepresentational nature of Jeff Campbell's
repetitive "saying." She highlights the way it functions as a code which
he constructs coercively for others while using it as a decoy for his
impulses to avoid church and good girls and instead visit with queer
folks who like excitements. Jeff Campbell laughs out loud in recognition
of her insight; he listens too when she tells him he doesn't yet know
how to love--not regular-living love but "real, strong, hot love" for
"you certainly are just too scared Dr. Campbell to really feel things way
down in you." He responds that "perhaps I could learn a whole lot about
women the right way, if I had a real good teacher" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
125). And so their romance begins.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the code returns to haunt him and their sexual relationship. As their
relationship progresses, Jeff worries her with his feelings that she is
a bad hard girl and a good kind girl in one and he has trouble trusting
her. Their first crisis develops when he learns of her past affair with
Jane Harden which he at first feels is "ugly" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
144). They talk their way through this crisis and their relationship
eventually reaches a point where "with her pure, strong ways of reaching,
Melanctha would give him all the love she knew" and "Jeff took it straight
now . . . and he felt, strong, the joy of all this being, and it swelled
out full inside him, he poured it all back to her in freedom, in tender
kindness, and in joy, and in gentle brother fondling" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
154). But, apparently at the moment they start to move beyond "brother
fondling," Jeff's desire recoils. The passage is worth quoting at length:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . they were lying there and resting, with a green, bright,
light-flecked world all around them What was it that now really happened
to them? What was it that Melanctha did, that made everything get all
ugly for them? What was it that Melanctha felt then, that made Jeff
remember all the feeling he had had in him when Jane Harden told him
how    Melanctha had learned to be so very understanding? .  . . It was
all green and warm and lovely, and now Melanctha had made it all so ugly
for him. What was it Melanctha was now doing with him? What was it he
used to be thinking was the right way for him and all the colored people
to be always trying to make it right, the way they should always be

<B></B>

living? . . . All the old thinking came up very strong in him. He sort
of turned away then, and threw Melanctha from him. He never, even now,
was ever sure, he really knew what
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Melanctha was, when she was real herself, and honest. . . . Then he
really knew he could know nothing. He knew then, he never could know
what it was she really wanted with him. He knew then, he never could
know really what it was he felt inside him. (<I>Three Lives</I>, 155)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At these most unstable, uncertain moments in the relationship the words
"really" and "certainly" make an insistent, repetitive appearance,
revealing their function as a response to the stress of potential
deviation and heterosexual disorder: Jeff Campbell thinks "I certainly
did think now I really was knowing alright, what I wanted. I certainly
did really think now I was know to be trusting . . . I certainly did
think it was like that with me sure . . . And now I certainly do know
I don't know anything that's very real about her" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
157). If it's certain that Jeff didn't really know Melanctha until now,
it is just as uncertain that he really knows her now. In this kind of
prose, in other words, the stability of words like really and certainly
certainly dissolves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, as in <I>Making</I>, that principle of certainty at the heart
of sentimental culture is linked to anxiety about racial identity and
sexuality. Jeff is most concerned with Melanctha's "honesty," but it is
his own honesty that he is trying so hard to secure by his repetitive
invocation of "decent" Anglo-Saxon sexual codes. Especially in this
light, the "really"s of this passage should condition the way we read the
racist phrases that are also laced with real's and really's--such as the
description of Rose as "a real black negress" or Rose's description of
Melanctha's father as "certainly a black brute." Certainly this must
be true. And yet it is just as uncertain as all the certainly's in
Stein's stories. Stein leaves us uncertainly with the certain violence
of her racist clich&eacute;s, just as certainly as she leaves those
clich&eacute;s deformed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's method is to constrain her characters' lives within an insistent
reproductive narrative even while she uses its repetitions to expose its
violence to her characters' desires. Her narrators tyrannically mimic
the master narratives that racialize sexual codes and doom those who
deviate to social or actual death. There is catharsis in her method,
and there is clearly more going on than using black characters to
signify transgressive sexuality, but both readers and characters become
instruments and victims of her parodic narrative method. She spares
no one--and this attitude, while impelled by a will to resistance,
also mirrors the master's violence. The racist resonance in these
repeated phrases cannot be controlled in the text. They fire off in
all kinds of directions, out of any author's or reader's hands and yet
accruing power to the white author/reader (e.g., "Why did the subtle
intelligent, attractive, half white girl Melanctha, with her sweetness
and her power and her wisdom, demean herself to do for and to flatter
and to be scolded, by this lazy, stupid, ordinary, selfish black girl"
[<I>Three Lives</I>, 200]). There is a kind of pleasure in their power
to shock and wound--when the character is German the pleasure is in part
masochistic, but the meaning necessarily shifts when she as a "white"
person uses racist phrases about "black" characters. Thus it becomes
clear that, like other modernists, Stein both critiques and colludes
in the racial order of things; she too is seduced by its epic sweep,
its narrative possibilities, and especially perhaps its lacunae into
which she, like Philip Redfern, can load her secrets.

Barbara Johnson once said that if there were not "men" and "women"
there would probably be no written literature--implying that such is
the co-formation of "text" and "sexuality" via the shared principle
of difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 I am increasingly convinced the same can be said of "text" and
 "race," or at least in the English and American tradition, of the
 novel and race. This joining operates, I have argued, via the tropes
 of sentimentality, which also unfolds through dynamics of sameness and
 difference, universality and hierarchy. Pointing in this direction,
 Hegel claims in <I>The History of Philosophy</I> that what most
 distinguishes the Germanic races as superior, what most suits Germans
 to the "Idea of Freedom" and the <I>"principle</I> of Subjectivity"
 (introduced, he says, by Protestantism and extending to England), is
 their dialectical consciousness of "History" (Hegel's emphasis).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Hegel's formulation is paradigmatic of the ways that our fashioning
 of subjectivity takes its principle of narrativity from race. A
 freedom-seeking, modern race is, paradoxically, a race with a history,
 with a dialectical story to tell<B>:</B> a race with a <I>novel
 tradition</I>. Further, the novel finesses its paradoxical, dialectical
 claim on the new and the old, tradition and novelty, by way of women,
 whose fictionalized sensitivity and potentially transgressive sexuality
 motor the very narratives that enclose them and in the process reproduce
 epics of race (a feminist paradox that Myra Jehlen noted long ago and
 which I am now linking to the paradox of race).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Thus is modernity's attachment to race transgressively reproduced,
 by women and by novels.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism apprehends this telos and troubles it in such texts as
Loy's "The Anglo-Mongrel and the Rose," Woolf's <I>The Waves</I>,
Toomer's <I>Cane</I>, Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>, and in Faulkner's
oeuvre as a whole. Yet modernism desires the subjectivity that the
West's modern racial narratology has yielded. It seeks epic scope and
ancient depth. In <I>Three Lives,</I> Stein's flattening repetitions
tamper with these desires, but in the process repeat the violence of the
history they expose. Meanwhile modernism as a whole seeks repeatedly,
and perhaps admirably, for a history <I>outside of</I> race that will
sustain a history-transforming, dialectical subjectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And generations later, we are still seeking, yet race still narrates
us. We repeat again and again the story of racial boundaries transgressed
yet recuperated. In cross-racial buddy shows and movies from <I>The
Lone Ranger</I> and <I>The Mod Squad</I> to <I>Fried Green Tomatoes</I>
and <I>Nothing to Lose</I>, in twentieth-century novels from <I>To
Kill a Mockingbird</I> to <I>Midnight's Children</I> to <I>The Color
Purple</I>, our narratives at once racialize history and promise to
elude that racialization, pivoting around plots of sexual identity. They
equivocate with great success. Only when they do otherwise, when race
and modernity uncouple, shall we be so transformed that Stein reflects
nothing about ourselves. Only then will race be history--someone else's
history and not ours.

This confluence of race and sensibility is increasingly supported by

ideals operated in nineteenth-century American sentimental literature
both to transcend and reinforce racial identities. See Kenneth Warren,
