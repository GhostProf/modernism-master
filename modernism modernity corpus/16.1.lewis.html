<p>It is well-known that nearly all modern painters relied upon non-Western sources to invent and renew their paintings and themselves. It has also been well-established that such borrowings could only have taken place within a structure of Western domination and exploitation. Strangely, however, the meanings of the "imported" forms, <span style="font-style:italic;">as forms</span>, remain fairly constant, although chastened by current suspicions about power and advantage. Little attention has been paid to the manner in which such attempts to escape or overcome modernity were always betrayed specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">by</span> their "imported" sources—even when this negativity was obviously registered, or intriguingly rejected, by those involved.</p>
<p>Take the case of Byzantium in the eyes of modernists, for example. A whole formalist history of modern painting, identified for a half century with Clement Greenberg but in fact much earlier in origin, invoked Byzantium as a model of formal splendor and spiritual wholeness. In "Byzantine Parallels," published in 1958, Greenberg directly linked Byzantine art to the broad movement of modern painting and sculpture, citing Newman, Rothko, and Still as pertinent examples.1 Greenberg, however, was even then only rearticulating principles that had been established in the first years of the century, and at that crucial point the modernist most closely allied to Byzantium had been Henri Matisse, whose reverence for Byzantine art culminated in his 1911 trip to Russia:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Yesterday I saw a collection of old Russian icons. They are really great art. I am in love with their moving simplicity, which, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to me, is closer and dearer than Fra Angelico. In these icons the soul of the artists who painted them opens out like a mystical flower. And from that we ought to learn how to understand art.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">He no doubt saw formal as well as spiritual affinities, such as a shared lack of Albertian space and an abiding interest in the picture as a vessel or even generator of light. Such kinships were noted especially by critics: Roger Fry, for example, made of Byzantine art a paradigm of formalism—"we may perhaps be allowed to use Byzantium as a term generally expressive of the recovery of the <span style="font-style:italic;">objet d'art</span> from the representative side of pictorial art"—and championed Matisse in just such terms.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> So confident was Fry of the connection that he began a 1930 article on Matisse with a lengthy discussion of Byzantine art, after which he wrote, "I trust my reader will see by now that I have never once lost sight of M. Matisse."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Similarly, Matthew Prichard—Bergsonian, friend to Matisse, and dedicated Byzantinist—commonly contrasted what he called the "Byzantine-Matisse" style favorably to the "Greek-Renaissance-Academic" stance, even as collectors like Serge Shchukin and Albert Clinton Landsberg were independently comparing pictures like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of Yvonne Landsberg</span>  to Byzantine icons.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> And even in the absence of such direct links, Byzantium was always present for Matisse via his friends, such as the acclaimed American Byzantinist Thomas Whittemore (rediscoverer of the Hagia Sophia mosaics) and especially family, notably his son-in-law Georges Duthuit, a scholar of Byzantine art who in 1949 published an essay called "Matisse and Byzantine Space."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Byzantium therefore occupies a central position in the imagination of Matisse, while, conversely, Matisse assumed a dominant position in the imaginations of many prominent early-twentieth-century critics, scholars, and dealers of Byzantine art. Because this connection was articulated on both sides in terms of shared formalist and spiritual interests, it is celebratory. Its best-known art-historical account was offered by Pierre Schneider in his 1975 article "The Striped Pajama Icon." Schneider traces Byzantine formal elements in Matisse's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span>; these in turn suggest an underlying spiritual connection, so that the power of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span> is, according to Schneider, a purely religious power, despite its mundane subject matter.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> By rearticulating this formalist-spiritual ideal, his argument follows the modernist path first trod by artists and critics around 1900, which until recently stood as the canonical understanding of Matisse. Here, for instance, is Frank Stella in 1975:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I think that Matisse reaches the highest level that art can reach. He sets a kind of level or standard of achievement, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>. . . A lot of people go to abstract art, and they go away feeling hungry. With Matisse, you go away with exactly the opposite feeling. I can't imagine anyone going away hungry from Matisse.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Stella was wrong: there were many, in the early years of Matisse's artistic maturity, who were left entirely unfulfilled. Matisse studies in the last ten or fifteen years have sought to uncover these voices and their meanings, thereby complicating <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the canonical modernist account.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Might we accordingly come across less obvious—and less celebratory—ways in which Matisse and Byzantium could have been linked, and, through this, to the underside or negativity of high modernism more generally, to meanings that were present but undesirable and therefore forgotten, even repressed?</p>
<p>We begin by shifting away from the modernist paradigm put forth by the painter's partisans and listening instead to what his enemies had to say; and we begin with <span style="font-style:italic;">Joy of Life</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Le bonheur de vivre</span>, 1905–1906 [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]), not only because of its importance and fame, but also because it could have been directly influenced by Byzantine art, for in the crucial months leading up to Matisse's break with divisionism, Paul Signac, at whose side he had been painting, returned from Venice with photographs of Byzantine mosaics.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Had Matisse seen these images—a very real possibility—then it would have been Byzantium that led him out of apprenticeship, however promising, into fauvism and towards the status of modernist master.</p>
<p>Today <span style="font-style:italic;">Joy of Life</span> is well-established as the outstanding Fauve picture and as an image of Arcadian hedonism, just as Matisse is celebrated for his sensuality, so much so that when Matisse is dismissed, it is as <span style="font-style:italic;">merely</span> sensual, as a painter of nothing <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span> the joy of life. But for many of the critics at the 1906 Salon des Indepéndants, the picture was neither sensual nor accomplished but rather formally and spiritually empty, devoid of artistic presence or achievement.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Much of this criticism reads as a reaction to what was perceived as the picture's failure to offer <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>—a failure made intolerable by the painting's title and ostensible theme, by the betrayed promise of bodies in heat, of the most physical kind of pastoral pleasures: music, dancing, sunlight and seaside. Charles Morice wrote, famously: "The joy of life, that? But life is absent!"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> He complained of the picture's coldness, echoing his earlier hostility—"Cold, irretrievably cold remains the art of the virtuoso; cold and artificial"—and since coldness is associated not with life and the organic but rather death and the inorganic, it is only a short step, metaphorically speaking, to Jean Claude's lament—"It is indescribable and incomprehensible: it makes you contemplate suicide."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This lifelessness was extended, as well, from the res in the picture to the absence, or lifelessness, of the artist, whose presence, or <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>, failed to manifest in the picture, so that the art of painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> life, was betrayed as well. Morice, for example, noted that the painter had entirely failed "to demonstrate his personality."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> And here, for the sake of emphasis, is the sympathetic Julius Meier Graefe in 1915, looking back over a decade of such criticism: "I am here for you to ingest, Matisse's paintings say, but the ingesting must be made an art. With the right organs, you will suck from my tapestry all that others pull from your soul: truth, simplicity, poetry, life—yes, even life."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Even Stella's much later and seemingly offhand metaphor of hunger and its formal-spiritual satisfaction is apropos of, or, more exactly, inherited, in a victorious fashion, from this discourse.</p>
<p>As is well known, it was the joy of life rather than the horror of lifelessness that eventually carried the day, but the signs of its morbid negation remain. Take, for example, the res of <span style="font-style:italic;">Music</span> , characterized by Russian critic Yakov Tugendhold as "boy werewolves," and in particular their gaping black mouths, which Yve-Alain Bois more recently described as "a disquietingly true representation of death."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Again, take <span style="font-style:italic;">Nymph</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">and Satyr</span> (1908–1909), in which the fleeing and therefore lively nymph falls into a perfect half-circle, so that sensual intensity leads to freezing and schematization; or the obvious atavism of the central re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bathers with a Turtle</span> ; or even Bois's discussion of Matisse's oeuvre as an aesthetic of blinding, which points quite obviously beyond the gratification of vision, however sumptuous, to its cancellation in darkness and in death. The point is not to deny or overturn Matisse's vitality and originality but rather to set these again against their opposites, which, as the critics demonstrate, were there all along, but then consistently warded off by his modernist canonization.</p>

<p>We have seen already that Byzantium was invoked by Matisse's champions as a paradigm of formal and spiritual vitality, of renewed artistic <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>. By doing so, Fry and others were contesting convention, which esteemed Ingriste or impressionist modes of picture-making; these, because of their greater naturalism, were deemed to offer more life while Byzantine art was for the most part imagined as rigid, impersonal, and geometric, and therefore less living. There are exceptions (prominently Maurice Denis, or to a lesser extent Gustave Klimt), but the Byzantine revival in the later nineteenth century was more sustained in architecture and decoration; to make painting, especially re painting, in "Byzantine" fashion was to swim against academic, naturalist, and even impressionist tides. So conventional was this view of Byzantine art as insensate and inorganic that British critic and poet T. E. Hulme in fact celebrated it <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> its lifelessness.</p>
<p>Hulme traveled in the same circles as Prichard and Fry and Clive and Vanessa Bell, and there are numerous dismissals of Fry in his writings.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Like Prichard, Hulme was a devotee of Henri Bergson, whom he knew personally; Bergson wrote him a letter of recommendation, and they both attended the Fourth International Philosophical Congress in Bologna in 1911, at which Hulme was first exposed to Byzantine sites at <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Ravenna.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> While reading Worringer and championing artists like Picasso, Jacob Ep stein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Wyndham Lewis, Hulme often invoked Byzantium as a world beyond hunger or any living human appetites or pleasure at all, a mechanical and geometrical world:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[Byzantine] forms are always what can be described as stiff and lifeless. The dead form of a pyramid and the suppression of life in a Byzantine mosaic show that behind these arts there must have been an impulse, the direct opposite of that which finds satisfaction in the naturalism of Greek and Renaissance art.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">There is therefore not only a lifeless Matisse but also a lifeless Byzantium, developed in overlapping social and intellectual circles during the same years. This suggests a lifeless Byzantine-Matisse.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> That the negativity of Matisse's relationship to Byzantium went essentially unstated in fact bolsters this contention, because such an insight was hardly desired: not by Matisse's champions, who would have hardly wanted their formalist-spiritual ideal contradicted at its source, not by Matisse himself, and not by the painter's enemies, who had no need to trace his affinities and influences since to them the canvases were damning enough. Rather, lifelessness <span style="font-style:italic;">presented itself</span> as the inevitable but repressed mark of modernity upon the effort, via modernism, to reinvigorate modernist life. Escaping or overcoming modernity via a "primitivism" or imported spirituality of any kind is shown to be like trying to sail beyond the sunset; any modernist invocation of Byzantium as a spiritual refuge must always betray itself.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated not only by the proposition of a lifeless Byzantine-Matisse but also by the most famous artistic vision of Byzantium produced in any medium by a modern artist, which is W. B. Yeats's "Sailing to Byzantium" . The poem is generally interpreted as an artistic-spiritual quest for transcendence and artistic immortality by means of Byzantium, which for Yeats represented the ideal synthesis of religious, aesthetic, and practical life. In "Byzantium a little before Justinian opened St. Sophia and closed the academy of Plato," wrote Yeats, "I think I could find in some little wine-shop some philosophical worker in mosaic who could answer all my questions . . . ."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The holy city is the site of a plea for the immortality of the artist's soul. But in the final stanza, the poet is not transformed, as might be expected, into a creature of pure spirit, but rather into a mechanical bird:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Once out of nature I shall never take<br>My bodily form from any natural thing,<br>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br>Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br>To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The image, derived from the golden bird of the Byzantine emperor Theopholis, is a complicated one, as is the Byzantine myth in general for Yeats. It is remarkable, however, that the poet's quest appears unable to fulfill itself properly, or at best to fulfill itself only by conjuring a purely mechanical paradise—the traditional negation of both flesh and spirit.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> It is especially noteworthy given that Yeats, who had twice toured Byzantine sites in Italy and Sicily (including Ravenna) and expressed great admiration for Byzantine revival architecture (in particular the Stockholm town hall), had a huge stock of Byzantine imagery to draw on, as well as the enormous powers of his imagination. As if in spite of his intentions, he chose the image of a mechanical bird; or, better, we might say that the bird-machine chose him—precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> it was a machine.</p>
<p>We know from Yeats's letters that he was concerned about what he thought of as a poetic misstep, or the unintended revelation of modernity-as-mechanization. The fact that close readers took the poem's conclusion as a robotic bird, pure and simple, and could not find transcendence there caused Yeats not only to admit that the image had failed to convey his intentions but also to write a second Byzantine poem in 1930. This poem, called "Byzantium," can be read as a sustained attempt to do away with the unwanted mechanical truth that the Byzantine quest had in fact produced. It can be read, that is, as a poem about its predecessor, which it attempts to correct (but ultimately to little avail). Fittingly, it begins with a lyric about lyric, and with a firm thematic shift from day to night:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The unpurged images of day recede;<br>The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;<br>Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song<br>After great cathedral gong;<br>A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains . . . <a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Given that this poem continues and modifies "Sailing to Byzantium," it is quite plausible to read the "unpurged images of day" as a reference to the first poem, and, more specifically, to the problematic mechanical images that prompted "Byzantium." <span style="font-style:italic;">Unpurged</span> is a telling choice of word, pointing as it does towards a failure to repress fully. That the images are not purged but merely <span style="font-style:italic;">recede</span>, as if associated with a bad waking dream, suggest that the mechanical truth is an indelible stain and <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> in fact be expunged but only shunted aside, covered, complicated. Yeats associates these still unpurged—but also unpurgable—images with day, which suggests light, in which truth becomes visible; because this is undesirable, "Byzantium" moves from day into night, thereby attempting to obscure its problematic hypogram in darkness. It is therefore a nocturnal poem (in only the first five lines, quoted above, we read of soldiery "abed," of "night resonance," "night walkers," and a "starlit or moonlit" dome). But this attempt to blind the reader is not enough:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Miracle, bird or golden handiwork,<br>More miracle than bird or handiwork,<br>Planted on the starlit golden bough, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Can like the cocks of Hades crow,<br>Or, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud<br>In glory of changeless metal<br>Common bird or petal<br>And all complexities of mire or blood.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Like everything in the poem, the bird returns at night, so that it is inscribed within a thematic of non-sight—but it nevertheless returns, like anything repressed. Therefore an additional strategy of obfuscation by multiplication is employed. This is tantamount to double or triple vision—to already darkened sight placed behind a fragmented lens. Notice that the possible identities—miracle, bird, and golden handiwork in the first two lines, denizen of the underworld and rival of the non-mechanical world in lines 3 to 6—are in fact linked only with <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span>, never <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span>, so that the multiple images/identities never coalesce but instead remain permanently multiple. In fact this multiplicity is itself doubled: it is "planted" on the golden bough, its scorn is directed equally at bird "or petal," suggesting transformation into a flower or a tree (significantly, an organic rather than mechanical doubling). Because of all this, Yeats's affirmation in the stanza's second line can only be read as a choice among others, not a final or stable truth. The passage as a whole offers a protracted oscillation—we might even say <span style="font-style:italic;">vacillation</span>, which is the title of a poem published, along with "Byzantium," in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Winding Stair and Other Poems</span>—between the intransigent mechanical truth of the bird and the attempt to simultaneously conceal it in darkness and fragment its possible meanings.</p>
<p>Yeats was born in 1865, Matisse in 1869; they are of the generation that came of age with the fin de siècle terror of industrialization, a horror of the machine and the threat it represented to organic and traditional life on the one hand and spiritual and artistic life on the other. Neither Matisse nor Yeats developed a machine aesthetic, as did many of their younger peers, but their work is nevertheless haunted by the mechanical. Matisse's pastoral evocations of music and lovemaking and dance, his supposedly untrammeled hedonism of color and flesh, are in fact inflected, as we have seen, by lifelessness, as if life's affects—like painting's affects—are present somehow in the absence of actual life, as if these were <span style="font-style:italic;">mechanical</span> bodies; just as Yeats's artifice of eternity is, in the end, only a machine. Moreover, we cannot in either case tell the dancer from the dance: Matisse, whose early work was always criticized, as neoimpressionism, for employing a purely mechanical technique, was seen to have failed to assert himself as a living presence in his paintings, "failed to demonstrate personality"; and the poet, himself working through séances, during which spirits (he called them instructors) would dictate ideas and images, was in a fundamental sense reduced even before the act of writing into a mere transcribing machine.</p>
<p>Because these possibilities were forgotten in favor of tales of formal splendor and spiritual wholeness, it would take a later artist, one whose iciness and anti-humanism placed him outside the high modernist trajectory, to one day connect the dots. That artist was Andy Warhol, who famously quipped, "I want to be a machine." But Warhol also said, "I want to be Matisse," which is harder to interpret, unless we imagine that Warhol, the great artist of the mechanical and the lifeless, saw quite clearly, and applauded, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the lifeless and mechanical in Matisse. Warhol was not simply Catholic but specifically a devout <span style="font-style:italic;">Byzantine</span> Catholic: could he have found his way to this mechanical Matisse, and therefore, as we have done, to the mechanical consciousness of high modernism, precisely through Byzantium?</p>
