Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on
all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent; but those organs have
not grown on to him and they still give him much trouble at times.

In the first part of this century much modernist practice and marxist
discourse still treated the body and the machine as separate entities,
with the first often projected as a natural whole, the second as an
autonomous agent. So opposed, the two could only conjoin, ecstatically or
torturously, and technology could only be a "magnificent" extension of
the body or a "troubled" constriction of it. Even with the new machines
of speed and representation of the Second Industrial Revolution (e. g.,
automobile and airplane, radio and film), technology remained a demonic
supplement, an addition to the body that threatened a subtraction from
it. After Marshall McLuhan and Mark Seltzer I will call this paradox
of technology as extension and/or constriction of the body the double
logic of the prosthesis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Here I want to consider its role in the models of art and subjectivity
 espoused by the most technophilic of high modernists: the Futurist
 F. T. Marinetti and the Vorticist Wyndham Lewis, two competitors in
 the wartime avant-garde, two complements in machinic fantasies and
 protofascist politics alike.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P>
Today this double logic of technology is an historic limit that we gaze
back upon: the very terms "body" and "machine" seem almost archaic, and
they are no longer seen as so discrete. Yet this double logic governed
the machinic imaginary of high modernism, underwrote its utopias of the
body extended, even

<B></B>

subsumed in new technologies, as well as the dystopias of the body
reduced, even dismembered by them. In this way it also circumscribed
the modernist politics of the machine: for the most part one could
only <I>resist</I> technology in the name of a natural body or
<I>accelerate</I> it in the search of a postnatural body on its other
side. More complementary than opposite, this restrictive advocacy of
resistance or acceleration was as pronounced in modernist practice as
it was in marxist discourse of the period, and it marks a structural
limitation of both formations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P><A NAME="2" HREF="4.2foster_2.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_2b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A><A Name="1" HREF="4.2foster_1.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_1b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
After the military-industrial mass death of World War I, the first
position, resistance in the name of a natural body, became difficult to
hold. Even before the war this difficulty could be sensed in a movement
like expressionism, which, even as it insisted on a natural body, also
registered in its very distortions the impossibility of this ideal, of
its immaculate restoration. After the war, affirmations of a natural
body were mostly therapeutic or compensatory, and they did not last
long (e. g., the ambition of the early Bauhaus to reintegrate body and
object in a medievalist recovery of craft). The 1920s were dominated by
two tendencies: on the one hand, various returns to the re, often
neoclassical in nature, most of which were reaction-formations against
the mutilated bodies of World War I as well as the fragmented res
of high modernism; and, on the other hand, various machinic modernisms,
most of which

<B></B>

were also concerned to make over this body-ego image that had been
damaged in reality and representation alike (. <A HREF="4.2foster_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="4.2foster_2.html">2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 If the neoclassical reaction proffered the nostalgic balm of an imaginary
 body that was pellucidly intact, the machinic reaction looked to the
 very mechanization of the modern body for a new principle of corporal
 order. At base, however, the first reaction was no more "humanist" than
 the second: <I>both</I> tended to treat the body as if it were already
 dead, an uncanny statue in the first instance, an uncanny mechanism in
 the second--that is, <I>as if the only way for the body to survive in
 the military-industrial epoch of capitalism was for it to be already
 dead, in fact deader than dead.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
Many machinic modernisms made a fetish of technology. They treated it
apart from mode of production and turned it into an object of art:
it became a force in its own right and/or an emblem of "the modern
spirit." This aestheticist occlusion of the socioeconomic bases of
technology was not limited to the protofascist aspects of Futurism and
Vorticism. It occurred wherever a machinic style was held out as the lure
of a technological future to which people were asked, indeed compelled,
to accede.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In the capitalist West the image of the machine often distracted
 from the reality of industrialization, while in the communist East
 the representation of production often compensated for a lack of
 productivity.

<B></B>

<P>
Of course there were also critiques of technology in high modernism,
especially in dada and surrealism, but they tended to complement
the machinic celebrations. In fact the primary modernist positions
on technology pro- and con- can be schematically mapped according
to the double logic of the prosthesis. Thus, for example, Russian
constructivism mostly projected technology, in a communist system of
relations, as an <I>extension</I> of the body, and this in two ways
at least: as a transformation of physical sense (constructivism as a
"socialism of vision") and as a transcendence of bourgeois individuality
(constructivism as a collectivism of culture), all under the aegis of
the engineer, the new machinic man par excellence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The critical counterpart of this position was dada, especially
 the Cologne version of Max Ernst, which mostly mocked technology,
 set in a capitalist system of relations, as a <I>constriction</I>
 of the body. With the irony of a bashed ego, this dada red the
 new technological subject in terms of physical breakdown and psychic
 regression: in lieu of the paragon of the communist engineer, it offered
 the parody of the capitalist man-machine as infant-autist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P>
Other complements on the question of technology include the middle
Bauhaus and surrealism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Like Russian constructivism, the middle Bauhaus presented technology as
 an <I>extension</I> of the body, but in the context of a complicated
 rapprochement with capital. Thus, even as it too worked to transform
 physical sense and to subsume bourgeois individuality, it did so in a
 context that mostly abetted the capitalist rationalization of bodies
 and psyches. In this regard surrealism not only countered the middle
 Bauhaus with a presentation of technology as a <I>constriction</I> of
 the body, but also exposed this capitalist rationalization as irrational.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 However, rather than image this irrationality as a regressive
 breakdown of the body &agrave; la dada, surrealism red it, with
 broken automatons and fragmented mannequins, in terms of a castrative
 dismemberment. In doing so it disclosed the psychic underpinnings of
 the double logic of the technological prosthesis that governed the
 machinic imaginary of high modernism: the machine as a castrative
 trauma <I>and</I> as a phallic shield against such trauma. It is
 this masculinist logic that I want to trace in its most aggressive
 articulations: the early polemical writings of Marinetti and Lewis.

<P>
The desire to embrace technology, to accelerate its transformation of
bodies and psyches, is not bound to any one cultural politic. In different
ways at different times res such as Antonio Gramsci, Siegfried
Kracauer, and Walter Benjamin all advocated such an approach. Yet this
Left Fordist position cannot be conflated with the aesthetic militarism
of a Marinetti, a Lewis, or an Ernst J&uuml;nger. The fundamental
difference is between a marxist project to <I>overcome</I> technological
self-alienation dialectically (for all) and a protofascist desire to
<I>elevate</I> this self-alienation into an absolute value (for a select
few)--as a form of ego ecstasy (as Benjamin understood the technosublime
of Marinetti: self-destruction as "an aesthetic pleasure of the first
order") and/or as a form of ego armoring (as in "the new ego" proposed
by Lewis before the war, or "the second consciousness . . . outside the
sphere of pain" proposed by J&uuml;nger thereafter).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P>
Nevertheless, both positions share one thing: they too are haunted by the
specter of the damaged body of the worker-soldier. The same is true of
the interwar critique of technology in the dysfunctional male res
of dada and the dismembered female ones of surrealism. (The dadaist
res evoke this damaged body almost directly, the surrealist res
much less so--and yet might they register the displaced return of this
repressed body onto the female body, with the mutilation of the former
now projected as the castration of the latter?)
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Here, I want to focus on the wartime formulations of the new
 technological subject in Marinetti and Lewis. These fantasies not
 only predate the full formation of this subject in the late 1920s and
 early 1930s; they <I>prepare</I> it in the sense that they imagine it
 artistically and incite it politically (in this respect both men were
 at war well before the war). Marinetti works on the first part of this
 preparation: to explode the old bourgeois idea of a nontechnological
 subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Lewis plies the second part: to imagine a new ego that can withstand
 the shocks of the military-industrial, the modern-urban, and the
 mass-political, indeed that can forge these stimuli into a protective
 shield, even convert them into a hardened subject able to <I>thrive</I>
 on such shocks. As our images as infants are said to prepare our egos
 to come, so the rings of body and psyche in Marinetti and Lewis
 might be said to prepare the technological subject of the interwar
 period--and to prepare it, as with the infant images, in relation to
 the fantasy of a body in pieces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
However grounded in the damaged body of the worker-soldier, this
fantasy remains psychic, internal to the subject, in particular to
<I>masculine</I> subjects prone to fascism like Marinetti and Lewis. For
this subject the body in pieces represents the energies that it cannot
bind, that it sees as fragmentary, fluid, feminine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 With Marinetti the relation to this unbound body is often ecstatic;
 he likes to imagine his body exploded in this way. With Lewis the
 relation to this unbound body is often paranoid; he works to armor
 his body in defense. To different degrees both men were involved in
 fascist activities; here, however, I stress the implications of this
 involvement for the models of art and subjectivity espoused by them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
Suggestive in this regard is the account of fascism offered by Alice
Kaplan in <I>Reproductions of Banality.</I> Kaplan describes fascism as a
"polarity machine" whose ideological power lies in its <I>binding</I>
of such traditional opposites as Left and Right, revolutionary and
conservative, populist and elitist, modern and antimodern, technological
and primitive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 This binding is signaled in the etymology of the term: in the
 <I>fasces,</I> the rods wrapped round an ax as a symbol of power in
 Rome; in the <I>fascia,</I> the tissue that binds muscles; and in other
 cognates to do with a strapping of energies of all sorts. Apparent
 in the paranoid nature of fascist politics (especially faced with the
 threat of communist revolution), it is also active in the spectacular
 nature of fascist cultures (in its libidinal binding of masses to party
 and leader in the collapse of bourgeois political institutions). This
 binding speaks to the extreme volatility of fascism: just as binding
 is doubled by unbinding, so is the fascist will to absolute order
 countervailed by the fascist desire for sublime transgression at the
 level of individual body and body politic alike. Both Futurism and
 Vorticism exhibit this tension

<B></B>

between binding and unbinding; at the level of the subject, the
ideological function of these movements may center on the aesthetic
management of this tension.

<P>
Freud uses the terms <I>"Bindung"</I> and <I>"Entbindung"</I> to describe
the different states of instinctual energy in the human subject: bound,
submitted to control, or unbound, open to discharge. The first object of
binding is the ego, which in turn becomes the primary agent of further
binding. If the ego is breached in situations of shock, the process of
integration is threatened: thus the imperative to shield the ego or to
shore it up after its breaching. It is in relation to such shock, real and
fantasmatic, experienced and expected, that Marinetti and Lewis develop
models of art and subjectivity. But binding and unbinding not only concern
the ego understood as an energistic entity under pressure from within
and without; they also bear on the ego understood as an image, a body
image, whose inside and outside are always in doubt. For Freud the ego is
"first and foremost a bodily ego . . . a projection of a surface"; it
is founded in this projection, in an identification with this body image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Lacan pushes this account further: as the body image is other, our
 identification with it is also our alienation from it, which in turn
 produces an aggressivity, an aggressivity that is "the correlative
 tendency" of the narcissistic founding of the ego. On the one hand,
 then, the ego is constituted in armoring (a term Lacan uses in "The
 Mirror Stage") and, on the other hand, it is given over to aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
Armoring and aggression are thus in tension vis-&agrave;-vis the ego, as
are binding and unbinding vis-&agrave;-vis instinctual energy, and these
tensions are evident in the models proposed by Marinetti and Lewis. Lewis
advocates armoring: "Deadness is the first condition of art," he writes
in his first novel <I>Tarr</I> (1916-18). "The armored hide of the
hippopotamus, the shell of the tortoise, feathers and machinery. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Marinetti meanwhile "exalts aggressive action," most famously in "The
 Founding and Manifesto of Futurism" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Lewis seeks to bind ego and energy: "I resist the process of melting,"
 he writes in <I>Blasting and Bombardiering.</I> "It's myself I want to
 conserve" (<I>BB,</I> 15). Marinetti celebrates unbinding: "Art," he
 states in "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature" , "is the
 need to destroy and scatter oneself" (<I>M,</I> 89). Two points should
 be noted straightaway. First, neither Lewis nor Marinetti follows the
 Freudian formula for the proper release of instinctual energy--i. e.,
 that the subject bind stimuli in order to discharge them, <I>to be safely
 rid of them.</I> And second, for both men this tension is red in
 the machine: it attracts them not for its utilitarian and productivist
 possibilities but for its imagistic and energistic qualities--because it
 can image both the dynamism of the instincts and the armoring of the ego.

<P>
The place to begin this argument is obvious enough: the first manifesto
of Futurism, published in Paris in 1909 by the thirty-three-year-old
Marinetti. Like several origin myths in high modernism, this one is
structured as a rebirth: it opens with a small group of young men in a
claustrophobic interior in high-bourgeois Milan,

<B></B>

who, once roused to the Futurist call, burst open this metaphorical
womb. As a bursting, this rebirth is also a death ("I stretched out
on my car," Marinetti exclaims, "like a corpse on its bier" [<I>M,</I>
40]). But it is a death necessary to rebirth as a technological subject,
as the Futurists emerge as modern "centaurs," half men, half machines
("Look there, on the earth, the very first dawn" [<I>M,</I> 40]).

<P>
The blurring of birth and death in the conjoining of man and machine
is typical of Marinetti. In the first manifesto it recurs in the famous
baptism of the car crash:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I
gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black
breast of my Sudanese nurse. . . . When I came up--torn, filthy, and
stinking--from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy
deliciously pass through my heart! [<I>M,</I> 40-41]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This baptism evokes the typical moment in the legend of the hero or the
artist when a new identity is bestowed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Here the baptism is industrial, the new identity technological, but
 the metaphor of rebirth remains. In a sense this is a fantasy of
 <I>cloacal</I> rebirth (maternal ditch, muddy water) in which, along
 the lines of the symbolic slippage that Freud locates in the anal stage,
 the subject is positioned at once as feces, baby, and penis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 This cloacal fantasy serves Marinetti in several ways. At the level
 of the unconscious, it allows his man-machine conjunction to appear
 as a regression to the pre-Oedipal--that is, as a release from sexual
 difference, from any division or lack, especially nestled as he is in
 the memory of "the blessed black breast of my Sudanese nurse." Here
 the machinic fantasy of origin is doubled by a primitivist one--a
 combination frequent in high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 And this double release from lack permits the result of this conjunction,
 his new technological self, to be imagined as <I>a phallus free of
 castration,</I> a phallus, moreover, that Marinetti both creates and
 embodies (per the Freudian principle of cloacal birth: "if babies
 are born through the anus then a man can give birth just as well as
 a woman").
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Torn and filthy when plunged into the maternal ditch, he emerges whole
 and clean, a white-hot vulcanic body, perfectly phallic. This is the
 psychic reward of this technological rite of passage, and it is one he
 repeats in his writings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P><A HREF="4.2foster_3.html" NAME="3"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_3b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
Everyone knows that Futurism celebrates <I>speed.</I> But in Marinetti
speed means more than new machines of movement, more than a new
technological sensorium: it is also a psychic re, a trope of time
travel, a way to beat the clock in order to recreate the self. Thus his
plunge into the ditch is also a plunge into the past: in a sense the
car crash is a primal scene in which Marinetti not only observes his
conception but reimagines it, a family romance in which he not only
chooses his parents but becomes them. This seems an incestuous move,
"an attempted end-run around Oedipus": to become the father in order to
displace him to be with the mother.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Yet the desire at work in this episode is more delirious (Marinetti is
 father, sacrificial son, phallic child . . . ). For a moment he arrests
 this mobility in the contradictory person of the Sudanese nurse, a
 colonialist fantasy both maternal and seductive, technological and
 "primitive." But she cannot deliver the goods either, for again his
 ultimate

<B></B>

desire is not so much incestuous as it is phallic: <I>to be</I> the
phallus. Only the machine can produce the phallus for him, can produce
it <I>as him,</I> or so Marinetti imagines. And in his texts women do
drop out in favor of machines: the intercourse he desires is with cars,
planes, ships, trains--any machine of transport in which he can imagine
his body-psyche reforged phallicly (<A HREF="4.2foster_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P>
Marinetti thinks this "redoubling" in two related ways. I noted his
fantasy of self-birth, of autogenesis, but he is also obsessed with the
fantasy of "a mechanical son, the fruit of pure will" (<I>M,</I> 75).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This fantasy of technological procreation is active in other machinic
 modernisms too (Fernand L&eacute;ger is especially prone to it), and
 it is mocked as such in the impotent "bachelor machines" of dada and
 surrealism (for example, <I>Girl Born Without a Mother</I> by Francis
 Picabia [1917], or <I>Self-Constructed Small Machine</I> by Ernst
 [1919]). Yet the fantasy is most extreme in movements such as Futurism,
 which aspire to technologize nature and to naturalize technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In this

<B></B>

crossing, the human and the natural are far from reconciled; rather,
they are forced into identity as a violent technological hybrid that is
red as autonomous--autonomously creative and destructive. And often in
Marinetti the issue is a landscape, at once internal and external, that
cannot conceal the sadistic violence of its own imagining. Consider, for
example, this Futurist scene: "Multicolored billboards on the green of
the fields, iron bridges that chain the hills together, surgical trains
that pierce the blue belly of the mountains, enormous turbine pipes,
new muscles of the earth, may you be praised by the Futurist poets"
(<I>M,</I> 67-68).

<P>
Marinetti does not embrace the technological in order to usurp the
procreative, for, again, he desires not to be the mother but to be
what she is said to desire: the phallus. This desire overdetermines
not only his machinic fantasies (remember the machine is to deliver
him thus) but his misogynist outbursts as well. This misogyny is more
fundamental than either the absence of women in Futurism or its attack
on the feminine and the feminist alike. At the psychic level, Marinetti
resents women because of his desire not only to be self-born but to be
so as the phallus--which is to say, in the Lacanian formulation, as The
Woman. And this leads to the great irony of his work: his frenzied attempt
to override sexual difference is played out, hyperbolically, according
to its terms. (Lewis is even more misogynist, but in the classical way:
he resents women because they threaten him with what he is not. Marinetti
resents women <I>because they re what he wants to become.)</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
I draw this Lacanian formulation from "The Meaning of the Phallus"
, where sexual difference is defined in terms of "having" or
"being" the phallus. But, Lacan is quick to add, no one has it as such;
a signifier cannot be possessed in this way. Thus in the heterosexual
"comedy" there is with the man "an 'appearing' which gets substituted
for the 'having,'" and with the woman a masking of the lack.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In this account masculinity is no less a display than femininity is a
 masquerade; in fact the man is more fraudulent than the woman, for at
 least he is <I>supposed</I> to have the phallus, while she is under no
 such burden of pretense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 So it is that some men compensate for this lack of the phallus with a
 display of virility. And yet there is a catch here too, for according
 to Lacan this display is "feminine" as well, and so the very show of
 virility may "feminize" these men further. This conundrum is pronounced
 in the early polemical writings of Marinetti. First he desires to be
 self-born, a desire that "feminizes" him, as does his desire to become
 the phallus, also deemed a "feminine" position. Then his very show of
 virility, indeed of misogyny, may "feminize" him all the more. (Marinetti
 was often seen as histrionic, if not hysterical.) Might this conundrum
 have compounded his anxiety, heightened his desire to change his body--to
 shed it altogether in a machinic conjunction? In any case, male-female
 difference cannot be mapped directly onto human-machine difference here:
 a third term, "homo-technological" perhaps, overcodes these oppositions.

<P>
These two related fantasies--to be self-born and to become a
machine-phallus--also govern Marinetti on art and literature, which he
understands as work on signifier and subjectivity simultaneously. In
order to prepare for the new ego, the old bourgeois subject must first
be destroyed: thus his persistent attacks, both polemical and

<B></B>

poetic, on subjectivity understood as interiority (this is even more
pronounced in Lewis). "Destroy the <I>I</I> in literature," Marinetti
exclaims in "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature," "that is,
all psychology" (<I>M,</I> 87). Again and again he calls on Futurist
art and writing to make over bodies and psyches as the new technologies
seem to have done. In "Technical Manifesto" Marinetti enlists the flight
of an airplane to attack "the old shackles of logic" (<I>M,</I> 84). In
"Geometric and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical Sensibility" ,
the pitching of a ship bridge rebuffs traditional "human psychology"
(<I>M,</I> 97). And in "Tactilism" an artillery battery is said to be
the inspiration of his "tactile art" (<I>M,</I> 109). In all these ways
Marinetti poses technological shock against "the old syntax" of the
bourgeois subject, its culture, experience, and sense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P>
This attack is the crux of his poetic texts as well, especially the
words-in-freedom. Often in these works word and image fly apart: the
text is literally released into the tactility of nonsensical sounds and
energistic gestures, and the syntax of the old subject is ratively
scattered. But what of the syntax of the new subject to be constructed? In
a text on declamation  Marinetti calls on Futurists to "dehumanize"
the voice and to "metallize" the face, to render the body as anonymous
as "semaphores" and geometrical as "pistons" (<I>M,</I> 144). In
"Multiplied Man and the Reign of the Machine" from <I>War, the World's
Only Hygiene,</I> he sees this "bodily development" as a metamorphosis of
an aviator into an airplane (with the breastbone extruded "in the form
of a prow" and so on [<I>M,</I> 91]). At times Marinetti thinks this
techno-transformation in terms of "pure will" (<I>M,</I> 75), at times
in terms of the "transformational hypothesis" of Jean Lamarck (<I>M,</I>
91), according to which one generation inherits the physical attributes
evolved by the generations before it. For Marinetti, the Futurist subject
must accelerate this process, must will this evolution; only then might
he "be endowed with surprising organs: organs adapted to the needs of
a world of ceaseless shocks" (<I>M,</I> 91).

<P>
Here Marinetti almost anticipates the Freudian hypothesis, also influenced
by Lamarck, according to which an organism constructs a "protective
shield" <I>(Reizschutz)</I> out of stimuli from the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In this hypothesis, which is also suggestive in relation to Lewis, the
 shield develops as the surface of the organism hardens into inorganicity
 under the force of these stimuli--all so that the central nervous system
 at its core may live. "<I>Protection against</I> stimuli," Freud writes
 in a famous line from <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> ,
 "is an almost more important function for the living organism than
 <I>reception of</I> stimuli" (<I>BPP,</I> 21). For the human organism
 in the military-industrial epoch of capitalism, Marinetti implies, this
 process has hypertrophied: the extruded shield is now a technological
 organ that (<I>pace</I> Freud) has "grown on to him," and the stimuli
 of the world are so many shocks pure and simple. In effect modern
 technology has transformed the dialectic of shield and stimulus-shock,
 subsumed both terms in such a way that the human organism now needs
 technology as <I>both</I> shield and stimulus-shock--and needs more of
 the shield because it needs more of the stimulus-shock. The effects of
 this technobiological addiction are clear,

<B></B>

and Marinetti celebrates them. The Futurists "lust for danger" (<I>M,</I>
67). "Our nerves demand war . . . " (<I>M,</I> 46). And then, almost as an
afterthought regarding the re that represents the <I>non</I>shielded
for this subject, he adds, "Our nerves demand war and despise women."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P>
In this intimation of the dialectic of shield and stimulus-shock, might
Marinetti also intuit the greater hypothesis of <I>Beyond the Pleasure
Principle,</I> that the fundamental instinct of the organism is to return
to its prior state of inanimation, to the inorganicity of its death? There
is no doubt that Marinetti was fascinated by the breaching of the body
ego. For Freud, of course, the response to this breaching is a binding,
a binding that develops through repetition. But this repetition cannot be
controlled: it conduces to a becoming-inorganic not only of the protective
shield but of the death drive. In his double move to reify the body and
to vitalize things, "to substitute for human psychology, now exhausted,
the lyric obsession with matter" (<I>M,</I> 87), Marinetti seems to
intuit this process. More, he seems to embrace it, <I>to transvalue
the death drive as the very principle of self-preservation, indeed of
self-exaltation.</I> For Marinetti the way not only to survive but to
thrive in the military-industrial epoch of capitalism is to exacerbate
its fetishistic process of reification: on the one hand, in a Lamarckian
evolution, to extrapolate the human toward the inorganic-technological,
on the other hand to trope the inorganic-technological as the epitome
of the human; on the one hand to be already dead, on the other hand to
stake the future of "life" on technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Further, Marinetti suggests not only that the best protection against
 modern mass death is to be deader than dead, but that this reification
 must be turned into a libidinal process, that we must <I>desire</I> our
 ultimate self-alienation, our own destruction, as the most sublime of
 modern experiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
I will return to this transvaluation of the death drive with Lewis; for
a moment I want to remain with the Lamarckian transformation of man
into machine in Marinetti. In <I>Capital</I>  Marx argued that
capitalism <I>subjects</I> the industrial worker to the machine: like
the commodity, it comes to be seen as more vital than the worker, and the
worker more automatic than it. Fifty-five years later, in <I>History and
Class Consciousness</I> , Georg Luk&aacute;cs, a contemporary of
Marinetti, argued that, with the advent of Taylorist-Fordist practices,
capitalism now <I>fragments</I> this worker as well: mechanization
penetrates body and psyche alike. Marinetti reverses both these marxist
accounts. Rather than master the machine, he admonishes the worker to
be "educated" by it (<I>M,</I> 92), for <I>its</I> mastery is the only
one that now exists. And rather than resist the machine as a force of
fragmentation and reification, he urges that it be embraced as the very
re of totality and vitality, as the modern paragon of these states.

<P>
In this way Marinetti conceives technology not as a violation of body
and nature but as a means to reconre both as better than new, more
than whole. This is a fetishistic operation--to turn an agent of a trauma
into a shield against this same trauma. But as such it presents Marinetti
with a problem. In Freud the fetish is not only a "protection" against
castration; it is also a "memorial" to it: the fetish may

<B></B>

occlude recognition of castration, but it cannot erase it; sometimes
the fetish reinscribes castration in its very form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The trauma is never undone, its threat never exorcized. And so it
 is with the machine: it may re a new totality, a dynamic phallic
 body, but it cannot rectify the old fragmentation nor make good the
 originary castration of the subject. In this way the double logic of
 the prosthesis may replicate that of the fetish: the prosthesis cannot
 undo its reason for being; it may even underscore that the subject is
 defined in lack. Marinetti is caught in this bind between recognition
 of psychic castration and faith in the technological phallus, and it
 pushes him toward an extreme "solution": the only way to pass beyond
 this bind, he seems to sense, is to lose this lack, to castrate this
 castration--in short, to get rid of the body in an ecstatic embrace
 of the machine, an embrace that will either subsume the body or blow
 it to smithereens. In a way this is parallel to the paradoxical logic
 that, according to Catherine Millot, incites the male transsexual to
 undergo actual castration: in order to become the phallus, he must lose
 the penis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 So too, in order to become the technological phallus, Marinetti must
 lose the penile body. In effect Marinetti is an imaginary transsexual,
 only he seeks the phallus through the machine
<BR>
--to become one with it and/or, according to the unconscious equation
of baby and phallus, to bear "a mechanical son" through it.

<P>
This imaginary self-castration is thus no ultimate sacrifice: it is a
fantasmatic achievement of a phallic ego in a state of perfect narcissism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Yet the rub here is that this binding does not allow for unbinding, for
 discharge of energy or release of aggression. Marinetti is left to seek
 this discharge in speed, war, and art, all of which he conceives in terms
 of ecstasy, ejaculation, or, more extremely, "autotomy," the term adopted
 by Sandor Ferenzci to describe when, in the release of sexual tension
 "on behalf of the entire organism," <I>the genital organ is ejected.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Marinetti calls this discharge "hygiene," which he associates equally
 with speed, war, and art, indeed with modernity in general. Like
 Lewis, who substitutes for the trope of speed the re of the vortex,
 Marinetti looks to these three events to suspend the tensions that plague
 him, especially the tension between binding and unbinding, defense and
 discharge. Thus, in "Let's Murder the Moonshine" , Marinetti
 writes of war: "It's our only hope, our reason for living, our only
 desire!" (<I>M,</I> 45). And in <I>War, the World's Only Hygiene,</I> he
 turns the old condemnation of war as murderous whore into a celebration
 of war as furious coitus: "See the furious coitus of war, gigantic
 vulva stirred by the friction of courage, shapeless vulva that spreads
 to offer itself to the terrific spasm of final victory!" (<I>M,</I>
 53-54). Yet what really is the object of desire here? It seems
 less the "shapeless vulva" than the soldier-subject as phallus--the
 body-psyche as narcissistic-aggressive weapon, autotomic projectile,
 "body in flames, like a fireship, against the enemy" (<I>M,</I> 46).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 This is the primary object of investment for Marinetti: an image of the
 body ego at once armored and aggressive, defended and discharged, that
 finds its "only hope [and] only desire" in war.

<P>
Here the question of violence in Marinetti must be addressed. No less than
his call for destruction, his disruption of language is performative:
it prepares for actual events. Yet "preparation" must be understood in
a double sense: not only an inciting

<B></B>

of violence but a shielding from it--an inciting that is also a
shielding. This process can be seen in terms of sexuality, and I doubt it
is "merely" an analogy. The violence pronounced in Marinetti is sadistic,
yet it is also masochistic, and primarily so: after all, who explodes in
his autotomic fantasies? In several recent texts Leo Bersani has defined
sexuality in terms of such a sublime self-shattering. "We desire what
nearly shatters us," he writes. "The mystery of sexuality is that we
seek not only to get rid of this shattering tension but also to repeat
it, even to increase it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 This is close to the dynamic in Marinetti: he desires such shattering,
 desires to repeat it, but also desires to be rid of it, to discharge
 it or at least to "sublimate" it. (Again: "Art is the need to destroy
 and scatter oneself" [<I>M,</I> 89].) For Bersani, violence arises when
 this desire is arrested, when its "psychic dislocations" are denied;
 then there develops "a destructive fixation on anecdotal violence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 At some level might the rhetorical violence of Futurism, its bombastic
 glorification of aggressive art, speed, and war, serve to stop this
 stoppage of desire, to embrace the disruption created by its movement
 in defense against the destruction provoked by its arrest?
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P>
Marinetti also conceives fascism along the lines of his phallic
fantasy. In "Beyond Communism"  he argues that "Futurist fascism"
supersedes both liberalism and bolshevism as the historical force of
revolution: it purifies and protects an Italy corrupted by bourgeois
parliamentarianism and threatened by communist bureaucracy. Here the
Futurist discourse of "hygiene" is overtly political, but its paradoxical
logic remains corporal and sexual: in order to make whole one must
amputate. "We Italian Futurists have amputated all the ideologies and
everywhere imposed our new conception of life, our formulas for spiritual
health" (<I>M,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 For Marinetti it is not enough to unify Italy politically; it must be
 <I>totalized</I> ideologically, all heterogeneity effaced. And this
 totality is red in the phallic body amputated of all degenerate,
 divisive, that is, penile, elements.

<P>
In this image of the body, subject and nation are made to mirror one
another. With the trope of electricity as a nervous system, Marinetti
imagines his fellow nationals as fellow nerves: the fatherland is not only
"the greatest extension" of each but also the "single conration" that
"ties [them all] together" (<I>M,</I> 149). Technological apparatuses
that bind masses to party and leader replace political institutions
that once mediated subject and nation. "All that," Marinetti writes,
"in the great affectionate solidarity of our race on our peninsula
within the firm circle of boundaries conquered and deserved by our
great victory" (<I>M,</I> 153). Not only racial and ideological, this
binding is libidinal and imagistic: in the fascist peninsula the subject
is invited to find physical "boundaries," erotic "solidarity," phallic
"victory." And this totality, Marinetti warns, is not to be had otherwise:
"To deny the fatherland is the same as to isolate, castrate, shrink,
denigrate, or kill yourself" (<I>M,</I> 149).

<P><A NAME="4" HREF="4.2foster_4.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_4b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
In this way the aesthetic of the phallus is also a politics of the
fatherland in which the Italian peninsula is invoked as a libidinal image
for a new collective ego. But here, too, the image may be flawed, as the
etymology of the term "peninsula" suggests: <I>paene insula,</I> nearly
an island, nearly severed. This penis(ula) dangles dangerously

<B></B>

below the body of Europe, and Marinetti feels compelled to project it,
to phallicize it, to extend Italy to its linguistic limits, to recapture
its whole native body. In one words-in-freedom titled <I>Irredentismo</I>
Marinetti shows the peninsula thrust north and east into Austria with
Futurist lines, battle cries, and patron names (e. g., Mazzini): an
Italy in dissemination (<A HREF="4.2foster_4.html"> 4</A>). And yet a tension remains between the
demand for "the firm circle of boundaries," individual and national, and
a desire to exceed them. This tension is another instance of the double
logic of order and transgression, defense and discharge, armoring and
exploding, so pronounced in Marinetti, indeed in fascism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Here, too, war is the primary "resolution," psychic and political, that
 occurs to him: "war, the world's only hygiene."

<P>
But who is to mold the "flaccid human masses" into this "higher
spiritual elegance" (<I>M,</I> 154) of the fascist fatherland? For
Marinetti the answer is obvious: "We will have a race almost entirely
composed of artists" (<I>M,</I> 156). This race is the fatherland; "the
fatherland is nothing but a vast party" (<I>M,</I> 149); and the party
"will solve the social problem artistically" (<I>M,</I> 156). This
crossing of aesthetics and politics, of artistic purity and social
"hygiene," is ominous, especially when the language of spirituality is
also crossed with the technology of spectacle. And yet the party alone
is not adequate as a libidinal object to mold the flaccid masses (even
fascist trappings need a body to hang on). This role must be assumed by
the leader, as Marinetti implies in "Portrait of Mussolini" .

<P>
In this celebration Marinetti identifies Mussolini with Italy directly,
physically, "because physically he is built <I>all'italiana</I>"
(<I>M,</I> 158). "Carved out of the mighty rocks of our peninsula," his
"great gesture-fist-image-conviction" embodies "the cubic will of the
state" (<I>M,</I> 159). Of course Mussolini collaborated on this portrait
with a complete repertoire of phallic poses and dynamic expressions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Turgid torso, shaved head, a body like a "projectile": if Italy is a
 penis(ula), Mussolini is its (dick)head. And it is through this fetish
 of the body of the leader that the binding of individual to

<B></B>

party and fatherland is clinched. "A marvelous Futurist temperament,"
Mussolini is here made a marvelous Futurist art work as well.

In "Some Reflections on the Ego," a short text of 1953, Lacan writes
of <I>"Homo psychologicus"</I> as "the product of our industrial age,"
possessed of a strange intimacy with the machine. "It is almost as if
the two were actually conjoined," Lacan remarks. "Its mechanical defects
and breakdowns often parallel his neurotic symptoms. Its emotional
significance for him comes from the fact that it exteriorizes the
protective shell of his ego as well as the failure of his virility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In Marinetti, virility is indeed assisted by a fantasmatic prosthesis of
 man and machine "conjoined," and yet the charade of phallic possession is
 doomed to failure, to "defects and breakdowns," especially volatile ones
 in his case. I want to turn now to the other aspect of this fantasmatic
 prosthesis, its use as "the protective shell" of the ego, as manifested
 in the early work of Wyndham Lewis. And here one may come to wonder,
 as Lacan did in general, whether it is "psychologically advantageous
 to have a strong ego."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P>
Like Marinetti, Lewis sketches the new ego in his earliest manifestos. The
inaugural issue of <I>Blast</I>  opens with a series of "blasts" and
"blesses," the first of which is typical: "BLAST First (from politeness)
ENGLAND / Curse its climate for its sins and infections / Dismal symbol,
set round our bodies, of effeminate lout within . . ." (<I>B,</I>
11). Several pages later Lewis opposes to this blasted England the
blessed image of an "industrial island machine, pyramidal workshop"
(<I>B,</I> 23-24). Like the Italian penisula for Marinetti, this
bounded British island, disciplined like a machine, hierarchical like a
workshop, is an ideal re for Lewis of a new collective ego. As in
Marinetti, nation and subject mirror one another in a body image, and
Lewis demands a hardening of the "effeminate lout within" each. In the
nation the lout is the masses; in the subject it is the unconscious,
the drives, sexuality. Each is feared as "feminine," a force of flux, a
threat to the masculinist stability of country and ego alike--a threat
that stems from the commutability of the two louts, of "the outside"
and "the inside." But whether the lout is the masses introjected or the
unconscious projected, it must be "hardened" in nation and subject alike.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 "Bless this hysterical wall," Lewis writes in <I>Blast</I>, "built round
 the ego" (<I>B,</I> 26). "Anything but yourself is dirt" (<I>B,</I> 70).

Like Marinetti, Lewis calls on artists to mold this flaccid feminine
modernity into an armored masculine modernism. For these cultural
"Caliphs" "a course of egotistic hardening . . . is required" (<I>B,</I>
134). Yet this hardening is only one part of the project; the other is
the blasting that Lewis performs with satiric abandon. Aesthetic and
political, these processes of discharge and defense are also psychic:
if Marinetti stresses the unbinding of energy and the blasting of
the subject, Lewis stresses the binding and the hardening. And this
difference informs the difference between the two movements: in image
and form Futurism favors the explosive, while Vorticism focuses on the
fixed. Thus Futurist motifs of the burst of energy and the gesture

<B></B>

forced free of the body, and Futurist lines as lines of force and traces
of speed, are both pledged to redefine form and to interpenetrate objects
temporally (<A HREF="4.2foster_5.html"> 5</A>). The Vorticist versions tend to the opposite--to
define form and to separate objects spatially (<A HREF="4.2foster_6.html"> 6</A>). "I hate the
movement that blurs lines," Lewis often remarked (once directly to
Marinetti [<I>BB,</I> 35]).

<P>
In fact Lewis opposes all such blurrings, whether associated with crowds
or women, the Freudian unconscious or the Bergsonian <I>dur&eacute;e</I>
(<I>Time and Western Man</I> [1927] is a long diatribe against
the temporal obsessions of modernist culture). This <I>fear</I>
of interpenetration is fundamental to his aesthetics, philosophy,
and politics, just as the <I>desire</I> for the same is basic to
Marinetti. And for both men the stake of these forms and phenomena is
the subject: while Marinetti strives for an ecstatic release of the body
ego, Lewis struggles to keep it intact and hard.

<P>
Faced with the tension between discharge and defense, the early Marinetti
seeks a momentary resolution in <I>speed,</I> while the early Lewis
pursues it in a related ideal, <I>the vortex.</I> "At the heart of the
whirlpool is a great silent place where all energy is concentrated," he
states. "And there, at the point of concentration, is the Vorticist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This vortex is more than an image; at its "maximum point of energy
 when stillest," it is an apparatus that elicits and channels libidinal
 energies (<I>B,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 For Lewis it res not only the tension between discharge and defense,
 blasting and hardening, but also the binding of stimulus-shock into
 protective shield, the conversion of energy into ego. In a sense it is
 a metaphor-machine of this conversion, as Ezra Pound suggests: "The
 vortex is the point of maximum energy. It represents, in mechanics,
 the greatest efficiency" (<I>B,</I> 153).

<P>
Lewis invests in such res of hardening because of his great fear,
before and after the war, of "nondifferentiation." This is the gist of
his antihumanism: he assumes

<B></B>

a separation not only from the divine and the natural but <I>from the
human.</I> More, he celebrates this separation, militates for culture to
reinforce it at all costs. Here again self-alienation is troped not only
as the preservation of the self but also as its supreme value. In <I>The
Art of Being Ruled,</I> Lewis attacks all forces of nondifferentiation,
especially the "sex transformation" in postwar society that feminizes men
and masculinizes women (the dreaded epitome of this nondifferentiation
is "male inversion"). Lewis condemns modernist art too as "a thirst to
sexually invade everything--to violate any intimity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In <I>Time and Western Man</I> this attack on nondifferentiation turns
 philosophical. Here the great enemy of the armored ego is the Bergsonian
 flux, the obsession with the temporal and the psychological. For Lewis
 this modernist engulfment in time erodes the subject, but so does the
 modernist diffusion of space; the new ego and the fierce abstraction
 of Vorticism are arrayed against both invasions.

<P>
As Lewis rejects the flux thought by Bergson, he embraces the stasis
proposed by the art historian Wilhelm Worringer in <I>Abstraction and
Empathy</I> <I>(Abstraktion und Einf&uuml;hlung</I> [1907]). This
"psychology of style" was introduced into Vorticist circles by
T. E. Hulme, but it is a primary for Lewis as well. Worringer combines two
notions--empathy <I>(Einf&uuml;hlung)</I> derived from the psychologist
Theodor Lipps, and artistic volition <I>(Kunstwollen)</I> derived from
the art historian Alois Reigl--in order to relate artistic styles to
"psychic states."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Across history and culture, Worringer argues, there are two stylistic
 poles in art, naturalism and abstraction, that express two opposite
 relations to the world, an empathic engagement and a shocked withdrawal:

<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Whereas the precondition for the urge to empathy is a happy pantheistic
relationship of confidence between man and the phenomena of the external
world, the urge to abstraction is the outcome of a great inner unrest
inspired in man by the phenomena of the outside world. . . . We might
describe this state as an immense spiritual dread of space. [<I>AE,</I>
15]
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
"Dominated by an immense need for tranquility," the primitive turned to
abstraction (<I>AE,</I> 16). Worringer sees a similar turn, also driven by
"inner unrest" and "spatial dread," in the modern: "slipped down from the
pride of knowledge, man is now just as lost and helpless" (<I>AE,</I>
18). As a consequence the modern artist also struggles to arrest and
separate, to abstract and preserve--an account quite different from the
usual celebrations of the mastery of the abstract artist, whether claimed
in terms technical or formal, historical or spiritual. Worringer undercuts
the proud humanism of all such readings. Like Marinetti and Lewis, he is
pushed toward the paradox that the very "impulse to self-preservation"
(<I>AE,</I> 35) has driven the modern toward the abstract and the
inorganic.

<P>
Lewis came to Worringer through Hulme. In January 1914, six months before
the first issue of <I>Blast,</I> Hulme delivered a lecture titled "Modern
Art and its Philosophy" that adapts <I>Abstraction and Empathy</I> toward
an advocacy of Vorticist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 He divides modern styles into two categories, geometric and organic,
 which answer to opposite "necessities of the mind" and "attitudes
 towards the world" (<I>S,</I> 77-78). Organic styles, naturalist
 and empathic, express the humanist attitude dominant in art from the
 Renaissance through romanticism: a "flat and insipid optimism" (<I>S,</I>
 80) that places man at the center of nature. Thus for Hulme the return
 of geometric styles in modern art signals the return of the opposite
 attitude: "a feeling of separation in the face of outside nature"
 (<I>S,</I> 85). Like Lewis, Hulme celebrates this "original sin"; he
 too embraces it as an ultimate value.

<P>
Yet a problem arises in the Vorticist adaptation of Worringer: a
too-close association of the modern and "the primitive." Like Worringer
and Riegl, Hulme subscribes to a cultural evolutionism that is racialist
at base; here, for example, he cites Riegl: "In our scale of values,
[the geometric] occupies the lowest position" (<I>S,</I> 17).
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Under this bias Hulme must qualify the return of this style in modern
 art. First, he argues that "the necessary presupposition" of abstraction
 is not "a condition of fear" but of "separation between man and nature"
 (<I>S,</I> 87). Second, he insists that Vorticist abstraction is modeled
 not on primitive art but on machinic "organisation," which is to say
 machinic <I>de</I>organicization, as this comment on Lewis suggests:
 "It is obvious that [his] only interest in the human body was in a few
 abstract mechanical relations perceived in it, the arm as lever and so
 on" (<I>S,</I> 106).

<P>
"What he said should be done, I <I>did</I>" (<I>BB,</I> 100), Lewis once
remarked of Hulme. But, again, it is Worringer who set the aesthetic
terms for both men, and both often echoed his enthusiasm for abstraction,
Assyrian, Egyptian, Byzantine, and so on. Already in an early text in
<I>Blast</I> Lewis reveals his ambition to adapt Worringer to a modern
conception of art and subjectivity. Titled "The New Egos," it reads as
a Worringerian

<B></B>

parable of two complementary res, "a civilized savage" and a "modern
town-dweller" (<I>B,</I> 141).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Neither is "secure": the first lives in a "vagueness of space," the
 second amid crowds that "overlap, intersect, and are Siamese to any
 extent" (<I>B,</I> 141). Yet the savage has developed an art to quell
 his insecurity, an art of the re abstracted to a "simple black
 human bullet," whereas the modern only senses that "the old form of
 egotism is no longer fit for such conditions as now prevail, [that]
 the isolated human re of most ancient Art is an anachronism,
 [that] the actual human body becomes of less importance every day"
 (<I>B,</I> 141). There follows this Worringerian credo: "All clean,
 clear cut emotions depend on the element of strangeness, and surprise
 and primitive detachment. Dehumanization is the chief diagnostic of the
 Modern World" (<I>B,</I> 141). The chief diagnostic, it is also the chief
 remedy for Lewis: if the modern is to survive its own dehumanization,
 it must dehumanize further; it must take "strangeness, surprise, and
 primitive detachment" to the limit.

Lewis does not forego the human re. Even in his nonobjective works he
often abstracts from its gestures, as if to convert the re into its
own force field. Sometimes his abstraction <I>is</I> this conversion of
a re into a protective shield, "a simple human bullet." Yet usually
he is not content to show the mere result of this armoring; rather, he
evokes its struggle and its stake. Especially in the "designs" of the
early 1910s a great tension exists between re and surround, as if
the body ego, never secure, were caught between definition, about to
break free as an autonomous subject, and dispersal, about to be invaded
schizophrenically by space.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 In a typical suite based on <I>Timon of Athens</I> , the
 Shakespearean misanthrope is suspended between definition and dispersal
 in this way: as he struggles toward autonomy he becomes all the more
 imbricated in space (<A HREF="4.2foster_7.html"> 7</A>).

This tension is difficult to maintain, and especially in the early designs
Lewis stresses the binding of the body image. Sometimes this hardening
seems to come from without, outside in, as in <I>The Vorticist</I>
, in which the body is abstracted as if by the stimulus-shock of
the world (<A HREF="4.2foster_8.html"> 8</A>). Sometimes this hardening seems to come from within,
inside out, as in <I>Vorticist Design</I> (ca. 1914), in which the body
is abstracted as if by its internal drives (<A HREF="4.2foster_9.html"> 9</A>). In one concentrated
re, <I>The Enemy of the Stars</I> , these two hardenings
converge (<A HREF="4.2foster_0.html"> 10</A>). On the one hand,
with a head like a receiver, the re appears reified from without,
its skin turned into a shield; on the other hand, stripped of organs and
arms, it appears reified from within, its ossature turned into "a few
abstract mechanical relations." (In either case it looks the part of an
"enemy of the stars," resistant to all influence.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 After the war this hardening becomes all or nothing: in a near-literal
 return to the inorganic, some res of the 1920s appear petrified
 (this is true of many portraits as well), while others appear excoriated
 (in one drawing Lewis imagines the crucifixion as an excoriation, Christ
 flayed by space). Finally, in a few works of this period excoriation and
 petrification appear combined, as if the body were suddenly fossilized,
 then totemized.

<P>
In many res Lewis registers dread or shock, but only to turn dread
into aggression, shock into protection--as if to convert any breaching
into an armoring that both shields and aggresses. This elaboration of
Worringer on abstraction toward Freud on the protective shield and the
death drive seems programmatic, yet the most relevant works predate
<I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> (published in 1920, translated
into English in 1922), and his remarks on Freud thereafter are scant and
negative. Might Lewis have intimated this becoming-inorganic--of both the
protective shield that binds the body ego against stimulus-shock and the
death drive that releases the organism from all such tension--through
<I>Abstraction and Empathy?</I> There is no explicit evidence, but
Worringer does think abstraction in terms of such a drive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

<P>
In <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> Freud formulates the death
drive in a famous passage: "If we are to take it as a truth that knows no
exception that everything living dies for <I>internal</I> reasons--becomes
inorganic once again--then we shall be compelled to say that 'the aim
of all life is death' and, looking backwards, that 'inanimate things
existed before living ones'" (<I>BPP,</I> 32). Thirteen years prior to
this statement, Worringer referred the <I>Kunstwollen</I> of abstraction
to a similar "morphological law"



that "still echoes like a dim memory in our human organism." And here he
conceives abstraction as a mimesis of this primal state of inorganicity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A convinced evolutionist might . . . seek [geometrical form] in
the ultimate affinity between the morphological laws of organic and
inorganic nature. He would then erect the ideal postulate that the
morphological law of inorganic nature still echoes like a dim memory
in our human organism. He would then perhaps also assert further that
every differentiation of organised matter, every development of its most
primitive form, is accompanied by a tension, by a longing to revert to
this most primitive form. . . . Thus, in the contemplation of abstract
regularity man would be, as it were, delivered from this tension and at
rest from his differentiation in the enjoyment of his simplest formula,
of his ultimate morphological law. [<I>AE,</I> 35-36]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Lewis does intimate this formulation, he does so in a paradoxical
way that inverts it, for he seeks to find in this <I>prehistory</I>
of a radical <I>non</I>differentiation a <I>posthistory</I>
that promises an absolute differentiation. That is to say, Lewis
seeks to turn this "ultimate morphological law" into a principle of
transcendental self-affirmation. Along the way the (masochistic) drive
to self-destruction at its core may also be turned into the (sadistic)
drive to master others--a drive abundantly manifest in Lewis the artist,
impresario, and man.

<P>
In his writings Lewis approaches the notions of the protective shield and
the death drive in several ways. First, he espouses a "primordialism"
more radical than any primitivism. "The artist goes back to the fish,"
he writes in <I>The Caliph's Design, </I> "to strike the fundamental
slime of creation" (<I>CD,</I> 65).
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In "The Physiognomy of Our Time," also in this first collection of
 art essays, Lewis describes this condition as "Futuristic," as if the
 primordial were not only in our deepest past but in our modernist future
 as well. This intuition of a death drive as a process, even a goal within
 modernity has two ramifications. First, for Lewis as for Marinetti the
 old opposition of animate and inanimate is long since undone. On the
 one hand, Lewis writes in "The Physiognomy of Our Time," "every living
 form is a miraculous mechanism"; on the other hand, in a world become
 "inorganic" the machine has become an "organism" of its own (<I>CD,</I>
 77-78). Latent in the order of things ("the seagull is not far
 removed from the hydroplane" [<I>CD,</I> 73]), this mechanicity must now
 be articulated by the artist; in Worringerian fashion he must wrest this
 order out of chaos ("all our efforts indicate a desire . . . to order,
 regulate, disinfect and stabilise our life" [<I>CD,</I> 73-74]).

<P>
Second, with the organic and the inorganic thus forced into an identity
that is at once primordial and Futuristic, Lewis can present his
model of art in terms of a necessary evolution, even a biogenetic law:
"The creation of a work of art is an act of the same description as the
evolution of wings on the sides of a fish, the feathering of its fins; or
the invention of a weapon within the body of a hymenopter [e. g., an ant,
wasp, or bee] to enable it to meet the terrible needs of life" (<I>CD,</I>
65). This formulation suggests two further transvaluations. First, a
troping of Worringer on abstraction in which "primitive" dread before
nature becomes modern empathy with a second

<B></B>

nature, the machinic world ("we want to enjoy our consciousness, but to
enjoy it in all forms of life" [<I>CD,</I> 77]). Second, a troping of
Freud on the protective shield, the development of which art is not only
to recapitulate but, in an embrace of the machine, to accelerate--in order
"to meet the terrible needs of life."

<P>
Lewis also approaches the Freud of <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> in
his concern with ectogenesis, or the process by which an organism extrudes
structures from its own surface. "The central nervous system originates
from the ectoderm," Freud writes of the protective shield. "The grey
matter of the cortex remains a derivative of the primitive superficial
layer of the organism." Under "the ceaseless impact of external stimuli,"
this ectoderm is "baked" into an inorganic "crust," which screens stimuli
for the layers beneath (<I>BPP,</I> 20-21). Compare Lewis in <I>The
Art of Being Ruled:</I> "We are <I>surface creatures</I>. . . . There
is no meaning except on the surface. It is physiologically the latest,
the ectodermic, and the most <I>exterior</I> material of our body that
is responsible for our intellectual life: it is on the faculty for
exteriorization that our life depends." (<I>WLA,</I> 210) In effect
Lewis adopts the Freudian metaphor of baking as a model for art and
subjectivity alike, but with two revisions: he reverses the process
(both must be baked inside out); and he insists that the baking be total,
the crust complete. For Lewis the internal layers that Freud wants to
protect are so much "jellyfish."

<P>
Even in his early writings--like the novel <I>Tarr</I>, the essays in
<I>The Caliph's Design,</I> or the short stories in <I>The Wild Body</I>
--Lewis takes this deadness as his ideal. Its most radical
formulation is presented by the eponymous protagonist of <I>Tarr:</I>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Deadness is the first condition of art. The armoured hide of the
hippopotamus, the shell of the tortoise, feathers and machinery, you
may put in one camp; naked pulsing and moving of the soft inside of
life--along with elasticity of movement and consciousness--that goes in
the opposite camp. Deadness is the first condition of art: the second is
absence of soul, in the human and sentimental sense. With the statue its
lines and masses are its soul, no restless inflammable ego is imagined
for its interior: it has <I>no inside:</I> good art must have no inside:
that is capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Already in play here in 1914 are all the leitmotifs of later Lewis: the
attack on psychological interiority as "naked pulsing"; the celebration of
the uncanny deadness of the armored, the machinic, even the neoclassical
(the statue); above all, the transformation of stimulus-shock into shield
(hide, shell, feathers, machinery).

<P><A HREF="4.2foster_2.html" NAME="2"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_2b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A><A HREF="4.2foster_1.html" NAME="1"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_1b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
In part this celebration of deadness is cynical bravado, and it is
not often borne out by the work: Lewis may detest the naked pulsing
of life, but his res are not baked through. The early designs in
particular capture the tense ambiguity between inside and outside,
animate and inanimate, breaching and shielding that traumatic shock
puts into play. Aggression also enlivens the deadness otherwise prized
by Lewis. Consider his depiction of eyes: in Freud these organs are
"feelers . . . left behind on the surface" (<I>BPP,</I> 21); in Lewis
they are opaque objects, barred windows to no soul. Yet they are far
from dead: like the grins of his Tyros, the "elementals"

<B></B>

conjured up in the 1920s, the eyes for Lewis are forces of aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Even in more realistic portraits they appear as shields-cum-weapons,
 the point at which the body ego is most hardened, most cruel (. <A HREF="4.2foster_1.html">11</A>
 and <A HREF="4.2foster_2.html">12</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P>
This aggression is also apparent in his commitment to satire, which
follows from his "externalist" approach. "There is a stiffening of Satire
in everything good, of 'the grotesque,' which is the same thing," Lewis
writes in his "Theory of the External, the Classical, Approach in Art"
. "The non-human outlook must be there . . . to correct our soft
conceit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Here the becoming-machinic of the body is not only a model of armoring
 but a means to expose <I>the inhuman</I> within the human. Lewis uses
 this trope, common in satire, to reduce the human to the physical in
 two related ways. First as a blind mechanism: "Men are sometimes so
 palpably machines, their machination is so transparent, that they are
 <I>comic,</I> as we say" (<I>MWA,</I> 95). And then, against our soft
 conceit, as a mere thing: "All men are necessarily comic: for they
 are all <I>things,</I> or physical bodies, behaving as <I>persons</I>"
 (<I>WB,</I> 158). Despite his anti-Bergsonism, Lewis is influenced here
 by the Bergson of <I>Le Rire</I> (1900 [Laughter]), who defines the
 comic in terms of the sudden exposure of a person as a mere mechanism:
 it is this degradation that is comic. Yet for Lewis a person is nothing
 but such a mechanistic thing; we are ridiculous only when we pretend
 to personhood.

<B></B>

<P>
Just as important to Lewis is the psychic economy of this comic effect,
and here he approaches Freud on humor (who was also influenced by Bergson,
as well as by Lipps). For Lewis the sudden exposure of the human as mere
mechanism is <I>satirical</I> because it mocks the humanist pretense
of free action: it reveals us as the "puppets" we are. But this sudden
exposure is <I>comic,</I> at least according to Freud, because the
mechanism thus revealed is the automatism of the instincts, and this
revelation eases instinctual tension; the comic is this release whereby
unpleasure is turned to pleasure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Lewis writes of the comic object in similar terms: "We are astonished
 and shocked, and we bark at him--we <I>laugh</I>--in order to relieve
 our emotion" (<I>MWA,</I> 95). Note the atavism of this laughter: not
 only is the comic <I>object</I> instinctually automatic, but so is the
 comic <I>effect.</I> It too renders us a "wild body," that "supreme
 survival that is us, the stark apparatus with its set of mysterious
 spasms: the most profound of which is laughter" (<I>WB,</I> 157).
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P>
For Lewis, then, we are comic because we are both automatic and reified,
puppets of blind instinct further reduced within modernity to the status
of mechanistic things. Such is the inhuman that he bids us to see as
comic. But to see it in this way is also to be screened from it: on the
one hand, the comedy "relieves emotion"; on the other hand, the satire
"stiffens" us. If Marinetti asks us to desire reification,

<B></B>

 Lewis invites us to laugh at it, and this comedy of reification is yet
 another troping of the destructive impulse in his work. Granted, this
 is but a turning, not a cancelling: his satire remains aggressive, his
 reduction of the human to the mechanistic is sadistic indeed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 This is true as well of his "stoical embrace" of "the brutality of
 mechanical life," or his sublimation of war into "romance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Again and again Lewis works to turn these shocks, the "most dramatic
 of ailments" (<I>BB,</I> 115), into a new sublime, and here too he
 understands the transformation in terms of psychic economy: "For all life
 must in some way be pleasure--even . . . the horror of destruction or
 the 'narrow escape' from it--namely, the pleasures of the battlefield,
 or of any 'moving accidents'" (<I>WLA,</I> 212).
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Sometimes, however, Lewis fails these transvaluations, and sometimes he
 does not attempt them at all--as if then the destructive impulse might
 be revealed as such, and he might enjoy the absolute pleasure of its
 complete expenditure. "Killing somebody must be the greatest pleasure
 in existence," he wrote as early as the first <I>Blast</I>. "Either
 like killing yourself without being interfered with by the instinct of
 self-preservation--or exterminating the instinct of self-preservation
 itself!" (<I>B,</I> 133).

<P>
Of course this is part swagger, but it is also part wager, and at one
point, in 1922, Lewis grasps the stake: "The game consists in seeing
how near you can get without the sudden extinction and neutralization
that awaits you as matter, or as the machine. In our bodies we have got
already so near to extinction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Could it be that this game is not the grim sideshow that it seems,
 that the moves of a Lewis or a Marinetti are not as aberrant as they
 appear? Could it be that the very stake of high modernism involves
 wagers such as these with reification and death? I see such res of
 reification and death approached and/or averted everywhere in European
 art of this time--not only in the dysfunctional automatons of dada and
 the dismembered mannequins of surrealism (what Lewis called "Hoffmann
 puppets"), but also in the machinic men of socialist constructivisms
 and the scarecrow-statues of fascistic neoclassicisms (what Lewis called
 "robot-men" and "living statues").
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 This is not to suggest some grand zeitgeist--that this period marches in
 lockstep to the death drive. But it is to hear, below the noisy appeals
 of the time, the various quests for the New Man as well as the various
 returns to the Old Humanism, the insistent call of the inhuman.

For both men the machine was an actual agent of bodily transformation and
a fantasmatic re of the same, and this uncertain status of position
and cause is part of its anxious attraction. On this uncertainty see
Victor Tausk, "On the Origins of Schizophrenia in the 'Influencing
Machine'" , <I>The Psychoanalytic Quarterly</I> 2 , essential
reading for the modernist imaginary of the machine.

<P>
There is renewed interest in Marinetti and Lewis (several books on
Lewis alone have appeared in the last few years), conditioned in
part by two general factors: the need to complicate the antitypal
opposition of modernism and fascism in visual culture, and the sense
that the metropolitan West is in the midst of qualitative technological
transformation.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT3" HREF="#REF3">3</A>.
This structural limitation may well be the ideological function of
this (or any) double logic. I point to other modernist and marxist
positions on technology below, but most remain with the double logic of
a fantasy of a Frankensteinian dismemberment of the body (pronounced in
<I>Capital</I>) versus a fantasy of its Futurist phallicization. In his
account of technology as both amputation and extension McLuhan expresses
this logic exactly. Not incidentally, McLuhan was inspired by Lewis: he
sought Lewis out in St. Louis in the early 1940s, published an essay
on his work in 1944, and founded a journal in homage to <I>Blast</I>
called <I>Counterblast.</I> What continuities regarding technological
shock, art, subjectivity, and politics might be found between "the new
ego" proposed by Lewis in <I>Blast</I> 1 and "the extensions of man"
traced by McLuhan in <I>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</I>

In this modernist imagery might the machinic be the fundamental
re and <I>the body</I> the prosthetic? In his "Mirror Stage" paper
(1936-49) Lacan does describe the body-ego image as "automaton" and
"statue"--res uncannily similar to the machinic and neoclassical
spectres of the 1920s that also ambiguate between the intact and the
fragmentary (Jacques Lacan, "The Mirror Stage," in <I>&Eacute;crits,</I>
trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: W. W. Norton, 1977], 2-3;
hereafter abbreviated <I>E</I>). On related issues see my "Armor Fou"
(<I>October</I> 56 [spring 1991]) and my "Postmodernism in Parallax."

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT5" HREF="#REF5">5</A>.
I return to this paradox below. Neoclassicism and machinism cannot
be opposed as whole to fragment in European art of the 1920s. Often
machinic res are armored, made whole, while neoclassical ones
are broken into bits ("scarecrow[s]," as Adorno once remarked of
the neoclassicism of Igor Stravinsky, "damaged and disempowered by
a patched-up arrangement of dreams" [Theodor Adorno, <I>Musikalische
Schriften</I> vols. 1-3, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp
Verlag, 1978), 391]). And sometimes the machinic and the neoclassical are
combined, and not just in fascist art (e. g., Mario Sironi); underneath
the machinic veneer of a L&eacute;ger or a Le Corbusier there often lies
a neoclassical measure. In his caustic way Lewis captured the convergence
of these uncanny tendencies as so many symptoms of reification: "That
is what is afoot," he wrote in a 1934 text titled "Power-Feeling and
Machine-Age Art," "the <I>living</I> statue--which comes upon the
scene hand-in-hand with the robot-man--the herd of machine-minders
mingling, without recognition of a difference, with the herd of Hoffman
[<I>sic</I>] puppets" (Wyndham Lewis, "Power-Feeling and Machine-Age
Art," <I>Time and Tide</I> [October 1934]; reprinted in <I>Wyndham
Lewis on Art,</I> ed. Walter Michel and C. J. Fox [New York: Funk and
Wagnalls, 1969], 287). Note the ambiguity, typical of Lewis, between
the individual-as-mass and the mass-as-person.

These futures differed from regime to regime, as did the subjects
interpellated by them; and different styles were developed accordingly. In
this regard, Futurist technophilia is especially overdetermined:
part masculinist fantasy, part political allegory, it is also driven
by technological underdevelopment. The Vorticist situation is quite
different. "We've had machines here in England for a donkey's years,"
Lewis once told Marinetti. "They're no novelty to <I>us</I>" (Wyndham
Lewis, <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> [1937; London: Calder and
Boyars, 1967], 34; hereafter abbreviated <I>BB</I>). Here I focus on the
machine as fantasy, which is its privileged role in modernism, even when
it res "objectivity."

As is well known, Marinetti was an early collaborator of Mussolini, Lewis
a sometime admirer of Hitler. Like many of the wartime generation, both
were influenced by Georges Sorel, particularly his <I>Reflections on
Violence</I> , a text of enormous influence on emergent fascisms
(it was first translated into English by T. E. Hulme, a Vorticist
associate). In fact, Futurism and Vorticism constitute an avant-garde
best described as Sorelian: both partake of the "general strike," of
the imperative to mythologize events and to activate images, especially
of violence. Lewis discusses Sorel in <I>The Art of Being Ruled</I>
, and the program of his 1937 autobiography, <I>Blasting and
Bombardiering,</I> is pure Sorel: "I have set out to show how war, art,
civil war, strikes and coup d'&eacute;tats dovetail into each other"

Marinetti, old Italy, especially Venice, is cloacal in another way. In
a sense, he evokes such historical stages, individual and national, in
order to break with them, to allow a Futurist identity to emerge from
them. In "Against Past-Loving Venice," a leaflet dropped from the Clock
Tower in Venice on 8 July 1910, Marinetti writes: "We renounce the old
Venice . . . <I>cloaca maxima</I> of pass&eacute;ism. We want to cure
and heal this putrefying city, magnificent sore from the past. . . . We

As in this fantasy-memory of a factory beach in "Tactilism" : "I

breath. I was drinking from a sea-chalice brimming with genius as far
as the rim. With its long searing flames, the sun was vulcanizing my
body" (<I>M,</I> 110). It is as if Marinetti secretly identified with
Vulcan as a crippled (castrated) god who imaginatively forges perfect
(phallic) bodies. This "vulcanizing" is also evocative of the Freudian
"baking" of the epidermis into the "protective shield" (more on this

Or is this notion of prophylaxis too readily turned into a justification
for any such representation of violence? As we will see, Vorticism seeks

Yet here again is a rub: with his "square crashing jaws" and "scornful
jutting lips" (<I>M,</I> 158), Mussolini projects the other, castrative
aspect of the fetish as well. ("Paradoxical as it may seem, the Fascist
phallus is, like Freud's Medusa, at once hyperphallic and castrating"
[Schnapp, "Heads of State," 27].) Productive of fear, anxiety, resentment,
was this castrative aspect "castrated" in turn in the mutilated body of
the hanged Mussolini?

<P>
Mussolini dropped Marinetti when he was no longer useful, but his imaging
of Mussolini remained important. Today it might be explored along the
lines of the body politics examined by Claude Lefort in <I>L'Invention
democratique</I> (Paris: Fayard, 1981; English translation in <I>The
Political Forms of Modern Society,</I> ed. John B. Thompson [Cambridge,
Mass.: MIT Press, 1986]; hereafter abbreviated <I>PF</I>). For Lefort
there are three paradigmatic stages of the libidinal relation of
subjects to leaders in the modern West. The first is the king of the
ancien r&eacute;gime held to possess a double body, at once mortal
and immortal, patterned after the double body of Christ (here Lefort
draws on the classic study by Ernst Kantorowicz, <I>The King's Two
Bodies</I> [1957]). The kingdom is also conceived as a body that
the king both images (in the familiar synecdoche "I am France") and
directs as its head. Thus when the democratic revolution decapitates
the king, it also decapitates its own body politic, and its imaginary
coherence begins to fall apart. "Power appears as an empty place," Lefort
writes. "Unity cannot now efface social division" (<I>PF,</I> 303). For
Lefort totalitarianism emerges as a belated "attempt to resolve [the]
paradoxes" of this empty place of power. The metaphorics of the double
body is resurrected by the re of "the egocrat," who guarantees "the
representation of the People-as-One." But the representation depends on
two things: "the integrity of the body" and "the incessant production
of enemies" (<I>PF,</I> 298-99).

<P>
How different is the "Futurist fascism" red by Marinetti? It, too,
reinstates the double body of leader and nation in an imaginary coherence
of the two. It, too, sees democracy as an empty place of power, and
it, too, requires enemies of the state within and without. And in both
regimes the machine is used as an image of social organization. And yet
there are also crucial differences. For example, in "Futurist fascism" the
machine is not productivist and proletarian (a distinction must be drawn,
as Schnapp suggests in "<I>18 BL,"</I> between <I>mechanization</I> as
a re of the subject in functional mesh with the social factory,
and <I>metallization</I> as a re of the subject in imaginary
identification with the military nation), and the fascist leader is
not an egocrat to identify with but a "phallocrat" to bind with. (In
this regard a further contrast can be made between the body politics of
Mussolini and Hitler.) For more recent meditations on the despot body
and the mass subject, see Kenneth Dean and Brian Massumi, <I>First and
Last Emperors</I> (New York: Autonomedia, 1992), and Michael Warner, "The

This association of the crowd and the unconscious as "feminine" threats
runs throughout Lewis, as it does in crowd discourse from Le Bon through
Freud. Lewis is more ambivalent about the crowd, for it can serve as a
site of "mobilization." In <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> he recalls
the wartime crowds: "So periodically we shed our individual skin, or
are apt to, and are purged in big being. An empty throb. . . . Does
not the Crowd in life spell death? . . . The Crowd is an immense
anaesthetic towards death, such is its immemorial function" (<I>BB,</I>
79-80). This "death" that is an "anaesthetic towards death" is
fundamental to Lewis on art and subjectivity.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT55" HREF="#REF55">55</A>.
Note the suggestion of pollution here, and the operation of abjection. If
in Marinetti the new ego is a man-machine that emerges from feminine
waters, in Lewis it is a "hysterical wall" set up against the same. Both
draw on the unconscious symbolism of the masculinist ego noted by Lacan
in the "Mirror Stage": "the formation of the <I>I</I> is symbolized
in dreams by a fortress, or a stadium--its inner arena and enclosure,
surrounded by marshes and rubbish-tips, dividing it into two opposed
fields of contest where the subject flounders" (<I>E,</I> 5). This
symbolism suggests a fairytale of patriarchy, an almost phylogenetic
feudalism inscribed in the structure of Western masculinity.

Wilhelm Worringer, <I>Abstraction and Empathy,</I> trans. Michael Bullock
(New York: International Universities Press, 1953), 13; hereafter
abbreviated <I>AE.</I> This text is often discussed in relation to
expressionism, but Vorticism answered to the Worringerian will to
abstraction more radically (expressionism is empathic in comparison). This
also points to another difference between Vorticism and Futurism. The
notion of empathy may have passed into Futurism through Benedetto Croce
(who discusses Lipps in his <I>Aesthetics</I> [1909]); in any case an
"empathic" eclipse of distance between subject and object is fundamental
to Futurism. This is one reason why Lewis refers Futurism to impressionism
and dismisses both as realisms.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT60" HREF="#REF60">60</A>.
For Worringer the "intermediate stage" between the two poles, which
resolves them in an ideal form, is the "Northern artistic volition,"
especially as manifest in German Gothic, which resonated at the time with
German expressionism. This art history according to "race psychology"
(see note 62) brought Worringer close to Nazism.

created not only the first gods, but also the first art."

<P>
A crucial medium of ideas for Vorticist circles, Hulme was first
influenced by Bergson; he then translated Sorel <I>(Reflections on
Violence);</I> and upon meeting Worringer in Berlin he embraced his
philosophy of art. Like several Vorticists and Futurists, Hulme died
in the war he had welcomed. In <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> Lewis
recounts a tempestuous relationship complicated by the fact that Hulme
preferred the work of Jacob Epstein.

The Worringerian model is informed by a developmental logic that
ranks cultures according to a racialist hierarchy. Residual in the
discipline of art history as developed in the late nineteenth century,
this racialism was pronounced in Lewis. But it did not contradict his
primitivism. However opposed to the modernist cult of "the primitive," he
insisted that "the Art-instinct is permanently primitive" (<I>B,</I> 33).

Lewis strove to combine these two res in his own protoganists and

in Lewis "we recognize the thought of the modern man and the energy of
the cave-man" (T. S. Eliot, review of <I>Tarr,</I> by Wyndham Lewis,
<I>Egoist</I> [September 1918]: 106).

<a NAME="FOOT64" HREF="#REF64">64</A>.
The cubist imbrication of re and ground, to which the Vorticist
version is often related, does not register in this psychic way at
all. Jameson locates "the inner logic of [Lewis's] stylistic practice"
in a related tension between the sheer energy of his sentences and the
violent closure of his narratives (Jameson, <I>Fables of Aggression,</I>
30).

reading in turn suggests that "the spatial" can serve as an abstraction
for "the social," as it sometimes does in Lewis.

In a short play of the same title in <I>Blast,</I> Lewis writes apropos
of "personality": "It is the one piece of property all communities have

becomes it. It imitates and assimilates that Ego until it is no longer

who seems to respond to a similar drive in a different way. Like other
dadaists and surrealists, Ernst played with another form of hardening also
developed in Lewis--a becoming-insect of the body. But he did so in a way
that inverts its use there: first to mock the becoming-machine of man,
and second to explore the imbrication of death in sexuality (thus the
significance of the surrealist motif of the praying mantis, the female
of which kills the male in mating). The classic texts in the surrealist
milieu are by Roger Callois: "La Mante religieuse," <I>Minotaure</I>
5 (February 1934), and "Mim&eacute;tisme et psychasth&eacute;nie
l&eacute;gendaire," <I>Minotaure</I> 7 (June 1935). The convulsive
possession of the subject by space theorized by Caillois is precisely
what Lewis feared.

<P>
Lewis was fascinated by insects (his library contained an annotated
copy of <I>Ants, Bees, and Wasps</I> by John Lubbock), which he often
used, like machines, to re his ideal of aggressive armoring. In
"The Artist Older Than the Fish," he glosses an account by J. H. Fabre,
a French entomologist for whom all action was driven by instinct:

Fabre describes the creative capabilities of certain beetles, realizable
on their own bodies; beasts with a record capacity for turning their
form and colour impulses into living flesh. These beetles can convert
their faces into hideously carved and detestable masks, can grow
out of their bodies menacing spikes, and throw up on top of their
heads sinister headdresses, overnight. Such changes in their personal
appearance, conceived to work on the psychology of their adversaries,
is possibly not a very profound or useful invention, but it is surely
a considerable feat. Any art worth the name is, at the least, a feast
of this decription. The New Guinea barred and whitewashed masks are an
obvious parallel [note this last association with "primitive" abstraction]
[Wyndham Lewis, <I>The Caliph's Design</I> , ed. Paul Edwards (Santa
Barbara: Black Sparrow Press, 1989), 66; hereafter abbreviated <I>CD</I>].

Among other commonalities, Worringer and Freud shared a
psychophysiological model of development, and both were driven by an
epistemological mandate to correlate new discourses--here art history
and psychoanalysis--with the principles of biology and/or physics. (In
this regard the primary reference for Freud was Fechner; for Worringer
it was Lotze.)

In the same period Lewis writes of his fiction similarly: "Upwards
from the surface of existence a lurid and dramatic scum oozes and
accumulates into the characters we see" (Wyndham Lewis, "Inferior
Religions" [1917-27], in <I>The Complete Wild Body,</I> ed. Bernard
Lafourcade [Santa Barbara: Black Sparrow Press, 1982], 152; hereafter
abbreviated <I>WB</I>). As "expressions of the conservative nature of
living substance," Freud notes the return of certain fish to spawn, the
migration of certain birds, and the recapitulation inscribed in embryology
(<I>BPP,</I> 30-31).

Lewis defines the Tyro as "an elementary person; an elemental, in short"
(Wyndham Lewis, <I>Tyros and Portraits</I> [Leicester Galleries, April
1921]; reprinted in <I>WB,</I> 353). "These immense novices," he adds,
"brandish their appetites in their faces" (<I>WB,</I> 354).

In a private note Hulme all but images the eye as the point at which
the death drive is driven home: "The eyes, the beauty of the world, have
been organised out of faeces. Man returns to dust. So does the face of
the world to primeval cinders" (<I>S,</I> 227). What irony is there that
Lewis went blind?

In "On the Essence of Laughter" , Baudelaire called this convulsive
aspect "the satanic" in laughter, an old guise that Lewis often affected
(Charles Baudelaire, "On the Essence of Laughter," in <I>The Painter of
Modern Life and Other Essays,</I> ed. and trans. Jonathan Mayne [London:
Phaidon Press, 1964], 147-65).

His pictorial ambition to "bury Euclid deep in the living flesh"
is explicit enough (<I>Wyndham Lewis on Art,</I> ed. Michel and Fox,
40). Compare this note of Walter Benjamin: "Exposure of the mechanistic
aspects of the organism is a persistent tendency of the sadist. One can
say that the sadist sets out to substitute for the human organism the
image of machinery" (<I>Passagen-Werk,</I> ed. Rolf Tiedemann [Frankfurt:
Suhrkamp Verlag, 1982], 465-66).

As for the first transvaluation: "[Vorticism] was not an asylum from the
brutality of mechanical life. On the contrary it identified itself with
the brutality, in a stoical embrace" (Wyndham Lewis, <I>Wyndham Lewis
the Artist from "Blast" to Burlington House</I> [London: Laidlaw and
Laidlaw, 1939], 78). As for the second:

When <I>on joue sa vie,</I> it is not so much the grandeur of the
spectacle of destruction, or the chivalrous splendour of the appointments,
as the agitation in the mental field within, of the organism marked down
to be destroyed, that is impressive. It is that that produces "the light
that never was on land or sea," which we describe as "romance." Anything
upon which that coloration falls is at once transred. And the source
of light is within your own belly [<I>BB,</I> 115].

This "narrow escape" is one definition of the sublime. For his part
Marinetti seeks not to sublimate shock into the sublime but to arrest it
there. Thus in a letter to Severini from the front (20 November 1914):
"I believe . . . that the greatest war, lived with intensity by Futurist
painters, can produce real convulsions in their sensibility and spur them
towards a brutal simplification of very clear lines such as to strike and
incite the reader in the same way that battles strike and incite" (quoted
in Raffaele Carrieri, <I>Futurism,</I> trans. Leslie van Renssalaer White
[Milan: Edizioni del Milione, 1963], 158).
