<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How admiringly the officer in the penal colony surveys his instrument
of execution. With what zeal he explains its mechanism. Curator that he
is, he carefully avoids touching the surface of the Old Commandant's
drawings. But how lovingly he traces their pattern in the air. The
visiting researcher, the voyager, cannot read the script that the officer
marks for him, but he understands the performance enough to return the
compliment that the officer's gestures demand. He says "evasively,"
of the drawings and the script, "It's very artistic" (<I>Es ist sehr
kunstvoll</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  "Yes," said the officer with a laugh, putting the folder away again,
  "it's no copy-book lettering [<I>keine Sch&ouml;nschrift</I>] for
  school children" ("IPC" 135 [159]). The officer's gestures establish a
  context for judging his beloved Commandant's apparatus: it should be
  viewed, or read, as a work of art. He wants this machine to be seen,
  however, not merely as one specific artwork but as the very form of
  art in general. He constantly insists on the transferability of what
  is "artistic" from one domain of technique to another. The component
  of the machine that writes on or, better, stabs into the condemned is
  like a farm implement, a harrow, but with a critical difference. This
  particular harrow, the officer claims, a piece of glass, performs with
  far greater artistry than does any ordinary farmer's tool; it is much
  more artful (<I>viel kunstgem&auml;&szlig;er</I>) ("IPC" 129 [153]).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many critics, including Stanley Corngold, have usefully explored how the
penal apparatus represents the art of writing itself, but in the story
the officer makes an even bigger claim than do the critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  For him, the apparatus represents not merely writing, but "art." Central
  features of "art-making," he suggests, pertain to widely diverse
  technical practices: farming, writing,

<B></B>

punishment, and drawing. The voyager notices the implication of the
officer's views and asks of the Old Commandant, "Did he then combine
everything in his own person? Was he soldier, judge, engineer, chemist,
and cartoonist [<I>Zeichner</I>]?" ("IPC" 131 [155]). Indeed, he
did. Above all, however, the Commandant was a technician; the officer,
curator of his superior's works of art. Kafka's "In the Penal Colony"
ruminates on punishment's status as an art, and therefore dwells also,
through its insistence on the transferability of "artfulness" between
media, on the dismal possibility that all arts contain an element of
punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer guides the voyager (or hopes to guide him) through an
appreciation of the texts and visual signs of the apparatus. He wants
him to learn to read the machine. But the officer also regularly and
insistently leads the researcher through an experience of sounds,
particularly the sound of silence. When the officer describes the sort
of reading a condemned man is supposed to do--he is supposed to read his
sentence in his body--the officer says that the condemned "purses his
lips as if he were listening. You've seen that it isn't easy to decipher
the script with one's eyes; but our man deciphers it with his wounds" (Es
geschieht ja weiter nichts, der Mann f&auml;ngt blo&szlig; an, die Schrift
zu entziffern, er spitzt den Mund, als horche er) ("IPC" 137 [160]). His
wounds seem to make some sound to the condemned and so reading becomes
listening. But what sound is there in pain? In <I>The Body in Pain</I>
Elaine Scarry has argued that pain itself is inherently aphasic because
it is impossible to vocalize any precise or meaningful calculus of pain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Momentarily I will analyze the sounds that the condemned hears but first
it is crucial to consider how his wounding sounds to the onlookers. As the
officer rhapsodizes the process of the execution in the days of the Old
Commandant, the focus is as much on what can be heard as on what is seen:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Before hundreds of pairs of eyes--all the spectators standing on tiptoe
right up to the top of the slopes--the condemned man was laid under the
harrow by the commandant himself. . . . And then the execution began! No
discordant note disturbed the working of the machine [Kein Mi&szlig;ton
st&ouml;rte die Arbeit der Maschine]. Many [of the spectators from the
penal colony] even ceased to watch and lay with their eyes closed in
the sand; all of them knew: Now justice is taking its course [Jetzt
geschieht Gerechtigkeit]." ["IPC" 140 ]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Justice takes its course quietly and, more importantly, as quiet<I>.</I>
Punishment is, Kafka suggests, the art of sounding silence. In the old
days, all of the spectators knew, as they lay with their eyes closed
in the sand, that punishment's point lay also in its sounds. In this,
the essential feature of the apparatus is not the bed, not the designer,
not the harrow, but the felt stub (<I>Filzstumpf</I>), the revolting
silencer. In the officer's first description of the felt, he says
"it can be easily adjusted to push straight into the man's mouth," and
its "object is to prevent screaming." The greatest artfulness in the
apparatus lies in precisely its mechanisms for producing silence. And
since "In the Penal Colony" insists on the transferability of "artfulness"
from one domain of technique to another, Kafka's worries about silence,
in this story, must extend to other arts as well.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To return to the officer who manipulates and aspires to produce silence,
he too has worries about the silence that is his medium. He suspects
that the silence surrounding his machine in the penal colony may no
longer reflect acquiescence in, awe at, and fear of the forms of justice
enacted by the machine but rather his, and the machine's, complete
irrelevance. Indeed, Kafka uses the phrase, "<I>in der Strafkolonie</I>,"
in the first paragraph of the story in order to report that there is now,
under the New Commandant, diminished interest in the inventions of the
former regime ["Das Interesse f&uuml;r diese Exekution war wohl auch in
der Strafkolonie nicht sehr gro&szlig;"] ("IPC" 127 [151]). The officer
is not only the sole member of the colony to defend the apparatus, but
he is also, and more forcefully, solitary in his sustained interest in it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The officer is not, however, completely convinced that the new kind
 of silence should be heard as disinterest. Just before he describes
 how the spectators formerly buried their eyes in the sand to listen
 to the machine--that is, in the first half of the same paragraph--he
 addresses this second type, the silence of disinterest, and claims that
 the people of the colony only <I>pretend</I> not to care. He claims that,
 "although no one will admit it, there are still plenty of supporters
 of the Old Commandant" ("IPC" 139).

If you went into the tea-house today, that's to say on an execution day,
and listened to what people were saying you'd probably hear nothing but
ambiguous remarks [Wenn Sie heute, also an einem Hinrichtungstag, ins
Teehaus gehen und herumhorchen, werden Sie vielleicht nur zweideutige
&Auml;u&szlig;erungen h&ouml;ren]. They'd all of them be supporters,
but under the present commandant and given his present beliefs they're
completely useless as far as I'm concerned. ["IPC" 139-40 ]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From silence in the valley to quiet doublemeanings in the tea room; how
different these silences are. The artist-officer aspires to reproduce
the silence of admiration, fear, and acquiescence, but faces instead the
dismaying silence of irrelevance. "In the Penal Colony," then, turns on
the equivocal (<I>zweideutige</I>) nature of silence, and on the tension
between silences that acquiesce or say yes, and those that say no, or,
what is the same, it doesn't matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Silence is relevant to "In the Penal Colony" in two modes: as yes and
as no--the absolutely opposed sounds of silence. This equivocation in
silence comes through most clearly in the story's climax, its moment
of superlative punishment, when the officer subjects himself to his own
justice. Then the machine begins to work on its own, like an apparatus
of the divine, yes, a <I>deus ex machina.</I> After he strips and is
strapped to the bed by the soldier and the condemned man, the officer
cannot hit the machine's crank to start it, but it doesn't matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The bed vibrated, the needles danced over the skin, the harrow moved
gently up and down. The voyager had been staring at it for some time
before it occurred to him that a wheel in the designer should have been
grating; and yet all was still, not even the faintest whirring could
be heard. As a result of this silent working the machine positively
escaped attention [Der Reisende hatte schon eine Weile hingestarrt,
ehe er sich erinnerte, da&szlig; 

<B></B>

ein Rad im Zeichner h&auml;tte kreischen sollen; aber alles war still,
nicht das geringste Surren war zu h&ouml;ren. Durch diese stille Arbeit
entschwand die Maschine f&ouml;rmlich der Aufmerksamkeit]. ["IPC" 150

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something about the officer's unspoken confession and his decision
to punish himself achieves at least the formal perfection of the
Commandant's penal regime: total silence. But to know what is perfect
about this peculiar punishment, and whether or why Kafka frets about it,
it is necessary to understand the judgment that precedes it, for there
has indeed been a judgment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Quite early in the story, the voyager intuits that he has been delegated
by the New Commandant of the colony to judge his predecessor's penal
apparatus. Nonetheless he worries that any criticism of the machine
will provoke the colonists to respond, "You are a stranger, hold your
peace." During their discussion at the scene of execution, the officer
makes the voyager's status as judge explicit, and he also spells out more
precisely the questions of voice and silence at issue in the trial of
the machine. He desperately wants the voyager, not to hold his peace,
but to call out an appeal on behalf of the officer in the court of
public opinion. He wants this in order to prove that the silence around
the machine is still definitive of its power, and not a mark of its
impotence. It's therefore the machine's production of silence that must
be judged by the voyager. He must determine whether the apparatus cranks
out yes's or no's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer imagines that the judgment of his machine might take one
of two possible courses. The researcher might return to town after
the execution and talk about the machine, or he might return and be
silent. The officer expects the respective outcomes of speech and silence
to be radically different. If the voyager should return to town and
drop a chance remark such as "We only used torture in the Middle Ages,"
the officer expects to see the New Commandant, upon hearing this remark,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

pushing his chair aside and rushing out on to the balcony, I can see
his ladies streaming out after him, I can hear his voice--the ladies
call it a voice of thunder [<I>ich h&ouml;re seine Stimme--die Damen
nennen sie eine Donnerstimme</I>]--and what he now says goes like this:
"A famous researcher from the West . . . has just said that our own
procedure . . . is inhumane. Given this verdict [<I>Urteil</I>] . . .,
I naturally cannot tolerate this procedure any longer. With effect from
today I therefore ordain--etc. [<I>und so weiter</I>]" ["IPC" 142 ]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka need not divulge <I>what</I> he will ordain; the content of the
Law doesn't matter, only its process, and so the sentence concludes with
"and so on." Only the form of verdicts and pronouncements matters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Should the commandant pronounce his new ordinance, his authoritative voice
of power would be laid over the researcher's interpretative voice. About
this, the officer says, "You will want to cry out [that you never
gave such a verdict] but a lady's hand covers your mouth. . ." ("IPC"
143). In this first account of the course of justice, the voyager's
failure to keep his silence about the machine paves the way for the
voice of thunder, the sounds that smash (this is Jehovah's voice). The
apparatus's brutal silencing

<B></B>

power will be replaced by a lady's--also brutal as represented
here--palm. In this scenario, the silence produced by the apparatus is
one of irrelevance, weaker even than a woman's hand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his second scenario of the course of justice, the officer imagines
that if the voyager should initially hold his peace, the reverse effects
will obtain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Unless you are asked directly, you should on no account express an
opinion; but what you do say must be brief and non-committal; it
should appear that you find it hard to discuss the matter, that you
feel embittered, that if you were to speak openly you would almost start
cursing and swearing. . . . [<I>man soll merken, da&szlig; es Ihnen schwer
wird, dar&uuml;ber zu sprechen, da&szlig; Sie verbittert sind, da&szlig;
Sie, falls Sie offen reden sollten, geradezu in Verw&uuml;nschungen
ausbrechen m&uuml;&szlig;ten. . . .</I>]. Your bitterness, which we want
them to recognize, is of course amply justified, but not in the way the
commandant imagines. He will naturally misunderstand it completely and
interpret it to suit his own book. That's what my plan depends on [Er
nat&uuml;rlich wird es vollst&auml;ndig mi&szlig;verstehen und in seinem
Sinne deuten. Darauf gr&uuml;ndet sich mein Plan]. ["IPC" 144 ]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer's plan rests firmly on silence's shiftiness and equivocation,
and on the interchangeability of yes and no. He expects that the New
Commandant, taking silence for criticism, will invite the researcher
to speak before the assembled public, not recognizing that his
silence actually implies an affirmation of the machine. Once given
the opportunity to speak, the voyager will, the officer hopes, make
a passionate appeal for the machine; this defense of the apparatus
will then be followed by the officer's own. The officer promises, "If
my speech doesn't drive him out of the hall, it will force him to his
knees, so that he has to confess: Old Commandant, to your power I bow"
("IPC" 145). Here the power of the officer's fantasies about voice,
silence, and potency become clearer. The officer expects to use silence
to prepare an appeal that will in turn silence others. He appeals for a
spoken defense that will confirm the power of the silences produced by
the machine. But his appeal for an appeal, his call for a voice to set
against thunder, is rejected. When the officer asks, "That is my plan;
are you willing to help me carry it out?" the voyager responds, simply,
"No" ("IPC" 146). This verdict on silence defines the silence around the
machine as that of irrelevance and thus convicts the officer, machine,
and Old Commandant not of injustice, but of impotence. It is precisely
because the story is interested in force--not in justice--that it is
difficult to read it politically.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now condemned, the officer has himself been silenced; his case is closed
by a no that came in place of yes. What happens next in the story unfolds
"as if" of necessity; silence is, of course, at the heart of it all. In
response to the no, the officer is silent, and blinks several times with
his eyes fixed on the voyager. The latter asks if the officer wants
an explanation. "The officer nods silently" ("IPC" 146). The voyager
provides an explanation and

The officer turn[s] towards the machine, grasp[s] one of the brass rods
and then, leaning back a little, look[s] up at the designer as if to
check that all was in order. . . . It didn't look

as if the officer had been listening. "So the procedure hasn't convinced
you?" he murmur[s], smiling as an old man smiles at the nonsense of a
child. . . . "Then the time has come." ["IPC" 146]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, the officer begins to prepare his own punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, one could say that self-imposed punishment, that which is no
imposition, is no penalty, and that instinct or intuition whittles the
beginning of this scene of punishment to a single detail.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He only had to stretch out a hand towards the harrow for it to raise
and lower itself several times, until it reached the right position to
receive him; he merely gripped the edge of the bed and it began at once
to vibrate; the felt stub came to meet his mouth, one could see that the
officer did not actually want it, but his hesitation lasted only for a
moment, he quickly submitted and accepted it. All was now ready, only
the straps were still hanging down at the sides, but these were clearly
unnecessary, the officer had no need to be fastened down. ["IPC" 150]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only the felt stub is unwanted. Almost imperceptible is his hesitation
before it. Almost imperceptible is the punishment it enforces. The art
of the machine is in forcing the convict to take this felt. Remember
that the first time the officer had described the felt, he remarked,
"Its object is to prevent screaming and biting of the tongue. The man
is bound to take the felt of course, since otherwise his neck would be
broken by the neck strap" ("IPC" 130). The force of this transaction
precedes what "counts" as the force of punishment, the actual inscription
of the body. Through the felt, the machine manipulates psychology as
well as physiology; it is not merely the body, as so many have argued,
that feels the force of the apparatus' punishment; it is also the voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Andreas Gailus calls the "somatization" of the ideologies inscribed
by the machine, the transformation of ideologemes, like "honor thy
superiors," into bodily matter also involves teaching the psyche, in the
form of the voice, that it cannot escape the body. The second time the
officer remarks on the felt stub, he says of it, "After two hours, the
felt stub is removed, for the man no longer has the strength to scream"
("IPC" 136). This is the point at which the condemned begins listening to
his wounds, which means "pursing his lips" as if he were listening. The
opaque script is as good as silence, and the condemned comes to know
voicelessness, the incapacity to contest meaning. The condemned knows
he is beyond the realm of disagreement or acquiescence--here is his
enlightenment (<I>Verstand</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In focusing on the role of silence in punishment, Kafka has noticed
something about the practice of punishment that even the master
interpreter of its meaning-making functions missed. In <I>Discipline and
Punish</I> Michel Foucault famously elaborates the transition from the
royal punishments, the spectacles of power and torture of the body of
the eighteenth century, to the democratic penitentiary and the discipline
of the soul of the liberal nineteenth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  He frames the book's argument with two examples, an account of the
  1757 execution of a regicide and a list of rules for young prisoners

<B></B>

from 1837. Notable in both stories, although Foucault does not note it,
is the amount of attention paid to voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The eyewitness to the eighteenth-century execution carefully records when
screams, pleas, and curses were expected from the condemned, and when they
in fact occurred. Near the end of his account, the witness reports this,
"When the four limbs had been pulled away, the confessors came to speak
to him; but his executioner told him that he was dead, though the truth
was that I saw the man move, his lower jaw moving from side to side as
if he were talking" (<I>DP</I> 5). The narrative of the execution is
structured by a concern for what happens with the man's voice, not merely
his body. Similarly, the list of rules for young prisoners begins with the
requirement that "At first drum-roll, [they] rise and dress in silence,"
and concludes with the injunction that after the convicts go to bed at
the end of the day, "the cell doors are closed and the supervisors go
the rounds in the corridors, to ensure order and silence" (<I>DP</I>
6-7). Silence is as central to the punishment Foucault describes,
whether royalist or democratic, as to Kafka's, but his own account misses
the definitive element of punishment in a variety of Western cultures,
though it is institutionalized differently in each.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Punishment seeks to control not merely the body in the one case and the
soul in the other, <I>but always the voice.</I> The condemned are those
and only those who have exhausted their appeals, their calling out, or,
as in "In the Penal Colony," have been prevented from calling out at
all. They are permitted no defense and are denied even the opportunity
to cry out. Their conviction stands, and with it the regime's narrative
of who and what they are. Only silence can secure the meaning of a
punishment, which always at some level means "a final answer." Silence
must therefore fall on a punishment if it is to succeed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, there are differences in the types of silence demanded by
monarchic spectacle and by liberal discipline and observation. The
monarchs Foucault describes want silence only after they have extracted
particular kinds of sounds--notes of confession, tones of guilt,
cries for pardon--but they do in the end wish to still the wagging
jaw. Monarchic punishment wants the "quieting" to be <I>seen</I> so
that royal force will be felt. Democratic punishment, in contrast,
wants not a full performance of the death of voice, but, simply,
silence. Since democratic punishments, in contrast to monarchic ones,
rest on the fiction that the polity's laws and punishments reflect the
perfect consent of the citizenry (rather than on force), silence is all
the more imperative in a democracy. Silence after punishment signifies the
end of contest; it seems to make sensible a general communal acquiescence
in the methods of making meaning that (claim to) have brought closure
to the case of a given criminal. Silence implies first acquiescence,
then consent. The U.S. has recently introduced what are being called
maxi-maxi prisons, where prisoners suffer solitary confinement in
"administrative segregation" for violations of prison regulations
committed while in other prisons. The most striking feature of these
prisons is the noise that fills their hallways: a cacophony of shouts,
groans, bellows, rattling of door handles, and banging of possessions
against walls. No less striking to the observer is the silence that falls
when the doors to the prison are closed and one stands outside its walls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In monarchies, silence

<B></B>

is proof of force; the democratic silence makes all citizens complicit
in punishment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Kafka is indubitably right to represent punishment by depicting
  silence. And thus music seems to be exactly the wrong genre for thinking
  about punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or does it? Perhaps it seems wrong only if one employs a limited idea
of what silence is. The third time the officer describes the work done
by the piece of felt, he refines his account of silence. Recall the
scene where the officer contrasts the silence of his contemporaries'
meaningless chitchat in the tearoom to the sort of silence the colonists
used to experience at an execution:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And then the execution began! No jarring sound [discordant note] disturbed
the working of the machine. Many even ceased to watch and lay with their
eyes closed in the sand; all of them knew: Now justice is taking its
course. In the silence, nothing could be heard but the moaning of the
condemned man, half muffled by the felt. Nowadays the machine cannot
wring from the man any groans that are too loud for the felt to stifle;
but in those days a corrosive fluid that we are no longer permitted to
use dripped from the inscribing needles. ["IPC" 140]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The harrow and the felt do not collaborate merely in order to silence;
their art is more diabolical. They first provoke the condemned to voice,
and then silence him. When the people in the penal colony lie down,
closing their eyes in the sand, to listen, they are listening to the
performance of silence, to groans stifled. Silence is surely not the
absence of sound--aren't there always at least rattling leaves, scratching
pens, and purring hard drives, or one's own heart--silence must more
particularly be the absence of voices that summon our attention. The
penal apparatus therefore <I>orchestrates</I> the force of voice, and
its death, its final descent into silence. The colonists are listening to
an opera. And so music is not, after all, the wrong art for representing
punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But where does this leave writing, for this is the art that most critics
believe Kafka to be representing (along with his anxieties about it) in
"In the Penal Colony." I do not mean to erase "writing" with the word
"music," nor to suggest that one mode of performance can simply substitute
for another. But the story does lead to the conclusion that the art of
punishment and the art of music both express something frightful about
art per se. The machine writes not just to inscribe, but to provoke the
very groans that it silences. If writing is the subject of "In the Penal
Colony," then it is specifically the kind that aspires to silence others
and, perhaps, also its author.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's representation of the penal apparatus lays bare, naked and
acquiescent, as the re of the officer, the aspiration of art to be
definitive. Over and over we hear in the critical literature that the term
"Kafkaesque" has come to define the modern, or even postmodern situation:
"Kafka is in the air," says political theorist Jane Bennett in a 1994
article.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  And as Corngold puts it, "the modern sensibility has become Kafkaesque."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  The officer punished himself with the phrase, "Be Just." He may as well
  have punished himself with the phrase, "Be definitive," for this is
  where he has failed, as Kafka has not. Perhaps Kafka was anxious about
  the danger of art's success, about his own potential to silence--or
  to provide answers.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, if the artist achieves silence in response to her work, is that
good or bad? Is silence a mark of awe and acquiescence or of apathy? An
aspiration to produce silence generates its own contradiction, since
silence is also the artist's worst reward. The officer is one such victim
of his decision to work in the medium of silence and to fall silent in the
presence of beauty. The artistry of the machine has worked on him. It is
beautiful to him, and therefore definitive and also just. He cannot bear
the idea of dismantling the machine. Kafka's exploration of a problem with
art compels a realization that beauty insists on retention. Or rather,
when people decide that something is beautiful, they cannot bear the idea
of its destruction. The beauty of the machine seems to the officer to
answer a raft of questions--about monarchy, about justice, about use--that
have never been asked. The officer's obsession with the beauty of his
machine blocks him from a rigorous ethical analysis of his practices of
punishment. Its beauty, definitive to his eyes, constitutes a distraction.

Kafka is famous for defamiliarizing the familiar. One wonders then
whether this problem of beauty's distractions is itself meant, finally,
to look ordinary. Is the apparatus in the penal colony meant to look like
something recognizable in daily life? Is the penal colony meant to look
like an ordinary place? Do problems of beauty and of being definitive in
fact inhabit the everyday realm of punishment that we see all the time
without seeing? I can think of no better illustration of the power of
aesthetic force to distract us from ethical questions than the Chicago
Metropolitan Correctional Center built by Harry Weese in 1975 at 71
W. Van Buren Street. Extraordinarily beautiful, the prison is triangular
and wafer thin, the cream stone almost disappears from some perspectives,
body become nothing in a ritual of reverse transubstantiation. Its windows
are slits. This is what sets it apart from the rest of the sky-reaching,
far-looking buildings of the Chicago Loop. In everything else it conforms
to the aesthetic standards of downtown. It is, at the very least, nice
for people in nearby buildings to look at.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The American Institute of Architects <I>Guide to Chicago</I> offers
a description of the building that includes verbal oddities that are
symptoms of the aesthetic distraction provoked by the building. The
entry includes these remarks:

Above the tenth-floor mechanical room, identifiable by its angled air
intakes, are five-inch-wide windows for the inmates' rooms. The long,
thin windows are meant to symbolize an opening that people could not
pass through. Not caring much about symbolism, some architecturally
disrespectful inmates discovered a way around this design feature and
escaped. Lights now wash the exterior, and bars have been added to the
interiors of cells."

So strong is the artist's belief in the power of art to be definitive that
the building project, as described here, involved a complete confusion
of the work that symbols and bars are supposed to do. But symbols and
aesthetic objects do do a great deal of work; they may not effectively
confine bodies, but they do constrain attention. Their force shows in
their ability to distract spectators from questions of ethics, judgment,
and practice. Definitiveness is a power to distract. The question, then,
that Kafka worries

<B></B>

over in "In the Penal Colony" is: to what extremes can aesthetic
distraction go? Or, how much power is working against our effort to
judge? If silence is his worry, it is also his relief. The aesthetic
object that falls into disregard, or grows stale, grants a furlough to
spectators so that they may judge.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka himself concludes his story with a further silence.

While the voyager was negotiating down below with a ferryman to take him
out to the steamer, the pair of them [the soldier and the condemned man]
came racing down the steps, in silence, for they did not dare to shout
[<I>rasten die zwei die Treppe hinab, schweigend, denn zu schreien
wagten sie nicht</I>]. But by the time they reached the foot of the
steps the voyager was already in the boat and the ferry man was just
casting off. They could still have managed to leap into the boat, but
the voyager picked up a heavy knotted rope from the deck, threatened
them with it and so held them at bay. ["IPC" 153 ]

In <I>Franz Kafka</I> Corngold contends that "Kafka helps create the
