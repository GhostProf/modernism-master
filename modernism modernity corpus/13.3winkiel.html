<p id="lead">In Walter Benjamin's 1931 essay, "Unpacking My Library," he remarks that  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is no living library that does not harbor a number of booklike creations from fringe areas. They need not be stick-in albums or family albums, autograph books or portfolios containing pamphlets or religious tracts; some people become attached to leaflets and prospectuses, others to handwriting facsimiles or typewritten copies of unobtainable books; and certainly periodicals can form the prismatic fringes of a library.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This essay considers Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro: An Anthology </i> as a "booklike creation from a fringe area." As Benjamin suggests, these border paraphernalia can take the form of scrapbooks, political ephemera&#x2014;such as manifestos&#x2014;and other detritus of the archive. Anthologies, of course, are collections of a sort. They contain disparate literary, musical, or artistic passages, works, or pieces and they are usually framed by an introduction. This frame, as Brent Edwards has argued, "flesh[es] out [the anthology's] history of use; and imagin[es] its scope of implication, its uses, its 'future.'"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Anthologies can often, as in the case of Alain Locke's <i>The New Negro </i>and certainly <i>The Norton Anthology of African American Literature,</i> institute a group of writers as canonical and envision a future in which the national assimilation of the "Negro" occurs. </p>

<p>Such was not the case with Cunard's <i>Negro. </i>It was banned in the British West Indies and several West African colonies on the grounds of its "seditiousness," and it prompted reactions from black activists and writers ranging from silence, to guarded 

<b></b>

praise, to great enthusiasm.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  What could not be denied about <i>Negro</i>'s achievement, however, was its articulation of a transnational African and African-diasporic world. <i>Negro </i>was certainly not the first text to do so. Elaborating a variety of political aims, W. E. B. Du Bois's <i>The Negro </i> and the<i> Crisis;</i> Marcus Garvey's <i>Negro World </i>and <i>Black Man</i>; and other Anglophone black periodicals such as the <i>New York Age, </i>the London-based the<i> Keys, </i>and Dus&#x00E9; Mohamed Ali's the<i> Ethiopian Times and Orient Review</i>; and Francophone journals such as <i>La D&#x00E9;p&#x00EA;che africaine</i> and<i> La Revue du monde noir </i>aimed at creating transnational solidarities. (I am using the term transnationalism rather than internationalism to denote how colonization and the slave trade created nation states composed of multinational populations who are situated both within and without a given territorially-bound nation.)<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Yet Cunard's <i>Negro Anthology </i>far outstripped previous efforts to document the formidable history and cultures of black people around the world. </p>

<p><i>Negro</i>'s transnational effort has, by and large, been obscured by critical attention to Cunard's racial romanticism and her refusal to acknowledge her race and class privilege as a white vanguard poet and activist.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In fact, <i>Negro </i>is now a nearly forgotten anthology. Besides objection to Cunard herself, <i>Negro</i>'s idiosyncratic collection of documents of African and African-diasporic experience&#x2014;including accounts of the middle passage, slavery, segregation, lynching, rape, forced labor and hunger as well as black artistic, historical and cultural achievements&#x2014;has recently been read as a "personal and anecdotal [rather] than global collection."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  I suggest, however, that <i>Negro </i>can be understood as recontextualizing white avant-gardist and socialist rupture within an African and African-diasporic modernity. The anthology combines a historical reconstruction of African and African-diasporic pasts with the revolutionary impulses documented by <i>Negro</i>'s communist and surrealist-inspired contributions, especially its manifestos and montage forms. In addition, reading <i>Negro</i> as a transnational modernist text articulated (at least in part) from the perspective of colonized and subject peoples of color makes modernism look less like a radical break with the past than a disjunctive crossing of past, present, and future, a crossing that expresses the condition of black modernity. </p>

<p>This reading undoubtedly goes against the grain of Cunard's primitivist intentions when examined by themselves. But I propose that we read <i>Negro</i> as a collectivist documentary project within whose revisionary context of colonial and racialized "peripheries" and "prehistories" its revolutionary contributions should be understood. In the case of <i>Negro, </i>I am investigating how avant-garde rupture meets the occulted history of African and African-diasporic modernity and how it intervenes in the racialized ground of Anglo-European modernism by making visible the constitutive function of racial difference. This manner of reading transnationally demonstrates how <i>Negro</i> sutures African and African-diasporic experience together&#x2014;its linguistic diversity, its generic fluidity, its wide-ranging and fragmented international and historical scope&#x2014;to expose its gaps and contradictions. These gaps might be considered as symptoms of transnationalism, its differences in unity, rather than as its flaws.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I see <i>Negro </i>as a fringe document, a border-crossing hybrid that has been historically overlooked as a signal articulation of the uneven race relations of the 1930s: situated as it is between the anti-imperialist&#x2014;yet 

<b></b>

often racially hierarchical&#x2014;initiatives of white cosmopolitanism and an increasingly powerful and organized black transnationalism. <i>Negro </i>is a document of war against imperialism and capitalism. It does not deconstruct the color line, but rather seeks to make clear the stakes involved for the underdeveloped world in a situation of on-going capitalist development and bourgeois forms of nationalism.  </p>

<p>At first glance, <i>Negro </i>does indeed appear to be a byproduct of modernist cosmopolitanism, offering from the standpoint of European universalism a collection of artifacts from "primitive" and "modern" cultures.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The anthology&#x2014;with its 200 entries by some 150 contributors (two-thirds of whom were black) and 385 illustrations&#x2014;contains poetry, manifestos, history, ethnography, photographs, and rant. It traverses Europe, the United States, South America, the West Indies, and Africa, and includes hate mail, a confidential French military circular, advertisements, French children's comics, folk songs and scores, ethnographic maps, and reproductions of African art. Its contributors include Zora Neale Hurston, Theodore Dreiser, W. E. B. Du Bois, Michael Gold, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Arturo Schomburg and includes poetry by Arna Bontemps, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Sterling Brown, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Alfred Kreymborg and Louis Zukofsky, to speak only of the American portion of the anthology. Its international contributors included Jomo Kenyatta, T. K. Utchay, Ben N. Azikiwe, the Cuban poet Nichol&#x00E1;s Guilli&#x00E9;n, the Haitian poet Jacques Roumain, the Brazilian <i>modernismo</i> Mario de Andrade, George Padmore, Raymond Michelet, translations by Samuel Beckett, contributions by Richard Aldington, surrealists Andr&#x00E9; Breton, Ren&#x00E9; Crevel, Ren&#x00E9; Char, Benjamin Peret, Yves Tanguy, Pierre Unik, Paul Eluard, Roger Callois, the South African writers William Plomer and Beatrice Hastings and many others. In many ways, <i>Negro </i>testifies to Cunard's mobility and access to circles of all sorts as a privileged cosmopolitan subject. It also gives evidence of the growing numbers of colonial elites at home in major metropolitan centers, if not necessarily the world.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Cunard gathered material for the anthology between two transatlantic trips to the United States and the Caribbean. The anthology was made in New York, Paris, and London where Cunard solicited contributions from members of avant-garde, scholarly, modernist, communist, pan-Africanist and black entertainment circles.  </p>

<p>The occluded significance of Cunard's <i>Negro</i> in accounts of modernism stems, in part, from the sheer critical difficulty of accounting for its disparities and contradictions: between its editorial endorsement of a programmatic communism and its contributions of sober historical scholarship, and between detailing the horrors of colonization and racism and its jubilant and often primitivist celebration of popular black entertainers, folk art, and African arts.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Michael North contends that the anthology's "episodic nature" creates "a weirdly dissociative effect," one that positions blacks within a rigid dichotomy as either "objects of pity or comedy."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  But far more than a rigid dichotomy, the anthology aims at a "panorama" of black struggles and achievements against a racist modernity. While Cunard's intent, at times, is "no less than a comprehensive history of the cultural, social, political, and artistic achievements of the black people of the world" (HRC), what surrealist Georges Sadoul called "une v&#x00E9;ritable encyclop&#x00E9;die de la question n&#x00E8;gre," at others, her aim is much more provisional.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  <i>Negro </i>is not, Cunard claims, "a <i>literary </i>anthology," but rather, it aspires to achieve a certain <i>method</i> of accounting

<b></b>

 for race. <i>Negro, </i>as Cunard wrote to Claude McKay, is "a very large symposium indeed with a definite and clearly defined intent: to throw light on the appalling way the entire colour 'question' is handled" (Cunard to McKay, 28 January 1932, HRC). Its method&#x2014;demonstrated by Cunard's manic accumulation of documents and photos of black experience and racism&#x2014;can be compared to surrealist ethnography, with its found objects and recognition of the occult practices of everyday life. <i>Negro</i> collects the scraps and ephemera of black expressive life in order to patch together a history&#x2014;combined with the revolutionary energy of vanguard communism&#x2014;that can transform the present.  </p>

<p>That Cunard became all-consumed by her documentary project might be understood as a desire for another kind of life that entailed an abnegation of self. The "prismatic fringes" of the library, as Benjamin suggests above, operate through desire: one becomes "attached" to sundry periodicals, leaflets, manuscript copies, and other scraps of the past. Even after the anthology was published, Cunard obsessively added to it, cramming her battered, torn copy of <i>Negro </i>with more newspaper clippings and notes (<i>HDF</i>, xi). Her desire for an alternative world registered itself through a frenzied accumulation of "stuff" about the Negro. In so doing, Cunard sought to escape the privileged claustrophobia of her background through an identification with black diasporic and African cultures.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Collector
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Walter Benjamin argues that a collection tells more about the collector than about the objects themselves (<i>IL</i>, 59). The collector attempts to reconstruct a past that is lost in order to give meaning to his or her own sense of haphazardness in the present. A collector's mania reveals an excessive disorder, a "whimsicality" and arbitrariness, that serves as "the scene" and "the stage" in and on which to perform the fate of their objects, their final appropriation by the owner: "The period, the region, the craftsmanship, the former ownership&#x2014;for a true collector the whole background of an item adds up to a magic encyclopedia whose quintessence is the fate of his object" (<i>IL</i>, 60). The encyclopedic quality of a collection suggests a comprehensive yet contingent quality, marking a vanished past and attempting to fill in the present with found scraps of that hidden past. The collection provides a materialist history of the present, a collage that depends on the recontextualization and revision of a hidden past in order to construct a new kind of future.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  It fills in the present moment through reference to a vanished or nostalgic past that, if recontextualized and recirculated, might compose an alternative future to the ever-changing sameness under capitalism. One can witness this desire for an alternative to race relations and life more generally under capitalism in Cunard's paean to Harlem in <i>Negro, </i>"Harlem Reviewed": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Notice how many of the whites are unreal in America; they are <i>dim</i>. But the Negro is very real; he is <i>there</i>. And the ofays [whites] know it. That's why they come to Harlem&#x2014;out of curiosity and jealousy and don't-know-why. This desire to get close to the other race has often nothing honest about it. . . . This [spectacle of Negroes entertaining whites] 

<b></b>

applies of course to the mass of whites who treat Harlem in the same way that English toffs used to talk about 'going slumming.' The class I'm thinking of is 'the club-man.' They want entertainment.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In place of entertainment, Cunard finds the "restless, desire, brooding" of Harlem. She praises its nostalgia that articulates a "gorgeous roughness" composed of people in the street, their language and dress, and "the eternal radio seeping through everything day and night" (<i>N</i>, 73). In short, she discovers in black expressive culture the material and affective means of embracing an alternative class- and race-based relationship to modernity. Though primitivist, it provides both an imaginative and real means of rejecting bourgeois culture. </p>

<p>Cunard's scandalous desire for the "Negro" puts herself, as collector, into the picture. She crosses the boundary between bohemian slumming and something entirely else. Her intensely personal but very public rupture with her mother, for instance, that occasioned the 1931 pamphlet "Black Man and White Ladyship: an anniversary," broke the taboo of privacy by publicly exposing her mother's Anglo-American bigotry and hypocrisy. She combined matriphobia with radical politics to repudiate her class and race privilege, advocate racial justice, and critique British imperialism.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In the pamphlet, distributed to all of Cunard's friends and family (and a portion of it published in the<i> Crisis</i>), she refers to the Colour Question "with its CLASH or SHOCK aspect" as it generates hysteria in her mother (pamphlet, HRC, 1). Cunard writes, "she does not mind the Negroes now artistically or in an <i>abstract </i>sense but . . . oh, that terrible colour! (I invite Her Ladyship to send in writing a short definition of a Negro in the <i>abstract </i>sense)" (pamphlet, HRC, 3). Cunard's strategy against racism is to generate written commentary on "Colour." By documenting and collecting its material manifestation, she aims to concretize and show the lie of "race." </p>

<p>In a similar collecting fashion, her response to the press scandal that erupted while she was in Harlem gathering material for <i>Negro</i> was to invite the public to comment on why it was that Americans could not deal with race. On May 2, 1932, the New York <i>Daily Mirror </i>printed a story suggesting that Nancy Cunard came to Harlem to seduce Paul Robeson who was staying at the same hotel as she. Both Cunard and Robeson denied the story by telegram and when the story refused to die out, Cunard called a press conference. After discussing the purpose of her visit to Harlem, she asked:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And now after your interest in my private affairs (I hope I have sufficiently satisfied this) I want something in return. [. . .] <i>Why are you Americans so uneasy of the Negro race? </i>This question is the epitome of the whole colour question as it strikes a plain English person such as myself. Who'll write me the best answer to this? I'll print it in my book on Colour.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Eventually Cunard was forced to go into hiding on an upstate farm to escape constant press harassment. But in response to her query, she received approximately five hundred letters, among which two or three dozen contained obscenities and threats of abduction and violence. These letters, some of which Cunard reprinted in <i>Negro, </i>suggest the gender and sexual meanings read into her transgressive interest in "Negroes":

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I don't know what they call your kind in England but here in America they call them plain nigger fuckers or prostitutes of the lowest kind . . .</p>
<p>You dirty lowdown cocksucker, you are trying to convince the white race of NYC that you came here to write a book about the negro race, we know that you came here to suck the black pricks . . .</p>
<p>I feel certain that in the eyes of this world of white humanity, you Miss Nancy Cunard, are lower, [<i>sic</i>] than the lowest of prostitutes, in your phoney outbursts, and belley-hoo [<i>sic</i>] you are making since your arrival to this country. If you for one moment think that you are fooling the US people with your book writing pretext, you are mistaken . . . <sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">To be fair, Cunard also printed supportive letters by whites, including Southerners, thanking her for her work. But lest one thinks that Cunard's boundary crossing was a species of pure pleasure-mongering voyeurism, these letters alone testify to the political and social stakes of her work. In fact, Cunard received the fifteen hundred pounds needed to print one thousand copies of her anthology by Wishart and Co. in London through the proceeds of a successful libel trial conducted in England for the outraged accusations circulating in the British press over the alleged affair. (No damages were collected from the United States press). Literally, then, the anthology rests on the scandal of interracial desire.  </p>

<p>Cunard herself commented very little on the gender implications of the scandal. For her, the "sex scandal" is merely an effort to detract from antiracist work: "any interest manifested by a white person, even a foreigner to America (such as myself), is immediately transformed into a sex 'scandal'" (<i>N</i>, 197). She explains, "No chance is ever missed by the American press, and the type of American that believes it (vastly preponderant), to stir up as much fury as possible against Negroes and their white friends. To do this the sex motive is always used. As in the South it is always the lie of the 'rape' of white women by black men, so in the North it is always the so-called 'scandal' of inter-racial relations" (<i>N</i>, 197, see also <i>CL</i>, 86). Cunard extends the implications of the Scottsboro Case, perhaps following Ida B. Wells-Barnett's lead, to an analysis of how gender relations support race and class divisions wherever color and class lines exist, not merely in the South.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Black Transnationalism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Cunard's initial interest in race and class politics stemmed, in part, from her affiliation with surrealism and communism. Both groups in the early 1930s concerned themselves with anticolonial and antiracist struggles in order to contest colonization. The "elsewhere" they envisioned offered a disjunctive and space-clearing gesture through which, in <i>Negro</i>, a black revolutionary tradition could emerge within the interstices of white cosmopolitanism.  </p>

<p>The format of the anthology borrows from surrealist ethnography, a practice that displayed the irrationality of the primitive, the unconscious, and the mad. For surrealists, 

<b></b>

African and Oceanic artifacts, in particular, represented the farthest limits of human sensibility. Through encounters with the primitive, surrealism sought freedom from oppressive social constraints and freedom to imagine and enact the future differently. The juxtaposition between civilized and savage contested European taxonomies and hierarchies of value. Consider Cunard's 1931 plan for the anthology which promised to contain:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>1) The contemporary Negro in America, S. America, West Indies, Europe (writers, painters, musicians, and other artists and personalities). With photographs. 2) Musical section. Last century and modern American Negro compositions (Spirituals, Jazz, Blues, etc.)&#x2014;Reproduced. As much African tribal music as obtainable&#x2014;Reproduced. . . . 3) African. Ethnographical. Reproductions of African Art. Ivory Carvings, etc. Recent African photographs. 4) Political and sociological (the colonial system, Liberia, etc.) by French, English and American writers&#x2014;the French translated beside the original text.

Reproductions of Colored Advertisements. . . . </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Cunard's juxtaposition of celebrities, musical scores, African art, political and sociological analysis, poetry, and racist memorabilia lacks an overarching narrative. Like a scrapbook, it relies on the juxtaposition of many unrelated or loosely related materials. Similarly, surrealist ethnography uses montage-effects to defamiliarize everyday life and reveal unconscious taboos. In the technique of montage, contradictory materials (whether visual or verbal) are placed side by side and left unreconciled. There is no hierarchizing of significance. As a result, no one perspective can be said to dominate the others. The revolutionary energies provoked by surrealist techniques are not channeled into any authorizing practice but instead engage the reader to see the whole, including the gaps where difference exists without reconciliation and where translation produces misrecognition and the uncanny. It becomes an open-ended system. There is no subordination of one perspective into a single dominant perspective.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Walter Benjamin, who was influenced by surrealist techniques, said that montage had "special, perhaps even total rights" as a progressive form because it "interrupts the context into which it is inserted."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  It lacks a unifying argument and instead threatens to burst the confines of any form and normalizing context.  </p>

<p>But more than merely deconstructing European modernity, surrealist ethnography began to move away from primitivism <i>tout court </i>towards an affiliation with anticolonial and workers' movements. The relation between surrealism and communism in the service of African and African-diasporic history is a fascinating conjunction between avant-garde aesthetic practices and global anti-imperialism. Communism in the 1920s and early 1930s explicitly promoted a doctrine of anti-imperialism. But by 1935, the Communist Party made antifascist initiatives their focus and let anti-imperialist concerns dwindle in importance. However, their backing of anti-imperialist organizations before 1935 was groundbreaking. For instance, they supported anti-imperialist proposals within colonizing countries. The Resolution of the Communist International on the "Negro Question in the United States," cited in <i>Negro,</i> declared that "these social 

<b></b>

antagonisms [the remnants of slavery] stink of the disgusting atmosphere of the old slave market. This is downright robbery and slave-whipping barbarism at the peak of capitalist 'culture'" (<i>N</i>, 229).  </p>

<p>The Communist International also organized worldwide conferences of African leaders. It recognized the successes of the Universal Negro Improvement Association under Marcus Garvey as well as the Pan-African Congresses organized by W. E. B. Du Bois. One of its international conferences, held in Brussels in 1927, included future nationalist leaders Jomo Kenyatta (a contributor to <i>Negro</i>) and Jawaharlal Nehru. The Congress made important steps in coordinating various struggles for national liberation in the colonies and passed a resolution that proclaimed, "Africa for the Africans, and their full freedom and equality with other races and the right to govern Africa."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Comintern's resolutions regarding the right to self-determination of black peoples, including those in the Southern United States and South Africa, affirmed that "Black people had their own unique revolutionary tradition" (<i>HPR</i>, 107).  </p>

<p>This pronouncement, of course, was <i>not</i> news to black people. Prior to, but also mobilized through this affirmation, African and African-diasporic writers had recovered a worldwide black revolutionary tradition within modernity, but distinct from European traditions. Brent Edwards defines this tradition as both transnational and  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>molded through attempts to appropriate and transform the discourses of internationalism . . . the discourse of international civil society as embodied by the League of Nations, the counter-universalism of proletarian revolution envisioned by the Communist International, and the globe-carving discourse of European colonialism. </p>

<p class="continued">Drawing its ideas from pan-Africanist and communist anti-imperialism, black transnationalism borrowed, to varying extents, from communism, European liberalism, and black vernacular traditions. Contributors to <i>Negro </i>such as George Padmore, James W. Ford, and W. E. B. Du Bois affirmed a long history of black resistance, from Toussaint L'Ouverture in Haiti to Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, and Gabriel Prosser in the United States and to the contemporary and controversial Haile Sellasie in Ethiopia. And contributors recovered the history of African civilizations, the slave trade, and slave resistance articulated in and against white-defined modernity. This recovery of black history and cultures had enormous impact on the transvaluation of racial identities and was a significant element of <i>Negro</i>'s aims. Moreover, <i>Negro</i> united across cultural and linguistic barriers a worldwide racial identity, a move that somewhat opened the idea of "race" to historical and geographical contingency without necessarily challenging racial difference itself. <i>Negro </i>articulated the underside of global imperialism, the experience of multiple local histories interwoven into a provisional and transnational identity, that of the Negro. For instance, Gordon O. Bell, in an article in <i>Negro</i> entitled "The Negro in Barbados," indicates the instability and incommensurability of the term "Negro":  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is a definite dissimilarity between the American and the West Indian interpretation of the term "Negro." In America the definition is universally applied to those persons who are not 100 per cent. white; in the West Indies it is apparently reserved for those who are 

<b></b>

100 per cent. black. Indeed it is noticeable that in the society of people of Negro descent the word seems taboo, and is religiously eschewed, the term "colored" being used to classify the multiplicity of shades existing between the pure white and the pure black. To call the average colored West Indian a Negro is to affront him . . . </p>

<p class="continued">Reading across the discontinuities of diasporic and African locations in <i>Negro</i>&#x2014;from the Congo, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya, West Africa, Uruguay, Brazil, British Guiana, Trinidad, Cuba, Grenada, Jamaica, Haiti, Europe and the United States&#x2014;produces a pragmatics of race that is performative. That is, these racial identities are not prelinguistic givens; rather, they are citations of previous scripts. <i>Negro</i>'s boundaries and meanings are contingent and contested rather than, as often occurs in nationalist formations, metaphysical and fixed. The anthology requires that readers move between multiple temporalities (the old in the new) and between multiple locations and perspectives, including racist attitudes and European cosmopolitanism. This reading practice is mobile, improvisational, openended, and importantly critiques the racial ground of the modern to which I shall return below.  </p>

<p>But do these historical perspectives eliminate the colonizing dangers of cosmopolitanism? In <i>Negro, </i>Cunard's cosmopolitan perspective and interests infuse the anthology. Her editorial comments are interspersed among contributions, hierarchizing the interpretation of its contents despite the anthology's montage form. (For instance, Du Bois's affiliation with the NAACP is condemned for catering to the bourgeois class.) Many of the white contributors (William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robert Goffin) universalize their point of view, relegating Negroes to objects of history. In the Africa section, Cunard displays her bracelet collection to which she adds a contextualizing caption that discusses the significance of the bracelets for Ibo women in Nigeria: "With the older women these ivories are priceless treasures, and they will endure any hardships in preference to degrading themselves by selling them, however great the inducement may be" (<i>N</i>, 731). Cunard's caption alludes to the suffering that allowed these bracelets to come into her possession. Is she indifferent or unaware of the irony of this? Or perhaps she attempted to exorcise this past when she staged her infamous bondage photos in which the primitive beads she wears threaten to choke her (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Jane Marcus's incisive reading of Cunard's staging of herself as a "white Negress" asks whether  </p>

<p class="continued">If one considers <i>Negro</i>'s documentary project as a whole, its aim is clearly to make visible exactly this sort of suffering in order to foster anti-imperialist and antiracist sentiments and action. The scale of one's interpretation defines how to judge <i>Negro</i>. The anthology,

<b></b>

 as Cunard envisioned it, was to be a "symposium" for the ways in which "colour" is handled. The anthology frames "race"&#x2014;here I borrow from George Hutchinson's analysis of <i>The New Negro </i>anthology&#x2014;as "a field of commerce and conflict."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Dismissing the most flagrant aspect of this conflict, critical appraisals of <i>Negro</i> tend to downplay Cunard's communist pronouncements (cf. <i>HDF, PD</i>). These appraisals are in part correct given that Cunard was never politically active in the Communist Party or in any other political organization. Nonetheless, Cunard draws on communism as a unifying and militant force that rejects capitalist universalism and promises social and political equality for blacks. In the preface to <i>Negro, </i>Cunard proclaims that "The Communist world-order is the solution of the race problem for the Negro" and she praises the virtues of the Soviet Union and its race relations (<i>N</i>, iii). It has, she confidently asserts, "once and for all solved the 'problem' of races, turning instilled conflicts into co-operation, wiping out the false concept of 'inferiority'" (<i>N</i>, iv). In one contribution to <i>Negro, </i>for example, surrealist Georges Sadoul compares French and Soviet children's cartoons in order to show French imperial versus Soviet egalitarian (though paternalist) race relations (<i>N</i>, 573).

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>For my purposes, far more important than speculations about what the Soviet Union may have accomplished (and did not) in terms of race relations, is the appeal of revolutionary rupture to open the present moment to alternative visions and possibilities outside of European cosmopolitanism. Cunard's preface concludes with a call, "The White Man is Killing Africa!" She elaborates, "I have ended it [the Anthology] on this <i>note, </i>for the chord of oppression, struggle and protest rings, trumpet-like or muffled, but always insistent throughout" (<i>N</i>, iv). The chord, collective, often dissonant, strikes one note and is held "throughout," extending the present moment to reconceptions of history. In this revisioning of history through recourse to an "elsewhere," avant-garde rupture shares affinities with the discontinuous history of the black diaspora.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The alternative history of transnational affiliation that is articulated through revolutionary rupture gives rise to a new politics of reading, one that interrupts cosmopolitan appropriation of other cultures by means of an alternative tradition of resistance. This note might, at first glance, appear to participate in an imperialist nostalgia, what Caren Kaplan describes as a remorse for the cultures and environments being destroyed by modernity even while continuing the same practices.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But even as Cunard romanticizes the vanishing African- and African-diasporic ways of life, she refuses European modernity that colonizes these cultures and argues instead for an alternative modernity based on black transnationalism. <i>Negro</i>'s exhaustive statistical documentation of atrocities committed by Europeans across the African continent<i>&#x2014;</i>of the division and theft of land, onerous taxation, forced labor in which workers die of hunger and exhaustion, the conscription of African soldiers to European armies, police and judicial repression, genocide, the decimation of traditions&#x2014;views the history of Western political thought and practice through the perspective of Africa, its constitutive outside.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Cunard's rejection of capitalist modernity operated in the best traditions of avant-garde modernism. She recalled "the indignation, the fury, the disgust, the contempt, the longing to t" over the color bar and all it stood for that motivated <i>Negro </i>(1964 letter to Hugh Ford HRHRC). Rejecting the historical present that created the segregation and class oppression of black people, she presents her anthology as a founding moment of modernism. Her 1931 circular, which announces the formation of a book on Colour (<i>Negro</i>'s first title), asks for "outspoken criticism." She envisions the collection as an antibourgeois gesture and promises that this will be "the first time such a book has been compiled in this manner. It is primarily for Coloured people and it is dedicated to one of them. I wish by their aid to make it as inclusive as possible" (HRC). By all estimations, Cunard successfully published what all anthologies are: events. They make history by their very publication and they repeat other histories as they script their intervention. (As indicated earlier, however, the critical reception of an anthology conditions the extent to which that history is made or forgotten.) Cunard's call for contributions, written in 1931, produces a scaffolding of future expectations of what the anthology will be. She proclaims: "I want outspoken criticism, comment and comparison from the Negro on the present-day civilisations of Europe, American, South America, the West Indies, African Colonies, etc. . . . individual documents, letters, photographs from those that have travelled and can judge of the attitude of diverse countries and races" (HRC). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This founding moment of the anthology has prompted literary scholars to call this circular a manifesto.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  It presents a prefatory explanation of new art and literature by an emergent group. The anthology becomes the realization of the manifesto. As in typical modernist ruptures, other anthologies (such as <i>The New Negro </i>and <i>Fire!!</i>) are by default declared superseded in favor of the "new" anthology. Cunard announces that the anthology will be "the first" of its kind and originary in scope. Indeed, the scope of <i>Negro</i>, with its painful, unsettling documentation of forced labor, chain gangs, the middle passage, slave resistance, lynching, and poverty enacts what Neil Lazarus has called modernism's absolute refusal to accommodate itself to modernity as it exists: "what at least some modernist work has done from the outset: namely, says 'no'; refuses integration, resolution, consolation, comfort; [it] protests and criticizes."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Modernism's refusal to cooperate with bourgeois modernity finds its critical and historical edge in <i>Negro</i>.  </p>

<p>The energy of rupture functions as a space-clearing gesture that allows modernity to be revised through an African and African diasporic perspective. In order to contextualize and revise Negro identity, the ground of white liberalism needed to be excavated as well. Some contributors to <i>Negro </i>subjected the contradictions and hypocrisies of a universalized European history to critical scrutiny. For example, the surrealist manifesto in <i>Negro</i>, "Murderous Humanitarianism," signed by Andr&#x00E9; Breton, Roger Caillois, Pierre Unik, Benjamin P&#x00E9;ret, Ren&#x00E9; Char, Ren&#x00E9; Crevel, Paul Eluard, Martiniquans J. M. Monnerot, and Pierre Yoyotte, targets "counterfeit liberalism" with its notions of progress: "It is no good blustering about the Antilles and the 'happy evolution' that has enabled them [blacks of the Antilles] to be assimilated, or very nearly, by France" (<i>N</i>, 574). In place of such ameliorism, the surrealists declare "<i>Revolution first and always</i>" (<i>N</i>, 574). This break from continuous, reformist discourse for the surrealists occurs not simply by ushering in the "new" but by staging a confrontation between the familiarity with France and its strange territories with which it is more than ever closely entwined. Rather than using the colonies and colonial display to normalize European modernity (as did, for instance, the International Colonial Exhibition of Paris, held in 1931), the surrealists confronted European narcissistic self-satisfactions. They did this much as they organized their exhibit protesting the Colonial Exhibition, called "The Truth about the Colonies." In "The Truth about the Colonies" the surrealists articulated a crisis of modernity as they punctured the smooth unfolding of modern time with the assemblages of tribal objects, polemical graphics, and Western religious objects resignified as the fetishized ritual artifacts of Catholicism.  </p>

<p>The surrealist manifesto also displaces the spatial and temporal ordering of modernity to bring the shock of anticolonial war to France. They announce: "We Surrealists pronounced ourselves [in response to the 1925 French war against Morocco] in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war" (<i>N</i>, 574). This civil war interrupts self-glorification and self-identity. Describing France as "hideously inflated from having dismembered Europe, made mincemeat of Africa, polluted Oceania and ravaged whole tracts of Africa," the surrealists reject an abstract universal (France as harbinger of liberty, equality, and fraternity) and instead make concrete a gluttonous, butchering France "hideously inflated" and morally corrupt&#x2014;descriptions 

<b></b>

that match those often used to describe the colonial "problem" (<i>N</i>, 574). The terrain of the world is cannibalized by France. The surrealists' revision of national mythology attempts to alter narratives of modernity where civilized men travel to savage territories. Similarly, their strategy in the "Truth about the Colonies" Exhibit contests the colonial order of things through the montage of tribal and modern artifacts. </p>

<p>The moment's urgency in the manifesto is underscored by a photograph of a "Colonial Negro tailor in a small factory in France" (<i>N</i>, 575). This shot is still and dark; it gives a sense of waiting but its calm, smooth detachment also contrasts with the manic and barbaric excesses of France. It positions the "colonial negro" squarely in modernity (in the factory) and as a force of revolution. The photograph provides a sense of lived immediacy and contact with the physical presence of the colonial suffering in the center of empire. Yet inscribed as a photographic image, he speaks of a present moment lost forever. The unfulfilled need for redemption might potentially be altered in the present moment of revolutionary change. The present is pregnant with anticipated change, thickened but also haunted by a past of unredeemed suffering. Lived experience expands to take in the waiting of the black proletariat and the expectation that modernity will arise from that location, as the manifesto states, as a "torrent of those energies . . . will close over [the Frenchman's] head" (<i>N</i>, 575). Benjamin, in his essay on surrealism, locates revolutionary potential in what might otherwise appear to be the detritus of modernity. I suggest that the surrealists aimed at targeting this potential in the contingent photo of the black worker. Benjamin writes: "Only when in technology body and image so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily collective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the collective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended itself to the extent demanded by <i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>"<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  While these beliefs in the revolutionary potential of the Negro may be romanticized&#x2014;the Negro is believed to be elsewhere&#x2014;and thus surrealism participates in an exoticized primitivism, there is also the uncanny presence of the familiar and ordinary in the photograph. Subjects such as the black tailor might be said to dream a future revolution that never came, what Langston Hughes calls "dreams deferred" or Michael Hanchard calls a "futures past" in need of redemption.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The lost present becomes an aspect of the future anterior, a past event whose promise can only be fulfilled in the future and which renders the present incomplete. </p>

<p>The archival materials in <i>Negro</i> generate such revolutionary discharge by transforming the historical constraints of global capitalism that position black workers into slave-wage jobs into a discontinuous but unified worldwide anti-imperialist force. This force includes those forgotten in the past. <i>Negro </i>contains many references to these occluded subjects. In John L. Spivak's essay in <i>Negro, </i>"Flashes from Georgia Chain Gangs," he scours the files of the Georgia prison system: "the pathetic letters from convicts complaining of cruelty and barbarity, the doctors' reports on sickness and injuries and deaths, the punishment reports&#x2014;those little slips of paper gathering dust that told the stories of hopeless lives" (<i>N</i>, 211). Letters such as this one from Eugene Brown, sent from Gwinnett County on May 2, 1931:

<p class="continued">This latent possibility haunts the still image of the black tailor and the desperate appeal of Eugene Brown in the Georgia chain gang. The patchwork assemblage of <i>Negro</i> articulates nostalgia, and loss as well as revolutionary resistance.  </p>

<p>One can still point to the revolutionary romanticism of surrealist readings of the black proletariat. They impute to the "negro" tailor a subversive intent merely because he is marginal. But the same cannot be said of the manifesto reprinted in the "Africa" section of <i>Negro. </i>It circulated in the Belgian Congo and takes the form of Engel's early version of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, that of catechism or dialogue, between a na&#x00EF;ve worker and a politicized organizer. For instance, the first question "<i>What is a Negro?</i>" is answered: "A Negro is a man like any other, whose skin is black as the skin of Europeans is white and that of Arabs is brown" (<i>N</i>, 794). Race is a particularity that fails to negate the universality of the Negro subject as a "man." The next question is: "<i>Are Negroes treated like men in the Congo?</i>' 'No, in the Congo Negroes are treated as beasts and often worse than beasts.' '<i>Give an example of this</i>.' 'A dog can go into a white man's caf&#x00E9;, club, cinema, or house. A Negro cannot," (<i>N</i>, 794). A crucial difference between the surrealist and Belgian Congo manifestos is one of uneven development in modernity, the need to simultaneously critique modernity and nation-building in one location, France, and embrace it in the Congo. In the 1931 surrealist manifesto "First Appraisal of the Colonial Exhibition," the surrealists state that "just as the opponents of nationalism have the duty to defend the nationalism of oppressed peoples, so the opponents of that art which is the fruit of capitalist economy also have the duty to place the arts of oppressed people dialectically in opposition to it."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In an engagement with Marxist thought as a solution to the problem of colonization, the 

<b></b>

black/white or first/third world divide is baldly dialectical. The contradictions are not deconstructed, at least not until synthesis becomes possible. Instead, the surrealists embrace the paradox of being against one form of social organization, nationalism, for their own location and supportive of it for the colonies. The Congo manifesto, too, demands nation-building and an increased engagement with modernity. It lists workers', soldiers', and villagers' demands:  </p>

<p class="continued">The manifesto demands action to build a practical consciousness of a black revolution under way. It does this by exposing the contradictions of imperialism and directing action towards the means of achieving unity, rights, and sovereignty. The Congo manifesto incorporates Marxist demands for better labor conditions with human rights and Kimbanguism, an indigenous millenarian religious movement led by Simon Kimbangu. Kimbangu combined Protestantism with ancient Congo ideas concerning the organization of the universe and urged against witchcraft and magic and for the restoration of moral order. He miraculously healed the sick and dying and preached anticolonialism. Arrested in September 1921 for subversion, he died in prison thirty years later, yet the church he founded thrives today in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p>

<i>Negro </i>and the Racial Ground of the Modern
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>This final section explores further the notion of uneven temporalities in <i>Negro. </i>It considers how black modernity is articulated within the amorphous, discontinuous materials of the anthology. Theodore Mason calls the publication of anthologies of underrepresented peoples, "both text and event," a literary production carrying extra literary weight that makes visible the process by which a community "represent[s] and codif[ies] in a formal way the history of its own expressivity."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The intention of the anthology, Cunard claims, is to speak from within and to a newly visible collective 

<b></b>

("coloured people") who announce their presence and engagement in modernity. This effort is necessarily belated given that modernity has long been articulated as a European-centered phenomena. This very belatedness then becomes performative, a reiteration of previous scripts. The time lag of modernity indicates modernity in all its global complexity, the articulations "structured in dominance" that comprise modernity.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  <i>Negro,</i> as Brent Edwards has argued, articulates "over and over again" the link "between politics and performance" (<i>PD</i>, 317). And, so, I wish to think of <i>Negro </i>in light of its performative effects articulated through the lens of black modernity. Its performativity opens historicism to overlooked histories of blacks in the New World, biographies of uncanonized black authors, and subaltern experiences within the imperial center (the U.S., Britain and France) and throughout the black Atlantic and Africa. <i>Negro </i>testifies to the way in which avant-garde rupture can open the present moment to the forgotten histories and peoples disavowed but present in modernity. These forgotten histories critique European-centered modernity as they present alternative forms of black modernism.  </p>

<p>This politics of reading is not straightforward. Rather, it is angled, asymmetrical, and refracted through black relations to the white world. Consider Alain Locke's congratulations to Cunard on the publication of her anthology: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . I congratulate you,&#x2014;almost enviously, on the finest anthology in every sense of the word ever compiled on the Negro. When I saw the announcements, I feared a scrap book, but by a miracle of arrangement, you have built up a unity of effect and a subtle accumulative force of enlightenment that is beyond all contradiction and evasion. </p>

<p class="continued">Rather than the unwieldy failure ("a scrap book") that <i>Negro</i> is often taken for, Locke emphasizes "unity of effect," a delayed force that achieves its ends through the slow, "subtle" prism of black modernity. Here, the term "scrap book" might mean a collection of unrelated fragments, but Locke realized, as we might today, that these disparate pieces build a sense of unity in difference, a transnational allegiance against racism. Moreover, its "accumulative force" of meaning depends upon its readers' experiential encounter with it. Nowhere is this more evident in <i>Negro </i>than in its diverse musical scores (folk tunes like "Cricket Gills and Dried Barnabis," "Congo Songs," and "Negro protest songs") that demand its readers' participation to make meaning. One needs to "play" or "hum" <i>Negro. </i>By "arrangement," each article, photo, and poem contributes to a heterogeneous, fissured understanding of the black diaspora. Brent Edwards suggests a politics of reading diaspora as that which navigates the "break" modeled by <i>Negro</i>'s very difficulties and discontinuities. Reading across such discrepancies, he argues, negotiates the condition of the African diaspora, its demand for translations across modernity (<i>PD</i>, 13). And, I would add, that attention to occluded histories revises our concept of avant-garde rupture&#x2014;not as clean break from the past&#x2014;but rather, as a "reration of temporality" that opens the present moment to its radical incompleteness, its "time out of joint."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Negro</i> was deeply invested not only in breaking from narratives of Western progress and bourgeois complacency but in presenting an alternative history, that of color. This crossing and recrossing the expanse of modernity, I suggest, opens the present moment to a "future anterior." Aldon Nielsen glosses such temporality as follows:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In order for intellectuals of the African diaspora to posit New World Africans as progenitors of modernity, in order for us, now, to follow them in thinking of African peoples as not simply subjects encompassed by modernity but as active producers of the modern, we must have modernity already there before us, and this is why all such writings are haunted by a 'post-' and why all such histories must immediately be seen as revisionist.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This temporality, he adds, accounts for why African-American modernity is usually posited as a "counter" or "alternative" modernity that joins a singular modernity with a particularly disjunctive cultural crossing.  </p>

<p>Modernity must have already been in place in order for "us" to recognize its counterculture. Zora Neale Hurston, foregrounded prominently in <i>Negro, </i>affirms this temporality in her essay, "Characteristics of Negro Expression." She first acknowledges the Negro's belated position in narratives of modernity. She admits that the Negro is often said to be "lacking in originality," hence incapable of the "new" and of doing anything but mimicking the white man (<i>N</i>, 42). Then, Hurston spins this time lag around to make this mimicry constitutive of black modernity: "While [the Negro] lives and moves in the midst of a white civilisation, everything he touches is re-interpreted for his own use. He has modified the language, mode of food preparation, practice of medicine, and most certainly the religion of his new country, just as he adapted to suit himself the Sheik hair-cut made famous by Rudolph Valentino" (<i>N</i>, 43). This resignification actively constitutes black "experience" as different from everyday dominant modes of perception in modernity. It opens the present by bringing together fragments of discarded and overlooked materials&#x2014;remnants of black life: hieroglyphic language; active, emotive religious customs; and geographical/racial identification (a black man sporting a Sheik hair-cut). But rather than inscribing these remnants onto a premodern past, Hurston demands that they be understood as a confrontation of dominant narratives of modernity in the present moment.  </p>

<p>For instance, she asserts that Negro folklore is "not a thing of the past" but still in the making: "Its great variety shows the adaptation of the black man: nothing is too old or too new, domestic or foreign, high or low, for his use. God and the Devil are paired, and are treated no more reverently than Rockefeller and Ford" (<i>N</i>, 42). The bricoleur is detached from sacred narratives of nation, class, culture and religious cosmology. He resignifies these disparate fragments in new forms. The aesthetic aura (of detached, ritualistic art forms) disappears as Hurston positions black folk culture as an avant-garde undoing of modernity's empty, futile forms. What could be more modernist, capable of grasping the contingent and ephemeral, the exotic and the detritus of modernity, than a black painter of modern life?  </p>

<p>More than effecting a transvaluation of black culture, Hurston undermines the racialized ground of the modern. She demonstrates how black resignification has been 

<b></b>

adopted by white culture as the sign of the modern and repeated with a difference. As blacks adapt whites' musical instruments to their own ends, those modifications are adopted by the white man himself and then reinterpreted. Hurston glosses this dizzying exchange as follows: "Paul Whiteman is giving an imitation of a Negro orchestra making use of white-invented musical instruments in a Negro way" (<i>N</i>, 43). Hurston's <i>mise en abyme </i>of performing racial difference, as Michael North has noted, is more than turning the tables on white judgments of Negro mimicry. Rather, North says, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>it is precisely because it [Negro art] is already imitative that it cannot be further imitated. It is precisely the self-conscious awareness, the ironic indirection, of black art and language that makes it original and impossible to mimic. White performers, because they are unself-conscious, na&#x00EF;ve, and obsessed with a false concept of originality, are helpless to rival the race they long to emulate.</p>

<p class="continued">While white modernity has long sought representations of blackness to affirm the modernism of their art, blacks have reinterpreted these representations of themselves, and so folded the linear temporality of the modern into a "post" within black modernity, a future anterior.  </p>

<p><i>Negro </i>dismantles the racial subtext of the modern from the opposite direction as well. The surrealist Ren&#x00E9; Crevel's surrogate essay, "The Negress in the Brothel," is omitted from the table of contents of <i>Negro.</i> Fearing censorship due to the explicit language and content in this essay, Cunard printed the essay separately through the Utopia Press in London and inserted it without page numbers into the anthology (its Roman numerals I, II, III mark the gap). It both literally and ratively articulates a gap between an erotic desire for interracial intimacy and how that desire is manifested within modernity's racial organization. It names within this overlooked location the repressed black female sexuality erased by Cunard's attention to white women's liaisons with black men. Crevel names the fetish of race as the enabling condition of modernism and locates its formative moment in Baudelaire's poetry: "<i>Charme inattendu d'un bijou rose et noir</i>: Baudelaire adores the dark flesh of Jeanne Duval" (<i>N</i>, II). The structure of this relationship, Crevel writes, is akin to "the Taylor system with division of labor [<i>sic</i>]" (<i>N</i>, II). </p>

<p>Moreover, the brothel and drawing room mutually constitute each other in modernity, the brothel compensating for the alienation attendant among stifling bourgeois society: "But even when for one reason or another [the Frenchman] is obliged to remain at home [rather than in the colonies] he demands to be entertained and debauched by the exotic curiosity that lifts him clear of the national fact into an illusion of renewal" (<i>N</i>, III). Interracial intimacy cannot be achieved in this scenario; it, too, is a product of the same forces that create modernity's abstractions of labor, exchange, and ideas, the Taylorization of work, and, here, of consumption. Modernity creates the spectacle of race, a "scenic organisation," in which the "object of desire has become an object in the d&#x00E9;cor of desires" (<i>N</i>, III). The black prostitute is seen indirectly, through a racial organization of society. The gutter, the inadmissible, the venal are inscribed onto the "erotic machinery" of Baudelaire's relationship with Jeanne Duval. As such, Crevel accuses

<b></b>

 Baudelaire of anticipating reprisals from critics who would depreciate his "liaison with this whore" and making fine poetry from the dilemma. The structure of sadism and superiority represented in this relationship demonstrate, he writes, a "hypocritical servility before things as they are" (<i>N</i>, II). This servility to the racial organization of modernity produces not only the means by which modernism constitutes itself in relation to alterity but also, Crevel will insist, that it contributes to the eroticized <i>mise en sc&#x00E8;ne</i> by which white audiences gaze at black entertainers: "Hence the popularity of Martinique jazz, Cuban melodies, Harlem bands and the entire tam-tam of the Colonial Exhibition" (<i>N</i>, III). White modernity, as it partakes of a racial obsession with alterity, realizes itself in commodified black entertainment.  </p>

<p>Puncturing this reified, sterile structure of white voyeurism of blacks, Hurston resignifies black performance as akin to the dandy in its self-as-spectacle.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Like Baudelaire's self-fashioning as fl&#x00E2;neur, which Benjamin calls "a publicity stunt" necessitated by the poet's "loss of halo," the dandy signals the cancelled distance of the aura. The disenchantment of art necessitates for Baudelaire an "exhibit of his own person <i>on the market</i>."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  So, too, black performance presents the commodification of self, a construction of black identity for white onlookers. Hurston asks her audience: "Who has not observed a robust young Negro chap posing upon a street corner, possessed of nothing but his clothing, his strength and his youth? Does he bear himself like a pauper? No, Louis XIV could be no more insolent in his assurance" (<i>N</i>, 39). Though Hurston likens the dandy to the French aristocracy in his coldness and pride of bearing, she domesticates him within a heteronormative structure of reproduction: this dandy has a female counterpart: "A Negro girl strolls past the corner lounger. Her whole body panging and posing. . . . A hippy undulation below the waist that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power. She is acting out 'I'm a darned sweet woman and you know it'" (<i>N</i>, 39). They betray what Baudelaire would call a "characteristic quality of opposition and revolt": that which is "finest in human pride, of that compelling need . . . of combating and destroying triviality." He calls this a "native energy," a "new kind of aristocracy," the "last spark of heroism amid decadence."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Effecting detachment through their self-creation, Hurston's black fl&#x00E2;neurs inject desire into a black modernity: "These little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities, and no one ever mistakes the meaning" (<i>N</i>, 39).  </p>

<p>In narrating these scenes as performance, Hurston draws attention to their status as collective ritual. Negro expression, Hurston contends, is a communal art. It is an active constitution of the everyday as "experience," of intimacy blended with detachment that produces a conscious self-creation whose meaning will only be completed by the audience. Negro art, because its possibilities can only be realized through its "beholders," proves, in Hurston's estimation, their superiority in art from whites. She explains: "The difference in the two arts is this: the white dancer attempts to express fully; the Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests" (<i>N</i>, 41&#x2013;2). Negro dancing is "dynamic suggestion" that "gives the impression that the dancer will do more." The dancer assumes a pose of flexed knees and a ferocious face and "thrusts the upper part of the body forward with clenched fists, 

<b></b>

elbows taut as in hard running or grasping a thrusting blade. That is all." The spectator, on the other hand, "adds the picture of ferocious assault, hears the drums and finds himself keeping time with the music and tensing himself for the struggle. . . . That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt. He is participating in the performance himself&#x2014;carrying out the suggestions of the performer" (<i>N</i>, 41). The dialogics of art, the experience of imagining its possibilities, transforming the everyday into a jungle fantasia, opens the present moment to its political unconscious, those narratives that legitimize colonization. Rather than promoting romantic subjectivity&#x2014;the expressive individual self, articulated in and through an autonomous aesthetic&#x2014;Hurston's anthropological vision situates the Negro within a community with which he interacts, the objective social world. Hurston posits Negro expression as sensual and material, that is discontinuous with the present and that reformulates modern life through the prism of black performativity. As such, it forms a characteristically avant-garde reration of temporality. It injects into modern life new modes of sentiment and an "elsewhere," both part of and "post" modernity.  </p>

<p>Specifically, the black diasporic writers in the collection offer what Paul Gilroy calls "a counterculture of modernity," based on performative interruption of the smooth narrative unfolding of modern time (<i>BA</i>, 38&#x2013;40). In this "counterculture of modernity," we can see "the future oriented present" of black diasporic modernism as giving rise to "culturally distinctive innovations" that are "historically redemptive of a sense of past."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  <i>Negro,</i> as a "booklike creation from a fringe area," is a border document in the best sense, one that generates new ways of imagining how modernism travels: its gaps, discontinuities, conflicts and historical differences. In articulating a black transnationalism as a counter to capitalist imperialism, <i>Negro</i>'s scrapbook format challenges racial and class hierarchies, offering in their stead a way of linking together African and black diasporic experiences through the context of a counter-modernity.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT3" href="#REF3">3</a>. <i>The New York </i>Times, April 13, 1934. The <i>Crisis </i>as well as left-leaning journals such as the<i> Liberator </i>and <i>New Masses </i>did not review <i>Negro. </i>Henry Lee Moon, who in 1965 became the editor of the<i> Crisis </i>and Director of Public Relations for the NAACP, praised <i>Negro</i> in both the<i> New Republic </i>and the <i>Amsterdam News,</i> calling it a distinguished contribution to the "world literature of the black race" (<i>New Republic</i> October 24, 1934). The<i> Afro-American </i>ambivalently called the volume "one of the most pretentious and inclusive of any ever published" and noted that "much of [Cunard's] material 

<b></b>

on injustices to the colored man is taken from the weekly press," the very press that Cunard maligned in <i>Negro</i>&#x2014;along with Harlem cliques, the NAACP and Du Bois&#x2014;for catering too much to the white establishment (March 31, 1934). But contributor Arturo Schomburg who reviewed <i>Negro </i>for the Associated Negro Press which was distributed to 300 Negro papers around the United States, enthused: "Within the plethora of pages is encompassed a miniature world where all important happening to the Negroes whose descendents are now portrayed giving articulation to the cultural side for the world to see the bitter feeling in the human machinery of evolution, in its inflexible work." And he recommended its purchase to libraries: "The anthology is here in time to fill a needed and necessary space in our libraries, for its exhaustive illustrations of African sculpture taken from the various great Museums of Europe; for its excellent pictures of people and places; for its peaceful tone and beautiful forms of the printers art and craft. . . . We are highly indebted and express our keen delight for the unselfish contribution on the part of Nancy Cunard, to the cause of the downtrodden lowest man, in helping him to see the light on the road of human emancipation" (HRC). Contributor Eugene Gordon recollected that the anthology was most frequently criticized at the time of its publication for being too wide in scope and too varied in content and, surprisingly, that Cunard had ignored black women and youth. This latter criticism, Gordon felt, was due to fallout from her sexual relationships with black men and the lurid gossip that surrounded her. Problems with <i>Negro </i>at the time of publication stemmed from Cunard's communist leanings and interracial sexual relations, not from her primitivism and racial essentialism (Marcus, 1995, makes this case extensively).  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>Further praise for <i>Negro</i> came from other black writers who contributed to it. Langston Hughes cabled Cunard immediately with the message: "Your book is marvelous." He maintained a thirty year friendship with her and continued to praise the volume, borrowing from its folklore section for his 1960 anthology, <i>An African Treasury</i> (Langston Hughes Collection, Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University). Jazz pianist Henry Crowder, Cunard's first black lover to whom <i>Negro </i>is dedicated, enthused, "The gratitude of the Negro race is yours, and the admiration of all people of every race who believe in justice." Crowder would later retract his praise in his memoir <i>As Wonderful as That? </i>William Pickens of the NAACP, Alain Locke, John Frederick Mathews, Taylor Gordon, Josephine Schuyler and Eugene Gordon also wrote privately to Cunard to comment favorably on the volume. Taylor Gordon called it "the talk of the country" and a textbook for students who are inclined to "think black" (HRC). Nigerian contributor T.K. Utchay named his daughter Nancy and a school he founded the Cunardia School in her honor. Hugh D. Ford, introduction to <i>Negro: An Anthology</i>, by Nancy Cunard, ed. and abridged by Hugh D. Ford (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1970), xxvii; hereafter abbreviated as <i>HDF</i>. More recently, a former student of C. L. R. James, Aldon Nielsen, remembers that James owned a copy of <i>Negro</i> "and often showed [it] to his students in later decades." <i>C. L. R.. James: A Critical Introduction</i> (Jackson: Mississippi University Press, 1997), 170.

<p><a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>. Historian Gary Wilder provides a good basis for understanding this phenomenon. These diverse transnational populations, he writes, "spread across disjunctive territories and [are] subject to diverse regimes of governance." Further, these "transnational forms of identification become a modality through which to participate in national politics of an imperial power" . Wilder demonstrates, in particular, how 1930s French Republicanism and Pan-Africanism entailed one another. For instance, Wilder reports that "numerous black organizations participated in the mid-1930s Popular Front mobilization in defense of the national republic." Cunard, he says, was also there and wrote that colonial groups not only rallied for the republic but chanted slogans such as "Africa for the Africans" and carried banners that said "Equal Rights and Equal Status for North African and Colonial Workers," or "t Mussolini's Aggression on Ethiopia."

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. Jane Marcus's groundbreaking work on <i>Negro</i> defends "its unique place as a biracial text" . She argues that we should "read <i>Negro </i>as creating a cross-cultural and cross-racial contact zone that connects Harlem and Paris with Zimbabwe and Haiti, Alabama and Brazil with lynching in America, 

<b></b>

and the history of African art with hundreds [of] drawings and photographs" so that "it will perhaps emerge with all its contradictions intact as a way of understanding race relations in Europe and the black Atlantic between the wars." Jane Marcus, <i>Hearts of Darkness: White Women Write Race </i>(New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 2004), 17; hereafter abbreviated <i>HD</i>. Nonetheless, contemporary black critics continue to balk at Cunard's and <i>Negro</i>'s primitivism, as Marcus also notes (<i>HD</i>, 120). For instance, Mae G. Henderson, who introduces Marcus's essay on Cunard, "Bonding and Bondage: Nancy Cunard and the Making of the Negro Anthology," asks "whether or not Cunard's 'transgressions' are subversive or complicit with the dominant culture. Does she replicate or reproduce the colonization her actions and commitment are surely meant to reproduce? What, finally, are the implications of Marcus' own critical act of recuperation?" Mae G. Henderson, ed. and intro., <i>Borders, Boundaries, and Frames: Cultural Criticism and Cultural Studies </i>(New York: Routledge, 1995), 8. See also Petrine Archer-Straw's reading of Cunard and <i>Negro </i>in note 6 below. In response to Henderson, Marcus cautions that "unless and until black critics and readers find the exiled white radical 'race woman' sympathetic, . . . she will not find her place in history" (<i>HD</i>, 121).  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. Petrine Archer-Straw foregrounds Cunard's avant-gardist cosmopolitanism that led her to romanticize race: "Like many negrophiles influenced by L&#x00E9;vy-Bruhl's thinking, [Cunard] believed that culture was determined by race and environment and that blacks belonged to a primitive chaotic order rooted in nature that needed to be maintained for their cultural authenticity. It was their <i>joie de vivre </i>and connectedness with nature that could be used to revitalize white civilization" . This attention to Cunard's primitivism extends to Archer-Straw's reading of <i>Negro </i>as a whole: <i>Negro, </i>she writes, is a "selection gained from [Cunard's] travels and networking, rather than a reflection of a pan-African network. Despite Cunard's tireless appeals for fresh and definitive articles, the material collated was more personal and anecdotal than global. <i>Negro</i>'s eventual unevenness was an indicator of Cunard's ambition and frustration. Politicized material appears to have been lacking, and where gaps existed Cunard tried to fill them." Petrine Archer-Straw, <i>Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s </i>(New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000), 168. I disagree. The pan-African, political and anthropological material was groundbreaking for its time, and I suggest that we read the gaps as a symptom of transnationalism rather than as a flaw.

<p><a name="FOOT7" href="#REF7">7</a>. My understanding of transnational reading practices has been tremendously aided by Brent Hayes Edwards's work on what he calls the black internationalism of the African diaspora. Edwards defines the term diaspora as one "that marks the ways that internationalism is pursued by translation. This is not to say that internationalism is doomed to failure, but instead to note that it necessarily involves a process of linking or connecting across gaps" (<i>PD</i>, 11). Edwards holds that this connection across gaps serves as a "frame of cultural identity" determined through difference as much as through identification (<i>PD</i>, 12).  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT8" href="#REF8">8</a>. The key problem with cosmopolitanism is that it partakes in European universalism, what Simon Gikandi calls its "fatal linkage between race, nation, and cosmopolitanism in the genesis of modernity." Simon Gikandi, "Race and Cosmopolitanism," <i>American Literary History </i>14, no.3 : 597. Timothy Brennan argues against historical revisions of cosmopolitanism by critics such as Bruce Robbins to include the cosmopolitan experiences of working-class migrants: "cosmopolitanism offers a coming into 'modernity' as the global entrance into a common hybrid self-consciousness by formerly subjugated peoples, without in the least disturbing the self-portraiture of the West. For if we wished to capture the essence of cosmopolitanism in a single formula, it would be this. It is a discourse of the universal that is inherently local&#x2014;a locality that's always surreptiously imperial." Timothy Brennan, "Cosmopolitanism and Internationalism," <i>New Left Review </i>7 (January&#x2013;February 2001): 81.

Reviewing <i>Negro</i>, Edward Thompson in the <i>Observer </i>(London) April 15, 1934, wrote that "This is the most difficult book I ever had to review. . . . Its editor is without inhibitions, and has therefore been able to accept from every quarter and to put out her stuff as it came to her, straightforwardly. The result is not an anthology, but an encyclopedia, a book for two entirely different publics [the ultra-modern aesthetic public and the "square-toed sombre public"], each of which, I think, will look askance at the other." Herbert Read in the<i> Spectator</i> (London, February 23, 1934) began his review by indicating that it was "no light matter to review; and its very varied contents are beyond the scope of a single reviewer" . However, he <i>could </i>boil down its purpose to being that of "a manifesto and a protest" (ibid.). </p>

Surely I was being taught as much about El Dorado and the North Pole? Later came extraordinary dreams about black Africa&#x2014;'The Dark Continent'&#x2014;with Africans dancing and drumming around me, and I one of them, though still white, knowing, mysteriously enough, how to dance in their own manner.

Glick writes that the black dandy conflates aesthetics with the cultural politics of black nationalism and consolidates anxieties about African-Americans as modern subjects.

Glick, "Harlem's Queer Dandy: African-American Blackness and the Artifice of Blackness,"<i> Modern Fiction Studies </i>49, no.3 : 414&#x2013;42.
