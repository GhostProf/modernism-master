Never had a song sounded like this song. Never had a path led into the

like this one. The head knew nothing more of the legs. There was no

1. Mediating the New Order
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
<I>Hitlerjunge Quex</I> (Hitler Youth Quex) is a legend for modern times,
a film
with a fatal attraction.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
It sanctifies an adolescent's
heroic deed,
reshaping a young boy's dead body into an icon. It demonstrates a cinema
of clear
lines and straightforward answers, a medium charged with a mission: it
aims to
show the way. The film illustrates a political process and intimates a
master
narrative wherein human subjects become state objects and living beings
give way
to abstract patterns. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> both heralds a new
order and
preres its subsequent self-destruction.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
The first feature film substantially supported by the new government and
produced
under the protectorate of the Youth Leader of the German Reich, Baldur von
Schirach, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> offers a stirring example of how the
National
Socialists employed a modern medium for state purposes, mobilizing a vast
technology to craft gripping narratives and promote popular legends.
Goebbels
well recognized the film's potential value as a political instrument when
he
became minister of popular enlightenment and propaganda in March
1933.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Nonetheless, a comprehensive policy did not
immediately make
itself evident in the first declarations of the self-avowed "passionate
lover of
filmic art."
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Being in power did not mean controlling
culture; swift
legislation could not ensure overnight legitimation; any campaign of
coordination
<I>(Gleichschaltung)</I> would demand different strategies on different
fronts.

<p>
The National Socialists had become the masters of public life. Whether
they would
also become the masters of popular imagination remained to be
seen.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Minister entered the scene with a mixture of swagger and
circumspection,
proclaiming a desire to combat a spiritual crisis and "reform German film
from
the ground up" (<I>von der Wurzel) aus</I> so that it might convalesce and
grow
into a world power.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In his early programmatic declarations,
Goebbels blends natural and martial metaphors, speaking of films as a body
and a
territorial surface, declaring himself the physician whose surgury will
purge an
afflicted organism of harmful alien elements. He scorns wishy-washy
entertainments without national character, clear contours, and a sense of
the
historical moment. A new cinema for a new Germany must rediscover the
innate laws
of the medium and realize its mission as a mover of masses. "It takes
imagination," he proclaimed, "to grant life to the innermost purpose and
innermost constitution of a new world."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Repeatedly, Goebbels stresses how film should exercise a discernible
effect
<I>(Wirkung)</I>, how it must act on hearts and minds. Its calling should
be that
of a popular art <I>(Volkskunst)</I>, an art that simultaneously serves
state
purposes and fulfills personal needs. The new film must free itself from
art-for-art's-sake dalliance, intellectual liberalism, and wanton
commercialism.
However makeshift and ambiguous his first proclamations might have seemed
(they
apparently made for some confusion), Goebbels attracted attention
by taking
dramatic leave of a previous era's attractions, pointing the way to a
popular,
contemporary, and distinctly national cinema.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Film, he
proclaimed,
should emanate from political life and find its way to the deepest
recesses of
German soul and soil. Such a reform will take time as it will 

<B></B>

 demand energy and
sensitivity. It makes no sense to enforce an authoritarian dogmatism, to
"proselytize from morning till night."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Political ideas must
assume
aesthetic force. That does not mean, however, simply reenacting parades
and
spectacles, photographing marching storm troopers and fetishizing
flags and
emblems. "Arousing the masses, that's something we know a thing or two
about,"
Goebbels boasted, in so doing setting aside a special place for film apart
from
mass rallies and overt agitation. Mere loyalty to the party would not
guarantee
aesthetic success. Authentic film art must transcend the everyday and
"intensify
life."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> would do precisely that, intensifying life to the
point
of devivification. It focuses on a human subject and transforms him into a
political property. The film remakes and ultimately overcomes a boy's mind
and
body, rendering the material spiritual, transmuting being into form. This
process
involves the literal occupation of a destiny, its orchestrated
functionalization
by the mass media. Its subject was based on the life of Herbert Norkus, a
Hitler
Youth in the Berlin working-class district Beuselkietz, who had died at
the hands
of communist assailants while distributing leaflets during the election of
January 1932. Quickly enlisted as a Nazi martyr, Norkus became the subject
of
impassioned editorials and inspirational public addresses. Memorial
services for
the boy occasioned elaborate marches and demonstrations throughout
Germany. His
death received annual consecration on 24 January, a date of ritual
observance
during the Third Reich for all fallen Hitler Youths.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
These recognitions accompanied a wide range of popular renderings: novels,
plays,
poems, and songs.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Karl Aloys Schenzinger immortalized Norkus
in
<I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex</I>, a novel written between May and September
1932 and
prepublished in installments in the Nazi party organ, the
<I>V&ouml;lkischer
Beobachter</I>, prior to the book's release in December. The volume would
become
obligatory reading for Germany's youth, undergoing innumerable editions
and
registering sales of more than half a million copies by
1945.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Soon
after Schenzinger's novel appeared, Ufa, the most important studio of the
German
film industries, announced plans for a film version directed by Hans
Steinhoff
and produced by Karl Ritter, a project actively supported by the National
Socialist leadership.

<p>
The premiere took place in the Munich Ufa-Phoebus-Palast on 11 September
1933, a
festive event attended by party dignitaries (including Hitler,
G&ouml;ring, and
Hess) and accompanied by a gala performance of Anton Bruckner's Fourth
Symphony
by the eighty members of the Reich Symphony Orchestra.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The
film
received the rating "artistically especially worthwhile," prompting words
of
praise from Goebbels, who wrote the prominent Ufa executive, Ernst Hugo
Correll:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> represents the first large-scale attempt to
depict
the ideas and world of National Socialism with the art of cinema, then one
must
say that this attempt, given the possibilities of modern technology, is a
full-fledged success.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Germany's greatest film company, proclaimed the
<I>Licht-Bild-B&uuml;hne</I> on
12 September, has mobilized "its extraordinary technical, material, and
artistic
means" to create "a lasting document of human and social circumstances, of
the
spiritual and 



 emotional impulses which brought
about the turn in Germany's
history."
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The film likewise met with a degree of commercial
success, even if it did not match that of the more popular contemporaneous
Ufa
prodcutions directed by Gustav Ucicky, <I>Morgenrot </I>(Dawn) and
<I>Fl&uuml;chtlinge </I>(Fugitives). Having cost a modest RM 320,000 (an
amount
slightly above average for the time), it ran for fifteen days in the
massive
Ufa-Palast-am-Zoo, and by the end of January 1934 had attracted over a
million
viewers.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Like the two other feature films screened in 1933 which portrayed party
martyrs,
<I>SA-Mann Brand</I> and <I>Hans Westmar</I>, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>
unfolds as
a family drama against the political and economic crisis of the late
Weimar
years.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Heini V&ouml;lker, a printer's apprentice, joins a
communist
youth group at the prompting of his father, an unemployed worker and war
veteran,
a choleric drinker who torments his mournful wife. During a weekend outing
Heini
quickly grows disenchanted with his unruly comrades and flees their
alcoholic and
sexual revelry. Retreating into the woods, he spies a group of Hitler
Youths and
looks upon their nighttime ceremony with fascination, an interest
undiminished
even after the Nazis discover him and send him away. He returns to Berlin
effusing about their order and discipline, singing their anthem to his
mother,
and causing his father to scold and beat him. Despite this outburst
and the
promptings of the communist leader, Stoppel, Heini seeks out the young
Nazis
Fritz and Ulla. He refuses to participate in a communist raid on the new
Hitler
Youth dormitory, but cannot fully convince the Nazis of his good faith
until he
warns them that Stoppel and his group plan to bomb the new hostel. Mother
V&ouml;lker, confronted by an enraged Stoppel after the communist plot
backfires,
fears for her son, but does not know how to protect him. In desperation,
she
turns on the gas to put an end to both herself and the sleeping boy.

<p>
After awakening in a hospital, Heini finds himself surrounded by a
group of
Hitler Youths who express their gratitude and present him with a uniform
and a
mirror. As a result of his mother's death and his father's submission to
the
special plea of Hitler Youth Brigade Leader Cass, Heini moves into a Nazi
dormitory. Active and energetic (so much so that his alacrity gains
him the
nickname "Quex," i.e. quicksilver), Heini works all night to print
leaflets for
the upcoming election and insists on distributing them in his old
neighborhood,
Beuselkitz. Members of Stoppel's group, headed by the vicious Wilde, learn
of
Heini's presence and chase him through the streets, cornering him in a
fairground
where Wilde bludgeons him with the knife once coveted by Heini. When his
Nazi
cohorts reach him, it is too late. With his last breath Heini gestures
upward and
utters the words, "Our flag flutters before us, it leads . . . " as the
image
segues into a close-up of a party banner over which marching res
parade in
geometric conrations.

II. "Make Way, You Old Men!"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Herbert Norkus reappeared as Heini V&ouml;lker, a boy who overcomes his
own past
and the internationalism inherent in the name of his father: Heini
"V&ouml;lker"
becomes a 

<B></B>

 boy of the German "Volk," a hero who
responds to a
"v&ouml;lkisch"
calling and a historical mission.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
He resembles spirited
comrades in
arms who, possessed by patriotic fervor, fell in droves during the first
months
of World War I, a shared martyrdom made explicit in a contemporary press
booklet:
"Hunted down by the commune and caught, he [Heini] dies the sacrificial
death of
German youth, just as an earlier generation died before him at Langemarck,
death
for the sake of the new fatherland."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The film narrative
depicts how
Heini becomes a Hitler Youth, how human material ("V&ouml;lker") becomes
expediency incarnate ("Quex," i.e. mercury), a vehicle of transport and
tempo, a
political medium.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Quex's last words strike up a triumphant
song and
give way to a rousing march, a symphonic conclusion and an invitation to a
dance
of death.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Nazi cinema initially took form as a site of transformation: art and
technology
were implemented to engineer emotion, to create a new man--and to recreate
woman
in the service of the new order and the new man. The different being
envisioned
here was an amalgam of vitalism and irrationality, a creature longing for
spiritual rebirth, for ecstatic life undaunted by cerebration. In some
respects,
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> reaches back to expressionist scenarios, the
<I>Wandlungsdramen </I>(transformation dramas) of Ernst Toller, Georg
Kaiser, and
Ernst Barlach, plays in which angry sons rebel against tradition,
confronting and
even murdering their fathers, forsaking the bourgeois family in a search
for more
fulfilling communal ties. In both instances we find essentialized
emotions, the
pathos of what Gottfried Benn calls a "constructive mind."
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
"Facts,
things, feelings, and persons do not exist for it [the drama or film] in
their
own right, but only as parts in a working relationship to other parts.
Even as
content gives way to form, the concept of 'being' yields to the concept of
'functioning.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Similarly, the influential right-wing author
Ernst
J&uuml;nger valorized objectified human bodies. His new man relinquishes
existence as an individual, steeling blood and brains into the reified
technical
potential of the "type" <I>(Typus)</I>.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
puts a hero into motion by inhabiting his person, dissolving his family,
and
arresting his life. Heini becomes a part of a larger whole and thereby
whole in
his existence as a part.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
He functions as a role model for his
comrades in the film and for the many young Germans who watched this film.

<p>
Cinema assumed a key place within state institutions of discipline,
ring as a
mode of education, military training, and recreation. Film, claimed Nazi
Minister
of Education Bernhard Rust, speaking in 1934,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
is particularly important for our youngest citizens--the school children.
Film
must not only help them grasp contemporary political problems, it must
also
provide children knowledge about Germany's great past, and profound
understanding regarding the future development of the Third Reich. The
National
Socialist State definitely and deliberately makes film the transmitter of
its
ideology.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
National Socialism sought to organize the will of youth, to enlist it in a
historical mission. In challenging established authority, the party meant
to
usurp the place held by ineffective leaders of a moribund generation, in
effect
to proclaim, as 

<B></B>

 Gregor Strasser did in 1933,
"Make way, you old men!"
<I>(Macht
Platz, Ihr Alten!)</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
The Nazi party institutionalized
Oedipal
revolt, directing the young against "the parental home, church, school and
other
outdated forms and role models. In its youth organizations it assumed the
central
role in the rebellion of sons against their fathers."
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
Foregoing the Oedipal triangulation characteristic of the classical
narrative,
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> begins as a family drama; by its end both parents
have
disappeared, the dead mother only briefly mourned,
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
the father
having surrendered his son to the brigade leader.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The party
overcomes the family and bridges classes. Fritz and Ulla live in a
decidedly
bourgeois household, but their parents are nowhere to be seen and their
middle-class background in no way conflicts with their newfound political
identity. The party redefines family and social conrations, turning
itself
into the dominant focus of allegiance. (Elsewhere, the Nazi government may
have
paid lip service to the role of the family. Nonetheless, it
"simultaneously
deprived parents of the qualities on which a child's respect might have
been
founded" [<I>MFM</I>, 252-3]). The film's project, in short, was to
fabricate a
new political subject by redirecting identification.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
It
provided a
cinematic bildungsroman which aimed to rebuild the youth of a
nation.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
A movement occupied an individual in the hope of
overcoming
masses, providing images of self-alienation so compelling that an entire
generation could, as Walter Benjamin writes, "experience its own
destruction as
an aesthetic pleasure of the first order."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
Crucial to Heini's evolution is the acquisition of an ersatz ego, a sense
of self
derived not from parents but a party. Quex's new vocation also demands
that he
forsake sensual pleasure and sexual desire. Grundler, his roommate in the
Nazi
hostel, sings a popular tune about bawdy sailors, puffs on a cigarette,
and makes
suggestive comments about Ulla.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
"You're one fine comrade"
<I>(Du
bist ja ein feiner Kamerad!)</I> retorts Heini, setting himself apart from
such
intemperance, aligning himself with the otherwise unsullied ranks
of Hitler
Youth. Grundler idly plays a song from an escapist film which was composed
by a
Jewish artist; Heini sings of a flag and a party. One will betray his
comrades;
the other will die for a cause. Aesthetic preferences, the film intimates,
mark
one's person and define one's very being.

<p>
The communists constitute, as Gregory Bateson has noted, a structured and
systematic counterpart to the Nazis. Communist dissolution and lack of
discipline
stand in direct opposition to Nazi containment and resolve.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
While
Stoppel and his cohorts drink, gamble, and carry on, the Hitler Youth
stand
solemnly before a camp fire and honor the summer solstice. Heini ignores
the
sexual innuendoes of Gerda and--unlike Grundler--rejects her overtures.
Grundler
submits to physical temptation, shirking his duty and betraying the cause.
Heini,
at his most self-indulgent, enjoys a comradely kiss from Ulla and sips a
mug of
beer with Cass. Coming into his own, though, means steeling the body and
hardening the will, repulsing physical attachments and all-too-human
desires.

<p>
Heini is first drawn to the party when he witnesses a nocturnal spectacle.
He
experiences an immediate and intense fascination as he is swept up and
ultimately 

<B></B>

engulfed by this movement. Similarly, youngsters who partook of this film
found
themselves overcome by its audio-visual enticements. Bernhard K., ten
years old
when he first saw <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> in 1933, could vividly recall
the film
many decades later:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Communist youths were shown. All of them dressed like ruffians. Unsavoury
res. Then they set up camp and even girls were with them. Everything
was
really disgusting. The Hitler Youth on the other hand: all dressed the
same,
clean, nice, with leaders who had everything under control. I still
remember
today that after the film we all agreed: the Nazis made an altogether
great
impression, there was discipline, one wanted to join in. The communists,
on the
other hand, no, our parents would never have let us be part of a
bunch like
that.
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Just as Heini is overcome by the sights and sounds of a new order, so too
did
this filmic dramatization seek to overwhelm its young viewers, and to
shape them
into captive audiences.

III. The Fairground and the Forest
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The opening sequence of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> fixes on a street,
a space
governed by crime, chaos, and mass contagion, offering images well
known to
audiences of 1933. The shots portray an askew world where a youth's
attempt to
steal an apple and a shopkeeper's angry reaction ignite a political
spectacle:
debates among bystanders and expressions of outrage, the quick opportunism
of
communist rabble rousers, whose agitation causes a riot necessitating
police
intervention. The iconography here consciously evokes memories of
"Zille-films"
by Gerhard Lamprecht such as <I>Die Verrufenen</I> (Slums of Berlin, 1925)
and
<I>Die Unehelichen</I> (Children of No Importance, 1926), as well as
proletarian
dramas derived from Soviet models such as <I>Mutter Krausens Fahrt ins
Gl&uuml;ck</I> (Mother Krause's Trip to Happiness, 1929) and <I>Kuhle
Wampe</I>
.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
In fact, Steinhoff's direction seems quite insistent
about
its reliance on Weimar's cinematic legacy, borrowing as well from
<I>Berlin-Alexanderplatz</I> , <I>M</I> , and <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I> (The Threepenny Opera, 1931).

<p>
Hans Steinhoff's career as a filmmaker stretched back to the early 1920s;
he had
worked in numerous generic veins, gaining respect (if not inordinate
admiration)
for his technical precision, skillful handling of players, and careful
crafting
of dramatic materials.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
(Cameraman Konstantin Irmin-Tschet
likewise
had worked on famous Ufa films directed by, among others, Fritz Lang,
Robert
Siodmak, and Wilhelm Thiele.) How, though, are we to understand the film's
blatant recourse to Weimar cinema? The National Socialists took a dim view
of
most <I>Systemzeit</I> (a Nazi epithet for the Weimar Republic) features
and
Goebbels firmly wanted to replace them with a new German film. Further,
both
Steinhoff and the production head Karl Ritter had unequivocal allegiance
to the
party.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Previous accounts of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> stress how it brings
together
conservative images and left-wing impulses, blending Hugenberg and
M&uuml;zenberg. The Ufa film 

<B></B>

 evokes the atmospheric
urban venues of Weimar
and
revisits working-class spaces: narrow apartments, smoky pubs, joyless
streets.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Carryovers also inhere at the level of theme,
motif, and
dramaturgy, be it an obsession with knives and a pursuit scene straight
out of
<I>M</I>, or the fairground barker and his ballad which recall <I>The
Threepenny
Opera</I>. Heini's family seems lifted out of films made by Phil
Jutzi, who
directed both <I>Mother Krause's Trip to Happiness</I> and
<I>Berlin-Alexanderplatz</I>. His father is a latter-day Franz Biberkopf,
an
individual castrated during the postwar era for whom class consciousness
offers
little succor;
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
his mother, like Mutter Krause, turns on the
gas to
take leave of her misery.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
These familiar elements allowed
audiences
convenient points of reference. Critics typically speak of an artistic
continuity
with Weimar film, coming to conclusions like that of Francis Courtade and
Pierre
Cadars: "If one puts all ideology aside, which surely is not easy, then
one must
say, that from a technical and aesthetic perspective <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I> is
an outstanding film."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
What people have tended to obscure in
their
catalogues of intertexts, however, is how most of these borrowings are
negatively
charged. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> retreads memories in order to clear the
way. It
overcomes a past of inflation and despair and points to a hopeful future;
in
reckoning with Weimar film, it presages a new cinema. It recycles
proletarian
films by Jutzi, Brecht, and Dudow, remaking Herta Thiele's confident and
sensual
Anni of <I>Kuhle Wampe </I>into the de-eroticized Nazi <I>M&auml;del
</I>(girl)
Ulla. It also quotes from Lang and Pabst, at the same time pursuing a
strategy
meant to supersede and transcend Weimar cinema in the name of a different
film
art.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Central to the structure of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> are two spaces
and the
fascination they contain for Heini, namely the fairground and the forest.
Going
back as far as <I>Der Cabinet des Dr. Caligari</I> (The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari,
1920) the fairground recurs throughout Weimar film as a privileged site of
agitation, spectacle, and desire, a realm of motion and excitement, a
protocinematic cult of distraction.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The carnival
ground--described
in Schenzinger's novel as "a truly fantastic world"--initially lures Heini
with
its attractions and games of chance (<I>DHQ</I>, 14). It is there that he
glimpses a knife with eight blades, an object of fixation which will
repeatedly
appear during the film. It is there that the communist Stoppel seeks to
win over
the boy and the vampish Gerda makes her rounds, whirling on the carousel
with
abandon and later seducing Grundler to betray his comrade. It is there
that Heini
will die under the knife he coveted. The fairground becomes a realm
of sex,
peril, and dissolution, a space that teems with uncontained potential and
unbridled appetite, a province of impermanence, randomness, and
intoxication. The
film presents the fairground as a locus of illicit sights and sounds,
leaving no
doubt that the communists are quite at home in this world of chance and
uncertainty.

<p>
The communists do not, however, control the fairground. They lack a
distinctive
will to form and fail to devise a spectacle of their own. Whether
partaking of
carnival attractions or mimicking Nazi gestures, the group attests to an
absence
of substance and identity.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
When Stoppel and his cohorts go
to the
forest they recreate the fairground, transforming natural space into a
site of
card playing, sexual dalliance, 

<B></B>

 and rampant
consumption. Heini runs into
the
woods to abandon these amorphous masses and cluttered images, seeking
fresh air
and open spaces. Gradually, the commune's accordion gives way to brass
fanfares
and a song with a strident tempo and spirited lyrics. Curious, Heini
follows the
sound, stopping behind a bush to look down on neat rows of boys and girls
standing around a fire, listening to their leader hallow rising flames to
celebrate a better Germany. The natural setting and human ornament merge;
this is
a spectacle that rivets Heini's gaze, a ceremony with an impressive
composition,
a striking choreography, a binding power.
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
If the communists
contaminate nature, the Nazis contain it. The forest no longer appears as
an
extended fairground, but rather takes on the countenance of a training
camp.
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
It is not nature, but an extremely domesticated nature
that
overwhelms Heini, a mass shaped as a larger body, compact columns of human
potential, energy and purpose fueled by a mysterious force.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
When he
later seeks to recount his experience, the boy can only describe physical
activity and recite the words of a song about a flag and a movement.
Sights and
sounds, not argument and rhetoric, have won him over.

IV. Reach Out and Touch Someone
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art acquired a copy of <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
from the <I>Reichsfilmarchiv. </I>During World War II, the prominent
ethnographer
Gregory Bateson undertook a close thematic reading of the film as part of
an
endeavor to comprehend National Socialism through its cinematic
self-depictions.
Bateson recognized that the lies of propaganda also contain distinct
truths, that
"this film, insofar as it is an integrated work of art . . . must tell us
about
the psychology of its makers, and tell us perhaps more than they intended
to
tell."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Approaching the film with "the sort of analysis that
the
anthropologist applies to the mythology of a primitive or modern people,"
Bateson
pointed out how the film, in its systematic structuring of oppositions
between
the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, illustrates the
projective
workings of Nazi subjectivity. Communists appear as unbearable
self-images, what
Nazis think they "would be like without their discipline or--
psychologically
speaking--what they are like under the veneer of that discipline"
(<I>SCD</I>,
311). Sensitive to how the film carries out its ideological agenda
within a
narrative setting, Bateson comes a fair way towards understanding its
rhetorical
power. Aside from a few brief comments about lighting contrasts and visual
motifs, however, his thematic analysis has little to say about matters of
form.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Most subsequent discussions of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> speak of the film
as
overt propaganda, as a dramatization of "the struggle for the German soul
between
National Socialism and communism."
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Similar to the
contemporaneous
<I>SA-Mann Brand </I>and <I>Hans Westmar</I>, claims David Welch,
<I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I> embodies that "lie direct," that is, "film is exploited entirely
for
propaganda purposes; there are no subtle pretensions of mixing art with
politics"
(<I>NPP</I>, 48). Given what he considers a lack of refinement, Welch
finds no
need to address questions of representation or to distinguish between
propaganda
and ideology.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Nor is visual acumen necessary. The message 

<B></B>

 is
clear,
we need only listen: "From start to finish, the National Socialist
ideology is
loudly and unashamedly proclaimed" (<I>NPP</I>, 48).
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
Welch's procedure resembles Anglo-American wartime responses to Nazi
propaganda.
Commentators spoke of it as primitive and unrefined, readily transparent
to
anyone graced with common sense. As Thomas Doherty demonstrates, American
wartime
audiences "were educated to the ideological power of mass communications,
flattered over their superior powers of apprehension, and assured of their
democratic immunity to the falsehoods of Axis enticements." Nazi
ideologues were
seen as clumsy and obvious, incapable of duping a more sophisticated
American
public. Hollywood productions of the 1940s represented German ploys as
risible
and flat-footed, assuming "a condescending and professorial tone when
addressing
its poor relations in mass communications. Look, the screen seemed to say,
see
how amateurish are the tricks, how easily exposed are the secrets,
of these
lesser media, so prone to manipulation and cheap effects." <I>Divide and
Conquer</I>, a Warner Brothers short of 1943, asserted that a con man of
the Nazi
media was no match for a movie- conscious American: "You are up to his
tricks.
You can see through his technique."
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The brash strategy was
meant to
build public confidence; it surely had its justification in the context of
a
world war. In our present setting, however, such smugness becomes an
interpretive
disability that blinds the viewer to textual seductions.

<p>
Commentators repeatedly dwell on the confrontation between Brigade Leader
Cass
and Herr V&ouml;lker as the film's "key scene," a showdown where former
class
enemies "t for the young hero's mind."
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
These analyses
concentrate on the dialogue, dealing with the film as if it were a written
script. We read nothing about composition, blocking, gesture, about the
visual
surface of the text in question.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
This "key scene" likewise
seems to
stand in isolation. We gain no precise sense of its place in a larger
narrative
structure. Here Nazi propaganda would seem to <I>speak</I>--I stress the
word--forthrightly and apodictically. As Klaus Theweleit reminds us,
though, we
dare not solely dwell on what fascist language "says"; we need to
comprehend how
it functions (<I>MFM</I>, 261). If anything, the scene in question and the
narrative as a whole rely more strongly on tactile rather than verbal
persuasion.
The film appeals to a feeling rather than a thinking spectator. If the
party
member prevails, it is not because of what he says, but how he speaks. And
what
convinces is the personal touch.

<p>
A closer look at the famous confrontation bears this out, a scene of nine
shots
lasting a little more than three minutes.
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
The convalescing
Heini,
dressed in pyjamas and bearing a cane, sits on a part bench (shot no.
322). We
cut to Herr V&ouml;lker and Cass walking towards him (shot no. 323),
moving to a
closer view of them as they approach the boy (shot no. 324). The two enter
the
frame to greet Heini in a complex shot that will take almost seventy-five
seconds
(shot no. 325). Initially, Heini stands to the right of his father and
Cass;
V&ouml;lker then moves aside as Heini shakes hands with the brigade
leader. The
youth's question, "Where am I to go?" <I>(Wo soll ich'n hin?)</I> in
essence
reiterates the compositional dilemma. The father, who has turned his back,
spins
around, insisting the boy belongs to him. <I>"That</I> is the question"
<I>(Das
eben ist die Frage!)</I> retorts Cass as the camera changes its position
to 

<B></B>

exclude the father from the frame, thereby anticipating the scene's final
outcome. Cass and Heini sit down on a bench. "Where does the boy belong
today?"
<I>(Wo geh&ouml;rt der Junge heute hin?)</I> the brigade leader asks,
going on to
effuse about the wanderlust of youth. "Boys are something wonderful!"
(Jungens
sind etwas wunder bares). he rejoices, with perceptible homoerotic
enthusiasm.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The camera lingers for a long while on a
close-up of
Cass's animated face, panning to capture Heini's transfixed response.
"Where does
the boy belong?" repeats Cass. We pan right from Heini to his father, who
peers
at his now offscreen son; the camera then dollies back to give us a
two-shot of
Herr V&ouml;lker and his son. Heini, though, is elsewhere, contemplating a
faraway world, coming to himself only when his father elbows him and bids
him to
speak.

<p>
After his initial question, Heini remains silent for the duration of the
scene,
positioned between the two adults as they square off in a physical
confrontation.
While Herr V&ouml;lker hunches down, his hands tightly gripping a hat
between his
legs, he articulates the body language of someone diminished and depleted,
paralyzed by the past (shot nos. 327-8). The camera cuts to a two-shot of
father
and progeny (shot no. 329), displaying wounded sons of Germany in need of
help.
The scene's climactic take (shot no. 330) will last forty-five seconds.
Reversing
angles, the camera cuts to a vantage point behind the bench, realigning
itself so
that the viewer experiences the showdown from Heini's perspective. Both
men stand
up during the face-off: Cass confident, hands in pocket, his voice
controlled;
V&ouml;lker huffy, limbs taut, expression grim. Cass belittles
V&ouml;lker's
communist allegiances, his comrades, the International. The brigade leader
asserts his superiority, commanding the frame, casting a shadow and
looking down
on V&ouml;lker, asking him where he was born, in what city, in what
country. His
face brightly contoured by the light, Cass repeats the ultimate answer as
an
irrevocable truth ("In Germany, that's right!"), his fingers moving back
and
forth between himself and his interlocutor: "In <I>our</I>
Germany!" <I>(In
Deutschland, jawohl! In unserem Deutschland!)</I> His hand reaches out and
repeatedly taps V&ouml;lker on the chest. "Think about that, why don't
you!"
<I>(Das &uuml;berlegen Sie sich mal!)</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
A hand reaches out and touches a listener. A compelling presence provides
a role
model for Heini, a better self-image for Herr V&ouml;lker, a point of
orientation
for the viewer. A subsequent scene, another prolonged take, bears out just
how
strong an impression Cass has made (shot no. 335). Speaking over beer with
Stoppel, V&ouml;lker repeats the brigade leader's catechism, but more
importantly, assumes Cass's compositional place and reenacts his
persuasive
performance. V&ouml;lker's gaze is now firm, his manner confident. He
confronts
an interlocutor with a challenge whose impact goes beyond words and logic,
whose
ultimate effect is that of a physical demonstration. He, like his son, has
been
won over and transformed, recast in the image of a new
Germany.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Stoppel also takes pause. Later we see him with a copy of the Social
Democratic
<I>Vorw&auml;rts</I>, suggesting at least a partial shift of political
allegiance. In the end, likewise, he warns Heini and sidetracks the boy's
pursuers.

<p>
We dare not underestimate the formal surfaces and visual strategies
of Nazi
films, even in the case of one of its most undeniably placative
productions.
Goebbels and 

<B></B>

 directors like Steinhoff understood
well the power of images,
how
they could stir imaginations and activate emotions. "The camera is the
star among
the film studio's equipment," cinematographer Konstantin Irmin-Tschet
would later
write, "it stands at that pinnacle of perfection which supports the art of
great
performers. . . . Being beautiful is not the thing, the point is being
clear!
Whoever sees clearly, sees most artistically!"
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Karl Aloys
Schenzinger, likewise, recognized how visual impressions could offer clear
points
of orientation. In the novel <I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex</I>, Heini thumbs
through
the pages of a Nazi magazine, the <I>Illustrierter Beobachter,</I> coming
across
a photograph of a proud young boy standing at attention, underneath which
we read
the caption, "Germany's future." Immediately Heini makes the portrait a
part of
his own person, embracing "the boy deeply in his heart" <I>(den Jungen
tief in
sein Herz geschlossen; DHQ,</I> 160). Later, Heini reads an account of the
Tyrolean war of liberation (the backdrop used by Luis Trenker in his film
<I>Der
Rebell</I> [The Rebel], 1932), afterwards lying in bed and dreaming about
what he
has read: "There had been a moving story about a boy who had dragged
munitions
and water to the Tyrolean troops, until a French bullet laid him to rest.
Like
that boy in the story, he too saw the flag with the red eagle rising out
of the
darkness, he heard the noise of the rifles and the cries of the victors"
<I>(DHQ,</I> 207).
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
What does <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> disclose about early Nazi film
aesthetics?
Goebbels sought to transform the film apparatus into a tool of the
state, a
medium of myth, legend, and fantasy which would relieve reality of its
dialectical complexity. The primary task when the National Socialists came
into
power was that of reshaping public imagination in accordance with its own
persuasions, of presenting an appealing and compelling worldview. At issue
here
was nothing less than the control over perceptual
possibility.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Among all of the media, film would from the start assume a privileged,
indeed
seminal role in the Third Reich. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> bore out
essential
aspirations of Nazi fantasy production. First of all, film was enlisted to
simplify the world rather than to complicate it--in essence, to
dedialecticize
reality. In the early 1930s, this meant winning over cynical and weary
minds to a
cause by presenting a world of clear fronts and unimpeachable certainties.
"Reason as such," claimed a contemporary editorial entitled "National
Socialist
Film?" "has been divested of its cold power and has become what it should
be: the
technique of thinking with the heart." Second, the medium's proper calling
was
not only to simplify, but also to heighten experience, to provide an
emotional
frisson. "We demand of art," continued the editorial,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that it genuinely move us and not just stupefy us with sensations; we
demand of
art that it probe the foundations of humanity and plumb its ultimate
depths; it
must show us the breathing of the soul and not, as has been the case for
so long,
just the pounding of the brain. We want to partake of the rhythmics of the
soul,
not just the monotonous uniform march of international
intellectuals.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
Goebbels's rhetoric and that of productions such as <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
privileged the discourse of the immediate and the authentic. The new
German
cinema strived for a visceral appeal. In the process film was to become an
industrialized means of behavior modification.

<p>
National Socialism, despite its ideological pretensions of a coherent
worldview,
was to a great degree the function of stirring spectacles and pyrotechnic
demonstrations. Film provided the special effects with which the Third
Reich
created itself in its own image. In decisive ways, film and National
Socialism
would become of a piece. The flow of images and the movement of a party
afforded
nonstop excitement and ever-shifting perspectives. Each employed elaborate
choreographies and dramatic displays of emotion in the name of making
fictional
worlds become real. Both reached out to beholders, aiming to control their
undivided attention.

<p>
In <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>, we witness the fabrication of a new man. This
new
man is no material being. The film tells the story of how a young boy
becomes a
political property. Inscribing an appeal to spectacle within a medium of
spectacle, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> sought to bind a nation's youth to a
party's
cause. While claiming youth, the National Socialists also sought to
reclaim
cinema, realizing the power of both entities in their campaign to
transform the
German nation. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> puts a party design into motion;
its
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne reshapes a scene and reforms a country, leaving
behind
Weimar tableaux of loitering and crime, progressing toward final images of
personal sacrifice and collective abandon. We open on a site of hunger and
confusion; we end with the ecstatic vision of a future order. With a
trajectory
that leads from a mob of agitated onlookers to a conration of spirited
participants, the film forsakes the agitprop of proletarian realism in the
name
of a classless society's transcendent power. It disdains the illicit
voyeurism
and sensual abandon of a decadent regime and privileges the fixed gaze and
erect
body of a new order, asking spectators to take the discursive leap from
Caligari
to Hitler, to transform the fairground into the parade
ground.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
This
involves a shift of specular allegiance as well: distractions of flowing
skirts
and whirling carousels are exchanged for the intoxication of billowing
banners
and parallel lines.

<p>
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> mediates the myth of a martyr in order to
mobilize
emotions. The dead Herbert Norkus becomes the raw material for the
fictional
Heini V&ouml;lker, who, brought back to life by a nameless amateur actor,
metamorphoses into <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>, whose dying body in turn
segues into
a waving flag that becomes a screen for the sights and sounds of a
party.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Human substance evaporates into disembodied function;
a
corpse evanesces into a medium for a movement. The climactic moments of
<I>Hitler
Youth Quex</I> impress upon viewers a consonance between a waving flag and
filmic
flux.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Both provide attractions that bind spectators and
subjects:
to a movement, to a medium. The final sequence involves a celebration of
death in
which human sacrifice is experienced as aesthetic revery. "The flag means
more
than death" (Die Fahne ist mehr als der Tod) are the film's closing words.
This
film, likewise, is more than just a film, as its last shot of storm
troopers
marching offscreen into the battles of the future intimates. <I>Hitler
Youth
Quex</I> is not only an early 

<B></B>

 Nazi feature, but
also a remarkable preview
of
coming attractions, a <I>Bewegungsfilm </I>that shows the way to war and a
nation's collective self-destruction.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
As Max Picard later
observed,
this new order would not lead to a new world. It "is a rupture rather than
the
real thing; this beginning is in fact the end: it is a world coming to its
real
end through its thousands of pseudostarts."
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
Surrendering
one's
person, participating in a great spectacle, and acting in a celluloid
fantasy
will become of a piece for Germany's marching minions.
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
<I>Hitler
Youth Quex</I> emanates from a cinematic apparatus that, in equal measure,
is to
be a dream machine and a death factory.

(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990), 119; hereafter abbreviated

</I>This source provides a meticulously researched account of Norkus's
life,
death, and transration. Throughout his book, Baird mimics National
Socialist
perspectives, simulating its virulant anti-Semitism, anticommunism, and
misogyny.
This discursive ploy is undoubtedly meant to be critical; at times,
though, it
gives way to an unwitting affective alignment. A description of the
character
Wilde, for instance, grossly embellishes what we see in Steinhoff's film:
"When
the devil took human form, he came as Wilde, and his followers are the
gangsters
and shadowy res who compose the neighborhood KPD. His physiognomy is
calculated to reflect an inner nature of decomposition; here, indeed,
was a
'subhuman,' the product of miscegenation, venereal disease, and
criminality.
Unshaven, squint eyed, and repulsive, he was the incarnation of
Bolshevism. The
gutter was his proper milieu" <I>(TDG, </I>123). The communist Gerda's
"raw
sexuality," we read, "is devoid of Nordic refinement"; a "painted street
girl,"
she provides "a walking catalogue of Berlin vice" <I>(TDG, </I>123).

In order to enhance the fictional impact of Quex, film officials
suppressed

for the
sake of a larger cause.

Compare the expressive deathbed tableau in Karl Aloys Schenzinger's
novel:
"Heini sits up in bed with his eyes wide open. His gaze flickers, fixes on
no
one, peers into emptiness before it slowly fades out again. The nurse lays
the
sick boy down. His mouth opens. His comrades hear something, but they
can't
recognize the words. Then terror overcomes them. Heini is singing. They
stand
there paralyzed. They don't know the words, but they recognize the melody
that
oozes, chimes, and rattles in his throat. They sing it almost every day,
every
evening, on every march, on every outing. They've sung it with Quex, just
recently. It's terrible to hear him singing like this.

<p>
"The nurses bid them silent leave. They sneak away, upset, disturbed,
desperate.
They feel it. No one talks about it. Everyone knows: this is the song of
death."
(The original reads: "Mit aufgerissenen Augen sitzt Heini aufrecht im Bet.
Der
Blick flattert, sieht keinen an, sieht ins Lehre und schlie&szlig;t sich
langsam
wieder. Die Schwester legt den Kranken zur&uuml;ck. Sein Mund spricht.
Deutlich
h&ouml;ren es die Kameraden, aber es ist nichts, was man verstehen
k&ouml;nnte.
Dann aber packt sie das graue Entsetzen. Heini singt. Sie stehen wie
versteinert
da. Sie verstehen nicht die Worte, aber die Melodie kennen sie, die aus
diesem
Munde hervorsickert, r&ouml;hrt und r&ouml;chelt. Sie singen sie fast

all.
Theweleit notes the general absence of fathers in the
<I>Freikorps</I>-literature: "Whether heroes or chief opponents, fathers
are
categorically denied a voice in these books. To a remarkable extent, they
are
simply dispensed with. . . . Patriarchy secures its dominance under
fascism in
the form of a 'filiarchy'--that much is clear. Nothing but sons as far as

(Wilhelm Reich, <I>The Mass Psychology of Fascism,</I> trans. Vincent R.
Carfagno
[New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1969], 46). Heini turns away
from his
father and Stoppel, finding in neither a desirable focus for his energies,
and
aligns himself with the party, an entity much larger than a single
individual. As
he says to Stoppel: "I believe in my F&uuml;hrer and my comrades, that's

Heinrich George, a former communist who became an important stage and

brown thus paralleled his real-life transformation. Curt Riess (in his

desperation and accommodation, an attempt to save his career and
reestablish
himself; see Curt Reiss, <I>Das gab's nur einmal: Die gro&szlig;e Zeit des
deutschen Films, </I>vol. 2 (Munich: Molden, 1977), 230-3. No matter what

Nazi
discourse: "After all, the Nazi did not even invent the song with which he
seduces. Nor even the gunpowder with which he makes his fireworks, nor

In the Nazi calendar, the summer solstice (21 June) served as an
occasion to
recruit new Hitler Youth members. See Klaus Vondung: "The summer solstice
celebrations lent themselves particularly well to ritual presentations,
where,
before a deeply symbolic fire and against a nocturnal nature backdrop, one
evoked
religious states of mind and feelings in the service of National Socialist
ideology." (The original reads: "Die Sonnwendfeiern waren besonders dazu
geeignet, rituelle Handlungen vorzunehmen und angesichts des
symboltr&auml;chtigen Feuers und vor der Kulisse der n&auml;chtlichen
Natur
religi&ouml;se Stimmungen und Gef&uuml;hle im Dienst der
nationalsozialistischen
Ideologie hervorzurufen," in Klaus Vondung, <I>Magie und Manipulation.
Ideologischer Kult und politische Religion des Nationalsozialismus</I>
[G&ouml;ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1971], 81.) Compare the opening
sequence of Edward Dmytryk's <I>Hitler's Children</I>  with its
stylized
studio replication of a Nazi summer-solstice ceremony, replete with a
stirring
speaker, an ornamental mass, and chiaroscuro lighting.

See the compelling recollections of Peter Br&uuml;ckner, <I>Das
Abseits als
sicherer Ort: Kindheit und Jugend zwischen 1933 und 1945</I> (Berlin:
Wagenbach,
1982). Br&uuml;ckner describes his youth during the Third Reich and his
ongoing
attempts to find pockets of fresh air, spaces not controlled by the party
or the
state. He notes how Hitler Youth outings virtually occupied forests and
countrysides, "to be entered either as an exercise ground or as a site of
loud
games, and one could hardly withdraw from either." (The original reads:
"Das
Drau&szlig;en, von dem der lyrische Song ausging, war betretbar entweder
als
Exerzierplatz oder als Ort f&uuml;r laute Spiele, und beidem konnte man
sich kaum
entziehen," in Br&uuml;ckner, <I>Das Abseits,</I> 31.) For a scene
redolent of
Br&uuml;ckner's description, see Schenzinger, <I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex,</I>
181-3.
As the government increasingly closed its net to ensure all youth joined
party
organizations, there was some level of resistance, especially after 1938.

The young actor who played Heini was reportedly the lover of Baldur von
Schirach. See the intriguing memoirs of a Hitler Youth member, Hans
Siemsen's
<I>Hitler Youth,</I> trans. Trever and Phyllis Blewitt (London: Drummond,
1940):
"There was a lot of talk . . . about Schirach's relations with a certain
boy with
whom he was seen about everywhere over a long period. Even at official
functions
this boy either stood next to him or was a member of his escort. . . . No
one,"
he concedes, "thought any the worse of Baldur von Schirach for loving this
boy.
We all loved him and quite understood how it was that the Reich Youth
Leader had
singled him out." For this reason, the verb "to quex" <I>(quexen)
</I>became
"part of the vocabulary of Hitler Youth. It is easy to imagine what it
means"
. Schirach was hardly the exception, maintains the author. "Among the
sixty
to seventy Hitler Youth Leaders with whom I came into close contact
practically
half were considered by us boys to be homosexuals." Siemsen describes a
popular
contemporary booklet, <I>Deutsches Jungvolk,</I> with "admirable
photographs of
boys, marching, camping, eating and bathing; and two full-size portraits
of two
particularly good-looking boys. It can be seen at once (I don't mean this
ironically) that the leaders who compiled the booklet are very susceptible
to
good looks in their boys" (Siemsen, <I>Hitler Youth,</I> 146).

<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> would often be reprised during the Nazi Youth
Film
Hours from 1940 through 1942--and received with great enthusiasm (see Gerd
Albrecht's comments in <I>Der Spielfilm im Dritten Reich,</I> ed. Manfred
Dammeyer, 52). Alfred Weidenmann's <I>Junge Adler</I> (Young Eagles, 1944)
was
consciously intended as a continuation of <I>Quex, </I>a film for young
audiences
which built on the earlier success. A father gives his son over to the
Hitler
Youth after his own attempts at raising the child have failed. We see how
a youth
collective regulates itself, how boys educate other boys (much like the
Hollywood
film <I>Boys' Town,</I> 1938). The production in fact issued from
government
concern about how youths were becoming restive and out of control during
the war
years, reacting negatively to the hard work (e.g. ten-hour workdays,
graveyard
shifts), discipline, and sacrifice demanded of them, while being forbidden
to go
out at night, visit bars, smoke in public, or attend cinemas alone. The
working
title for <I>Young Eagles</I> was "Schritt ins Leben" (Path to life): here
again,
the film was meant to show the way. For an analysis of the film, see Rolf
Seubert, <I>"Junge Adler:</I> Retrospektive auf einem
nationalsozialistischen
Jugendfilm," <I>Medium </I>18 (July-September 1988): 31-37.

"Gentlemen, in a hundred years' time they will be showing a fine color

in that
film? Hold out now, so that a hundred years hence the audience will not
hoot and
whistle when you appear on the screen" (quoted in Leiser, <I>Nazi
Cinema,</I>
132). The original reads: "Meine Herren, in hundert Jahren wird man einen
sch&ouml;nen Farbfilm &uuml;ber die schrecklichen Tagen, die wir
durchleben.
M&ouml;chten Sie nicht in diesem Filme eine Rolle spielen? Halten
Sie jetzt
durch, damit die Zuschauer in hundert Jahren nicht johlen und pfeifen wenn
Sie
