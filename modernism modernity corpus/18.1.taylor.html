<p>Although it is less widely read than her classic novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> , we might consider Djuna Barnes's 1958 play <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>—with its baroque language, its fraught relation to autobiography, and its bizarre and challenging anachronism—the most 'Barnesian' of the author's texts. Of all the works in Barnes's oeuvre, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> has suffered the most from the charges of difficulty and unreadability—and in this case unperformability—that have marked her critical reception. For certain feminist critics, such apparent "difficulties" have been recast in part as editorial issues: these critics read the play's obscurities as problems caused by cuts at the hands of Edwin Muir and, above all, T. S. Eliot. In what was, to date, the only published study of the play's revision history, Lynda Curry concludes by proposing that if three hundred-odd lines (removed from the final edition) could be reinserted, "the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> would emerge as the beautifully coherent and poignant tragedy that its author had envisioned."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> This fantasy is problematic not just because it relies on theoretically questionable and practically unsustainable notions of authorial intention and textual integrity, but also, in its conflation of coherence, affect, and aesthetic pleasure, misses the point of why <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> is such a remarkable play. As Barnes's last major work, and her fullest engagement with the complexities of a traumatic sexual experience we can reasonably imagine as broadly autobiographical, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s obscurities and opacities are powerfully connected to its theme. In what follows I want to consider how the changes made during the play's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> revisions need not be viewed with regret, but in fact produce a shift in emphasis that captures the performative nature of remembering trauma. I also want to consider the limitations of a feminist discourse surrounding the sexual and textual corpus, according to which Eliot and Muir, like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s abusive father, are cast as powerful violators of a vulnerable and pure body.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> is a three-act tragedy in blank verse detailing the sinister reunion of the Hobbs family. While the play is not without moments of dark humour—occasioned in part for this reader by linguistic excesses as richly camp as "Curbing the waspish bodkins of her eyes / Spurring the fornication of the mint"—it is Barnes's most singularly bleak work.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> The family reunite in Burley Hall, the ruined ancestral home of the mother, Augusta, and a former college of chantry priests, situated in the fictional English town of Beewick.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> The family have been brought together by one son, Jeremy (disguised as "Jack Blow, coachman,") who acts part court-jester, part advocate, as he restages the childhood abuses suffered in an unorthodox, polygynous, and probably incestuous family home not unlike the one depicted in Barnes's 1928 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span> and in her own biographies.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> It emerges that Miranda, now middle-aged, has been abused by her father, Titus, and raped by "a travelling cockney thrice [her] age" at Titus's arrangement and with Augusta's acquiescence (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 186). Augusta has been repeatedly wounded by her late husband's dalliances, and is angry not only with Titus, but also with his deceased mother, Victoria, and, less reasonably, with Miranda too. The other Hobbs sons, Elisha and Dudley, are unsympathetic characters who function in the play as a critique of capitalist excess and philistinism: they have also been abused by Titus but harbor equal resentments towards both Augusta and Miranda. The collective witnessing of the past takes place in front of Jonathan, Augusta's uncle, a genteel and apparently kindly old man who still lives in Burley Hall.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s journey from first incarnation to published play was a long and difficult one. Barnes was returning to a form with which, alongside poetry, journalism, and short stories, she had begun her career in the teens. With the exception of two unpublished three-act plays, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ann Portuguise</span> (undated) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Biography of Julie von Bartmann</span> , her earlier experiments with drama had been one-act works written, as others have noted, in styles reminiscent of Synge and Wilde. We cannot be absolutely sure when Barnes began writing the play we now recognize as the published <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span>, but while she was certainly working on the project for nearly a decade, it may well have been closer to two. In 1948 Barnes made an unsuccessful application for a Guggenheim Fellowship in which she states her aim to "bring to the drama that dignity of concept and poetic utterance which in the present practice of realistic comedy and melodrama has been forgotten."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> But Louis F. Kannenstine cites a letter to Charles Henri Ford of 4 August 1936, in which Barnes states that she had begun to write a verse drama, as evidence that she was beginning work on the play at the time of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>'s publication.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> It does seem that if Barnes started writing a play in the late 1930s, any real progress would be slow until around 1950 when she started to overcome (or at least better manage) some of her significant personal problems, which had included a breakdown (for which she was hospitalized), alcoholism, and severe financial hardship.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The earliest complete drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> in Barnes's archives at the University of Maryland date from July 1954, and were followed by four further significant stages of redrafting before the play was accepted by the board at Faber &amp; Faber in November, 1956.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> was published in 1958, and Barnes made further (relatively minor) changes for the reprint in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Selected Works</span> .<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Eliot assumed editorship in 1954, and Muir became involved in 1955. The archive also includes an undated typescript for each of the first two acts, both catalogued under the heading "Early Draft." These two undated acts, however, do not appear to match up: while Act 1 represents, I think, the oldest extant version of this act, Act 2 is a later, post-July, 1954 draft.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Many—though not all—of the revisions occurring between 1954 and 1956 relate to simply reducing the length of the play, especially the overlong Act 2. I shall return to Eliot's role in this, and feminist interpretations of the editors' excisions relating to details of sexual abuse, but it is perhaps important to note that material unrelated (or at least less directly related) to the abuse narrative was also cut, some of it on the basis of editorial advice, some of it apparently at Barnes's own initiative. Jack Blow's speeches, particularly in Act 1, are much lengthier in earlier drafts of the play, where he resembles more closely the garrulous Matthew O'Connor, whose speeches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> were also cut after suggestions from Eliot.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Another change involves a character referred to variously as Elivira/Countess Castaigne/Prudence/the old <span style="font-style:italic;">Belle Laide</span> of Lange d'Oc. In the published play, Elvira, the "old <span style="font-style:italic;">Belle Laide</span> of d'Oc" is discussed briefly by Jack in Act 1 (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110). Elvira is a Burley sister who "got herself to France" and whom, Jack tells us, Miranda met in Paris aged 91 (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110). Like Miranda, she is a rather theatrical woman, inhabiting "a slashing zone of taffeta" with her head "gabled in a cone of voile" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110).<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The lines relating to Elvira, and those in particular to her braided hair, which are absent from the published text, exist in increasingly vestigial form throughout the drafts.</p>
<p>A more crucial change—and one that involves rewriting rather than mere excision of lines—relates to the characters of the "merchant" brothers, Dudley and Elisha. The brothers' language and behaviour powerfully captures the affective complexities of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s family scenario. When, for instance, Elisha steps up to Augusta and, "<span style="font-style:italic;">tapping her with his closed hand</span>," asks "Who killed Cock Robin?", the play's atmosphere of malice, blame, and reckoning is conveyed in an economic and impersonal manner (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 141, italics in original). In the undated "Early Draft" there are three, not two, brothers—Barnaby, Oliver, and Kit—but by July 1954 they are two: Barnaby and Elisha.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The general trend in revision is that the brothers' dialogue is reduced in quantity and transparency: in these early versions of the play their dialogue is less stylized, less opaque, and more prosaic—indeed they speak in prose rather than verse throughout "Early Draft"—and they have fewer outstanding lines. In Act 1 of July 1954's "Finished Copy" there are eight pages containing dialogue between the brothers that was subsequently cut. In prose in parts, their speech is less aphoristic than it would later become, containing more factual information about their lives.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> By September 1955's "Copy 1" the dialogue between the brothers (now Elisha and Dudley) is predominantly written in the dense verse we find in the final version. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This increased emphasis on a less realist, more theatrical and affectively ambivalent mode of dialogue, better characterized by the brother's chilling performances of nursery rhymes than bald statements about the their lives and intentions, is part of a larger trend that I want to consider further. The changes with which this essay is largely concerned relate to an increased emphasis on performance, theatricality, and—the change that dominates Curry's discussion—the excision of the "hayhook" scene in which certain explicit facts about the rape are given. I want to consider the productive relationship between these changes in relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s treatment of traumatic memory. I am interested in considering how the play's revisions might be read as generative rather than damaging, and how excision of several of the play's balder statements about the Hobbs family's history of sexual violence is matched by an increased emphasis on characteristics I relate to the trauma response: performativity and performance, stylized ritual, and affective complexity. While I do not wish to subscribe to a "Whig interpretation" of textual history, reading each draft as an improvement on the last, I want to question the benefits of the kind of reparative re-editing suggested by Curry, while challenging the fiction of an ideal and authorially pure textual body that was violated by Eliot's editorship.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the tasks for Barnes's readers, and for the reader of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s narrative of sexual trauma in particular, is to make sense of the author's complex understanding of the relationship between the personal and the fictional. Notions such as veiling and hiding are unhelpful when it comes to understanding the relationship between textual opacity and personal history because of the ways in which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> makes the reader aware that testimony is an activity in which the past is not simply revealed, overtly or covertly, but created anew.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> invites us to problematize the idea of a transparent and unmediated narrative of sexual trauma with static and clearly defined subject positions of victim and perpetrator. Similarly, Barnes seems to reject the value of anything amounting to a confession. As such, the play forces us to question the usefulness of feminist approaches that privilege these very things as the hallmarks of a "successful" testimony to sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Barnes remained anxious about the politics of personal disclosure throughout her writing life. This anxiety increased when the disclosures related to sexual injury, as is evidenced by the claim that she terminated her early career as a journalist by refusing to report on the victims of rape.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Barnes's concerns about such revelations, and the focus on the victim's sexuality they might provoke, are suggested by Miranda's refusal to confess her own (adult) sexual history or to confirm that she has led a life that is debased or in some way fitting for a sexual abuse survivor. A critique of the salacious interest in confession is expressed through Augusta's aggressive questioning of her daughter: '<span style="font-style:italic;">Is it true that you had forty lovers?</span>' (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 204, italics in original). Barnes suggests that confession might lead to the demand for further confession, and is anxious about the paths that this demand might take. In this context, the exchange between Miranda and Augusta half way through the final act is significant:</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The repetition of 'nothing' echoes <span style="font-style:italic;">King Lear</span>, suggesting the impossibility of understanding between parent and child, and thus implies that Miranda's speech might be pointless as a tool for change. Miranda's refusal to answer may be more empowering than "speaking out": her silence is "hard-won" and therefore valuable in the context of the demand for revelation about her sexuality. In this sense, Barnes seems to preempt Foucauldian anxieties about bringing sexuality into discourse, while tapping into a rich feminist pre-history about the force of self-elected female silence. Equally, announcing one's status as a victim is treated with some scepticism in the play. When Augusta protests "I was a victim" she is mocked by Elisha's "Oh not <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> again," the implication being that she has clung too readily to this identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 159; 160, italics in original). For Augusta, the appropriation of victimhood appears to be inseparable from the fetishization of psychic wounds and a simultaneous inability to accept her own agency within the family. Yet while Barnes remains sceptical about the celebration of wounded identities, she does not settle on silence as the best option either: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> demonstrates a serious engagement with precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> one might testify to traumatic experience. I want to suggest that, through a self-conscious representation of the performative nature of testimony and witnessing, Barnes gets beyond categories of victimhood and <span style="font-style:italic;">ressentiment</span>.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The sexual abuse of Miranda—who is generally read as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s Djuna Barnes re—has been singled out as the play's most significant example of trauma and victimization. While this focus is entirely justified by the text, some critics have oversimplified Barnes's treatment of the dynamics of sexual trauma. Louise DeSalvo's reading relies heavily on Judith Herman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Father-Daughter Incest</span>, a foundational text in the feminist study of incest and child sex abuse. DeSalvo argues that the reader must "live through" Miranda's "terror, fear, and self-loathing moment by moment" and "learn her language, the language of the incest-victim, which simultaneously masks and reveals."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> While pathologizing Miranda, DeSalvo reifies her victim status and takes up Herman's argument that incest is an initiation into prostitution, suggesting that child abuse is the beginning of an endless cycle of victimization. Herman argues that child abuse leads to a "life of repeated victimization" and serves as "an early and indelible lesson in woman's degraded condition."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Herman's account is based on the belief (key to many feminist analyses of incest) that it is not only the incest survivor but woman in general whose identity is fixed through patriarchy's various violences and oppressions.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Although Herman does account for some variety in the experience of incestuous abuse, for her the result is predetermined: "The actual sexual encounter may be brutal or tender, painful or pleasurable; but it is always, inevitably, destructive to the child."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> As Janice Haaken notes, the belief that objective abuse inevitably results in psychic shattering "is not so far from the idea that virginal women are 'ruined' by  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> early, culturally unauthorized sexual experiences as well as by sexual abuse."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Although traumatized by her childhood abuse Miranda is in no sense "ruined"—she is depicted as a forceful and articulate woman who has built a successful life among the theatrical elite of Europe. The possible reference to Ibsen's reworked "fallen woman" play in the doll's house scene suggests that Miranda's sexual abuse, although traumatic, might not have automatically led to disempowerment and disfranchisement.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span>  depicts a middle-class married woman who, when her shameful history is revealed, not only avoids ruin but actively chooses a life of empowered independence outside the family. Nora's crimes ultimately serve as anti-patriarchal pedagogy rather than victimhood within patriarchy. Barnes's characterization of Miranda challenges the inevitable link between unsanctioned sexual activity (whether consensual or not) and a permanent state of sexualized victimhood.</p>
<p>And just as certain critics have written Miranda's agency out of the text, narratives of the play's editorial and redrafting process have tended to replicate this gendered dichotomy between victim and perpetrator(s), whereby a vulnerable Barnes in confessional mode is hampered by the prudish censoriousness and censorship of Eliot and Muir. Eliot's editorship in particular is described by some critics as akin to the sexual interference of Barnes's fictional fathers. In her otherwise sensitive analysis of Barnes's treatment of incest, Broe makes a direct comparison between Eliot and the re of the abusive father: "the cuts form a painful 'textual masquerade' of the daughter's painful violation … by the authority of his pen, Eliot reproduces the incestuous desires of the violating father by his intrusion in the daughter's script."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Broe's comparison is problematic precisely because it risks replicating the "Daddy Warbucks essentialism" that she so accurately identifies as a characteristic of incest discourse, the "fixed male hegemony over the powerless woman who lacks agency, maturity, or voice."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> My study of the play's manuscripts and attendant correspondence suggests that this version of events is in fact an inaccurate representation of the relationship between Barnes and her editors.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Furthermore, in their emphasis on the violation of penetrating the textual body, critics such as Broe and Curry bring a particular kind of sex-negative politics to editorial discourse, reiterating an understanding of sexuality and sexual abuse most clearly articulated in DeSalvo's feminist reading of the play—a sexual politics which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> in fact opens up for critique.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> And, crucially, the desire for narrative clarity implied by the anxious emphasis on textual gaps ultimately obscures a nuanced understanding of the play's engagement with the complexities of traumatic testimony.</p>
<p>Curry emphasizes Barnes's powerlessness in the face of editorial control, blaming Eliot in particular for compromising Barnes's vision and thus ensuring the critical and popular failure of the play. As Daniela Caselli observes, "Curry's argument that Eliot's and Muir's excision greatly damage [sic] the play is not sustained by Barnes's own notes."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Caselli cites as evidence Barnes's annotation of "I didn't accept much. D.B." next to Muir's "But as for my excisions I don't know yet whether Miss Barnes will accept them or reject them" in a 1955 letter to Eliot.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Further indication of Barnes's agency in the editorial process may be found in a 1956 letter to Eliot, where she reports a discussion  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with Muir: "He had remarked that the first act needed cutting, in 'some of the best lines' because it was 'too busy in a static sort of way'—an observation that I thoroughly enjoyed."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Barnes claims to have left "some parts of the first act on the cutters [sic] floor, where I saw that perhaps he was right—in other cases I either removed lines, or rearranged, corrected, or rewrote."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Rather than allowing us to reconstruct Barnes as a bullied or manipulated victim, this archival material might also produce a more dynamic image of editorial relations, in which a gendered dichotomy of power is not central to our reading.</p>
<p>It is not, however, Muir's editorship that forms the center of Curry's focus; rather her attention rests on a specific letter from Eliot (dated 10 August 1956) which she claims instigated a final revision from which the play "never recovered."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> While Muir's suggestions for major omissions (not mentioned by Curry) relate to the first act, Eliot finds the second act the most in need of cutting.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Emphasising Eliot's "severe demands" on Barnes to "accept his editing and make further cuts of her own" Curry cites his call for "much more drastic cutting, twelve to fifteen pages. Don't cut anything at the end, but I feel sure that there are pages in the middle that can be disposed of."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Curry's essay focuses on excisions made in this middle section of Act 2, and she places particular emphasis on the importance of an omitted scene where, in his attempt to make Miranda "mutton at sixteen— / Initiated vestal to his 'cause'!" Titus</p>

<p class="continued">This scene occurs in the undated "Early Draft" and the September 1955 copies, but not in what I deduce to be Barnes's earliest extant versions of this act, which date from July 1954 ("First Copy" and "Finished Copy"). The scene takes the form of a reminiscence by Dudley, and occurs in the middle of Act 2 before the brothers attack the women. In "Early Draft" the speech is difficult to decipher: as many typed lines are crossed out in ink as are left untouched, and Barnes's hand-written annotations and rewrites cover the page. On might argue, therefore, that Barnes was unsure about the wording of the scene even at this stage. The lines are included in Dudley's speech in the September 1955 Copy 1 with two additional typed lines at the end which are just legible although Barnes has crossed them out several times in ink: "You know, I've seen heifers dangling from an halter / Just like that, while he charged the rape-blade in."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In Muir's Copy 2 from September 1955 there is no direction to drop this scene but in Eliot's copy from the same time there is indeed a light pencil "x" through the entire block of lines from Dudley that include the hay-hook reference.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In the fourth September 1955 copy the scene still exists but the last four lines are heavily altered and annotated in Barnes's red and green ink.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> And in the February 1956 typescript, the scene is again heavily annotated.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> It seems that, regardless of Eliot's suggestions, Barnes was not entirely satisfied with how these lines were reading, although at this stage she was trying to improve them. Among a file of <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> drafts marked "April-June  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> 1956 Miscellaneous pages" there is a page containing the "hay-hook lines" headed "(new page—July 31—56)" in Barnes's hand.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> There is a line across the whole page and Barnes has written "decided out" next to the text. Barnes's excision need not be seen as forced but rather as a measured decision to delete a scene about which she was unsure from an act that was excessively long.</p>
<p>But rather than simply locating Barnes's agency in this excision, which admittedly still leaves us in the territory of intentionality, I want to challenge Curry's reading on other grounds. By clinging to the fantasy of an entirely pure, uncorrupted, and unequivocally elucidating original text, one risks privileging an image of the play as an unmediated confessional narrative. In this case, textual "integrity" amounts to an impossible confidence in the closeness of the text to the author's traumatized psyche; a closeness that recovering and reinserting excised material can restore. A similar imperative has also governed certain analyses of Barnes's earlier family narrative, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span> . Ann B. Dalton, for instance, imagines a lost textual history that might help us access <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span>'s hidden incest narrative and align murky fiction with solid biographical fact.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>As Brenda R. Silver has written, some feminist textual critics in the 1970s and 80s saw textual editing as "a means to break through the surface of established texts and established views and bring to light 'submerged' texts."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Interestingly, Louise DeSalvo's work on Virginia Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, in which she recovers the "submerged" text of the author's very first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, is discussed by Silver (and other editorial theorists) as a key example of such work. For DeSalvo, the problem with <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia/The Voyage Out</span> is not editorial intervention but <span style="font-style:italic;">self</span>-censorship: Woolf chose not to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> because there were revealing autobiographical parallels in the work, and so produced a less personal, less intense, less emotional, "disguised" version in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, viewed by DeSalvo as a form of "masquerade"<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> In her introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, DeSalvo describes her original speculation that pages of the early versions of the text might be scattered through the extant manuscripts, "although now dismantled, <span style="font-style:italic;">mutilated</span>, cut in pieces, cancelled or overwritten."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> This notion of the text as a mutilated body—mutilated, in this case, by the author herself in response to (patriarchal) literary conventions—is not reiterated directly in DeSalvo's work on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, but res as a kind of spectre in feminist readings of the play's revisions, in which Curry's narrative that Eliot interrupted or damaged Barnes's narrative of sexual abuse is taken for granted and yoked together with an emphasis on the violence of sexuality. While Broe makes this link explicit with her comments about Eliot's "violating" pen, we might also note that DeSalvo takes the title of her essay about patriarchal abuses (which, for her, paradigmatically include sexual abuses) from the key excision identified by Curry: "'To Make Her Mutton at Sixteen': Rape, Incest, and Child Abuse in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>." Such connections serve to underscore Jane Gallop's argument that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Notions of integrity and closure in a text are like that of virginity in a body. They assume that if one does not respect the boundaries between inside and outside, one is "breaking and entering," violating a property. As long as fantasies of integrity and closure are upheld, a desire to penetrate becomes a desire to rape.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The impulse to treat <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> as a damaged text that must be restored, is, I suggest, not very far removed from the impulse to see Miranda/Barnes as a sexually ruined woman who might be healed if only she could tell her story in an uninterrupted, unmediated fashion. Regardless of whose decision it was to cut the lines, we might, I suggest, dwell on the consequences that this shift in emphasis produces as opposed to restoring the scene and "repairing" the text.</p>
<p>Besides raising questions about the politics of authorial intention and textual integrity, the assumption that the published <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span>'s narrative is incomplete invites us to consider our understanding of what testimony should look like. Curry's particular focus on the hay-hook scene and attendant lines relates to her wish to clarify the narrative of sexual abuse she sees (quite accurately) as central to the play. But behind such an intention seems to lie the assumption that the most unambiguous incest/sex abuse narrative is the most "true." By reinserting the lines she claims that Barnes was "forced" to cut, Curry offers a clarified plot—which equates to a clearer incest narrative—imparting "complete and coherent sense" to apparent discontinuities and ambiguities.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Curry argues that because certain speeches have been cut from the final draft "the problems that the family has inherited seem less specifically overpowering" and so the children "appear obsessed with trivia, struggling with shadows, arguing with a dead man."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Such an interpretation of textual history would seem, again, to be connected to a particular moment in feminist debates about sexuality, specifically sexual abuse. The intense controversy surrounding memories of child abuse "recovered" during psychoanalysis or other therapeutic scenarios has meant that the terms of the debate became fixed in the dichotomies of belief and non-belief, truth and falsity. Haaken suggests how "layers of gendered and ambiguous meanings" in women's recollections of childhood abuse are incompatible with an approach that "overlooks the truths contained in even false accounts about the past. Framing the controversy in terms of true and false memory is sorely inadequate because it misses the range of meanings and partial truths that lie between these polarized, absolute categories."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> During the feminist focus on incest in the 1980s, Haaken argues, "the ambivalences and complexities of eroticized power relations were anxiously re-pressed within much of the storytelling that took place in the sexual abuse survivor moment."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The urge to get to the factual heart of Barnes's incest story is, troublingly, also a desire to smooth out its powerful ambivalences and explain and contextualize the explosive affect of her dramatic work.</p>
<p>Perhaps underlying such desires for clarity is an understandable wariness about invoking misogynistic stereotypes of female hysteria. Linda Alcoff and Laura Gray note that in sexual abuse survivor discourse "too much" emotion can be seen as "a conscious manipulation, evidence of lack of control, or as simply inappropriately personal."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Yet Alcoff and Gray also argue for the importance of questioning "a position that assumes that it always a good thing for survivors to 'control' our emotions in regard to our experiences of sexual violence," and ask the important question of who benefits the most from such control.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> Similarly, Haaken finds "something amiss" in the contempt for "emotional excess and irrationality" in clinical discourse and notes that "at the base of hysteria is a battle for recognition, one that women must wage in a way that does not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> alienate their audiences."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Curry indeed links the play's apparent confusions, discontinuities and excesses—caused, she claims, by Eliot—to the alienation of its audience. Although the play's early reception was not generally favourable, and it has not been widely performed, some of the more positive responses suggest that an audience's ambiguity about the plot is no barrier to their affective engagement.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Ivar Harrie, in the audience of the play's performance in translation in Stockholm, remarks that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Yes, the audience really caught on—gradually. After the first act the people were very awed—and a little afraid of showing how lost they felt. The second act has a bewildering—but unescapably [sic] exciting effect. The third act … broke down all resistance: there was no alternative but to surrender to the dramatic poem.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Harrie's reaction is cited frequently perhaps because it conveys a common experience in those who value Barnes's play: his comments suggest that one is not affected by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> because one fully comprehends the narrative, but rather that feeling might, in some unexpected way, stem from bewilderment.</p>
<p>Just as the play's history of composition and redrafting should not be understood exclusively through the category of loss or absence, neither should obscurity or opacity be confused or equated with absence in the case of Barnes's representation of trauma. In his essay on Barnes, Walter Kalaidjian focus on excisions and gaps as signs and symptoms of trauma in themselves:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> [sic], the latent trauma of incest leaves its trace variously in the linguistic distortions and gaps that punctuate the verbal character in the play; in the extensive editorial cuttings that both Barnes and Eliot made to the explicit presentations of the event; in the pattern of censorship marking the history of its stage productions; and in its general silencing in the reception of Barnes's oeuvre.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Unlike the feminist readings I discuss above, Kalaidjian's reading appreciates that meaning does not depend exclusively on narrative clarity, but in stressing the role of "gaps," "cuttings," "censorship," and "silencing" he represents trauma as functioning only as a negative shade in the play. Despite its status as a category that undermines representational certainty, trauma functions not merely as absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, but makes itself felt in multiform ways in both the corporeal and textual body. The excision of the hay-hook scene does not only or exclusively create a gap (indeed, it functions as such only if one knows of its original existence), but rather it changes the nature of the play's treatment of trauma. It is in some of the apparently "obscure" passages of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> that the affective force of traumatic memory is impressed on the reader, through the complexity and ambivalence of Barnes's writing, rather than words not written. We might consider, for example, this affecting speech by Miranda:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>The salt spilled, the bread broke. Unmuzzled bone<br>Drew down the hood of flesh, entombing laughter:<br>Tongues came forth, and forth the hissing milk<br>Its lashing noose, and snared the gaping mouth. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>A door slammed on Eden, and the Second Gate,<br>And I walked down your leg.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 194–195)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The sinister domesticity of images such as the spilled salt and broken bread impart a certain <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span> feeling to the reader, and the image of bodily horror that follows suggests the Kleinian notion of the trauma of birth. Yet these bodily images also suggest a threatening sexuality—the "unmuzzled bone" and "hood of flesh" imply a grotesque representation of both the act of conception and the act of birth. The experiences of Miranda before and during her birth, and later as a sexually abused child apparently robbed of "innocence" ("a door slammed on Eden") are mapped onto each other to illustrate the confused, overdetermined, traumatic memory, where image precedes narrative clarity.</p>
<p>Barnes's scepticism about disclosure, her fears about victimization, and the sense one has from reading her work that the most clear or realistic narrative is not always the most expressive, have something in common with recent queer approaches to the questions of incest, sexual abuse, and trauma. Ann Cvetkovich has emphasized the value of obscurity and digression, arguing that the work of Ann Randall and Dorothy Allison, while showing a commitment to "truth telling," actually "demonstrates how imaginative work that may bear an oblique relation to the actual event of sexual abuse can ultimately be more healing than an explicit rendering of the event."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> While <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> names rape and abuse, its focus is on the complexities of telling and witnessing as much as on these acts themselves. And crucially, like the texts chosen by Cvetkovich, Barnes's play "point[s] to healing as a process that engages the body and consists in rituals of performance that defy simple notions of disclosure."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> The "queer healing practice" identified by Cvetkovich provides an alternative to certain feminist approaches to trauma, and emphasizes the performative structures I find central to Barnes's work.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> As I will now elaborate, the published play offers an alternative to disclosure and "narratives of innocent victims" in its representation of the performative nature of testimony, the role of witnessing, and the possible therapeutic value of repetition and ritualized violence.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>Curry finds it regrettable that, due to the excisions, "the audience has to get most of its information from Jack's crystal speech in the dollhouse scene of act 2."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> However, this shift in emphasis moves us from the realm of the revelatory—from the constative narrative of "what happened" found in the hayhook scene—to the realm of the suggestively performative. The re-enactment of the trauma within this play-within-a-play is a compelling feature of Barnes's text and one that benefits from such centrality. After Augusta has played with dolls representing her dead husband and his mistresses, she, and the rest of the cast, are forced to witness anew the events of the past, which are linguistically re-staged as the characters look into the doll's house. Horrific images of the "ting shadow of the Devil and the Daughter," and Miranda "Dragging rapeblood behind her, like the snail" are witnessed as performances within the house as opposed to being narrated as completed actions (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 185). In his "crystal speech" Jack gives a more factual account of events, where the narrative has been put into the past  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tense, and we are told that Augusta submitted to having the sixteen-year-old Miranda "Tipped" to the "travelling Cockney," Bridgid-Matilda's brother, who was procured by Titus (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 186). However, even in this more blunt narrative of the traumatic event, Jack notes the performative dimension of traumatic memory when he says (to Augusta): "The eye baby now you're pregnant with / You'll carry in your iris to the grave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 185). The notion of an "eye baby" suggests quite succinctly (and horrifyingly) how the traumatic image is brought into the world by its testimony and witnessing. The doll's house scene and Jack's lines within it allow Barnes to explore the notion that trauma is not merely exposed but rather created through its telling. And significantly, just as this scene gains prominence through revision, the theatrical emphasis becomes increasingly evident elsewhere in the play throughout the redrafting process.</p>
<p>Historically, critics have been largely sceptical about the role of the theatricality I find so important to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, emphasizing instead, and oppositionally, its poetic qualities.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> Yet the distinction between language and action, poetry and drama, is perhaps not a helpful one in the case of Barnes's play, where language itself takes on a theatrical or, as Caselli writes, a "spectacular" quality.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> The significance of the work's dramatic form is emphasized, however, in a 1991 essay by Meryl Altman. Stressing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s self-referentiality and the role of the gallery as a vantage point for spectators within the play, Altman suggests that this significance resides chiefly in the suitability of drama for Barnes's "final anatomy of the deceptions and manipulations women and men practice upon those closest to them."<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> While Altman is correct in acknowledging the importance of performance to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, her emphasis on deception promotes an arguably puritanical understanding of drama. Although the tropes of masking and concealed identities are used (by Elisha, Dudley, and Jack), I understand these devices rather differently. Barnes emphasizes the staginess of Jeremy's role as Jack, and the pig and ass masks worn by Elisha and Dudley do not so much disguise them as form part of a ritualized re-enactment of a traumatic event. Indeed, Altman's defence against the charges of Barnes's anti-theatricalism relies on an anti-theatrical concept of drama: Martin Puchner notes that "anti-theatrical prejudice" comes back to a limited number of obsessions: "the immorality of public display, of arousing the audience, and, most importantly, of those who professionally practice the art of deception."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> I want to suggest that Barnes's theatricality relates not to the manipulation of any of these apparently negative associations, but rather to her recognition of performance as an appropriate means of testifying to and witnessing hurt. In this respect, Barnes's choice of form is powerfully connected to her traumatic theme. An emphasis on deception is problematic partly because it reinscribes the play into the dynamics of hiddenness and exposure associated with the kind of confessional narratives that Barnes attempts to avoid, while relying on a notion of objective reality that the trauma structure brings into question. And like the trauma structure, where origins are created through performance, Barnes's emphasis on acting as reality forecloses the celebration of originality.</p>
<p>As I have suggested with the example of the doll's house scene, performing and restaging events allows for a focus on the process of remembering rather than the revealed, already remembered event. In her urgency to problematize the truth claims associated  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with "looking back" at sexual abuse, Haaken stresses the usefulness of privileging "the verb over the noun—<span style="font-style:italic;">remembering</span> as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic;">memory</span>."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Art historian Jill Bennett makes the distinction between narrative and traumatic memory, connecting the performative nature of remembering trauma with a non-narrative communication of affect. Bennett claims that traumatic memory offers a realm of secondary imagery in which affective experience is "not simply referenced but activated or staged in some way."<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> The idea of memory being "staged or activated" reflects the psychoanalytical understanding of the trauma narrative as testimony to an absence, "to an event that has not yet come into existence."<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Before this process, writes Dori Laub,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The trauma—as a known event and not simply as an overwhelming shock—has not been truly witnessed yet, not been taken cognizance of. The emergence of the narrative which is being listened to—and heard—is, therefore, the process and the place wherein the cognizance, the "knowing" of the event is given birth to. The listener, therefore, is a party to the creation of knowledge <span style="font-style:italic;">de novo</span>. The testimony to the trauma thus includes its hearer, who is, so to speak, the blank screen on which the event comes to be inscribed for the first time.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While indicating the performative dimension of testifying to a traumatic event, Laub stresses the importance of the witness; the listener. By structuring her work as a play with an implied audience and by including a significant play-within-a-play, Barnes emphasizes the role of reception or witnessing.</p>
<p>While several direct statements about the family background and abuse were ultimately excised, the revision process saw the inclusion of further details capturing the performative nature of traumatic testimony and witnessing.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In its published form, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s theatrical qualities are apparent from the opening stage direction, which points to its metafictional setting. With its gallery, balustrade, and arched doorway, the old hall's architecture forms a kind of stage set, complete with theatrical and circus accoutrements, which, as Jonathan Burley later reveals, belong to Miranda. Miranda is an actress and "wardrobe mistress" and her brother Jeremy is disguised as a clownish re who refers to himself as "Jack" and claims to have first met Miranda in Paris (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210). Both Jack and Miranda wear theatrical costume: in a line only added in the September 1955 revision, Jack says "In the shutting down of Paris, we took off / In whatsoever part we had been playing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 131). In the undated "Early Draft" the opening scene and stage direction contains fewer references to the theater.<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> There is "a lay-re in uncertain military, bandboxes, musical instruments and stands" and although there are references to "Carnival gear" there is no mention of stage costumes or Miranda's theatrical career. By July 1954 there is a greater theatrical emphasis in the opening stage direction and description of Miranda and Jack. The stage direction includes a reference to the "parts of stage costumes" strewn over the balcony rail, and for the first time Barnes mentions her carnivalesque, mythical stage-upon-a-stage: "the divided halves of what was once a merry-go-round griffon."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Miranda's dress is now described as "a costume suitable for the last act of a tragedy" and Jack enters the stage theatrically holding his hat above his head "as though expecting audience in the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> gallery."<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> By September 1955 Miranda's costume is described in even more explicitly as "obviously of the theater," the line that will remain in the play.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> While Barnes's principal "testifiers" are performers from the play's first incarnation—in "Early Draft" Act 1 Jack is already jester-like, "ducking and bowing"—this tendency is exaggerated through revision.</p>
<p>Equally, the role of the audience becomes more significant during the redrafting process. In a letter of September 1955, Barnes explains to Eliot her decision to include a group of travellers specifically to provide an audience (or group of witnesses) for Augusta.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> Barnes also adds meta-fictional references to an audience during her revision of the lines at the beginning of Act 1 when Jack wonders where their uncle Jonathan is, and worries that he alone will see and hear Miranda's testimony. There is no mention of the testimony as a "scene" with its absent "actor" and "audience" until September 1955, although by July 1954 Barnes has modified the speech to include the line "My hands will have to be your clamour, lady."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> In his copy of the September 1955 version, Muir recommends the cutting of these lines, but while Barnes acquiesced with a number of his suggestions—reducing Jack's speeches in the first act and excising references to Elvira—she kept this significant line about the importance of an audience.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>While the doll's house scene exists in all drafts of the play, it assumes greater prominence through excision of the hay hook scene and other references to abuse. The prop itself is mentioned earlier in later versions: in the "First" and "Finished" first acts of July 1954 Jack tells Burleigh (sic) that his luggage is "a kind of ark" to which Burleigh replies "Noah's?" but by September 1955 (Copy 1) Jack suggests to Burley:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>This luggage that you mention<br>Could it be, good sir, or could it not?<br>A beast-box, say, a doll's house, or an ark?</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Jack himself behaves in the manner of a malcontent in an early modern revenge play, enraptured by the theatrical nature of his own plotting: "Do I unplot my head by plucking hairs? / Or throw my lines away between my teeth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 93). These meta-fictional references increase through Barnes's revisions, and the references to "unplot my head" and "throw my lines away between my teeth" were not added to the first act until the "First Copy" of September 1955.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, theatricality in both a literal sense and as a broader concept is crucial when testifying to affective experience. When Jack discusses details about Miranda's life in Paris he also speaks of the theater: performance and biography, acting and self, are kept in close proximity. If Miranda has already turned the hall into a kind of stage (she has left her theatrical props, "bonnets, flags and boxes") when she first talks plainly about the house and her mother, Jack turns the testimony into a kind of double act, playing the role of clown or jester, rolling the hat up and down his arm (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 95). Jack's advice to Miranda about speaking is also a kind of stage direction:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Whip up your splendours and your consternations,<br>Stand to the trumpets and the terrors,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Give tongue for tongue,<br>For all the tapestries have thrown their spears!</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 112)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Rather than a vulnerable turning-inwards, then, it is suggested that testimony about the past might look more like a rather camp piece of theater, where stylish performance precedes values such as sincerity, honesty, and solemnity. The image of tapestries that have thrown their spears suggests a theatrical tableau of stylized and collective action, where agency is not located at the level of the individual, but rather as part of the work of art itself. Importantly, Miranda and Jack's double-act implies that testimony does not have to be a solitary experience but can be a collaborative public performance.</p>
<p>Equally, performance is crucial to Barnes's discussion of abuse partly because it allows for empathic identification between characters as they act out each other's roles. This kind of identification between victim and perpetrator provides a challenge to the kind of models of victimhood endorsed by critics like DeSalvo. Central to this strategy is Miranda's occupation as both an actress <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a "wardrobe mistress, tiring many parts": she both performs and enables others to perform (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210). Miranda and her mother have exchanged clothes and rings, and by reminding her mother of this intergeneration cross-dressing Miranda brings Augusta "<span style="font-style:italic;">back to pleasant thoughts</span>"—she wants to "pretend we're girls again; let's play" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210, italics in original). As James Scott notes, in the third act Barnes seems to rely on a double meaning of the word "play."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> In the course of the act, Augusta's enthusiasm about an imagined lost youth and "innocence" occurs while she acts out the role of her daughter. Both kinds of play seem to be intimately related and Augusta's imagined nostalgia for her own lost youth is also in part an imagined nostalgia for the time before her daughter was raped and abused. The idea of <span style="font-style:italic;">imagined</span> nostalgia is important, as the idea of acting removes the emphasis from any real originary event, thus emphasising the particularity of the affective scenario occurring in the present tense of the play. When Augusta swaps shoes with Miranda and says "Love puts forth her foot; let's to the opera," she hopes to play the part of Miranda <span style="font-style:italic;">as a performer</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 198). The identificatory process is reciprocal: Miranda imagines the idyll and the subsequent destruction of Augusta's childhood. The emphasis on "playing" has the function of allowing for the imagination of certain affective scenarios without the assumption of specific identities. Through a process of empathic identification the two women explore their feelings about their individual and collective trauma. This comfortable and productive overlapping of self and other means that Miranda and Augusta do not assume the polarized identities of victim and perpetrator.</p>
<p>A similar identification between victims and perpetrators occurs in the doll's house scene, in which context we might ask again how well certain feminist analyses of sexual abuse capture the complexities of Barnes's trauma narrative. I want to conclude this essay by considering further the affectively complex and politically challenging reenactments of sexual trauma by Miranda and Augusta. In particular I want to consider how, unlike the excised hayhook scene, the doll's house lines offer a potentially troubling scenario of phallic identification on the part of a female "victim." In this scene,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Augusta's play allows her to possess the phallus of her dead husband, and so engage in a ritualized repetition of his harmful sexual activity.</p>
<p>In much psychoanalytic discussion of trauma, repetition is treated as a symptom of disturbance that must, through the creation of a narrative, be prevented. This conventional understanding of repetition and trauma governs DeSalvo's reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, which maintains a hygienic distinction between normal/abnormal and healthy/unhealthy behaviours. DeSalvo sees Miranda's re-enactment of past trauma as a undesirable but inevitable symptom of her identity as a victim of sex abuse: "Like every victim of incest, Miranda has internalized a sense of worthlessness, a compulsion to repeat the degrading experiences that gave her both the only attention she has had as a child and the only power she had known."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> But in her longer work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Conceived with Malice</span>, DeSalvo emphasizes the therapeutic value of an apparently different kind of repetition, the writing and revising process for Barnes: "Working and reworking the story of her life gave her a certain mastery over her trauma … This was a necessary stage for her healing."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> For DeSalvo, certain kinds of repetition—the re-enactment of sexually violent and traumatic events and bad feelings associated with them—can only be the sign of a pathology, yet the therapeutic value of confession, where Barnes may situate herself as someone who has had things "done to her," is taken for granted. The distinction here may be related to the temporal difference highlighted by Daub: only when Barnes re-externalizes and historicizes what has happened through creating a narrative can healing begin. By re-enacting violence, however, she is trapped within the endless cycle of unwilled repetition. DeSalvo thus makes the distinction, identified by Cvetkovich, "between 'working through,' the successful resolution of trauma, and 'acting out,' the repetition of trauma that does not lead to transformation."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> Cvetkovich critiques this distinction by pointing not only to its apparent tautology ("good responses to trauma are cases of working through; bad ones are instances of acting out") but also by emphasising that performativity or "modes of acting out" are a crucial resource for responding to trauma.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>Even Richard Espley, who, inviting us to dwell on the play's obscurities, implicitly critiques the "working through" model suggested in the work of DeSalvo and Ann Marie Wagstaff, relies on this distinction between good and bad repetitions.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Espley argues that in such feminist biographical studies the "literary artefact becomes 'scriptotherapy,' and its very annunciation of trauma renders it a healing triumph."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> Espley accurately identifies the utopian connection between speaking out and healing, yet he ultimately dismisses the play's therapeutic value by focusing on the kind of repetitions that might be classed as "acting out" rather than "working through," such as Elisha and Dudley's violence, and Augusta and Miranda's deaths. The distinction between the two seems largely to be one of negativity versus positivity: the "hopelessly bleak plot rather questions attempts to celebrate the play as a brave rejoinder to patriarchal abuse and repression."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> The play's redemptive qualities are thus discounted because Espley cannot imagine any healing practices that incorporate negative affect. Like DeSalvo's work, Espley's essay ultimately treats the ritualized repetition of violence as an essentially bad, if inevitable, response to trauma. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Cvetkovich, conversely, considers the possibility of a "queer healing practice [that] would turn negative affect or trauma on its head, but by embracing rather than refusing it."<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Cvetkovich discusses a controversial performance by the rock group Tribe 8 that included the lead singer, Lynn Breedlove, cutting off a strapped-on dildo with a large knife while performing a song about sexual abuse survivorhood. For Cvetkovich, this performance is significant because it "blurs the distinction between pro-sex practices, sexual violence, and incest survivorhood in order to reveal that their intimate connections may be productive rather than a cause for alarm."<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup> Cvetkovich challenges the view that "acting out" trauma is necessarily harming (or a sign of harm) and suggests the "ambivalent power of repeated, and especially ritualized, violence to heal and/or perpetuate an original trauma" and claims that the "violence" of the performance can be understood as a "ritualized repetition that transforms earlier scenes of violence."<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup></p>
<p>Barnes's use of the doll's house scene to re-enact the trauma of abuse is important not just because it captures the performative dimension of traumatic memory, but because it also involves a potentially therapeutic repetition of violence, especially for Augusta, who, placed in front of the house by Elisha, sits cross-legged and childishly plays with it. Seeing Titus shrunk and "tamed," nothing but "a chip, a doll, a toy, a pawn," is a source of painful pleasure for Augusta as she plays with a "<span style="font-style:italic;">stick hung with dolls</span>" of Titus's mistresses (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 145, italics in original). This re-enactment is even more significant for Augusta because the stick in question seems to be the one with which Titus terrorized his family:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Was this the stick that leapt me, gentlemen?<br>Where now the stallion yard lay beating on the turf<br>Its whistling vent? So proud of it he was<br>He asked to be but laid beside it in the grave.<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 182)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The phallic implications of Titus's fetishized stick are clear: it is an animal's pizzle, which was historically used as a whipping instrument.<sup><a name="f90-text" href="#f90">90</a></sup> The stick that Augusta wields is therefore a symbol of the patriarch's sexual (and non-sexual) violence. In the act of possessing this stick (and feeling empowered) Augusta is re-enacting the scene of violence from the perspective of the family's abuser. As a violent ritual involving identification with a perpetrator, Augusta's actions might be compared to Tribe 8's dildo-cutting. Both rituals, while locating power in the phallus, appropriate it in such a way that the association between phallus and penis is ultimately challenged. Most importantly, the acts fuse aspects of sadism and masochism in a way that defies simple notions of victimhood: "The violence of castration," Cvetkovich notes, is directed as much at Breedlove herself "as it is externally, refusing any simple division between the subject and object of violence."<sup><a name="f91-text" href="#f91">91</a></sup> As puppet-master, Augusta acts as Titus, appropriating his power, while participating in—and sharing—his humiliation. Her actions therefore point towards the ambivalent but possibly therapeutic value of ritualized repetitions.</p>
<p>My reading of the phallic identifications of the doll's house scene contributes to an understanding of the play as a work that pre-empts the queering of the somewhat  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> polarized view of sexuality and sexual abuse evidenced in certain feminist analyses of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. And, as I have suggested, Curry's narrative of the play's editorial and revision history reiterates this gendered polarity in power and agency, while casting the existing textual corpus as interrupted, mutilated, and penetrated. Such a fantasy of original textual purity and integrity shores up the kind of sexual politics and understanding of the female body (displayed in work by Broe, DeSalvo, and Wagstaff) that Barnes's play indeed challenges. Barnes's text does not, as it were, denounce the dildo, and neither does it imagine all penetration as rape, and all rape as structurally identical and affectively unambivalent.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the text of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> was subject to ongoing revision for decades: the author herself simply could not leave the play alone, even after publication. Barnes's scribbled "corrections" may be observed in both her personal copy of the 1958 first edition, and, perhaps more surprisingly, in her copy of 1962 edition, a text that she had already had the opportunity to change.<sup><a name="f92-text" href="#f92">92</a></sup> We might therefore consider the "work" of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> as comprising living, changing documents: there is no single, stable, authoritative text.<sup><a name="f93-text" href="#f93">93</a></sup> I have stressed <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> reading of the play's textual history in order to emphasize the value of theatricality and performance in its communication of traumatic experience but, more broadly speaking, the case of Barnes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> perhaps points to the interpretative acts that produce histories of redrafting, revision, and editorship: just as the play offers multiple readings, so do the narratives about its construction, and about where its textual boundaries might be located. I have not wanted to suggest that any project to reinsert certain excisions—or at least make them available to the reader—is without value, but rather to examine some of the possible political imperatives behind the wish to "restore" <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. Whether as readers, as editors, or as readers of editorial histories, we would do well to recognize our own agency (and the role of our own politics) in making <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. By this logic one might consider T. S. Eliot in the same light as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s (fictional) contemporary feminist editor: both contribute to the notion of Barnes's play a fully socialized and unstable public text.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Barnes's most recent biographer, Phillip Herring, claims that the setting for the play is a composite of the house in which Barnes's mother Elizabeth was raised—Flore House, in Oakham, Rutland (now Leicestershire)—and the nearby manor house of Burley-on-the-Hill (<span style="font-style:italic;">Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes</span> [London: Viking, 1995], 264). Flore House had originally been a Benedictine  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> monastery built in the thirteenth century. Barnes visited Oakham in June 1936 with Emily Coleman and Peter Hoare.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>Barnes grew up in a polygamous household in the farming community of Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York State, with an eccentric father, Wald, who lived by the doctrines of free love he preached. Herring documents the various evidence relating to a sexual trauma apparently suffered by the young Djuna (<span style="font-style:italic;">Djuna</span>, 52; 268). The specific nature of the violation has been confused or forgotten but it seems that Barnes blamed her father either directly or indirectly: in one statement she apparently claims that he raped her, but elsewhere she claims he consented to her rape by a neighbour. Sexual abuse has also been identified in a series of letters written by Barnes's paternal grandmother, Zadel. Zadel's letters to the adolescent Djuna include pictures of breasts and mammary-related nicknames such as "Cuddlers" and "Pink Tops"—see, for example, Zadel Gustafson to Djuna Barnes, 11 April 1905 (Djuna Barnes Papers, Special Collections, University of Maryland, Series I, Box 6, Folder 20); 11 June 1908 and 29 September 1908 (Series I, Box 6, Folder 21).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Barnes seems to have been rather unproductive between <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, publishing only what Deborah Parsons calls the "significantly titled" "Lament for the Left Bank" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Town and Country</span> in December 1941.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>The Barnes archive contains an undated "Early Draft" of Acts 1 (Series III, Box 1, Folder 3) and 2 (Series III, Box 1, Folder 4) which, as I argue below, seem to have been written at different times. There are two similar drafts of all three acts dating from July 1954 (marked "First Copy" [Series III, Box 1, Folders 5–7] and "Finished Copy" [Series III, Box 1, Folders 8–10]); four full copies dating from September 1955, with Copy 2 (Series III, Box 1, Folders 12; 14; 16) marked as Muir's copy, and Copy 3 (Series III, Box 2, Folders 1; 3; 5) marked as Eliot's (Copies 1 [Series III, Box 1, Folders 11; 13; 15] and 2 are a slightly different typescripts from Copies 3 and 4 [Series III, Box 2, Folders 2; 4; 6]); a copy dating from February 1956 (Series III, Box 2, Folders 8–10); three copies dating from June 1956 (Series III, Box 3, Folders 7; 9; 11; Series III, Box 3, Folders 8; 10; 12; Series III, Box 4, Folders 1–3) and one copy dating from August 1956 (Series III, Box 4, Folders 5–7). These versions could be said to represent significant stages in redrafting. The archive also contains the actors' copies of the play from the May 1956 Poet's Theatre reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, along with miscellaneous pages, drafts, proofs, and notes relating to the play.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f10" href="#f10-text">10. </a>The main difference between the two published texts relates to the distribution of lines between characters.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f11" href="#f11-text">11. </a>Act 1 includes a substantial number of narrative strands and character names that were abandoned or changed early on in the dated drafts, which suggests that it is the remnant of a pre-July 1954 typescript and so the oldest surviving draft of this act. On the basis of the names and numbers of sons (and the complexity of their characters), the wording of specific lines, and references to the griffin that appears onstage, I would date Act 2 to some time between July 1954 and September 1955. This implies that there may have been another stage of redrafting in 1954/1955, with acts one and three having been lost. However, the changes between this 'undated' Act 2 and the 1955 versions are quite small, and this may not represent a full redrafting of the whole play.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>Both Muir and Eliot were keen that Barnes reduce Jack's lines—see, for example, Eliot to Barnes, 4 April 1956 (Series II, Box 4, Folder 63).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f13" href="#f13-text">13. </a>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Belle Laide</span> is referred to as "Aunt Prudence" in September 1955's Copy 1, with the name "Elvira" scored through in ink, while the name "Prudence" is scored through in copies 2,3, and 4, and in 3 and 4 replaced in ink. It seems as if this is an example of Barnes's indecisiveness about names rather than a case of two characters being condensed into one.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f14" href="#f14-text">14. </a>But, again, Barnes is inconsistent with naming in her early drafts.</p></div>

S. Eliot: Authority, Resistance, and Acquiescence," <span style="font-style:italic;">Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature</span> 12.2 : 289–313. Cheryl J. Plumb has produced a "restored" version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, reinserting the parts she claims that Eliot encouraged Barnes to excise (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood: The Original Version and Related Drafts</span> [Normal, IL: Dalkey Archive Press, 1995]). As is the case with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, access to these earlier drafts is illuminating, and an invaluable resource for the Barnes scholar. Although we might pose similar questions (to the ones I ask here in relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>) about the faith in authorial intentions and indeed the demonization of Eliot that her project involves, one crucial difference is that Plumb's work does not connect (implicitly or explicitly) the discourses of sexual and textual violation. Indeed, I would argue that a much more convincing case can be made for the significance of Eliot's censorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> than <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f29" href="#f29-text">29. </a>By "sex-negative" I am of course referring to a particular strand of second-wave feminism, reflected here in the work of DeSalvo (in particular), but most famously represented in the antipornography stances of Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, and the foundational analyses of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rape by Susan Brownmiller.

The play was performed at least three times in the nineties (all in translation), including a Paris production at the Théâtre de l'Europe in 1990 (dir. Daniel Mesguich), and a Frankfurt production in 1992. The third staging I can find evidence for was a Dutch-Belgian production in 1996—see Julie Phillips, "A Rip in Nature: Djuna Barnes's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> in Holland," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Village Voice</span> 43.3 (16 January 1996): 62.</p></div>
