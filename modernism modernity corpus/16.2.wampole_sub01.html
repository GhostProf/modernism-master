<p>Sapere, December 15, 1937</p>
<p>"At the height of his power," said Paul Valéry, "Louis XIV did not possess one one-hundredth of the dominance over nature and the means to entertain himself and exercise his own mind with the sensations that people of rather modest means possess today." The gramophone has transformed our home into a sumptuous hall where it is possible to hear the world's most beautiful concerts. Radio brings the setting and voices of public events, stadiums, and the opera stage into our living rooms. Tomorrow, television will allow us to enjoy at home what we see today on the movie screen: adventures, pleasant heroes, and faraway places.</p>
<p>The social and cultural impact of these new media is unprecedented, despite the many adversaries who defend their hostility by marshalling an array of plausible objections and who would condemn the machines we are so proud of to burning at the stake. But if idolatry of progress is a commonplace—we cite Valéry again—so is the idolatry of progress qua curse. Every new development, be it material or of the mind, is to some degree dangerous because it tends toward uncontrolled generalization. It is therefore necessary, for practical reasons among others, to define the boundaries within which a new medium can yield benefits that couldn't be attained without it, and the limits beyond which it remains inferior to traditional means.</p>
<p>No one would find it odd to praise the light bulb. But how can one deny the calm serenity that dim light brings to an absorbing conversation? The typewriter is extremely convenient. But surely we wouldn't want to see the disappearance of something as significant and personal as handwriting. Appreciating transport by car doesn't necessarily mean renouncing the joys of a stroll on foot. If the truth be known, it is not new media in themselves that are tyrannical, but rather our minds, tending as they do to reduce everything to a single formula in the name of a natural but hardly commendable idleness.</p>
<p>Something in the nature of progress seduces us to betray the values of the past. We don't know if gramophones are already playing lullabies alongside cradles. Hopefully not. Even the voice of the soprano Toti dal Monte couldn't replace a mother's voice. This is what is essential: to recognize the irreplaceability of a maternal lullaby, even as we recognize the gramophone as unprecedented.</p>
<p>So the gramophone, radio, and television require discipline and their very efficacy as instruments depends upon economical use. They are media for the concentration and elevation of the mind, reserved for rare and precious hours. For this reason, their use should remain more limited than, say, that of eye-glasses or zippers. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The gramophone, for example, requires special care in order to fulfill its capabili ties. It is not enough simply to change the needle after each record and to release the spring each time the device is shut down. First, one needs to be meticulous in the choice of records: not only because few pockets are deep enough to allow for wasteful spending, but because, like a rotten pear forgotten cast among healthy pears, the mediocre, when mixed with the good, spoils it. If we prefer Beethoven interpreted by de Sabata, why purchase a recording with a different conductor just because the salesperson recommends it? If you like Louis Armstrong's jazz music, don't take home a Jack Hylton album. Be insistent. Don't buy any album of which you aren't 100% convinced: the range of choices is so large that it is certainly always possible to find "your" album. Those who choose quickly or in a room in which four people are listening to four different records simultaneously will regret it immediately and every time they catch a glimpse of the album thereafter.</p>
<p>Never tolerate any object in your home that doesn't wholly correspond to the demands of your mind! This said, it is also important to avoid dogmatism: the inertia that often limits the choice of records to determined genres even when our personal receptive capacity could accommodate a much wider range. To embrace the facile mania and fury of the collector-purist who collects all the records belonging to a given genre and nothing else, is in fact a poor choice. Those who prefer opera singers should also have the courage to try chamber music; the jazz fanatic should be prepared to listen also to beautiful folk songs.</p>
<p>But selectivity is not enough. If the inspiration to sing or whistle a melody seizes you, the song that will most often come to your lips is one appropriate to the "atmosphere" of the moment. The record, however, is not a product of the moment and, for this reason, it has the potential to become unbearable when played in a different time and place. Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tristan</span> is not for summer mornings. And when your guests have become giddy from drinking wine, it would be unsuitable to play the Palestrina Chorus; just as it would be indiscrete and even useless to interrupt an animated and perhaps too lengthy philosophical discussion with a new song by Ginger Rogers. Turn to the gramophone when the conversation falls silent and choose a record that suits your guests and their mood. Never impose a record, even an excellent one purchased the day before, at all costs. Once the gramophone is playing, however, you must offer it the same courtesy owed a human being: when the music speaks, others should be quiet and listen—a practice it is important to communicate to children. This of course becomes possible only when every now and then, instead of playing the gramophone for hours on end, people are discretely allowed to chat, to sing, and to pull out an old violin—if there is one –from the cabinet, or a good book from the library.</p>
<p>The gramophone requires an act of choice; radio allows for choice but doesn't demand it. If you are so inclined, you can simply rotate the dial through a sequence of random stations until you decide to stop. There are those who turn on the radio just after returning home from the office and do not turn it off until the last station goes off the air for the night. There are those who are no longer capable of reading the newspaper without words, songs, or laughter from the radio. This is a symptom of mental laxity and nervousness that destroys every possibility for genuine attention and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  artistic enjoyment. Used in this way, the radio becomes a tyrant that suffocates every form of human activity and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Radio, however, can become a precious instrument when we take full advantage of its unique and irreplaceable features. There is no faster way to bring the latest news home than electric waves. But editorials are better suited to newspapers and essays to magazines, because one can read more attentively as a function of one's speed of comprehension, which varies from reader to reader. When a speech by an important person is broadcast on the radio, you very quickly make his acquaintance. Listen to his voice and, for the rest of your life, you will understand his works and actions more adequately. The radio allows you to learn languages: take advantage of this opportunity, since no manual will allow you to hear accent and pronunciation. But you must not listen distractedly as you perform other actions. He who becomes accustomed to half listening fools himself into believing that he has lived his life in full when has only half lived, as it were, through a single ear. It is precisely the radio's tolerance for all sorts of distraction, which is only rarely punished, that underscores the need for self-discipline.</p>
<p>Just as your record collection is an expression of your tastes, let radio programs be a place for experimentation. You will probably never buy a record of Japanese music. But if the radio offers you a concert from Tokyo, listen to see if your spirit is open to this unfamiliar experience. A lecture on an issue in which you've never taken an interest could provide you with an unexpected perspective. If the lecture engages you, go on to deepen your knowledge through books, for it is an illusion to believe that radio programs, limited as they are to presenting diverse topics in quick succession, can offer more than an introduction. Having a superficial knowledge in all fields does not mean possessing encyclopedic knowledge: rather, it characterizes the type of person who talks about everything but knows nothing.</p>
<p>Radio programming cannot be "organic" like a concert or a magazine. It offers a classical music concert followed by a sequence of dance music, not because these two genres go together but because while you listen with pleasure to Casella, a listener on another floor is waiting to dance. Don't forget your neighbors. Radio offers the possibility for a magnificent apprenticeship in demonstrating due respect to those around you. Blasting the speaker so loudly that it shrieks like a jungle full of wild beasts shows a lack of consideration, for there are those who would prefer to have their rugs and jewels stolen in silence, which is a necessary precondition for rest, reflection, and work. Furthermore, it is erroneous to believe the louder the volume, the sharper the sound. Physiology teaches us that past a certain threshold, acoustic sensations become painful and that continuous noise fatigues the nerves. If the human voice is over-amplified, it loses its character, and music loses its meaning. And a man who lives only through the superlative becomes poor because he no longer has the crescendo at his disposal.</p>
<p>The time has come to also briefly mention the telephone. Like a voice on the radio, a phone voice also emanates from afar and, for this reason, one who calls can't always be certain they'll be well received. Nevertheless, it is always possible to demonstrate a certain "respect" accorded to the recipient of the call. On this subject, radio, addressed <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as it is to all, must follow common sense rules: for example, not broadcasting the latest news at three in the morning. But when one calls a friend whose daily routine, character, and current circumstances are more or less known by the caller, one can at least avoid calling during the hours of work, sleep, or meals. Living with others presupposes that each person be allowed a few hours of discrete solitude. Because the telephone has rendered the walls of our houses invisible and the doorman's obstinacy useless, it should for these very reasons be used sparingly.</p>
<p>Still, there are those who cannot resist the ring of the telephone, shrill as it is, even in the moments least appropriate for phone calls. A device that could temporarily suspend all calls, somehow informing the caller that the recipient would welcome the call at another time, would surely make a profit. But a partial remedy can be imagined without any special recourse to technology: keeping telephones far away from desks, dining rooms, or beds. At home, phone calls should always be answered by the person who is least busy at the moment, and no one should be offended by the polite request to postpone a call. Only in this way can the possibility of communicating at a distance at any time and with anyone be considered an genuine advancement. In some cases, it might be nice to be able to exchange words with a far-away friend every half hour. In others, it might be pleasurable for both speaker and listener to have a lengthy conversation, whether practical in nature or not. But there can be little doubt that finding a line continually busy when one needs to make an urgent, practical, necessary call can drive somebody crazy. The truth of the matter is that telephoning is a delicious vice: not so delicious, however, that one can't schedule an appointment between two businessmen, or pack a twenty-minute conversation and all the preambles of a formal letter into a few moments. Using a telephone may appear self-evident. But there are those who in the span of their lifetime are fated never to learn.</p>
<p>Within a few short years, we will be able to sit before the television screen and witness political meetings, horse races, and film projections in the privacy of our homes. In some respects, the discipline required by the medium of television will be greater than that required by the radio, because the former will engage not only our hearing but also our vision (which, currently idle, can busy itself with other distractions, drawing our attention away from the act of audition). In others respects, much like its counterparts, this new medium will prove valuable only when approached with discretion. The gramophone and the radio rely on hearing; they employ abstract means, such as language and music. Television allows the direct witnessing from home of the scope and scale of things and events. It will give rise to the same criticisms once leveled at the cinema. Everyone recognizes film's contributions to culture and the arts. But it is no less obvious that the cinema can also seduce us with crude and frivolous amusements.</p>
<p>Radio programs contain very little in the way of immediately palpable reality or raw material. Consequently, radio—as a more restrictive medium dominated by the concepts that accompany words and by the indeterminate emotions prompted by music—is endowed with a higher spiritual character than are films. Will radio lose ground when image and sound are combined in our homes? Undoubtedly, such a danger can't be excluded. It is precisely for this reason that we must anticipate the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  future need to discipline this new instrument so as to exalt its positive and eliminate its negative effects.</p>
<p>Like Goethe's sorcerer's apprentice, man, the ruler of space and time, whose voice now crosses oceans and whose ears now enjoy the songs of artists buried long ago, runs the risk of losing sovereignty over the great minds that have been placed in his service unless he exercises his will against the seductions of inertia and passivity. The freedoms associated with these most powerful tools of our times can be achieved only though the rigorous disciplining of our needs and desires. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
