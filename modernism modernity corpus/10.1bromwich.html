<p>
I owe much to Ronald Schuchard's earlier work on Eliot, and this
essay makes a new reason for gratitude. It draws many remarkable
connections between Eliot's life and his treatment of Jews in person
and in poetry. Since I disagree with some of Schuchard's conclusions,
let me start by summarizing what I take the essay to establish beyond a
doubt. Eliot looked at the Jews under three almost separate aspects: as a
religion which he respected at a distance; as a scattering of unaffiliated
individuals, part of the urban human debris which he loved and feared
and out of which he made poetry; and as a religion-turned-culture, an
ethical climate of feeling gradually defining itself in secular language,
a tributary of the protestant freethinking which Eliot saw as the essence
of the disintegrative spirit of modernity. Sometimes, in addressing Jews
whom he knew well, Eliot tried to reason with this remnant, to argue them
back into a semblance of their proper religious attachment. This was a
very odd business&#8212;something Schuchard refrains from saying. During
his last years, Eliot was conducting his own conversion of the Jews back
to Judaism. There is a note of muffled humility and sanctimony unique
to him in the pathetic exclamation to Victor Gollancz: "You seem to have
to me enough of Judaism in you to qualify as a Jew in my sight!" 

<p>
Schuchard's account is shaded by a certain tenderness toward Eliot. We are
told that he "arrived in London by mischance in August 1914," though his
chances were rather good, and that he "took refuge" in Merton College,
as if he were one more refugee . A surplus of tenderness may be
necessary if one is to judge kindly the harsh things Eliot said about
the Jews in the

<b></b>

first three decades of his career, from which he retreated in the last two
decades. Perfect anti-Semites are rare, and Eliot was not one of them. He
was friendly or respectful to many Jews, and, during the Second World
War, an active force for assistance to Jewish emigrants. Eliot practiced
better than he preached. Fortunately, the history of prejudice is full
of similar examples. Unfortunately, it is worse in some ways to preach
than to practice intolerance. You do more harm than good in proportion
as your words outrun your actions. But let us distinguish between
kinds of anti-Semitism. There is the anti-Semitism of exclusive clubs
and restrictive covenants; and there is the anti-Semitism of pogroms
and the Holocaust. Belloc, Chesterton, Wharton, Fitzgerald, all had
a stake in anti-Semitism of the first kind, and a story like Saki's
"The Unrest-Cure" depends on the forbidden richness and hilarity of
the very idea of passing from prejudice to persecution. Ezra Pound in
the 1940s became a convert to anti-Semitism of the second kind. Eliot
was closer to Saki, though more obsessed than most of his type, and he
never crossed into persecution. As he turned away from those who did,
he was occasionally startled by reminders of the distinctness of his own
anti-Semitism, which in its context had been neither murderous nor benign.

<p>
Sidney Schiff, John Rodker, Jacob Isaacs, Mark Gertler, Ada
Leverson&#8212;concerning these Jews and others, Schuchard remarks that
Eliot "moved in their company" . I take that uncontroversially as
part of the record. The same holds for his later and less guild-centered
friendships with George Boas, Benjamin Cardozo, Horace M. Kallen, and
Groucho Marx. His championing of Isaac Rosenberg really belongs in a
separate category&#8212;it exhibits in a high degree the generosity of
disinterested judgment. For the rest, it was impossible in the twentieth
century to cherish a deep interest in art without moving in the company
of a large number of free-thinking Jews. Many, after all, were patrons
of the avant-garde, many were champions of particular artists, many were
artists themselves. That Eliot could claim Jews among his friends in no
way disposes of the moral and political charge that he took a mischievous
interest in "the Jews." He did take such a mischievous interest: that
much seems equally uncontroversial, and it is the reasonable reply
to the frivolous shallowness of his disclaimer in a letter to Edward
Field, "I am no more anti-semitic than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo"
. Nobody would think him anti-Eskimo because he never took that kind
of interest in the Eskimos. For reasons of reticence more than self-doubt,
he avoided giving argumentative shape to his reservations about the
Jews, but pretty plainly the idea was this. Religions, in modernity,
have suffered dissolution into the chaos of an enlightened utilitarian
democratic culture that does not deserve the name of culture. Only in
their integrity as religions do they contribute to civilization. Jews
pose a special danger because they were the first to pass from docile
belief to free thinking, mobility, and skepticism. In this, they are a
pattern for such later unbelievers as Eliot's Unitarian ancestors&#8212;a
connection pointed out by William Empson in his review of the facsimile
<i>Waste Land</i>.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
The Jewish presence in "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar"
makes sense in this setting, and Schuchard's exegesis of that poem reminds
me a little of an analysis I heard William Arrowsmith offer once, at a
Trilling Seminar at Columbia 

<b></b>

University some two decades ago.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 This line of ingenious apologetics I believe Eliot's poetry neither
 solicits nor rewards. An eye protrudes from a face, not from the
 waters of a canal, because that is how the word works in English. As
 for surrealism, it is an excuse that soon wears thin, and, applied to
 Eliot's practice in the quatrain poems, it can only mean that he was
 using people according to imagist doctrine for their hard dry outlines,
 as if they were bits of tessellated stone in a mosaic. Such dehumanizing
 tactics were challenged by a few early readers (Robert Graves, for one)
 not fully imbued with the modernist precept that favors malice as a
 purgative against the "spilt religion" of liberalism.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Anyway, Eliot's practice defies a purely aesthetic defense, owing to
 a difference, overlooked by him and others, between what is possible
 in painting and sculpture and what is possible with words. If Picasso
 or Modigliani shows an African or a Jewish face, as most people have
 experienced such a face, primitive rendering may make the familiar
 image real while drawing effectively on the type. It is not the same
 for the word-artist who tries out the dead word <i>jew</i> hoping
 to make it even deader and more primitive by the underemphasis of
 lowercase lettering. The word will insist on its own life: it has a
 previous moral history that remains active as part of its substantial
 meaning. So the worker in words, because words are universals, is
 indebted to common usage in a way that the inventor or imitator of
 an image is not. Eliot wanted to trade on the advantage of words for
 abstraction, without paying this debt. He was granted his wish in the
 short run. The poem was admired, the jew was permitted. Eventually,
 the history of more than a word overtook him.

<p>
"Gerontion" is characterized by Schuchard as a successful effort of
sympathy with the displaced people of modernity. "Part Hebrew, part
Hellene," Gerontion "sees in the window of his decayed European house a
squatting Jewish landlord, a modern counterpart of Shylock, once again
pushed with his people from nation to nation, from ghetto to ghetto,
'Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London,' fleeing the
horrific pogroms in Poland during the peace process" . An eloquent
description, but of what poem? The words "blistered," "patched," and
"peeled" could conceivably be used by an artist intent on evoking pity,
but if pity and sympathy were your object I doubt that you would select
those words. This Jew's body has been marked and scabbed by a loathsome
disease. The disease will be taken by many readers as a metaphor for a
corruption the man as a type exhibits. Yet by splicing together phrases of
the poem with a montage of the brutal postwar re-organization of Europe,
Schuchard is able to conjure up sympathy for the casualties of the war
and its aftermath, as if Gerontion and the Jew alike were among the
casualties. Where evidence is not in question, one can only register a
contrary intuition. Sympathy with the mass of the stateless cast up by
the war does not seem to me the tenor of "Gerontion."

<p>
We would not be trying to explain any of this if Eliot had not added an
apparent explanation of his own. "Reasons of race and religion combine to
make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable" . He later
professed not to know what he could have meant by the words. But were they
such a lapse, for him? Eliot for a long time found nothing extraordinary
in this utterance. He wrote it, read it aloud to an audience, reread it
when preparing <i>After Strange Gods</i> for press, and approved it

<b></b>

again when he corrected proofs. It is a clipped phrase in his best
manner; and some obvious circumstances explain it. The words were
spoken in 1933, in the American South. In polite company, in America,
anti-Semitism was hardly then the proscribed sentiment it would become
two decades later. Cultural doctrine aside, Eliot was paying a compliment
to his Virginia hosts by sharing one of their prejudices and giving it
a gloss of dignified impartiality. The curious word <i>race</i> comes
into the sentiment partly again because of the Virginia setting. Jews
and Christians, Negroes and white people&#8212;in both cases, the
mixing is undesirable, and the usage of "race" for the first pair
brings in the second tacitly. The remark is a piece of genteel
segregationist fellow-feeling. Later, Eliot would say that race
"ought not" to matter between Christians and Jews. Fine words "ought
not." But barring a millennial world-wide conversion to Christianity,
Eliot favored preservation of the two religions, or races, in their
separate integrity. Nowhere does he come close to saying that the only
race that matters to him is the human race.

<p>
Against this background, his "keen admiration" for the state of Israel,
in a letter of 1963 to Groucho Marx, need not be taken as ironic, but
its meaning is hardly transparent . What kind of place did Eliot
suppose the Israel of David Ben-Gurion to be? It contained, he knew,
plenty of Sephardic Jews, whom he preferred to other kinds of Jews. He
probably did not imagine it as a country full of utopian-socialist
experiments. He could not have thought it "the true heart of Europe"
in the sense Milan Kundera would later intend.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Schuchard offers a fair clue to the function of Israel in the mind of
 Eliot when he quotes from an essay of 1944 on "The Responsibility
 of the Man of Letters and the Cultural Restoration of Europe"
 . Eliot was speaking there about the heritage of Greece and
 Rome. Characteristically, rather than merely omit Israel, he said some
 explicit words about why Israel must be omitted. The train of thought
 in the essay is Arnoldian: a Hebraic emphasis on law and conduct,
 by definition, runs counter to the purposes of culture. There
 is, of course, an ancient alliance between philhellenism and
 anti-Semitism&#8212;to which Lionel Gossman some years ago devoted an
 enthralling essay&#8212;but I do not think Eliot was on its trail in
 1944, if he ever was.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Eliot's strictures of 1944 are important chiefly as a reminder. When
 he talks about the Jews, he always has a particular sense and a
 motive&#8212;even if he will later claim not to "know what my mind
 was." The longer he thinks, the surer he becomes of the necessity of
 excluding Jews, or free-thinking Jews, or Israel in some sense of
 the word, from his idea of Christian culture or civilization. What
 changed over time were the ways in which a sane person with Jewish
 friends could plausibly say or hint at such things.
