<p class="noIndent">
Gertrude Stein returned to the United States in 1934, a year of fierce debate over the Federal Communications Act and the regulation of American radio. As she explored the nation that res so prominently in her writings, she could not have missed the fact that radio broadcasting had captured the imaginations of Americans. Stein had long been an avid reader and critic of popular culture and the media&#x02014;her relationship with American newspapers predated her late romance with the radio. However, the influence of mass-media forms upon her writing has yet to be fully explored. In what follows I will demonstrate that radio in particular acted as a powerful formal model for Stein's late writing.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 

<p>
Radio's influence can be traced in Stein's political and aesthetic strategies during her American tour, and it emerges as a dominant note in her World War II texts.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Broadcasting provides a suggestive means of connecting Stein's early aural experimentalism (as in the multiple, echoing voices of "Bon Marche Weather") with her later, more popular, idiom. Resolutely oral, dialogic, and changeable, Stein's artistic project finally finds its formal corollary in mid-century radio. Tracing the influence of the radio in Stein's late writing also makes it possible to extend our analysis of Stein's use of indeterminacy in language to her more audience-focused texts, with the effect of complicating our readings of her investment in communication and communal meaning-making. Through the 1930s and 1940s, Stein wrestles with the idea of radio as a kind of public sphere&#x02014;a forum in which self, other, and community can be constituted through talk. Her aurality must thus be understood as being as profoundly public in its orientations as it is private.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Finally, hearing the radio in Stein's late writing advances our understanding of the 


<b></b>


cross-fertilizations of "high" and "low" modernist cultures, while beginning to acknowledge radio's own distinct thematic and stylistic contributions to mid-century modernism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein was not alone in responding powerfully to radio. By the time Stein returned to the United States for her lecture tour of the mid-1930s, radio had been the subject of a powerful discourse of technological utopianism for more than a decade.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Radio had promised, according to its very earliest boosters, to bring together the geographically and culturally scattered nation. Respected thinkers such as John Dewey, Herbert Cooley, and Robert Park believed that radio offered the means to create a new public united by channels of communication.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In an extreme version of such claims, the League of Political Education asserted (somewhat ominously) in 1938 that the broadening "psychological gaps" between Americans could be overcome through the radio, which fostered a "simultaneous process of thinking."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's "Fireside Chats" were just one way in which radio was used to call a national community into being. As Lizabeth Cohen has shown in her study of Depression-era workers in Chicago, the claims of radio boosters were not spurious: by facilitating alliances between disparate ethnic groups during the 1930s, radio helped to bring about a self-conscious community of American working people.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Broadcasting seemed to be unstoppable in its promotion of social connection. 

<p>
Why would Stein respond to such a potentially overbearing program of social connection? By the mid-1930s she had become more aware of social connection as an intellectual problem. As she explains in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> , <i>The Making of Americans</i>  was an effort to write a history of "every individual person" and the relations between those individuals. However, Stein claims that in the 1930s "individual anything as related to every other individual" is no longer interesting:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
now since the earth is all covered over with every one there is really no relation between any one and so if this Everybody's Autobiography is to be the autobiography of every one it is not to be of any connection between any one and any one because now there is none.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Mass society has led to anything but mass culture, if we are to believe that no relations exist for <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> to map. However, Stein's insistence on "everybody" and "every one" asserts the continuing power of the language of the social. Her texts of the 1930s will turn away from relations between "any one and any one" to explore new mass forms of connection.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 

<p>
As Stein writes in "I Came and Here I Am," published in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> in February 1936, American radio suggests a new form that enables her to extend the explorations of her earlier texts:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In writing in <i>The Making of Americans</i> I said I write for myself and strangers and this is what broadcasting is. I write for myself and strangers. . . . I had never heard a broadcasting; that is I had never listened to one and I certainly had never thought of doing one, and this is the way the thing that I like best of all the things I have never done before, was done . . . we sat down one on either side of the little thing that was between us and I said something and they said that is all, and then suddenly it was all going on. It was it was 


<b></b>


really all going on, and it was, it really was, as if you were saying what you were saying and you knew, you really knew, not by what you knew but by what you felt, that everybody was listening. It is a very wonderful thing to do, I almost stopped and said it, I was so filled with it. And then it was over and I never had liked anything as I had liked it.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Broadcasting fills Stein with the feeling of everybody&#x02014;of everybody listening. Radio creates the everybody by creating the audience, a kind of community that understands itself as existing in (varying) relation to a mass medium.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  However, this audience is not passive, nor is the broadcast unidirectional; as Stein's voice fills the airwaves she in turn is filled by listening. The radio broadcast conveys a sense of an immediate and concentrated present; it begins again and again, as Stein's characteristically insistent phrasings indicate to us. It applies itself to representational questions that Stein's writing had been addressing for the three preceding decades. As she proclaims to the readership of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, Stein is smitten with the distinct form of connection that the radio seems capable of performing.

<p>
The <i>Cosmopolitan</i> article represents the enjoyment of broadcasting as constituted by a distinct kind of knowledge, knowing "by what you felt." That is, the appeal of the radio is not exclusively informational, but extends intellectually, just as it does physically, into more intimate and emotional territory. Stein's experience of the America of radio evangelist Father Coughlin would have made this extension clear. The emotional appeals of the radio form would achieve dominance in the United States by the late 1930s and early 1940s, when the threat of war made strongly-felt connection and communication across the geographic and cultural divides of the United States seem even more imperative. As the American war machine engaged, pundits assigned the radio a central role in the creation and maintenance of "national morale." Radio assumed this central role by dint of its distinctive form of address, according to James Rowland Angell of NBC. He attributed the medium's influence to: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
 the immediacy of its conveyance of news;  the vast mass of persons thus reached, many of them having only delayed access, if any, to the newspapers, and not a few being unused to reading, or incapable of it;  <i>the psychological appeal of the living human voice as contrasted with cold type</i>&#x02014;even when accompanied with the barrage of photographs now so universally employed by the press 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(my emphasis).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Stein's writing of this period also explores radio's distinctive formal command over the emotions. In <i>Ida</i> , after having drifted without affect through a series of spaces, occupations, and husbands, Ida hears the national anthem on the radio and cries.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In this scene, the radio's appeal is so immediate that it results in a disproportionate response. Ironically, the "living voice" reproduced by the radio has greater access to and effect upon Ida than do most of the truly living voices around her. Ida is a guarded public re, but this medium penetrates her reserve. While the content conveyed by the radio in this case is clearly public and nationalistic, its form grants it a level of access unparalleled in its intimacy. Accordingly, this medium generates private feeling and directs it into public channels. It recouples the emotional and intellectual responses to truth, and in the process, redefines truth.


<b></b>


<p>
When it operates in this way, the radio formalizes a response to expression that Stein considered essential to the understanding of her work. In a 1937 radio interview, Stein explains that the reader accesses what her writing is about when he or she responds to it with enjoyment: "The reader does know [what Stein is thinking about] because he enjoys it. If you enjoy you understand if you understand you enjoy. What you mean by understanding is being able to turn it into other words but that is not necessary."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Stein here distinguishes the interviewer's translation-as-understanding from her own response-as-understanding. Response does not entail a re-transcription, but is a creative act. Stein's version of understanding extends beyond intellectual engagement with the linguistic. It puts the reader in a less passive position by requiring his or her emotional participation in a communal creation of the meaning of the material.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 

<p>
Participation of this sort was increasingly expected from radio audiences in the 1930s. One of Stein's longtime correspondents, the "Kiddie" (William G. Rogers, a doughboy from World War I) described in a letter to her the natural impulse to respond that he experienced while listening, in a lunch room, to one of her radio broadcasts: "we heard you very plainly for a couple of minutes and I wanted to interrupt and say hello," he confided.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Much of the correspondence that FDR received from Depression-era Americans was in response to the intimate "conversations" started in his "Fireside Chats." Quiz shows such as <i>Vox Pop</i> demanded the participation of the audience in answering questions on the broadcast and in suggesting questions by correspondence. Another booming segment of the radio market was devoted to discussion shows, including the extremely popular <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, which aired weekly on NBC from mid-1935. Stein left the United States before <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> began broadcasting, but she would sample its cultural effects on the GIs whom she encountered at the end of World War II. Her extended relationship with the University of Chicago academic community (chronicled in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> and represented by the lectures collected in <i>Narration</i>) makes it likely that she was also familiar with another successful radio discussion program that ran weekly on NBC from 1933, the <i>University of Chicago Round Table</i>. Indeed, the discussions that Stein describes (in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>) having at the University of Chicago suggest that she was casting her very own University of Chicago round table. 

<p>
The discussion programs of the 1930s (both major radio networks, NBC and CBS, ran several) were particularly provocative in their approach to audience participation. Not unlike Stein's writing, these programs attempted to reorient audience enjoyment away from the certainty of conventional knowing. Surprisingly, the marketing strategies of the major discussion programs trumpeted their cultivation of intellectual complication, something that we more easily associate with Stein's avant-gardism.

America's Town Meeting of the Air
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>


<p>
George Denny, the founder of the popular <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, claimed to have conceived the show out of dissatisfaction with a neighbor who "would rather be shot than caught listening to Roosevelt on the radio," who "just won't listen. 


<b></b>


Even with the radio right there in his room and a chance to hear what the other side has to say for itself, he deliberately closes his mind."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  According to Denny, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> was meant to access the energy the neighbor put into seeking out familiar perspectives, and shift it outward. The program intended to market difference of opinion to the nation, and it employed the unique access of radio to do so. It traveled around the country recording its broadcasts, in order to ensure diverse representation. An episode consisted of a series of advocates addressing a central topic from their different perspectives (the first broadcast, May 30, 1935, heard from proponents of fascism, communism, socialism, and democracy in response to the question "Which Way America?"), followed by questions and responses from the audience. 

<p>
The incorporation of the audience into the discussion form was particularly effective at troubling the division between performance and audience and at undermining the notion that the masses passively consumed mediated content. Harry and Bonaro Overstreet's book-length study of the program, <i>Town Meeting Comes to Town</i> , celebrates Denny's radio program as the ultimate exploration of the radio's capacity in this endeavor. According to the Overstreets, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> was designed to put the emotional immediacy and intimate access of the radio to the service of public discussion; it would circumvent audience leanings toward the familiar and comfortable and insist upon multiple, irresolvable perspectives. That is, according to the Overstreets, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> represented a kind of participatory radio that recouples emotional and intellectual engagement, just as Stein's writing does.

<p>
Indeed, most of those involved with the program seemed to consider the volume of mail generated by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> a critical indicator of its success. George Denny proudly asserted that the very first broadcast "brought in a flood of three thousand letters."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Franklin Dunham of NBC cited with pride the 100,000 letters that NBC received for <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> in 1937.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Jeanette Sayre, research assistant to the Princeton Radio Research Project and the <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i>, published one of the first academic studies of radio fan-mail analysis.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Overstreets' study goes further and cites extensively from the correspondence received by the program. Responses from schoolteachers and ex-soldiers, city-dwellers and residents of remote rural areas, stretch over numerous pages of their book. The use of quotation in <i>Town Meeting Comes to Town</i> extends beyond the presentation of evidence. Instead, the Overstreets seem to imply that the program's inclusiveness of a diversity of voices is a formal approach that breeds such inclusiveness in those who come into contact with it. They are no longer satisfied with referencing other voices; instead, they must hear them and allow them to be heard.

<p>
According to George Denny, the "audience-participation angle" was what was new and exciting about <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>. Indeed, in his writing about the program, description of its audience-participation shifts seamlessly to a discussion of the discussion groups spawned by the program, in which the audience-participation angle is far extended:


<b></b>


<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
From the first this program began to elicit mail telling of listening groups that had been formed in schools, colleges, churches, clubs, and by all kinds of organizations. One group met on Thursday nights in the back of a drugstore in Provincetown, Massachusetts; others met in the homes of neighbors and friends. Interest extended to Canada, where a group of trappers met each week in far-off Engen, British Columbia. . . . There are now more than a thousand groups registered with Town Hall, but according to an estimate made by Frank E. Hill, field representative of the American Association for Adult Education, there are more than three thousand groups of various sizes which meet regularly and listen to the Town Meeting of the Air on Thursday nights and continue their discussion afterward.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Audience" as conceived by this program and its proponents was a role that involved active commitment and engagement without a clear conclusion. The program acted as a formal model that could then be adapted and redeployed on a continuing basis in a multitude of settings.

<p>
According to these writers, radio was negotiating a new kind of public sphere, one constantly spinning off unpredictable micro-versions. The idea of a public sphere was important to Stein, especially in the 1930s and 1940s; it res in her depiction of salon culture in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and her discussions of "publicity" in her post-American-tour writings. During the 1930s, radio seemed to promise to serve as an aural version of the "face-to-face communities" that John Dewey looked to in <i>The Public and Its Problems</i> for the reinvigoration of twentieth century participatory democracy.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
According to Nancy Fraser, some version of Habermas's public sphere and the public constituted through it remains critical to ideas of democracy. However, as Fraser makes clear, the public sphere as traditionally conceptualized is inadequately attuned to social inequality; her theorization of "subaltern counterpublics" suggests that "participatory parity" is more likely to be achieved in the context of a plurality of publics.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Radio, especially as it became dominated by networks in the 1930s, has understandably been seen as presupposing the inadequately flexible, homogeneous public sphere that Fraser, among others, critiques. What remains underexplored is the degree to which radio of the 1930s was aware of these deficiencies and attempted to address them. All of the marketing noise generated by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> does suggest that at least an appearance of mobility among the diverse and heterogeneous publics making up the United States of the 1930s was in the program's commercial interests. 

<p>
In fact, the understanding of the cultural work done by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> put forward by the Overstreets is not unlike the understanding of the cultural work done by late-twentieth-century TV talk shows recently put forward by the Mass Media Group of the Committee for Cultural Studies at the City University of New York. According to this group, late-twentieth-century TV talk shows "constitute a 'contested space' in which new discursive practices are developed in contrast to the traditional modes of political and ideological representation."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Recent TV talk shows, according to the Mass Media Group, are constructed around the audience and its response 


<b></b>


to a central topic; they are radically inconclusive; their approach is therapeutic rather than cognitive. In their quest for a lively exchange, they become a site for the circulation of alternative discursive practices. Of course, radio programs such as <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> hewed more faithfully to the traditional debate format than does Sally Jesse Raphael. However, the discourse surrounding the radio program suggests that it considered the cognitive and the therapeutic approaches to be inextricable; <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> was therapy for American democracy. Certainly, <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> was inconclusive and considered the audience the primary player in its dramas. As such, it must be understood as attempting an early version of a mass-media "contested space" public sphere.

<p>
In a radio broadcast made at Lyon in 1945, based on her experience of wartime Europe, Stein asserted the importance of the radio in bringing different voices together: "Ecoutez le radio. On ne pouvez pas imaginer d'entendre parler au radio l'esperanto. Non c'est ce qu'il nous interesse au radio c'est la multiplicite des langues. que chacqu'un cree d'une facon vibrante en son propre langue [sic]."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Broadcasters of the 1930s and 1940s were also insistent that American radio was fundamentally democratic in its aims and its techniques. In a <i>Public Opinion Quarterly</i> special supplement on "Public Opinion in a Democracy," published in 1938, spokesmen for both major American networks underlined their networks' commitment to the representation of a diversity of opinion. NBC's Franklin Dunham wrote that "Radio honestly strives to present not only two points of view on any subject brought to its forums, but as many points of view as there are, or at least as can be made articulate" ("DR," 77). His equivalent at CBS, Sterling Fisher, similarly insisted that "In general, it is the policy of the radio to present as many important and varied views as possible."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The networks were anxious to present the radio as adaptable to an unlimited range of audiences, modernistically adopting and discarding forms and discourses from hour to hour. 

<p>
Of course, as many thinkers of the period pointed out, the pronouncements of network representatives are an inadequate basis for a judgment of the medium's performance in the 1930s. Thomas H. Reed, a prominent scholar of government and member of the National Municipal League, believed that the commercial motives of major networks precluded effective education, civic or otherwise, on their parts.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As radio scholars have recently shown, ethnic and racial diversity was increasingly squeezed off the airwaves with the expansion of network control in the 1930s (<i>RV</i>, 1-33, 75-96).<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  And yet the insistence of contemporary rhetoric upon the diversity represented on the radio remains an important and intriguing key to understanding the role of radio in the 1930s and 1940s. Regardless of the accuracy of the networks' claims for diversity, the idea of diversity clearly remained of great value to them.

<p>
Even Stein may have recognized the split between the theory of diversity on the American airwaves and its reality. In fact, by the 1940s she was listening to American propaganda in occupied France, and diversity was clearly only one of radio's many claims whose correspondence with reality were questionable. Stein probably appreciated the radio's failure to restrict its claims to demonstrable realities. The strain of aurality in her work had always been that which most resisted realistic reading. (Indeed,


<b></b>


the very degree to which aurality seems to resist theorization even today would, for Stein, seem immensely exciting.) For her, the formal and representational possibilities of radio arose from the fact that the medium was less tethered to straightforward realism (and thus possibly more open to alternate "realities") than were other popular media. 

<p>
Photography, for example, seemed to demand faithful reproduction of a kind not expected in radio. In <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>, Stein ironically recounts a photographic session in the United States. Resisting miscasting by the photographer, she insists on only adopting poses of activities she actually performs:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Alright I said what do you want me to do. Why he said there is your airplane bag suppose you unpack it, oh I said Miss Toklas always does that oh no I could not do that, well he said there is the telephone suppose you telephone well I said yes but I never do Miss Toklas always does that, well he said what can you do, well I said I can put my hat on and take it off and I can put my coat on and I can take it off and I like water I can drink a glass of water . . . 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Stein's comical insistence reflects the realistic representational agenda she has assigned to the photographic medium. 

<p>
On the radio, however, in conversations both scripted and improvisational, much as her ever-changing lectures were, Stein mounted a far more playful performance. Her radio talk is more continuous with the experimentation with voice that characterizes <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> . At the end of <i>Alice B. Toklas</i>, Stein's and Toklas's voices uncannily interpenetrate, suggesting a far greater flexibility of identities than do the strictly demarcated roles available to Stein in photographs. Radio's aurality appears to enable it to resist the American desire "to make everything something anybody can see by looking" (<i>EA</i>,168). The self mediated by radio is not something anybody can see by looking&#x02014;it is a supple and ever-changing performance. The "face-to-face" community enabled by the radio is rather an "ear-to-mouth-to-ear-to-mouth" one&#x02014;more complex and chaotic and more formally and intellectually promising.

<p>
The influence of the form of radio upon Stein's work is felt nowhere more powerfully than in her last major work, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> . <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> is constructed as a series of conversations between GIs. However, it is not one of Stein's plays&#x02014;that is, it is a vocal performance that is not meant to be embodied. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> takes up Stein's preoccupation with the capacity of voice to mediate social connection. In <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> Stein assumed a down-home, intimate voice that would have broad appeal and thus engineer far-reaching social connection. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> goes beyond the salon setting of <i>Alice B. Toklas</i> to represent a rootless public <i>performance</i> of connection. The performance of connection in <i>Brewsie</i> 


<b></b>


<i>and Willie</i> is multiple, in multiple senses: it involves many voices; it involves conflicting interpretations; it involves multiple occurrences (a late version of Stein's "beginning again and again"). That is, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> resembles a form popularized by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>. 

<p>
<i>Brewsie and Willie</i> is itself a cultural study, taking its form from the differences that Stein observed between the GIs of 1944 and the doughboys of 1918. In <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> , Stein explains the difference between the two American armies as one verbal performance. The doughboys would drink silently or tell stories. The American army of 1944 "conversed, it talked it listened, and each one of them had something to say."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The American turn to talk that Stein celebrates in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> cannot be exclusively attributed to the influence of radio. However, the radio is suggested by the GIs as a possible source of their new talkativeness: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
they all agreed that the depression had a lot to do with it, it made people stay at home because they had no money to go out with, all the same said some of them that military service that they did before we came into the war had something to do with it, it kind of sobered everybody up, kind of made them feel what it was to get ready. Some of them said the radio had a lot to do with it, they got the habit of listening to information, and then the quizzes that the radio used to give kind of made them feel that it was no use just being ignorant, and then some of them said crossword puzzles had a lot to do with it.

</div>


<p class="noIndent">
The GIs' attempt to explain their conversational style in <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> presents the radio as both a source of information and (through the quiz show) a site of questioning. These GIs questioned by Stein explain their own capacity for conversation at least in part by recourse to their radio listening skills&#x02014;in this they follow Franklin Dunham of NBC's description of the role of the audience as to "'respond' or listen," which equates the two acts ("DR," 77). Brewsie, the main GI conversationalist of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, makes this same equation: "Listen, said Brewsie, listen to me. I want to know why do you fellows feel the way you do."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Their listening will necessarily entail their response to him. Conversation is not all voice&#x02014;in fact, radio seems to suggest, talking and listening are inextricable, parts of the same role. Of course, to assign full responsibility for this style of reasoning to the radio would be to diminish the historical importance of a dialogic ethos of response, balance, and discussion, in which no position is static or explicable, but all positions require constant re-exploration. However, it was clear to Stein in the 1940s that radio listenership had had surprisingly positive intellectual effects on the GIs.

<p>
What <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> suggests is that the formal implications of the radio discussion format extend far beyond the implications of its content. The rhetoric of diversity marshaled by the networks in the 1930s and even more ferociously during the war years shows its effects in the particular conversational style that Stein finds at work in the GIs:

The last American army used to ask questions, why do the French people put walls around their houses what are they afraid of what do they want to hide. Why do they want to stay and work this ground when there is so much better land to find. This army does not ask questions like that, they consider that people have their habits and their ways of living, some you can get along with and others you can't, but they are all perfectly reasonable for the people who use them. That is the great change in the Americans, they are interested, they are observant, they are accustomed to various types of people and ways of being, they have plenty of curiosity, but not any criticism, that is the new army. It was all very exciting.

In other words, the point is not simply that the GIs talk, but that they assign a certain performative value to talk. No longer can conversation gain them answers or explain away the peculiarities of a different culture. In this new conversational format, talk continually constitutes and reconstitutes differences; it multiplies ways of being, extending diversity rather than controlling it. This public sphere is not one of consensus but rather one of constant interaction between positions of difference.

<p>
<i>Brewsie and Willie</i> takes the form of a broadcast of this exciting GI talk. The talk's centrality to the text is conveyed through the lack of quotation marks, which indicates Stein's unwillingness to appear to be formally bounding this talk. The novel consists of a series of conversations among American GIs and nurses. Brewsie, a thoughtful GI, and Willie, his more gruff sidekick, are heard in most of the scenes, but not in all of them. The conversations do circle uneasily around a central topic (the nature of a postwar U.S.), but they approach this topic from a myriad of different perspectives and never succeed in resolving anything. If anything, the talk confuses the participants further; as Willie reminds Brewsie, "you just keep on thinking and talking the more foggy you feel" (<i>BW</i>, 719).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  As far as Brewsie is concerned, all of this talking is "how to get going away from what everybody has gotten the habit of thinking is the only way to do, kind of swinging a big truck around, said Jo, and making it come around a corner. No, said Brewsie, not that, but to find the way that looks the same and is different or find the way that looks different and is the same" (<i>BW</i>, 753). Brewsie's conversational agenda is difficult to distinguish from Stein's modernist one. However, the radio-popularized discussion format enables the detachment of this agenda from solitary "genius" res. The end of chapter twelve finds all of the conversation participants suddenly looking around for the missing Brewsie, which suggests their capacity to detach the form from the agent from whom they first learned it.

<p>
The conversations of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> re as moments of community-forming discussion and contemplation, scheduled "Not every day, said Jo./ Mostly every day, said Willie," or with just enough regularity to be dependable without being predictable (<i>BW</i>, 726). Two nurses who discover the sessions in the third chapter return in most subsequent chapters; by the end, they are important contributors to the conversation and have introduced many of their friends to the forum. Like the radio parties that broadcasters were encouraging in the contemporary U.S., these GI conversations powerfully enact the discursive construction of community. And yet they do not require agreement for the construction of community. Indeed, as Brewsie suggests, the 


<b></b>


conversations offer a way out of a dissatisfying community predicated on agreement: "I think we are sad because we have different feelings but we articulate all the same" (<i>BW</i>, 772). The relationships instantiated by the discussion format both arise from and further enable different articulations.

<p>
As the conversations of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> begin again and again, the GIs and nurses together seem to move towards "Not an answer but a way to go on" in a culture of jobs and job-mindedness, consumption and the installment plan (<i>BW</i>, 749). The way to go on, of course, is not to be found in Brewsie's social or economic theories, his evocation of the American pioneer spirit, or any of the other answers he fumbles towards. However, Brewsie's insistence on the possibility of an answer is precisely the energy that keeps the conversations going and keeps the participants interested and interesting. It is not simply the process of discussion that Stein values in this text, but also the na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9; that keeps conversation vital. It is this "innocence" that Stein elsewhere labeled the "new hope" of the WWII generation.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Brewsie's engagement, his creative willingness to produce interpretation and misinterpretation, keeps him and his peers from becoming the kinds of passive consumers that Adorno and the Frankfurt School theorists feared they would be. Much as we may agree with Willie that "there aint any answer," we also see that simply accepting that knowledge would rule out all but passive consumption (<i>BW</i>, 730). The conversational project must be sustained&#x02014;it is a value in and of itself&#x02014;and Willie's knowingness cannot sustain it. 

<p>
Brewsie and Willie's series of conversations ends on the uncertain note of redeployment, in an exchange that suggests the degree to which this radio-mediated conversational ethos has yet to take root in American culture:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
tell me, said Janet, wont you miss talking when you get home, you do know dont you all of you nobody talks like you boys were always talking, not back home. Yes we know, said Jo. Yes we know, said Jimmie. Not Brewsie, said Willie, he'll talk but, said Willie, Brewsie will talk but we wont be there to listen, we kind of will remember that he's talking somewhere but we wont be there to listen, there wont be anybody talking where we will be. But, said Jo, perhaps they will talk now, why you all so sure they wont talk over there, perhaps they will talk over there. Not those on the job they wont, said Willie, not those on the job.

<p class="noIndent">
The body of the text ends on this note of insecurity, Jo's hope for a newly conversational nation met by Willie's gruff disbelief. And yet even the cynic Willie does not entirely abandon the fantasy of a discursively constructed community&#x02014;he simply locates it in the spaces of leisure, away from the job. Not job-mindedness but entertainment will preserve this form and keep Americans talking to each other. Radio did seem optimally positioned to facilitate the new leisure culture, and in leisure Stein finds a space for endangered talk.

<p>
Stein's epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, addressed"To Americans" and written in the first person, takes up the anxieties expressed by the GIs about their return home. According to her, the postwar era is critical to the definition of the nation; if the United States is not to "go poor," it must stop pursuing conventional solutions to its problems 


<b></b>


and devise something truly new. In order to achieve this, according to Stein, "you have to really learn to express complication . . . . Remember the depression, don't be afraid to look it in the face and find out the reason why . . . . Look facts in the face, not just what they all say, the leaders, but every darn one of you" (<i>BW</i>, 778). Stein's epilogue itself enters into a kind of conversation, speaking back to both her text and her readers while remaining formally distinct from both. If <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> adopts the form of the radio, broadcasting conversation, then Stein's epilogue reminds us that listening cannot be passive. The self, even for the participant "outside" the boundaries of the form, must understand herself as implicated and involved in the negotiations of the form.

It is all very well to note Stein speaking from outside the formal boundaries of an established conversation, but we must keep in mind the license granted by her status as a cultural icon in the 1930s and 1940s. Her epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> has the distinct flavor of the Rooseveltian fireside chat. Other res remain more fully outside the formal boundaries of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, the radio, and the nation as imagined community, and their participation helps to construct the limits of the radio-mediated public sphere. Most obvious among these outsider res is the African American. African Americans do not have speaking parts in the conversations that make up <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>; their words, when they appear, are quoted by white participants in the conversations. Although they re repeatedly in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, African American soldiers are noticeably excluded from the expressive form being explored by the text.

<p>
The position of African Americans in both <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> and American wartime radio reinforces the importance of attending to the <i>form</i> of expressive programs. As content, African American culture and questions of race were not considered outside the purview of radio. A large part of radio's success could be attributed to its popular jazz programming throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The first, triumphantly popular, radio serial was <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i>, a blackface comedy that planted race squarely at the center of the topics engaged by radio programming.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  By the 1940s, the American "race problem" had finally begun to re in public debate, by virtue of the wartime equation of racism and nazism.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The conversations of the white GIs and nurses in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> reflect this new turn: they include tales that reflect the inadvertent relaxing of prejudice in the unfamiliarity of wartime surroundings, and tentatively suggest that this relaxation may translate back into the postwar U.S. As content, African Americans re in these forums. 

<p>
Formally, the story is quite different. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>'s resistance to the <i>formal</i> integration of actual black voices (as opposed to white "racial ventriloquism" in the style of <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> or white paternalism in the style of earnest white liberals on many of the discussion shows) follows that of mid-century radio.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Indeed, even on the deliberately provocative <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, black voices were represented


<b></b>


in this period by only three men: Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Walter White of the NAACP (<i>BF</i>, 241). Ironically, African Americans were cast as ill-suited to participation in the discussion of the "racial problem" by virtue of their "bias" on the topic. Here the free and diverse discussion reveals a culturally constructed formal limitation.

<p>
Stein seems quite aware of this formal failure of the radio. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> attempts to critique this limitation by enacting it.In an unusually speechless moment in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, the following scene unfolds: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It was late afternoon and the streets were narrow and three Negro soldiers came along, there was a very little girl and her mother, one of the Negroes fell on his knee like a cavalier before the little girl and took her hand, the mother went on and then stood slightly flushed looking at her little girl, the little girl a little flushed shook the hand of the kneeling soldier, he said a word in French, she answered him, she was a very little girl, only five years old, the other two had gone on, he rose from his knee and he went on, the little girl went along with her mother.

<p class="noIndent">
This interaction is not conveyed via conversation, as is virtually everything else in the text, but by narration. Its incongruity immediately calls attention to the absence of voice&#x02014;we do not hear the African American soldier, any more than the average American heard African American voices on the radio. This compelling re both demands our attention and resists resolution. He particularly seems to resist representing anything other than himself, as if defying the kind of cultural duty that blackness was often compelled to perform in popular entertainment.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  This soldier registers as content; he is not a participant in the form. However, his very inscrutability conveys his resistance to this casting.

<p>
The French that the African American soldier is described as speaking connotes a cosmopolitanism lacking in most of the white GIs. This flexibility extends even beyond the aural. Playful, theatrical, the soldier performs a connection between himself and the young girl, a connection whose eloquence somehow achieves representation in a text otherwise fixated on the representation of voice. Indeed, the scene suggests in several ways that the African American soldier is conversant in multiple languages, employing different forms of voice in order to express himself in a formally limited field. However, in order to suggest this flexibility on the part of the African American GI, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> must deviate from its discussion-dominated format. Suddenly the text seems to express insecurity about the ability of contemporary radio and radio-inspired forms to register other voices and unusual performances of voice.

<p>
This insecurity is well founded. Wartime radio programming ineffectively attempted to balance the need for greater engagement with questions important to African Americans and the fear of broadcasting "inflammatory" material and voices into an increasingly unstable nation. Even before the racial tensions of the war, African American "voice" was insistently cast as musical and theatrical production. During the war, the Armed Forces Radio Service responded to demands for African American representation in radio programming for the troops by transforming <i>Freedom's People</i>, a series 


<b></b>


that discussed the contributions of African Americans to the nation, into <i>Jubilee</i>, a "fine Negro variety show" (<i>RV</i>, 263). Reporting in 1944 on the role of the mass media in the improvement of race relations, L. D. Reddick confirms that "the usual r&#x000F4;le of the Negro in radio is singing spirituals and folk songs and singing and playing jazz music." However, the radio escapes the more scathing indictments that Reddick hands out to other mass mediums; according to him, "the Negro comes nearer to receiving the same treatment 'as everybody else' over the radio than with any of the other agencies of mass communication." Indeed, according to Reddick, African American voices may be more effectively broadcasted through musical programming, which is usually widely disseminated, for discussion programs favorable to the African American are not carried by Southern stations.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein's text does not seem to know what to make of this culturally-imposed limitation of the radio form. On the one hand, jazz programming does not seem equal to the discursive "facing of the facts" that Stein's epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> calls for in the postwar civic conceptualization of the nation. And yet, while the conversation about race was significantly muted after the war victory, African American musical and theatrical voices retained a significant hold on the nation. Scholars of the form have long suggested that jazz and bebop constituted both formal and political programs of resistance for African Americans.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Stein's correspondent Richard Wright seemed to be of that opinion also, explaining to Stein in a letter of 1945 that: "I'm told that one point of solidarity between Negroes and whites in this war was Negro hot music, that when black boys met white boys, they could talk about jazz and swing. It seems like a sort of pass word."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  If network radio sought to evade the "facts" by substituting jazz for African American voices, then, African Americans used jazz to broadcast their own facing&#x02014;and re-shaping&#x02014;of the facts. 

<p>
Stein's radical formalism aligns with the radical formalism of jazz here; her resistance to reading radio as a realistic medium suggests that her words "facing the facts" should not be read as advocating reproduction of the facts. From its outset radio has had the capacity to problematize the idea of "actual black voices." It often did so inadvertently when producers refused to cast African American actors for black roles because they didn't "sound like a Negro."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Walter White made the complexity and contradictions of race in the United States apparent in his day-to-day life and on the radio, but when <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> broadcast on TV, the makeup man "was instructed to darken down White" and "lighten up" one of the other "white" panelists (<i>BF</i>, 238). Radio suggested a realm of vocal performance in which alignment with visually-verifiable (and visually-monitored) "realities" became dangerously slippery. When Langston Hughes participated in "Let's Face the Race Question" on <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> in 1944, correspondence from one viewer suggested that the form of the program in fact complicated the imperative to "face the race": "What percentage of the audience was colored and how many of those who asked questions were colored? We couldn't tell over the air." (<i>BF</i>, 212) Blackface programs like <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> worked to stabilize this point of slippage by instating dialect as a marker of blackness, but res like White, Hughes and Wright undermined this aural regime 


<b></b>


by self-identifying as black while not sounding like either Amos or Andy.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Radio's gift to the mid-century formulation of race was aural confusion.

<p>
In the adamantly visual <i>Life</i> magazine, Stein proudly wrote of her own role in discursively promoting such confusion; she relates a sergeant's complaint that "I confused the minds of his men, but why shouldn't their minds be confused, gracious goodness, are we going to be like the Germans, only believe in the Aryans that is our own race, a mixed race if you like but all having the same point of view."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  In confusion point of view becomes unstable, as does the relation between self and other. Confusion is mixture, slippage, the collapse of boundaries&#x02014;and it is a strategy long employed by Stein's writing.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Confusion of voices and the identities supposedly signified by these voices; of seemingly stable racial positionings, communities and alliances; of divisions between form and content, discussion and performance&#x02014;all of these were enabled by the mass dispersal of the disembodiment staged by the radio. While, on the one hand, the African American soldier seems to represent the limit case for the discursive formation of community, he also subtly implies that radio has the formal capacity to be productively confused about its own limits. 

<p>
Even in its most powerfully networked phase, radio tended formally towards such indeterminacy. After all, what Stein responds to in radio is not its far-reaching capacity as a vehicle for propaganda, but its far-reaching ineptitude at this task. As United States Commissioner of Education J. W. Studebaker wrote in 1939, impermanence is foremost among the "natural limitations of radio . . . radio is an excellent medium for engaging the interest of the public at large; but in order that this attention be translated into lasting results, other activities of a much more far-reaching nature must be sponsored, to take advantage of the widespread interest which radio is able to arouse."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Stein's appreciation of the creative capacities of wandering attention is well known.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The very impermanence of the radio broadcast ensured that the discussions it promoted would soon wander in different directions. As far as Stein was concerned, the shape of the nation and the public spheres constituting it could no more be directed than could the radio talk through which it took form. 

<p>
Talk, as performed by mid-century radio and Stein's mid-century texts, can provide and promote communal confusion; through the performance of this confusion, a flexible and improvisatory community of communities comes into being. In Stein's work of the 1930s and 1940s, radio is employed as a form that enables m&#x000EA;l&#x000E9;es&#x02014;confusions of voices, identities, races, and programs. While reaching a broad audience, it pursues the cacophonous experimentation that characterizes Stein's early writings. In this way, radio formally enacts the modernist constitution of "contested public spheres," forums in which community is in perpetual discursive formation and deformation. Stein's pursuit of this utopian vision of radio marks her as a thinker of her time, to be numbered among the radio boosters, if in an altogether unusual way. It also suggests that she presciently sensed the pertinence of mass media forms to modernist formal experimentation. Radio in particular was a powerful formal model for an intellectual and expressive moment that valued the broadcasting of multiple voices.

By treating radio as a "form" I mean something akin to what Ian Baucom does when he emphasizes Frantz Fanon's request that his readers "conceive of the radio not as an instrument but 'as a technique'"; "Frantz Fanon's Radio: Solidarity, Diaspora, and the Tactics of Listening," <i>Contemporary Literature</i> (Spring, 2001), 25.

Radio's intimacy of address was often considered responsible for its broad public significance. This suturing of intimacy and public efficacy, the personal and the political, is particularly suggestive in the context of important feminist studies of Stein's intimate politics such as those of Marianne DeKoven, Catharine R. Stimpson, and Lisa Ruddick, and more recently, Ellen Berry and Harriet Chessman.

The testimony of another journalist, quoted by Meyer, suggests that the aurality of the experience is constitutive of this brand of understanding:

"To hear Miss Stein read her own work is to understand it&#x02014;I speak for myself&#x02014;for the first time . . . . you see why she writes as she does; you see how from sentence to sentence, which seem so much alike, she introduces differences of tone, or perhaps of accent" . Indeed, the journalist's unreflecting use of the word "see" to convey understanding shows just how much conventional concepts of understanding must be recalibrated in order to admit of Stein's aurality.

Despite her own experiment with a version of blackface in "Melanctha," Stein also deplored certain representations of African American voices: "Dialect in books was upsetting, even then and even now, then when there was no esperanto and now when there is no esperanto" (<i>WIHS</i> 23). Book and radio versions of dialect were comparable in the ways in which they unsuccessfully systematized styles of speech that were essentially protean. Melanctha's speech is profoundly unlike these versions of dialect, and Richard Wright's famous response to the accuracy of Stein's depictions of black speech in "Melanctha" stands as testimony to the efficacy of her non-realistic approach to the representation of voice. Stein's depiction, esperanto-like, crosses boundaries rather than policing them.
