In the wake of Walter Benjamin's critical writings, it has become common to point to the Paris of the mid nineteenth century as the historical matrix of modernity. According to this conception, it was Paris that first gave rise to a radically new kind of sensibility and urban experience that was to find its characteristic expression in modernist art and literature.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Despite frequent references to this phenomenon, however, it has proven to be difficult to conceptualize and almost impossible to reconcile with contemporary social or aesthetic theories.  Occasionally juxtaposed to the abstract philosophic inheritance of the Enlightenment, the modernity of the urban experience has remained an amorphous and anomalous category, which can only be envisioned as the "other" of more familiar social and political conceptualizations of the modern. It represented, as Scott Lash and Jonathan Friedman put it, <i>another</i> modernity, "not of Rousseau's Geneva of natural rights and <i>volont&#x000E9; g&#x000E9;n&#x000E9;rale, </i>but instead of Baudelaire's Paris of the fleeting, the transient."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How can we capture this important yet elusive cultural phenomenon? Is there a body of literary or philosophic theory that can provide a positive, rather than a merely negative, depiction of its characteristic gestures and goals? Despite superficial resemblances, Benjamin's vision of modernity was not synonymous with what Lionel Trilling had labeled the adversary culture. It rejected, in other words, the familiar dualism of both modernist and romantic theorists, who postulated a diametrical opposition 

<b></b>

between an interiorized realm of wholeness and integrity, on the one hand; and the external world of institutions and production, on the other. The modernity toward which Benjamin gestured was a single field of fluid perception and experience, rather than the repository of non-utilitarian values and perceptions marginalized by conventional society. It was the site of radical freedom and indeterminacy, where art and thought no longer reflected the pre-existent harmony of the universe, but helped create the preconditions for morality, beauty and intelligibility.  Above all, it was a radical and transgressive realm, which posed a powerful challenge to all stable or foundational categories associated with social and political modernity.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental incompatibility between the two modernities was already apparent to Baudelaire in the middle of the nineteenth century. In his Salon of 1859, he strikingly characterized it as a mortal combat between two ambitious men, "who hate one another with an intrinsic hatred, and when they meet upon the same road, one of them has to give way."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Although Baudelaire referred to this allegorical battle as the conflict between Poetry and Progress, the stakes were much higher than aesthetics. Indeed, one of my main arguments in this essay will be the need to liberate the concept of modernity from its vague associations with aestheticism and to reconnect it with the philosophic tradition of existentialism, phenomenology, and, ultimately, of everyday life. This task will involve a certain degree of defamiliarization and a shift away from an exclusive association of modernity with the cultural landscape of nineteenth-century Paris. I hope to show that Baudelaire's cultural vision, which first suggested this association, was the prototype of a more abstract theoretical and philosophic discourse about the novel and popular culture that was carried out in the twentieth century by critical thinkers such as the young Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Ren&#x000E9; Girard and others.

Undoubtedly, modernity as a cultural idea found its earliest, and still paradigmatic, definition in Baudelaire's much-quoted essay of 1860, "The Painter of Modern Life" and it still provides a useful entry into our discussion. "By 'modernity'," Baudelaire famously wrote, "I mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Baudelaire's use of quotation marks around the concept of modernity signals the provisional and uncertain status of this idea for his time. Significantly, it was not synonymous with the familiar notion of modern times (<i>les temps modernes), </i>which had been in circulation since the seventeenth century and referred to a historical period that followed the Middle Ages.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Modernity as used by Baudelaire implied not so much a specific historical time, as an unprecedented experience of change and disruption that was characterized by the loss of stable external references for individual perception.
</p>

<p>
It is important to emphasize that Baudelaire's vision of the modern was not unique to his own avant-garde project.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  It was based on popular literary and cultural discourses of the 1840s, which linked the novel experiences of the age with the rise of the city 

<b></b>

and the erosion of transparency in contemporary life. Novelists such as Eug&#x000E8;ne Sue, Victor Hugo, and Alexander Dumas gave popular expression to this idea in their urban fictions, which depicted the city of Paris as a maze or labyrinth that could no longer provide coherent patterns or a logical design for the observer. Life seemed to have become illegible under modern conditions, which no longer provided the markers of public identity still available in traditional society. As Balzac tellingly put it, under the old regime, "one could tell who people were from their outward appearance and demeanor, even from their clothes." Contemporary life, by contrast, seemed to have produced a world of "infinite nuances," where identity was no longer publicly available.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The concept of modernity was, thus, inextricably intertwined with a crisis of representation or visuality, which affected all thoughtful observers, but was of most immediate concern to artists and writers charged with depicting the contours and distinct characteristics of modern life. The question at the heart of Baudelaire's project was how to imagine, conceptualize, and represent a world that had lost the legibility of traditional social orders. Were transparence and coherence possible in contemporary civilization and if not, how could it, nevertheless, be represented as a coherent whole? Significantly, these questions involved more than an aesthetic problem. They also encompassed ontological and epistemological questions that had traditionally been the concern of social theorists and philosophers, rather than artists.
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire explored the wide-ranging implications of this cultural crisis through the formulaic re of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> res [<a href="#1">1</a> &amp; <a href="#2">2</a>]. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> has frequently been presented in later commentaries as an idle stroller or as the passive consumer of the urban spectacle. But, as Baudelaire's text makes clear, he was also a meticulous observer and recorder of experience in the city.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Indeed, his devotion to "the sketch of manners, the depiction of bourgeois life and the pageant of fashion"<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  made him the prototype of the modern novelist who focused on the everyday, as opposed to the elevated, facets of life. In his different guises as popular journalist, urban reporter, caricaturist, and story teller, he transformed the fleeting and trivial impressions of the urban scene into images and narratives that expressed the essential qualities of modernity. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was, as Baudelaire insisted, the true hero of modern life, because he had the ability to make visible and legible the elusive landscape of modernity that had become invisible and illegible under ordinary conditions.
</p>

<p>
By linking the question of modernity with the production of urban texts, Baudelaire suggested for the first time that modernity was inconceivable without its representations and that modern culture was not a reflection of reality, but rather, a creative force in its own right that played a central role in mediating between experience and society. Significantly, these ideas did not find broad-based support at the time of their writing, nor did they have any serious resonance immediately after Baudelaire's death in 1867. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, doubts about the possibility of representing the modern were resolved through the aesthetic codes of Realism, which subordinated art and perception to the stable and objective formulae of the natural sciences. It was not until the first half of the twentieth century, with the crisis of Realism, that Baudelaire's complex meditations about modernity as a cultural problem 

<b></b>

became relevant again. They were taken up by a group of philosophically oriented literary theorists such as Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, Jos&#x000E9; Ortega y Gasset, Mikhail Bakhtin, Ren&#x000E9; Girard, Lucien Goldmann, Milan Kundera and others, whose theoretical inquiries into the cultural problems of the novel continued and deepened Baudelaire's earlier observations on modernity. In their hands, the related problems of urban modernity and representation were to be reformulated as the condition of possibility behind the creation of the world of the novel. </p>

<p>
The affinities between Baudelaire's urban vision and twentieth-century theories of the novel are not immediately obvious and have rarely been commented on, much less analyzed. One of the reasons for this neglect may lie in the fragmentation of critical discourses about modernity in the late nineteenth century and the shift of the center of gravity of such discussions from Paris to Central Europe. It was to be in the context of German neo-Kantian philosophy, exemplified by thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Wilhelm Dilthey, that the cultural implications of modernity and the nineteenth-century city were to be further developed and theorized. It is to this tradition that theorists of the novel would turn to ground their own vision of twentieth-century modernity. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Dilthey, in particular, was instrumental in drawing attention to the practices of urban novelists such as Dickens and Balzac as a possible source of a new theory of aesthetic modernity. In a seminal essay of 1887, he pointed out that there had developed a growing disjunction between speculative aesthetics inherited from the eighteenth century and contemporary artistic sensibilities as experienced by ordinary people. "Our German aesthetics does indeed still survive in some universities," Dilthey wrote, "but no longer in the consciousness of the leading artists and critics where it should live above all&#x02026;Since the French Revolution a new poetry current in London and Paris has attracted the interest of poets and public alike. As soon as Dickens and Balzac began to write the epic of modern life as found in the cities, the basic poetic principles debated by Schiller, Goethe, and Humboldt in idyllic Weimar became irrelevant."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Dilthey did not work out the full implications of these ideas and perhaps for this reason his essay never gained the widespread recognition it deserves. His theoretical agenda calling for a rediscovery of the nineteenth-century novel was to be continued, however, by his disciple, Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, whose lifelong engagement with the philosophic problems of the novel can be traced back directly to Dilthey. As Luk&#x000E1;cs later admitted, his early masterpiece <i>The Theory of the Novel</i>  was conceived in the intellectual orbit of Dilthey and other neo-Kantian thinkers and was regarded in the 1920s as "a typical product of the tendencies of that school" as well as "the movement's most important publication."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In fact, Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay on the novel was a further development of Dilthey's 1887 article, which, according to his own confession, opened up new grounds for his thinking about aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Theory of the Novel</i> was a prolonged meditation on the experiential world of the novel, written from the perspective of a modern sensibility no longer anchored within the foundational truths of art, science, or religion. The essay's powerful depiction of a destabilized and fragmented modernity gave voice to a cultural landscape that Baudelaire had already mapped out in the middle of the nineteenth century. Significantly, however, Luk&#x000E1;cs' reconceptualization no longer associated this state specifically with Paris, or even with a clearly defined chronological period. Detached from any particular geographic space or historical time, the world of the novel became a timeless archetype of the modern condition as it existed in the disembodied the consciousness of the individual.
</p>

<p>
In later life, the Marxist Luk&#x000E1;cs distanced himself from this essay, considering it an ideological deviation from the true path of socialism. <i>The Theory of the Novel</i>, Luk&#x000E1;cs explained, juxtaposed a radicalized, critical consciousness with a conservative acceptance of the everyday realities of capitalism, thus presenting a paradoxical "fusion of 'left' ethics and 'right' epistemology."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Whatever one might think of the political critique, the assessment itself was valid and went to the heart of the cultural experience captured in the essay. For the universe of the novel as interpreted by the young Luk&#x000E1;cs was indeed counter-political and difficult to define in traditional ideological terms. Like Baudelaire's complex assessment of modernity, it also gave voice to an intensely critical attitude toward modernity along with an equally intense immersion in, and preoccupation with, its experiential realities. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
What gives extraordinary interest to this perspective is the fact that it was prototypical of a more general inquiry into the phenomenology of the novel that emerged independently of Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay and was to constitute a submerged literary-philosophic tradition of its own in the twentieth century. In the summer of 1914, almost at the same moment when Luk&#x000E1;cs conceived his essay, the Spanish philosopher Jos&#x000E9; Ortega y Gasset published his own version of the historical meaning of the novel, with the suggestive title, <i>Meditations on Quixote</i>. More important and more lasting were the critical writings of the Russian literary scholar, Mikhail Bakhtin, who remained preoccupied with the historical and theoretical implications of the novel throughout the 1920s and '30s. In the 1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in the philosophy of the novel with the publication of Lucien Goldmann's <i>Toward the Sociology of the Novel</i> and Ren&#x000E9; Girard's <i>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i>. Goldmann was directly indebted to Luk&#x000E1;cs, while Girard, as he later confessed to Goldmann, had not read Luk&#x000E1;cs but unconsciously "discovered the Luk&#x000E1;csian analyses, while modifying them on several important points."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In the 1980s, writers such Milan Kundera and Franco Moretti returned once again to the genre of philosophic speculation about the novel, exploring its implications for late twentieth century culture in <i>The Art of the Novel</i> and <i>Modern Epic</i> respectively.
</p>

<p>
Michael McKeon has categorized these dispersed critical works as "grand theories" in order to distinguish them from more focused literary studies of the novelistic genre.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Though a sharp line of demarcation between the two traditions is not always easy to draw, the general distinction is, nevertheless, an important one. Unlike literary scholars such as Ian Watt, George Levine, Joseph Frank, or Michael McKeon himself, theorists of the novel loosely associated with the young Luk&#x000E1;cs were only peripherally interested in the formal or generic qualities of the novel.  Transcending the disciplinary boundaries of literary criticism, their real focus was the cultural-philosophic phenomenon of modernity, as it found expression through novelistic representation. Nancy Glazer's characterization of Bakhtin's work on the novel is applicable to the entire tradition that is under discussion here. "Viewed in conjunction," she wrote, "Bakhtin's discussion of Rabelais and Dostoevsky amount to neither an empirical account of the novel's history and form, nor a manifesto about what the novel should become. Rather, Bakhtin uncovers the ideological range of the novel genre we have inherited as a function of its past, and its history might best be understood as the accumulation of a repertory rather than as a linear development."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The theorists of the novel themselves confirmed this interpretation, repeatedly stressing the need to see the novel not merely as a literary genre but also as a microcosm of modernity. There existed, Lucien Goldmann wrote, a homology between "the structure of the classic novel and the structure of exchange in the liberal economy."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The novel was, Luk&#x000E1;cs echoed, "the representative art-form of our age: because the structural categories of the novel constitutively coincide with the world as it is today."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The lack of canonicity or formal qualities characteristic of the novel, Bakhtin further elaborated, was directly related to the dynamic, unfinished character of the social experience that it reflected. Indeed, the novel was   

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the only developing genre and therefore it reflects more deeply, more essentially, more sensitively and rapidly, reality itself in the process of unfolding. Only that which is itself developing can comprehend development as a process. The novel has become the leading hero in the drama of literary development in our time precisely because it best of all reflects the tendencies of a new world still in the making; it is, after all, the only genre born of this new world and in total affinity with it.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite the frequency of such claims, theorists of the novel have rarely been read as philosophers or theorists of modernity. There are at least two reasons for this surprising fact. The first has to do with the marked reluctance of these thinkers to extricate the cultural or philosophic implications of their analysis from its literary manifestations. They acted on the implicit assumption that modernity was inseparable from its textual representations and could not be discussed in the abstract. The second and perhaps more important reason for the absence of theorists of the novel from general discussions of modernity has to do with the heterogeneity of the group. They never constituted a unified philosophic or literary movement, whose arguments could readily be summarized in terms of a common ideology or theoretical position. Indeed, they manifested a wide range of often contradictory attitudes toward the meanings and implications of the modern experience as reflected in the novel.
</p>

<p>
Ortega celebrated this world, regarding it as the expression of heterogeneity and a means of liberation from the "monotonous conformity of the epic."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Bakhtin, too, had an essentially positive view of the novel, which, according to him, challenged political patriarchy, ossified literary forms, and the "unfreedom of the subject."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  For Luk&#x000E1;cs, on the other hand, the universe of the novel signified an essentially tragic condition marked by the "transcendental homelessness" of the modern self, who had lost the possibility of experiencing totality, meaning, and redemption. It was, as he strikingly put it "the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Girard's vision of the novelistic universe was equally anguished, though for somewhat different reasons. In his case the source of critique was not the absence of totality but of spiritual transcendence in the modern world where desire, envy, and <i>ressentiment</i> were always inevitably intertwined.
</p>

<p>
Despite such sharply differentiated opinions about the implications of modernity, theorists of the novel nevertheless conceived the cultural topography of the novel in roughly similar terms. Moreover, they used almost identical categories to depict its contours. Just as Baudelaire had juxtaposed the flux and contingency of modernity to the realm of the eternal and the immutable, so theorists of the novel conceptualized the phenomenology of the modern in terms as an unceasing opposition between the world of the novel and the epic. These were, as we have already noted, not simply different literary genres but different orders of experience that were radically incommensurate with each other. The epic did not constitute the historical antecedent of the novel, but rather its absolute other, whose existential realities could not even be imagined by the modern self. As Luk&#x000E1;cs put it, the world of the epic had become uninhabitable to the modern mind, which had outgrown the finitude of a closed universe.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Bakhtin repeated the same perception when he claimed that the epic "stands on an utterly different and inaccessible time-and-value plane" from the modern novel.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  There was, Ortega 

<b></b>

elaborated on the same idea, an absolute gap between the mythical world of the epic and the real world of the novel. "No matter how many real yesterdays we interrogate, the sphere inhabited by the Achilleses and the Agamemnons has no relationship with our existence and we cannot reach it, step by step, by retracing the path opened up by the march of time. The epic is not our past."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The emphatic rejection of all conceptual or chronological continuities between the novel and the epic had more radical consequences than may be apparent at first sight. It went far beyond the familiar notions of discontinuity or even cataclysmic disruption, which have become staples of critical discourses about the modern world. The radical incommensurability between the world of the epic and the novel ultimately negated the very idea of history itself, which could no longer be conceived as teleological process, cultural regression, or linear evolution. The world of the novel, its theorists insisted, gave rise to a new consciousness of time that was experienced for the first time as ceaseless movement and becoming, rather than as divinely orchestrated pattern or as rationally organized progress. For the modern mind, Bakhtin explained, "the present is something transitory, it is flow, it is eternal continuation without end; it is denied an authentic conclusiveness and consequently lacks essence as well."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Detached from all chronological or conceptual relations to the past or the future, the world of the novel was a timeless condition that could emerge unexpectedly at different historical moments. It is for this reason that Bakhtin could claim that novelistic periods "occurred several times in the Hellenic period, again in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but with special force and clarity beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

What were the characteristic features of this novelistic universe that was beyond the conceptual categories of history? More specifically still, what were the continuities and divergences between this decontextualized world and Baudelaire's own vision of urban modernity? In considering these questions, I will focus on the formulations of Luk&#x000E1;cs, Bakhtin, and Girard, possibly the most nuanced theoretician of the novel, whose ideas complemented each other to a remarkable extent. Their meditations about the novel lead them through a heterogeneous intellectual terrain that ranged, in apparent disregard of disciplinary boundaries, through cultural criticism, epistemology, aesthetics, literary theory, and sociology. These issues, however, were invariably framed by a common set of concerns whose source can clearly be traced back to visions of the nineteenth-century city as first interpreted by Baudelaire. They, too, were preoccupied by the crisis of representation and experience under modern conditions, whose pre-eminent symbol had been the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>. It is thus hardly surprising that this formulaic re of nineteenth-century modernity should find re-incarnation in their work as a new kind of hero associated with the world of the novel. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The demise of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and his metamorphosis into the hero of the novel is a complicated story that cannot be fully recounted here. Susan Buck-Morss succinctly summarized it when she remarked that the original <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> who inhabited the Parisian arcades of the 1840s has been irretrievably lost to the twentieth century, having exploded into a "myriad of forms" which constitute only brilliant traces of its earlier existence.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Significantly, the process of diffusion and fragmentation was already well under way by the time Baudelaire adopted the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as the quintessential symbol of the modern artist. The transformation of Paris into a rationalized and impersonal public space in the course of the 1850s and 1860s was gradually destroying the physical and cultural preconditions of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>. Haussmann's Paris erased not only the old neighborhoods that had been the characteristic haunts of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> but also the dense networks of urban sociability that had formed the social and cultural basis of his enterprise.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> could no longer hope to render this new city legible and comprehensible to its inhabitants and he gradually faded from the cultural scene of the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Although the urban context almost completely disappeared from twentieth-century depictions of the novelistic hero, the family likeness with the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> remained in evidence and pointed to a common cultural enterprise. Like his nineteenth-century predecessor, the hero of the novel was also a cultural type, rather than a particular individual, who embodied the general characteristics of the modern condition. He, too, was a textual creation as well as a creator of texts, and thus constituted a symbolic bridge between the realms of social experience and aesthetic representation. Significantly, however, the world of social experience and aesthetic representation had become both more fragmented and more radical in the twentieth century and the hero of the novel invariably developed different strategies for representing them. While the nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> had still been able to hold in precarious balance the different aspects of modernity, the hero of the novel could no longer aspire to such a broadly synthetic function. He assumed different features and characteristics in the respective theories of Luk&#x000E1;cs, Bakhtin, and Girard, whose amplifications of particular facets of nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> provided new incarnations of modern identity and, more generally, of the modern condition. Curiously, these amplifications ultimately served to clarify and radicalize, rather than invalidate, the condensed vision of modernity provided in Baudelaire's paradigmatic <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>.
</p>

<p>
The continuities between the hero of the novel and the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> are, perhaps, most readily recognizable in Luk&#x000E1;cs' novelistic hero, whose transcendental homelessness reenacted the nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>'s problematic, essentially promiscuous, relationship to the physical spaces of the modern city. Both res were estranged from the external world, where identity could no longer be defined through physical deeds or heroic adventure. The development of an "autonomous life of interiority," Luk&#x000E1;cs emphasized, was the inevitable consequence of the modern experience. Yet, alienation and interiorization were not absolute conditions for the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and the novelistic hero. Both remained haunted by visions of totality associated with the epic and both defined their identities through the frame of epic possibilities. Describing the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> 

<b></b>

as an "out-of-work Hercules,"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Baudelaire only hinted obliquely at this lost horizon of modern identity. By contrast, Luk&#x000E1;cs fully explored it, defining the novelistic hero as the direct antithesis of the epic hero.
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs did not present the lost world of the epic as a utopia that provided security or an absence of suffering for its heroes. The defining feature of this lost world was, as Luk&#x000E1;cs put it, "the adequacy of the deeds to the soul's inner demand for greatness, for unfolding, for wholeness."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The epic hero was at home in the world because of a fundamental homology between itself and the possibilities offered by external reality. There was no fundamental distinction between "inside" and "outside" in the epic universe since the self and the world were made of the same substance. "The world is wide and yet it is like home," Luk&#x000E1;cs illustrated, "for the fire that burns in the soul is of the same essential nature as the stars; the world and the self, the light and the fire, are sharply distinct, yet never become permanent strangers to one another."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  By contrast, the hero of the novel lived in a world "richer in gifts and dangers than the world of the Greeks," but the meaning of this world had become unknowable to him, because it was alien to his inner essence. The disappearance of overarching symbolic meanings rooted in the experience of totality had made the external world fundamentally unknowable to the modern mind.
</p>

<p>
It is important to stress that Luk&#x000E1;cs' juxtaposition of the world of the epic to that of the novel had nothing to do with nostalgia for an unattainable past. His was not a conservative repudiation of the decadence of modern life, but rather a radical critique of one particular version of modernity to which Baudelaire had already referred in 1859 as the idea of Progress. In Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay, however, Progress assumed a more specific, less allegorical, incarnation than in Baudelaire. It was represented by Kant's pivotal re and in particular by the epistemological assumptions of modern rationality as codified by Kant's critical philosophy. Significantly, Luk&#x000E1;cs' epistemological critique of rationality evoked the same images that Baudelaire and his contemporaries had used in their own depictions of the crisis of urban representation in the mid nineteenth-century city. For Luk&#x000E1;cs, too, the essential problem of rational epistemology was associated with the failure of vision and the decrease of transparency in everyday life. As he put it, the hero of the novel could no longer understand the external meaning of events, nor penetrate "Kant's starry firmament" since he had lost all inner relationship to the external world.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Knowledge became internalized, subjective, self-reflexive, and the knowing self no more than a groping wanderer in the night of pure cognition. For such a self, Luk&#x000E1;cs concluded, "no light radiates any longer from within into the world of events, into its vast complexity to which the soul is a stranger."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs' perception that Kantian rationalism had become incompatible with modern experience was widely shared by theorists of the novel and formed, indeed, the defining category of their particular vision of modernity. Bakhtin's infinitely more optimistic interpretation of the world of the novel also repudiated autonomous reason as a basis for modern identity and knowledge. This is made all the more striking by the fact that his particular critique of modern rationality took an entirely different form than Luk&#x000E1;cs'. Bakhtin saw the novelistic hero, not as a tragic and disembodied consciousness adrift 

<b></b>

in an unknowable world; but rather as comic performer and a creator of masks and disguises rooted in face-to-face relations. These seemingly incompatible versions of the novelistic hero were actually mirror images of each other, representing different facets of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>. For as Baudelaire had made clear, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was not only an urban stroller and observer but also a theatrical performer who assumed masks and disguises&#x02014;that of the child, the primitive, the dandy, the courtesan, and the soldier&#x02014;in order to reenact the lost totality of epic culture in the midst of a fragmented modern civilization.
</p>

<p>
The aesthetic process shaping the creation of this kind of self was, Bakhtin suggests, similar to the construction of comic genres in antiquity. The masks of antiquity "had&#x02026;an enormous influence on the development of the novelistic image of man. This structure is preserved even in the novel, although in a more complex, deeply meaningful and serious (or serio-comical) form."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The affinity between the hero of the novel and the comic masks of antiquity and the middle ages was their parodic and transgressive relationship to the epic heroes of high genres, whom they brought down to everyday life. Bakhtin's unique vision of modern identity reversed Luk&#x000E1;cs' tragic categories, insisting that the masks of the novelistic hero represented not alienation and inauthenticity, but rather, "a happy surplus" and the inexhaustibility of human possibilities. "There is," Bakhtin elaborated, "no mere form that would be able to incarnate once and forever all of his human possibilities and needs, no form in which he could exhaust himself down to the last word, like the tragic epic hero&#x02026;.There always remains an unrealized surplus of humaneness; there always remains a need for the future, and a place for this future must be found. All existing clothes are always too tight, thus comical, on a man."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The contrast between the epic hero and the hero of the novel was inevitably favorable to the latter. While the epic self was trapped in one identity and defined by the force of an external fate, the hero of the modern self was free to define himself and to transcend his given circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Bakhtin's novelistic hero repudiated not only the closed world of the epic but also all "high genres," including critical philosophy. In place of formalized knowledge and official ideology, the modern self affirmed "the eternally living element of unofficial language and unofficial thought (holiday form, familiar speech, profanation)."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Knowledge in the world of the novel was everyday, realistic, based on the common world of ordinary people, and hostile to all existing hierarchies and established authority. It had, Bakhtin explained, "the remarkable power to make an object come up close, of drawing it into a zone of crude contact where one can finger it familiarly on all sides, turn it upside down, inside out, peer at it from above and below, break open its external shell, look into its center, doubt it, take it apart, dismember it, lay it bare and expose it, examine it freely and experiment with it."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The critique of philosophic rationalism, explicit in both Luk&#x000E1;cs and Bakhtin, was continued in the literary criticism of Ren&#x000E9; Girard, who conceptualized the hero of the novel as a desiring, rather than as a knowing or performing, self. A creature of will, imagination, and fantasy, Girard's novelistic hero embodied perhaps the least familiar facet of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>, that of consumption. Yet, the experience of consumption was an integral part of Baudelaire's vision of the modern city, whose sights and attractions were not only 

<b></b>

observed, but also consumed by the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>.  In the final analysis, Baudelaire's <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was not only a fictional character within novels nor an actual producer of novels; he was also an avid consumer of novels. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as consumer was neither a tragic nor a transgressive re but a nostalgic one who refused to relinquish the world of epic adventure and attempted to recreate its possibilities through imagination and imitation. For Girard, the prototype of this type of self was Don Quixote, who was also the first example of the novelistic hero. Anticipating later incarnation of the type such as Mme Bovary, Don Quixote was a passionate reader of contemporary romances and set himself the task of duplicating the world of chivalric ideals exemplified by the fictional hero Amadis.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Don Quixote, wrote Girard, "has surrendered to Amadis the individual's fundamental prerogative: he no longer chooses the objects of his own desire&#x02014;Amadis must choose for him. The disciple pursues objects which are determined for him, or at least seem to be determined for him, by the model of chivalry."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What was taken for knowledge in the modern world, Girard pointed out, was the imitative impulse and the desire to identify with an admired other. Significantly, desire was never direct between the desiring subject and the desired object, but triangular, involving a third, unacknowledged other, who mediated between the subject and the object. The triangular nature of desire could turn into hatred and <i>ressentiment</i> in modern conditions. While Don Quixote had still acknowledged the object of his emulation as superior to himself, in the world of the nineteenth-century novel, the imitative impulse could not be openly acknowledged since it was projected on to individuals who were essentially one's equals. Knowledge as the imitation of the desire of the other, Girard postulated, had nothing in common with the "objective and subjective fallacies" of traditional epistemology, which insisted on locating truth either in the inner or the outer worlds. Cognition based on desire was always socially embedded in the sense that it took place in the world between subjects rather than within them or outside them. What made this fact difficult to recognize was the ideology of originality, objectivity, and autonomy that had developed in the late eighteenth century. Modern theories of knowledge, whether associated with the Enlightenment or Romanticism, Girard summarized, "all defend the same illusion of autonomy to which modern man is passionately devoted."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
The remarkable convergences among these different conceptualizations of the novelistic hero are no coincidence. Whether conceived as Luk&#x000E1;cs' tragic observer, as Bakhtin's comic performer, or as Girard's imitative consumer, the novelistic hero represented different facets and incarnations of nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>, transposed beyond the empirical spaces of the city. Yet, the exact nature of this common historical context still needs to be established. How can we characterize the symbolic world inhabited by the heroes of the novel? Their opposition to the abstract world of Kantian reason and their valorization of the experiential realm of everyday life point to affinities with the philosophic traditions of existentialism and phenomenology. It is significant 

<b></b>

that the Marxist Luk&#x000E1;cs used identical terms to characterize his own youthful essay on the novel and Sartre's philosophy of existentialism; he referred to both as examples of a mistaken ideology, combining "left" ethics and "right" epistemology.
</p>

<p>
Yet, the analysis of the world of the novel exclusively in terms of existentialism or phenomenology can go only so far and provides only partial insight into its realities. On closer examination, there were striking divergences between the two phenomena. Unlike existentialism, the novel was not analogous with a meaningless or atomized universe, inhabited by isolated individuals. On the contrary, it gave expression to a complex cultural system with a unity of its own that incorporated the fragmented elements of modern life within a new, paradoxical vision of totality. By the same token, the hero of the novel was not the isolated subject of existentialist philosophers but a culturally embedded self, whose very identity was defined by webs of social relations mediated through irony, parody, and desire. This was true of even Luk&#x000E1;cs' novelistic hero, whose cosmic pessimism had distinct resonances with existentialist themes. Luk&#x000E1;cs' exemplary modern self, however, was ultimately an affirmative re, who assumed the mantle of epic heroes in his attempts to make sense of the world in which he lived. His habitual state of mind was irony, not anguish. Like Baudelaire's Monsieur G., Luk&#x000E1;cs' hero was not a metaphysical outsider but a man of the world, whose maturity was based on hard-won sociological insights.
</p>

<p>
In the final analysis, it is the profoundly social aspects of the novelistic universe that projected it beyond the philosophic frames of existentialism. In order to understand the nature of this sociability, it will be useful to look a little more closely at the aesthetic dimensions of theories of the novel, which provided the preconditions for its distinctive vision of modernity. Contrary to the assumptions of na&#x000EF;ve realists, theorists of the novel did not hold that the world of everyday experience reflected in the novel could ever be represented directly or without mediation. As Luk&#x000E1;cs pointed out, everyday life was meaningless and ungraspable without aesthetic structuring. In his words, everyday modernity cannot achieve the
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
form of totality for itself as a whole, or any form of coherence for its own relationship to its elements and their relationship to one another: in other words, the outside world cannot be represented. Both the parts and the whole of such an outside world defy any forms of direct sensuous representation. They acquire life only when they can be related either to the life-experiencing interiority of the individual lost in their labyrinth, or to the observing and creative eye of the artist's subjectivity: when they become objects of mood and reflection.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim, however, that aesthetics lay at the heart of representing modern experience brought with it theoretical contradictions of which theorists of the novel were well aware. For even while asserting that the world of the novel could not exist without aesthetic structuring, they also paradoxically maintained that the novelistic form was incompatible with canonical aesthetics. The novel, they insisted, had shattered all inherited aesthetic forms and equally rejected the conventions of classicism and Romanticism. It differed from these traditions precisely because of its openness to the 

<b></b>

disruptive energies of everyday life and ordinary experiences.  It was a fundamentally heterogeneous genre that did not make strict distinctions between the fictional and the real, between art and life. "That is why," Luk&#x000E1;cs wrote, "from the artistic view point, the novel is the most hazardous genre, and why it has been described as only half an art by many who equate <i>having a problematic </i>with <i>being a problematic.</i>"<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  It was perhaps Bakhtin who made most explicit the connection between the novel and the transgressive energies of everyday culture. Novelization, he wrote, exploded aesthetic forms, incorporating extra-literary elements into language, and thus creating "a living contact with unfinished, still evolving contemporary reality."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>   Comic genres, of which the novel was a direct descendant, made no pretense of originality but openly challenged closed and elite literary forms. For this reason, they had the power to both transform the world and to see it realistically.
</p>

<p>
Although the novel's open-ended and heterogeneous structure represented the direct antithesis of classicism, its true adversary, as far as theorists of the novel were concerned, was not the epic but Romanticism, in which they saw the precursor of all forms of modern high art. Romanticism, they objected, attempted to artificially reaffirm the organic unity in the work of art in an age when such experiences were no longer available to the modern mind. Luk&#x000E1;cs presented perhaps the most passionate critique of Romanticism and the Kantian theory of aesthetic autonomy and disinterestedness. He argued that this kind of art was essentially escapist, substituting an illusion of wholeness for the fragmented realities of modern experience. The attempt to resurrect through art a totality that was no longer part of the genuine experience of the modern self was, he claimed, a demonic act of hubris, "a violence done to the essence of everything that lies outside the sphere of art." All theories of aesthetic autonomy were, he objected, deliberate attempts to "forget that art is only one sphere among many, and that the very disintegration and inadequacy of the world is a precondition of the existence of art and its becoming conscious."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The true expression of a fragmented modernity, Luk&#x000E1;cs insisted, was not the illusory and escapist totality advocated by the Kantian aesthetic of autonomy but the willed heterodoxy of the modern novel that was the only form capable of creating the true epic of modern life.
</p>

<p>
The challenge of theorizing the novel as an art form lay precisely in explaining the paradox of its aesthetic unity in the midst of its heterodoxy. How did the novel remain open to the dynamic elements of modern life without disintegrating into its constituent parts or into autonomous, self-sufficient fields?  For theorists of the novel, the answer lay in the novel's paradoxical relationship to the epic, which continued to frame the novelistic universe as its condition of negative possibility. The epic possibilities inherent in the modern condition had preoccupied Baudelaire as well, who encouraged his contemporaries to discover the essential "heroism of modern life" in the diverse manifestations of urban popular culture. By the twentieth century, theorists of the novel articulated the same quest in a more ironic but equally urgent form. As Luk&#x000E1;cs tellingly put it, "the novel is the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given, in which the immanence of life has become a problem, yet which still thinks in terms of totality."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The novelistic perspective was, thus, defined by an "intuitive double vision" that continued to see the modern world through the lost image of the epic. Ironic echoing, parody, and imitation had the paradoxical power to affirm the heterogeneity of the novelistic universe even while linking its dissonant parts in a provisional unity. The organicism implied in such a world, Luk&#x000E1;cs explained, was not "a true-born organic relationship but a conceptual one which is abolished again and again."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The ironic point of view was based on the recognition "that meaning can never quite penetrate reality, but that, without meaning, reality would disintegrate into the nothingness of inessentiality."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>   It was ultimately the vision of a hard-won maturity that, to use Luk&#x000E1;cs' words again, "can see where God is to be found in a world abandoned by God" and can recognize "the lost utopian home of the idea that has become an ideal."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Whether perceived as tragedy or as comedy, the novel constituted a paradoxical unity that echoed, without duplicating, the totality of the epic.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible not to recognize in these aesthetic formulations the constitutive elements of a theory of popular culture, which posed its radical claims in opposition to the formal unity of high art. Such an identification is not surprising if we keep in mind that the novel was one of the pioneering forms of an explicitly commercialized popular culture, which came into existence in the course of the early nineteenth century in metropolitan centers such as Paris and London. As Marthe Robert usefully reminds us, the novel was "a newcomer to the literary scene, a commoner made good who will always stand out as something of an upstart, even a bit of a swindler, among the established genres it is supplanting."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of recognizing the familiar features of popular commercial culture within the sophisticated formulations of theorists of the novel can in part be explained by the problematic, degraded status of commercialized culture within critical discourses about the modern. Since its first appearance in the Paris of the 1830s, the phenomenon has drawn the passionate criticism of middle-class intellectuals and social elites. In 1839, the critic Sainte-Beuve declared a moral crusade against what he called "La litt&#x000E9;rature industrielle" (The Industrial Literature), condemning it as a trivialized form of entertainment that threatened both artistic excellence and moral standards in the modern world.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Such criticism, which would be reiterated in many different forms and contexts, invariably resorted to an apocalyptic vocabulary of decadence and cultural decline and often posed its fears in terms of elite culture's distrust of popular democracy. The exaggeration of language and rhetoric was, however, based on an accurate intuition. Popular commercial culture did, indeed, prove to be incompatible with what Baudelaire had labeled in his Salon of 1859 the re of Progress. It questioned the absolute autonomy of the individual, the cognitive supremacy of reason, and the progressive nature of history. Unlike aesthetic modernism, which only strove to give voice to non-utilitarian values marginalized by modern society, popular mass culture destabilized the very bases of social and political modernity.
</p>

<p>
Theorists of the novel were, of course, profoundly aware of the inescapable ambivalence that the modernity of popular commercial culture provoked among many observers and often shared these ambivalences themselves. Luk&#x000E1;cs is perhaps the 

<b></b>

most interesting example of such a divided perspective. As is well known, in 1919 he entered the Communist Party of Hungary and repudiated his entire early career, which had been dedicated to the task of developing a comprehensive philosophy of cultural modernity.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This dramatic gesture was not just a sudden impulse provoked by the crisis of war. His reservations about the destabilizing implications of modernity were voiced as early as 1911 in his respectful yet critical obituary of Wilhelm Dilthey. In this writing, Luk&#x000E1;cs accused Dilthey of failing to bring to its logical conclusion his battle against "the 'scientific world view' and the 'positivist' sociology." Dilthey's valorization of everyday life and unstructured experience held the danger, Luk&#x000E1;cs argued, of relativism and subjectivism, unless completed by a cultural renaissance leading to a new vision of totality.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In 1918, he expressed the same reservations with neo-Kantianism in his obituary of Simmel, which was couched in almost identical terms as that of Dilthey. Simmel, too, appeared to Luk&#x000E1;cs as a "transitional philosopher" who helped repudiate ossified cultural forms but lacked the creative capacity and intellectual courage to complete the revolution he started. Simmel, like Dilthey, Luk&#x000E1;cs concluded, was among "the harbingers of a new classicism, which will represent the richness of life through comprehensive new forms that are based on stable and strict foundations."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs' conviction that the world of the novel was inevitably to be followed by a new age of integration and totality was not generally shared by theorists of the novel. For Bakhtin and for most of the other theorists with whom I have dealt in this paper, the world of the novel presented new opportunities for individual self-expression and innovation that amply compensated for the closed cultures they replaced. For them, the novel, with its heterogeneous gestures and openness to change, was the essential expression of human freedom and self-determination. It was, above all, the quintessential form in which modern life recognized itself. In Bakhtin's words, "studying other genres is analogous to studying dead languages; studying the novel, on the other hand, is like studying languages that are not only alive, but still young."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

Bakhtin associated the phenomenon of "Bovaryism" with the familiarity of the novelistic universe that allows readers to enter its frame as if it were reality. "It follows," he illustrated, "that we might substitute for our own life an obsessive reading of novels, or dreams based on novelistic models . . . Bovaryism becomes possible, the real-life appearance of fashionable heroes taken from novels&#x02014;disillusioned, demonic and so forth." "Epic and Novel," 32&#x02013;33.
