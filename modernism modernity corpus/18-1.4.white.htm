Folded and clenched, the best they can do is look at the floor, trying to bring into view a tiny slippered foot that could be miles away and certainly not big enough to support a literary giant [fig. 1]. As is the case with many images of writers, Minihan’s Beckett is rarely seen with the instrument of his craft. The act of writing, hardly the most photogenic of practices, takes place off scene. Pen stays mainly in pocket. The erotics of modern author portraiture demand either the before or the after, a build up of concentration or a moment of relaxation after the work is done. On the edge of a bed yet to be slept in, the courtship between photographer and subject begins. Glasses are removed but not put down. The right hand hangs on, so intent on staying clothed by what it grips that the ring finger must flex for purchase on the knee. The finger looks spastic, delinquent, arthritic even, but it’s the only thing stopping the further slide of the hand towards the dismal world of the slipper, a route its partner seems intent on taking, caterpillaring down a trouser leg.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>1 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">For the time being, right hand keeps carpet at arm’s length, observing it through spectacles wielded like a magnifying glass that miniaturizes the world until put near enough for gross detail. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Moving up and away [fig. 2], denuded of glasses whose imprint it still bears, the face is not sure where to look. The concentration of furrows across the brow point down with all the clarity of an arrow, as suggests the angle of the head also, but the eyes have a different idea.

And all of this propped up on the sparsest of armatures. When commissioned to produce a monument to Balzac, the sculptor Rodin imagined him sprung out of bed in the middle of the night, semi-conscious but fully erect with a great idea. The writer’s body, wrapped entirely in a gown, arms, hands and all, became merely a mass of sculptural framework engineered to support a colossal, leonine head, limbs melded into a single column in service of an oversized capital. Does Minihan’s Beckett share Balzac’s headiness? Not really. We would have to deploy great force to straighten him out into either a vertical eureka or a horizontal faint. As the veins in his hands show, he has been sitting like this for a while, not in a state of inspiration but one of intense thought: concentration rather than rapture. Although not columnar, he is nonetheless stiffened into a monument. With both arms extended identically, he has become something of a sphinx. The faint ribbing and weave in his jumper and trousers might hint at skin and bones beneath but, by and large, the high contrast of the photograph creates a single weightless, black shape of them, one which frames his hands below and face above. This silhouette carves Beckett out from the everyday stuff of the room all around him. We do not really need to know that this is a hotel room or to scrutinize the anonymous textiles and furniture which occupy it in order to sense that Beckett is not at home here. Nor is he, as so many writers find themselves when photographed, pinned against the bookshelves of his study. Apart from the bending sheets of books cast aside on the bed, the symbolic register of writ</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">ing has been dispensed with. His head is neatly mounted by the window frame to the right and bedstead below, occupying the most privileged space of the photograph, not just the full top third but the only area of blank background available. Not heady but still all head. In this improvised studio, light falls onto the subject from the front, etching the lines into his face, and from behind, eradicating obvious shadows and clipping the edge of his forehead, making it flush with the force of his deliberation. Placing face against space not only isolates it from the room and makes it so much the center of our attention; it allows the photographer to burn in every wrinkle and whisker, concentrating the force of the enlarger’s bulb onto this spot. The plane of focus passes through the eyes whose sharpness is enhanced by the already blurred right hand in front and edge of bed behind. Fully present in this photograph is only the countenance. Although stilled, Beckett’s face is all action, composing itself, ear, nose, eyes, lips all busy seeking his image. Although Minihan’s photography is one of candidness and informality, of which the setting speaks volumes, these images remain heavily encoded in the conventions of the portrait. From its nineteenth-century inception on, photography has always taken on the task that painting and sculpture had pursued for centuries, that of providing insight into the character of the individual subject. How might we read the person from the face? Rather than putting the pseudo-sciences of phrenology and physiognomy out of business, photography was their richest fertilizer. The demand for images of notable personalities was unabated.

In this collection of the great and the good, the exceptionality of such cultural celebrities was intended to be legible from their physical appearance. The cold glare of the camera exposed their human weaknesses at the very moment it asserted their genius. Little commented on but worth considering are the startling connections between portrait photography and caricature, perhaps because they seem at first sight so completely different, one a supposedly passive imprint of reality, the other a purposeful, expressive distortion of it.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">If we compare Minhan’s Beckett to that of the caricaturist Edmund Valtman, who drew the author in his Nobel Prize winning year, some aspects of each come strik</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">ingly into view [fig. 8]. As we have seen, the body plays little role in the projection of personality, made all the more apparent in the caricaturist’s habitual ploy of shrinking it to the extreme.

While the deadpan view was taken to its apogee in the aesthetics of an Andy Warhol, some still sought faces that could not lie, be they Paul Strand’s blind woman, Diane Arbus’s photos of the mentally ill, or Walker Evans’s photos of unsuspecting and often catatonic subway commuters. In his narration of his encounter with Beckett, Minihan tells how their meeting was mediated by the author’s interest in Minihan’s images of the small town of Athy in County Kildare which he took to show him (these are probably what we see strewn on the bed), including “a sequence on the wake of Kathy Tyrell at Sam’s suggestion” that would have included images of the deceased.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">What could be more expressionless than the face of a dead person whose inertness is made all the more compelling by the warm throb of mourners around her?

Neither in the hubbub of the interior nor out on the street, our table is in the DMZ of the terrace where Beckett can comfortably remain completely bundled up in heavy coat and scarf, and shrouded in the warmer glow of artificial light. A bulb flames just behind his ear and merges into the back of his head, bouncing its beam out the other side onto the roof of the canopy. The left hand is once again making to leave; it wants to push up out of the chair, but we don’t want to listen to it and keep it covered in darkness. The right hand will not relinquish a prop, still not a pen but this time a cigarette. It is extended toward us, more animated than the face of its owner whose attention has drifted to nowhere. The neckless head nestles in the folds of the scarf but keeps floating off it towards us; the camera’s focus brings it closer to us than the outstretched hand. Lamps, eyes, arm, and hand are all aligned along a powerful diagonal that turns the shoulders inward as much as it pushes the face outward. It puts a big cross at the point where this image stops being a photograph and becomes a portrait, tears it up, and throws it to the wind. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:194px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">WHITE / </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">portrait of the artist as an old man </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="margin-bottom:0px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10.5pt; color:#221E1F">Notes </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">837 </SPAN></H5><ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><LI><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">From the 1970s onward, Beckett suffered from Dupuyten’s contracture, “a gradual closing in</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">wards of the fingers of the hand . . . and its effects can be clearly seen in some of the later photographs of Beckett in which his right hand is visible.” Anthony Cronin, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">(London: Flamingo, 1977), 549. </SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">For a thorough account of Beckett’s deployment of photographs of himself through his career see Stephen John Dilks, “Portraits of Beckett as a Famous Writer,” </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Journal of Modern Literature </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">29.4 (Summer 2006): 161–188. </SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">One of the few analyses I have come across is Anne McCauley, “Caricature and Photography in Second Empire Paris,” </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Art Journal </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">43.4 (Winter 1983): 355–60.
