<p>
Gertrude Stein's texts have attracted a considerable number of book
illustrators. Before she acquired fame as a writer, Daniel-Henry
Kahnweiler, a German Jewish expatriate whose gallery promoted young
artists such as Picasso, Braque, L&eacute;ger, Gris, and Masson, published
two of her texts perhaps in homage to an informed collector. Much
later in her career, her children's book, <i>The World is Round</i>,
will require mimetic imagery suitable for young readers.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
When, long after her death, she had become an avant-garde icon,
experimental artists saw in her a kindred spirit. In this respect, she
rivals other modernists such as Joyce, Apollinaire, Mallarm&eacute;,
Rimbaud, Eluard, and Ponge whose challenging texts have attracted
avant-garde illustrators. The presence of Gertrude Stein in this
predominantly French group need not surprise us granted the number of
translations of her texts available to French readers.
<p>
Thanks to the publication of <i>A Book Concluding as a Wife has a Cow</i>
 and <i>The Village</i> , Gertrude Stein found herself in
good company, for the perceptive Kahnweiler had chosen as collaborators
for his painters soon to become famous writers such as Apollinaire,
Artaud, Jacob, Leiris, Malraux, and Reverdy.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Juan Gris, a close friend of Gertrude Stein, who had acquired several
of his paintings, contributed a cubistic accompaniment to her subtly
erotic text. Rather than reacting to the text, he provided a kind of
monument in honor of an art patron.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<b></b>

The neglected Elie Lascaux transformed <i>The Village</i>  into
a stele.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In his lithographs, he never forgets to treat <i>The Village</i> as a
play. In the first plate, he makes the village with its church steeple,
houses, and streets, fully visible as an architectural stage set enhanced
by decorative representations of the sun, clouds, and birds suspended
from above. In subsequent plates, the village functions simultaneously
as a backdrop, a curtain, and a frame for Stein's brief drama. Lascaux'
contribution consists in theatrically enshrining Stein's text in a
manner reminiscent of medieval illumination. The fact that he provided
a suitable village setting for the play suggests that he responded to
the title rather than to the hermetic English text.
<p>
Gertrude Stein's publications would have remained without further
adornment&#8212;apart from documentary photographs in her two
autobiographies and wartime texts&#8212;had she not composed two books for
children: <i>The World is Round</i>,  and <i>The First Reader</i>,
published posthumously in 1946.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Skillfully alternating between a decorative and a theatrical style,
Sir Francis Rose's drawings for <i>The World is Round</i>, published
in London the same year as the American edition, hardly depart from
humorous vignettes and <i>culs-de-lampe</i>. No less than Lascaux,
he has provided ornamental settings. A similar approach marks
his accompaniment to <i>The First Reader</i>. (<a name="1"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#1"> 1</a>)
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Thanks to the persuasiveness of William R. Scott, her New York
publisher, Stein actively collaborated with Clement Hurd, a pupil of
Fernand L&eacute;ger who specialized in the illustration of children's
books. Not surprisingly, Hurd provided the only closely programmed
not to say mimetic rendition of a Stein text. While insisting on the
visual consistency required in children's books, he showed originality
in combining striking imagery with imaginative page settings.
<p>
<i>The World is Round</i> displays many of the usual features of Stein's
style.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The title may strike grownups as no more than a truism but for young
readers, to whom the world's sphericity appears far from obvious, it
promises an initiation. As the narrative unfolds, Rose, an insecure
nine year old, plays an increasingly heroic part while her self-assured
cousin, Willie, remains steadfast throughout. As in most of Stein's
fictions, the key role invariably belongs to a female. The author's
well-known avoidance of stasis and containment results in a multiplicity
of outer-directed anecdotes. In rapid succession, she tells condensed
stories featuring chain enumerations. She thereby expresses acceleration
in time and extension in space while reminding the reader that the
world remains stubbornly round and suggesting that it whirls as in a
round dance. Although Stein repeatedly insists on the earth's rotundity,
she downgrades this universal truth to a fairy tale belief: "Once upon
a time the world was round and you could go on it around and around"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 1). Dominant at first, circularity eventually shares the
limelight with other directions. When Rose succeeds in arduously climbing
a mountain, her upward mobility somehow neutralizes the roundness that
obsesses her.
<p>
Shapes and directions prevail throughout, and color plays a highly
significant role. Stated in Stein's signature sentence at the very
beginning of the tale: "A rose is a rose is a rose" (<i>TWIR</i>,
1), the word designates a flower, a color, and a child. Misgivings
and reassurances concerning her colorful name and her identity recur
throughout. Rose repeatedly shows a preference for blue. She has blue
eyes and drags a blue garden chair to the summit of a blue mountain. We
can construe her eagerness to reach the

<b></b>

very top both as an idealistic aspiration as well as a compulsion. She
reacts intensely and repeatedly to all occurrences. She thinks, she talks,
she sings, she cries. Elation and worry succeed one another. Stein has
made Rose's songs, invariably followed by lamentations, an essential
part of the text. Indeed, they provide lyrical interludes while

<b></b>

stressing the importance of sound. Music joins forces with noises, for
instance the noise of her poodle lapping water. Sound patterns based on
rhyme and alliteration recur as frequently in <i>The World is Round</i>
as in other of Stein's poetic texts: "Dear me hair chair ran man"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 31), "blue just blue" (<i>TWIR</i>, 32), " . . . so it
was a very long way to go even if a mountain does not grow even so,
climb a mountain and you will know even if there is no snow. Oh no"
(<i>TWIR</i>, 37). The O's shape conjoins with sound. Indeed, this
visible phoneme echoes the earth's rotundity.
<p>
We may wonder to what extent Clement Hurd's illustrations conform to
Stein's disturbing and subverting writing. And how could he possibly
represent reiterated distinctions between body and mind hardly appropriate
in a children's book? The sound effects and phonetic play, so intimately
linked with other verbal aspects, show considerable independence in
regard to syntax, logic, and structure. She favors a language full
of vitality and apt to astonish her readers. The pink paper and blue
print chosen by Gertrude Stein herself pleasurably disturb our reading
habits while reinforcing the heroine's presence and even adding to her
substance. Hurd's designs, scenes, and landscapes strike us as flat and
streamlined, in keeping with imagery suitable to young readers as well
as with Stein's persistent present. He conveys rotundity by a round dance
where several animals, all of them featured in the text, step forward or
backward to participate in a moving circle. Although he represents the
animals according to different scales, he carefully preserves their chief
characteristics: the endless neck of the giraffe, the sturdy shape of the
elephant. The vitality of the imagery and its affinity with Stein arise
from a multiplicity of curly lines: spiral fragments counter balancing
simple linear contours. Accompanied by her white poodle, Rose in a white
dress holds a rose in her hand. This first illustration encompasses to
a large degree both the metaphoric and the anecdotal sides of the story
while foretelling many of the playful gestures characteristic of Stein.
<p>
Round shapes and signs appear more intermittently than in the text,
modified as spiral and elliptic objects, each one assigned a specific
role. On two occasions toward the end of the book, a round shaped map-like
re, echoing the text, makes an appearance. The blue chair Rose
takes with her in her ascent appears as far more than a mere object in
Hurd's interpretation. In its repeated recurrences in the illustrations,
this object becomes a personified spiral stage prop fully involved in
Rose's adventures.
<p>
Rose and Willie always appear separately in the graphics. We see Rose
in the opening illustration surrounded by wild animals and in close
proximity to a lion shaped, if not colored, like her poodle. We first
see Willie in a meditative posture, his back turned to an enlarged
lion's head undoubtedly groomed in the same parlor as Rose's dog. In
Hurd's representations, trees play a more important part than in the
text. They punctuate Rose's trajectory to the summit, and the most
rotund among them proudly carries the circular inscription of Rose's
name. (<a name="2" href="10.4hubert_res.html#2"> 2</a>)
Not only do these trees measure the little girl's ascent, but seem to
protect her from encroaching night before their replacement by a dark
irregularly shaped cloud abundantly sprinkled with stars.
<p>
We can hardly overlook the humor that Hurd derives from Stein's text. In
the opening illustration, his comic display of animals performing in
seeming unison even though they do not turn their heads and tails the
same way relates to Stein's personifications

<b></b>

by bridging all categories and barriers. (<a name="3"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#3"> 3</a>) When Hurd on the back
cover shows the hindquarters of the two lions, moving away from their
owner and the reader, they remain recognizable by the vibrations of their
curly hair. By behaving like circus performers or toys, his animals will
never threaten the most timorous child.
<p>
In collaboration with Clement Hurd, Arion Press published in 1986 a
limited edition of <i>The World is Round</i>. Instead of reproducing
the 1939 drawings, they transformed the Linotypes and woodcuts Hurd had
produced for the 1967 edition into

<b></b>

photo-engravings.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Andrew Hoyem's departure from earlier editions consists in
producing a perfectly circular volume housed in a metal box
and accompanied by an inflatable pink balloon. (<a name="4"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#4"> 4</a>) Thus, bookwork matters
most of all, for a circular volume demands considerable expertise in the
placing of both the text and the illustrations. Not only does circularity
suit to perfection Stein's title and themes, but it wheels the book
away from convention and speeds it toward adventure. When opened, the
book presents a succession of facing round pages containing either a
text or an illustration&#8212;

<b></b>

one per chapter. Deprived of images and margins, the text requires a
much tighter printing texture than in the 1939 and 1967 editions. At
the beginning, circular and spiral shapes occur quite frequently:
the circular or elliptic dance of the animals, the irregularly shaped
cloud, the lion attaining a global rotundity by moving from a profiled
to a frontal view. In keeping with the circular pages, the revised
graphics put all the emphasis on the prevalence of roundness in Stein's
text. Compared to Hurd's 1939 illustrations, those of the Arion Press
show a greater attempt at stylization. Clouds, stars, and sun, present
in the first edition, give way to less representational forms. The fur
or hair of the animals in the 1986 edition would hardly arouse tactile
desire. Featureless blue faces undermine Rose's and Willie's identity. And
as Hoyem reduces the color scheme to blue, white, and black, rose, the
featured color in the pink-papered original edition, appears only in the
accompanying inflatable balloon and the binding. By thus eliminating
details and colors and placing the emphasis on circularity, Hoyem has
somehow succeeded in increasing the reader's awareness of the upward
movement prevailing in the text. In carrying ever upwards the spiral
shaped chair, the heroine becomes more and more lively and purposeful. As
a result, she shows greater ability to move in the landscape. Striking
us as increasingly dramatic, concentrated, and powerful, the scenery
reaches its climax when Rose confronts the waterfall. The vegetation
has ceased to function as a mere accompaniment. Whereas in the original
version the leaves of grass and branches sprout gently from the ground,
in the circular volume they vigorously form labyrinthine clusters. And
as the branches embrace each other they get ready to form an aggressive
circle surrounding the little girl. Moreover, the dynamic and impinging
waterfall and, later, the intense light beam assailing the climber
transform the landscape into a menacing presence. (This refers back to
<a href="10.4hubert_res.html#4"> 4</a>)
<p>
Hoyem's transformation of Hurd's illustrated edition into an artist book
provides a middle ground between mimetic and performative illustration. A
number of artists, most of them with French connections, but with little
else in common than their deep involvement in visual interpretations of
literary masterpieces, have provided new settings for, and found new
meanings in, Gertrude Stein's often hermetic texts. Martine Saillard
whose Edition Traversi&egrave;re specializes in avant-garde texts,
persuaded a team of five international postmodern artists, all of whom
assemble and disassemble Stein's words in various ways, to react to
<i>Une Pi&egrave;ce circulaire</i> .
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
They are Jiri Kolar (Czech), Tom Phillips (British), Albert Ayme
(French), Arthur Aeschbacher (Swiss), and Brion Gysin (American).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Aur&eacute;lie de Nemours, a French hard-edge abstractionist,
Mathew Tyson, a British minimalist residing in France, Irma Blank,
an Italian whose rhythmic writing deconstructs conventional meaning,
Shirley Sharoff, an American etcher and bookworker residing in Paris,
Barbara Fahrner, a German who has illustrated Schwitters, Celan, and
Cage for Granary Books, and the American Susan Weil, an illustrator
of <i>Finnegan's Wake,</i> who studied painting at the &Eacute;cole
Julian in Paris before joining the Black Mountain group, have achieved
remarkable results in accompanying texts by Gertrude Stein.

<b></b>

<p>
Initiated by Edouard Manet in 1874, the Parisian "livre de peintre" has
recently become an American institution. Granary Books, Kaldewey, Vincent
Fitzgerald in New York, Arion, Brighton, Lapis in California have, among
others, produced many innovative limited editions featuring graphics by
major artists. Moreover, these publishers have insisted on letterpress,
fast becoming an endangered craft in France. The Fitzgerald/Susan Weil's
edition of Gertrude Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i>, no less than other
productions of this press, provides interpretive displays worthy of the
literary masterpieces they accompany.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The binding with its strategic insertions of seven etched vignettes,
the elegant and eminently readable letterpress, the plates framed in
perfect squares divided into nine equally square etchings, and the
various vignettes skillfully collaged on the printed pages convey a
sense of order contrasting with the apparent randomness of <i>Tender
Buttons</i>. We can assume that Weil and Fitzgerald have sought to
reveal the hidden tightness of Stein's organization.
<p>
In some respects, we can regard Weil's graphics for <i>Tender Buttons</i>
as programmed insofar as she has provided readily recognizable, if
fragmented, representations of objects featured in the text. But in
all other respects, her graphics in this carefully produced American
"livre de peintre" clearly emphasizes performance notably by means
of visual quotations. By including details from Picasso's famous
portrait she alludes to cubist influences in the poetry. Moreover,
she dwells repeatedly on Stein's eyes and hands as though to insist
on observation and manipulation not only on the part of the author of
<i>Tender Buttons</i> but of her own critical activity in reacting to
the poems. In any case, Weil goes beyond the target text in order to
take into account such biographical

<b></b>

considerations as Stein's rapport with Picasso and her patronage of
art. Nor do the etchings neglect other aspects of Stein's existence,
notably her relationship with Alice B. Toklas covertly evoked in <i>Tender
Buttons</i>, perhaps even in its potentially erotic title.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Indeed, the sensual coloration of the binding, the set of flesh colored
etchings appearing early in the book, the brightly colored plates
corresponding to the section on <i>Food</i>, and the photogravures of
<i>Rooms</i> evoke the more intimate aspects of the poems. And in the
very first plate of <i>Rooms</i>, we can identify the two faceless
women as Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.
<p>
Stein's division of the book into three separate but nonetheless
interrelated sections may have led to Weil's division of the plates
into nine perfect squares, a procedure that has allowed her to frame
programmatic elements within modernist grids. Walker has clearly
explained the division of <i>Tender Buttons</i> into three parts:
"From the external objects we see and touch, the text moves inward to
the substances we ingest and, in the final section, outward again to the
spaces that surround us" (<i>MOAM</i>, 127). Weil's graphic accompaniment
moves in the same direction insofar as the etchings in the first section
emphasize linear precision, the enticing colors as well as the presence
of digestive organs in the second suggest ingestion, and the framed
photogravure portraits in the third require a surrounding space. However,
Weil's regularity hardly corresponds to Stein's uneven alignment of texts
ranging from one or two lines to several pages. The first plate assembles
fragments of portraits, derived not only from Picasso's but also from
photographs representing the author. Weil has felicitously juxtaposed and
harmonized details or fragments of these portraits so that the plate as
a whole evokes a cubist engraving. A similar maneuver operates even more
tellingly in the plate immediately preceding <i>Objects</i>, no doubt
because the things displayed in these linear etchings, e.g. fragments of
an umbrella, clockwork, a chair, a cup more clearly approximate cubistic
themes than do parts of the body such as eyes, a nose, or hands. (<A
NAME="5" href="10.4hubert_res.html#5"> 5</a>) More
painterly than those that precede, the second plate in the <i>Rooms</i>
section distances itself somewhat from cubist etching. Stein's frequent
mentions of boxes and other containers amply justify Weil's constricting
squares. In any case, the artist has elaborated an original rendition
of cubist substitution and displacement. The final plate in which
nine photogravures replace etched fragments features framed pictures,
including portraits of Gertrude Stein, art patron and framer of words,
while referring to the cubists' practice of overdetermining inner framing
within their paintings.
<p>
No doubt the repetitions of recognizable fragments from one plate to the
next correspond to Stein's incessant verbal reiterations, substitutions
and exchanges. Even more obviously, the fragments displayed in the
graphics correspond to the various objects and foods mentioned in
<i>Tender Buttons</i>, notably in the titles of individual poems. Words
such as "time," "hour," and especially "change" become visual in the bits
of clockwork that reappear in several plates. Preserved forever in the
etched squares, these clockwork fragments, these frozen moments suggest
measured and spatialized time rather than duration in the Bergsonian sense
of the term. Nonetheless, <i>Tender Buttons</i> also involves experienced
time together with instances of a simultaneous present more easily
expressed in music than in graphic art. Painting as well as cubist collage

<b></b>

can show precise moments in time rather than its passage. It would
seem, therefore, that Weil has captured the immobilized essence of
Stein's text and derived from it a compelling work of art comparable
to the early cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque. Moreover, by
restricting to some extent identity and memory, Weil's fragmentation
would facilitate&#8212;and certainly not preclude&#8212;the creation
of masterpieces.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
However, two fragments featuring handwritten words partly obscured by
shadows clearly introduce process and duration. And the flesh-colored
plate in which the etched fragments tend to infringe upon one
another's borders, clearly imply movement, all the more so because
of the presence of birds in flight, a constant theme in Weil's if not
Stein's repertoire. Here at least, the artist asserts herself alongside
the writer while expressing movement in time. Seven of the etchings,
repeated in the first plate, adorn the binding. The face and hands of
Picasso's portrait appear on the back cover while etchings borrowed
from other sources surround the embossed title on the front cover.

<b></b>

We have the distinct impression that these fragments represent the five
senses: seeing, smelling, and tasting on the front cover, touching and
hearing on the back. And why would Stein close her eyes if not to hear
music? The five senses play conspicuous parts in <i>Tender Buttons</i>.
<p>
Although <i>Tender Buttons</i> clearly shows the influence of early
cubism, Stein, according to Walker, owes just as much to Picasso's and
Braque's collages of 1912 and 1913 that included pieces of newspaper,
oil cloth, tickets, cut-out pictures: mundane objects lifted from the
"real" world (<i>MOAM</i>, 130). The surprising insertion of heterogeneous
found objects into a painterly order has much in common with the verbal
jumbling characteristic of <i>Tender Buttons</i>. Thus, this most orderly
and precise "livre de peintre" takes into account Stein's decentered
and decentering texts. Susan Weil's and Vincent Fitzgerald's bookwork
consists in part of the systematic displacement of graphics submitted
to geometric constraints.
<p>
Whereas the graphics for <i>Tender Buttons</i> and the two versions of
<i>The World is Round</i> overtly relate to the text, we can hardly make
the same claims for the other works we discuss. Spiritual values and
personal feelings inform the works of abstractionists such as Kandinsky
while an inner sense of proportion marks the work of a minimalist such
as Elsworth Kelly.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Since outside objects and events impinge only indirectly on their
paintings and graphics, we can treat their art as a kind of performance
not unlike music. Minimalists and abstractionists have illustrated
literary works with built in programs but so have composers.
<p>
In 1988, Mathew Tyson, like his father, Ian, a noted book artist,
accompanied Gertrude Stein's <i>Five Short War Poems</i> with five
"minimal" hand drawings.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Written in conversational style, these texts dwell typically on an all
encompassing present. As usual, numerous personal pronouns deliberately
elude unambiguous references to specific people, objects, or places. And
Stein relies once again on repetition, alliteration, and rhyme. As the
title indicates, the poems involve war and, if we take a recurrent
language barrier into account, the relationships between American
soldiers and French people&#8212;particularly French women. Instead of
providing direct descriptions of such obvious characteristics of warfare
as horrendous destruction, heroic deeds, and heart-rending lamentations,
Stein by indirection points to recognizable aspects of the situation
of American troops at the front in World War I. More often than not,
she leaves to our imagination whatever horrors may have happened at
the front. In "An "Incident":





<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<i>Do not be harsh to the misses</i>
<br />
<i>I am full of kisses</i>
<br />
As the soldier said in English the
<br />
Nurses did not understand.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<p>
We can perhaps define the speaker as a battlefield casualty presently
under the care of French nurses. Stein keeps war at a distance in a
systematic state of denial. Nor can we know for certain whether "misses"
refers to "mademoiselles from Armenti&egrave;res" or to bullets that
missed their mark. In other texts, notably "America," Stein relies on

<b></b>

questions: "Are we brave," "Are we true," "Have we red cross."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Although the personal pronoun refers to American soldiers, the identity
of the questioner remains at the very least complex insofar as the
American warriors may, indeed, have asked themselves these questions in
response to French observers, the poet all the while functioning as an
unreliable interpreter, sometimes relying on clich&eacute;s. In several
of the texts, weather plays an important part. Instead of describing
the utter misery of foot soldiers living and dying in muddy trenches,
Stein in "Can you imitate disaster" needs only to mention "Verdun" and
"weather."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
In "America," the suffering and dangers of long marches leading to
confinement in flooded trenches make their presence felt as "A great
many people speak of feet/And socks."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
"Won," which may or may not allude to a triumphant attack by American
forces, features "Aunt Pauline" running out of oil.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
This "Aunt Pauline," the only actant mentioned by name, may designate
the Ford car Stein had ordered from America and that she and Alice
Toklas had put to the service of France. In brief, Stein dwells on
warfare while minimizing its brutal effects. Full of surprises, war
nonetheless always remains the same.
<p>
No less than Stein's poems, Tyson's minimal drawings involve
warfare. Indeed, they evoke the fundamental horror the poet
had so carefully left in abeyance. The pitch black drawings
aggressively connect with atrocities, in the ordinary as
well as the etymological meaning of the term. (<a name="6"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#6"> 6</a>) The very blackness of
the thick drawn lines intensifies their stark evocation of barbed wire,
crosses, and death. The illustrations begin and end with a perfect
circle, not as an indication of the circularity of Stein's world, but
of a kind of illusory completion as negative as barbed wire. We may
wonder why Tyson photocopied and collaged the printed texts onto thick
cardboard paper instead of inscribing them directly on the pages as he
had the drawings. The typography resembles a typescript rather than
proper printing. It puts into sharp relief the minimal drawings that
somehow contain the enshrouded meanings of the poems. The artist has
collaged the titles of these texts at the top and the extreme right of
an otherwise empty page as though to emphasize the typographical poverty
of the following texts, obliged to face the sinister blackness of the
drawings. The artist has avoided all biographical and bibliographical
references concerning the composition and previous publication of the five
poems. In keeping with Stein's pervasive present, Tyson substitutes for
an irrelevant past the omnipresence of death. While evoking implements
of mortality on the battlefield, the drawings have much in common with
penmanship. The hand-drawn and scripted images visually overwhelm the
neutral typescript.
<p>
In spite of all these differences, author and artist stand in relationship
to war and reality at about the same distance. Tyson's minimal drawings
and Stein's understated texts have little in common with descriptive
representations of World War I, either graphic or literary. But artist
and writer display similar powers of evocation and may have provided
the reader with a deeper understanding of war than many a blow by blow
account.
<p>
A "minimalist" quite different from Tyson, for she favors pure color,
Aur&eacute;lie Nemours, a well known painter who exhibits at the Denise
Ren&eacute; gallery in Paris, chose "Early and Late," a poem written in
1925 and published in 1953 in <i>Bee Time Vine</i>.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<b></b>

The graphics consist of seven "Bleischnitte," similar to woodcuts:
four large squares each of a single color: blue, black, yellow and
red, two small black and yellow squares placed side by side, two small
blue and red squares placed one above the other, and a large square
assembling the four small squares. However attractive, these colorful
squares have very little in common with Stein's repetitious and rhythmic
writing, particularly in evidence in a free verse poem such as "Early
and Late." Nonetheless, the four colors may correspond to the four
characters who play the most important roles in the poem: Celestine,
Paul, Eugene, and Esther. Mentioned only once, Odile, Bonnington and
Jo, by joining the four protagonists, attain the number seven thus
accounting, so to speak, for the seven engravings. We may discover
a deeper correspondence between the images and the poem in the fact
that all the squares, even when printed on the same page, never touch
one another. This deliberate separation corresponds to "Early and Late"
where separation predominates, particularly in the wording of the title,
often repeated in the text. Moreover, Stein multiplies divisions

<b></b>

and separations not only in time but in everything else. And to complicate
matters still further, she introduces a number of contradictions and
paradoxes. Two words: "bridge" and "connect" provide, or so it would seem,
a mitigating factor insofar as they run counter to separation. However,
bridging and connecting must inevitably fail in a poem entitled
"Early and Late." They perform asymptotically in their failure to reach
their goal. In this respect, we might regard Nemours' accompaniment as
anti-illustration. Indeed, she creates a kind of spiritual order quite
removed not only from the real world but also from any overt meanings.
<p>
The loose leaf volume itself, and not only the imagery, emphasizes
separation. Printed in small capitals and punctuated by periods, the
English text on the left confronts Helmut Heissenb&uuml;ttel's German
translation on the right. Printed in regular typography, the unpunctuated
German text defies convention by eschewing all capital letters. However,
indentations indicate the divisions into paragraphs and sentences of
Stein's poem. By a strange reversal of normal indentation, each new
paragraph starts far back in the margin. Grouped together, the colored
squares follow the English and German texts but precede de la Tour's
French translation, the only text printed in the expected manner. In other
words, separation and differentiation characterize the various aspects
of the volume that by means of clever bookwork becomes an ideal recipient
for "Early and Late." Rather than referring to the poem as such, the four
colors may represent the four creators: Stein, Heissenb&uuml;ttel, de la
Tour, and Nemours herself. However, by frustrating an analytical approach
in favor of a meditative appreciation, Nemours' colored squares may
induce a receptive mood on the part of readers of Stein's hermetic text.
<p>
Irma Blank, a prolific book artist, published in 1994 in Livorno <i>No
Words,</i> a small book, tightly bound, in which the abundant whiteness
of both the binding and the Japanese folded pages contrasts with black
typography and illegible script.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
As her other books demonstrate, the artist shows an irresistible
attraction toward Mallarm&eacute;'s blank pages. Based on Gertrude
Stein's <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>, <i>No Words</i>, elegantly
printed in Garamond lettering by a skilled typographer, qualifies as
an artist book insofar as Blank has assumed multiple tasks.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In addition to functioning as inventor and designer, she performs
as a reader and a writer&#8212;as a reader because the pages on
the left side display selections from Gertrude Stein's second
autobiography, as a writer because she transcribes on the
right side what we as readers identify with Stein's texts as a
wordless and illegible but highly regular script. (<a name="7"
href="10.4hubert_res.html#7"> 7</a>) An Italian translation
of the Stein selections appears at the end of the book as though
Blank wanted her Italian readers to know something about <i>Everybody's
Autobiography</i>. The colophon mentions 963 available volumes in arabic
numerals and 36 in Roman in addition to an original work by Irma Blank,
thus confirming her identity as an artist.
<p>
<i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> provides voluminous accounts, personal
historical, and sociological. It features strong contrasts while
conveying a wider field of awareness than the <i>Autobiography of Alice
B. Toklas</i>.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> might at first seem incompatible with
Blank's miniature and impersonal volume which has inherited

<b></b>

some of Mallarm&eacute;'s transcendentalism. The Italian artist
usually selects short passages from the autobiography without
disturbing the author's order, thus assuring a rather unified and one
directional process. Although the chosen passages, paragraphs, and
sentences reveal the breadth of Stein's interests, Blank tends to omit
narrative and reduces the anecdotal and even the ironic side of the
autobiography. Moreover, the personalities of the artists frequented
by Stein fade into the background. Judging by Stein's title alone, one
might infer that individuality and identity rather than universality
form the crux of her autobiographical book, an inference that the
extracts fail to confirm. Reflections on artistic production as well as
comparisons between writing and painting surface here and there in <i>No
Words</i>. It would seem that Blank appropriates Stein's text by stressing
what she considers essential and by assuming the role of "Everybody" while
asserting herself through daring and skillful manipulation. She joins
Gertrude Stein's "Everybody" while creating her own unrepeatable style
of continuous, letterless, wordless but rhythmic penmanship. Curtailment
has resulted in radical changes by giving greater esthetic consistency
to a text that deliberately proceeds in a multiplicity of directions and
indirections. Willfully or not, Blank, even if she has disposed only of
the left sides of the pages, has created her own emphasis and shifted

<b></b>

toward her own credo. In addition to challenging Stein's loquacious
sequel to <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> with her brief
selections or digest, she has substituted for Stein as an author writing
in a readable language an illegible continuum. Perhaps she has striven
for a non-referential language, far closer to graphics than to prose or
poetry. In her own script, she has forsaken any possibility of linking
up with Stein or even with "Everybody."
<p>
Can we consider Blank's inscription an attempt at modernization by its
quasi mechanical regularity? Such an attempt would mean that she has
distanced herself from the original text even further than Broodthaers in
his reduction of <i>Un Coup de d&eacute;s</i> to a byplay of concealing
lines.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The transformation of an autobiographical text into an unrelieved
visual continuum has limitations insofar as Blank, while distancing
herself from the literary and linguistic side of Stein's text, may
have deliberately neglected to assert herself fully as a visual artist,
either modern or postmodern. She has merely appended a signature that
prolongs itself as long as the author's words move along on the opposite
page. Its inevitable curtailment abolishes Blank's ambition to make
<i>No Words</i> at once "Everybody"'s and her own autobiography. In so
doing, Blank has revealed in her own way the meaning of Stein's title:
an author who attributed her creativity alternatively to Alice B. Toklas
and to "Everybody" although we can hardly regard the lifestyle of this
self-proclaimed but ironic genius as modest and self-effacing. Whereas
Hurd, Hoyem, Weil, and even Tyson, in their interpretations of Stein's
texts, aimed at showing some sort of correspondence between text and
image, Blank pursued a quite different goal, that of appropriation,
in turning a radically reduced text into a new book.
<p>
Shirley Sharoff harmoniously combines abstract etching with intricate
bookwork. Her endeavor in "Procession" strikes us as somewhat more
complex than those of other illustrators insofar as she succeeds in
deriving from a short text a full-fledged artist book departing in new
ways from standard practice.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Accompanied neither by a definite or indefinite article, the title
discourages the reader from singling out a specific procession or
looking for a representative model. Rather, the unaccompanied noun
multiplies possibilities while discouraging description. Far from
programming scenes and pictures, the title word immediately joins
forces, either by sound or etymology, with terms such as "possession"
and "process." Such alliances and affinities mark the poem throughout
for Stein has indeed created a progression of rhymes and repetitions.
<p>
Like several texts of <i>Tender Buttons</i>, "Procession" compounds
prose and poetry without subscribing to the usual practices of prose
or poetry. Nor does it proceed in a linear or other predictable
fashion. Readers will at no stage focus on a given procession. The
very first word, an imperative, "proceed," will, when obeyed, set the
whole process&#8212;we the readers included&#8212;into motion. Movement,
of course, inevitably functions as an indispensable aspect not only of
processions, but also of writing and reading. The initiating command will
soon give way to spontaneity, the triumphant other, in Gertrude Stein's
work, of ordering. So as to adjust to Stein's processional procedures,
we have to abandon all hope of finding a fixed location or a reliable
point of

<b></b>

view. Alternating between the one and the many, Stein's procession
generates movements in a multiplicity of straight, bent, circular, and
zigzag (in)directions. Faced with the improbability that immobility
has set itself in motion, we can assume that Stein has secretly
maneuvered among several processions in space and time both as a viewer
and a participant. Additions, substitutions, adjustments, and even
defections function as basic elements in a procession. But the question
of multiplicity and singleness, so Stein suggests, involves various
presences and absences within the procession. Plurality implies at the
very least the possibility of arrivals and departures, full, partial
and/ or intermittent, dependent and/ or autonomous. The author looks at,
speaks about, views, and catches many participants in the parade. Everyday
consumer products such as "oil" and "cheese" intersect and interact with
concerns about language. We can regard these concrete and mental aspects
as appropriate to a procession. A crowd of personal pronouns which,
more often than not, avoid specific designations of people or objects,
serve mainly to increase and expand relationships. By performing both
as a direct and an indirect voice in the poem, the author plays an
assortment of active and passive roles, and nothing prevents her from
substituting one personal pronoun for another. The participants designated
by nouns and pronouns do not necessarily belong to humanity. Sheep, even
furry sheep, as well as other animals provide suitably woolgathering
examples. This neglect of barriers adds ironic twists and turns to the
procession. Family relationships and even surprising political accusations
involving warfare compound the range of possibilities. The parts of
the poem, whether divided or not by numbers, bear little resemblance to
each other. Numbers suggest an operative organizing principle, but it
so happens that Stein herself deliberately undermines every expectation
of continuity and coherence with the notable exception of sound patterns
that transform the procession into a mock-processional.
<p>
Rather than a coherent chronicle of an outward event, Stein provides
us with suggestions concerning her struggle as a writer, a sporadic
and always unfulfilled but nonetheless satisfying battle. Occurring
far apart from one another, "bestow" and "possession" increase our
awareness of the impact of Stein's procession of words always surging
into view but always lagging behind, necessarily overtaken, outstripped,
and otherwise removed by an absolute present. Throughout the poem, the
author proposes and immediately discourages the establishment of expected
or even unexpected links between past and present. Occurring toward the
end of the text, the terms "success" and "succeed" appear particularly
revealing. Although they invariably question or postpone meaning in
relation to events or situations, these two terms as well as "follow" and
"replace" ironically assert their double allegiance. From the standpoint
of creative affabulation, such deliberate hesitations and shifts lead to
the opposition or reconciliation of "fact or fiction." Truth can never
accede to certainty. Fumbling for expressions and shuttling between
different possibilities always raise new counterproposals and retorts
far more evocative than direct solutions that might put an end to the
esthetic search. Energy will prevent the arrest and confinement of the
animated procession. "Procession" gives evidence of the special kind of
realism that, according to Lynn Hejinian, marks the writing of <i>Tender
Buttons</i>. Elements of a felt and perceived reality

<b></b>

and words considered an "order of reality," all of them placed on the
same footing, assemble and march along in "Procession."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Printed on v&eacute;lin d'arches, Shirley Sharoff's <i>Procession</i>
displays many features of "livres de peintres," including a detailed
colophon. Housed like many "livres de peintres" and a few artists'
books, Shirley Sharoff's edition of "Procession" demands on the part of
the reader and viewer attentive care in opening it. Sharoff rightfully
implies that far from reducing our viewing and reading of such a book to
a casual encounter, we should wind our way toward it. Refraining from
binding the text and the engravings together, the artist has enclosed
loose leaves in a solid box. She no doubt felt that a glued or sewn text
would hardly suit Stein's loosely formed, detached, and free moving
procession. Although the text never departs from the one originally
printed in <i>Programme</i>, it strikes us as quite different. Intricate
typography and spacing replace ordinary linear printing. Every page,
every paragraph, every sentence has freed itself from the conventions of
continuous alignment. Each passage imposes its own spacing and, thereby,
its own shape, thus avoiding any resemblance to a typical page image. Not
only has Sharoff added etchings to the text and, in collaboration with
the master printer Da Ros, created unique typographical arrangements
in shaping a unique kind of artist book, but she has included a French
translation. While making the book available to a French public, it also
extended the typographical domain of Sharoff's <i>Procession</i> as the
setting of the French text by no means follows that of the English. While
the translator has semantically and even phonetically done full justice
to Stein's writing, the French no less than the English text asserts
its own patterns in harmony with one another. By behaving like dancing
partners keeping in step with one another, they form an ordered procession
contrasting with the seeming disorder of Stein's text. Indeed, we can
hardly regard Sharoff's postmodern bookwork as subservient.
<p>
Almost every page displays an etching accompanying a printed section. The
book features five black and white grids inscribed directly on the page
and all of them, with the exception of the slightly truncated final
one, complete and nine mostly colored fragmentary images printed on
small squares of paper and pasted onto the page. Varying from etching
to etching, coloring serves to highlight the separations between
the different patches whereas the black and white grids show greater
unity and cohesion because of the relative absence of open or blank
spaces. Two or three assemblages of fragments precede the completed
etching as though in the act of forming a procession or moving toward
it. We might infer that the embedded grids firmly etched into the page
mark a fixed emplacement within which the mostly colored and purportedly
mobile fragments seek a location. Perhaps they metamorphose into the
embossed white lines seemingly tracing pathways through each completed
engraving. Etchings placed within a book in relation to the given text
appear to function as illustration. But in <i>Procession</i>, we can
hardly trace back any of the images, whether complete or fragmentary,
to a given passage in the poem. Indeed, we can hardly consider any of
them visual equivalents of verbal constructs. We may wonder, however,
whether the very avoidance of objective references in the poem's various
levels of concreteness finds an echo in the complex lines and map-like
designs as well as in the repeated numeration and

<b></b>

lettering of the etchings. The numerals and letters we can so easily
identify in the engravings flaunt the same lack of referentiality as
Stein's personal pronouns. But perhaps letters and numbers substitute
for the various aspects of reality positively or negatively alluded
to in the text. In any case, we search in vain for people and sheep,
for oil and cheese in these abstract graphics where jumbled numbers and
letters fulfill at the very least a visual function.
<p>
Sharoff has emphasized repetition in her graphic accompaniment. Although
hardly identical to one another, the black and white etchings display
many similarities. A comparison among them reveals intricate patterns
of changing lines and movements as well as different divisions. Because
the density of lines, hatchings, letters, and numbers varies from plate
to plate, we might even see them as a juxtaposition of regions through
which the procession must proceed. Nonetheless, the etchings may very
well combine the procession with its succession of emplacements since
we may regard the fragments themselves as locations set in motion. The
lack of clearly definable barriers between place and procession appears
highly suitable to a poem that so often negates the constructs it has
just proposed. Moreover, within the completed plates an emphasis on
straightness contrasts with the irregular curved embossing dividing
each one while gaps tend to separate fragments from one another. In
comparing these fragments to the complete engraving where each one will
relocate, we immediately realize that the placements of the former
within the glued on square in no way correspond to their final black
and white insertion in the completed plate. And it takes a rewarding
effort on the part of the viewer to follow each fragment to its final
destination. We might even claim that the twisting and turning progression
of the fragments characterizes the twists and turns that mark Stein's
procession and process, which must of course come to an end if not a
conclusion. Sharoff shows her awareness of this inevitable outcome by
ending her graphic accompaniment with a cutout, also suggesting absence,
through which emerges a section of Da Ros's typography. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#8"> 8</a>)
<p>
We now return to the very beginning of <i>Procession</i> which,
as soon as we remove the loose-leaf volume from its red enclosure,
greets us with cutouts of a different sort. (<a name="9"
HREF="10.4hubert_res.html#9"> 9</a>) At first we view, in
lieu of a proper title page, <i>Procession</i> printed in large ornate
characters setting an elegantly meandering itinerary from top to bottom
and from left to right. This title occupies parts of six sinuous strips of
paper, three of which unfold at the top of the book and three on the left
side. We can still read the title with the left strips unfolded but in
three different types consisting of the four remaining ornate capitals,
of two roman capitals, and of three lower case roman letters. It so
happens that this "title page" cut from two sheets provides a preview
of the entire volume. The divided title moves from a striking design
to a surprising assemblage of conflicting but nonetheless meaningful
lettering. The six sinuous strips evoke a procession moving in different
directions. Viewed as a whole, these strips not only display the title,
but the numerous divisions thus formed have much in common with the
shaped fragments in search of an emplacement. Not only do the fancy
letters defy linearity, but they stage a spectacular performance worthy
of Stein's statement concluding Part I: "That is a beautiful procession
and full of meaning too." And thus, even

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 697]</b>

before we reach the first page of the volume, we realize that we cannot
view a page as a unity and that we shall have to deal with complexity
and multiplicity.
<p>
All aspects of the book&#8212;the title page, the plates, the typography,
the accompanying translation, and even the final cutout&#8212;refer
in one way or another to a procession without any need to mimic the
various scenarios of Gertrude Stein's poem. Moreover, the ever moving
plates, by the denial of the inevitable fixity of book illustrations
and by the interference of a French text, simultaneously reproducing
and differing from the original, somehow remain in keeping with Stein's
quirky but marvelously effective approach to writing. Shirley Sharoff has
converted Stein's methodology and modernist liberation from conventions
into a graphic performance consisting of a coherent series of abstract
constructions.
<p>
Barbara Fahrner has contributed her share to the development of "livres
de peintres" in America by illustrating texts by Schwitters and Celan
for Granary books. Her graphic accompaniment of <i>4 Poems</i> of Celan
consists of a transcription and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne rather than an
illustration of the texts.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
In her one-of-a-kind book devoted to "Parlor," Fahrner has in a similar
manner provided a mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and staging of Stein's short play.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
As a dramatist, Stein more often than not dispenses with the usual
accoutrements of playwriting such as dialogue, plot, clearly defined
characters and recognizable settings. By mentioning the two spellings
of "parlo(u)r" she insists on the importance of writing. Rather than
as theater, we can define them as plays on words and situations. The
title lends itself to semantic displacements. It can refer to a typical
lower middle-class parlor located in Lynn, Massachusetts, belonging to
two sisters who presumably receive therein cousins and friends. But
it can also refer to a "parloir", for instance the one belonging to
the convent of "Les S&#156;urs de Saint Vincent de Paul," located rue
du Bac next to "Le Bon March&eacute;"&#8212;a short walk from Stein's
apartment rue de Fleurus.
<p>
Although the two New England siblings named Earle have little to do
with convent sisters, Stein constantly throws them together only to pull
them asunder a sentence or so later. Nonetheless, they do share certain
characteristics: the Earle sisters, who hardly belong to the aristocracy,
face poverty while the nuns have vowed to remain poor. But we cannot
limit the meaning of parlor to emplacement since the etymology of the
word stresses conversation. In many convents, the nuns could converse
only in the "parloir." In any case, Stein throughout the play compounds
the spatial and conversational meanings of "parlor" in the same way that
she lumps together the inseparable Earle siblings and a community of
"S&#156;urs de la Charit&eacute;." As sundering and joining together
mark the entire play as well as Fahrner's mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, parlor
functions in the manner of a pun whose dissonant meanings preclude
stability. Thanks to the substitution of "and" for "de" the saintly
founder of "les s&#156;urs de la charit&eacute;" divides&#8212;or
proliferates&#8212;into two saints: Vincent and Paul, who, with "Sister
Peter," provide masculine names for three of the nuns. Moreover, all these
disparate sisters can metamorphose into roses: "The seven sisters." By
such means, Stein has eliminated any danger of stability and fixity. In
this respect, she emulates Saint Vincent de Paul whose nomadic

<b></b>

nuns did not at first reside in a convent or need a "parloir." Seemingly
arbitrary, but nonetheless relevant displacements of various sorts,
predominate. We learn, for instance, that "Louise Henry Earle was not
born in Texas but in Lynn Massachusetts." And just before evoking
the nuns, Stein interpolates: "I am grateful to the Uruguan. This
is a saying." Does the author show gratitude for a geographical or
a verbal displacement or reveal once again the self-referentiality
of her composition? In any case, spatial and verbal accumulations and
dispersions follow one another during the entire play. We move from the
restricting quarters of a nondescript New England parlor circa 1897 to
the equally restrictive but nominally far more charitable "parloir" in
a convent. But the movement itself&#8212;the displacement&#8212;matters
most of all because of the mercurial interrelationships brought about
by language, the only operative commodity. As usual, Stein adds inner
displacements to the more overt sort by bringing in failures of memory:
"The Earle sisters have now been forgotten just as a memory." And memory
produces a displacement by ironically creating a cleavage between the
performative play and the situation of the writer: "It is difficult to
remember anything oh how difficult."
<p>
As her title indicates, Barbara Fahrner has provided a
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and thus more than an illustration of, or, as had
Elie Lascaux, a setting for, Gertrude Stein's play. This title appears
all the more appropriate insofar as Stein in so many of her writings
creates, as Jacky Martin states, "une mise en sc&egrave;ne du langage"
in which words operate like actants in a spectacle.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Indeed, Stein, notably in her plays, <i>Tender Buttons</i>, and
"Procession," drastically reduces the distances separating words,
characters, objects, and feelings. The mottled gray elongated cover of
Fahrner's <i>Parlor</i>, stitched down the middle with black thread,
suggests a stage curtain while evoking the divisions and separations
prevalent in both the text and its graphic staging. The fragments of a
column on the back and front covers may evoke a stage proscenium or even
the theater itself. When we open the volume, we notice immediately that
the gutter separating the two facing pages allows textual and graphic
crossovers in keeping with Stein's numerous verbal displacements. The
neatly handwritten script of "Play," moving horizontally from one side
of the double page to the other, must compete with an ineligible text,
couched in a sort of microwriting by the same hand, and spiraling crazily
in an upward direction. However, Fahrner's name appears together with
the date of composition embedded in four horizontal lines featuring
incipient or minimal microwriting. We can conclude that the purely
visual script bridges the gap between text and graphics all the more
so because the linear drawings themselves resemble writing. Fragmented
black and red lines follow, but with greater regularity, the mostly
perpendicular direction of the microwriting. Together, they form porous
enclosures vaguely suggesting a parlor and, paradoxically, a face,
perhaps that of a sibling or a nun. (.<a name="0" href="10.4hubert_res.html#0"> 10</a> &amp;   <a name="1" href="10.4hubert_res.html#1">11</a>) We may also
regard the blotches of solid color, some of them shaped like maps, that
greet the reader on each double page as marking the fleeting presence
of the two Earle sisters and the three named nuns. In any case, persons
and places appear to coalesce in these undefined res. Friends and
cousins, together with their places of origin, emerge in the guise of
partially colored blotches. Fahrner has introduced

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 700]</b>

in addition geometrical and architectural shapes in keeping with the
drawing on the title page, evoking, or so it seems, aspects of a parlor,
a house, a theater, or a convent.
<p>
Known as a penetrating reader of texts, Fahrner has succeeded in
dramatizing the salient aspects of Stein's purely verbal play. While
the blotches may refer to the indescribable characters in "Parlor,"
it would seem that the microwriting, in addition to its

<b></b>

structural function, represents the unreported conversations taking place
in the Earle sisters' parlor and the nuns' "parloir," and even the funeral
parlor where his daughters transported Mr. Earle. And the Earle sisters
may even have joined their dad: "The Earle sisters have now been forgotten
just as a memory" ("P," 328). In this manner, Fahrner has succeeded in
concretizing Stein's technique of compounding and collapsing persons and
places. The artist faithfully copies Stein's self-referential text while
repeating throughout the mute utterances of the characters. Similarly,
the artist's porous enclosures combine distance and separation with
close encounters in a room. Like Stein, who implies that the Earles
may not have a parlor or even a house but only a vacant lot, Fahrner by
means of her open-ended spaces suggests that the Earles may not have a
residence of their own. And like the author, the artist equates there
with nowhere and all over as well as proximity with distance.
<p>
Fahrner conveys Stein's negativity by means of emptiness. For instance,
the porous enclosures contain no more than other lines and shapes
repeating one another from page to page. As in the text, repetition
appears everywhere in the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Fahrner has inscribed
her and Stein's name some six times on the first and last pages as
well as on the title page and the cover. The artist has matched the
author's playful sonorities by a harmonious succession of colored shapes
and enclosures. And by elongating the grid, she has captured the very
movement of Stein's writing. Indeed, a paradoxical sense of continuity
marks the text and the graphics, both of them rich in non-sequiturs.
<p>
As had all image makers since the invention of the codex and until Sonia
Delaunay's and Blaise Cendrars' <i>La Prose du Transsib&eacute;rien et
de la petite Jehane de France</i>, Hurd sought to enhance reading by
providing plausible representations of some of the events and people
described.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
We usually judge these representational graphics in terms of their
fidelity to the text and their artistic interest which, in some
cases, notably the Curmer edition of <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, whose
illustrators transformed Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's sentimental tale
into a masterpiece.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Abstract and minimal graphics have a far different effect on
readers. Indeed, abstract paintings&#8212; grids&#8212;erect, as Rosalind
Krauss states, a wall between art and language.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Nonetheless, many abstractionists and even minimalists have
contributed graphic accompaniments to texts, usually to the poetry
they admired. Rather than representations or commentaries on the text,
these graphics by disorienting at first readers and viewers tend to
increase their awareness. By challenging our understanding, these
abstract images induce us to decipher not only the images themselves
but also to question the text. We thus must confront juxtaposed and
equally hermetic signifiers. And bookwork compounds this situation
insofar as both the graphics and the text play subordinate parts in an
emerging structure as Fahrner in her mise en sc&egrave;ne, Sharoff in
her systematic displacements, and Blank in her radical reduction have
shown. By combining abstraction with representation, Weil has succeeded
in enhancing our appreciation of Stein's text without reducing its
hermeticism. This purposefully elaborated structure requires increased
participation and even collaboration on the part of the reader in the
creating of a new and complex art form.

<b></b>

<p>
As a rule, artists, mimetic or other, give close readings of the
texts they illustrate and thus have much in common with critics
and translators. Literary critics can glean invaluable information
by comparing the poem they wish to explicate to a translation. The
displacements and substitutions they uncover in the translation can lead
to surprising discoveries in the original. Graphic accompaniments can
lead to new (mis)understandings in much the same way as translations
for they thrive even more than verbal translation on substitutions
and displacements while proposing, if not an equivalence, at least
a meaningful dialogue between verbal and visual signifiers. While
abundant mimetic illustrations such as those of nineteenth-century
novels prevail upon readers to adopt the point of view of the artists,
modern and postmodern graphic commentaries tend to problematize the text
and thus to complicate rather than impose an interpretation.
<p>
By stressing the playfulness and astute childishness of <i>The World
is Round</i> for the benefit of young readers, Clement Hurd highlights
features only vaguely perceived in Stein's books for grownups, for
instance in the frequently humorous <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. The
geometrical precision and impressive craftsmanship of Vincent Fitzgerald's
and Susan Weil's <i>Tender Buttons</i> contrasts with the apparently
haphazard associations and puzzling syntax of Gertrude Stein's poems. By
suggesting that some hidden order underlies the texts, this "livre
de peintre" encourages a new approach modeled on Weil's systematic
displacements and exchanges of fragments which seemingly correspond to
recurrent transformations in Stein's text. Tyson's cruelly incisive lines
point to the underlying horrors of war in Stein's apparently mild war
poems while Nemours' minimalist colors and the three different printings
of the text focus the reader's attention on the divisions and separations
featured in "Early and Late." Irma Blank's radical abridgement of the
text and her wordless cursive writing radically distance themselves from
the voluble <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. The sharp contrast between
<i>No Words</i> and <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> suggests that Stein
may have proceeded by increments without any thought of eliminating
anything whatsoever. Stein, indeed, deliberately delays completed
meaning and thus pleasurably induces the reader to discover the path
through a plethora of words. Sharoff's complex treatment of "Procession"
attracts our attention to Stein's displaced syntax which serves to bring
the world simultaneously closer and more distant. And Fahrner induces
us to see "Parlor" as a fully-fledged play performed in a theater thus
conforming to Stein's statement in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>: ". . . whenever I write a play it is a play because it is a thing I do not
see but it is a thing somebody can see that is what makes a play for me."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
It would thus appear that visual readings can produce the same sort
of effects as critical commentaries while adding to the pleasures of
reading by means of inventive bookwork.

Stein wrote a particularly compelling prose poem about Lascaux,

Stein had commissioned Rose, an old friend whose paintings she regularly
bought, to adorn <i>The World is Round</i>. She had devoted three short
texts to this painter, republished in <i>ROTAB</i>, 56 and 60.

In <i>The World is Not Flat</i> which accompanies the Arion Press Edition
of <i>The World is Round</i>, Clement Hurd's wife, Edith, clearly explains
the transformation from one edition to the next. Gertrude Stein, <i>The

Gertrude Stein, "Une pi&egrave;ce circulaire," traduit et
pr&eacute;fac&eacute; par G&eacute;rard-Georges Lemaire (Paris: Edition
Traversi&egrave;re, 1985), illustrations by Arthur Aeschbacher, Albert
Ayme, Brion Gysin, Jiri Kolar, Tom Phillips. "A Circular Play" can be
found in <i>Last Operas and Plays</i>, ed. Carl Van Vechten (New York:
Rinehart, 1949).
<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
As its title indicates, "A Circular Play" emphasizes rotundity no less
than <i>The World is Round</i>. One of Kolar's illustrations consists
of a printed paper apple described by Martine Saillard, the publisher,
as "t&ecirc;te de mots" [head of words] and "pomme de lettres" [apple
of letters]. The preferred copies provide a shaped paper apple whose
sphericity rivals Hoyem's inflated balloon. For further discussion,
see Hubert, "Gertrude Stein: Cubism and the Postmodern Book."

<p>
<a name="FOOT13" href="#REF13">13</a>.
In <i>Women of the Left Bank,</i> Shari Benstock states: "In Tender
Buttons, Stein creates a woman's world; she renames and thereby reacquires
the objects that surround her, including Alice Toklas, who has now become
an object (of love) in this homemade universe." Benstock, <i>Women of the
Left Bank. Paris, 1900-1940</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986),
162. Jayne L. Walker has also stressed the feminine aspects of Tender
Buttons in <i>The Making of a Modernist: Gertrude Stein from Three Lives
to Tender Buttons</i> (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1976),
127ff. Henceforth abbreviated as <i>MOAM</i>. See also Lyn Hejinian,

For a theoretical discussion of minimalist and abstract art, see
W. J. T. Mitchell, <i>Picture Theory</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1994), especially Chapter 7, "<i>Ut Pictoria Theoria</i>: Abstract
Painting and Language," 209-33. Illustration by means of minimal or
abstract graphics further complicates their relationship with language. We
have tried to bypass the issue by stressing the idea of performance.
