Few would consider today's London Underground one of the
Seven Wonders of
the
World, but that is how it was appraised by a Danish
architect in
1935.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
He was not alone in his admiration for a transport
system
that was widely seen as efficient in its operation,
progressive in its
treatment
of employees, and--perhaps most notable of all--boldly
modernist in its
corporate
appearance, from the architecture of its buildings to the
design of its
wastebins. During the interwar period the London Underground
was praised
for its
patronage of modern artists, architects, and designers, as
well as for
introducing modern art to a wide public. "The art galleries
of the
People," wrote
the art critic for the London <I>Sunday Times, </I>"are not
in Bond
Street, but
are to be found in every [Underground] station."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
And when the
renovated Piccadilly Circus station was reopened in 1928,
one reporter
declared
that it had been "utterly transformed by modern architecture
and modern
art into
a scene that would make the perfect setting for the finale
of an opera."
(. <a href=2.1saler_1.html>1</a>
and <a href=2.1saler_2.html>2</a>)
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
"Opera" is an apposite term. During the interwar period the
London
Underground
was consciously designed to be a Wagnerian
<I>Gesamtkunstwerk, </I>a union
of the
arts that would consolidate a public divided by
industrialism and
materialism,
and provide a new source of spirituality in an increasingly
secular age.
Frank
Pick, the executive officer of the Underground who initiated
and directed
the
Underground's design and publicity, certainly admired
Wagner. Even more
than
Wagner, 

<B></B>

 however, Pick admired the two
nineteenth-century English
proponents of
the integration of art and life, John Ruskin and William
Morris. Selected
elements of Ruskin and Morris's social and aesthetic ideals
inspired Pick
to
transform the Underground into a work of public art. Indeed,
the
Underground of
the interwar period should be considered as the culminating
project of the
nineteenth-century English arts and crafts movement, a union
of the arts
designed
for the pleasure and the use of the common individual. Pick
intended the
transport system to match Morris's description of art as "a
joy to the
maker and
the user," and this was an apt description for the
Underground during the
interwar period.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Pick's achievement poses far-reaching questions for what has
come to be
one of
the most widely accepted paradigms in discussing modernism
and the
avant-garde,
Peter B&uuml;rger's distinction between a formalist and
autotelic
"modernism" and
a socially engaged "avant-garde" that opposed it during the
early twentieth
century. For B&uuml;rger, the distinctive feature of the
avant-garde was
its
critical practice in which "art was not to be simply
destroyed, but
transferred
to the praxis of life where it would be preserved, albeit in
changed
form."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Implicit within this argument is the notion that the
avant-garde, in its aim to 

<B></B>

 change
bourgeois society and culture, must
exist in
tense opposition to the prevailing cultural milieu, and will
express this
opposition in provocative, if not overtly shocking,
ways--B&uuml;rger
cites the
infamous <I>Fountain by R. Mutt </I>created by Marcel
Duchamp in 1917 as a
representative avant-garde "work." The efforts of Pick and
his numerous
associates discussed in this essay corresponded to similar
attempts by
contemporaneous avant-garde movements on the Continent such
as the Berlin
Dadaists, French Surrealists, Russian Constructivists, and
Italian
Futurists to
challenge autotelic conceptions of art.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
The most successful
embodiment of the interwar avant-garde's aim to reintegrate
art with
everyday
life (including "mass culture") was not Duchamp's ironic and
provocative
reinscription of a ready-made urinal into an "artwork," but
in fact the
"Earthly
Paradise" of the London Underground during the 1920s and
1930s. What a
transport
system might contribute to current debates about modernism
and the
avant-garde is
one subject of this essay.

<p>
The second aim of this essay is to explore modernism's
relationship with
the
past. Certainly there were modernists who broke with the
past in their
quest to
create new cultural forms that would capture the seemingly
unique
experience of
modernity. But there were also those who perceived
connections 

<B></B>

 between the
present and the past, such as Walter Benjamin, or who sought
to
reinvigorate
earlier traditions as a way to negotiate the present, such
as Ezra
Pound.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Such "usable pasts" tended to be mythopoeic
constructions of
organic communities either far removed temporally (classical
Greece and
Rome) or
spatially, situated in the "non-West" (Africa, Asia, etc.)
Pick's
indebtedness to
Ruskin and Morris points to modernism's link to a past often
considered
antithetical to it: medievalism. The story of the artistic
Underground also
illuminates this connection.

<p>
Indeed, it draws our attention to the continuing--and
surprising--influence of
Ruskin and Morris on social and aesthetic questions during
the early
twentieth
century. It is usually thought that the arts and crafts
movement faded
into a
feeble antiquarianism after Morris's death in 1896. Morris's
craft revival
was
intended to restore a common art "by the people and for the
people," but
the
elegant handicrafts he and his followers created were simply
too expensive
for
most consumers. In addition to the decline of the movement,
Ruskin and
Morris's
aesthetic theories, which stressed the moral and social
utility of art,
seemed to
be replaced in the early decades of this century by the
modernist
aesthetic of
Roger Fry and Clive Bell. This aesthetic stressed art's
autonomy;
according to
Fry and Bell, art was concerned with its own formal
properties rather than
with
its representative content. A work of art was to be judged
solely on its
"Significant Form," which elicited "aesthetic emotions" from
sensitive
viewers.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
This aesthetic formalism became the dominant way of
understanding cultural modernism through the 1960s.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
While the
definition of cultural modernism has become more complex in
recent years,
it is
still frequently defined as autonomous and self-reflexive,
concerned with
its own
formal properties at the expense of any wider social
meaning.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
This definition of cultural modernism as formalist has led
us to obscure
the
influence that Ruskin and Morris have had on the reception
of modern art
during
the interwar period. The example of Pick and the Underground
reveals that
their
aesthetic ideals continued to circulate in twentieth-century
England, and
not
just as an Underground movement. Pick was a prominent member
of a wide
network of
businessmen, artists, critics, educators, journalists and
government
officials
who attempted to adapt nineteenth-century romantic
medievalism to the
industrial
and social realities of the early twentieth century. I have
called these
individuals "medieval modernists," following the Minister of
Health, Arthur
Greenwood, when he expressed his admiration for the modern
design of the
new
Underground Headquarters to a reporter in 1931: "The
nineteenth century was
adaptable economically but not spiritually. Now we are
catching up and [I
am]
trying to be a medieval modern."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By the 1930s the arts and crafts' dream of effacing the
distinction
between "fine
art" and "craft" (or "industrial art") had been attained, at
least
discursively--although comparatively few artists were
actually hired by
industries during the interwar period. But the hopes of Pick
and his fellow
medieval modernists to eradicate this semantic distinction,
as well as to
integrate modern art with modern life, collapsed rapidly
after
1939.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
However, if the London Underground proved not to be a
"Joy 

<B></B>

For Ever," for a brief period it was the most successful
manifestation of
an
avant-garde attempt to unite art and life, elite and mass
culture, high
modernism
and romantic medievalism.

<p>
Frank Pick and most of his fellow medieval modernists were
born in the
last third
of the nineteenth century. Many were weaned on the writings
of romantic
medievalists, particularly those of Ruskin and Morris. The
two men were
among the
most prominent of the Victorian thinkers who extolled the
Middle Ages as a
period
of organic and spiritual unity, in which art had been
integrated into
everyday
life. Damning the terminological distinction between the
so-called fine
arts and
the crafts that had been established in the Renaissance,
they urged a
return to
the medieval conception of art as simply skill or craft, the
creation by
the
common person of an artifact rightly made for its purpose.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
This
definition of art had been revived early in the nineteenth
century by the
romantic medievalist and neo-Gothic architect A. W. N.
Pugin, who wrote in
1836
that "the great test of architectural beauty is the fitness
of the design
to the
purpose for which it was intended."
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Ruskin and Morris both
accepted
and expounded upon this concept in their lectures and
published writings.
While
the two hoped to restore the socially and spiritually
integrated world
that had
supposedly existed in the Middle Ages, they did not believe
such a
community was
possible under industrial capitalism, which alienated
individuals from
each other
and from the products of their labor. As they grew older,
Ruskin and Morris
became increasingly disillusioned about the prospects for
genuine social
and
aesthetic change within their own lifetimes, but their
youthful ideal of
reintegrating art and life continued to be pursued by
others.

<p>
In the late nineteenth century there were two attempts to
integrate art
with
everyday life: the first by the followers of Ruskin and
Morris, and the
second by
the government. While Ruskin and Morris came to believe that
industrial
capitalism could not be reformed, a number of their
followers in the arts
and
crafts movement felt that industrial society could be
aestheticized and the
competitive and destructive aspects of capitalism mitigated
through the
introduction of artists into contemporary industries. J. R.
Sedding, Halsey
Ricardo, Walter Crane, and W. R. Lethaby, for example,
continued to
believe in
the social, aesthetic, and economic improvement of society
through the
integration of art and industry. At the 1888 conference of
the Art Workers'
Guild, Sedding went well beyond calling for a Morris chair
in every home,
to
calling for a William Morris in every factory: "Fancy what a
year of grace
it
were for England, if our industries were placed under the
guidance of 'one
vast
Morris'! Fancy a Morris installed in every factory. . . .
The battle of the
industries were <I>[sic] </I>half won!"
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
The government attempted to integrate art with industry in
the nineteenth
century
primarily to improve the quality of British goods for export
markets. But
there
was a fundamental difference between the aims of the
government and the
aims of
the arts and crafts movement. Members of the latter wanted
to break down
the
hierarchical distinction that elevated the fine artist over
the designer
for the
moral reason 

<B></B>

 that such a distinction
was class-based rather than natural,
and for
the very practical reason that few "fine artists" would
design for
industry if
being designated a designer meant a diminution of their
status. The
government,
in contrast, reinforced the distinction between fine artists
and designers
by
directing its industrial-art instruction and facilities
toward the
training of
artisans rather than artists. Both the Royal College of Art
and the
Victoria and
Albert Museum had originally been established to train
artisans to "apply"
art to
industry: in effect, to slap curlicues, angel's wings, or
other stock
forms onto
industrial products. Industries tended to be unimpressed by
designers
trained in
this fashion, and found it less expensive to copy popular
patterns from the
Continent themselves. Most industrialists, in fact, remained
indifferent
to the
whole issue of industrial design, complacently assuming that
assured sales
within
the Empire would maintain their profits.

<p>
At the turn of the century, many of Ruskin and Morris's
followers warned
against
such complacency, and contested the government's ineffective
program by
attaining
influential positions at the Royal College of Art, London's
Central School
of
Arts and Crafts, provincial arts schools, and important
governmental
positions,
notably within the Boards of Trade and Education. They
cautioned against
the
economic threat posed by Germany, which had embarked on an
ambitious
industrial
design-campaign inspired, ironically, by the English arts
and crafts
movement. In
1907, for example, its German admirers established the
Deutsche Werkbund to
coordinate the efforts of artists, industrialists,
educators, and the
government
in improving industrial product design. In England, however,
little had
been done
in those areas; one English design reformer recalled in
frustration that
"We
changed not only the face but the direction of German
industry. And in all
those
pre-war years those of us who were interested could make
very much less
impression on British industry."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
Two factors, however, led to a rapid reconceptualization of
the scope and
function of art and the artist in England during the
interwar years. The
first
was Roger Fry and Clive Bell's redefinition of art as design
in the years
immediately before the war; the second was the increased
attention devoted
to the
issue of art and industry triggered by the war itself. Both
Fry and Bell's
new
aesthetic of "Significant Form" that emerged between 1910
and 1914 and the
renewed focus on the economic issue of art and industry
promoted the idea
that
the conventional separation between art and craft, fine art
and objects of
everyday use, could be overcome through the replacement of
the term "art"
with
"design." This reconceptualization was widely supported by
artists,
educators,
government officials, critics, and design reformers during
the 1920s and
1930s.
By 1934, the art critic Anthony Bertram could state that
"the recent
extension of
the word 'design' is one of the most interesting and
significant
indications of
the whole trend of good modern thought. It is fast becoming
one of the most
inclusive words in the vocabulary."
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Fry vigorously promoted this redefinition of art as "design"
through the
two
postimpressionist exhibitions he had organized in London in
1910 and 1912,
as
well as through a series of lectures and essays. These,
together with his
friend
Clive Bell's influential <I>Art </I>, argued that
design was the
element
common to all aesthetic 

<B></B>

 artifacts, be
they painting or pots. The two men
abolished the hierarchical distinction between a work of art
and a work of
craft;
art and design, in their aesthetic, became synonymous.

<p>
While Fry and Bell agreed with Morris's contention that the
distinction
between
art and craft was false, neither agreed with Morris's belief
that all
genuine art
was also useful--indeed, Fry and Bell were reacting against
this
conception of
art, which they associated with the moral and utilitarian
aesthetic of the
Victorians.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Both men were uninterested in looking at machine
products as potential works of art. Nevertheless, their
redefinition of
art as
design contributed to the effacement of the distinction
between fine art
and
industrial art in the interwar period. The 1910
postimpressionist
exhibition had
been a <I>succ&egrave;s de scandale, </I>but as is often the
case with
avant-garde movements, the succeeding exhibition in 1912 was
a
<I>succ&egrave;s
d'estime. </I>As a result, "fine artists" who eked out an
existence
painting and
sculpting became more willing to identify themselves as
designers, as this
term
no longer implied a derogation of their artistic status.
Painters and
sculptors
could conceivably be integrated into most English industries
with a
minimum of
specialized training, as these industries were craft-based
rather than
highly
technical in nature: the design of furniture, pottery,
hosiery, jewelry,
and
textiles did not require extensive training, and offered
artists
much-needed
income during the economic crises of the interwar period.

<p>
This redefinition of art as design, and the artist as
designer, was rapidly
assimilated into public discussions about art. In 1932
<I>The Listener
</I>marveled that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We have artists of the stature of Henry Moore, Vanessa Bell,
and John Nash
turning quite naturally from painting a picture or carving a
statue to
designing
a lampstand or a wall-paper or a book cover. And we have Mr.
Roger Fry's
word for
it . . . that these are but representative of a great number
of sensitive
and
gifted artists.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Fry and Bell's new aesthetic vocabulary appealed to those
who were
searching for
a way to comprehend the often bewildering expressions of
modernism. It
provided
educators, for example, with a new lexicon to explain art
forms that were
radically different from the Victorian's narrative art.
Their
effectiveness in
explaining the new art in the new terms that emphasized form
and design
over
content can be seen in the shift in attitudes toward modern
art and
children's
art. In 1910 modern art was often derisively compared to the
scribbles of
children,
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
whereas by the 1930s children's art was often being
praised for its likeness to modern art. Reflecting on this
transition, a
member
of the Local Education Authority in Kent noted in 1935 that
"the emphasis
is
changing in the teaching of art in schools from
representational technique
to an
attempt to get children to sum up the essential character of
an object. .
. . A
good deal of attention is paid to colour, composition, and
design."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The second factor contributing to the interwar redefinition
of art as
design was
the new economic significance accorded to industrial art
during and after
the
First World War. If "design" was given a more inclusive
meaning as a
result of
Fry and Bell's new aesthetic, it was elevated to an issue of
national
importance
due to the economic pressures engendered by the war. The
drain on overseas
investments and 

<B></B>

 loss of export
revenues caused by the conflict meant that
exports
would have to play an even greater role than usual in the
postwar recovery.
"Industrial art" and "design" thus became associated with
patriotism:
improving
English design was seen as a way to combat Germany on the
economic front,
as well
as to reclaim the English origins of the industrial design
movement from
the
pilfering Hun. During the war, the Board of Trade set up the
British
Institute
for Industrial Art to encourage the improvement of
industrial design. This
was
welcomed by the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum,
Sir Cecil
Smith, who
noted that "the very terminology of to-day which
discriminates between
'Fine
Art'. . . and 'Decorative' or 'Industrial' art, is an
unfortunate misnomer
of
purely modern origin."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The Board of Education, too,
considered the
integration of art and industry a national priority. Its
president
appointed
William Rothenstein, a painter and vocal advocate of Ruskin
and Morris's
social
aesthetic, to head the Royal College of Art in 1920, with
the aim of
training
artists to be industrial designers. Rothenstein hired the
painter Paul
Nash to
teach in the RCA's Design School, and his policy of
integrating fine- and
industrial-art training was supported by the Board of
Education through
the early
1930s.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
And in 1919 the Ministry of Reconstruction published a
pamphlet, "Art and Industry," that appeared to make the
views of Ruskin and
Morris into national policy: "Art is generally understood to
be a thing
apart. It
is 'applied' or 'fine' (two of the most ignorant and
misleading terms ever
invented) according as it is useful or not. We must work for
the
restoration of
the broader meaning of art--one and indivisible in its
association with
life and
work."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
During and after the First World War, therefore, art and
artists were
assigned an
important social role, challenging the romantic image of the
artist as
outsider.
Arguing for the social function of the modern artist as a
designer for
industry,
Paul Nash noted that "the economic problem of the artist
today is
distinctly
precarious, [but] it may be possible to regard the artist in
a new light,
that of
a member of the community."
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Nash frequently described
himself as a
"designer" rather than as a painter or "fine artist," and
argued
vigorously for
the integration of art and life in <I>Room and Book
</I>. In a 1933
letter
to the <I>Times, </I>he predicted that the term "fine
artist" would soon
disappear entirely: "the professional artist of the future
would be a
professional designer."
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
And while Wyndham Lewis differed
from most
medieval modernists in his elitist and antidemocratic views,
he too argued
for
the unity and social function of the arts. In this he seems
to have been
influenced by Pick's associate W. R. Lethaby, a fervent
disciple of Ruskin
and
Morris, as well as one of the earliest proponents in England
of modern
architecture and industrial design.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
In <I>The Caliph's Design
</I> Lewis asked, "Why does not the Architect . . .
--why does not
this
strange absentee, this shadow, this Ghost of the great
Trinity, Sculpture,
Painting, and Architecture--for which I have substituted
Design . . .
<I>why does
he not cheer us up by Building a New Arena?</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Thus while
Fry and
Bell had used "design" to disassociate the function, form,
and content of
art
from everyday life, many artists used the term to reaffirm
art's social
function,
undermining aesthetic formalism with its own terms. 

<B></B>

<p>
Art teachers, no less than artists, supported the
redefinition of art.
Many were
lower-middle-class women who were poorly paid, undervalued,
and
overworked; the
integration of the arts offered their profession an enhanced
social
status. They
would contribute to the aestheticization of everyday life
and to the
creation of
well-designed commodities through educating the public. It
was crucial,
they
felt, to counter the disparaging comments that many critics
had initially
leveled
against the new art. The postimpressionist artists had been
attacked in
1910 for
rejecting the polished technique of the Academy, but
educators saw the
apparent
lack of technique in a positive light: the new art could be
produced by
ordinary
individuals as it had been in the Middle Ages, rather than
restricted to
academically trained "fine artists." It was precisely the
seemingly
spontaneous
and informal qualities of the new art that encouraged
educators to promote
postimpressionism as the new mass art for the new mass age.
In 1928 H. J.
R.
Murray, an Inspector of Schools, underscored this
egalitarian shift in
attitude
toward art education: "It has become orthodox to believe
that drawing is a
natural form of expression or language and as such is the
heritage of every
child. In other words drawing is not an accomplishment to be
permitted to a
talented few, but an integral and necessary part of any
complete system of
education."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
Art was no longer understood to be either a minor subject,
rapidly
forgotten
after primary school, or one associated with middle-class
dilettantism.
Art was
now depicted as a discipline crucial to the moral,
spiritual, and economic
welfare of the nation. Through art education, teachers would
elevate their
charges' sensibilities, thereby forming discriminating
consumers who would
in
turn demand well-designed articles from recalcitrant
manufacturers. At the
1928
International Congress for Art Education, teachers stressed
that the
public must
receive such training in order to render the modern world of
commerce and
industry humane: "Many of the amenities of life have been
lost during the
transition from hand to machine production and can only be
regained by the
control of industry by an aesthetically educated public
opinion."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
The public need not consist of passive consumers of goods
manipulatively
retailed
by the "Culture Industry," as certain Frankfurt School
theorists
maintained at
this time. Instead, the public would have a significant
voice in the
creation of
culture through the power of purchase: consumption could be
equated with
production.

<p>
Government committees, charged with investigating how
Britain's industrial
art
could be improved, and frustrated with the reluctance both
of industries
to hire
trained designers and local authorities to provide effective
training in
industrial design, accepted the educators' arguments. As one
government
committee
concluded, "education in appreciation of industrial
aesthetics must be
carried on
before there is to be any perceptible upward trend in the
quality of
British
industrial design."
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
In 1937 the Board of Education revised
their
<I>Handbook of Suggestions for Teachers in Elementary
Schools </I>by
combining
the two separate chapters on "Drawing" and "Handwork" of the
1927 edition
into a
single chapter on "Art and Craft." The new handbook stated
that "Art and
Handicraft are not two separate sections of the curriculum
which imply
different
outlooks: they should properly be regarded as part and
parcel of one
important
branch of teaching."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
The interwar redefinition of art as "design" was furthered
by the
intercession of
numerous groups of art enthusiasts and design reformers who
arose to
educate the
public about art's social relevance. Among these groups were
the British
Institute for Industrial Art, the Contemporary Art
Association, the Allied
Artists Association, the Imperial Arts League, the Arts
League of Service,
the
Society of Industrial Artists, the British Institute for
Adult Education,
and the
most influential, the Design and Industries Association
(DIA), formed in
1915.
Modeled on the Deutsche Werkbund, the DIA consisted of
prominent artists,
businessmen, critics, and educators dedicated to instructing
the public
about the
economic and moral utility of art. Through the writings and
activities of
many of
its members, the DIA consciously set out to make the
romantic-medieval
ideals of
Ruskin and Morris applicable to modern industry and art.
While its
membership was
small, many of the DIA's aims and beliefs were frequently
reiterated by
medieval
modernists in education, journalism, government, industry,
and the
artworld. Not
all members of the DIA appreciated modern art, but there
were many, like
Frank
Pick or the art critic Herbert Read, who interpreted visual
modernism as
the new
"living art" that expressed the spirit of the modern age,
the very art that
Morris had eagerly anticipated in his writings but did not
live to see. As
Read
argued in 1934, "Morris, for his day, was as extreme as any
modern artist
. . . .
Morris to-day would be by the side of Le Corbusier in
architecture,
Picasso in
painting, and probably Stalin in politics. The spirit of the
man was
fundamentally revolutionary."
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
While DIA members thought of themselves as the genuine heirs
of Ruskin and
Morris, they rejected their forerunners' pessimism about
industrialization.
Disillusion with commerce and industry had led Ruskin to
reactionary social
views, and Morris to revolutionary ones, but DIA members,
many of whom
came from
industrial towns in the north, learned to stop worrying and
love the
machine. The
increasing collectivization of society and the apparent
mastery of men over
technics in the early decades of the twentieth century
suggested that an
organic
and spiritual community might be established along meliorist
rather than
revolutionary lines. The machine was, in their view, just
the latest
version of
an artisanal tool, and if artists could master it, then
Morris's Earthly
Paradise
could be attained. Like many of the DIA's views, this
redefinition of the
machine
was shared by those who were not formally members of the
organization: for
example, in his introduction to an edition of Morris's
writings, G. D. H.
Cole
noted that Morris had been "blind, for the most part, to the
pleasure
which a man
can take in a machine that he helps to do its intricate work
well . . . .
There
is no fixed line between the spheres of handicraft and
machinework."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
The compatibility between handicraft and machinework,
formalism and
functionalism
was furthered through the revival of the nineteenth-century
romantic-medieval
definition of art as expressing "Fitness for Purpose." The
DIA adopted
this as
their motto and promoted it so zealously that even the
Prince of Wales
invoked it
as art's defining characteristic in the early 1930s.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Pick and
others combined this romantic-medieval aesthetic with the
modernist
aesthetic of
Significant Form, thereby 

<B></B>

 enabling
them to acknowledge the formal
properties of
the new art while still grounding postimpressionist art
within Victorian
social
and utilitarian parameters.

<p>
"Fitness for Purpose" thus had the advantage of situating
the new and
bewildering
artistic styles within a very English context, in contrast
to the
apparently
"French" aestheticism of Fry and his friends. One founding
member of the
DIA
criticized the Bloomsbury aesthetic as elitist in both
content and
expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A proper function of criticism should be to foster our
national arts and
not to
frighten people off with high-pitched definitions and
far-fetched
metaphors mixed
with a flood of (as Morris said) "sham technical twaddle."
It is a pity to
make a
mystery of what should most easily be understood. There is
nothing occult
about
the thought that all     things may be made well
or made ill.
A work
of ar is a well-made thing, that is all.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Whereas Fry and Bell tended to describe art in abstract
aesthetic terms,
referring to a work's "plastic rhythms" and "contrapuntal
formal
harmonies," the
DIA and their followers discussed art in more practical
terms, pointing to
the
fact that the geometrical forms of cubism were especially
suited to the
requirements of machine production, or that the simple, flat
images and
strong
primary colors of a Matisse were especially fit for the
purposes of
advertising
posters, which needed to create an instant impression on
commuters.
"Fitness for
Purpose" provided a normative and practical measure by which
the new art
could be
evaluated, and this was part of the slogan's wide appeal.
Harry Peach, a
DIA
member and close friend of Pick's, thought the slogan should
be mentioned
as
often as possible in DIA publicity "as the public could
understand [it],
and we
are all asking for some test on which to judge things by."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
"Fitness for Purpose" was also reassuring to those who
feared that modern
art
represented a radical subjectivism and self-indulgence that
threatened the
Protestant work ethic, and would lead to a breakdown of
communal standards
and to
cultural anarchy.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
In a generally favorable review of the
avant-garde group <I>Unit One, </I>the architect
Goodhart-Rendel
articulated a
common sentiment when he cautioned that "The artist that
keeps his art
only as a
partner in his self-expression condemns it to the
infertility of a harlot.
The
expression of his precious self should never be his object,
it should be
the
least conscious part of his labour in some definite task."
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
But
"Fitness for Purpose" contained the new art within the
earlier Victorian
rhetoric
of duty, service, and responsibility. By linking modern art
with Fitness
for
Purpose and industrial production, visual modernism was made
to appear less
anarchic, subjective, and alienating, and more
comprehensible, moral, and
socially beneficial. Medieval modernists maintained that
once artists were
integrated into industry and obeyed the mandate of "Fitness
for Purpose,"
they
would be working for the benefit of the community as artists
had done in
the
Middle Ages, rather than jeopardizing the commonweal by
brashly
celebrating their
own egoism.

<p>
In addition to adapting the aesthetic of Significant Form to
the aesthetic
of
Fitness for Purpose, the DIA attempted to reconcile other
fundamental
tenets of
the arts and crafts tradition with the modern industrial
world. This took
some
imaginative 

<B></B>

 reworking of Ruskin and
Morris's writings, but DIA members and
their
fellow medieval modernists had proven themselves equal to
the challenge by
redefining machines as the modern equivalent of artisanal
tools. Still,
some
concepts proved harder to adapt than others. For example,
the DIA took
Ruskin's
famous emphasis on "Joy in Labor," which he believed
pertained to the
experience
of medieval artisans but not to modern factory workers, and
transformed it
to
"Joy in Service." Industrial workers could take pride in the
service they
provided to the community, and such pride would be
sufficient compensation
for
having to work within a system of subdivided labor.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
DIA members and other medieval modernists also argued that
mass-produced
commodities need not be thought of as inferior to
individually crafted
works of
art, as Ruskin and Morris had believed they were. While the
German critic
Walter
Benjamin argued that the aura of art was lost in the age of
mechanical
reproduction, many of his English contemporaries believed
that industrial
products could be imbued with the spirit of the industrial
artist. As
Frank Pick
stated, "We think of ourselves as vessels of the spirit of
God, so things,
we may
say, are receptacles of the spirit of man. When they are
full of the
spirit,
things have souls--God's gift to us, man's gift to them."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
The new art's spiritual effects were emphasized as often as
its economic
benefits. In its emphasis on abstract qualities such as
form, balance,
composition, and harmonic "rhythms" over the mimetic
representation of the
everyday, postimpressionism seemed to express the eternal
forms underlying
the
transient surface appearances of life. Like medieval
paintings and
stained-glass
windows, the new art called the viewers' attention to the
integrated and
immutable order of the universe, which appeared to have been
lost sight of
in the
fragmented, skeptical, and secular world of the early
twentieth century.
One
writer argued in 1921 that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
However strange and repellent this newer art may appear to
those of us
brought up
in the safe paths of tradition I cannot help welcoming the
new vision as an
indication of the younger generation's demand for a more
ordered and
permanent
aspect of life. The study of modern art has brought to me
the comforting
hope
that the coming generation will understand the meaning of
life and reality
and
will therefore be wiser than     the
generations which brought
Europe to the catastrophe of 1914.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Many of the medieval modernists asserted that the platonic
"forms" and
invisible
"rhythms" expressed by nonrepresentational art were also
being revealed by
contemporary explorations in science. Abstract art seemed to
radiate the
invisible cosmic forces that had been discovered by the new
physics at the
turn
of the century, and to represent the mysterious Fourth
Dimension posited by
late-nineteenth-century non-Euclidian geometry.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Indeed, the
so-called nonrepresentational art of the postimpressionists
could thus be
seen as
mimetic: if, as Ruskin had said, all genuine art must be
true to Nature,
this
modern art was precisely true to the Nature revealed by
modern science.
Herbert
Read spoke for many when he asserted that "Art is a
<I>natural
</I>activity. Its
rules are the proportions and rhythms inherent in our
universe."
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
The Earthly Paradise of the medieval modernists could
embrace commerce and
industry within its ambit, as both would be spiritualized by
the
transcendental
agency of art. Pick, for example, believed that commerce
overshadowed
religion as
the principal bond among people in the modern world, but
that commerce
need not
be incompatible with spiritual principles: "I seek behind
commerce, art
and I
know that behind art there must be good custom. Morality, we
call
it."
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
With modern artists integrated into industry, English
industrial products would be transformed from the cheap and
shoddy to the
cheap
and lovely, the new "common art" for the commercial and
democratic age.
Indeed,
Pick and other medieval modernists believed that by
integrating modern
artists
into industry, England would not only evolve into an Earthly
Paradise, but
an
Earthly Paradise that happened to dominate the world's
export markets
through the
sale of its "soulful" commodities. Morris's utopian <I>Dream
of John Ball
</I>could mesh with the economic Dream of John Bull.

<p>
Medieval modernists also stressed those qualities of the new
art that would
appeal to a country whose iconoclastic Protestant heritage
had long
disparaged
the visual in favor of the verbal. In England, visual
modernism was
frequently
characterized as a puritan art, its pure, simple, and
austere designs
connoting
the eternal realm of the Heavenly Kingdom. Protestant
readers of Clive
Bell's
<I>Art </I>could take reassurance from his assertion that if
art is a
religion,
"it is a religion without a priesthood."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Many of those who
were
instrumental in promoting the new art, such as Frank Pick,
Charles Holden,
Roger
Fry, and Samuel Courtauld, came from nonconformist
backgrounds, with a
substantial number raised in Quaker households. This
convergence of
puritanism
and postimpressionism did not pass unnoticed; the artist C.
R. W.
Nevinson, for
example, observed that "in England, where the seventh
commandment is most
reverenced, many of the greatest lovers of this dehumanized
art were either
Quakers or Methodists by birth, and they were always
suspicious of the
flesh or
any sensuous appeal."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
Region and class, no less than religion, contributed to the
interwar
struggle to
define the new art in primarily formalist or social terms.
Many medieval
modernists were raised in the North, and their attempt to
modify the
aesthetic of
"Significant Form" was related to long-established cultural
tensions
between
North and South.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Northern civic pride reflected both a
celebration
of local avant-gardism in industry and a reaction against
the centralizing
pull
of London.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
It is therefore not surprising that Northerners
would
embrace those cultural forms that challenged the staid
orthodoxy and social
exclusivity of London's Royal Academy, while simultaneously
denying that
art was
autonomous. At the opening of a 1911 modern art exhibit in
Manchester,
Robert
Ross of the Contemporary Art Society reminded his provincial
audience that
modern
art was "either very partially recognized or wholly
unrecognized by
officialism,
particularly London officialism. There is some reason for us
to make our
debut in
Manchester. For what Manchester thinks to-day about a good
many things
besides
art England is apt to think to-morrow, or at least the day
after
to-morrow."
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps the high-water mark of the integration of the arts
during the
interwar
period occurred in 1935, when an exhibition of "Art in
Industry" was held
at the 

<B></B>

Royal Academy. The Royal Academy had been the last bastion
of the "fine
arts."
Their refusal in the nineteenth century to display craftwork
had led to the
formation of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1888.
The 1935
exhibition
marked the belated victory of the arts and crafts project to
recognize
art's
social function, and was celebrated as such. A contemporary
noted that "A
common
interest in good work breaks down all unreal distinctions,
and the
authorities of
the Royal Academy . . . have, in organizing this Exhibition,
broken down
all the
artificial barriers that have hitherto separated the Fine
Arts from the
Industrial Arts."
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The challenge to the hierarchical
distinctions
among the arts was at times taken to extremes: one critic
opined that "the
contemplation of cutlery has never given me a sense of
immortality.
Nevertheless,
I maintain that the difference between a well-designed fork
and
Botticelli's
<I>Primavera </I>is one of degree and not kind."
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
Less extreme
definitions of art as simply a well-made artifact fit for
its purpose were
common, however, as were appreciative references to Ruskin
and Morris. The
architect W. R. Lethaby stated in 1919 that Ruskin's thought
"saturates
this
generation through and through"
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
and Anthony Bertram observed
in
1938 that "it was Morris who took art out of the academies
and brought it
again
into everyday life. . . . [but] it has taken nearly half a
century for
these
ideas to percolate into the ideology of our times."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
But although the traditional definition of art had been
successfully
challenged
in public discourse during the interwar period, the
<I>actual
</I>integration of
art and industry had yet to be realized. In his report on
the state of
industrial
art in England in 1936, Nikolaus Pevsner had to admit that
"things are
extremely
bad. When I say that 90 per cent of British industrial art
is devoid of any
aesthetic merit, I am not exaggerating."
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Most industries
remained
uninterested in design, most local authorities remained
uncertain as to
how to
reform their art schools, the Royal College of Art remained
a producer
primarily
of art teachers rather than trained designers, the Board of
Education
remained
unable to enforce its programmatic recommendations, and the
public
remained much
discussed but little consulted as to its habits of
consumption.

<p>
This discrepancy between ideals and reality can in part be
explained by the
decentralized nature of English industrial art education,
which impeded
comprehensive reform programs, and the continued complacency
of most
industries
toward the issue of industrial art. In addition, the attempt
to integrate
art
with industry was stymied by the conflicting motives of the
design
reformers
themselves: utopian aspirations often clashed with economic
goals. Design
reformers argued that England's economic future depended on
satisfactory
industrial design, but many were less concerned about
elevating export
res
than with diffusing art throughout the country so as to
create the New
Jerusalem.
As chairman of the government's Council of Art and Industry
(CAI) during
the
1930s, Frank Pick was quick to argue that "the industrial
future of the
United
Kingdom must to a large and increasing extent be bound up
with the
development of
design."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
But like most interwar design reformers he wanted
to see
that the "right" types of design were available to the
public--designs not
only
fit for purpose, but that also embodied the transcendental
aura of the
artist and
tapped 

<B></B>

 into national traditions.
Moral judgments, rather than market
research,
governed the evaluation of design. Pick had the CAI
concentrate on
"typical"
English industries like sporting goods, pottery, furniture,
silverwork, and
clothing as a way to "escape, if we can, from what I would
call the
Continental
influences which now seek to pervade certain branches of
industry. I do
not think
we can hope to be successful unless we build up a tradition
for ourselves
and
make our English design of international reputation."
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
This top-down approach contrasted markedly with the more
consumer-oriented
design
profession in America, which used market research methods to
determine
what the
public wanted.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Gordon Russell, a prominent designer of the
period,
expressed the English industrial artist's opposition to this
tactic:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
An American super-stylist stated some time ago that he was
surprised to
find in
England that people talked of aesthetics in connection with
industrial
design:
aesthetics, he said, had nothing to do with it, the only
test was a
beautiful
sales curve shooting upwards. I know there are some knaves
and morons in
industry, but such nonsense presupposes that there is no one
else. . . .
The
problem is a social one, as William Morris saw. Good design
is one aspect
of a
good pattern of life and unless the foundations are sound
the
superstructure will
not last.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
While there were a few English industrialists who shared
this moral
reformist
attitude, many others may have been reluctant to hire
industrial artists
precisely because the English design movement seemed overly
idealistic,
even
quixotic.

<p>
The moral conception of design meant that designers in
interwar England
were
trained as "artists" rather than as technicians familiar
with the
specialized
requirements of designing for particular industries. The
industrial artist
of the
1920s and 1930s was a special type of employee, in the world
of commerce
but not
of it, one who was meant to "civilize" commerce and to
spiritualize
industrial
commodities. While individual designers like Lewis Day or B.
J. Fletcher
did not
think this exalted role was incompatible with a solid
vocational training,
many
others did: the job could be fulfilled only through the
gifts of an artist,
rather than through the narrow training of a technician.
Thus in England
the
"designer" was caught between the cultural demand that he be
an artist and
the
industrial demand that he be a specialist. This tension was
nicely
captured in D.
H. Lawrence's Women in Love , in a conversation
between the art
teacher
Gudrun Brangwen and Loerke, a German sculptor and occasional
industrial
artist:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And do you think then," said
Gudrun, "that
<BR>
art should serve industry?"
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art should interpret
industry, as art once
<BR>
interpreted religion," he said.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The cultural imperative prevailed, impelled by the fact that
those who had
been
raised in the arts and crafts tradition obtained positions
of power within
the
government, education, and industry. In addition, industrial
art derived
its
conceptual foundations from nearly a century's worth of
experience with the
traditional "craft-based" 

<B></B>

 industries,
for which artists could create
designs
without extensive technical training. British industrial
investment
continued to
be focused on these staple industries during the interwar
years, rather
than on
the new light-metal industries being developed at the time.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Thus
discussions on improving the training of designers tended to
focus on how
artists
could learn the technical requirements of such traditional
industries as
textiles, pottery, furniture, clothing, and jewelry. As late
as 1936 Pick
himself
believed that the CAI did not need to investigate
engineering industries,
because
he felt that they did not depend on design for sales in the
way that more
traditional craft-based industries did.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
In the interwar
period,
industrial design as it was practiced in America simply was
not a
conceptual
possibility in England.

<p>
&#009;The London Underground, however, was a concrete
realization of the
integration of art and industry so widely touted in print
but so often
flouted in
life. Pick attempted to turn it into an arts and crafts
project, a
microcosmic
example of what he hoped to do with all of London.

<p>
But while Pick had a moment of success in actualizing this
dream, neither
his
more grandiose goal of reshaping London into an orderly and
harmonious
community
nor the discursive union of the arts that he helped to shape
lasted beyond
the
interwar period. By 1945 a clear separation between "fine
art" and
"industrial
design" was reestablished within public rhetoric, and was
institutionalized
through the creation of the Arts Council on the one hand,
and the Council
of
Industrial Design on the other. Indeed, Pick was not just a
central re
in the
establishment of the medieval modernist conception of art;
he also played
a major
role in its sudden collapse. It is to a more specific
account of his
efforts in
both of these directions that we shall now turn.

<p>
Recent literature has depicted Pick as an idealistic yet
shrewd
businessman who
promoted modern art primarily as an advertising strategy to
increase the
Underground's profits.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
It is true that Pick was concerned
with
maintaining corporate revenues. But like his hero John
Ruskin, he adhered
to the
puritan conception of business as a spiritual calling that
emphasized
service
over profit. He consistently maintained this view, from his
earliest
writings as
a youth in the 1890s, to his speeches as the vice-chairman
of the London
Public
Transportation Board (LPTB) in the 1930s. As he told a
gathering in 1929,
"the
financial results of an undertaking, while of marked
importance I cannot
deny,
certainly in a transport undertaking which performs a public
service, do
not
represent the main purpose of the undertaking."
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
That main
purpose?
As he repeatedly maintained, "We are in being to perform
service and
service and
service."
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
Pick intended the Underground to improve people's
lives.
He used posters to inform commuters of cultural and
educational events of
which
they might otherwise be unaware, turned Underground stations
into
mini-museums of
modern design, and was delighted with statistics that showed
attendance at
museums and zoos increased whenever Underground stations
opened within
their
vicinity.
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
Pick's emphasis on service stemmed from both his Protestant
upbringing and
lower-middle-class background. The son of a tradesman, he
was born in 1878,
raised a Congregationalist, and spent his formative years in
York, which
he felt
could be 

<B></B>

 grasped as a civic community
in a way that London could not. He
would
pursue his lifelong quest for "social solidarity" with York
in mind, just
as he
would defend commerce and industry as "noble" pursuits with
his father in
mind
(provided that such pursuits elevated minds as well as
profits).
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
As
he was to explain in 1916, "The great advantage of business
is not the
pursuit of
profit. The great advantage of business is the pursuit of
art."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
As a youth he avidly read Ruskin and Morris, and remained
for most of his
life a
romantic who believed that the new art expressed the
underlying spirit of
the
modern world. By diffusing modern art among the populace he
hoped to
recreate a
spiritual and organic community such as that which had
supposedly existed
during
the Middle Ages. When he became a leader of one of the
largest
corporations of
the country he tried to realize his vision of an Earthly
Paradise: the
Underground would be a model of aesthetic integration and
communal
service, a
catalyst for a more harmonious London of the future. He
stated in 1926,
"We have
to establish a new social synthesis. We have to make the
conflicting
interests of
the people serve some commonweal. We cannot neglect one
great aid to this,
which
is a city laid out and constructed to embody this end."
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
When he moved to London in 1906 to work for the Underground,
by luck he was
assigned to work directly with the new general manager,
Albert Stanley,
later
Lord Ashfield. Ashfield, who recognized Pick's managerial
abilities, was
only too
happy to exploit his employee's workaholic personality. Pick
rapidly became
Ashfield's second-in-command, overseeing the day-to-day
management of the
system
while Ashfield concentrated on the wider worlds of politics
and finance.
Both men
were mavericks, and Pick was given wide latitude in his
decisions; as far
as
Ashfield was concerned, as long as Pick ensured that the
system ran
smoothly, he
could do what he liked with the Underground's appearance.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>

<p>
Pick began to shape the image of the Underground without any
overall
social plan.
He decided that the Underground ought to have a corporate
identity as a
way to
sell it to the public, but also as a way to identify the
system in the
public's
mind as an integrated entity, a microcosm of the organic
unity he sought in
society. In 1913 he hired the arts and crafts typographer
Edward Johnston
to
design a special typeface for the Underground that would
give a distinctive
visual identity to the system, combining tradition with
modernity. At this
time
Pick also began to commission artists to design posters,
many in the latest
modernist styles. He believed that abstract art was "fit for
the purpose"
of
advertising, since, as mentioned above, it conveyed concepts
more rapidly
than
traditional narrative art. In addition, modern art jolted
jaded city
dwellers out
of their conventional habits of seeing, forcing them to view
the world
afresh
with the innocent eye so valued by the romantics.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>

The Underground posters were instrumental in introducing the
public to
modern
art, and accounts in the press praised Pick for turning the
system into
"the
people's picture-gallery."
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
His audacious experiment proved so
successful in generating favorable publicity that it was
emulated by other
several other institutional undertakings and corporations
such as
Shell-Mex, the
Cunard Liners, the General Post Office, and 

<B></B>

 the Empire Marketing Board
(Pick
himself was commissioned to chair the Poster Subcommittee).
The Underground
posters helped introduce the latest artistic styles to the
provinces as
well as
to those residing in London (. <a
href=2.1saler_3.html>3</a> and
<a href=2.1saler_4.html>4</a>). In 1926 Pick
suggested that
the
Victoria and Albert Museum circulate reproductions of the
posters to
provincial
art schools, where contemporary art was nearly invisible,
and two years
later
officials at the museum noted the venture's success: "The
poster movement
. . .
is so progressive, and the demand for this kind of work in
provincial
Schools is
so great, that a gift of drawings of this nature is greatly
appreciated by
us."
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>

<p>
In the 1920s, Pick was encouraged to think of the
Underground as a
catalyst for
social integration by his colleagues at the Design and
Industries
Association.
Among the DIA members who most influenced Pick was W. R.
Lethaby. In a
series of
lectures published as <I>Form in Civilisation </I>in 1922,
Lethaby called
for a
new architectural style that would capture the spirit of the
modern age
and make
London more visually cohesive. Pick had been thinking along
similar lines
about
the need for an environmental catalyst that would promote
social
integration. In
1923 the 

<B></B>

 Underground received
permission to extend southward, and Pick
decided
that the design of the new stations would meet Lethaby's
call for a
contemporary
school of architecture.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
As the new stations were being built
in
1926, Pick promised an audience that "a new style of
architectural
decoration
will arise" and that it would herald "modern London--modern,
not garbled
classic
or renaissance."
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
The architect Pick chose to design the new style, Charles
Holden, was also
a DIA
member, also from Yorkshire, also a nonconformist, also an
admirer of
Ruskin and
Morris, and who also saw modern art as embodying the new
collective spirit.
Holden designed the stations in the International style that
had been
visible on
the continent in the 1920s but was virtually unknown in
England. He also
commissioned modern sculptures by Henry Moore, Jacob
Epstein, and others
for the
Underground headquarters he designed in 1929. He insisted
that the
sculptors
carve directly onto the stone of the building, rather than
use plaster
casts, as
direct carvings had been the practice in the Middle Ages.
Like other of his
colleagues, Holden overtly compared modernism and
medievalism; for example
he
defended Epstein's controversial 

<B></B>

sculpture Day because it was "alive and
vigorous
like much medieval sculpture and that is what I most value."
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=5 href=2.1saler_5.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.1saler_5t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

Just as they defined modernism in terms of medievalism, Pick
and Holden
consciously adapted the International style to native
traditions. For
example,
Holden's functional architecture contained touches of
ornamentation,
unlike many
of the starker buildings on the continent, as both he and
Pick believed
that this
was part of the English tradition. At least one reviewer
felt Holden had
been
successful; anticipating that some might claim that a
station by Holden "is
un-English," the reviewer countered, "True, its constituent
elements are as
international as concrete and cantilevers, but the spirit in
which they are
assembled is wholly English."
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
Several of Holden's
functionalist
buildings have been likened to English cathedrals; perhaps
the most obvious
example is the Uxbridge station of 1938, which has a
stained-glass window
above
the booking hall (<a href=2.1saler_5.html> 5</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
Holden also designed many of the
buildings' fixtures, thereby fulfilling the arts and crafts
ideal of the
architect as master craftsman who created an integrated work
of art.

<p>
In addition to unifying the Underground's surface
appearance, Pick also
tried to
secure optimal working conditions for its employees.
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
The
Underground was widely praised for its services and its art;
nevertheless,
Pick's
ambitions were not 

<B></B>

 satisfied.
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
He wanted to use the
Underground to
influence the growth and form of London, for in his eyes the
transport
system
determined the shape of the city.
<sup><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
With the creation of the
London
Passenger Transportation Board in 1933, Pick believed he had
at hand the
instrument that would shape the London of the future: the
Board brought
together
ninety-two different transport undertakings within a single
nongovernmental
authority, under public inspection. Ashfield was chairman of
the
seven-member
board, with Pick as vice-chairman and chief executive
officer. They were
charged
with expanding the entire transport system, and given
&#163;40,OOO,OOO to
do it.
Pick also was made chairman of the government's Council on
Art and
Industry,
established in 1934 to promote the integration of the two
areas.

<p>
It is at this juncture that Pick was derailed. He found that
he did not
have as
much autonomy as a member of the Transportation Board as he
had at the
Underground. He had to compromise with the other members of
the board,
which was
itself checked by other public agencies. In addition, Pick's
dreams of
reshaping
London would have required a central planning agency to
coordinate myriad
public
and private interests; such a national agency did not exist
in the 1930s.
Finally, the transport system itself was facing financial
difficulties, as
well
as increased competition for traffic from automobiles.

<p>
It was also at this time that Pick became disenchanted with
modern art.
Initially
he had welcomed it as a spiritual force that would help
integrate the body
public, but over time visual modernism seemed to him
increasingly anarchic
and
individualistic. He had hoped that the artist would
subordinate
self-expression
to the greater good of society by becoming a servant to
industry and
following
the constraints embodied in the Eleventh Commandment of
"Fitness for
Purpose."
The 1936 opening of the Surrealist Exhibition in London had
appalled
Pick--he
thought the art immoral and degenerate. A devout
nonconformist, Pick
perceived
surrealism as the hedonistic glorification of the self
rather than as an
art fit
for a higher purpose. In July 1937 he wrote to a friend, "I
have come to
the
conclusion that practically all modernistic methods are bad
and that we
must go
back a long way and build again on the old foundations. I am
certainly not
going
to encourage modern art anymore myself."
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Pick used his power
as
chairman of the CAI to redefine the industrial designer as a
trained
technician
who serves the dictates of industry rather than as an
independent artist.
He
alienated many former friends, who thought his stance
reactionary, just as
he was
ting with other members of the Transportation Board over
policy. The
activities of the CAI were curtailed with the outbreak of
war in 1939, and
Pick,
disillusioned and deeply depressed, resigned from the
Transportation Board
in
1940. He died in 1941, shortly after giving a talk entitled
"Re-Energizing
Religion."
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
From first to last, Pick's abiding concern had
been to
create a spiritual community.

<p>
The redefinition of industrial design that Pick had helped
to establish in
the
late 1930s was continued by others during and immediately
following the
war. In
the early years of the war the Board of Trade realized that
Americans had
established a 

<B></B>

 technologically
sophisticated industrial design profession
in the
mid-1920s, and that America would be Britain's prime
economic competitor
following the war. The government's committees on industrial
design
reported that
the arts and crafts' ideal of the artist as designer would
have to be
abandoned
in the postwar world. The Weir Committee of 1943, for
example, stated "in
our
view there has been too much emphasis on the words 'art' and
'artists'."
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
As a result of such criticism, the government
established the Council of Industrial Design in 1944. Its
chairman stated
that
"the industrial designer is not expressing an intensely
personal point of
view
like the artist. He is one of a team. He is concerned with
the problems of
producing in quantities goods for use, not individual works
of
art."
<sup><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
Robin Darwin, a member of the council, became
Principal of
the Royal College of Art in 1949, and turned it away from
its interwar
emphasis
on the union of the arts toward a more technologically
oriented training
for the
demands of the new light-metal industries. Born in 1910,
Darwin was no
medieval
modernist. He wrote in 1950, "William Morris's ideas were
all confused
with the
'dignity of labour' and so on . . . I think this whole
attitude is muddle
and
bunk."
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>

<p>
The separation of fine art and industrial design was further
cemented by
the
creation of the Arts Council in 1945, an outgrowth of the
Council for the
Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), established
during the war.
CEMA had
promoted the union of the arts in its exhibitions. When
members of CEMA
began to
draft the Arts Council's charter, they found they could be
exempted from
taxation
under a nineteenth-century act that applied to those
societies that dealt
with
"the Fine Arts exclusively."
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
The secretary of CEMA, Mary
Glasgow,
worked with the Department of Treasury in arriving at a
definition of
"Fine Art"
that included industrial art, because, as she put it, "it
might often be
difficult to draw a line between fine and applied art, a pot
and a
picture."
<sup><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
But treasury officials and the chairman of CEMA,
John
Maynard Keynes, worked out a definition of "Fine Art" that
excluded
industrial
art. Keynes, like his Bloomsbury friend Fry, did not believe
that art
could have
a utilitarian function. In a 1945 letter to the secretary of
CEMA he wrote,
"Indeed, it is only to a modern ear that any doubt could
possibly arise.
In the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries . . . the distinction
between the
Fine Arts
and the Applied Arts was familiar. In short, the expression
'Fine Arts' is
by way
of distinction from the technical arts."
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>

<p>
With the foundings of the Council of Industrial Design for
the supervision
of
utilitarian "industrial design" and the Arts Council for the
supervision of
transcendental "fine art," design and art were cleft once
again: the
former to be
used, the latter to be contemplated. This distinction,
although challenged
within
recent years by the pluralist and antihierarchical thrust of
postmodern
theories,
nevertheless remains a common view today. Indeed, a
controversy erupted
over the
definition of art in January 1989, when the Royal Academy
mounted an
exhibition
of the work of Malcolm McClaren, who designed the image of
the Sex Pistols.
McClaren's work, according to one critic, did not qualify as
"art," but
rather as
"design"--and therefore ought not to be displayed at the RA:
"I would
class Mr.
McClaren as a designer, who creates style, 

<B></B>

 rather than as an artist." But
Frederick Gore, age seventy-five, disagreed: "I am
personally dead against
any
distinction between fine art and all the activities which
are its
fundamental
background and basis. Directly you divorce art from life and
think of art
as a
separate commodity you have met disaster."
<sup><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
Gore reached
adulthood
in the 1930s, and in 1989 he continued to speak medieval
modernese.

<p>
The example of Pick and the Underground shows that the
culminating
achievement of
the arts and crafts movement was not the floral scarves sold
at Liberty's,
but
the London Underground. The story of Pick and the
Underground also reveals
that
visual modernism was commonly understood in terms of the
romantic
medievalism of
Ruskin and Morris. Modernism has been defined in numerous
ways, but often
as
rejecting the past, as seeking to "Make It New." But as we
have seen, the
English
avant-garde tended to be retro-garde. Contemporaries
certainly recognized
this:
in 1933 J. E. Barton told listeners of his six-part series
on modern art
broadcast by the BBC, "Our modern architects, sculptors,
painters and
designers
generally, are often described as'breaking away from
tradition.' It would
be far
more accurate to say that they are trying to get back to
tradition."
<sup><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
Similar ideas can be found among modernists on
the
Continent. Walter Gropius, for example, intended the Bauhaus
to emulate the
medieval workshop traditions in which architecture was seen
as the master
art
uniting all others ("Bauhaus" is derived from
<I>Bauh&uuml;tten, </I>the
medieval
craft lodges for artisans working on the cathedrals).
<sup><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>
But the
attempt to associate modernism with the past may have been
most pronounced
in
England, where the more things change the more they are made
to appear to
remain
the same.

<p>
Finally, what does the example of Pick and his medieval
modern cohorts
contribute
to contemporary debates about the relationship between
modernism and the
avant-garde? The question arises because of the seeming
similarities
between this
story and B&uuml;rger's "historically concrete"
<sup><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
<I>Theory of
the
Avant-Garde. </I>In his influential analysis, B&uuml;rger
distinguishes the
"historical avant-garde" from modernism, which he sees as
the culminating
stage
of art's progressive development toward autonomy, a
development he links
with the
increasing influence of the "bourgeoisie." For B&uuml;rger,
late
nineteenth-century aestheticism, in which a work's content
as well as its
form no
longer referred to the praxis of life, was the necessary
outcome of a
series of
events that had rendered art increasingly autotelic. By the
early twentieth
century, the congruence of the bourgeois definition of art
as autonomous
with
art's formal break with mimesis meant that the bourgeois had
succeeded in
institutionalizing art as autonomous and universal, their
emphasis on the
sensuous aspects of art over the practical a reflection of
their own
relative
"free[dom] from the pressures of the need for survival"
(<I>TAG,</I> 46).
The
"historical avant-garde," such as the Dadaists or
Surrealists, arose to
critique
the bourgeois institution of art, their dissonant works
designed to expose
it as
contingent and class-based. The avant-garde also sought to
reintegrate art
and
life in order "to organize a new life praxis from a basis in
art."
(<I>TAG,</I>
49) But although the historical avant-garde succeeded in
unmasking the
institutionalized character of art in bourgeois society,
they were
unsuccessful
in destroying the institution of art--instead, their
"anti-art" activities
were
themselves absorbed 

<B></B>

 by this
institution and constituted as art. In several
important respects, B&uuml;rger's formulation of the rise
and fall of the
historical avant-garde appears to match the English medieval
modernists'
own rise
and fall: from their critiques of aesthetic formalism to the
failure of
their
more utopian dreams and the return of a formalist definition
of "fine art"
by
1945.

<p>
On closer inspection, however, B&uuml;rger's theory of an
historical
avant-garde
is rather ahistorical, relying more on suppositions about
art and culture
derived
from Hegel, Marx, and the Frankfurt School than on detailed
historical
investigation, and ultimately obscures more than it
illuminates. What, for
example, are we to make of his teleological conception of
art within
bourgeois
society as a gradual "unfolding" (<I>TAG,</I> 17) toward
complete autonomy,
blooming finally as aestheticism and the "institution of
art"? First, as
B&uuml;rger at times concedes, there was no unilateral trend
toward
autonomy in
the nineteenth century: George Leonard, for example, has
traced an
important
lineage of artists, extending from the early romantics such
as Wordsworth
through
John Cage, that regarded art and everyday life as
inseparable.
<sup><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
Furthermore, aestheticism itself was hardly the middle-class
ideal of art,
at
least if we accept the accounts of contemporaries at the
turn of the
century. And
the relationship between aestheticism and autonomy is more
vexed than
B&uuml;rger
allows: some aesthetes who seemed to deny art's social
function, such as
Walter
Pater or Oscar Wilde, actually held more complex positions
that allowed
for art's
association with the praxis of everyday life;
<sup><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
others, such as
Mallarm&eacute; and Yeats, associated their aesthetic
endeavors with a
sacred and
occult realm that had direct consequences for conduct in the
profane world.

<p>
The dubious utility of B&uuml;rger's notion of a bourgeois
"institution of
art,"
codifying and promoting aesthetic autonomy, becomes even
more pronounced
when we
examine the provenance of those who advocated aesthetic
"formalism" and
those who
insisted on a more socially engaged art. Not only did both
tend to be from
the
middle classes; we often find both positions being advocated
at different
times
by the same person. Fry, for example, was a prominent
advocate of art's
autonomy,
yet he remained ambivalent about the Quaker tradition of
service in which
he was
raised, and the arts and crafts tradition to which he
formerly belonged.
He had
been a member of the arts and crafts' society the Art
Workers' Guild (he
resigned
in 1910), and in 1913 he formed his own crafts workshop,
modelled after the
<I>botegas </I>of the Italian Renaissance, the Omega
Workshops Limited. He
tried
to present the Omega as an "autonomous" workshop that
created aesthetic
artifacts
that just happened to be useful; "purposive without purpose"
would have
served as
an ideal motto. Fry claimed that the Omega was formed
primarily to give
modern
artists part-time employment, and that the functionality of
the craft
objects was
secondary to more formalist concerns: "The Omega Workshops
Limited is a
group of
artists who are working with the object of allowing free
play to the
delight in
creation in the making of objects for common life."
<sup><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
This
attitude
might explain why many Omega products soon fell apart.

<p>
Nevertheless, Fry was also concerned with the social
function of modern
art,
despite his claims to the contrary; he wanted to increase
the public's
appreciation of 

<B></B>

 art and to beautify
their surroundings. Writing his mother
about
the formation of Omega, he stated that "my problem is now to
harness [art]
to
practical purposes. There's no doubt that it is a difficult
thing to do and
perhaps that is why almost all manufacturers give it up and
go to the
patient
hack instead of the artist for their designs."
<sup><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>
Even after
dissolving the Omega in 1920 for financial reasons, Fry
continued to be
ambivalent about the aesthetic formalism he and Bell had
championed. In
1926 he
welcomed Pick's use of modern artists, and noted "perhaps we
could save
ourselves
a good deal of painful and unnecessary emotion if we were
less exacting in
our
ideals, if we recognized that the real and pressing needs of
society are
not even
in what are called works of art concerned with the higher
spiritual
adventures."
<sup><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
Other examples of artists who shifted between an
"autonomous" and an "engaged" conception of art during this
period can be
cited.
Rather than distinguishing an autonomous modernism from an
engaged
avant-garde,
modernism should be viewed as containing both tendencies,
just as it
encompasses
other binaries such as primitivism/futurism,
subjectivity/objectivity,
classicism/romanticism, and nationalism/ cosmopolitanism.

<p>
Finally, if we are to accept the "avant-garde" as a
legitimate term for one
strand of modernism, we must still examine the extent to
which it is, or
ought to
be, an "oppositional" practice. B&uuml;rger presents the
avant-garde as
inherently oppositional, creating provocative, dissonant
works in order to
shock
its audience into reflecting critically about art's status
and purpose
(<I>TAG,</I> 56). Indeed, he is uneasy about the avant-garde
project, as
he fears
that an art integrated with life "will lose the capacity to
criticize it,
along
with its distance." (<I>TAG,</I> 50) Like the Frankfurt
School theorists
Max
Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, B&uuml;rger suggests that a
genuinely
critical art
must retain a certain distance from everyday life, or else
be co-opted by a
monolithic "culture industry" (<I>TAG,</I> 50,54). But
there have been
many
compelling critiques of the Culture Industry thesis, that
have questioned
the
imputed existence and aims of such an "Industry" as well as
the
accompanying
assumption that it retails unambiguous cultural messages
that will be
passively
received and accepted by its audience.
<sup><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>

<p>
It is clear that B&uuml;rger's "historically concrete"
theory of the
radically
oppositional character of the avant-garde, and his pessimism
regarding the
tenability of their aims, are both predicated on normative
assumptions
rather
than historical investigations. The extent of avant-garde
opposition to
contemporary social practices will vary, not only according
to individual
res, particular movements, and historical circumstances,
but also
according
to national traditions. In England the association of the
visual arts with
everyday life and practical purposes extends back through
the nineteenth
century,
reflecting the country's utilitarian biases, Protestant
heritage, and the
relatively close association between intellectuals and the
traditional
ruling
elite.
<sup><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>
Thus throughout the nineteenth century the government
justified public expenditures on museums and art education
on grounds of
utility:
art would be the handmaiden of industry.
<sup><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>
Art critics like
Ruskin,
on the other hand, attempted to legitimate the visual arts
on moral and
spiritual
grounds, in an attempt to overcome 

<B></B>

 the
nation's entrenched heritage of
iconoclasm. Finally, the state's minimal patronage of the
arts through
World War
II gave wide scope to local governments and individual
patrons to promote
the
arts, and many of these patrons--like Frank Pick--envisaged
themselves as
working
within widely shared cultural norms and traditions, even if
their immediate
appraisals of the meaning of modern art differed.

<p>
If we define the historical avant-garde as encompassing
those who
attempted to
integrate modern art and life, we must concede that the
English
avant-garde of
the interwar period tended to be no less Establishment than
oppositional.
This
Establishment aspect helps explain its effectiveness in
introducing modern
visual
art to the public: as we have seen, the English avant-garde
did not only
consist
of artists, but also of government officials, businessmen,
educators, and
members
of the media. They may not have instituted an Earthly
Paradise, but
through the
fervor of reformers reared on Ruskin and Morris the visual
arts attained a
prominent place in English culture. For centuries the
English had
congratulated
themselves on being preeminently a literary culture, openly
ceding pride
of place
in the visual arts to the Continent. Carlyle's "The Hero as
Man of Letters"
expresses this wider cultural bias; Matthew Arnold's
definition of culture
as
"the best which has been thought and said in this world"
pointedly left
out the
best that has been seen and arranged. Medieval modernists
helped restore
visual
art to a prominence that it may not have had in England
since the
Reformation.

<p>
The example of English medieval modernism demonstrates that
the historical
avant-garde cannot be defined in opposition to "modernism,"
and that it
need not

I admire and concur with D. L. LeMahieu's discussion of
interwar English
culture, but I disagree with his contention regarding the
English
avant-garde:
"Whatever their political affiliations, Left or Right, the
avant-garde in
England
retained the moral distance, social detachment, and
aesthetic superiority
characteristic of traditional elite culture." (D. L.
LeMahieu, <I>A
Culture for
Democracy: Mass Communication and the Cultivated Mind in
Britain Between
the Wars
</I>[New York: Oxford University Press, 1988], 207) This
does hold true for
certain artists and critics at some points in their
careers--Herbert Read,
for
example, switched repeatedly from seeing art as detached and
"formalist" to
seeing it as a well-made artifact fit for its purpose in
common life. On
the
whole, however, visual modernism in England during the
interwar period
tended to
be interpreted within a utilitarian and moral framework.

While Fry and Bell differed in aspects of their aesthetic
formulations,
they
both agreed that art was autonomous. Fry denied that art had
any
connection with
morality, and Bell's definition of "significant form"
exemplifies the
formalist
conception of art as autonomous:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The representative element in a work of art may or may not
be harmful;
always it
is irrelevant. For, to appreciate a work of art we need
bring with us
nothing
from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no
familiarity with its
emotions. Art transports us from the world of man's activity
to a world of
aesthetic exaltation. [Clive Bell, <I>Art </I>(1914;

Capricorn
Books, 1958), 27]

It is true that Morris's simple, geometrical designs did
influence
modern
design and architecture, but generally Ruskin and Morris's
Victorian social
aesthetic is seen as eclipsed by modernism's formalist
aesthetic.
Borzello, for
example, argues that while William Morris influenced many
fields, "of all
the
fields he influenced, fine art remained untouched" (Frances
Borzello,
<I>Civilizing Caliban </I>[London: Routledge &amp; Kegan
Paul, 1987], 7).
Similarly, Fishman argues that Ruskin had little influence
on art criticism
during the interwar period. See Solomon Fishman, <I>The
Interpretation of
Art
</I>(Berkeley: California University Press, 1963), 15. The
connection
between the
arts and crafts movement and modern industrial design and
architecture has
been
traced by Nikolaus Pevsner in his <I>Pioneers of Modern
Design </I>(London:
Penguin Books, 1975). Romantic medievalism has had a
significant impact on
modern
literature as well as modern art in this period, notably in
the works of
Eliot,
Pound, and Joyce. Joyce's nostalgia for the Middle Ages and
use of
scholastic
aesthetics has been explored by Umberto Eco, <I>The
Aesthetics of
Chaosmos: The
Middle Ages of James Joyce, </I>trans. Ellen Esrock
(Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard
University Press, 1989). The strong continuities between
romantic and
modernist
American poetry (including the works of Eliot and Pound)
have been noted by
Albert Gelpi: "Modernists, for all their loud inveighing
against
Romanticism,
longed for and adopted positions that are unmistakably,
though sometimes
covertly, Romantic." (Albert Gelpi, <I>A Coherent Splendor
</I>[Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1987], 5) Charles Harrison, in
<I>English Art
and
Modernism 1900-1939 </I>(London: Allan Tate, 1981) and S. K.
Tillyard have
both
discussed the influence of the arts and crafts movement on
Fry. Harrison
notes
some of the affinities between Fry's ideas and those of
Ruskin and Morris,
but
argues that Fry and Bell's "aesthetic" conception of art
separated them
from
Ruskin and Morris's sociological conception. Tillyard argues
that the
"discourse"
of the arts and crafts movement shaped Fry's initial
explanation of
post-impressionism, as well as the public's reception of the
1910
exhibition
"Manet and the Post-Impressionists." She then contends that
Fry and Bell
developed a more specific "language" and "aesthetic" for
postimpressionism
between 1910 and 1914 that no longer referred to the arts
and crafts
aesthetic,
and that this new formalist discourse went unchallenged
following the
First World
War. (S. K. Tillyard, <I>The Impact of Modernism, 1900-1920
</I>[London:
Routledge, 1988], 199-216, 248-50) Thus, while arguing for
continuities
through
1910, she also sees the years 1910-12 as marking a decisive
break with the
past
that was firmly established by 1918. I believe that this
strictly formalist
aesthetic was strongly challenged throughout the interwar
period, and that
the
reception and assimilation of modern art through the late
1930s owed as
much to
the romantic medievalism of Pugin, Ruskin, and Morris as it
did to the
formalism
of Fry and Bell.

To cite one of many examples: after visiting the first

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Roughly, it is a consideration of how an abstract design of
direction and
masses
can be applied to a street or a city. It is an appeal to a
better type of
artist
to take more interest in and more part in the general life
of the world,
if only
in the interest of his own shop, and to attempt to change
the form content
of
civilized life. The artist labouring in his studio, the
absolute schism
between
him and life, is displayed: and I consider how this is
affecting painting
and is
likely to affect its further progress. [<I>The Letters of

A remarkable number of the most influential patrons and
proselytizers
of
modern art came from Yorkshire, which was also notable for
being the
birthplace
of several of England's finest modern artists, with Henry
Moore, Barbara
Hepworth, and Edward Wadsworth among them. These patrons
from Yorkshire
included
Frank Pick, William Rothenstein, Herbert Read, Michael
Sadler, Charles
Holme,
Raymond Unwin, Charles Rutherston, Percy Jowett, A. R.
Orage, Holbrook
Jackson,
the art publishing firm of Lund Humphries, and the
publisher/gallery firm
Zwemmers. Prior to the World War I, Leeds was arguably the
modern art
capital of
England. The Leeds Arts Club (founded by Orage and Jackson),
Leeds
University
(under the vice-chancellorship of Sadler), and the Leeds Art
Museum
(during the
curatorship of Frank Rutter, later the art critic for the
<I>Sunday
Times</I>)
were influential in bringing modern art and modern artists
to the North of
England, where impressionable students like Read and Moore
were exposed to
the
new artistic currents.

Board of Education memo regarding a conversation with Pick,
10 January
1936,
PRO, ED 136/9. During World War II the government realized
that they were
far
behind many other nations in industrial design for
light-metal industry
products,
and struggled to find ways to catch up. E. M. Dickey of the
Board of
Education
admitted in 1943 that design for products of
"non-traditional" industries
had not
been seriously considered for most of the 1930s:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The design for appearance of engineering products from
machine tools and
locomotives to typewriters and sewing machines was not
specifically dealt
with in
Frank Pick's "Design and the Designer". We thought this was
partly because
the
topic was hardly in the air at the time the Arts &amp;
Industry Council
issued
that report and partly because Mr. Pick's own scheme for
good design in
everything to do with London Transport was so satisfactory
that he did not
need
to take the then newly streamlined USA locomotives etc. very
seriously.

In many of his writings Pick defended commerce as a "liberal
art," in
an
attempt to raise its status. As far as he was concerned, the
world of
commerce
was comparable to the world of gentility: "Industry is an
alternative mode
of
association to the public school." (Frank Pick, "Education
and Training in
the
Transportation Service," 1929, file A21, p. 18, London
Transport Museum)
In this
Pick may have drawn inspiration from Ruskin, who had told a
Manchester
audience
that "I believe tradesman may be, ought to be--often are,
more gentlemen
than
idle and useless people." ("A Joy Forever," <I>The Complete
Works of John
Ruskin,
</I>vol. 5 [New York: The Kelmscott Society, n.d.], 75)

Charles Holden, the architect who worked closely with Pick
in the
interwar
period, recalled how expeditious Pick could be. Holden
presented Pick with
the
plans for the new Underground headquarters: "A telephone
call, a meeting
with him
the same afternoon, a board meeting later the same afternoon
and then a
message
'Right, carry on'. Quick work: but Pick was like that, he
knew there was
always
time to correct a false move." (Charles Holden, "Frank
Pick," file

As Pick stated in 1927, "To visit a picture show and to come
out again
into
the streets ought to mean that for the moment at least the
eye sees things
anew.
So it is with the poster." (Frank Pick, "Underground
Posters," 1927, file

Holden's Underground Headquarters at St. James' Street has a
cruciform
shape
like that of the medieval cathedrals, although Holden stated
that he gave
the
building this design because he had to accommodate traffic
from two
separate
streets, and thus the design was the most fit for its
purpose. Lawrence
Menear
describes both the Cockfosters Station and the Uxbridge
Station as
resembling
cathedrals; see <I>London's Underground Stations </I>(1983;
reprint,

Wages and benefits were relatively high, and employees were
rewarded
for
useful suggestions to improve the system. See Frank Pick,
"Progress,"
November
1926, file A15, London Transport Museum; and idem,
"Education and Training
in the
Transport Service," July 1929, file A21, London Transport
Museum. In the
latter,
Pick noted that the use of automated devices within the
system did
eliminate some
jobs of a tedious or menial nature (automated doors on the
Tubes, for
example,
led to the elimination of human door-openers). While
regretting having to
let
some workers go, Pick believed that the use of machines for
unskilled
labor would
ultimately create more challenging jobs, worthy of an
individual's time:
"A man
should be employed as a man to use the whole of his
faculties and
abilities in
his work, and not as a mere unit of power, capable of doing
some
particular piece
of manual labor."

Among those influenced by the Underground's example were
Jack
Beddington of
Shell-Mex, Stephen Tallents of the Empire Marketing Board
and the General
Post
Office, Colin Anderson of the Orient Line, Jack Pritchard of
Isokon, and

Pick's visions became more grandiose in the 1930s, when the
LPTB was
formed;
he felt he now had the power he needed to make London, in
Lethaby's
phrase, "neat
and tidy." Statements such as the following were common:
"These patterns of
transport constitute the indispensable framework upon which
London must be
built." (Frank Pick, "The Organisation of Transport,"
<I>Journal of the
Royal
Society of the Arts </I>[3 January 1936]: 214)

Jerome Hamilton Buckeley, <I>The Victorian Temper </I>(New
York:
Vintage
Books, 1951), 180-82. Richard Ellmann discusses Wilde's
"post-aestheticism" in
which Wilde links art to life, quoting the following from
Wilde's 1884
lecture
"The Value of Art in Modern Life": "I have found that all
ugly things are
made by
those who strive to make something beautiful, and that all
beautiful
things are
made by those who strive to make something useful." (Richard
Ellmann,
<I>Oscar
Wilde </I>[London: Hamish Hamilton, 1987], 246) This was not
simply a
Wildean
paradox; it was a remark often made by followers of the arts
and crafts
tradition. Eric Gill wrote in 1921, "Man's quality is
chiefly exhibited in
his
works and that the physical form of things is not determined
by caprice
but by
their nature and purpose: That if you take care of Truth and
Goodness,
Beauty
will take care of itself." (Eric Gill, <I>Art-Nonsense and
Other Essays
</I>[London: Cassell &amp; Co., 1929], 65)

that the attack on the individuality of the artist is an
