<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Poet, art critic and promoter, literary critic, journalist, editor
and publisher, novelist, dramatist, movie-script writer, prankster,
pornographer, and impresario of the Parisian avant-garde, Guillaume
Apollinaire is regarded as everything except a political man.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 He himself promoted this view. Writing to the editor of <I>La Plume</I>
 in 1902, he claimed to have nothing to say about politics, a subject
 that is "detestable, deceitful, sterile, and injurious" ("ha&iuml;ssable,
 mensong&egrave;re, st&eacute;rile et n&eacute;faste").
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In thousands of pages of prewar writing, he signed only one article
 that might be considered political thought.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The fact that he turned to political subjects during World War I might be
 explained contingently in terms of his enthusiasm for the war experience
 and his recognition of its historical import. Yet, paradoxically, never
 was there so relentlessly public a life as Apollinaire's, and no one
 has ever dedicated more energy to the promotion of art as an answer to
 the spiritual malaise of modern life. In that sense, his indefatigable
 production of criticism as well as his unending public performance of
 self were nothing if not political both in intent and effect.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When we look closely at his one published piece of political philosophy,
the paradox begins to unravel. Based on premises drawn explicitly from
Spinoza's <I>Ethics</I> but also from Nietzsche, Apollinaire argued that
politics in the sense of government is

<B></B>

nothing but the pursuit of power by politicians and that any notion
that it might promote social improvement misunderstands the human
condition. Humans may express genuine sympathy for their fellows, but
this sentiment is always subordinate to a primary egotism. While an
individual may be gratified by helping another individual, acts of
so-called "charity" which minister to the collective serve only to
salve the consciences of the rich and powerful. Similarly, "politics
does have the often forgotten aim of aiding others <I>en bloc</I>"
("La politique n'a pour but, souvent oubli&eacute;, que de les aider
en bloc"), but government is too blunt an instrument to succeed in any
such endeavor, excepting perhaps that of allowing politicians to imagine
themselves virtuous.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Is there, then, no genuinely collective mode of social redemption? Though
 the question is not addressed here, it is notable that, less than a month
 later, Apollinaire would see in Picasso's early painting precisely the
 force capable of reawakening "the profound self-knowledge that humanity
 had of itself" and giving us back the "eyes" necessary for entering
 into the social world of children, mothers, beggars, and forlorn old men.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It was an argument for the socially redemptive power of avant-garde
 art to which he would return on many subsequent occasions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This essay will argue that Apollinaire's apparent apoliticism was a mask
for his deepest conviction, one to which he dedicated his life: that only
through the visionary power of avant-garde art could men and women living
in modern mass societies regain their human capacity for the concrete
experience of life, a capacity that had withered amidst the abstractions
of commodified, urban existence. Far from representing a solution to this
modern crisis, the issue-oriented, materialistically self-interested
politics shaped by newspapers and propelled by the wheeler-dealing of
the democratic electoral process only compounded it. This public sphere
merely reinforced the mechanical, quantitative, and ultimately nihilistic
modes of thought underlying modern industry and science. A revitalized
public sphere would depend crucially upon the restoration of aesthetic
vision, language, and performance to a position of genuine centrality in
modern political life. In a properly aesthetic public sphere, art would
reconnect with daily life and with concrete, national traditions, thus
reviving the national spirit and reconsecrating civic energies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the sections which follow, I aim to show, first, that recent
theoretical and historical work on modernism helps to clarify the larger
context of Apollinaire's aesthetic politics and, specifically, its
nationalistic turn; second, that his nationalism was deeply rooted in
his generation as well as in his own life circumstances; third, that the
model of a performative public sphere with which he implicitly worked
can be reconstructed from his art criticism; and, finally, that his
differences with F. T. Marinetti's Futurism turn on their differing
nationalisms and strategies for confronting mass society and culture
and that, despite appearances, those differences did not abate during
the war. Apollinaire's wartime chauvinism should not be seen as a break
with his prewar aesthetic politics, though it did reflect the greatly
intensified pressures on everyone to prove their national loyalty,
pressures to which he had always, necessarily, been highly sensitive.

1. Modernism, Mass Culture, and Nationalism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nineteenth-century bourgeois society provided for a freedom of artistic
creation far greater than in earlier societies where art was more
tightly controlled by political, religious, and social mechanisms. As
Theodor Adorno argued in <I>Aesthetic Theory</I>, art had always stood
in opposition to society but, because it was unaware of itself as such,
a fundamentally oppositional art had been inconceivable prior to the
French Revolution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bourgeois society emancipates art in the sense that experience is no
 longer forced into apriori genres and period styles but is allowed to
 give birth to artistic form rather than the other way round. Yet, if
 this emancipation makes possible an oppositional art, it also unleashes
 a process of commodification which, by the century's closing decades,
 was threatening to redefine art as entertainment and integrate it even
 more effectively than in earlier, more authoritarian societies. For
 Adorno, this paradoxical situation in which art is simultaneously freed
 in principle and yet neutralized in social practice provides the context
 for, and in a general way defines, the phenomenon of artistic modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism, as I understand it following Adorno, is the effort to overcome
the commodification of culture through the conviction that art has a
fundamental role to play in restoring, or reinventing, the qualitative
dimension of existence. Modernists see art as a cognitive sphere separate
from, and in opposition to, those of science and morality, thus as one
side of a triangle that, as Habermas following Weber has argued, becomes
constitutive of modern intellectual and cultural life in this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 For art to help restore the qualitative dimension, which Adorno terms
 the "non-identical," modernists believe that it must come to understand
 itself in its own terms, to pursue its own autonomous cognitive existence
 independent of its earlier religious, moral, and cultic functions. Such
 autonomy does not mean formalism as an end in itself, but it does mean
 close attention to form. Its true end is the suspension of "identity
 thinking" by pursuing art's own immanent logic independent of all
 externally generated values, whether cognitive (like "representing" the
 world) or social (like "entertainment"). It means searching for what
 is art and nothing else. The problem, however, is that modernism is
 never able to realize this autonomy, for to do so would be tantamount to
 locating the essential nature of art. Adorno sees modernism as condemned
 to search endlessly and in vain for this answer, that is, for "the new,"
 which is why he writes that "the new is the longing for the new, not the
 new itself" (<I>AT</I>, 32). Indeed, in its pursuit of the new, modernism
 ends up mimicking the commodity form it had sought to escape: the new
 "is aesthetically the result of historical development, the trademark of
 consumer goods appropriated by art by means of which artworks distinguish
 themselves from the ever-same inventory in obedience to the need for
 the exploitation of capital, which, if it does not expand, if it does
 not--in its own language--offer something new, is eclipsed . . . . [Thus]
 the absolute artwork converges with the absolute commodity" (<I>AT</I>,
 21). Seeking its autonomous essence, modernist art discovers only that
 it lacks essentiality, that it is condemned, like capital, to an endless
 search for the new, to becoming evanescent "fashion."

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This restless, questing character that Adorno sees in modernist art
has been noted by many other observers, most famously perhaps by Renato
Poggioli, who called it the "agonism" of the avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Yet, in my view, this agonism ought not to be understood solely as
 an internal characteristic of the modernist avant-garde but also as a
 reflection of, and response to, a late nineteenth-century public sphere
 exploding in vigor and reconstituting itself under the impact of a new
 mass politics. Nowhere was this more true than in France. There, as
 many recent historians have shown, we find a vibrant public life after
 1880 based on a dramatic expansion of mass-circulation newspapers,
 the proliferation of "little reviews," the development of political
 "leagues," "protestations," and mass parties, the beginnings of a
 mass-entertainment industry, the emergence of the "new woman," and the
 "birth of intellectuals" with the media-fanned political controversies
 of the 1890s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Demands from below for inclusion, new media of communication and
 information, new appreciation of the power of irrational symbolic appeals
 such as anti-Semitism, and a proliferation of mass-cultural spectacles
 made for a heady brew.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What French historians have recognized as an intensified
turn-of-the-century public sphere has, however, been insufficiently
integrated into broader theoretical understandings of the bourgeois public
sphere. This neglect probably owes much to the fact that Habermas, in his
now classic study of the topic, was so preoccupied with the deterioration
of the public sphere into a mere "platform for advertising" that he read
this as its predominant tendency all the way back to 1850.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Yet the advance of market forces within the late nineteenth-century
 public sphere was gradual; the overwhelming power of capitalist culture
 industries will be clear only with the triumph of American cinema
 and the coming of the radio age in the 1930s. In what we might call
 the modernist window of 1890-1930, the presence of modern mass
 culture and technology was sufficient to force a rethinking of art,
 commodification, and modern public life, yet it was not so entrenched
 as to seem unsubvertible. This was a transitional period in which the
 relation between market forces, lingering aristocratic standards of
 taste, individual ingenuity and craftsmanship, and a newly enlarged
 mass audience was being renegotiated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist intellectuals played a very visible and underappreciated role
in this process of renegotiation. Perceiving themselves as an embattled
minority, a drop of culture in an ocean of philistinism, they sought
to rebuild a public sphere not on an Enlightenment model of rational
discourse but on the agonistic model exemplified by Nietzsche. For them,
public life was best conceived not as a rational process of discussion
governed by consensus and the better argument (a Habermasian ideal they
would have found much too beholden to science and too repressive of the
expressive dimension of communication that they could uniquely offer) but
as one of persuasion by performance--performance still governed by the
creative ideals of the artist and not by market forces. In this sense
autonomous art, far from being a retreat into isolation, represented
precisely the standard needed to govern public life. Only an ideal of
creative performance could hope to overcome the exhaustion of older
aristocratic standards as well as the vulgar materialism of emerging
mass-democratic

<B></B>

 societies, whose politics of who gets what, where, when, how, and from
 whom, either ignored or disdainfully dismissed questions of greatness
 and larger purpose. In modern society, where all particulars become
 fungible, modernists believed that art could reshape public life by
 conducting the exchangeable to critical self-consciousness, that is,
 to an awareness of what lies beyond exchange.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism, then, was not merely a reaction formation to mass culture,
as Adorno generally viewed it. Modernists believed in the power of their
own creative initiative to seize the day. Yet, for reasons that we have
already identified in Adorno and Habermas, their attempt to reshape modern
public life would ultimately fail. The fact that modernists pursued
such a project, however, has at least three important implications for
our understanding of their efforts. First, it suggests that we conceive
modernism as a decisive break with the Enlightenment metanarrative of
emancipation via public learning modeled on scientific advance. The sorts
of objections to Habermas that Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard would make
in <I>The Postmodern Condition</I> were already the basis of modernist
practice eight decades earlier. Second, their pursuit of an ideal of a
performative public sphere suggests that the response to mass culture
of which they are often accused--that of merely installing themselves
as an elitist alternative to it without engaging the public--is
too simplistic. In confronting incipient culture industries and the
new technologies like cinema on which they were increasingly based,
modernists might be said to have had three choices: to capitulate to
this new reality by seeking to become its "stars," to run the other way
and set up a counter-industry, or to try to subvert this new reality in
a way that accepted the need to play to an expanded public but rejected
exchange as the determinant of value. While modernists obviously did
not always make the same choice, they most frequently followed the
last alternative of bending mass society to their own design. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, the modernist interest in a performative
public sphere made them much more attuned to the emotional appeals of
nationalism than is generally perceived in the literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we return to Apollinaire, this last point requires some
elaboration. Early in the nineteenth century, nationalist thinking
was stimulated partly under the influence of Napoleonic conquest but
partly too in response to the same separation of cognitive spheres that
stimulated romanticism and ultimately modernism. As George Mosse has
shown for Germany, this nationalist thinking was intensely aesthetic
because it aimed to restore meaning to a sundered experiential life as
well as because aesthetic politics proved to have great mass appeal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Nationalism's ideal, like that of most Romanticisms and post-Kantian
 idealisms, was that of a retotalized social world in which divisions
 between the divine and human, rational and emotional, public and
 private sides of life would be overcome. Here modernists tended toward
 a different strategy: their commitment to an ideal of autonomous art
 made them wary of reconciling art and culture with the contemporary
 economy and state. Yet their assessment of the problems in modern life
 and their emphasis on the aesthetic brought them close to nationalist
 aesthetic politics, as res such as Maurice Barr&egrave;s and Jean
 Mor&eacute;as remind us. Modernists often found it attractive and
 sometimes necessary to

<B></B>

develop nationalist sentiments of their own, even as they also explored
the universalist, cosmopolitan logic of their creative pursuits. Indeed,
as we shall see, for modernists like Apollinaire whose personal
backgrounds and identities were ambiguous or uncertain with respect to
nationality, the cosmopolitan image of modernism may even have intensified
nationalist sentiment.

2. Apollinaire: The Intellectual Formation of a "Non-political Man"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Apollinaire published his first major book of poetry in 1913, the
reviewer for the <I>Mercure de France</I>, Georges Duhamel, greeted it
in the following terms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Nothing makes one think more of a secondhand furniture dealer than
this collection of verse published by M. Guillaume Apollinaire under
the title, at once simple and mysterious, of <I>Alcools</I>. I say
secondhand furniture dealer because a litter of incongruous objects
have been discarded into this slum, some of which have value but none
of which is the product of the merchant's own industry. Precisely there
is one of the characteristics of the secondhand trade: it resells but
does not manufacture. . . . In the massing of objects, a colorful and
dizzy variety takes the place of art. With difficulty one can perceive,
through the holes of a shabby chasuble, the ironic and ingenuous look
of the dealer, which is at once that of the Levantine Jew, the South
American, the Polish gentleman, and the <I>facchino</I> [porter].
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The attack, whose motives are now obscure, must have seemed to Apollinaire
like the flashing forth of a nightmare he had been living since coming
to Paris at the age of eighteen. There it all was: the wandering life of
his Polish mother who had taken him from birth in Rome to Monaco, then
Cannes, Nice, Aix-les-Bains, Lyon, Paris, Stavelot in Belgium, and back
to Paris; his own economic struggles to survive in the French capital
as a bohemian writer; the fact that his mother lived for years out of
wedlock with a Jewish man, Jules Weil; that he himself was often mistaken
for a Jew since "the anti-Semites cannot imagine a Pole not being a Jew"
("les antis&eacute;mites qui ne peuvent se rer qu'un Polonais ne
soit pas juif);
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 that he was uncomfortable enough with his apparently immigrant, Jewish,
 and "southern" background to drop his foreign-sounding surname; that he
 had famously been arrested on suspicion of stealing the <I>Mona Lisa</I>
 from the Louvre; that his life had been full of expediencies and shady
 dealings; that he was, in short, as French xenophobes of the time called
 them, a <I>"m&eacute;t&egrave;que"</I> [wop], and an illegitimate one
 at that.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Painful as his vulnerability to such scurrilousness must have been,
 Apollinaire was hardly unfamiliar with it. From the beginning of his
 literary career, he had been made aware of his ethnic otherness by
 editors who, for example, refused to allow him to replace Kostrowitzky
 with a pseudonym.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Still, he never retreated into a defensive cosmopolitanism but rather, as
 one critic has put it, deployed a "poetic counter-ideology," peopling his
 essays and verse with a "mythology of Tziganes, Bohemians, Germans, Jews,
 Cossacks, etc., into which he integrated his own genealogical fantasies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In the clear light of day, however, he always regarded himself as a

<B></B>

Frenchman. Indeed, for his adopted homeland he had the passion of a
religious convert. His friends were &eacute;migr&eacute;s or visitors
from every corner of Europe, and he reveled in their company, but even
the Italians he did not regard as in any way fellow countrymen. At
the height of the controversy between cubism and Futurism, he wrote to
Ardengo Soffici, his most faithful correspondent, who had himself lived
seven years in Paris: "But <I>you Italians</I>, don't be unfair toward
the French who have created nearly all of intellectual modernism" ("Mais
<I>Vous Italiens</I>, ne soyez pas injustes envers les fran&ccedil;aises
car ils ont invent&eacute; presque tous le modernisme intellectuel").
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Moreover, he nearly always wrote in French and, when he did deploy his
 Italian, showed that it was rudimentary and error-prone, a product of
 early childhood in a country to which he never returned even for a visit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the firmness of his national identity reflected its objective
precariousness, it was also rooted in an intellectual formation which
was typically and self-consciously French. Admittedly, we do not know
as much as we would like about this formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Yet when Apollinaire himself reflected back on it in 1908, he singled
 out for attention an avant-garde movement of the previous decade that
 had already nearly been forgotten:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The most important poetic current which, striking the spirit of the
youth of my generation, sought to oppose symbolism, which it succeeded,
was called naturism. It had its day and charmed many new poets. At
that time, because of symbolism, they were still weighed down by the
cumbersome baggage of accessories bequeathed by the Parnassians who
took them from the romantics. The  naturists swept all that away. Then,
prodded by civic enthusiasm, they wanted to mingle with the crowd.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Naturism was quickly forgotten because it was unable to translate its
ideas into distinguished verse, but the ideas themselves, as communicated
in a variety of manifestos, were a powerful reflection of the final years
of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle. Promulgated primarily by two young poets,
Saint-Georges de Bouh&eacute;lier and Maurice Le Blond, naturism embodied
an intense desire to find new ways for a young generation of artists
to have an impact on French politics in the aftermath of the French
police clamp-down on anarchism in 1894. Like Mor&eacute;as, who broke
with symbolism in 1891 to found the &Eacute;cole Romane, the naturists
saw symbolism as having a disdain for the national literary tradition
as well as cultivating a <I>recherch&eacute;</I> language far removed
from that of the street and the practical problems of life. Unlike him,
however, they did not want to create just another <I>"c&eacute;nacle,</I>"
nor to return to traditional verse, but to set a resolutely modernist,
aesthetic-political direction for their generation as a whole. It was a
vision that appealed to some slightly older French intellectuals as well,
such as Andr&eacute; Gide who, in an 1896 letter to Bouh&eacute;lier,
declared his "very lively sympathy" for naturism and signed it as "your
<I>coreligionaire</I>" ("une sympathie tr&egrave;s vive . . . votre
<I>coreligionaire</I>").
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we turn to naturism's inaugural manifesto, published by
Bouh&eacute;lier in <I>Le ro</I> on January 10, 1897, we
cannot but be struck by the intensely nationalistic rhetoric in which
its largely political purposes are set. It calls for the "resurrection
of national 

<B></B>

cults." It opposes the "northern poets" and wants "regional ceremonies in
 honor of the 'heroes who died for their country.'" It champions "civic
 activity," "glory" and "exploits." It claims that "the next art will
 be heroic" and aims "to create a new conception of the world." While
 some of the language about "moral enslavement" and the "spirit of
 the race" sounds vaguely Nietzschean, non-French writers and artists
 like Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Wagner are held up as "foreigners" who have
 triumphed over properly "ethnic literature." Bouh&eacute;lier concludes:
 "Revival of the national spirit, a cult of the earth and of heroes, the
 consecration of civic energies, these are the sentiments that give to
 contemporary youth such a unique, unexpected and admirable character."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument was deepened in essays written for a special issue of
<I>La Plume</I> on naturism that appeared in November, 1897, which
included contributions from Eug&egrave;ne Montfort, Albert Fleury, and
the Belgian naturist Camille Lemonnier, as well as Bouh&eacute;lier and
Le Blond. Striking a revolutionary chord, Bouh&eacute;lier likened the
task of his generation to that of Mirabeau, Robespierre, and Desmoulins,
and claimed that "we are at a turning point between epochs. The world's
equilibrium is being reconstituted. . . . God has disappeared from
the world," but naturism has adopted the "mission" of helping "a new
world free itself from the chaos of our times"("Nous sommes &agrave; un
tournant des &acirc;ges. Le &eacute;quilibre du monde se reconstitue
. . . Dieu a disparu du monde . . . la mission . . . un monde nouveau
se d&eacute;gage du chaos des temps").
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In his essay, Le Blond connected naturism's nationalist program to
 the failings of the recent French poetic tradition, including the
 &Eacute;cole Romane. For him, the symbolist poets "preferred to be
 the solitary pontiffs of their interior cathedral" rather than "the
 interpreters of a place, region, or people." They cultivated a "special
 jargon" that was little known. Moreover, many of them followed in a
 romantic tradition that was still a "Christian art." Naturists, in
 contrast, cultivate the "ethnic idea." While others before us, like
 the &Eacute;cole Romane, have done likewise, we are forward-looking
 modernists while they are "reactionary" devotees of "archaism." Finally,
 "Mor&eacute;as, who is of Greek origin, may have his reasons for
 celebrating the reeds of the river Eurotas and the snows of Mount
 Olympus. These traditions are not ours. In our view, to the Madeleine or
 the Bourse, monuments based on a pastiche of antique styles, we always
 prefer Notre-Dame of Paris."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Le Blond's chauvinism, with which he here tarred Mor&eacute;as, may
remind us of Duhamel's later tactics. Yet Le Blond and other naturists
understood their commitment to nationality not as an end in itself but
as a necessary condition for freeing modern art from poetic formalism
in order to engage it in the revitalization of modern life. They were
committed to enlarging the concept of art in an inclusive direction, to
overcoming distinctions between high and low art, to reconnecting art
with daily life, and to restoring to the intellectual his human face
("Mallarm&eacute; is an artist, Verlaine is a man" ["Mallarm&eacute;
est un artiste, Verlaine est un homme"]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 While they believed that rootedness in concrete ways of life was crucial
 to this endeavor, such concreteness could be Belgian (as with Lemonnier),
 or that of another "border nation" ('nations de fronti&egrave;re') or
 that of a particular French region. Indeed, an important part of what
 was at stake for naturism was the cultural hegemony of Paris.

<B></B>

Naturist writers in Provence, for example, sometimes referred to the
"tyrannical yoke of Paris" ("joug tyrannique de Paris").
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The <I>Revue Naturiste</I>, which Bouh&eacute;lier and Le Blond edited
 from Paris, in effect agreed with them, proposing in 1898 to decentralize
 itself with three regionally tailored editions in order to increase
 the provinces' sense of dignity (<I>CVS</I>, 82).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among other naturist projects was a Coll&egrave;ge d'Esth&eacute;tique
Moderne which, during the 1900-1901 academic year, offered a
series of lecture courses by Bouh&eacute;lier, Le Blond, and Montfort,
and which attracted the participation of Apollinaire (<I>CVS</I>,
115-117). For Apollinaire, these would be years of great economic
uncertainty but also of intellectual apprenticeship in the post-symbolist
intellectual free-for-all that was Paris in the time of Dreyfus. He
wrote for a variety of little reviews including <I>La Revue blanche</I>,
<I>L'Europ&eacute;en</I>, <I>Tabarin</I>, <I>La Grande France</I>, <I>La
Plume</I>, and <I>L'Europe artiste</I>. He attended the "soir&eacute;es
de <I>La Plume</I>" that its editor, Karl Bo&egrave;s, gave at the
Caveau du Soleil d'Or on the Place Saint-Michel. There he met all the
naturists as well as other young poets like Andr&eacute; Salmon, Paul
Fort, Alfred Jarry, and M&eacute;cislas Golberg, a Jewish anarchist from
Poland, and more established res like Mor&eacute;as and R&eacute;my de
Gourmont. He entered the polemics on new poetic schools, such as Fernand
Gregh's "humanism," declaring that "poets no longer want ecclesiastics,
scholastics, scholars, students, disciples, or, in a word, slaves" ("Les
po&egrave;tes ne veulent plus &ecirc;tre ni &eacute;col&acirc;tres, ni
escholiers, ni &eacute;coliers, ni &eacute;l&egrave;ves, ni disciples:
ni esclaves en un mot").
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 He began his own journal, <I>Le Festin d'&Eacute;sope</I>, which
 produced nine issues in 1903-04 that included poetry, stories,
 criticism, philosophical articles, and an occasional political article
 and naturist manifesto, but also practical information on medicine
 and financial investments. It was succeeded in April 1905 by <I>La
 Revue immoraliste</I> which, however, lasted but a single issue after
 its patron bailed out. Thereafter, Apollinaire wrote for a variety of
 journals, large and small, mainstream and esoteric, but gave up his
 efforts at being an editor until he established <I>Les Soir&eacute;es
 de Paris</I> (1912-14).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite his naturism, Apollinaire wrote some early poems in
a symbolist vein, and he took a lively interest in the neo-symbolist
initiative of Fort's <I>Vers et Prose</I> when it was launched in 1905
(<I>CVS</I>, 180-83). Yet, when he made the discovery of Picasso's
painting and began to write about it in that same year, the road toward
cultural regeneration through a genuinely non-mimetic mode of expression
increasingly appeared to him to run through the plastic arts. In contrast,
the symbolist way beyond mimesis focused centrally upon Dionysian music,
which symbolists found suggestive of the impalpable powers associated
with an ideal language. While they were not entirely uninterested in the
visual and plastic arts, they tended toward the belief that such arts
imposed too great a mimetic constraint. That Apollinaire increasingly
conceived matters differently owed a great deal to what he saw in painters
like Picasso, though it may also reflect the changed status of visuality
within the cultural world more generally. His was the century of film,
after all, and Apollinaire was very interested in cinema both for its
own sake and for the ways in which it might invigorate the other arts,
especially poetry.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Picasso and other new painters inspired Apollinaire to believe was
that the creative artist can best think through the possibilities of an
autonomous, non-mimetic art by confronting external appearances, not by
attempting somehow to get above or within them. This is precisely what
he saw Picasso doing: accepting the irreducible difference represented
by the object but then investigating that difference in a playful,
creative way that allowed him to express his own world rather than
duplicate an external one. Through play with the object, Picasso was
able to investigate the relation between seeing, remembering and artistic
presentation, and thereby "reenchant" a disenchanted world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire collected the most important of his Picasso-inspired
reflections on cultural regeneration, revised them, and then published
them as <I>M&eacute;ditations Esth&eacute;tiques: Les Peintres
Cubistes</I> in 1913. As we will see, they represent the theoretical
foundation not only of his own poetic art but of his approach to the
public sphere and the larger political hopes so beautifully encapsulated
in the lines from the "Po&egrave;me lu au mariage d'Andr&eacute; Salmon"
which serve as the epigraph to this essay. Before concluding this
section, however, we need to complete our brief picture of Apollinaire's
intellectual formation with two points that complicate the vision of a
socially redemptive art which the <I>M&eacute;ditations</I> articulate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first of these is the naturist legacy: Apollinaire consistently placed
his vision of a socially redemptive art within a nationalistic frame,
even as he sometimes softened the ethnic-nationalist understanding of that
frame which one finds in a Bouh&eacute;lier, Le Blond, or Barr&egrave;s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As he put the point in an essay on the decorative arts: "The artisan who
 chisels, shapes, or carves out an object meant for everyday usage ought
 to remain anonymous. The taste of which the object is a manifestation,
 like the decorations that adorn it, belongs to a given period, nation,
 and environment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Genuine art is always rooted in the concrete national conditions of a
 people. Even mere exposure to foreign art may sow "confusion . . . in the
 minds of our artisans" as well as doing them "great harm" commercially.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 For obvious reasons, however, Apollinaire was more reluctant to
 dismiss "foreigners" as irrelevant to French art in the manner
 of Bouh&eacute;lier. As the judge of an exhibition, for example,
 "a foreigner, who is outside the Parisian coteries and free of the
 influence of critics who are often submissive and rarely disinterested,
 will be naturally drawn to the most important works."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Moreover, Apollinaire generally did not define as a foreigner anyone
 who falls outside the French "race." He most often operated with an
 inclusive definition of Frenchness that is civic rather than ethnic. He
 was not, however, entirely consistent in this regard and occasionally
 utilized a concept of "Latinity" which, from its association with
 Edouard Drumont and Charles Maurras, had ethnic-nationalist and even
 anti-Semitic overtones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 All that is certain is that the naturist view that art and its capacity
 for social redemption must always be connected with the concrete national
 conditions of a people remained fundamental for him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second point concerns the danger represented by processes of
industrialization and commercialization for the eclipse of avant-garde
art. Apollinaire was more nervous about the survivability of avant-garde
art than the discussion of the

<B></B>

<I>M&eacute;ditations</I> would suggest. In an article for the republican
journal, <I>La D&eacute;mocratie sociale</I>, for example, he argued
that "mechanical processes threaten every form of art that involves the
physical capacities of the artist." Art was becoming "industrialized." Yet
while orchestras, theaters, and "painters who content themselves with
copying nature" might give way to the phonograph, the cinematographer,
and the photographer, Apollinaire here argued that "great painters" who
"express the sublime plastically" cannot be replaced.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Still, the level of anxiety in the article is sufficient that one is
 not surprised to read elsewhere in Apollinaire that "today's young
 painters" are succumbing to the dangers of "industrialization" and
 artistic overproduction far more than established avant-gardists like
 Picasso, Braque, Derain, and de Chirico.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 The evident implication, which he chose not to make explicit, was that
 the days of avant-garde art might well be numbered.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

3.  Apollinaire and the Public Sphere
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's idea that the socially redemptive role of avant-garde art
was best conceived in terms of the "plastic virtues" that symbolism had
largely neglected emerged only after his reflection upon the painting
of Picasso and Matisse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Yet some of his earliest poems already evidence an interest in
 language very different from the symbolist quest for an ideality
 merging concrete world and poetic imagination. As Timothy Matthews
 has persuasively argued, poems such as "L'Adieu," which Apollinaire
 published in <I>Le Festin d'&Eacute;sope</I> in December 1903, aim
 primarily to undermine any stable sense of the relation between words
 and sensations or experiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 In such poems, language is presented as a form of purely human
 expression, as a set of word-constructs that recognizes its own
 artificiality and that defies ready reference to any framework outside
 the poem itself. If symbolism sought to transcend difference and
 merge with nature, Apollinaire emphasized the failure to merge, the
 unbridgeable gap between language and experience that derives from
 language's own materiality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 For him, poetry did not spring from a muse but represented a
 confrontation with difference in which the intellect struggles to
 understand not the image itself but what it means to perceive an image
 and to register that perception in language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his early poetry, then, Apollinaire was already pursuing a relation to
the natural object which artists like Picasso would teach him so much more
about, one in which the object is not represented and yet also does not
disappear entirely from view. Pursued at the highest levels where they
become self-conscious activities, both poetic language and pictorial art
reflect an indeterminacy from which artistic creativity springs. Yet if
Picasso's painting is not about revealing the object in nature but about
revealing material that allows for the creative search for the object,
about <I>his own</I> interconnected processes of perception, memory,
and presentation, then what can it mean to say that "it is the social
function of great poets and artists to renew continually the appearance
nature has for the eyes of men"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 If creative works do not share common objects or subjects, if our
 language is fully enclosed within our own experiences, memories, and
 creative acts, which are <I>sui generis</I>, how is social

<B></B>

communication of any sort possible? A Picasso painting may be likened
to a statement, but it is difficult to see how it could be clarified by
a counter statement or opened to questioning. Apollinaire's answer, I
want to suggest, is that the avant-garde work of art must be conceived
as a performance, as an effort to influence that its audience can accept
or reject but that it cannot directly engage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If avant-garde works of art are performances, then the public sphere
in which they are presented is one of agonistic exchange rather than
mutual dialogue. This idea ought not to sound strange. In our own
world of sound-bites and thirty-second television spots, a performance
politics based on analogous logic reigns supreme and, indeed, testifies
to Apollinaire's historical perspicacity. Yet the difference between the
two worlds is at least as important as what they share. Our performance
politics is ultimately quantitative and linked to a conception of value
in exchange, while Apollinaire imagined a performance politics governed
by a claim of taste, of artistic genius, through which the audience would
be led to a greater appreciation of the qualitative dimension of life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's fullest articulation of his concept of
avant-garde performance is found in the <I>M&eacute;ditations
Esth&eacute;tiques</I>. Here he argues that, unlike the traditional
artist who finds inspiration in a purposive natural world which he then
mimics, the avant-garde artist recognizes the world, in both its natural
and social dimensions, as fundamentally without purpose: "The rainbow is
bent, the seasons quiver, the crowds push on to death, science undoes
and remakes what already exists, whole worlds disappear forever from
our understanding, our mobile images repeat themselves, or revive their
vagueness, and the colors, the odors, and the sounds to which we are
sensitive astonish us, then disappear from nature--all to no purpose"
(<I>CP</I>, 9). Yet, for avant-garde artists, the fact that no divine
order inheres in the world as given, that "no muse inspires them," is
no impediment to art but rather its source. Like Nietzsche's "active
nihilist," Apollinaire's avant-garde artist responds to a meaningless
world by forging "his own divinity"(<I>CP</I>, 10). This "divinity" makes
him "master" of the creative process, freeing him from any subservience
to the creative acts of forces outside himself. But it also has two more
specific effects. As Apollinaire writes of Picasso: "A new man, the world
is his new representation. He enumerates the elements, the details, with
a brutality which is also able to be gracious. New-born, <I>he orders
the universe in accordance with his personal requirements, and so as to
facilitate his relations with his fellows"</I> (<I>CP</I>, 23, emphasis
added). In its freedom to deal with "elements" and "details" in terms
of the "personal requirements" of the artist, avant-garde performance
presents a world that is unique, that discloses a personality, that is
therefore qualitative, concerned with the status of the unreproducible
particular, and completely foreign to what is merely "fashionable"
(<I>CP</I>, 11). Yet, in Apollinaire's view, the best avant-garde
performance is able not only to reconnect with the concrete experience of
life but also to communicate that experience to others. Art "facilitates
his relation with his fellows" in the sense that "the picture which he
offers to the admiration of men will confer upon them, likewise, the
glory of exercising their divinity--if only for a moment" (<I>CP</I>,10).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In speaking of divinity, then, Apollinaire appears to refer to the
absolute freedom to create, which in turn implies the presentation of
a personal world powerful enough to reconnect individuals in a mass
society with the qualitative dimension otherwise missing from their
existences. And by becoming divine in this sense, the avant-garde artist
rescues modern society from nihilism and meaningless repetition.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Without poets, without artists, men would soon weary of nature's
monotony. The sublime idea men have of the universe would collapse
with dizzying speed. The order which we find in nature, and which is
only an effect of art, would at once vanish. Everything would break up
in chaos. There would be no seasons, no civilization, no thought, no
humanity; even life would give way, and the impotent void would reign
everywhere (<I>CP</I>, 14-15).
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With such artists, on the other hand, the experience of the qualitative
reawakens: thought, humanity, order, and the sublime all once again
become possible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To anyone who reads Apollinaire's day-to-day art criticism, however,
this happy vision of avant-garde and public marching hand-in-hand
toward a respiritualization of the world must appear problematic. For
it is precisely the critic's function to mediate this relationship, one
that, by itself, is made distant by an uncomprehending public mired in
the quantitative and commodified, as well as by the solitariness of the
avant-garde's quest for an autonomous art. In his criticism, Apollinaire
refers constantly to this distance and, though he rarely reflects on
the critic's task <I>per se</I>, his practice suggests that he does not
regard it as an avant-garde performance in itself but as a promotional
and educational activity. It is notable that, unlike avant-garde critics
such as Marinetti, Apollinaire does not write manifestoes. Rather his
preferred presentational modes are the exhibit review and the brief
programmatic treatise for the exhibit catalog. His other characteristic
forms of critical writing--art news, freestanding interpretations of
individual artists, promotional and self-promotional blurbs, and polemics
against rival critics--confirm the impression that their primary aim is
to create the public that avant-garde art requires.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire sees the public sphere as a complex field of positions
including, most saliently for him, artists, critics and the press,
salon juries and judges, artist organizations, dealers and gallery
owners, and the public at large. His own critical practice takes each
of them into account, now chastising a gallery owner for "deliberately
under-representing" C&eacute;zanne or being overly preoccupied
with the "taste of the moment," then needling the "gentlemen of the
(judging) committee" for their "intellectual poverty," or supporting
"young painters" against the "venomous spirit in our art critics," or
commending the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Ind&eacute;pendents for the
growth in its membership.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Yet, in every encounter, his unwavering goal is to reduce the distance
 between the most talented and sophisticated artists and their potential
 public, and to do so in clear language accessible to as broad a public
 as possible. "Henri Matisse, whom so many uninformed viewers find
 disconcerting, is an extremely appealing painter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Or: "People will also admire Albert Gleizes's <I>Fishing Boats</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Such sentences are typical of a practice in which Apollinaire approaches
 the public alternately

<B></B>

as tour guide, investment adviser, or technical expert and connoisseur,
but always with the aim of quickening their appreciation of the
performance before them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire conceives his mission as defending the art he considers most
meritorious and tasteful; thus he advocated cubism even though he was
not particularly excited by it. In this sense, his criticism seeks to
be educational as well as promotional, and he sometimes appears almost
professorial, doling out grades to some artists ("Mme. Lewitska's
landscapes of Roussillon are solid and full of poetry. . . . Lhote,
who is improving markedly . . . Frank Burty who is also improving
. . . Delaunay is one of the most gifted and most audacious artists of
his generation"), while scolding others for being beholden to motives
(like "profit") inappropriate in the pursuit of pure art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Despite his high regard for the French, he treats France as a country
 in which philistinism predominates but of which he is self-appointed
 eradicator. He hopes particularly to educate youth: "It seems to me a
 must to visit the Salon d'Automne; fathers will do well to take their
 sons there, both from a pedagogical and humanitarian point of view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, despite Apollinaire's very evident seriousness of purpose, the
jocular spirit for which he was so well known constantly broke through,
making him an educator at least as attached to humorism as he was to
logical forms of persuasion. Thus, to promote "women's writing," he
wrote a year's worth of columns for Montfort's <I>Les Marges</I> under
the signature of "Louise Lalanne" before first having Montfort announce
that Louise had been abducted by a cavalry officer and then finally
revealing her true identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Later, during the war, when he was assigned to translate news reports
 from the English press for <I>Paris-Journal</I>, he seems to have
 "translated" entirely from his own imagination, pointing out that
 "there is no better way to influence events."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Such playfulness carried over as well into some of his attitudes about
 art. Thus, he commended plagiarism as an activity in which "so many great
 men have engaged" and shrugged aside the idea that there was anything to
 be concerned about in artistic "fakes." Here he commended the attitude
 of the German curators who, he claimed, "instead of lamenting the fact
 [of a fake] and transporting the work to the attic . . . simply place the
 little word <I>'nach'</I> ('in the manner of') before the artist's name."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's tricksterism, however, was not merely a matter of personal
style. It also reflected his awareness that humorist appeals, so commonly
exploited by the rising industries of mass entertainment, would help to
provide him with the widest possible audience. Like the naturists and
others reacting against the hermeticism of the symbolist generation,
Apollinaire was never content with limiting the reach of avant-garde
art to an elite public. He knew that the capacity of avant-garde art
to make an impact on the problems of modern life--commodification,
industrialization, uglification--depended upon its ability to address
a broad public. And he knew that to address a broad public, neither
avant-garde performance itself nor the critics who mediated it could
afford to isolate themselves from the sort of appeals that mass culture
deployed. In practice, the three components of his model of the public
sphere--agonistic performance by an avant-garde, its mediation by
critics, and its reception by a broadly democratic public--were all
mutually interdependent.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No attitude comes through more strongly in Apollinaire's art criticism
than his receptivity to mass culture. The modern world had become a place
where we are "surrounded by ugliness on every side. We allow horrible
buses to disre the streets of Paris without protest, and our houses
are the ugliest possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Whatever can be done to enhance the beauty of the lived environment is
 of benefit, whether that means the paintings of a Matisse hanging in a
 left-bank gallery or the advertising posters of a Jules Cher&eacute;t
 which have so "ennobled the art of street decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Apollinaire wrote frequently on the decorative arts, and he could
 appreciate an electric chandelier with bulbs made to look like sea
 urchins as much as a new avant-garde talent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 He thought inventive commercial applications of the arts not only
 beautified the environment but provided the masses with a taste of
 art, one that might lead them closer to avant-garde works. Thus a cheap
 reproduction of Seurat's <I>Circus</I> had its place, and popularized
 books on the designs of the "great masters" might even encourage their
 readers to find their way to a museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Apollinaire's attitude towards the mixing of art and commerce was often
 playful and without a sense of threat, as when he amused himself with
 imaginary conversations about dress shops exhibiting at the next Salon
 d'Automne.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Avant-garde painting needs a "great marketplace," and whatever stimulates
 art generally will help provide it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 A frequenter of the M&eacute;drano Circus all his life, Apollinaire
 foresaw a future rapprochement between circus and theater in an interview
 during the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 As editor of the journal <I>Les Soir&eacute;es de Paris</I>, he showed
 an avid interest in mass culture, even publishing an article about
 American baseball.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Cinema too excited him immensely, and <I>Les Soir&eacute;es</I> featured
 a regular column on it by Maurice Raynal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Apollinaire's enthusiasm for mass culture was not blind. He approved
of it so long as it contributed to the dissemination of artistic taste to
a wider audience, but his attitude became disapproving when standards of
taste were greatly weakened or lost. He was particularly harsh when he
thought avant-gardists were surrendering to popular appeal rather than
excellence as the ultimate arbiter of their success. The Futurists, for
example, sometimes succumbed to a "popular, flashy art," and he thought
Marinetti's ideas on variety theater courted "the danger . . . of falling
into that refined half-heartedness, poor and pretentious, half-Munich and
half-Salon-de-Automne, which is the most obnoxious kitsch [<I>pompier</I>]
there is today" ("le danger . . . de tomber dans cette ti&eacute;deur
raffin&eacute;e, pauvre et pr&eacute;tentieuse, mimunichoise, mi-Salon
d'automne, qui est bien ce qu'il y a des plus odieusement <I>pompier</I>
de nos jours").
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Such avant-garde performances were no longer primarily governed by
 claims of taste but had, despite their own intentions, subordinated
 themselves to the principle of exchange value.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is, then, in Apollinaire's conception of a modern public sphere,
a delicate and ultimately precarious balance. As the fullest expression
of the search for art's autonomous essence, avant-garde performance is
modernity's best hope for getting back in touch with the qualitative
dimensions of existence that lie beyond exchange. And such performance
is itself quintessentially modern, growing out of the same ingenuity
and imagination that have produced modern industry and technology. In

<B></B>

this sense, avant-garde art and mass culture are continuous with one
another, each an expression of the aesthetic potentials of modern life,
which are very great. "Modern style," Apollinaire wrote in 1912, lies
above all in "its iron constructions, machines, automobiles, bicycles,
and airplanes," and he who sees in the Eiffel Tower a "lack of style"
is quite mistaken ("le style moderne . . . les constructions de fer,
les machines, les automobiles, les bicyclettes, les a&eacute;roplanes
. . . manque de style.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Two decades before Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, Apollinaire
 was calling attention to the democratic potential of the work of art
 in an age of "mechanical processes," even while also expressing the
 fear that the "industrialization" of art might ultimately seduce the
 avant-garde from its pursuit of a pure art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 That was of course the other side of the balance. Market forces
 pressured younger painters to produce too much and too soon, and a
 market-stimulated "art of the boulevards" was threatening to undermine
 the avant-garde from within.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 His anger at this potential even led Apollinaire into the occasional
 anti-Semitic remark, as when he wrote of Heinrich Heine as "a Jew who
 tried to gallicize himself, and unfortunately it is this caustic Jewish
 spirit that has managed in large measure to replace the simplicity of
 the French spirit; the art of the boulevards is Jewish to the point
 of excess."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Embedded within this unfortunate display of rancor, however, lies an
important point, one that will play a central role in "The New Spirit
and the Poets," his most important late essay. For Apollinaire, the
main antidote to the collapse of avant-garde values before the demons
of exchange was the naturist principle that genuine art must be rooted
in the concrete national conditions of a people. So long as avant-garde
art remained connected to folk traditions, customs, specific locales,
and the life circumstances of a particular people, its anchoring
in the qualitative appeared secure. But when, as with many of the
Futurists, it lost touch with its roots in a vain quest for an avant-garde
internationalism or notoriety for its own sake, it was prone to seduction
by the quantitative and abstract despite its own best intentions.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one notable exception to Apollinaire's lack of interest
in writing manifestos: the brief Futurist manifesto he wrote in the
spring of 1913 that appeared in the Florentine journal <I>Lacerba</I>
that September.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Yet even this is not quite the exception that it initially appears to
 be. From the first Parisian exhibit of the Futurist painters at the
 Bernheim-Jeune gallery in February 1912, Apollinaire had been lukewarm
 toward the Milanese movement, claiming that they were "nothing but
 imitators . . . of the avant-garde French schools."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Though this view provoked the hostility of some Futurists, especially
 Umberto Boccioni, Marinetti himself recognized the immense value of
 having Apollinaire in his corner and reacted more strategically. Through
 pressure on Ardengo Soffici, a Florentine Futurist who had known
 Apollinaire from a long sojourn in Paris, Marinetti seems to have teased
 Apollinaire into writing a Futurist manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Yet, according to the later recollections of Carlo

<B></B>

Carr&agrave;, when Marinetti received the manuscript, he judged it
interesting but not yet written in manifesto form. The elaborate font
and typeface variations of the version that appeared in <I>Lacerba</I>
were Marinetti's work, though they met with Apollinaire's approval.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ironically, the one Futurist influence upon Apollinaire that seems
incontrovertible are Marinetti's ideas about typography, punctuation, and
visuality in poetry. On more substantive matters, however, Apollinaire
was critical of Futurism both before and after the brief parenthesis
represented by his manifesto. The reasons for this attitude are not
hard to discern. As already indicated, Apollinaire feared that Futurism
was insufficiently serious about artistic values and too given to the
fashionable. Futurism also seems to have especially provoked his anxieties
about being French; nearly all of his articles on the movement treat
it in the context of a Franco-Italian avant-garde rivalry. Apollinaire
clearly reacted against Marinetti's autocratic leadership style, as
would the Florentine Futurists in the spring of 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Yet Apollinaire also had deeper reasons for being cool towards Futurism,
 reasons connected with his ideas about an avant-garde strategy adequate
 to modern innovations in culture and communication.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Marinetti, the modern world was veering decisively away from written
persuasion, especially in extended forms like the book, and toward the
visual, cinematic, and verbal-performative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Accordingly, the fundamental form of his avant-garde practice
 was the Futurist "evening" (<I>serata</I>) in which written poetry
 became only a means within a staged performance that drew its energy
 from a calculatedly hostile relation with its audience. In contrast,
 Apollinaire jealously guarded the specificity of the literary, defending
 the written page and the book against obsolescence and against being
 reduced to its present, performative value, even as he sought to push
 writing in a more visual direction. This attitude was linked with
 a view of language which, as we have seen, remained analytical and
 intellectualistic in its insistence upon its own artificiality and
 separation from experience. Language for Apollinaire was a critical
 instrument for investigating the difference and otherness of the
 confronted object rather than, as in Marinetti, a medium through
 which human bodies and the world were to be ecstatically merged. To
 follow Marinetti's irrationalist and apparently world-transforming
 understanding of language, Apollinaire feared, was actually to
 return art to a traditional-mimetic understanding rather than a
 modernist-autonomous one. As he wrote in the <I>Soir&eacute;es</I>,
 "Marinetti's words-in-freedom [<I>mots en libert&eacute;</I>] bring
 about a renewal of description and as such they have their importance,
 but they also imply an offensive return of description and are in this
 sense didactic and anti-lyrical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to some critics, however, Apollinaire's enthusiastic, sometimes
ecstatic response to the war represented a movement back toward Futurism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 This is a view we will consider--after we have briefly enumerated the
 essentials of that experience. As a foreign-born resident of France,
 Apollinaire was under no obligation to enlist. He could have gone to
 Switzerland, as some friends suggested, or to New York with artists like
 Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Albert Gleizes, or he could simply

<B></B>

have stayed in Paris as Picasso did. For reasons that should by now
be evident, however, Apollinaire made immediate efforts to join the
French army. Initially, these efforts failed because of his Polish
name, his mother's Russian birth, his own Roman birth, and the fact
that, despite his French nationalism, he had not troubled to apply
to become a naturalized citizen until just a few months before the
outbreak of conflict. Ultimately, however, the army's need for
manpower prevailed. By December he had joined the 38th regiment
of field artillery at N&icirc;mes, and by April 1915 he was at the
front. There he mostly remained until a shell splinter penetrated his
tin helmet on March 17, 1916, eight days after finally being granted
French citizenship. Apparently superficial at first, his head wound soon
proved otherwise, temporarily paralyzing his left hand and forearm and
putting so much pressure on his brain that the army doctors ordered him
to be trepanned.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During his months of combat, Apollinaire wrote a number of poems--notably
"Merveille de la guerre," "La petite auto," "Fus&eacute;e," and
"A l'Italie"--that appear to celebrate the butchery of war and to
aestheticize the experience of it in a manner not unlike Marinetti's. "Ah,
Dieu, que la guerre est jolie" is the most often cited line of his
war poetry and, not infrequently, it serves to end as well as to begin
discussion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Yet the most thoughtful interpreters have tended to reach the same,
 obvious conclusion. As Matthews poignantly argues, "certainly it is
 impossible to ignore that Apollinaire poems exist that are difficult
 to read other than as attempts to establish dominance, whether real or
 imaginary," that are "expressions of a desire for power, for a willful
 suppression of difference," and that "move at will from concrete to
 imaginary, experience to creativity, image to myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 I regard this as a harsh assessment, but I have no reason to quarrel
 with it. That the war may have caused Apollinaire to lose touch with his
 critical faculties temporarily, as Matthews intimates, seems readily
 explicable in view of Apollinaire's intense desire to prove himself
 fully French. And, as Kenneth Silver has argued, pressures on everyone
 living in France to be accounted fully loyal to the war effort were
 the decisive feature of cultural experience in these years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But was Apollinaire's reveling in war a function of a renewed
Futurism? Here Matthews's answer seems ultimately uncertain, but that
of Raymond Jean is not. Jean argues that the shock of the war threw
Apollinaire into a crisis of identity so deep that he lost all rational
control over his faculties. In his view, the "counter-ideology" of
ethnic fantasy and exile that had permeated Apollinaire's poetry from
the beginning was an escape, a refusal to confront the likes of Duhamel
in rational argument, and an unconscious flight into myth that marked a
profound alienation. The shock of the war so intensified this alienation
that he was no longer able to accept the involvement of individual
existence in history, a primal refusal that Jean finds expressed in
Apollinaire's Futurist "antimanifesto" where it speaks of a "suppression
of history." Yet why should the fantasies of ethnicity and exile that
inhabit Apollinaire's poetry be treated as an escape from historical
responsibility? Jean appears to assume that the only appropriate
response to Duhamel's racist xenophobia would have been an assertion of
cosmopolitanism and that any counter-nationalism must be an irrational

<B></B>

escape. As has been argued in this paper, however, Apollinaire was a
French nationalist from the beginning for reasons very much bound up with
his attraction to naturism. From this point of view, his enthusiasm for
the war is explicable as the full blossoming of attitudes he had always
held. To believe that his attitude towards the war requires some special
explanation is to fail to recognize the depth both of his own prewar
nationalism and of the nationalist tendencies of the prewar French
avant-garde as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That Apollinaire's hearty embrace of the war was not a function of any
return to Futurism is also evident from the argument of "The New Spirit
and the Poets," which he delivered as a lecture in November 1917 and
which was published posthumously in the <I>Mercure de France</I> of 1
December 1918. The crisply written essay is a brilliant synthesis of
his value commitments, his view of public life, his sense of the coming
transformations in culture and technology that will affect that life,
and his understanding of the historical role avant-gardes must continue
to enact.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From its opening sentence, which touts France as the world's
cultural center, the essay rings with nationalist rhetoric. "The
strong intellectual discipline which the French have always imposed on
themselves" will save them from the "excesses of the Italian and Russian
Futurists." Yet Apollinaire's argument for the importance of national
rootedness pertains to every nationality, not just the French. "Truth,"
he claims, must be explored "as much in the ethnic domain . . . as in
that of the imagination." He also proclaims his confidence that "social
developments will [never] go so far that one will not be able to speak
of national literature," a formulation that seems driven as much by his
fear of global cultural forces as by his dispassionate analysis of the
present. Indeed, he goes so far as to say that "art <I>increasingly</I>
has a country;" he explicitly rejects cosmopolitanism; and he emphasizes
the old naturist principle that "poets must always express a milieu, a
nation," that artists are always the "expression of a race, of one given
environment. Art will only cease being national the day that the whole
universe, living in the same climate, in houses built in the same style,
speaks the same language with the same accent--that is to say never."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Case closed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire knows full well that the "old regime" has expired on the
battlefield and that "the new spirit" whose outlines he is trying to
discern is linked to rising forces of cultural democratization, globalism,
and technology. Yet the effect of these realizations is mostly to excite
his desire for a "return to order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 The values he declares are rational and orderly: "The new spirit which
 is making itself heard strives above all to inherit from the classics a
 good sound sense, a sure critical spirit, perspectives on the universe
 and on the soul of man, and the sense of duty which lays bare our
 feelings and limits or rather contains their manifestations." The
 trick will be to integrate these values with the modern technical
 prowess that the Futurists so celebrate and the importance of which he
 certainly acknowledges too. "Typographical artifices," for example,
 "have the advantage of bringing to life a visual lyricism which was
 almost unknown before our age." Ours is the "era of the telephone, the
 wireless, and aviation," and the "popular art <I>par excellence</I>"
 is the cinema. Poets will respond with enthusiasm. "They want to be
 the first to provide a totally new lyricism for these new

<B></B>

means of expression which are giving impetus to art--the phonograph
and the cinema." Yet the exciting potential of these modern technical
triumphs is sharply distinguished from the moral values the Futurists
associate with them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The essay prefers to speak of "new spirit" and "poets" rather than
avant-gardism and avant-garde, but it is clear that, despite its
return-to-order tenor and opposition to Futurist values, Apollinaire
remains committed to an agonistic public sphere based on avant-garde
performance. "Poets and artists," he <I>writes</I>, "daily increase the
patrimony of civilization; and through the truth and joy they spread, they
will make this civilization, if not adaptable to any nation whatsoever,
at least supremely agreeable to all." And: "since men must live in the
end by truths in spite of the falsehoods with which they pad them, the
poet alone sustains the life whereby humanity finds these truths." There
are signs, however, that Apollinaire is moving toward a more democratic
notion of the avant-garde. Like Antonio Gramsci who responded to the
postwar era by declaring that everyone is an intellectual, Apollinaire
declares that "one can be a poet in any field: it is enough that one
be adventuresome and pursue any new discovery." Poets are all those
who "undertake discoveries." They "are not simply men devoted to the
beautiful. They are also and especially devoted to truth, insofar as the
unknown can be penetrated, so much that the unexpected, the surprising,
is one of the principal sources of poetry today."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the nearly three years between his head wound and his death from
influenza, Apollinaire lived his life in tune with this same balance
of values. He wrote the program notes for Paris's major avant-garde
performance of 1917, <I>Parade</I>, which featured set designs by Picasso,
music by Eric Sati, and a libretto by Jean Cocteau. In these notes, the
word surrealism appeared for the first time. He remained abreast of new
avant-garde developments like dada, and gave early, enthusiastic support
to Tristan Tzara.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Yet, at the same time, the values he articulated shifted sharply to
 the conservative side, and he began to write more explicitly political
 articles and to show new enthusiasm for Charles Maurras and Action
 Fran&ccedil;aise.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 When Tzara approached him regarding his journal <I>Dada 2</I> in
 1918, Apollinaire coldly responded that "it would be compromising
 for me . . . to collaborate on a review . . . that has Germans for
 collaborators, even if they should favor the Entente" ("il pourrait
 &ecirc;tre compromettant pour moi . . . de collaborer &agrave; une
 revue . . . qui a pour collaborateurs des Allemands, si Ententophiles
 qu'ils soient").
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Such Germanophobia had not prevented him from lecturing at the <I>Der
 Sturm</I> gallery in Berlin in 1913, but the devastation of war and
 the uncertainties of the new era that loomed before him redoubled the
 nationalist instincts that had always undergirded his thinking about
 the nature and political potential of cultural modernism.

line-by-line analysis that the content of the manifesto was almost
entirely derived from Marinetti and deserves to be thought of as only
"in minimal measure"  a work by Apollinaire.
