She was visibly very fond of and attached to “her” theatre, the Dear Conjunction Company, a Paris-based troupe which she founded in 1991 with actors Trish Kessler and Les Clack.

Partly paralyzed, she had to come to terms with the fact that the rest of her life was to be spent in a wheelchair. After staying in hospital for several months she was placed in a nursing home near Gare de l’Est. Barbara vehemently opposed the prospect of staying there indefinitely and eventually her strong will prevailed and she was able to return to her studio in Rue Seguier after it had been adapted to the needs of a handicapped person. During my visits to the nursing home as early as 2004 I started taping our conversa</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">tions about her past, something I noticed she could cope with incomparably better than with her present. Her long-term memory was intact: she could remember the smallest details concerning people met in a specific restaurant near the broadcasting studio in London back in 1959. She seemed as eloquent as before her stroke, and continued to tackle the most complex issues with great lucidity, formulating complete sentences, and frequently showing a great deal of humor. But her wit was now displayed only in reference to the past. As soon as we had finished our session, returning to the present was very hard; she seemed all the more worried and anxious. That was the price she paid for her short sojourn in the past. Another price, even higher, was the grief she felt in realizing that it was all gone and done with.

With the support of her friends James Knowlson, Anthony Gill, and Harold Pinter, she was awarded a Civil List Pension from Her Majesty the Queen, and another from the Royal Literary Fund “for her services to literature.” These allowed her to have a live-in caregiver in her small studio. Moving to her own place brought her the comfort of being able to better concentrate on “the project” of her final years, the most important in her life, as she repeatedly said, and one that was to remain far from finished: a personal memoir of Samuel Beckett, commissioned as early as the nineties by Harvill Press. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Her memoir was meant above all as testimony, as she writes in the prefatory frag</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">ment: “It was not until some years after his death in 1989, after re-reading some of the biographical and other studies, however admirable, of Beckett and his work, that I realized I was the only person who could bear witness to certain precious and unknown aspects of his being.” Its title, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Let Mortals Rejoice . . . </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">, was a reference to a tombstone inscription composed by Jonathan Swift in honor of a friend: “Let Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race.” </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:31px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">890 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">“I deliberately refrained from any Boswellian note-taking or anything of that kind, considering it completely incompatible with the nature of our relationship,” states Bray. Rather than a biography, her book was intended to be a personal reminiscence “inspired” by two quite different biographical texts.

The language is of classic simplicity—a single touch gives classic resonance to the ridiculous: “He went on and on.

BB: Of course the Haydens lived quite nearby for a long time and he used to go to dinner with them in the evenings. MK: Ussy was also a very orderly place, I mean his work quarters in the little house. BB: Very ascetic, very monastic. Sam was very methodical about everything. Very simple, no superfluities, whatever. Until he finally decided to get a TV set to watch tennis and rugby. MK: Watching tennis and rugby was a way to relax. BB: He was an athlete himself, he played rugby and tennis and all the rest, and he was interested in it. I remember watching snooker with him. In London, I remember watching Muhammed Ali with him. Because he was a boxer too. He was very interested in sport. He was interested in everything, really. You couldn’t spend your whole life writing, you couldn’t keep up burning candles so fiercely all the time. And of course he did a lot of walking. As a lot of writers have said, their best ideas come when they walk. He was a great walker. MK: What kind of programs did he watch on TV? BB: Just the games; I never saw him watch other programs. I don’t think he was interested in the news. I think he was listening to it on the radio. He was always well informed. MK: Was there a phone in Ussy?

I’m not setting this up as a literary theory but I think some people are born with a kind of eye which sees everything sort of quizzically.

The religious mystics all thought that when you got yourself down to this small center which doesn’t take in any of the worldly things but takes in the cosmos, the religious mystics think that the farther away you get from yourself the nearer you get to God. But I don’t buy that. I’ve studied the mystics a lot and I think their sense of exaltation is not because they’ve got near to something else, it’s because they’ve got away from the world. The farther away you get from the world, and worldly preoccupations and ambitions and passions—I don’t mean you can’t have them—but that state of being, that particular state of being, is not because you’ve got nearer something else, it’s because you’ve got farther away from all the petty things. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:47px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">MK: That’s why they were exalted? </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">BB: Yes, I think so.
