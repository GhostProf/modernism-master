<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p><span style="font-style:italic;">Once one has acquired the right ear and eye, one becomes restless</span>, Franz Marc </p></blockquote>
<p>Experienced by many artists as the era of private passions, devoid as such of the collective experiences necessary to the creation of "Great Art," modernity found more than once in war and revolution the propitious conditions for a salutary rupture. The majority of artists of the European avant-garde thus succumbed to the euphoria following the declaration of the First World War in 1914, in the hopes of living the powerful common experiences that the gloomy accumulation of days during peace time had seemed to deny them. Although they had previously defended their autonomy, transgressing without respite the limits defined by "tradition" and "common sense," those artists were now ready to recognize in war the "feast" of socialization, advocated once by Hegel as the necessary means for the taming of modern individualism.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> In other words, the war offered to the artist the opportunity to protect his self against its own excesses. Expecting to finish with the aporias inherent in the "autonomy of art," he desired to merge in the anonymity of the people.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged today that if the Great War accomplished this anonymity, it was in a radically different way than the one hoped for by artists: not simply interdependent, factories and armies became almost interchangeable in their means of production and in their ways of using workers and soldiers' labour power. Just as it was impossible for a worker to have a total vision of the industrial productive process, for individuals  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> participating in battles it had become impossible to perceive the army's plan. The first deception that the war provoked in Max Beckmann was therefore the oppression of his individuality, which he had until then considered to be his most precious capital as an artist.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In a manner similar to George Grosz, Ludwig Meidner, and Ludwig Kirchner, Beckmann would thereafter reject the industrial war for its capacity to multiply horror.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, other artists' reactions to the war do not fall under the purview of such a disillusioned humanism. They were interested in the spirit or method of war rather than in its immediate effects. Despite their crucial differences, the Cubist Fernand Léger, the Expressionist Franz Marc, and the Italian Futurists belong to this general framework. No trace of the horror of war can be detected in their texts or war sketches: instead of focusing on the "inhuman" effects of the war, these artists paid attention to its capacity to abstract the human. Even though all of them recognized in the war's "methodological" abstraction the confirmation and objectification of their previous aesthetic battles, a clear distinction can be made between those who, like Léger, speculated about the war in a rationalist way, analyzing its principles and drawing appropriate conclusions for the future of their art, and those who, like Marc and the Futurists, lived the abstraction of the war in total empathy.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> This empathy, defined here as the subject's identification with the virtual object of its representation, produced ultimately the transration and, even, sacralization of the war. The war was sometimes sacralized in itself, as the climax of a transcendental experience, and sometimes as the means to accelerate the manifestation of the sacred.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge conceived his landscape painting (<span style="font-style:italic;">Landschafterey</span>) as the anticipation of a new religion, purer and more abstract than Protestantism, which was itself already purer and more abstract than Catholicism; he momentarily imagined a war able to accelerate, by its purifying effects, the irruption of this new religion. Nonetheless, he soon confronted the tenacious inadequacy dividing modern forms of war and religion. In a letter to his brother Daniel written in 1802, the painter explains: "I once imagined a war able to turn the whole world upside down and the way that such a war could come, but since war was becoming a science everywhere in the world and no war was fair any more, I did not see any other means than the advent of the Last Judgment, when the earth will open to swallow up all of us."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> In Runge's view, the increasing rationalization of war was incompatible with any mystical effect. Secularized history could not assume the eschatological function that the artist still preferred to attribute to a transcendental Last Judgment, striking down human beings from above. One century later, however, it became clear to the sociologist Max Weber that war was the only situation where the bureaucratic State, ordinarily accomplishing its tasks in an impersonal and impassive way, could challenge religious ethics. In giving a meaning to what was strictly arbitrary, death itself, war was able to rouse in nations the spirit of sacrifice that only religious vocations or experiences of communion with God had been able to produce until then.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This thesis would be confirmed by the Great War, whose mystical character was praised—at least during its first months—by many intellectuals and artists. Roger Caillois analyzes this phenomenon in several essays and, especially, in his book entitled  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Bellone ou la pente de la guerre</span>. In contrast to Runge, Caillois insists on the infallible symmetry between modern war's emancipation of the human, resulting from its radical rationalization, and its increasing sacralization: "Nothing can be felt as sacred", he writes, "that cannot appear to man as completely alien to his own nature."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The essential inhumanity of the sacred to which Caillois refers was valid in regard to the avant-gardes, who justified their formal abstractions before the war as the only expressive means appropriate to reveal the divine. The avant-gardes in Germany and Italy were ideologically prepared both to sacralize and aestheticize the First World War<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup>. The fact that the war experience of numerous artists was characterized by an exact equivalence between the aesthetic and the sacred was due to the common apocalyptic structure of these two aspects, so much so that it is impossible to grasp the logic of the mystical war without considering the re of the "Apocalypse." The notion of "Apocalypse" corresponds to a polyvalent metaphor; it is a complex construction, interlocking aesthetics, politics and religiosity, the subjective and voluntarist quest for religion in modern times. Since this notion determined artistic ideologies before the war, the avant-gardes were ready to invest in the idea of an "apocalyptic war," a conceptual conjunction that had seemed so terribly incongruous a century before to the Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Declining the Metaphor of Nature</h1>
<p>For the avant-gardes, war had started before the war. Despite the crucial differences among the several avant-garde trends, their common target was nature or reality: during the five years prior to the outbreak of the war, their discourse presented nature under several facets, all of which were interdependent. Material and passive, devoid as such of any original productive spirit, nature was above all a "woman."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> "Nature" included globally the concept of "accumulation": the accumulation of natural formations—<span style="font-style:italic;">natura naturata</span>—or of fabricated objects, issued from the continuous production of capitalism. Nonetheless, accumulation also referred to the addition of artistic forms of the past. In this case, it denoted tradition and, to a greater extent, its parody: eclecticism. The influential anarchist essayist Ludwig Rubiner, for instance, an ethical and political model for Hans Pfemfert, the editor of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>, asserts that "capitalism is not simply a state; it is an attitude. The exploitation of everything that exists in the world and that does not come from ourselves. In art, this attitude is hidden behind the concepts of 'tradition' and 'style'."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> From a temporal point of view, the avant-gardes rejected the mere accumulation of moments or events, in which they recognized linear, mechanical time. They also abhorred cyclical time, inscribed in daily labour as well as in the implacable repetition of the manifestations of nature. In regard to the past, accumulation as a macro-temporality signified historicism, and in regard to the future it signified blind, automatic evolutionism.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, the avant-gardes, from Kandinsky to the Futurists and the Expressionist Activists, were most often defiant of and even hostile to democratic representation, social democracy, and Marxist materialism. While parliaments had removed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from the historical subject its capacity for direct action and produced what was only an apparent democracy, social democracy cancelled out the notion of revolution by transforming it into an evolutionist reformism. For the majority of artists, parliamentary democracy and social democracy corresponded to a kind of "political mimesis": they were limited to the political reproduction of the already existing. A social-democratic adept was thus ultimately the political equivalent of a Naturalist painter. One of the most striking expressions of this equivalence between art and politics was given by the activist <span style="font-style:italic;">Literat</span> Kurt Hiller. Speaking in indistinct terms borrowed from artistic imitation and parliamentary democracy, these "sheer descriptions" as he qualified them,<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Hiller affirms: "Description is nothing; the elaboration of norms (<span style="font-style:italic;">Normation</span>) is everything; we want to change, improve, help. We do not think nor feel psychologically; we think and feel politically."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Marxist materialism was rejected for its determinism, disqualified as a product of scientific rationalism simply transferred from the field of natural sciences to the field of history. Moreover, the avant-gardes had a mediocre idea of the proletariat: its materialism seemed to them symmetrical to the materialism of the bourgeoisie. All in all, these facets of the real—spatial and temporal, aesthetic and political—were founded on the naive conviction that nature, reality, or the milieu was capable of engendering its own change. Nevertheless, as Kurt Pinthus claims, they could only achieve their mere reproduction. The editor of the well-known Expressionist anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Menschendämmerung</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Twilight of Humanity</span>) , affirms after the end of the war: "Man calls reality (<span style="font-style:italic;">Wirklichkeit</span> everything that exists outside him, around him and before him. He takes as 'real reality' nature and its manifestations [ … ]. He takes as reality the human past, History, whose he considers to be the last link. He takes as reality all the constellations and arrangements that he has created (State, economy, social order) so that he can be relieved of the burden of life."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> According to Pinthus, however, "Man can only be saved by man, and not by his environment."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> This is the reason why the avant-gardes had decided to produce a new aesthetic, historical, and political reality by means of what seemed to them to be their exclusive instrument, namely the spirit.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Typology of the Apocalyptic Model: Rupture/Interval, Action/Waiting</h1>
<p>In the book he dedicated in 1922 to the Anabaptist Thomas Münzer, the philosopher Ernst Bloch asserts that "the apocalyptic irruption shatters the over-abundance of history."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Many artists and writers' investment in the re of the Apocalypse was due to its radical rupture of a time saturated by history, as well as to the dialectics of catastrophe and utopia inherent in the Apocalypse since the days of Jewish messianism.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The Apocalypse of the artists was one of the res of modernity's secularization process. Its catastrophic and utopian action was supposed to emanate from subjectivity. The radical subjectivism of the avant-gardes was founded on the idea of an"interiority," either individual or collective, capable of applying its law to exterior reality. Despite the fact that the spiritualism and, more generally, the idealism of the avant-gardes blurred the boundaries between the political and the religious, one can hypothesize that their  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> apocalyptic utopias became manifest <span style="font-style:italic;">globally</span> in two major forms and according to two different temporalities: the Apocalypse with a social and political vocation, inspired by revolution and expected, as such, to take the form of a radical rupture; and the Apocalypse which maintained its religious vocation, conceived this time as a progressive revelation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Geist</span>, whose accomplishment would put an end to the materialist era. Apocalyptic revolution presupposed the voluntarist and activist attitude of the subject, while the "religious" apocalypse was indebted to the concept of "waiting": not for the Messiah, but for the ripening of time, for the realization of history's potential.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Political Ruptures</h1>
<p>The analysis of Futurists and Expressionists' activist works and discourse outlines the type of apocalyptic revolution that they envisioned; mainly of anarchist origin, it is in other words opposed to parliamentarianism, social-democratic reformism, and Marxism. The critic Carl Einstein, for instance, an important member of the Expressionist circle around <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>, did not indulge in the "democratic compromise," which constituted the main target of his text "Politische Anmerkungen" (Political notes) .<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> He qualifies this compromise as "acrobatic," for it mainly consisted in the "neutralization" and the "dialectical resolution" of oppositions. To the re of the "dialectician" Einstein opposes the "univocal man" (<span style="font-style:italic;">eindeutig Mensch</span>), ideally capable of combining "form and violence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Form und Gewalt</span>) in his "primitive" action. Parliamentary decrees are, according to Einstein, the illusory resolutions of conflicts, while he praises what he calls the "univocal" for its "unparliamentary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">unparlementarisch</span>) character and its capacity to be "always identical to the construction of its Idea."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Parliamentarianism's aesthetic corollary was, for the critic, the optical atomization, the indecision and passivity of Impressionist pictures. Einstein opposes the idea of a wilful art, capable of mastering the energy of the spirit by means of a solid form. In another text called simply "Das Gesetz" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Law)</span> , he describes the ideal process of both artistic and political action: the subject is expected to apply in both matters its own "Law," the "manifestation of transcendental formations" and of "powerful will." Law is autonomous and, as such, determined by a "real arbitrariness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Willkür</span>)<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup>. This subjective arbitrariness should characterize both political and aesthetic action. Ludwig Rubiner goes to greater lengths to establish this equivalence between the artistic and the political: in praising the efficiency of the representational action of the poet and the painter, he makes them into the paradigmatic res of the activist man. Endowed with "Intensity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Intensität</span>)—a Bergsonian notion that the writer explains quite vaguely as "the conscious action of spirit"<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> —artists are able to "transform inner images into facts"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> and to replace the actual forms of reality by "space (created) from within."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> In other words, there is no mediation, no qualitative transition between art and reality: plastic forms are converted into political actions, and reality is submitted to the formative power of the subject in the same way as the pictorial surface. The link between art and reality is "re-presentation": forms and actions are the exteriorizations or spatializations of subjective representations. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>If Rubiner does not explain the concrete manner in which forms can be converted into actions, Italian Futurists do. Not simply equivalent or analogical, forms and actions have a rationalized and, more precisely, an instrumental relation. Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo, and Carlo Carrà count on the action of the image's motor forces on the spectator: as a perceptive equivalent of the political realm, the suggestive image is at the same time its model and its instrument. The solidification of impressionist "ambivalence" by the "force-lines" and "force-forms" was a model for the organization of the amorphous masses during the Revolution.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Russolo's painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolt (</span>1911) comes naturally to mind when one reads the following lines from the manifesto "The Exhibitors to the Public" written in 1912: "With the desire to intensify the aesthetic emotions by blending, so to speak, the painted canvas with the soul of the spectator, we have declared that the latter, '<span style="font-style:italic;">must in the future be placed in the center of the picture</span>.' He shall not be present at, but participate in the action. If we paint the phases of a riot, the crowd battling with uplifted fists and the noisy onslaughts of cavalry are translated upon the canvas in sheaves of lines corresponding with all the conflicting forces, following the general law of violence of the picture. The force-lines must encircle and involve the spectator so that he will in a manner be forced to struggle himself with the persons in the picture."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, the differences between the politically engaged Expressionists and the Futurists were at least as important as their commonalities. If the latter understood as literal the violence that the artistic form was supposed to tame in order better to propagate it, the Expressionists understood it in its ideal sense. One of the main influences on Futurism was exercised by the ideas of Georges Sorel on violence, while it was Piotr Kropotkin, Gustav Landauer, Erich Mühsam and other pacifist anarchists who determined the political conceptions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In this regard, the nationalist bellicism of the Italian artists was the opposite of the cosmopolitan pacifism of the Germans. The latter, passably Christian in their majority, were also heavily influenced by Tolstoy, who, beyond his anarchistic convictions, also believed very firmly in the contagious character of art. Nevertheless, neither Tolstoy nor his German followers aspired to exploit the contagious capacities of art for the propagation of violence, but aimed at its elimination.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> In short, unlike the Sorelian revolution, the revolution of the Expressionist activists was pacifist, and, unlike the Marxist revolution, it was ideal.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite their differences, all these different revolutions—the Sorelian, the Marxist, and the Expressionist—shared an apocalyptic character.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The Expressionist revolution of the Idea in particular was supposed to emanate from the subject in an immediate, voluntary, and imperative way. One of the main themes in the political writings of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> is the rejection of the passive, messianic <span style="font-style:italic;">expectation</span>. Carl Einstein ironically deplores the fact that liberal democracy succeeded in rationalizing even "catastrophes," and Ludwig Rubiner explains that the main element that differentiates "Spirit" from <span style="font-style:italic;">Zivilisation</span> is its imperviousness to any kind of evolutionism. Spirit's ontological regime is exclusively "catastrophic." "Ideas are always there, and they are always new," Rubiner argues: "And every Idea is a catastrophe."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As to Futurists, their reaction was similar to that of other anarcho-syndicalists in Italy. Zeev Sternhell has explained more than once the ways in which the anti-materialist and anti-rationalist revision of Marxism in Europe was able to attribute to the war the function they formerly attributed to revolution.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> From 1910 on, Marinetti and Boccioni progressively adopted the revolutionary nationalism of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">La Lupa</span>.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Since the revolution was "moral" in its intentions, and certainly not economic, the war turned out to be the ideal baptismal field for the moulding of virtues such as courage, the ascetic renouncement of one's self, and so forth. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Guerrapittura</span>, conceived and published during the war, Carlo Carrà writes: "War or revolution, both purifying, both invigorating."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Later, when Futurism became one of the main components of fascism, Marinetti evokes very simply the "revolutionary war," guided by "a minority of intellectuals." "They were the best, the least imbued by tradition, the most Futurist. While the whole population was still immersed in the inertia of pacifism, they understood the need for the war."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Religious Interval: Between the "Already" and the "Not Yet"</h1>
<p>The works and essays of the artists who associated their activity with the destiny of religion put forward the idea of the Apocalypse as a progressive, secular <span style="font-style:italic;">Revelatio</span> of the Spirit. Politics as such was not so important in the case of Vassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc; for them, the dystopias of their time were essentially a matter of religious defectiveness.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> It was this defectiveness that was about to end: "Today art is moving in a direction toward which our fathers would never even have dreamed. One stands before the new works as in a dream and hears the horsemen of the Apocalypse in the air. An artistic tension is felt all over Europe. Everywhere new artists are greeting each other."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> In the prospectus of the Almanach of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blaue Reiter</span>, authored by Marc, geographical universalism becomes a translation of historical determinism. In being an expression of History's will, new painting even draws its legitimizing metaphors from "nature": as Marc argues, new art crosses the borders of nations in the same arbitrary and thus undeniably objective way that grains are spread by the wind.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> His painting's universalism is as strong as the implacable determinism of natural laws: this is the sole positive reference to "blind" nature that Franz Marc allows himself. In any case, the historical identity of the era is one of tension between the materialism that was coming to an end and the progressive revelation of the "Great Spiritual." Artistic tension, of which the <span style="font-style:italic;">Almanach</span> is a testimony in itself, was the anticipatory and condensed manifestation of this more global, but still latent, historical tension. The attitudes of Marc and Kandinsky towards history comprised waiting, interval, and distance: they believed the apocalyptic "revelation" to be progressive and immanent in history, even if they thought that they accelerated its realization by their works. They were living <span style="font-style:italic;">already</span> what was not there <span style="font-style:italic;">yet</span>: the incarnation of the spiritual in art reproduced, in short, the tensions and contradictions of the dogma of the Incarnation of God in Christ. Karl Löwith formulates this tension very subtly: "The times are already accomplished, but they are not completed yet. The time which separates the Resurrection of Christ  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from his Return is irrevocably the last one; but it is also, as long as it lasts, the last but one time which precedes the accomplishment of the kingdom of Christ, present but still secret, in the form of the manifested kingdom of the Father."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Antilogical Principle: From the Apocalyptic <span style="font-style:italic;">Istoria</span> to the Apocalyptic Form</h1>
<p>The Expressionist logic was grounded in the concept of a more or less radical "dissociation" between external and internal reality, matter and spirit, or the organic and the abstract. Like all the painters who worked on abstraction, Vassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc exhausted the consequences of the idea according to which nature's truth was hidden behind its appearances: the further pictorial forms were from the forms of nature, the better painting revealed the latter's (abstract) essence. Logical contradiction prevailed here: the more two objects seemed dissimilar, the more they were in fact similar. In the first letter he addressed to the composer Arnold Schönberg in January 18, 1911, Kandinsky qualifies his artistic conception as "antilogical." Elsewhere, in a great number of his essays, he raises "dissonance" to the level of the central notion of the pictorial and musical composition.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Contrast, contradiction, antilogical, dissonance: all these notions are susceptible to being joined in the concept of the "Apocalypse." Expressionist aesthetics can thus be interpreted as an entirely apocalyptic aesthetics, and the conception of abstraction as "Revelation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ent-hüllung</span>) of the hidden is not the sole reason for this equation.</p>
<p>It is widely known that in the years during which Kandinsky elaborated on abstraction, he was also obsessed with the themes of the Apocalypse and the Last Judgement. An important change took place in his paintings during those years: Apocalypse passed progressively from the status of <span style="font-style:italic;">istoria</span> to that of <span style="font-style:italic;">form</span>.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Kandinsky's apocalyptic "feeling" was progressively interiorized by and assimilated into the "hidden construction" of forms and colors. The historical tension of the times was translated into the contrasting relations among plastic elements and it was spatialized in the tense convexity of space common in Expressionist paintings.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>The vertical size of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Last Judgment</span>, a painting of 1910, is rather uncommon in the artist's production; the Apocalypse is signified here by a big trumpet, cutting the composition diagonally, but also by the citadel on the top of the "triangle," evoking the celestial Jerusalem and the Merezkovskian Moscow as the Third Rome.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Through their strictly iconological character, these attributes construct the apocalyptic <span style="font-style:italic;">istoria</span>. At the same time, however, they are completed in their action by the signifying function of the formal elements themselves, which are considerably dissociated from their objective referent. More precisely, the dissonant sounds of the trumpet are not only suggested by the kneeling re putting her fingers over her ears, but also by the highly contrasting colours and, above all, by the vibrating, trembling, and shaken space. This tense space, whose center is about to blow up, looks as if it was shaken by the shrill sounds of the apocalyptic trumpet. At the same time, the spots of colour express by their dilated and dissolving character the dematerialization and evaporation of sounds in the air.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Ultimately, the de-objectification of the plastic elements signifies the de-objectification of the world that the Apocalypse is supposed to initiate. Not only does colour overflow the outline of objects, but the pictorial surface is also stretched like skin, or rather like a woman's belly hiding a new life. A double and apparently contradictory, gendered conception of the work of art determines Kandinsky's thought: the feminine function of pregnancy and the masculine function of the spectator's fertilization. In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Spiritual in Art</span>, the artist affirms: "The art which does not enclose in itself any future potential and which is thus a child of its times will never engender the future: it is a castrated art."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In spite of this, the ambivalent gender of Kandinsky's paintings was not contradictory: conceived either as a pregnant woman or as a generating male, its target was in both cases the spiritual fertilization of the spectator. In a similar way to the process of "<span style="font-style:italic;">imitatio Christi</span>," the spectator was expected to interiorize the "apocalyptic" image and operate his own "revelation."</p>

</div>
<p>A similar apocalyptic function of form, grounded in "alogism" or "transrationality" (<span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span>), was inherent in Russian Cubo-Futurism. For those poets and painters the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> non-objective world was a "worldbackwards" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Mirskontsa</span>): this is also the title of a poetic anthology that includes poems by Aleksei Kruchenykh and Velimir Khlebnikov as well as drawings by Nataliya Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov and Vladimir Tatlin.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> The "worldbackwards" or the world "turned topsy-turvy," as the poet Helena Guro states in a poem, did not respect the cognitive and perceptive conventions of logocentrism.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> It found its expression in z<span style="font-style:italic;">aum</span> poetry, going from the transgression of syntactic rules to the combination of simple phonemes, and in the illogical juxtaposition of objects and forms in paintings and collages. However, "worldbackwards" was also the verbal or pictorial translation of apocalyptic time "counted backwards." The notion of "Zero," extremely important for the Russian avant-gardes, also included the time "Zero," the very moment of apocalyptic irruption and spiritual revelation: this was exactly the story of Malevitch's <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span>, the famous "zero of forms."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Retrospectively, the painter situated the first appearance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span> in a certain eclipse of the sun: in the canvas of the Third act of the Futurist opera <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory over the Sun</span> . The temporal tension of the Apocalypse was spatially translated in the diagonal division of the image, composed by the half of an absence—the disappearance of the naturalist sun—and the half of a presence—the progressive revelation of the spirit emanating from subjectivity.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Subjectivity's victory over nature is celebrated at the end of the opera in the following lines: "The world may fall but we shall have no end."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Judgment of Art</h1>
<p>Nonetheless, the intention of all the artists who had chosen to shock the public by the unusual formal identity of their works was ultimately for its greater benefit. Before the First World War painting was healing by hurting, and this was undoubtedly its major apocalyptic quality. There is no battle in the paintings of Kandinsky without peace at its horizon, no tragedy without serenity, and no poison without an antidote. During an ethnographical survey of Siberia, this former jurist understood the meaning of popular oral law: "absolute crime does not exist", he asserted; "it is not action (the real), but its root (the abstract) which does good or harms. And finally: every action is indifferent."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In other words, while the apparent effect of Kandinsky's abstract compositions was to shock the spectator's ordinary perception, their "hidden" intention was destined to reveal the spirit to him. One could go even further and apply the antilogical rule here: the more a composition was aggressive toward perception, the more it was beneficial to ethics. The same presuppositions and intentions, in a deliberately aggressive and provocative version, determine Futurist art.</p>
<p>The transition from the symbolization of the end of the world to what we can call the "final form" was remarkably presented by the Russian philosopher Nicolai Berdjaev, who was very attentive to modern art. In his text <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis of Art</span> published in 1918, Berdjaev plays with the semantic ambivalence of the term "crisis," designating at the same time the notion of the (last) Judgement and the uncertain manifold state of tensions and conflicts.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> He was convinced that Crisis had stricken the body of art long before it irrupted within History in the form of War. Berdjaev first observed the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> omnipresence of the apocalyptic theme in Russian Symbolism and later in the painting of the avant-gardes. He pointed out an important change in their approach. According to the Symbolist conception, Symbolist artists such as Čiurlionis, Ivanov, or Scriabin adopted an additive approach to the theme of the End of Times: they added "spirit" and symbolic meanings to material forms, at the risk of oppressing and suffocating the latter (something much like the Hegelian "bad infinite"). In opposition to this additive approach, the Cubist, Futurist, and Suprematist painters proceeded by subtracting the "skin" or "envelope" of bodies: new painting was thus a process of disincarnation or disembodiment. It was on this account, moreover, that Berdjaev recognized in the war the historical realization of the new painting. In a manner similar to most of the painters upon whose works he commented, the philosopher also dissociated the exterior from the interior, the organic from the abstract. In this way he was able to identify in the industrial war the envelope of the spiritual one: "In cosmic life indeed a spiritual war is being waged and a struggle made for the greatest values. And only by the spiritual war can mankind and the nations be saved for a new life. The material warfare is but a manifesting forth of the spiritual warfare."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> In keeping with what happened before the war in the Cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso or in the Futurist canvases, wherein the human re was submitted to an increasing representational dematerialization, historical man was also losing his cultural envelope during the war and reaching a core that Berdjaev called "barbarity." Berdjaev wondered if this barbarity would turn out to be a new beginning or an end. One could ask: was war inaugurating a post-history or a kind of second prehistory? It was probably this ambivalent post-and pre-historic barbarity that struck the philosopher in the paintings of Picasso located in Moscow such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>  or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dryad</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nude in the Forest</span>) .</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Mystics of the "Despite" and those of the "Because": The Apocalyptic War</h1>
<p>When the war broke up in August of 1914, it fit like a glove on artists' apocalyptic imaginary. Even if all of them did not celebrate the outbreak of violence, the great majority agreed that the latter represented something similar to the "messianic pains," also called the "pains of giving birth," that ancient rabbis had seen in the torments of the Apocalypse.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> For Roger Caillois, the myth of the war as delivery was one of the aspects that contributed to its sacralization in the second half of the nineteenth century. One could add that this generative quality attributed to war was precisely the result of its preliminary conception as an Apocalypse. Transred in the "pains of giving birth," the torments of the war became not only tolerable, but sometimes even desirable.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> This graduation from the "tolerable" to the "desirable" may help to distinguish among different mystical reactions to the war. Certain artists such as Kandinsky as well as the politically engaged Expressionist Literati rejected the war in itself, but could not avoid seeing in it a mediation, a kind of crossing point from the critical past to the accomplished future. Others, however, such as Marc and the Futurists, celebrated the war as a welcome moment endowed with a unique, exclusive, and purifying capacity.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> In other words, the mysticism of the war had its moderate and its radical disciples, its disciples of the "despite" and those of the "because."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Antilogical War</h1>
<p>Kandinsky and Rubiner, who sincerely abhorred violence, rejected the war when they judged it in itself, but hoped that future peace would be superior to the former one. This was a question of perspective. To Franz Marc, who affirmed to Kandinsky that "I live myself <span style="font-style:italic;">in this war</span>. I see in it a salutary, even cruel way which leads us to the goal. This war will not be a regression for humanity, but it will serve to cleanse Europe, to make her ready," Kandinsky answered: "I thought that to construct the future we had to clean the place in another manner. The price of this way of cleansing is horrible."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In other words, despite his own previous arguments about external and internal law, "every action" was not indifferent for Kandinsky. Nonetheless, what counted most for him was the "root" of each action. Of course, the "root" for this modern man was not a stump lying in the past, but the predetermined meaning of History expected to be realized in the future. Even if Kandinsky would certainly have preferred a cleansing of the reality of his times without the shedding of a single drop of blood, he was tempted to cast his gaze away from the horrible present and turn it towards the future. In sum, the antilogical principle remained valid throughout: the more the sacrifice during the war was horrible and inacceptable, the more legitimate seemed the hopes of the artist. "What a happiness it will be," Kandinsky confided to Klee shortly after the beginning of the war, "when this horrible era will have ended. What will come afterwards? A great bursting out, I think, of the purest forces, which will also lead to fraternization. And at the same time, a great blooming of art, which for the time being has to remain hidden in dark corners."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>The interpretation of the war by the intellectuals and artists around <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> did not differ substantially from Kandinsky's. They refused to serve their homeland as soldiers, they waged war against war and continually transgressed censure, but they also hoped that the advent of the socialist community would be accelerated by the war, as if this latter became an involuntary accomplice of the expectations of these authors. For these convinced anti-materialists, the war was also a "messianic pain": as an action of the Antichrist (the capital, nationalism, and so forth), the war proclaimed the Kingdom of One Thousand Years. The anti-materialist determination of their political conception led them to find an indirectly positive effect of the war. It is no less true—Eva Kolinski has remarkably shown it in her study on the politics of German Expressionism—that the ambition of these people to play the role of social guides pushed them to anticipate the context propitious for the exercise of this role.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> A new world was urgently needed. Henceforth, the conception of a spiritual pacifist avant-garde, opposed to the military ones, haunted the writings of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> during the war. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Abstraction of the Concrete, Empathy with the Abstract: Marc's War</h1>
<p>As for Franz Marc, he blamed the perspectivist reaction of his ancient accomplice, Vassily Kandinsky, on the war. To the latter's attitude of filtering and mediation, he opposed his own full, immediate participation. Nonetheless, although Franz Marc participated in the war as a soldier and even lost his life to it, the question that needs to be asked is if this Expressionist painter was after all capable of participating in any kind of concrete common experience. The Expressionist war was ultimately incompatible with any participatory attitude.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>To be specific, immediate, common war was completely different from Marc's <span style="font-style:italic;">own</span> war, such as it was expressed in both his drawings and writings. The reason is that as a soldier, Marc adopted his previous attitude as an anti-naturalist artist: "From the very first moments of the war," he confessed to his wife, "all my reflections were concentrated on the effort to isolate the spirit of this moment from the unfurling pandemonium. I put my fingers on my ears and I tried to see behind the phantom of the war … The thinker flees the face of things, for the reason that they are never what they appear to be."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> If the war did not transform Marc into a naturalist, it was because the artist succeeded in detaching himself from precise events and actions as well as in abstracting himself from war's materialist grounds. He was able to live in empathy with war's "hidden" meaning. Detached from the "impressionist" history of events and from the materialist history of causes, the Expressionist painter was able to live in empathy with his own philosophy of history and his own religion.</p>
<p>War's considerable technical dematerialization favoured Marc's transring crossing of appearances. He elaborates this in his own terms: "In any case, this war does not make of me a naturalist, on the contrary, I feel so strongly the spirit hovering above battles, the spirit omnipresent behind every bullet, that the real, the material totally disappears. The battles, the wounds, all movement produce such an effect of mysticism, of irreality, as if they signified something radically different from the meaning of their names."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> The artist could thus recognize retrospectively the anticipation of the war in his painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Fate of Animals</span> , where he expresses, in the middle of nature's destruction, the voluntary sacrifice of the deer.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Similarly, his non-realistic perception of the war was represented in his war sketches: his two drawings called <span style="font-style:italic;">Streit</span> (Conflict) as well as the one called <span style="font-style:italic;">Zaubriger Moment</span> (Magical Moment), all centrifugally composed, transre the material explosion by transforming it into the ecstatic bursting of the world of appearances.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>Every mystical reading of the war functions in fact as a Christian parable. It presupposes the dissociation between appearance and essence or between deed and meaning. The Existentialist philosopher Jan Patočka distinguishes between the "diurnal motives" of the war and the sublime experience that it offered to those who were able to attain its metaphysical meaning. Relying on the mystical accounts of Ernst Jünger or Teilhard de Chardin, Patočka affirms: "The diurnal motives that have raised the will of war are wasting away in the furnace of the front, when the war experience turns out to be profound enough for not succumbing once more to the forces of the day  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> … The everyday, as well as every image of life to come, fades away when confronted with this nude summit on which man has now placed himself."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> In the same way, Franz Marc does not describe any battle in his letters: his inner world had thoroughly replaced common reality. He was not interested in the feelings that this shared reality provoked in his fellows: he was convinced that men were executing the will of History as if they were automatons. Being the only one "awake" among somnambulists, the Expressionist artist sometimes identified in the war the Judgment of History and sometimes a necessary surgical operation. In both cases, what was at stake was a radical "cut": the cut of time, with all the harmful ideas and deeds it contained. Since Schiller and Hegel, the metaphor of the Judgment of History, secularizing the theme of the Last Judgment, has been well founded in occidental thought.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> The judgment of Franz Marc, evaluating according to the "hidden meaning" of the war, considered henceforth that the relentless aesthetical and spiritual battles he had engaged in before the war with his friends were premature, voluntarist, merely subjective. Rejecting all <span style="font-style:italic;">avant</span>—or <span style="font-style:italic;">arrière</span>—garde, he was able to dream that at the end of the war People and artists would be at last synchronous.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>As a "surgeon," the war was supposed to excise the "ill members" of Europe. Even if Franz Marc pretended that the latter did not correspond necessarily to geographical frontiers, but to transnational social and cultural groups, he did attribute a special spiritual value to Germany, his own country<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup>. Also, the war was endowed with certain magical qualities. In this case, it was expected to exorcize excess by its own excess. The prodigality of destruction, the sacrificial expense that Marc mentions very often in his war writings, was equal to the historicist accumulation against which he had always fought. Beyond this neutralizing function, however, sacrificial expense was also expected to reach the core of nature: "Nature does not count the pennies", Marc argued<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup>. In other words, the sacrificial generosity was the reversed image of the utilitarian exploitation of nature and the narrow, mean bourgeois spirit. In sum, Franz Marc invested his resources of empathy on abstract war, to the point that his non-contemporaneity with his contemporaries—his temporal interval with his times—shrank more and more, until it was completely absorbed. During the first months of mystical optimism, the future stood in for the present; later though, when Marc came to believe that the war was despite everything a materialist business, he did not come back to History, but continued to cross the spatial and temporal appearances until he reached what he called, echoing Schopenhauer, an "Indian atemporality."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Futurist Artificial Optimism</h1>
<p>The empathy of the Futurists with the war was entirely different from Marc's, conditioned as it was by their Bergsonian conviction that "<span style="font-style:italic;">la vie déborde l'intelligence</span>, which is to say that it overflows, swamps, and suffocates the infinitesimally small faculty of intelligence."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> According to this, Futurists were ideologically predisposed to construct a war experience that united the spiritual and the physiological.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> They rejected every kind of intellectualism, of which Boccioni and Marinetti rarely forgot to underline the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> supposed "German origin." In regard to art, they believed that the shaking of the spirit could only be reached through the shaking of the body; in regard to politics, Marinetti and Carrà attacked the intellectualism inherent in internationalist and pacifist socialism, to which they opposed the spontaneous and energetic action of the nationalized masses.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Futurists affirmed in their writings that these two vitalist conceptions of art and revolution converged naturally within war, the aesthetic and political qualities of which they praised. Of course, the question that arises is: how do we come to know the extent to which vitalist spontaneity and energetic courage were compatible with the war's technological means? The reasons for such a contradiction are conceptually productive and the historian has to work on the gap between values and facts.</p>
<p>Futurists went beyond the modernist assertion according to which artists were predisposed, by virtue of their transgressive attitude, to announce wars and revolutions.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> Marinetti had elaborated an interesting chiasmus of metaphors: Futurism represented "the militarization of innovative artists" and war was, inversely, "Futurism intensified."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> What did this intensification mean, exactly? War proved to hold a force of acceleration more efficient than the one attributed to revolution before the onset of the war. It was expected to destroy the parliamentary parody and tear bourgeois contracts to pieces. Of course, the Futurist intensification of the war meant above all the latter's aestheticization, set forth each time that Marinetti praised the synaesthesic, quasi Wagnerian spectacle of battles. Moreover, the aesthetics of the war rested on its "disinterested" character: if Marinetti insisted on the notions of sacrifice and heroism, it was because their common "disinterested" essence transformed them into eminent aesthetic qualities. It is well known that Walter Benjamin explored this aspect of "disinterested contemplation" of the war in his theorization of the aestheticization of politics in Futurism and Fascism. Before his essay on art (1935–6), it was in his recession of the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Krieg und Krieger</span> (War and Warrior), edited by Ernst Jünger in 1930, that he broached this subject. To explain the idealization and sacralization of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> (war experience), he writes: "The most rabidly decadent origins of this new theory of war are emblazoned on their foreheads: it is nothing other than an uninhibited translation of the principles of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art pour l'art</span> to the war itself."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Nonetheless, writers such as Andrew Hewitt, Jeffrey Schnapp and Mark Antliff have underlined the inadequacy existing between Benjamin's Kantian, contemplative interpretation of the aesthetics of war and the highly energetic and active function assumed by the latter in various anti-democratic ideologies of those years.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Christine Poggi, on the other hand, recently recognized the constituent moment of Futurism in the process of conversion of symbolist pessimism to what Marinetti called "artificial optimism": this conversion is probably the most appropriate thread to grasp in an effort to untangle the complex landscape of the Futurist aesthetics of politics.</p>
<p>If 1914 was a "Futurist Year," it was because, as Marinetti said, "Today, we are seeing an immense Futurist exhibition of aggressive, dynamic canvases, one we wish to engage in so as to reveal our qualities."<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> A war which unfolds as an "immense Futurist exhibition" is of course an aestheticized war. A war in which we want to engage "so as to reveal our qualities," however, is a realized aesthetics. The difference between Decadentism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and Futurism is situated exactly in this inversion. While the Wagnerian contemplation of battles is an amplification of Decadentist aestheticism, the moulding of "new men" in the trenches has something resolutely avant-gardist about it. The aesthetic contemplation of the war remained, in principle, considerably passive: it had not broken with the "chronic pessimism" that Marinetti identifies accusingly in his writings. His own concept of "artificial optimism" found a happy outlet in what the poet calls the "cruel and violent realism" of war.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> The war would "revive," "accelerate," and "sharpen" the intelligence and nerves of its agents. In other words, the war's agents were expected to be the artists of their own selves. As several historians have argued, this fabrication of a new, invulnerable subjectivity was the most important stake of Futurism.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Art was both the laboratory and the instrument of a new, invulnerable subjectivity, where the effects of the dissolving forces of the milieu—either natural or artificial—had already been tested on the object. After the disintegrating simultaneism and the interpenetration of bodies in painting, Depero and Balla conceived a new, consolidated object named the "plastic complex." This new object was no longer subjected to the laws of nature; it was the product of an "artificial optimism," of the need to deal with and tame the dissolving forces of the milieu. Penned by the two artists in 1915, the manifesto <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurist Reconstruction of the Universe</span> contains an astonishing formulation of this intention: "The inventor of words-in-freedom Marinetti, to whom we showed our first plastic complexes, had told us with a great enthusiasm: art, before us, was a remembrance, the anguished evocation of the lost object (happiness, love, landscape), that is why it was nostalgia, statism, pain, distance. With futurism, on the contrary, art becomes art-action, which means will, optimism, aggression, possession, penetration, joy, brutal reality in art (for instance: onomatopoeia; bruitors = motors), geometric splendour of forces, projection ahead. So art becomes Presence, New Object, new reality created with the abstract elements of the universe. The hands of the passeist artists were suffering for the lost object, our hands were trembling with anxiety for the new object to create."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> The plastic complexes of Balla and Depero were assemblages <span style="font-style:italic;">avant la lettre</span>, fabricated with various materials and endowed with movement. The two Futurists were convinced that this sensorial multiplicity and objectness liberated them from the "trap" of representation, doomed to be, through its mediated character, an endless "mourning" of the lost object. Eric Michaud argues that the subjective decision to adopt and furiously extend the destructive work of reality through the conversion of the passive loss of the loved object to its active and perfectly deliberate destruction was fundamental to the avant-gardes in general and to Futurism in particular. Following the analysis of Sigmund Freud, Michaud theorizes the mechanism of melancholy's conversion to mania inherent in several moments of modern art.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> For Futurists, the "New Object" was a metaphor of the "New Subject," called to put an end to the narrow, psychological "I" and to the mourning of its lost certainties. As the "plastic complex," the New Subject was to be an artificial formation - the formation of its own "artificial optimism." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Inner Victories, Social Defeats</h1>
<p>In his luminous critique of the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Krieg und Krieger</span>, Benjamin claims that the mystical interpretations of the war in Germany, followed by the mystical interpretations in 1918 of the defeat and of the Revolution, contributed to the formation and consolidation of Fascism. When they had not participated directly in its development, as it was the case with Futurists in Italy and Ernst Jünger in Germany, the several mystical interpretations of history had at least inhibited, through their idealism, material(ist) awareness. According to Benjamin, this awareness was indispensable to the t against Fascism. The philosopher points out an interesting paradox: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span>, although praised for its radical and baptismal character, was always presented in an abstract and hollow manner. The hyperbolic style expressed the ontological nothingness of the sublime experience of the trenches. Being nothing concrete in itself, having no materiality of its own, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> turned out to be nothing and everything. In standing independently from any kind of historicity—for instance, the historicity inherent in the technical modes of the production of war—, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> of Ernst Jünger could pretend that it had known the war <span style="font-style:italic;">in itself</span>, both primitive and eternal. It is exactly the same mechanism of erasing history in favour of ideology that commanded the Futurist <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span>. In this regard, the contradiction between the vitalist praise of the body in battle and the real conditions of the industrial war, imposing its demate-rializing effects on this same body, is very telling. The same contradiction can also be detected between Futurist discourse and image, since many synthetic visions of the war, be it Marinetti's or Carrà's, which were influenced by maps and aerophotography and combined abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">parole in libertà</span> with abstract forms, translated the condensed, rational spirit of the war that left so little place for personal initiative and engagement.</p>
<p>After the German defeat and the outbreak of social violence, few Expressionists were ready to revisit their previous idealism. Much more receptive to Marxism, Pfemfert and Einstein adopted henceforth a strongly materialist criticism of the political and social situation in Germany. The majority of Expressionists—writers, painters and architects—adopted an attitude that in all probability no one describes better than Walter Benjamin: "To have waged war out of their innermost existence is something that other peoples could claim to have done. But to have lost a war out of their innermost existence, this they cannot claim. What is special about the present and latest stage in the controversy over the war, which has convulsed Germany since 1919, is the novel assertion that it is precisely this loss of the war that is characteristically German."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> The "specifically German" characteristic was not a substantial quality but a concrete historical reaction, namely "the effort to pervert the German defeat into an inner victory by means of confessions of guilt which were hysterically elevated to the universally human. This political position, which supplied the manifestoes for the course of the decline of the West, faithfully reflected the German 'revolution' made by the Expressionist avant-garde."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> Architectural utopias' message of universal peace, Expressionists' Christian call for love, Bauhaus' criticism of the demonic effects of mechanism: these are only some of the reactions that aimed not only to neutralize but  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> also to reverse the dynamic of German defeat.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> The question of knowing whether or not German architects and artists would have adopted the same critical and negative vision of the machine if they had won the war is certainly absurd as an anecdote, but it is meaningful and suggestive in its virtual and open form. Also, instead of looking for the causes of the war in Germany's economical and political structures, idealist artists and architects made of materialism the main—and even the only—event accountable for the war. Materialism was nonetheless universal and not specifically German. In other words, responsibility was not a geographical and thus a national matter, but a temporal and consequently a universal one. Responsibility was a matter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zeitgeist</span>. Even better, many artists and architects conceived of the noblest projects for the German nation: applying the well known Christian precept according to which "the last will become the first," several Expressionists, such as Walter Gropius and Bruno Taut, formulated the idea according to which the material weakness and humiliation of Germany ultimately endowed it with the reversed vocation to become spiritually rich and proud.<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> This was the sublime reversal that Germany had to accomplish.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>The same idealist attitude was reserved for the Revolution. Once more, the Expressionists were interested neither in the struggle of classes nor in the struggle of political parties. Of course the murder by the extreme right, on behalf of the social-democrats, of left-wing res such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, had sensitized a lot of painters and architects. Nonetheless, the latter still considered that all parties were equally responsible for what Gropius called "the German catastrophe" (meaning the national defeat and the social revolution). To the political revolution, which they found fatally anchored in the contradictions and inadequacies of matter, Expressionist artists opposed again and again their own "spiritual" revolution.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Bruno Taut and Walter Gropius could thus imagine mystical cathedrals. The atemporality of their utopias contrasted sharply with the conflicts of their era. Each time they drew a utopian temple, the two Expressionist architects expressed their ambition to realize the sacred union of the German People. This time, it was not by the means of war, but by the means of art.</p>

On the reception of this idea in Germany, see Klaus Vondung, "World History is the Last Judgment," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Apocalypse in Germany</span> (Columbia/London: University of Missuri Press, 2000), 106–119.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f64" href="#f64-text">64. </a>Most of the predominantly German historians who have worked on Marc emphasize the notion of the Zeitgeist at the expense of that of "soil." Klaus Lankheit, Andreas Hünecke, and others have thus tried to protect Franz Marc from the nationalist accusation that his writings suggest. One should observe, however, that in a manner similar to the majority of avant-garde artists the Zeitgeist and the Volksgeist were equally important for Marc. With regard to the war, Marc of course considered  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that the main rupture to be expected was one between the materialist past and the spiritual future. Still, for him it was Germany—not France and much less England—who was able to lead the whole of Europe through this process. On this tension between nationalism and internationalism in Marc's thought in particular and in Expressionism in general, see Maria Stavrinaki, "Le prédicat selon Marc. De l'ensauvagement à l'ascèse."</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f69" href="#f69-text">69. </a>"In the last thirty years, Europe has been plagued by a revolting socialistic intellectualism that is antipatriotic and internationalist, which separates the body from the spirit and which dreams of a stupid enlargement of the brain. It teaches forgiveness against offenses, proclaiming universal peace and the disappearance of war, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">horrors</span> would be replaced by wars of ideas. It was against this intellectualism, which was Germanic in origin, that Futurism hurled itself, exalting instinct, strength, courage, sport, and war." Cited from F.T.
