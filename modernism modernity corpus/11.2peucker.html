"Leni! Pity she's dead," Helmut Newton says in response to the news that Leni Reifenstahl has just died at the age of 101. "She once made me promise never to call her an old Nazi, you know."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Newton, the photographer who notoriously creates scenarios of sadomasochism and perversion for the display of high fashion escaped from Berlin in 1938, having already begun his apprenticeship as a photographer there. Although Riefenstahl's photographs are not as overtly erotic as Newton's and do not appear to play to perversions, there is nevertheless a continuity between their work. It was looking at the posed, arrested bodies in Riefensthal's <i>Last ot the Nuba</i> that prompted Susan Sontag's famous meditation on Riefenstahl's films and on fascist aesthetics in general.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The fascist choreography that governs movement and stasis in Riefenstahl's work, Sontag writes in "Fascinating Fascism," "flow[s] from (and justif[ies]) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, and extravagant effort" ("FF," 40), suggesting&#x02014;though not making&#x02014;a connection between such behaviors and psychosexual dispositions. Yet the implication is there. 

<p>
Drawing in all likelihood on Wilhelm Reich's <i>Mass Psychology of Fascism</i> (written in Germany in 1933; banned by the Nazis in 1935) as well as on Adorno's "Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda," Sontag's essay points both to the sublimation of sexuality, the transformation of libidinal energies into a "spiritual" force in fascism, as well as to its expression in an "orgiastic transaction" between leader and the masses ("FF," 41; 40). It is Reich who famously claims that fascism converts the "orgasm anxiety" of the "man subjected to authority" into an eternalized purity, while Adorno draws on Freud in his assertion 


<b></b>


that the source of Hitler's libidinal power over the masses is linked to infantile orality and promotes an "archaic regression."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  "Nazi art is both prurient and idealizing," Sontag points out, its aesthetics "exalt two seemingly opposite states: egomania and servitude" ("FF," 41).

<p>
In Sontag's scattered remarks concerning the psychosexual dimension of fascist art there are lingering echoes that connect the fascist aesthetic to masochism, an aggressive, oral stage perversion that indefinitely defers orgasmic satisfaction, and that, like fascism in Saul Friedlander's reading, "aestheticizes the erotic plane."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Sontag's description of a fascist choreography as one that "alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing" ("FF," 40), calls to mind that masochism "reveals the stillness in movement, the edge of Thanatos in Eros that aestheticizes the erotic into cold suspense and diverts sexuality from orgasm to an erotic contemplation at once frustrating and pleasurable."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  By way of its <i>tableaux</i> moments and its dialectic of stasis and motion, I would suggest, the fascist choreography has a great deal to do with the theatrical scenarios of masochism. In these scenarios, eros is de-sexualized, death sexualized, and repetition and control of central importance. 

<p>
Although we will return to this subject later, the psychosexuality of Riefenstahl's choreography is not my central concern. Sontag's essay has notably pointed the way to some of the rhetorical structures that govern Riefenstahl's work, a few of which I pursue, choosing to look to one feature in particular that suggests a boundary crossing between mediums. In Riefenstahl's filmmaking, this is the recurrent presence of <i>tableau vivant</i> moments&#x02014;or, more loosely, staged <i>tableaux</i>. Kracauer was the first to call attention to the <i>tableau</i> arrangements in her films, but the term is invoked repeatedly in conjunction with Riefenstahl's style.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Sontag's description of the fascist choreography as the alternation of motion with static posing likewise draws on an understanding of <i>tableau</i> moments and of their subsequent subsumption by the ongoing flux of film's images. In the course of examining <i>tableaux</i> in Riefenstahl's films and the rhythm of movement and stasis in which they participate, my essay positions aspects of Riefenstahl's visual style within a matrix of related cultural and aesthetic phenomena. With a "thicker" description of these formal features as its object, this essay places them within other artistic practices, including the baroque tragic drama, sculpture and dance, and finally, photography. By isolating moments in Riefensthal's work that feature the posed, static body, I seek to contextualize these moments artistically and historically, and to ask questions concerning the aesthetic and ideological freight they are made to carry.

1. Triumph of the Will: Tableaux and Trionfi
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>




<p class="noIndent">
In a self-described turn away from <i>Ideologiekritik</i>, Russell Berman's 1989 essay "Written Right Across Their Faces: Leni Riefenstahl, Ernst J&#x000FC;nger, and Fascist Modernism" initially locates its interest in "the rhetorical grounding of Riefenstahl's <i>&#x000E9;noniciation"</i> and, more broadly, in a rhetorical politics of fascist representation per se.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Understanding rhetoric as expressive of a "politics prior to ideological contents," 


<b></b>


Berman clusters his brief remarks on Riefenstahl's <i>Triumph of the Will</i> around the notion of a fascist practice as one that prioritizes visual in favor of verbal representation. Using Riefensthal as a lead-in to his essay proper&#x02014;a nuanced and evocative reading of J&#x000FC;nger's work within the context of competing types of modernism&#x02014;Berman's gaze, though soon averted from Riefenstahl, continues to linger on matters of rhetorical politics. Drawing on the ekphrastic impulse in J&#x000FC;nger's writing and ringing changes on the relations of language and image that reside in ekphrasis, Berman joins his voice to others who claim that the status of writing occupies a position inferior to that of the image in fascist textual practice. Betraying a general "antipathy toward the symbolic order" ("WRAF," 110), fascist textuality as read by Berman corporealizes writing, hence reduces "the distance between body and text" ("WRAF," 109; 116). Further, fascist artistic practice favors the respatialization that occurs when the temporality of language is abandoned in favor of the image&#x02014;in this case of the ideologically-inflected <i>Gestalt</i>. Along with this reference to Rosenberg, Susan Sontag, Lessing and even Thomas Mann are not far to seek in Berman's observations. "Fascism as the aestheticization of politics transforms the world into a visual object" ("WRAF," 115): appropriately, Walter Benjamin is also pressed into service.

<p>
Simultaneously evocative of painting, drama and sculpture, <i>tableau vivant</i> generally features the immobile, held pose of human actors. <i>Tableau vivant</i> is most familiar from the fashionable novels of the nineteenth century&#x02014;preeminently Goethe's <i>Elective Affinities</i> &#x02014;where they function as a diversion, a parlor game involving the static embodiment of well-known paintings. Their origins include the <i>tableau</i> moment in the bourgeois tragedy of the eighteenth century and the staged melodrama of the nineteenth, but earlier still the term occurs in descriptions of processions and open-air festivals held during the Italian Renaissance. A widely practiced public art form during this period, <i>tableaux vivants</i> were often staged on portable platforms carrying first relics or devotional statues and eventually supporting performances of scenes by live actors.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  While early instances were religious in nature, mythological allegory later became their favored subject: the fetishized body part that is the relic is replaced first by the statue, then by the living, posed and emblematic body of allegory. On this subject, too, Walter Benjamin is well-informed: as we recall from <i>The Origins of German Tragic Drama</i> (published in 1928), the triumphal procession involving <i>tableaux</i> was favored in Italy where "the <i>trionfi</i> were the dominant mode of the processions," inspiring similar formal structures in German tragic drama.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Here, too, language is subordinate to image, and the political function of tableaux is apparent: they enact the authority of the ruler and elicit public support. Not surprisingly, such <i>tableaux</i> occurred frequently in celebrations of cultural dominance, so it is hardly surprising, as Benjamin tells us, that they flourished in Florence under the Medici (<i>OCGD</i>, 119). During the Nazi period, workers participated in <i>tableaux vivants</i> for similar reasons.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 

<p>
Surely the infamous Nuremberg party rally is such a pageant, an occasion for the public display of power, a <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, indeed. In the motorcade sequence of Riefenstahl's film, Hitler's triumphal procession features his body&#x02014;primarily stationary&#x02014;in the rigid pose of a devotional statue or mythological re, this rigidity playing 


<b></b>


a vital role in the film's myth-making program. While the motorcade and traveling camera contribute to the illusion of a moving body, the camera favors shots of Hitler erect in an open car, gliding immobile through the cheering crowd. In <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, Hitler-as-icon signifies politically&#x02014;propagandistically&#x02014;just as the statuary and <i>tableaux</i> of Venetian <i>trionfi</i> did. Here Benjamin's observation on the rhythm of the German tragic drama (the <i>Trauerspiel</i>, or "mourning-play")&#x02014;derived from these <i>trionfi&#x02014;</i>is of interest. His description of its "irregular rhythm of constant pause, the sudden change of direction, and consolidation into new rigidity" (<i>OGTD</i>, 197) is noticeably echoed in Sontag's comment on movement and stasis in the fascist choreography, specifically in the alternation "between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing" mentioned above. Riefenstahl's film establishes its irregular rhythm as fast tracking shots of the crowd are cut with Hitler as icon and ef, both the fixed point around which the action revolves and the eroticized object of the look.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This quality of an ef that Riefenstahl's film imparts to the re of Hitler is something that Hans-J&#x000FC;rgen Syberberg must have noticed.

<p>
Steve Neale, too, has commented on this film's relation to baroque drama and its particular form of display. As he remarks of <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, "theatricality&#x02014;in all its artifice&#x02014;is crucial to the particular mode of spectacle to which I am referring here, a mode whose traditions stem from, and are exemplified by, Baroque painting, theatre and opera" ("NODAS," 68). In triumphal processions as described by Benjamin, language is reduced to a "caption, conjured up from the allegorical constellations in which the res are related to one another" (<i>OGTD</i>, 196). Language as caption is emblematic and "entire speeches sound as if they properly belong beneath an allegorical engraving" (<i>OGTD</i>, 196). Following the work of an earlier scholar, Carl Horst, Benjamin suggests that language in the German tragic drama of the baroque period is similarly ornamental, its dramatic structure "hidden" beneath ornamentation, specifically <i>tableaux vivants</i> in the form of the "staged <i>exemplum</i>, staged antithesis, and staged metaphor" (<i>OGTD</i>, 192). Here, too, language is respatialized and multiply eclipsed by the image, an image whose constituent parts include human bodies whose purpose is nevertheless significatory, if opaque. 

<p>
With reference to <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, Berman points out that the priority of the image is asserted in this film even when it features a series of political speeches, claiming that "the verbal character of speech in the film is always secondary to the visual spectacle and the image of the present speaker" ("WRAF," 10). Once again language is subsumed within the greater pattern of spectacle. Given the propagandistic character of the speeches, however, what strategies reduce language to a role of secondary importance? Granted, the speakers are but one aspect of the overall design of the frame&#x02014;"beneath an allegorical engraving," as it were, beneath the emblematic Reich's eagle&#x02014;but since they are political res, well-known, even controversial, how can their individual character be suppressed? Riefensthal manages this in a variety of ways. Rudolf Hess's speech, for example, is heard in voiceover over reaction shots of listeners as varied as Goebbels, a young child, and Hitler himself. Presented from a variety of angles that heighten visual interest, these faces register Hess's words visually, 


<b></b>


affectively, as their impact on his listeners. In the montage of diatribes that follows, each speaker is preceded by a title engraved with the glowing ornamental script of his own handwriting: here, too, writing is rendered as image. Repetition likewise has its effect, de-emphasizing duration and thus spatializing language as one by one, similarly framed by the camera, the speakers deliver their speeches at the podium. By various means, then, formal procedures produce what Benjamin, quoting Horst on baroque tragic drama, has called an "advance of the plastic arts into the territory of the rhetorical arts" (<i>OGTD,</i> 177).

<p>
While Riefenstahl's use of repetition and accumulation are fascist aesthetic strategies shared in common with the German baroque tragic drama, repetition is also one of the linchpins of masochistic scenarios, where repetition produces an "aesthetic coherence" of a fantasy that expresses infantile fixation, and promotes the behaviors that defer (orgasmic) resolution. What, then, of the image of the body in this articulation? In Sacher-Masoch's <i>Venus in Furs</i>, (female) characters assume <i>tableau</i> postures, freezing&#x02014;as Deleuze notes in his study of masochism&#x02014;into postures that connect them with statues, paintings, or photographs.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Riefenstahl's film similarly has recourse to <i>tableau</i> arrangements that feature the posed body, the body in arrested motion. It is not only Hitler whose "virile posing" is suggestive of a sculpture or icon: another notable instance involves the close-up of faces in the workers' brigade, arranged in sculptural bas relief, a frieze over which the tracking camera passes. Here is the fascist merger of body and artwork that Arno Breker's and Josef Thorak's sculptures unwittingly pursue to the point of self-parody.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  It will not be necessary to rehearse the many instances in this film in which the mass ornament submits human bodies to its geometry&#x02014;Kracauer's famous essay as well as his references to the "living ornaments" of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> has provoked much observation on this topic.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<p>
But relentless movement propels Riefenstahl's film forward. Within the containment provided by the "set" of Speer's monumental architecture, Riefenstahl's orchestrated, ornamental phalanxes seem to have lives of their own, their movement throwing immobility into relief and subsuming it within its flow. As Sontag suggests, movement in the "fascist dramaturgy" traces "grandiose and rigid patterns" that sweep up the static re into its "choreography" ("FF," 40). Interestingly, nearly fifty years earlier Benjamin had used similar language to suggest to his reader that the dramaturgy of the German tragic drama, the <i>Trauerspiel,</i> unfolds "in a spatial continuum which one might describe as choreographic" (<i>OGTD</i>, 95). What are we to make of these multiple echoes of Benjamin's analysis of the <i>Trauerspiel</i> in Sontag's description of fascist aesthetics? Could it be that Sontag&#x02014;an avid reader of Benjamin who imitated Benjamin's art of quotation&#x02014;had recourse to his descriptions of tragic drama's formal characteristics and inverted their significance?<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Whether or not this is the case, in both in the <i>Trauerspiel</i> and in <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, bodies posed and contained in arrangements function as images even when they are subjected to motion.

<p>
As I have suggested, Benjaminian allegory can be said to hold sway in the <i>tableau</i> insofar as it is a mixed mode, a boundary crossing of several arts: alluding once again to Horst, Benjamin reads allegory as revealing a "crossing of the borders into a different 


<b></b>


mode" (<i>OGTD</i>, 177). <i>Tableau vivant</i> as a layering of mediums implies a transgression of organic unity in the manner of German tragic drama. In the <i>tableaux</i> scenes of tragic drama, the actor's body is arrested in motion and rendered sculptural; the allusion to, if not direct imitation of, paintings or iconographic scenes from mythology or the Bible render narrative by means of the image. Ultimately plastic, because enacted by human res, the <i>tableau</i> reduces narrative to a spectacle supported by the body. Conversely, <i>tableau</i> scenes also render the body as text, a tendency that Berman reads in the ekphrastic cast of fascist textuality.

<p>
For the German reader in particular, Lessing's preference for writing over the image is not far to seek in Berman's discussion.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  For Benjamin, however, the baroque tragic drama's allegorical tendency makes it a productively mixed mode: it is at one and the same time linguistic and imagistic, both corporeal&#x02014;tied to bodies&#x02014;and rooted in history. The Christian origins of German tragic drama allow corporeality&#x02014;Christ as man&#x02014;to guarantee both its immanence and its reflection of temporality as transitoriness. In contradistinction, Riefensthal's <i>Triumph of the Will</i> is engaged in staging history and rendering it myth. It will come as no surprise that what distinguishes the German tragic drama irrefutably from fascist art is its mode of structuration, its reliance on the fragment as the producer of meaning. If scenes of violence, cruelty, and death are so frequently represented in these plays, Benjamin suggests, it is because "the human body could be no exception to the commandment which ordered the destruction of the organic so that true meaning, as it was written and ordained, might be picked up from its fragments" (<i>OGTD</i>, 216).

<p>
As remarked above, bodies in <i>Triumph of the Will</i> are often subsumed within the ornamental patterns that characterize its style. By promoting the part only in relation to the whole, Riefenstahl's film contains and neutralizes the heterogeneity of <i>tableaux</i> moments. As Steve Neale suggests, the film's markers of theatricality do subvert its unity, they do not contribute to a self-consciousness that disrupts and critiques. They are&#x02014;on the contrary&#x02014;contained by this unity ("NODAS," 77). Needless to say, the generative principle, the anti-Eisensteinian principle of accretion that governs Riefenstahl's editing style has as its model an organic theory of art whose governing structure is wholeness. As in a kaleidoscope, patterns within this film change yet in some sense remain constant: in substituting for narrative, movement and editing merely replace one form of spectacle with another. It is the film's dynamism, then, that simulates wholeness, and the inexorability of its motion suggests that it is an erotic energy that propels the film forward. 

<p>
If it can be said of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> that it has a choreography as well as a dramaturgy, that it plays off stasis against motion, then Nietzsche's <i>Birth of Tragedy</i>  may not be far to seek. One of the texts that serves as a foil for Benjamin's treatise on the German tragic drama, Nietzsche's reading of Greek tragedy supplements the "noble simplicity and serene grandeur" that the German tradition had predominantly read in Greek antiquity from the time of Winckelmann's writings on sculpture with its opposite: a dionysian (erotic) energy. As is well-known, Nietzsche locates the dionysian aspect of Greek tragedy&#x02014;the affective urges and the dynamic principle 


<b></b>


of art&#x02014;in the chorus, in music, whereas the apollonian principle of form is allied with sculpture. Their dialectical relation opposes the (apollonian) containment of form in composed, static images with the dynamic, ecstatic (dionysian) energy of dance. In some sense, it may be the "amorous struggle" between these two principles&#x02014;to use Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's phrase&#x02014;that <i>Triumph of the Will</i> and, indeed, Riefenstahl's choreography more generally, expresses.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

2. Body Art: Sculpture and Dance
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The paradigm for German thinking concerning both sculpture and Classical antiquity famously emerges with J. J. Winckelmann's <i>Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Art in Painting and Sculpture</i>, published shortly before he left Dresden for Rome . In Dresden, Winckelmann's viewing of classical sculpture, while confined to plaster casts, nevertheless produced very vivid experiences in their spectator. The most famous of Winckelmann's meditations is centered on the Laoco&#x000F6;n sculptural group that evoked the often-cited "noble simplicity and serene grandeur" that would eventually propel much of Europe into neoclassicism. Here Winckelmann focusses on the way in which the smooth contours and the restrained pose of Laoco&#x000F6;n's sculptural body contain his pain, reading this containment as expressive of the noble Greek soul.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Winckelmann's attitude toward the physical body notably changes after his arrival in Rome, however, where his encounter with the Belvedere Apollo results in enraptured, homoerotically-tinged ekphrasis in which the spectator describes himself as transported, possessed by the beauty of the god. Despite all claims to the contrary, Winckelmann's description seems not to transcend a physical fixation on the beautiful male body. When Winckelmann is moved affectively at the sight, his experience prompts an ecstatic prose that animates and corporealizes the sculpture. Between them, Winckelmann's seminal texts suggest a spectrum of reactions to the sculptural body in which the spiritual attitude is favored, but physical response is incompletely sublimated. 

<p>
Riefensthal's first appearance in film is as Diotima in Arnold Fanck's <i>The Holy Mountain</i> , a clich&#x000E9;d amalgam of Winckelmannian neoclassicism and romantic motifs.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In Fanck's film, Diotima's dwelling place is the space where mountain cliffs drop down to meet the ocean's waves, conjuring up the Diotima of H&#x000F6;lderlin's <i>Hyperion</i> (1777-79) as well as her model, the priestess in Plato's <i>Symposium</i> whose role is to explain both the nature of love as well as the connection between the beautiful body and the ideal. In <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, Riefenstahl as Diotima expresses herself through dance as editing links her movements to the sea, the (female) element to which her pantheistic dance is dedicated. Like Venus, Diotima is seemingly born of this element and expresses its natural rhythms by way of her own. At once idealized and eroticized, Riefensthal's body participates in a narrative which moves toward&#x02014;but fails to achieve&#x02014;the formation of an ideal couple: desire for the character played by Luis Trenker, conflated with the (male) space of the sublime mountain peak, motivates Diotima's second dance. At times, the film fixes both characters in sculptural poses, backlit against 


<b></b>


the landscapes with which they are identified. Following the tradition that emerges from Winckelmann's thinking, the beautiful body is the posed body, its contours in harmonious balance, while dance and a graceful athleticism define the movement that Fanck's film demands of its characters. Expressive bodily movement and the sculptural pose continue to be central to Riefenstahl's acting in the feature films of her own directing.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 

<p>
Even more prominently, Winckelmann's ideas form a backdrop for the prologue of Riefenstahl's <i>Olympia, Part I</i> , where attitudes towards classical antiquity are re-shaped to conform to Nazi ideology, and the dialectic of movement and stasis finds an overtly political expression. In this astonishing sequence, movement develops out of stillness as classical statues are brought, Pygmalion-like, to life. Shot on location by Willy Zielke at the Poseidon Temple, the Parthenon and Ereichtheion on the Acropolis, at Cape Sunion and Corinth, and at the National Museum in Athens, it features the authentic statuary of Greek antiquity, not the plaster casts or Roman copies with which Winckelmann was familiar.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 

<p>
As usual, the choice of images and the editing were Riefenstahl's own: Zielke complained bitterly that "she did only what she had thought out at the editing table, [it was] theoretical," and that her editing style had ruined his material.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Out of material shot on location, the prologue creates the feeling that Zielke refers to as "something imaginary, it has no tempo, it is hundreds of years long, Greece, soul, mythology" (<i>LRAO</i>, 157). It is precisely this dreamlike, out-of-time representation of Greece as origin that make this prologue an ideal illustration of Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's "The Nazi Myth."

<p>
Appearing as engraved inscriptions on stone tablets, the opening credits of <i>Olympia, Part I&#x02014;</i>including the director's name&#x02014;hubristically link the art of film to the most notable achievements of Greek architecture and sculpture, providing an even more convincing example of the subsumption of writing by the image than the subverted script in the prologue to <i>Triumph of the Will</i>. What is presented here is filmic ekphrasis, with the camera visually rendering inscription for the spectator. Lyric poetry per se is thought to have originated in the ekphrastic epigrams and inscriptions collected in the Greek Anthology, poetic forms which have resonance in German writing through and beyond Rilke. Riefenstahl's film thus proclaims itself a participant in the tradition of ekphrastic writing and in the <i>paragones&#x02014;</i>or battle of the arts&#x02014;within which this genre situates itself. Although writing&#x02014;it should be noted in qualification of Berman&#x02014;usually triumphs over the image in ekphrastic poetry ("WRAF," 113-4), here the camera's writing renders the archaicized letters as embedded in the scene. Film as the art of technology emerges triumphant. From the start, then, it is suggested that pre-modern and modern modes of representation are continuous, reconciled.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
The camera's insistent and progressive motion as it generates a space around and through the ruins of classical antiquity serves symbolically to reassemble them, creating wholeness out of fragmented ruin. Larger fragments are superimposed upon smaller, and the camera's power is revealed to be formative as it progresses from a single column to the Parthenon in its entirety. The camera's constitutive function is similarly 


<b></b>


revealed as the (fascist) devices of repetition and expansion include the shooting of one object from multiple perspectives, as though to give the object shape, to present it in its three-dimensional plasticity. Since transitions between shots are in the form of dissolves, some as long as eight or ten seconds (<i>LRAO</i>, 157), the film suggests that it proceeds by way of a layering of images, by accretion rather than by means of the cuts that stress fragmentation. 

<p>
If the epilogue of Benjamin's <i>Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>, published in 1935, responds to the aestheticized politics of <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, the prologue to <i>Olympia, Part I: Festival of the Peoples</i> seems conceived to refute Benjamin's analysis and to substantiate its epilogue. Contradicting Benjamin's understanding of the cinematic medium as necessarily fragmentary, Riefensthal's prologue deliberately serves to ally film with idealist artistic practice. Fragmentation is scorned, and the evocatory power of the ruin elaborated in Benjamin's <i>Trauerspiel</i> treatise is rejected in favor of reconstruction. Both the camera's powers and the mode of editing are regenerative, bringing to life a culture that lies in ruins.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Since the bridge to that culture is created via the body, its images serve to substantiate Rosenberg's contention that the Aryan race originated with the Greeks.

<p>
Later on in the prologue, the collapsing of time and space is rendered imagistically when the Olympic torch is passed from runner to runner, its path traced on a schematic map of Europe by way of the camera, which finally descends through clouds to alight in Hitler's Olympic Stadium.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In moving from the Parthenon to the Olympic stadium in Berlin, Riefenstahl's film enacts an ellipsis that transports the spectator into a temporality it represents as mythological rather than historical. Thus Riefenstahl's prologue closely illustrates Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's elaboration of "the Nazi myth" as promoting a spatial and temporal bridge from ancient Greece&#x02014;via Winckelmann's eighteenth century&#x02014;to Nazi Germany ("TNM," 309).

<p>
Sculpture has an important role to play in the mythmaking program of the prologue: myth is a plastic fiction, a "fictioning" whose role is to propose types to be imitated, as Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy put it ("TNM," 297). After entering the Parthenon at the beginning of the prologue, the camera focuses on statues of Greek gods from multiple perspectives, its movement producing the illusion of their movement. The arrangement of the statues creates a striking depth of field, and the orchestration of the dissolves contributes to the illusion that the statues themselves are animated, seeming to move around freely as the camera tracks around the res. Enhanced by the liberal use of vaseline and smoke, the impression of movement in this sequence is nonetheless an allusion to Pygmalion, whose sculpture of the beautiful Galatea Venus brought to life.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  While filming against a dark background with a strong key light highlighting faces, Zielke created an auratic glow by means of softer and more dispersed light emanating from behind the sculptural res. Giving the impression of candlelight, this flickering lends a suggestion of motion to the statuary, calling to mind a late eighteenth-century proto-cinematic practice: the fashion for nocturnal visits to sculpture galleries that allowed spectators to enjoy the impression of "living sculptures," on whom candlelight conferred an uncanny sensation of movement.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  By this

means, too, Riefenstahl's prologue situates itself within a spectrum of received artistic tradition: it is precisely by participating in the Greek production of myth as art that Riefenstahl mimetically allies her work with Greek tradition. Here the (film) art that rehearses myth's embodiment as sculpture clearly functions as a means of identification.

<p>
The staged re-birth of myth and perfect beauty continues as a series of shots of the perfect male form&#x02014;a statue of Apollo&#x02014;is interspersed with shots of Aphrodite, the perfect female form. Images overlap and fade quickly as the two appear to move across the screen towards one another, soon to be replaced by a life-size sculpture of Discobulus, the ideal <i>human</i> form as athlete, metaphorically rendered as the offspring of the gods. But the apotheosis of Riefenstahl's regenerative strategies occurs as, with a nearly perfect match on the dissolve, a human athlete in an identical posture and against a natural setting takes its place.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Here art produces life: having enlivened the stasis of sculpture by means of its own motion, the camera now records the movements of a living human re superimposed upon the statue. As the static sculpture is released from the <i>tableau</i>, exploding into life and movement, it is suggested that the mythical past has come alive as well. By formal means, then, the prologue suggests the German claim that the experience of Greek art is that of the <i>Formwillen</i>, the will to form, and claims Rosenberg's goal of "an organic art that produces life" as the guiding principle of Riefenstahl's work ("TNM," 309).

<p>
In her memoirs, Riefenstahl represents her experience of the visual arts and dance as continuous with one another, and both are continuous with film in her artistic practice.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Indeed, the next sequence that concerns us here&#x02014;re studies of male athletes&#x02014;derives from a series of paintings of nude athletes by the American painter Stowitts, paintings much admired by Riefenstahl, who had hoped to incorporate them directly into the prologue by means of filters and out-of-focus effects.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  While these paintings themselves did not find their way into the film, their look influenced the rendering of live male athletes throwing javelins and shot-put, res characteristically shot from below. In the next sequence&#x02014;the dance sequence&#x02014;dance is not simply the female counterpart to male athleticism, but continues the meditation on movement and stasis begun earlier by the juxtaposition of camera movement with sculpture. Their arms swaying rhythmically, the women's movements are mythologically-inflected as well as "organic," in unison with the rhythms of nature, the rolling waves and the swaying grasses. This, too, is body art: at one and the same time their ornamentally-arranged bodies allude to the many-armed Aryan god Shiva and to similar patterns formed by the Tiller Girls. Once again Riefenstahl conflates pre-modern and modern references. 

<p>
Choreographed by Riefenstahl herself, the women's dances harken back to her acting debut as Diotima in Fanck's <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, where her performance is likewise cut with waves breaking on the shore.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Yet this sequence may also have been inspired by Stowitts, who was himself a dancer in the mode of Isadora Duncan (<i>LRAO</i>, 136). In this sequence, the women's dances are in the expressive style promoted by Duncan, who often performed in Greek chitons and claimed to have been schooled by "wind and wave and winged flight of bird and bee."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Since Duncan echoed her time 


<b></b>


in believing that the harmony of body and soul produce movement as the soul's "natural language," her views were compatible with the dominant German understanding of Greek antiquity as well as with Riefenstahl's ideas of dance.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Although its erotic element is not wholly repressed, dance in <i>Olympia</i>'s prologue is a far cry from its origins in dionysian rites as envisioned by Nietzsche&#x02014;yet here, too, it is connected with the natural, the communal, and religious. 

<p>
But Riefenstahl's choreography does not harken back to Isadora Duncan alone: it is synthetic, incorporating Duncan's style, yet even more indebted to that of Mary Wigman, Riefensthal's erstwhile teacher. Wigman for her part had for years been a student of Rudolf von Laban at Monte Verita in Ascona, Switzerland, where she and others performed ritualistic dances naked&#x02014;in harmony with nature&#x02014;at sunrise and sunset. It was also at Ascona that Wigman developed the ecstatic, dionysian rhythms that forged her Witch Dance (<i>Hexentanz</i>), said to have been the origin of modern dance as we know it. Further, as Riefenstahl suggests in her memoirs, Wigman's dance performances were also influenced by rhythmical gymnastics, a form of exercise closely linked to the art of sculpture&#x02014;and promoted by the Nazis.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Indeed, both Laban and Wigman had roles to play in the dance performances originally planned around the Olympics themselves. Laban as head of Goebbel's organization for German dance performance (the <i>Tanzb&#x000FC;hne</i>, or dance stage) was to orchestrate the planned Dance Olympics (<i>Tanz Olympiade</i>), in which Wigman and her troupe were to perform. Quite appropriately, one might say, Laban choreographed the planned program around themes from Nietzsche's texts, including <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  After watching the performance, however, Goebbels cancelled the program: denounced as "hostile to the state," perhaps its ideology was too explicit.

<p>
Interestingly, the dancers who performed in Riefenstahl's prologue were chosen by Willy Zielke from among students at the Laban and Wigman schools of dance in Berlin.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Read as originating in sculpture, as moving sculpture, or as a series of sculptures, dance in Riefenstahl's prologue has a relation to rhythmical gymnastics <i>(rhythmische Gymnastik</i>) that must have derived from Wigman. A form of open-air exercise much promoted in Germany during this period, rhythmical gymnastics involved the creation of dance-like exercise movements in which participants modeled their poses on Greek statuary. Originally progressive in spirit, rhythmical gymnastics was promoted during the Nazi period as an aspect of body culture (<i>K&#x000F6;rperkultur</i>): the implications of <i>K&#x000F6;rperkultur</i> and naturism for the pursuit of racial hygiene need no documentation here.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Suffice it to say that ideology of rhythmical gymnastics is consonant with that of the "Strength through Joy" (<i>Kraft durch Freude</i>)  movement, and with the Nazi emphasis on physical strength and health more generally.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 

<p>
Imitating sculptural poses is seen as an act of mimetic identification that promotes the beautiful spirit and body's espoused by the neoclassical tradition. Mimetic identification is effected through the body's pose, by means of which it physically enacts myth as embodied in sculpture.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Transitional dance movements link these poses, producing a rhythm of movement and stasis. In miming sculptural poses, the body is at once aestheticized and trained, subjected to a "theory of dressage" that also has its 


<b></b>


origins in the eighteenth century.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Sculpture is brought to life and the living body rendered periodically immobile. Not surprisingly, given the late eighteenth century's interest in proto-cinematic spectacles, another artistic practice of this period serves as a model for rhythmical gymnastics. These are Emma Hart's <i>tableau</i> performances of classical statues and res from mythology, with their erratic rhythm of bursts of motion contrasted with moments of prolonged stillness. Witnessed by Goethe during his stay in Naples, Hart's performances are described in his memoirs and no doubt served to inspire the famous <i>tableaux vivants</i> in <i>Elective Affinities</i>.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Absent from Hart's <i>tableaux</i>, of course, is the discourse of physical self-improvement: her performances are perceived as theatrical spectacles whose impact was to be spiritual&#x02014;although there is little doubt that Hart's performances also produced a pornographic effect upon her audiences.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Both Hart's "living pictures" and rhythmical gymnastics resemble the children's game of "statues" that requires the moving player suddenly to "freeze" and hold her pose. Rhythmical gymnastics,too, rehearses the choreography of stasis and movement even as it recalls <i>tableau vivant</i> and the staged <i>tableau</i>. The flow of temporality that is motion is arrested and held in the static pose, only to be released again into temporality. In this alternation it, too, serves as a model for Riefenstahl's filmic choreography.

<p>
Of course dance itself suggests the complementary nature of movement and stasis; it defines motion as emerging from and returning to the "stillness of an ideal pose."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Alternatively, we might say that the dionysian aspect of dance&#x02014;its expressive movement&#x02014;is tempered in dance by the poses that derive from apollonian&#x02014;sculptural&#x02014;form. For Nietzsche, famously, Wagnerian musical theater represents the ideal artistic compromise between the dionysian and apollonian principles. Similarly, perhaps, <i>tableau</i> moments within the flux of filmic images&#x02014;the "ceaseless motion" mentioned by Sontag and by Kracauer before her&#x02014;may be their particular form of compromise in Riefenstahl's filmmaking. Understood as a programmed series of images&#x02014;hence both spatial and temporal&#x02014;the body art that is dance has marked similarities to the series of images that is film. At one level, Riefenstahl's fascist, filmic choreography as read by Sontag expresses the struggle between erotic energy and formal control expressed by way of the body in dance.

3. Tableau and Photograph
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
"Photography is a kind of primitive theater, a kind of <i>Tableau Vivant</i>," Roland Barthes writes in <i>Camera Lucida</i>, "a ration of the motionless and made-up face beneath which we see the dead."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Here is another form of visual representation to be placed alongside the <i>tableau</i> moment. The many collections of photographs published by Riefenstahl confirm the view that the photograph relates to an interest in posed bodies and stasis in her work more generally:<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  as we recall, Sontag's "Fascinating Fascism" begins as a review of <i>Land of the Nuba</i>. Decorated with scars and with ceremonial paint, the beautiful bodies of the Sudanese Nuba are perfect subjects not only for Riefenstahl's photographic aesthetic, but for photography per se as read by Barthes. 


<b></b>


"She interprets the Nuba as a mystical people with an extraordinarily developed artistic sense. . . . she insists that their principal activity is ceremonial," writes Sontag ("FF," 38). At the center of their ceremonial and artistic activity is death, thus doubly rendering the Nuba photography's ideal subjects. Of course Barthes is not the first theorist of photography to link photography with death.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  What is distinctive in Barthes's formulation, however, is the link with death through theater, through the <i>cult</i> of the dead. "To make oneself up," Barthes writes, "is to designate oneself as a body simultaneously living and dead: the whitened bust of the totemic theater, the man with the painted face in Chinese theater, the rice-paste makeup of the Indian Katha-Kali, the Japanese No mask."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Barthes, waxing anthropological here, might well have expanded his catalogue to include the Sudanese Nuba who, for purposes of ceremony, paint their bodies with a grayish-white ash, a substance that "unmistakably suggests death" ("FF," 38).

<p>
This is not the place to re-examine the centrality and nauseating glamorization of death in fascist ideology, or its connection with pornography and kitsch so compellingly sketched out by Friedlander.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  We will not linger over the ideology that Riefensthal brings to her photographic work on the Nuba, her interest in their funeral rites as a "ballet of ghosts," or her easy acceptance of the trope of the "noble savage," determined by a specifically German form of primitivism that has been variously linked to fascism.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Our subject continues to be the significance of <i>tableau</i> moments in Riefenstahl's artistic practice, and we take up here its specifically photographic element, suggesting that we must also read the <i>tableau</i> moment in Riefenstahl's work in light of a tendency to play off a specifically photographic arrestation against film's flow of images. Elsaesser has made the connection between "a certain photographic aesthetic" in Riefenstahl's work and the film practices of Arnold Fanck, the director who enabled Riefenstahl's career as filmmaker ("LR," 190). If Fanck, as Elsaesser puts it, was "essentially a still photographer . . . primarily interested in the tonalities of the photographic print," can we not also, Elsaesser asks, read the failures as well as the success of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> as deriving from "a box of photographers tricks"? ("LR," 190) In lieu of such tricks, we will examine the staging of the photographic in <i>The Blue Light</i>, first released in 1932.

<p>
In this film&#x02014;Riefenstahl's first feature film as a director&#x02014;a few instances of the arrested and aestheticized human body are of particular interest. The first of these is a sculptural group, a monument representing young men lured to their deaths by Junta, the Riefenstahl character, and a mystical blue light. In the context of the film's romanticizing narrative and by virtue of its auratic lighting, this sculptural group has the uncanny look not of a monument, but of bodies themselves, mummified, perhaps, or otherwise preserved. In keeping with the film's suggestion that the men are martyrs, this monument has the look of a religious icon.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Further, these sculptural res bear a marked resemblance to the tableau of Mexican mummies with which&#x02014;years later&#x02014;<i>Nosferatu</i> , Werner Herzog's "symphony of death" will open. As in the case of the actual mummies in Herzog's film, the sculptural bodies of <i>The Blue Light</i> appear to be "real" bodies (of actors) taken up into representation. This is not a freeze frame, 


<b></b>


not actually a photograph&#x02014;but the uncanny "real" yet arrested quality of the bodies in this sculpture, their <i>tableau vivant</i> quality, calls to mind Bazin's insight concerning the photograph's ability to embalm time. It suggests as well as Bazin's insistence on its indexical quality, on the manner in which, in registering the body imprint, the photograph records something of its materiality.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  The arrested bodies of the monument suggest an interrogation of the photograph. 

<p>
These frozen bodies are visually continuous with the static poses and immobile expressions of the villagers in this film, repeatedly shot as <i>tableaux</i>, especially of heads arranged frieze-like and in close-up that foreshadow similar conrations in <i>Triumph of the Will</i>. In these arrangements, bodies are doubly aestheticized, at once sculptural and photographic, held up to the scrutiny of a meditative camera.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Such images exist in striking contrast to the nimbleness of Junta's movements: her sinuous motion from cliff to peak is expressive of the natural eroticism that has lead the young men to their deaths&#x02014;for if they are martyrs, it can only be to their libidinal drives. In pitting expressive dynamism against formal containments and stasis, Riefenstahl pits eros against thanatos even in this early film.

<p>
We turn now to our final object of scrutiny, to the actual photograph of Junta which frames <i>The Blue Light</i>. Throughout the film's narrative, the painter Vigo's struggle to arrest the mobile image of Junta on his canvas has also been the film's struggle. In the final shot of the narrative&#x02014;those of the version still available to us, without the frame story&#x02014;Junta is found by Vigo as she lies dead amidst flowers. Death, especially female death, is predictably aestheticized, predictably floral&#x02014;recall the dead Ophelia&#x02014;and Junta's face is surrounded by an auratic halo of light that alludes to Pre-Raphaelite portraits. Found first by eye of the painter Vigo, Junta is only then discovered by the film camera that frames her face: the filmic image is held, becomes a still&#x02014;and is finally revealed to the film's spectator as a framed photograph. Located first in the eye of the painter, in other words, Junta's image is appropriated by the film camera, then passed along to the medium to which, in death, it properly belongs: photography. Underscoring its photographic basis, the film's narrative ends in the image that has motivated it from the start. 

<p>
Of course Junta has occupied the space of representation from the film's beginning: as a creature with a dancer's agility, Junta is linked as firmly to the rhythms of the natural world as is Diotima in <i>The Holy Mountain</i>. Notably, Fanck's 1926 film, which appeared five years before <i>The Blue Light</i>, opens with a shot of Diotima's inanimate face in extreme close-up. "Her eyes are shut," writes Eric Rentschler, "we seem to be looking at a death mask."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Soon this photographic shot of Diotima's face will be animated, enveloped by the film's movement, and incorporated into its narrative.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  These complementary instances&#x02014;the photograph in <i>The Blue Light</i>; the photographic "death mask" of <i>The Holy Mountain&#x02014;</i>both bracket narrative in their respective films, suggesting an approach to film that insists on its photographic origin.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup> 

<p>
Although a <i>tableau</i> moment in film is itself bracketed by the succession of images that precedes and follows it, its essential stasis and "out-of-time" feel suggest an affinity between <i>tableau vivant</i> and the photograph. As in the case of the still photograph 


<b></b>


when it occurs in film, <i>tableau vivant</i> introduces a pause into the film's narrative. Here time is converted into space and the temporal flow of images takes on the aspect of a spatial object. We are reminded of Bellour's contention in "The Film Stilled" that those photographic instants that "suspend the time of movement and open it up" seem to introduce "a kind of paralysis&#x02014;comparable to one that strikes painting into film."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  With Bellour, then, we can agree that <i>tableau vivant</i> also "makes cinema lean in the direction of photography, towards its power to inscribe death."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup> 

<p>
By way of conclusion, let us make a brief detour to an earlier moment in the history of photography&#x02014;to staged photography in the England of the 1850s and 1960s, which rekindled an interest in <i>tableau vivant</i> among the English bourgeoisie. During this period, there is a fashion especially for staged photographs of dead women, such as Henry Peach Robinson's rendering of "The Lady of Shalott."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  For the spectators of staged photographic images, their <i>frisson</i> seems to have consisted precisely in the juxtaposition of the living actress with the dead character she plays, now rendered doubly "dead" via the photographic medium. Of course the dead woman is in any case a Pre-Raphaelite subject: Elizabeth Sidall, for instance, was often painted as dead or dying by her husband Rossetti and his fellow artists.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  There is something necrophilic in this interest, of course&#x02014;it has been claimed that Rossetti was "obsessed with the relation of art to necrophilia."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  But Riefenstahl goes farther. In <i>The Blue Light</i>, Riefenstahl's Junta is herself martyred and rendered icon, becoming in the process masochism's ideal re. In the masochistic regime, as we recall, the erotic object is immobilized and identified with a "statue, a painting, a photograph."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In its extreme form, the object becomes indistinguishable from the representation. Now, perhaps, we are in a position to suggest how the psychosexual dynamic of fascist art&#x02014;its masochistic choreography of movement and stasis&#x02014;is imbricated in the several mediums within which we have situated Riefenstahl's work. For in Riefenstahl's aesthetic, I would suggest, a libidinal charge is actually transferred from the erotic object to the statue, painting, or photograph&#x02014;in other words, to art itself. "Art," therefore&#x02014;which has more than once motivated Riefenstahl's denial, served as her excuse&#x02014;art itself becomes the object of an all-consuming, erotically-charged fixation. Whereas Winckelmann's poetic prose lets slip just how much he is moved by male beauty&#x02014;sculpture becomes warm flesh&#x02014;in the case of Riefenstahl we find precisely the opposite movement: aesthetic pleasure is generated by those forms of art into which the body has been absorbed&#x02014;and rendered corpse.

<i>Laoco&#x000F6;n, or the Boundaries Between Poetry and Painting</i>, G. E. Lessing's seminal mid-18th century aesthetic treatise distinguishing the visual from the verbal arts, uses a Greek sculptural group representing the priest Laokoon and his sons as well as the dramatic narrative in the <i>Aeneid</i> in which it originates as the points of departure for a disquisition on the boundaries between poetry and painting. Like Lessing, Berman privileges writing temporal dimension and its concomitant ability to render narrative and history (both are <i>Geschichte</i> in German), while the visual&#x02014;often tied to bodies in these readings&#x02014;is merely imbued with a non-linguistic expressive force. Also like Lessing, Berman is opposed to the generic boundary crossings that descriptive poetry (Lessing) or ekphrasis (Berman) entail.

It was Riefenstahl's dancing that won her this role. Riefensthal studied at the Jutta Klamt School for expressive dance as well as with Eugenie Eduardova and Mary Wigman. In 1923, at the age of twenty-one, she performed publicly in Berlin, Munich, and other cities until a knee injury terminated her short career in May 1924. See Rainer Rother, <i>Leni Riefenstahl: The Seduction of Genius</i>, transl. Martin H. Bott (London: Continuum, 2002), 13-22, for an account of her career as a dancer. Reviews of Riefensthal performances during her brief career tend to read her dances as derivative, but praise her body for its beautiful form, sometimes read in explicitly sculptural terms. As one writer puts it, her body seemed to be "chiselled from marble, perfectly proportioned, beautifully groomed and evenly honed." <i>Z&#x000FC;richer Post</i> (22 February 1924); quoted from Rother, <i>Leni Riefenstahl</i>, 20.

<i>The Blue Light</i>  and the much-disputed <i>Tiefland</i> (1940/54), likewise juxtapose fluidity of movement with static poses. In this regard, <i>The Blue Light</i> has much in common with <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, since it also features Riefenstahl lithe movements and poses against natural scenes. Similarly, her dance in <i>Tiefland</i>, set in Spain, draws on the erotic rhythm of movement and its abrupt cessation that characterizes flamenco.

Pierre de Coupertin revived the Olympic games at the end of the nineteenth century in a humanistic intellectual climate that believed in the importance of the parallel development of the mind and the body, the importance of physical exercise. Coupertin's undertaking, interestingly, occurred virtually simultaneously with the successful excavation of important archeological sites in Greece that included the Acropolis and Olympia itself.

Since my aim is primarily to contextualize and examine interarts questions in Riefenstahl work, I will not focus on the entire prologue, although its interest is evident. Following the sequences of single male athlete and women dancers in groups, the torch bearer sequence is significant for any ideological analysis. First filmed in slow motion&#x02014;effecting a temporal ellision&#x02014;the torchbearer runs through ruins, then through a scene with intact buildings, a reconstructed world. The torch is shown to travel first through time and then through space, its route traced on a map until finally torch&#x02014;and tradition&#x02014;descending like Hitler through the clouds, arrive at Hitler's Olympic Stadium in Berlin, in Nazi Germany.

As Graham tells us, Stowitts was particularly interested in the male physique, and painted a series of nudes res of UCLA and USC althletes which he called "The American Champions." These homo-erotic portraits shocked the American art commitee and they refused to include them in the American art exhibition in Berlin, causing Stowitts to exhibit them in Berlin at his own expense. Apparently the paintings were well-received by critics, but since the portraits included some of Black and Jewish athletes, Alfred Rosenberg closed the show (<i>LRAO</i>, 136-7).

The camera's intense physiognomic interest in the faces of the villagers in this film no doubt derives from Riefenstahl's collaboration with B&#x000E9;la Bal&#x000E1;zs, who wrote the screenplay for <i>The Blue Light</i>. For Bal&#x000E1;zs, the significance of the photographic apparatus resides in its ability to reveal the expressive power particularly of the human face and of objects. As Bal&#x000E1;zs puts it, "the mute soliloquy of the face speaks": meaning, in other words&#x02014;to recur to Berman's phrase&#x02014;is "written right across their faces." It is the close-up, according to Bal&#x000E1;zs, that allows us to "see to the bottom of the soul by means of . . . tiny movements of facial muscles." While at some remove from Benjamin's optical 


<b></b>


unconscious, Bal&#x000E1;zs's interest in the photographic dimension of film is likewise optical, lodged in the revelatory capacity of the camera. While it contradicted his leftist political leanings, Bal&#x000E1;zs's belief in optically-rendered expressiveness was easily assimilable to a fascist concern with physiognomy and racial typology.

The framed photograph of Junta is not the final image of <i>The Blue Light</i>, of course, that is the image of writing, the ornamental typeface of the book that tells her story. And this was not originally the final image of the film, which we now know only from outtakes compiled and released in 1952, in any case. See Schulte-Sasse, <i>Entertaining the Third Reich</i>, 142.
