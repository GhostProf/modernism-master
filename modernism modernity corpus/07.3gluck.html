The bohemian as a social stereotype first found definition on the pages
of Parisian popular magazines sometime around the mid-1840s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Associated with the carefree and impoverished existence of artists
  on the fringes of middle-class life, the bohemian gained a surprising
  degree of symbolic importance among his contemporaries. Indeed, he came
  to be seen as the first embodiment of the artist of modernity and the
  privileged interpreter of aesthetic truths in contemporary society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Although the social and personal aspects of the bohemian way of life
  have become clich&eacute;s, the cultural meanings and implications of
  the phenomenon remain full of contradiction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These contradictions were already apparent in Henri Murger's
<I>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de boh&egrave;me,</I> a series of amusing
vignettes about artistic life in the Latin Quarter that was published
serially in <I>Le Corsaire-Satan</I> between 1845 and 1849 and was to
serve as a model for all later depictions of the bohemian type. Bohemians,
Murger wrote in the 1851 preface to his book, "are not a race of
today, they have existed in all climes and ages, and can claim an
illustrious descent," from Homer, through Michelangelo, Moli&egrave;re
and Shakespeare, all the way to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  As legitimate heirs to all great artistic traditions of the past,
  bohemians were, Murger implied, ahistorical res, embodying
  transcendental artistic values. Murger, however, did not stop at this
  point but proceeded to make a further, seemingly contradictory, claim.

<B></B>

The bohemian was not only the timeless artist but also a quintessentially
modern social type whose activities were defined by the new commercial
realities of the cultural marketplace. Unlike his romantic predecessors,
whom Murger dismissed as "obstinate dreamers," the true bohemian was
a successful professional and artistic entrepreneur who had learned
to create publicity for his products and to negotiate the cultural
marketplace for his own advantage (<I>Sb,</I> 34). Bohemia was,
Murger insisted, not a permanent way of life but rather a period of
apprenticeship, a transitional phase in the young artist's life that,
like any business venture, could lead to financial success and social
recognition but also to ruin and bankruptcy. In Murger's words, bohemia
was merely a preface before "the Academy, the Hotel de Dieu, or the
Morgue" (<I>Sb,</I> 34).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Historians and theorists of bohemianism have tended to perpetuate
these seemingly incompatible interpretive frames through which Murger
originally explained the meaning of bohemia to his contemporaries. Like
Murger, contemporary commentators have oscillated between visions of
the bohemian as a creator of transcendental art and as a characteristic
product of capitalist modernity. The first position has been argued
by literary historians like Matei Calinescu and Gene Bell-Vilada, who
have identified bohemians with the invention of l'art pour l'art and a
protomodernist aesthetic that would eventually lead to modern abstraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  On the other side, Walter Benjamin has claimed that the true
  significance of the bohemian lay within the tensions of capitalism,
  which radicalized the modern artist but also transformed him into a
  cultural commodity bought and sold in the marketplace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The historian Jerrold Seigel also has seen the bohemian as a product
  of bourgeois modernity, though he placed the emphasis on the social
  rather than the economic aspects of his function. For Seigel, the
  bohemian should be regarded as a liminal re who acted out the inner
  contradictions of bourgeois individualism and helped reconcile modern
  society's opposing needs for social order and self-expression. Pierre
  Bourdieu, too, has stressed the role of the capitalist marketplace in
  the emergence of bohemia, but he also has argued that the bohemian
  found a modus vivendi with capitalism by creating an independent
  intellectual field and becoming a pioneer of aesthetic autonomy or
  l'art pour l'art in the modern world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As valuable and suggestive as these visions of the bohemian are in
themselves, they fail to provide a fully contextualized, historically
specific image of the bohemian. They lack convincing empirical or
theoretical connections between the social spaces that the bohemian
inhabited and the aesthetic function that he fulfilled in modern
society. The bohemian as social type appears detached from, if not in
direct conflict with, the bohemian as aesthetic creator. In other words,
what seems absent in contemporary theories of bohemia is the cultural
middle ground that could connect the social and the aesthetic dimensions
of the bohemian and thus reestablish the historical specificity and
concreteness of the re.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I will argue that the missing cultural image of the bohemian preceded
the social and aesthetic types by almost a generation and needs
to be sought in a radical artistic subculture that emerged in the
late-1820s and early-1830s and defined itself in opposition to bourgeois
modernity. Curiously, historians and theorists of bohemia have tended
to underplay the importance of this early bohemian moment, regarding it
as simply an

<B></B>

immature version of a later phenomenon depicted in Murger's imaginative
work. There are a number of reasons for this critical neglect of the
cultural origins of bohemian identity. Perhaps most obvious is the
uncertainty surrounding its name. It was not until the late-1840s,
thanks in large part to Murger's popular stories, that the word
"bohemian" came to be associated exclusively with artistic life in modern
societies. Before Murger, "bohemia" had a number of nonaesthetic meanings,
long-forgotten by later ages. The word "bohemian" could refer to gypsies,
who were thought to have originated in Bohemia, to socially marginal
urban types with uncertain sources of livelihood, as well as to colorful
members of the criminal underground depicted in melodramas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  However, once the concept of bohemia found its permanent definition
  as an artistic identity in the late-1840s, it was frequently applied
  retrospectively to the 1830s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A more important reason for the relative oblivion surrounding the re
of the cultural bohemian of the 1830s is its subversive implications for
later interpretations of aesthetic modernism. Ultimately, the cultural
bohemian is incompatible with ideas about the modernist artist that gained
increasing importance from the latter half of the nineteenth century
on. Indeed, he problematizes the very notion of social and aesthetic
autonomy, long considered central to the identity of the modernist
artist. As I hope to show in the following pages, the bohemian of the
1830s emerged from a complex reworking of themes and images common in
early-nineteenth-century popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Bohemian identity was symbiotically linked to popular romanticism
  and the melodrama, which were losing ground to more respectable,
  bourgeois artistic forms by the early 1830s. The image of the bohemian
  as a theatrical performer who reenacted and eventually reaestheticized
  the subversive forms of popular culture is obviously incompatible with
  the traditional vision of the bohemian as the producer of high culture
  and canonical art that began with Murger.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What were the historical preconditions that explain the emergence of the
cultural bohemian? What were his characteristic features? What were the
sources of his vision of modernity and how did he implement them within
the historical world? My attempt to answer these questions is based on
a historically informed phenomenology that returns to the early sources
of bohemianism with the intention of contextualizing them and retrieving
their original meanings. This is, in many ways, a traditional historical
undertaking that is deeply concerned with the meaning of texts and their
relationships to contexts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  It is also unconventional, however, in the sense that I define the
  nature of both contexts and texts in fundamentally different terms from
  traditional intellectual history. Instead of assuming the context to be
  an objectively given social or political space within which the texts
  find a stable set of meanings, I see context as a mediated cultural
  realm that is itself in need of interpretation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  The texts of my investigation also take on a different aspect once
  they are defined as cultural, rather than social, phenomena. I see the
  bohemian self as a collective rather than an individual identity that
  acquired its meanings from performative gestures enacted within the
  generic conventions of specific cultural forms. Thus, my exploration
  of the historical trajectory of the cultural bohemian will carry
  me from the world of the romantic drama, the melodrama, and the
  com&eacute;die-Vaudeville all the way to the allegorical romance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no accident that the earliest appearance of the bohemian as
a cultural re was in the context of a theatrical scandal that
transgressed social and cultural norms and shocked all of Paris. The
"Battle of <I>Hernani,</I>" as the event came to be called, is worth
recounting in some detail since it represents the first time the bohemian
appeared as a public re in French cultural life and illustrates the
ways this re was interconnected with the problematic of the romantic
drama. The battle took place on the opening night of Victor Hugo's
<I>Hernani,</I> scheduled to be performed at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;aise on 28 February 1830.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The controversial play was eagerly awaited by Parisian audiences, who
  saw the event as a showdown between romanticism and classicism and as
  an apotheosis of the battle between the moderns and the ancients that
  had been raging for at least two decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Seats were sold out for opening night weeks ahead, and Hugo was
  bombarded by requests for complimentary tickets by such luminaries as
  Benjamin Constant, Adolphe Thiers, and Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e,
  who had been unable to obtain tickets at the box office. Fearing that
  <I>Hernani</I> might become the occasion for political turbulence,
  the progovernment paper <I>La Quotidienne</I> warned, "However great
  importance the performance of 'Hernani' may have for the republic of
  letters, the French monarchy cannot be concerned about it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What, in fact, occurred during the opening night of <I>Hernani</I> was a
different kind of scandal from what the audience had anticipated. The real
outrage of the evening hinged not on the innovations of Hugo's play but
on his youthful followers, who gathered to support the romantic dramatist
against his classicist foes. According to Hugo's account of the event,
his own actions helped transform the performance of <I>Hernani</I> from an
aesthetic controversy of predictable outcome into a cultural scandal of
major proportions. This innovation had to do with the author's decision
to forgo the well-established custom of hiring professional clappers to
ensure the success of his play and to rely on his own unpaid supporters
among the students and artists of the Latin Quarter. When reproached
for the foolhardiness of this venture, Hugo responded that a new art
form needed a new audience that would resemble the play and that this
new audience was to be found among "the young people, poets, painters,
sculptors, musicians, print makers etc." who would come to support the
play of their own free will ("VH," 456).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hugo's calculation that he could rely on the loyal support of the hundreds
of students, artists, and intellectuals who idolized romanticism was
not mistaken. The defense of <I>Hernani</I> was organized by his young
adherents with all the skill and precision of a military campaign. Key
followers like G&eacute;rard de Nerval, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,
and Petrus Borel acted as organizers who generated lists of recruits
among their acquaintances in the Latin Quarter and made sure that they
showed up on opening night. Inside the theater, they scattered in small
groups in the pit and the galleries and acted as coordinated cheering
squadrons for the play. They countered every hiss from the audience with
louder applause, and the commotion in the audience rivaled in interest
the actual drama being performed on stage. As one of the reviewers of
the play commented the following day, "The spectators were on the same
plane as the actors on the stage and they performed as epileptics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  The success of <I>Hernani</I> was ensured by the

<B></B>

fourth act, and between the fourth and fifth acts, Hugo was approached
by the representative of a publishing house, offering to publish the play
for the sum of 6,000 francs. The deal was concluded and signed at a nearby
tobacco vendor's, and Hugo received the 6,000 francs in cash on the spot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the next four months following the scandalous first night (there
was to be a run of forty-five performances), the young romanticists
continued their organized defense of <I>Hernani,</I> which had become
a sacred cause. Writing eight years after the performance, Gautier
remembered <I>Hernani</I> as a mock-heroic battlefield on which

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the champions of romanticism and the athletes of classicism clashed
and fought with all the unparalleled fury and passionate ardor that
only literary antagonism can provoke; each verse was taken and retaken
in assault. One evening, it was the romanticists who lost a speech,
the next, they recaptured it and the classicists, beaten, brought to
another line a formidable artillery of hisses, bird calls, screeches,
and the combat was re-engaged with even more spirit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the perspective of forty years later, Gautier was to provide an
even more revealing evaluation of the significance of the Battle of
<I>Hernani.</I> The opening night<I>,</I> Gautier recalled, was "the
greatest event of the century, since it represented the inauguration of
free, youthful, and new thought on the debris of old routine." It was
the battle "of youth against decrepitude, of long hair against baldness,
of enthusiasm against routine, of the future against the past." The
visual contrast between the youthful defenders of romanticism and its
balding opponents was, for Gautier, a living panorama of the state of
contemporary culture. "It was sufficient to cast one's gaze on this
public," he illustrated, "to be convinced that this was no ordinary
occurrence; what was at stake here were two systems, two parties, two
armies, it is no exaggeration to say, two civilizations, who hated each
other cordially."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier's hyperbolic account accurately conveys the hidden agenda of
the Battle of <I>Hernani.</I> The real significance of the mock-heroic
battle was, it turns out, not the triumph of romanticism over classicism,
which was a foregone conclusion by 1830, but the transformation of the
long-standing aesthetic conflict into a more modern cultural antagonism,
that of artist versus bourgeois, bohemian versus philistine. The
Battle of <I>Hernani</I> witnessed the emergence of radical artists
as a recognizable, collective presence in public life. It represented
the first enactment of the bohemian identity in modern culture. The
theatrical scandal also saw the crystallization of the concept of the
philistine, a term that referred to a newly self-assertive middle class
that assumed the mantle of classicism and came to serve as the defender
of transcendental values, Christian morals, and social stability in
contemporary literary life.

We have become so habituated to the seeming inevitability of the
antagonism between bohemian and bourgeois that we fail to ask why it
emerged at the particular

<B></B>

moment it did and why it took the forms that it did. To say that the
bohemian artist was the natural antagonist of the bourgeois, its radical
"Other," is, in a sense, a tautology that does not explain the historical
particularity of the re. If the bohemian is to be understood as a
cultural phenomenon in his own right, he has to be seen in terms of his
own agendas, his own version of self and modernity that was calculated
not only to shock the modern bourgeois but also to provide a radical
alternative to his vision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This alternative vision cannot be found in any literary text or
ideological tract produced by members of bohemia. It was, rather,
performed through gestures, clothes, lifestyle, and interior decoration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  The bohemian acted out his opposition to philistine modernity, above
  all, by dressing up in outrageous costumes. Extravagant clothing
  and appearance played, in fact, a central symbolic and ideological
  role in the confrontation between the young romanticists and their
  opponents at the Battle of <I>Hernani.</I> Their striking costumes
  distinguished Hugo's followers not only from the classicists but also,
  significantly, from the older generation of romanticists who dressed
  according to formal bourgeois conventions. Victor Hugo's bemused
  description of the appearance of his young supporters on the opening
  night of <I>Hernani</I> provides telling proof of how clothing redrew
  cultural boundaries, not only between romanticists and classicists
  but also, implicitly, between romanticists and bohemians. "From one
  o'clock onward," Hugo recounts,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the numerous pedestrians of the rue Richelieu saw a growing band of wild
and bizarre characters, bearded, long-haired, dressed in every fashion
except the reigning one, in pea jackets, Spanish cloaks, waist coats
&agrave; la Robespierre, in Henri III bonnets, carrying on their heads
and backs articles of clothing from every century and clime, and this
in the midst of Paris and in broad daylight. The bourgeois were stopped
short in their path, stupefied and indignant. M. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier
was a particular insult to their eyes, in a scarlet satin waistcoat and
thick long hair cascading down his back. ["VH," 460]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier, too, makes special mention of the important role that costume
played in the activities of the young romanticists. They were convinced,
he writes, that the evening that was to inaugurate "free, youthful,
and new thought on the debris of old routines" needed to be celebrated
"with an appropriate toilette, some costume, splendid and bizarre, that
would honor the master, the school and the play" (<I>Hr,</I> 79). The
champions of the future took pride, Gautier assures us, in not looking
like notaries and modeled themselves on characters from Renaissance
paintings, romantic dramas, and Gothic novels. Even those who could not
afford the expense of satin, velvet, and military braid necessary to
duplicate their visions of Rubens or Velasquez still managed to look
colorful and romantic in makeshift costumes. Of all the imaginative
outfits of the evening, Gautier's red satin waistcoat, meticulously
tailored for the occasion, seemed most successful in capturing the spirit
of provocation and eccentricity that was the essence of the event. It
became not only the symbol of the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> but of
Gautier's entire career. As he remarked ironically in his reminiscences,

if the name of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier is pronounced in front of a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to understand the serious symbolic and ideological implications
of these seemingly frivolous gestures, it is necessary to extend our
analysis beyond the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> to the broader landscape
of Parisian artistic and intellectual culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  The fashion for beards, long hair, and historical costumes did not
  begin with the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> but went back to around 1827,
  when artists and intellectuals began for the first time to dress up in
  clothes that affronted the conventional dress code of the bourgeoisie.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Young men were to be seen everywhere sporting Venetian outfits from
  the sixteenth century, Polish military uniforms from Brandenburg,
  Hungarian hussars' mantles, oriental robes of all kinds, which were
  worn as markers of artistic identity and personal distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  The young artists in historical costumes carefully distinguished
  themselves from the fashionable dandies or "lions" of the time, who
  dressed according to the latest fashion imported from England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  After 1830, the taste for exotic costumes among young people became
  so pervasive that visitors to Paris invariably commented on it as a
  central feature of the city's cultural landscape. Frances Trollope,
  writing of Paris in 1835, repeatedly returns to the spectacle of
  the "jeune gens de Paris" (young people of Paris) who were visible
  everywhere and whose gestures were seen by everyone as "something great,
  terrible, volcanic, and sublime."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  The theatricality of these costumes prompted another visitor in 1835
  to comment, "One would have thought that certain of the newer plays
  had sent out their characters into the street."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So deep-seated was the association between eccentric historical
costumes and the modern artistic life that it was still echoed in
popular definitions of social types that became prevalent in the
1840s. In obvious reference to the fashion of the previous decade, we
find the following definition of the "Man of Letters" in the multivolume
encyclopedia of urban social types, published in 1842 under the title
of <I>Les Fran&ccedil;ais peints par eux-m&ecirc;mes</I>: "The man of
letters wants to transform himself and to appear like the resuscitated
inhabitant of another century. . . . One can thus encounter the hairstyle
of Saint-Louis in the omnibus, the beard of Henri III on the railway,
and the hat of the Duke de Guise in the restaurant."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same fantastic tastes that prevailed in the clothing of the modern
man of letters could be found in his furnishings.

The literary celebrity has attempted the grotesque rehabilitation of the
furniture of the Middle Ages . . . and soon every man of letters had his
domed chest, his worm-eaten table with clawed feet, his shelves supported
by gargoyles. Ancient platters, ancient frames, ancient chairs, ancient
porcelains, ancient tapestries were the delight of the innovators of
the age, and the fanatical partisans of progress surrounded themselves
with daggers, halberds, clamors and armored plates, transformed into
the inoffensiveness of decorations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why did the young romanticists choose to enact their opposition to
bourgeois modernity through the literal embodiment of medieval, and
more generally, exotic images? What were the cultural and ideological
implications of their carnivalesque performances? The dominant approach
to this question has generally taken a political and ideological turn. It
has been argued convincingly that young artists who idolized the medieval
world were motivated by historical nostalgia, by a regressive desire to
return to an originary golden age that had been lost to modernity but
still haunted it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This view was already put forward by the journalist Delecluze, who, as
early as 1832, raised the question of why young artists grew beards and
sported long hair as gestures of identification with the Middle Ages. He
suggested that the young generation found it necessary to return to the
Middle Ages in order to "retrieve the correct path that was abandoned
by the writers and artists of the so-called Renaissance under Francis
I and of classicism under Louis XIV." Contemporary medievalism, in
Delecluze's view, was thus a philosophic and ideological repudiation of
the Enlightenment and a reactionary search for a spiritual home in the
distant past. As he concluded, "long beards sported by isolated men in
a population without beards are sure proof of a desire on their part to
restore, to regenerate, some old custom or ancient tastes that had been
worn out by time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Plausible as this explanation is on the surface, it becomes problematic on
closer examination. In the first place, the young bohemians were neither
authoritarian, nor religious, nor hierarchical in orientation; they were,
on the contrary, irreverent, antimoralistic, and transgressive. In the
second place, no literal relationship existed between their medievalism
and an empirically or politically defined past. They appropriated their
vision of the middle ages not from history books and archives but from
Gothic novels, fashionable romances, romantic dramas, and melodramas,
whose colorful images saturated the world of popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  In the context of the time, one has to conclude that their stylized
  medievalism represented not so much a conservative repudiation of the
  modern world as a polemical gesture of support for the popular forms
  of modern urban culture. Through these gestures, bohemians signaled
  that they were opposed not so much to modernity in general but to a
  particular bourgeois manifestation of modern culture that was in the
  process of emerging in the 1830s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The testimonials of the bohemians themselves unmistakably reinforce this
interpretation. Ars&egrave;ne Houssay, for instance, a member of Gautier's
early circle, explained that their outlandish costumes signaled their
"common revolt against all prejudice, I might say against all laws."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  Characteristic of their group, wrote Maxime du Camp some years later,
  was "a general repudiation of acceptable habits and common customs,"
  especially those of the "abhorrent bourgeois."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  His scarlet waistcoat, claimed Gautier, represented a "symbolic protest
  against the grayness of modern life" (<I>Hr,</I> 79).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to understand the full implications of these subversive gestures,
we need to regard them as manifestations not of reactionary politics but
of an essentially modern cultural phenomenon that anticipated the radical
youth movements of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
sociologist Dick Hebdige has entitled these movements "spectacular
subcultures" since they create collective and personal identity

  Their defining feature is the ability to invest objects, gestures,
  everyday practices with subversive meanings and thus to invent
  "style." It is through "style" that subcultures disrupt the "authorized
  codes through which the social world is organized and experienced"
  and thus bring into doubt the implicit values and moral norms of the
  majority. In this sense, all subcultures pose "symbolic challenges to
  a symbolic order" (<I>S,</I> 91, 92). Subcultures represent more than
  mere gestures of defiance or rebellion against the established order,
  however. The broader significance of these movements, according to
  Hebdige and others, derives from their links to the often hidden
  or unacknowledged contradictions of mainstream society. Spectacular
  subcultures act out the latent ideological, economic, and cultural
  tensions that exist in the larger culture as a whole. Theirs is, in
  Hebdige's words, "a coded response to changes affecting the entire
  community" (<I>S,</I> 80).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bohemian subculture of the 1830s was also an integral part of a
broader social and ideological conflict that found its most concrete
and visible incarnation in the realm of the theater. Gautier was
ultimately referring to this phenomenon in his reminiscences of the
Battle of <I>Hernani</I> when he claimed that the antagonism between
artist and bourgeois represented not merely aesthetic disagreements but
ideological and cultural incompatibilities that implied nothing less
than the clash of two civilizations. On the one side was romantic drama
and its ancestor, the melodrama, which embodied a distinctly populist
and dynamic conception of modernity still deeply anchored within the
ethos of the French Revolution; on the other side was, not classicism,
but the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, which represented a more respectable,
bourgeois cultural ethic triumphantly claiming ground by the 1830s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The meanings of bohemianism were coded in terms of these theatrical
conflicts, but its historical fate was also intricately tied to their
eventual outcome. At this point, therefore, it is necessary to broaden
our analysis from the actual phenomenon of bohemianism to the cultural
context within which it took shape. The changing world of French popular
drama, and in particular the melodrama, provides the keys to the eventual
fate of the cultural bohemian.

The melodrama has moved to the forefront of literary and critical debates
during the past two decades since the publication of Peter Brooks's
groundbreaking <I>The Melodramatic Imagination.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  This recent body of research has essentially transformed the image of
  the melodrama from a vulgarized and unsophisticated popular genre into
  the essential prototype of all later forms of modern popular culture,
  including the novel. In light of these recent interpretations of
  the melodrama, the bohemians' symbolic identification with the genre
  becomes understandable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There seems to be a consensus in the literature that
early-nineteenth-century melodrama was the cultural heir of revolutionary
politics and the tangible embodiment of modern experience. This is fully
supported by such contemporary texts as the <I>Trait&eacute; du</I>
m&eacute;lodrame, an anonymous tract of 1817 that spelled out most of
the salient meanings

<B></B>

and characteristics of the melodrama for the age. "It is sufficient
to note in the interest of the chronology of art," wrote the author,
"that the first plays that were an emanation of this divine substance
[the melodrama] attained their success during the revolution. Great
political convulsions have this characteristic that they inject into
the spirit a kind of inner anguish which devours it and even when the
storm passes, the anguish remains."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The melodrama was, however, more than a simple reflection of the political
turbulence of the revolution. It was also a therapeutic response to it,
providing, according to our theorist, comfort and intensity of experience
to the suffering individuals who lived through the terrible convulsions
of the age. "Where would we be," he queried, "if the emotional needs
for plenitude that the revolution had awakened within us had not found
a means of satisfaction in the Melodrama?" (<I>Tm,</I> 41) The new art,
he continued, was a luminous presence for contemporary humanity that
"enlightens those with the least discerning eyes; warms the most luke-warm
temperaments; regenerates the most arid imagination . . . [and] satisfies
all tastes, enchants both sexes, and captivates all ages" (<I>Tm,</I> 7).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Behind the excessive rhetoric lies a suggestive historical assessment
of the function of the melodrama in postrevolutionary culture that
only recently has been taken seriously by literary scholars. The
melodrama satisfied the newly awakened taste for public excitement and
passionate spectacle that originally had been nourished by revolutionary
events. But it also provided a language and ideology that could explain
the meaning of these events and make transparent to ordinary citizens
the hidden workings of the modern world. Ultimately, the melodrama was
an object lesson in revolutionary justice, transposing onto the plane of
private life the abstract moral and ideological values of revolutionary
politics. It demonstrated the cosmic struggle between the forces of good
and evil as it played out within the realm of individual consciousness. It
affirmed the inevitable triumph of individual innocence, perseverance, and
steadfastness against the evil machinations of tyrants and villains. In
Peter Brooks's words, the melodrama articulated "simple truths and
relationships" and "the cosmic moral sense of everyday gestures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Equally significant was the unambiguously democratic and universal nature
of the new art form. It spoke in a populist style that appealed to both
the poorest and most uneducated classes as well as the to the middle
orders, providing them with a common vocabulary and common images for
conceptualizing the nature of modern cultural experience. This experience
was given shape through formulaic characters and plot structures that
required little or no knowledge of the sophisticated conventions of
the classic theater. The stock characters of the melodrama, writes the
treatise, consisted of "a buffoon, a tyrant, an innocent and persecuted
woman, a knight, and . . . some domesticated animals" (<I>Tm,</I>
9). The tyrant, who embodied absolute corruption and pure evil, was
"placed in the melodrama to try the patience and virtue of his victims"
(<I>Tm,</I> 14). After much suspense and the extremes of vicissitude,
the outcome of the melodrama was a foregone conclusion: "the tyrant will
be killed at the end of the play, virtue will triumph, and the knight
will marry the innocent and unhappy woman, etc." (<I>Tm,</I> 10).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The melodrama was the characteristic expression of modernity since it
gave voice to the emotions of ordinary people who faced the tribulations
of a destabilized historical world. At its core, it contained a radical
ethic of individual emancipation that was subversive of traditional
social order and political authority. The melodramatic hero and heroine
were invariably of uncertain birth and ambiguous social status, and
they ultimately triumphed over illegitimate power, personified by the
villain or the tyrant. It is true that at the end they often regained
an exalted social position from which they had been unjustly deprived,
but the significance of their actions, nevertheless, resided in their
personal fortitude and inner reserves of strength rather than their
external resources. The central truth of the melodrama revolved around the
sanctity of individual consciousness and interiority--defined in terms of
virtue, patience, perseverance, sensibility, and honesty--which prevailed
over external misfortune and evil. The virtuous knight was ultimately the
incarnation of the new individual born of the French Revolution. He was
the self-conscious citizen and the sentimental hero in one, who "carries
the civil code in his pocket and a sword in his hand, so that he may
learn on the one count what he must defend on the other" (<I>Tm,</I> 72).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For young bohemians concerned with the emancipation of passion,
imagination, and artistic liberty, the appeal of the melodramatic
tradition is not surprising. Gautier devoted a significant part of his
critical oeuvre to the actors, actresses and, impresarios of the melodrama
and admitted at one point to a deep inner identification with the great
pioneers of the tradition. "O Guilbert de Pix&eacute;ricourt! O Victor
Ducange!" he exclaimed, "Misunderstood Shakespeares, Goethes of the
Boulevard du Temple, with what pious care, with what filial respect
. . . we have studied your gigantic conceptions, forgotten by the
previous generation!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  In a tribute to his friend, the melodramatist J. Bouchardy, Gautier
  made a similar point, "What gave strength to Bouchardy was his
  profound seriousness, his unshakable conviction. He believed that he
  had succeeded in discovering the modern formula in art; and those who
  have this conviction are truly happy because they communicate with
  others and dominate their public" (<I>Hr,</I> 161).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier and his fellow bohemians saw in the melodrama the heroic epic of
modernity. It represented the quintessentially modern form of imagination
that had been the first to repudiate the tyranny of classical tragedy
and comedy and had opened the path to a truly modern form of cultural
expression. In this sense, the melodrama embodied the hidden, populist
roots of romanticism and helps explain the deepest reasons for the
bohemians' defense of romanticist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  Their aesthetic affinities were permeated with philosophic and
  ideological implications having to do with the meaning of modernity
  itself. For these aesthetic affinities to crystallize into a distinct
  cultural stance, however, something more was needed than inner
  sympathy. Social and aesthetic pressures that brought into question,
  and eventually made irrelevant and outdated, the cultural values of
  the melodrama had to develop within the larger culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The changes became apparent from the late-1820s in the form of public
calls for a more sober theatrical tradition based on an ethic of prudence
and moral responsibility. "The time is not far off," intoned a reviewer
in the <I>ro</I> in 1831, "for a reaction to set in against the
overflow of the marvelous and the fantastic in favor of common

<B></B>

sense."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  During the 1830s, it became increasingly fashionable to decry the
  violence and vulgarity of the melodrama. As Frances Trollope put it in
  1835, no doubt echoing her French hosts, the melodramas performed at the
  Porte St. Martin contradicted "that universal diffusion of knowledge"
  that was the characteristic trait not only of the French but also of
  the civilized world in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  By the 1840s, the melodrama had acquired the reputation of being
  an exclusively lower form of entertainment that lacked artistic
  merit. In the words of the journalist Jules Janin, the melodrama was
  characteristically loaded "with events, accidents, sudden changes
  of fortune, revolutions, deaths, births, terrors, and convulsions of
  every kind, to please the taste of their habitual spectators."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  Not only was the melodrama aesthetically discredited but it also became
  morally suspect as well, being seen as the chief source of violence
  among working-class youths. Janin established a direct link between the
  melodrama and the criminal population of Parisian jails, who had "at an
  early age frequented those immoral shops, where comedy and melodrama,
  sell, for the lowest possible sum, their lessons of infamy and vice"
  (<I>AP,</I> 211).

The discredited world of the melodrama was symbolically opposed by a new
kind of theatrical spectacle, the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, that had been
growing in popularity since the 1820s. The com&eacute;die-Vaudeville
was unambiguously identified with the newly rich and increasingly
respectable commercial middle classes. It appealed, wrote Jules Janin,
to the "intermediate world" between the masses and the aristocracy and
found its most enthusiastic support on the "neutral ground" of "the
Chauss&eacute; d'Antin and finance" (<I>AP,</I> 203). A caricature
of Henry Monnier's, published in 1831 in the humor magazine <I>La
Caricature,</I> presents the supporters of the new theater in less
circumspect terms, as the very incarnation of philistinism (<A HREF="7.3gluck_1.html"> 1</A>). Under
the title "Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Vaudeville" are depicted four
substantial and unfashionably dressed res chatting in the foyer of
the theater. The two men on the left seem to be engrossed in business
negotiations, a distinctly stout and unattractive woman looks on with
interest, and a hatted male re in a garish striped vest stares out
at the spectacle around him with apparent suspicion and disapproval. A
more unlikely audience for aesthetic appreciation or refined judgment
could not be imagined.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The plots of the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville were constructed to appeal to
such audiences. They were characterized by close fidelity to contemporary
life, by an ethic of prudence and pragmatism, and above all by a kind
of moral Puritanism that was becoming a dominant feature of bourgeois
life. The Vaudeville succeeded in being relevant, entertaining, and
morally uplifting at the same time. Unlike classical tragedy, pointed
out Lady Sydney Morgan, a shrewd observer of the contemporary Parisian
scene, the new theater did not demand the kind of "profound and reflective
attention" that an aristocratic audience "who had passed the morning in
idleness" could provide. The Vaudeville was amusing and practical and,
thus, perfectly suited to the needs of "a merchant who has spent the day
in the counting-house, or to the lawyer who is jaded with attendance in
the courts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The acknowledged master of the new genre was the playwright Eug&egrave;ne
Scribe, variously characterized as the Christopher Columbus of
middle-class culture, the dramatist

<B></B>

of the everyday and the conventional, or simply, the arch-Philistine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  The epithet that all would have agreed on, however, was "the greatest
  amuser of the age" (<I>AP,</I> 206). According to Lady Morgan,
  Scribe's comedies "drew crowded audiences, assembled to laugh equally
  at the classicists and romanticists, whose opinions and disputes were
  exhibited with much humor and truth" (<I>F,</I> 2:68). After attending
  one of Scribe's plays about the unhappy consequences of a young girl
  marrying against the wishes of her father, she commented approvingly:

Not all the tragedies of all the classical dramatic writers of France

occurrence, than the consequences of a marriage in which temporary
inclination is gratified at the expense of reason and propriety. We

such material should have remained unworked and unappreciated. [<I>F,</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The popular enthusiasm surrounding Scribe's plays strongly recalls
the reception of the melodrama earlier in the century. Indeed, the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville could lay claim to being a quintessentially
modern genre for much the same reasons as the melodrama. Like the
melodrama, it was a "realistic" and therefore a "modern" form of

<B></B>

theater since it, too, focused on contemporary events and experiences
and appealed to individual sentiments and emotions. Moreover, the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, too, had broken from the formal rules of
classical comedy, established by Moli&egrave;re and others, and had
invented a truly contemporary form of entertainment in tune with the
needs of the age.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the Vaudeville's vision of modernity, its social and ideological
truths, were of a fundamentally different nature from those of the
melodrama or the romantic drama. The melodrama identified the modern
with dynamic change and an eschatological politics; the Vaudeville,
with stability and middle-class values. The melodrama defined the
innermost truths of individuality in terms of passion, emotional and
physical excess, and the struggle against injustice; the Vaudeville
saw the exemplary modern self in terms of moderation, common sense,
and conformity to social norms. The heroes of the melodrama were placed
in an allegorical universe of historical adversity and were engaged in a
cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil; the characters of the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville functioned in realistically conceived drawing
rooms and country estates and were concerned with the daily conflicts of
social life. Even the marriage ceremony with which both the melodrama and
the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville formulaically concluded had different moral
implications. In both cases, it is true, social harmony was reestablished
through the affirmation of the role of the domestic family. In the case
of the melodrama, however, this social harmony rested on the valorization
of the autonomous, moral self, while in the Vaudeville, it rested on the
collective values of the social hierarchy. As Janin perceptively put it,
a Scribe play did not end with the girl of obscure birth who marries
the great lord, but, on the contrary, "takes in hand the defense of the
opposite opinion, and writes the <I>Mariage de Raison,</I> to prove that
the son of a general would be very foolish to marry the daughter of a
soldier" (<I>AP,</I> 208).

The ultimate significance of the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville lay in its
ability imaginatively to define a collective vision of the modern that
was relevant for the age, to reinvent a pattern of social and personal
ideals that resonated with the experiences of a middle-class, commercial
civilization. This phenomenon, however, went hand in hand with the
inevitable devalorization of the melodrama and the romantic drama, whose
vision of the modern came to be associated with either social degradation
or irrelevance. Honor&eacute; Daumier, the great chronicler of the age,
depicted this development in his caricatures of the 1840s. One drawing,
from 1846, "&Agrave; la Porte Saint-Martin," identifies the melodrama
with an unsavory audience of hulking shapes out of whose midst rises an
emaciated, ape-like re, transfixed in a hypnotic trance, whose gaze
is directed to the stage (<A HREF="7.3gluck_2.html"> 2</A>). A second lithograph from 1833 entitled
"Le Vaudeville et le Drame" depicts a parallel process of devaluation,
associated this time with the romantic drama (<A HREF="7.3gluck_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  The top panel of the drawing, obviously referring to the Vaudeville,
  shows an enraptured audience with vivid gestures, mouths half-open in
  admiration or amusement, and handkerchiefs in hand to wipe away tears
  of empathy. The bottom panel, dedicated to the Drame, paints a sea
  of nodding heads, bored faces, and occasionally horrified expressions
  that convey a collective mood of alienation and indifference.

The Vaudeville's growing popularity among the respectable middle
classes cannot be separated from the fate of bohemianism as a cultural
phenomenon. The triumph of the Vaudeville and the decline of the
melodrama and the romantic drama signaled the erosion of the social
spaces that had defined and given legitimacy to the bohemian's heroic
vision of modernity. The new theatrical tradition could lay claim to
being more up-to-date, more truly expressive of contemporary life, than
the romantic drama and the melodrama. In the eyes of the mainstream, it
had become the legitimate embodiment of the culture of modernity. This
undeniable fact undermined, if not the emotional appeal of the colorful
and heroic world of the melodrama, certainly its viability as a direct
model for bohemian performance and parodic echoing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Dick Hebdige, subcultural styles become reincorporated into
mainstream culture in two different ways: they are either transformed
into fashion or are redefined as deviant or exotic behavior. In the
case of bohemianism, both processes came into play. By the middle of
the 1830s, bohemian medievalism was becoming fashionable among the
well-to-do and the stylish. To be au courant meant wearing clothes that
suggested some medieval or fanciful motif, often taken from current
theatrical productions, and to furnish one's home with heavy, ornate
pieces suggestive of medieval images.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  At the same time, however, bohemians became objects of satire in
  mainstream journals, which both exaggerated their eccentricity and
  deflated their seriousness. Probably the best-known of these humorous
  parodies of bohemianism was a series of articles published in the
  <I>ro</I> in late 1831 under the title of "Jeune-Frances." Bohemians
  were singled out in these articles for their artistic pretentions,
  their bizarre clothes, and their exotic tastes in food and interior
  decoration. The typical Jeune France, wrote the anonymous journalist,
  had a tendency to "weep at romantic verses, go into convulsions before
  primitive colors, faint at the sound of free verse, and fall dead
  before the sight of pure vermilion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Moreover, he deliberately rejected the costumes of ordinary people:
  "On the contrary, he would blush to be like others. But he stands up
  for the common man because the common man is spontaneous, unpolished,
  dramatic, straightforward, colorful, and bearded."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  The dwelling of the Jeune France was also presented as a mixture of
  fantasy and morbid exoticism, with stuffed crocodiles hanging from
  the ceiling, preserved fetuses adorning the mantle piece, and hammocks
  used in place of beds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Even in his culinary tastes, the Jeune France was bizarre, showing a
  preference for "boar's head, wild roe steak, peacocks with large wings,
  cologne, confiture dishes and drinking bowls." In this, as in everything
  else, the Jeune France was driven by the dictates of fantasy over
  taste or good sense, which allowed "metaphor to triumph over appetite."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1833, Gautier wrote a rebuttal to these articles in a series of parodic
short stories entitled <I>Les Jeunes-France.</I> As parodies of parodies,
Gautier's stories were a brilliant counter- offensive that used conscious
exaggeration to deflate the original attack and to deflect its ridicule
from the young artists back on the philistine critic. But Gautier's
humorous saga about the eccentricities of his protagonists had more
far-reaching implications as

<B></B>

well. It provided an unusually acute analysis of the erosion of the
bohemian project within the context of bourgeois modernity. <I>Les
Jeunes-France</I> was ultimately an exploration of the fate of imagination
when placed under the harsh glare of common sense. It represented a
tragi-comic revelation of the incompatibility of the bohemian gesture
with the dominant bourgeois version of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The problem found one of its most ironic expositions in the short story
"Onuphrius," which focused on the tribulations of a typical bohemian as
seen through the eyes of a philistine. Onuphrius, we are told, was "Jeune
France and a passionate romantic" who had shoulder length hair, dressed
in a dark mantle worn in a Dantesque manner, and was fatally addicted
to novels, chivalric tales, mystic poetry, and other fantastic literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  Given such unwholesome nourishment, Onuphrius eventually lost his
  mental stability, developing a tendency to morbid imaginings. By the
  end of the story, the young artist had succumbed to madness and the
  incapacity to distinguish fact from fantasy, reality from dream. The
  moral lesson to be derived from Onuphrius' sad fate was spelled out
  with mock-serious didacticism, "By becoming a spectator of his own
  existence, Onuphrius forgot those of others, and the ties that attached
  him to the world broke one by one."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This cautionary tale about the pseudo-dangers of romantic imagination
obviously mocked the fashionable moralism and pragmatism of the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville that routinely cautioned against anything
that was extreme, unconventional, and impractical. Just as importantly,
however, it exposed the fragility of the romantic gesture itself, which
inexplicably lost its inner pathos and vitality when viewed through the
alien lenses of practical life. The conclusion of Onuphrius was that
the search for fantasy and enchantment, if undertaken in the na&iuml;ve
spirit of the Jeunes France, withered into eccentricity, narcissism,
and even pathology in the context of the world of the Vaudeville.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An even more serious peril, however, lay in the ability of the world of
the Vaudeville to appropriate the forms of the romantic gesture and to
transform them in its own image. Gautier explored this possibility in his
short story, "Celle-ci et celle-l&agrave;" (The latter and the former), a
parodic account of the romantic hero's futile, and eventually ludicrous,
search for passion and heroism in the modern world. The protagonist,
Rodolph, decided to realize his aspiration for emotional intensity through
the acquisition of a mistress, whose characteristics were meticulously
modeled on the pattern of the melodrama or the romance. Rodolph's choice
fell on a fashionable married woman, only referred to as Madame de M.,
whose Spanish beauty recalled <I>Hernani</I>'s heroine and immediately
captivated the young bohemian. Sexual conquest of Madame de M. served only
to dissipate the illusion of romance and ended up provoking in Rodolph
an even more acute sense of boredom and a deeper dissatisfaction with
everyday life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This tale about the impossibility of recuperating the conventions of
the romance in contemporary life was ultimately an allegory about
conflicting visions of modernity embodied in the melodrama and the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville. The protagonist failed in his search for
fulfillment not because of some unique personal flaw within himself or in
his mistress but because of the historic impossibility of the enterprise
in which he was involved. Under modern conditions, Gautier implied,
the heroic gestures of the romance

<B></B>

and the melodrama were inevitably transformed into drawing-room
farce. Thus, Rodolph not only failed to become a romantic
hero but found himself metamorphosed into a character from the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville. "There was," he mused after his all-too-easy
seduction of Madame de M., "absolutely nothing artistic in the scene
that has just been played, and far from making a fifth act of a play,
it is worthy of being represented in a vaudeville; he was angry with
himself for having so badly dealt with such a beautiful subject, and
for having failed to bring passion into such a promising situation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rodolph's story concluded with the decision to turn away from the
dazzling but illusory attractions of Madame de M. toward the real charms
of Mariette, his pretty servant girl who had long loved him. The shift
in Rodolph's erotic investment indicated a major cultural reorientation
as well, involving the repudiation of exotic fantasy in the interest
of everyday experience. The heroic ethic of the melodramatic tradition
finally was admitted to be an unattainable dream, which first turned
into the sham of bourgeois comedy and then into the pretensions of
middle-class high culture. Rodolph's exemplary story, Gautier informed
his readers, needed to be read as a modern morality tale in which the
futile aspirations for romantic transcendence were finally abandoned
for the tangible joys of sober reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier's parodic short stories in <I>Les Jeunes-France</I> marked the
exhaustion of the bohemian project as a performative subculture. The
bohemian attempt to assume the exotic costumes and social roles of
the melodramatic hero and thus to transform everyday life into heroic
adventure had proven ineffectual in the face of social reality. As
Gautier ruefully admitted in an unusually self-revelatory aside, he and
his generation had been mistaken in placing such confidence in symbolic
actions. They had to accept the fact that "an individual equipped with a
beard, a moustache, hair &agrave; la Raphael, several daggers, a man's
heart, and a slightly olive complexion, was not necessarily superior
in attractiveness to a fat grocer, greasy, freshly shaven, and daily
guillotined by his cravat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ultimate implication of Gautier's observation was the acceptance of
the nonidentity between life and art. It meant the final rupture with the
totalizing impulses of romanticism and the melodrama, which had tried to
heal the fragmentation of modernity through aesthetics. If the melodrama
and romanticism had tried to create identity between life and art through
"interiority and sentimentality," bohemianism attempted the same task
through the aestheticization of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  The failure of this project, however, did not mean the end of
  bohemianism as a cultural force. It simply marked the beginning of
  its transformation and reincarnation in forms more appropriate to the
  changed circumstances of the modern world.

  For the rest of his life, Gautier would have a double identity: as

<B></B>

a poet of exquisite, but little-read verses, and as a journalist of
influence, known for his theater reviews, salons, literary essays,
and travel accounts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  Gautier was not the only bohemian of the 1830s to assume an important
  position within the cultural establishment of the July Monarchy and
  the Second Empire. Many other members of the early bohemian circle
  became successful theatrical directors, newspaper editors, literary
  reviewers, or industrial entrepreneurs. Others, however, failed to
  translate their early artistic enthusiasms into successful careers
  and either died early or dropped out of sight.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the social existence of the former bohemians became either marginalized
or integrated within the cultural or financial establishments, the
identity of the modern artist also came to be redefined as an autonomous
aesthetic self removed from the compromising pressures of ordinary
life. Perhaps no one did more to articulate this new ideal than Gautier
himself, whose <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I>  has become a classic
text of nineteenth-century aestheticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  The origin of Gautier's aesthetic parable was almost certainly based
  on an actual historical personage, a certain Madelaine d'Aubigny,
  who dressed as a man, fought duels, and had all kinds of adventures
  before dying in a convent in 1707. The cross-dressing heroine of
  popular legend found incarnation in a successful novel of 1829, Henri
  de Latouche's <I>Fragoletta,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  and it is probable that Gautier's <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> was
  a reworking and a parody of this popular work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  What is certain, however, is that Gautier's version of the story had
  more complex and far-reaching implications than the original. Indeed,
  it succeeded in systematically transforming the bohemian themes of
  the early 1830s into a new aesthetic formula that spoke to the deepest
  cultural and ideological needs of a postromantic generation. For this
  reason <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> became a key cultural document
  of the age that was celebrated by contemporaries as different as
  Baudelaire and Balzac and was cited by the critic Sainte-Beuve as a
  "bible of romanticism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What did Gautier and his generation mean by aesthetic autonomy or l'art
pour l'art?
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  What were the cultural and historical implications of this theory,
  frequently identified with Gautier's remark in the preface to
  <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> that "nothing is really beautiful unless
  it is useless"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
  A close reading of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> makes it apparent that
  Gautier's theory of l'art pour l'art had little to do with classical
  philosophic discourses on aesthetic autonomy, first articulated in
  Germany in the late eighteenth century and subsequently popularized
  in France through Victor Cousin's lectures on aesthetics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
  Gautier's novel was concerned not so much with the philosophical
  problems of aesthetics as with the cultural dilemma of the contemporary
  artist who had lost the ability to differentiate himself from a
  commercialized, philistine modernity. The ultimate achievement of
  Gautier's creative vision was to give voice to a new definition of the
  modern artist, which represented a more up-to-date, more autonomous
  version of the cultural bohemian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is far from fortuitous that this project found expression in
<I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> through the conventions of the allegorical
romance rather than through theatrical performance. The stylistic shift
marked a new mode of perception, a new kind of relationship to the world,
indicative of the former bohemians' disenchantment with direct

<B></B>

cultural activism. Modern allegory frequently has been associated with
a fragmented and alienated universe where the identity of self and the
world had been irreparably severed and where only traces of sacred values
and collective meanings remained.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
  As Walter Benjamin put it, "allegories are, in the realm of thought,
  what ruins are in the realm of time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  The allegorical mode of thought is, thus, concerned with the
  articulation of elevated or esoteric truths that no longer form an
  integral part of mainstream life. This broader cultural definition
  of allegory is implicit in the name itself. According to Ralph
  Flores, "allegory" unites the meaning of <I>allos,</I> other; with
  <I>agorevein,</I> to speak in the market place. It, thus, means,
  "to speak of 'other'--sacred, secret, special--things in a profane,
  political place."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How did <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> function as aesthetic allegory? How
did it transform the increasingly esoteric truths of the bohemian
artist into a modern form of sacred speech promulgated in the secular
marketplace? In order to answer these questions, the novel needs to be
subjected to a more serious and systematic analysis than its fanciful
contents would seem to warrant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
  Literary critics have remarked on the generically heterogeneous
  nature of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin,</I> which mixed the conventions
  of the sentimental novel, the picaresque, and the romantic theater in
  a seemingly indiscriminate manner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
  These diverse styles, however, were organized around a more ancient
  literary genre, that of the religious quest or allegorical journey,
  and this form defined the underlying cultural meanings of the
  narrative. The hero of this quest, the chevalier d'Albert, was the
  bohemian artist, identified by his love for unconventional costumes,
  his addiction to novels and travel stories, and his longing for
  passionate adventure. Like his fictional predecessors in <I>Les
  Jeunes-France</I>, d'Albert, too, began his journey in the frivolous
  setting of Paris drawing-room comedy where he first met and courted
  his mistress, Rosette. He ended, however, in the fantastic world of
  a Gothic chateau, whose balustrades and artificial moats designated
  not so much the concrete theatrical world of the melodrama as the
  disembodied realm of imagination that d'Albert attained only after
  the failure of external sight and the awakening of internal vision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As with most religious quests, d'Albert's story, too, was organized around
a narrative of obstacles and emotional difficulties that the hero needed
to surmount in order to reach his true identity as aesthetic hero. The
catalyst and the symbolic center of these obstacles was the mysterious
re of Mademoiselle de Maupin, who made her appearance only after
the romance between d'Albert and Rosette had settled into a stalemate
and the couple had moved to the idyllic setting of Rosette's Gothic
chateau. Appearing in the guise of a youthful and athletic knight who,
nevertheless, radiated female beauty, Madelaine/Theodore was a true
androgyne, who united "the body and soul of a woman [and] the spirit and
strength of a man" (<I>MM,</I> 330). For d'Albert, she immediately assumed
the aspect of ideal beauty that he had always sought but did not find in
modern life. Yet, she did not function in the narrative as the traditional
symbol of transcendental beauty. As the focus of accelerating sexual
rivalry between d'Albert, who loved her as a woman, and Rosette, who
saw her as a man, Mademoiselle de Maupin was a force of destabilization
who brought into question all existing social conventions, moral norms,
and sexual identities. The principle of beauty that she represented

<B></B>

was based on the unstructured energies of life rather than the idealized
vision of traditional art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For d'Albert, the love of absolute beauty, which was experienced as
sexual attraction to a man, created a shattering moral and psychological
crisis. It was the beginning of a journey beyond good and evil whose
stages were associated with social isolation, moral degradation, and
psychological self-loss. As his crisis deepened, d'Albert's re
became explicitly allied with the villain of melodrama, who had also
been driven by obsessive lust and illicit sexual passion. Unlike the
melodramatic villain, however, d'Albert's experience of evil had a
positive outcome. It resulted in his eventual rebirth as aesthetic
hero who merged the identities of knight and villain into a new kind
of self that was defined not by stable social and moral truths but by
the self-generating energies of creativity. The moment of integration
was symbolized by a night of passion with Mademoiselle de Maupin, who
revealed herself to be a woman only to disappear from d'Albert's life
forever. The physical possession and loss of Mademoiselle de Maupin
brought to an end d'Albert's aesthetic quest. Having gained initiation
into the secrets of absolute beauty, he could become the spokesman of
the esoteric truths of art in a secular and utilitarian world where they
had become alien realities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aesthetic self, which constituted the final goal of d'Albert's
allegorical journey, was clearly a reincarnation of the melodramatic
hero, whose passion and energy had been internalized as imaginative
truth. It signaled the transformation of the melodramatic self into an
aestheticized form of avant-garde identity that, for the first time,
effectively differentiated the true artist of modernity from the
mere bourgeois entertainer. This gesture was ideologically laden even
though it explicitly repudiated direct politics. For in resurrecting
the theatrical genre of the melodrama, the aesthete was doing more
than simply creating distinctions between himself and bourgeois forms
of art. He was also reaffirming the Promethian promise of an earlier
moment of cultural modernity that was increasingly being pushed to the
periphery of modern life. Paradoxically, even while looking backward
to the outdated tradition of the melodrama, the aesthetic self became
the pioneer of a more thoroughly modern form of subjectivity than was
available to the bourgeois self. Liberated from the external pressures of
moral conventions and social conformity, the aesthete was in a position
to valorize the hedonistic pleasures of beauty and passion, as well as
the critical potential of irony and self-reflexivity. He was, above all,
empowered to affirm and protect the autonomy of the creative self in
the face of the encroaching conformism of modern life in ways that the
cultural bohemian had been unable to do.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The autonomy of the aesthete was far from being absolute, however. It
had, in fact, little to do with the popular myths of aesthetic autonomy
perpetuated in the late nineteenth century and already visible in Murger's
preface to <I>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de boh&egrave;me.</I> The modern
artist, as Gautier and the cultural avant-garde of the 1830s conceived of
him, was neither a re of transcendental aesthetic authority possessing
the mantle of canonical high art nor the quintessential professional
inhabiting an autonomous intellectual field. He was, rather, a speaker of
parables and allegories whose task was to translate the esoteric truths
of aesthetic experience within a secular and desacralized

<B></B>

world. His role as allegorist made the modern artist both distinct from
and yet an integral part of the modern marketplace. He had the ability
to proclaim the absolute superiority of art over other commodities but
not the power to prevent its ultimate transformation into the image of
the commodity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier explored the paradoxical implications of this situation through
an ironic parable with which he concluded his preface to <I>Mademoiselle
de Maupin.</I> The parable contextualized his aesthetic project and
marked out the complex role that the modern artist was to assume within
the increasingly commodified cultural marketplace of the nineteenth
century. Assuming for the last time the role of the cultural bohemian,
Gautier launched an impassioned diatribe against the commercial medium of
the mass-circulation newspaper that had interposed itself between "the
artists and the public" and had destroyed the possibility of genuine
aesthetic experience and expression (<I>MM,</I> 51). Rejecting this
inauthentic world, Gautier conjured up an alternate environment for the
public presentation of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin.</I> The publication
of his novel would be proclaimed, he wrote, by "twenty-four mounted
heralds, in the livery of the publisher, with his address on their
backs and breasts" (<I>MM,</I> 53). Bearing banners with the title
of the novel embroidered on them, each herald would be preceded by a
drummer and a kettle-drummer who would cry out the publication date
of the novel and the excellent qualities of its author. This colorful
spectacle, recalling an idealized medieval marketplace, and, indirectly,
the world of the melodrama, was obviously meant to suggest the inherent
superiority of Gautier's novel over other commodities being advertised
on the pages of the mass-circulation newspaper. Indeed, he humorously
predicted, his unique form of publicity would awaken so much interest
in his novel that it would "sell five hundred copies a minute," "new
editions would appear every half-hour," and "a picket of municipal guards
would have to be posted at the door of the shop, controlling the crowd
and preventing any disturbance" (<I>MM,</I> 53). With this projection,
Gautier deflated and deheroicized his own narrative, acknowledging the
ultimate futility of his attempt to elevate his aesthetic truths above the
world of the newspaper. The creations of the modern artist could not be
differentiated absolutely from other commodities. In the final analysis,
their aesthetic beauty was only a form of exoticism whose function was
to increase their desirability in the marketplace not to separate it
from other commodities. His advertising strategies for <I>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</I> turned out to be, he confessed, only slightly superior
to "a three-line announcement in the <I>Debats</I> and the <I>Courier
Fran&ccedil;ais,</I> between the elastic belts, the crinoline collars,
the feeding-bottles with incorruptible teats, Regnault paste and cures
for the toothache" (<I>MM,</I> 53).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Gautier's final message about the imminent fate of his novel in the
modern marketplace was not one of defeat. <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I>'s
formal, if not substantive, superiority over other commodities was
preserved by its ability to draw on the aura of medieval romance and
glamour. Its status as a work of art was guaranteed by its association
with a more colorful, aesthetically superior world, unavailable to
ordinary commodities. In a sense, Gautier's parable pointed to a dual
context for the modern work of art. Its social and economic context was
unalterably determined by the laws

<B></B>

and conditions of the cultural marketplace, but its cultural context
was still anchored within the world of the melodrama, recreated and
reaestheticized by the imagination of the modern artist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of nineteenth-century aesthetic modernity would be determined
by the dialectical interaction between these two different contexts
that represented different aspects of modernity. The social and economic
contexts were to be sources of homogenization and commodification, where
the lines of demarcation between the work of art and the commodity
were inevitably erased, while the cultural context was to be the
source of differentiation and aesthetic distinction, where these lines
were incessantly redrawn and recreated. Significantly, historians of
aesthetic modernism have found it difficult to acknowledge this dynamic
and essentially paradoxical aspect of artistic creation in the modern
world. Striving for clarity and stability in their depictions of the
modern aesthetic project, they have tended to present it as either
an integral part of the commercial market place; or as an autonomous
creative act disengaged from modern life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
  What has consistently remained invisible in their analysis of modernism
  is the unstable cultural middle ground that both linked the avant-garde
  artist to certain forms of radical popular culture and also helped to
  differentiate him from ordinary commercial activities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the act of integrating the re of the modern artist within a
specifically cultural, as well as a social and aesthetic, context opens
up interesting possibilities for modernist studies. Methodologically,
it allows us to see modern aesthetic identities as essentially historical
creations whose contents change over time along with other manifestations
of modern life. Politically, it helps clarify the long-standing
uncertainty about the relationship of the avant-garde artist to modernity
by highlighting his strategic alliances with forms of urban popular
culture that opposed bourgeois modernity from the Left rather than the
Right. Finally, conceptually, it helps us deheroicize and concretize the
re of the modern artist who was a master of disguises and masquerades
that both mirrored and purified aspects of ordinary culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bohemian self had been the first and possibly the most colorful of
these masquerades that would define the modernist artist in the course
of the nineteenth century. It is, perhaps, for this reason that his image
has remained so firmly fixed in the popular imagination as the stereotype
of the modern artist. As popular stereotype, the bohemian was to have a
long and continuous history, from Murger's popular <I>Sc&egrave;nes de
la Vie de boh&egrave;me,</I> which became the hit of the Parisian theater
season in 1849; through Puccini's <I>La Boh&egrave;me,</I> first performed
in Milan in 1896; all the way to <I>Rent,</I> the contemporary version
of the bohemian legend transposed to the New York of the 1980s. Behind
all these images, there continue to hover the charismatic res of
the first bohemians who used costume and lifestyle to define a cultural
alternative to bourgeois modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For practicing artists, however, the bohemian gesture, in both its
direct and aestheticized forms, was a passing historical phenomenon that
was becoming anachronistic by the end of the July Monarchy. "In 1848,"
wrote Albert Cassagne, "bohemia no longer constituted the avant-garde
of artists; it was rather an arri&egrave;re-garde, outmoded

<B></B>

and in disarray, painfully following the lead of others."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
  The invention of the cultural forms of the new avant-garde of the
  1850s was the task of a younger generation of artists who would use
  the image of the popular <I>fl&acirc;neur</I> as the alter ego of the
  modern artist. This, however, is a different story with a distinct
  cast of characters and a new version of a performative public space.

Gautier's two identities were apparently so well insulated from each
other that even Mme de Girardin, the wife of his editor, displayed
astonishment on the occasion of the publication of Gautier's book
of verses, <I>La Com&eacute;die de la mort</I> (The comedy of death):
"What! Th&eacute;ophile Gautier a poet!" she supposedly exclaimed. "This
prince of mockers, this master of irony, this great iconoclast, is also
a dreamer of cascades, a melancholy inhabitant of the floating kingdom of
clouds" (Mme de Giradin, quoted in Joanna Richardson, <I>Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier: His Life and Times</I> [London: M. Reinhardt, 1958], 38).

Between 1851, when the definitive edition of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I>

dedicated <I>Fleurs du Mal</I> to Gautier. Balzac's friendship with
Gautier began immediately after the publication of <I>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</I> as a direct result of Balzac's admiration of the style of
Gautier's novel. For an account of the friendship, see Th&eacute;ophile

The phrase "l'art pour l'art" was first used by Benjamin Constant,
who presumably had learned of the concept through conversations with
Friedrich Schelling and other German philosophers. The idea, however,
was popularized in France through Victor Cousin's influential lecture
series, <I>Du Vrai, du Beau et du Bien,</I> which he first gave in 1818
after his 1817 trip to Germany. As a direct result of Cousin's efforts,
l'art pour l'art became an integral part of academic eclecticism and
the official aesthetic philosophy of the bourgeoisie. See Cassagne,
