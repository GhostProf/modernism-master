<P>
Hysteria was surely the most prominent and memorable <I>maladie de la
m&eacute;moire</I> of the nineteenth century: it served as an
intersection for many points of cultural contestation, becoming a
marker for positions on issues of gender, sex, mind/body,
professionalization and secularization, to name only a few. And
hysteria has remained a privileged site for discussing these issues in
critical and historical writing over at least the last twenty-five
years. Just as the conceptualization of memory and forgetting were at
the core of writings on hysteria in the late nineteenth century, so
recent writings continue to debate the ways we are to remember
hysteria, those who supposedly suffered from it, and those who
supposedly tried to understand or alleviate that suffering. The focus
on maladies of memory forced nineteenth century physicians to consider
what it meant  to have a healthy memory, and a normal relation
to the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 What does it mean to suffer from the past, to
be pained by memory? How is it that some people manage not to suffer
from the past, to orient themselves properly in relation to the loss
of the present? How does attention to the past develop from being a
choice, a matter of taste, to being a duty, a matter of obligation, to
being an obsession, a matter of mental illness? These questions remain
crucial for us in our own fin-de-si&egrave;cle, with memory disorders
continuing to be a a major vehicle for their discussion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>


<P>
The fascination with hysteria and the investigation of it have, of
course, a very long history, about which there is now an enormous and
high quality body of critical writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 I focus on the
moment of this history when the study of hysteria comes together with
the study of hypnosis, both tied to a concern with the question of how
one recalls and manages to live with the past. Hypnosis becomes an
important subject of medical investigation in France after
Eug&egrave;ne Azam brings the famous case of F&eacute;lida X's
<I>d&eacute;doublement</I> (doubling of the personality, or the early
form of what is now called multiple personality) to the attention of
Paul Broca and the Academy of Sciences in 1859.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Hypnosis
was a technique that seemed to show that radical disturbances of
memory could be created in normal people, that our faculty of memory
could be manipulated in ways that deeply compromised its function as
the core of personal identity. Hypnosis and hysteria work together to
create a crisis in thinking about memory and normality. Who is
vulnerable to hypnotic suggestion and why? Who can claim expertise
about such matters, when hypnosis in various forms had been part of
popular culture long before the birth of psychology? The neurologist
Jean-Martin Charcot linked hypnosis to his investigations of
psychopathology, ultimately concluding that hypnosis was a form of
hysteria. And Charcot's authority in regard to hysteria was second to
none. But other investigators inside and outside the medical
profession claimed that we were all more or less susceptible to
hypnotic suggestion. They did not mean to imply that we were all
vulnerable hysterics, but they left it unclear how we discriminated
among these phenomena and among the classes of people with whom they
should be associated. In the 1880s, the alienist Legrand de Saulle
claimed that there were fifty thousand hysterics in Paris, ten
thousand having attacks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Did that not mean that there were
forty thousand invisible hysterics in the city, radically disturbed
people without the major symptoms of the disturbance? How, in this
case, to tell the normal from the abnormal? 

<P>
The effort to define normality and to set firm limits to health was of
great importance in late-nineteenth-century France, a period
in which the Third Republic was establishing itself as a secular
polity of reason, of enlightenment. The new order should have the
capacity to define the abnormal, to explain what had been regarded as
mysterious or had remained within the realm of religion and magic. The
famously deceptive disease of hysteria posed a great challenge to this
regime, and the investigation of equally puzzling hypnotic phenomena
led even the most scientific observers into areas where they were no
longer at home. Doctors knew that hypnosis allowed individuals to have
access to different sets of memories, or to forget (to not
experience?) painful events. In medical amphitheaters they showed
colleagues <b></b> women under a hypnotic trance with no reactions to or
memory of the needles stuck in their arms. But in other showplaces,
there were demonstrations that were more difficult to integrate into
the domain of science. Spiritists and mediums claimed that hypnotic
trances gave them access to different temporal dimensions, that they
could in fact speak with the dead. Conventional memory, they claimed,
could be supplemented through hypnosis with a cosmic memory.
Psychologists, psychiatrists, and neurologists joined hands with the
mediums and tried to ascertain whether they were on the road to a
revolutionary discovery about the nature of time and memory, or
whether they were dupes. Often they arrived in s&eacute;ances with the
latest photographic equipment so as to capture ephemeral events in a
permanent form. Photography, they thought, was the perfect vehicle for
remembering the <I>materialization</I> of the spiritual/mental: in
medicine and spiritism. Was photography also the proper model for an
ideal connection to the past?

<P>
In late-nineteenth century France, hypnosis was a bridge between the
normal and the abnormal. Hysterics lived on the bridge and were
represented as either revealing to us the otherness of serious illness
or the true possibilities that lay hidden 
 within ourselves. Some writers on hypnosis attempted to normalize it
as a transition between states that could be described (if not yet
fully explained) in the language of science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 For them,
hypnosis was very much like sleep, and hypnotic phenomena like dreams.
The spiritists pulled in the opposite direction, pointing to hypnosis
as the link to a realm that could not be accounted for in materialist
terms. Thus, for diverse writers concerned with these sorts of issues,
there was much at stake in the link between hysteria and hypnosis, and
in the question of whether everyone was 
vulnerable to hypnotic suggestion. Does our faculty of memory contain
within it the secrets that allow us to escape from the confines of
conventional corporeal (and 
temporal) existence? Or is our faculty of memory so vulnerable to
suggestion that it reveals the fragility of personal identity? Who has
the capacity to cross into and return from the abnormal; who has the
authority to claim to understand this crossing; and how can they
represent what they have found there to the rest of us?

<P>
In order for hysteria to become conceptualized as a disorder of
memory, the disease had to be separated from its traditional
gynecological aetiology, a task for which Pierre Briquet's
<I>Trait&eacute; clinique et th&eacute;rapeutique de
l'hyst&eacute;rie</I>  was a decisive intellectual
step.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Briquet's treatise assumes importance in large part
because it can be viewed retrospectively as leading toward Charcot's
elevation of hysteria in the 1870s and 1880s to the center of French
cultural life. Charcot established a clinical inventory of the
disease, reducing its florid variety of symptoms to an orderly series
of stages. Although he was convinced that degenerate heredity played a
crucial role in the neurological predisposition to the disease,
Charcot paid increasing attention to the psychological aspects of the
illness throughout his career.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 

<P>
It is crucial to see that in much of the medical writing on hysteria
at the end of the nineteenth century the disease was seen as a radical
dysfunction of memory. The link between memory and hysteria was the
concept of trauma. The term "trauma" <b></b> had been used regularly in
Western medicine to refer to a bodily wound. Charcot developed the
category of traumatic hysteria to understand those instances of the
disease (especially among men) that could be traced to some "shock" to
the nervous system. As Mark Micale has pointed out, Charcot's writing
in this regard was part of a general European and American concern
with the diverse long-term effects of injuries to the head and
spine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In the 1880s and 1890s in Britain and France these
injuries were frequently linked to railway accidents, and the term
"railway spine" designated an array of post-traumatic pathological
effects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But this approach did not result in finding hard
anatomical evidence of a wound. To what, then, was the nervous system
reacting, when it began to malfunction some time after the original
accident (or shock) had taken place? How to understand a wound that
refused to heal yet remained invisible?

<P>
For Charcot the many lawsuits brought against railway lines by
passengers and workers who claimed to have suffered from some
traumatic shock as a result of train travel were often based merely
"on hysteria and only hysteria."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In saying this, Charcot
was partly noting the hereditary antecedents of those who suffered
from railway spine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 But he was also underscoring the
disjunction between the pathogenic event (a train accident, a t, a
brush with danger) and the onset of symptoms, a disjunction both
temporal and causal. Symptoms might not begin immediately after the
original shock, and the symptoms that did arise could often not be
reconnected to the original event through some plausible causal chain.
The troubles of the young male hysteric might be linked in his mind to
the time when he was frightened by a falling object, but it was
impossible for the physician to discover how the trauma produced a
wound which led to a wide range of hysterical symptoms.

<P>
The memory of some occurrence, and not the original experience itself
was seen as the pathogenic factor, and often at the center of the
constellation of hysterical symptoms was an event that disrupted
subsequent memory. The strange case of Mme. D.'s hysterical amnesia
was discussed by Charcot, Janet, and other physicians of the
1880s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Mme. D., thirty-four years old and the wife of an
honest workman, was calmly sitting at her sewing machine in the small
city of M., when she was told by a man she did not recognize: "Prepare
a bed, we are bringing you your husband who is dead." She did not move
but began to cry. The strange man told her to stop crying and to
prepare the bed. Then, he left as suddenly as he had come. After the
neighbors heard her cries, they returned with her husband, who was in
good health and knew nothing of this. Upon seeing him, Mme. D. fell
into convulsions. She cried out for her husband, and seemed to have
hallucinations. 

<P>
After this attack, Mme. D. awoke without any memory of what had
transpired. Indeed, she had lost all memories dating back to the
previous 14 July, about six weeks prior to the false report of her
husband's death. Moreover, and this is what attracted the interest of
writers at the time, she seemed incapable of having any new memories.
The trauma, when combined with a predisposition to hysteria, led to
hysterical "retro-anterograde" amnesia. Charcot used the word
"elaboration" to describe the process through which an idea or
remembered event acquired hysterical potency <b></b> over time. Through
elaboration or auto-suggestion the trauma accumulated force and became
the root of the hysterical symptoms. Like hypnotic suggestion,
elaboration was a process that took place in the brain, but not one
that involved any 
conscious awareness. In the case of Mme. D., the shock of hearing of
her husband's death and then seeing him continued to block her
capacity to remember (and thus to experience) any new
events.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>


<P>
The concept of elaboration depended on a new and complex notion of
the brain and of memory, one presupposing that an original event is
remembered by the subject in ways that are independent of
consciousness. The subject, or perhaps we can say "part of the
subject," registers the event neurologically, storing its
representation in the brain. The stored event continues to have
effects on the workings of the 
nervous system, even if the event itself can not be recalled
consciously by the subject. This process, of course, is very familiar
to us, but in the late nineteenth century the idea of memories having
effects independently of consciousness was new and disturbing.
Curiously, Charcot paid almost no attention to the significance of the
stored event. The initial experience was treated like an electrical
charge that continued to have consequences on the nervous system, not
as an event that was 
cognitively or emotionally unbearable for the conscious subject. The
shock of this experience could even divide the faculty of memory or
"double" it. A doubled 
memory led to split personality, faculties of memory working in
isolation from one another--the same phenomena that Azam saw in
F&eacute;lida X, a case that also fascinated Charcot because it put
memory at the center of hysteria and split personality.

<P>
But Charcot did not pursue an investigation of doubling as a separate
pathological entity. He saw the phenomenon under what he imagined as
controlled conditions in hypnosis. Under hypnotism, subjects are given
access to a set of memories different from those that they would
recall in their normal personalities. This access can often be
remembered, with the proper hypnotic suggestion, so as to integrate
the different faculties of memory. In other words, once a forgotten
event is remembered under hypnosis, it can often be opened to the
normal faculties of recollection. Alternatively, that which happens
during the hypnotic trance can, through suggestion, be closed off from
remembrance in the normal state. "You will remember nothing of what
has happened here after I awaken you."

<P>
These techniques were long familiar to mesmerists and more mainstream
scientific investigators by the time Charcot announced his serious
interest in hypnosis in 1882.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 But when Charcot lent his
prestige to the study of hypnosis and related states, it seemed to
make new phenomena visible and old explanations suddenly worth 
 taking seriously. Charcot took a narrow view of his subject, one that
legitimated his own expertise. There was nothing mysterious about the
phenomena, no invisible fluids or forces from the beyond. Hypnotism
was a series of several "nervous states," which, like the stages of
hysteria, could be isolated and described in detail. As Anne
Harrington notes, "Charcot manages, in one fell swoop, both to give an
aura of medical respectability to a formerly shunned and suspect
subject, and simultaneously to stake a clear claim to the medical
profession's exclusive competency to deal with this
 <b></b> subject."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 For him, hypnotism was an artificially
created hysteria, and thus could be used to investigate cases of the
spontaneously generated disease. One of the ways the master did this
was by hypnotizing female hysterics and suggesting to them that they
mimic the symptoms of male hysterics. His best patients performed
splendidly.

<P>
In the case of Mme. D., hypnosis proved very valuable indeed. First,
it allowed Charcot to determine that the woman was indeed registering
her experiences, even though she could not recall them. "This woman,"
the doctor wrote, "whom we have been able to hypnotize, rediscovers in
her hypnotic sleep the memory of all the facts that have transpired
until the present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Hypnosis thus revealed a "second
self" which did not suffer the effects of the trauma that afflicted
her conscious self. The traumatic idea, the false report of her
husband's death, had acted as a form of 
suggestion, cutting off a faculty of memory as did hypnotic sleep. For
Charcot, the nervous system of the traumatized subject functioned much
like the nervous system of the hypnotized subject. They were
hysterical. The task for Charcot in the case of Mme. D. was to use
hypnotism to overcome the disjunction between the first and second
selves. Hypnosis functioned both as the sign of the pathology and the
possibility of curing it. If the patient was willing to follow the
hypnotic suggestion to remember, then the wound of the trauma could be
healed. 

<P>
But remembering for Charcot did not have any of the connotations of
integrating the self or facing one's desires that it would come to
have in the twentieth century. Remembering was a behavior that Charcot
wanted to promote, a behavior currently inhibited by a (probably
degenerate) nervous system that had not recovered from a shock (a
trauma) it had received. Marcel Gauchet has emphasized Charcot's
indebtedness to the neurophysiologists who by 1870 had established
that "the totality of the nervous system can and should be analyzed in
terms of unities similar in structure and function; that is to say, in
terms of sensori-motor connections and reflex processes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

The reflexive reactions of a degenerate nervous system following a
trauma leave it vulnerable to suggestion--that is one of the key
reasons for the production of symptoms. Suggestion can also be used to
get the system back on track.

<P>
It is instructive here to examine how Pierre Janet made sense of this
same case. Janet had a very different intellectual itinerary than
Charcot, although their interests crossed over the field of hysteria
and hypnotism. Whereas the latter came to this area from roots in
neurology and clinical diagnosis, the former's intellectual formation
began in philosophy, and he wrote his doctoral dissertation on
psychological automatism on the basis of his experiments with
hysterics in Le Havre.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Pursuing a 
second degree in medicine, he was invited by Charcot to direct a
laboratory of psychological research at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
in 1889, where he especially studied the operations of memory in
hysteria and hypnotism. For Janet, abnormal memory was at the core of
hysteria: "I am convinced that amnesia is very important in hysteria,"
he wrote, "and that it is even one of the cardinal symptoms of this
affliction . . . the principal fact which affects more or less all the
others, [is] disturbance of memory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Hysterics often
seemed to live without past or future. Their amnesia, however, stemmed
from their inability to connect to the memories that they did in fact
have. <b></b> The hysterics remembered, but they did not know that they
remembered. The 
investigator could determine this through hypnosis.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
An amnesia of a hysterical nature . . . is not due to the destruction
itself of traces left by sensations. In other words, in all hysterical
amnesias the conservation of memories still continues . . . this
forgetting is only an appearance, an illusion; it suffices to put her
to sleep again, through suggestion, or better still through an
automatic habit, to put her into a moral state analogous to that from
which she has just emerged in order for her to rediscover her
memories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Doctors first became aware that Mme. D. was conserving traces of
events when she referred to them while talking in her sleep, crying
out about the dog that had bitten her in the street.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

While awake, she had no conscious recollection of the dog or her
cauterization treatment for rabies (with Dr. Pasteur!). As noted
above, when hypnotized Mme. D. did show that she recalled all the
events since the practical joke. Janet also showed that Mme. D. could
retain hypnotic suggestions and carry them out after she had been
awakened from her somnambulistic state. There was memory in Mme. D.
But where was it, and why was she unable to access it?

<P>
This last question is not one that seemed to interest Charcot. He
wrote about the patient on the level of the nervous system, not on the
level of consciousness. For Janet, on the other hand, Mme. D.'s
dilemma was further evidence of unconscious or subconscious
memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Psychologists (Janet was probably thinking
especially of Ribot) had written extensively on two facets of memory:
the conservation of memories and the reproduction of images. The third
ingredient that Janet underlined was the <I>"perception personnelle
des souvenirs"</I> (the personal perception of memories) or the
<I>"assimilation des images" </I>(the assimilation of the [stored]
images).

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It is necessary that the personal perception seizes this image and
reattaches it to the other memories, to sensations either clear or
confused, exterior or interior, the totality of which constitutes our
personality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
One can see Janet here as translating Charcot's neurological holism
back into psychological terms. One of the major accomplishments of
neurophysiology in the late 
nineteenth century was to use neurological response mechanisms to
provide an explanation of human behavior without a dependence on the
murky area of 
consciousness. These mechanisms operated independently of
consciousness. Janet was, of course, well aware of these processes,
having cut his intellectual teeth on the philosophical problem of
automatic actions. At least in regard to memory, however, he made
their independence of consciousness an aspect of their abnormality as
memory. Thus, in the case of Mme. D. her amnesia resulted from her
inability to attach the registration of experience to the other
memories which constituted her personality.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
It is as if these patients had become incapable of having a personal
perception of their memories, of assimilating to their present
personalities the images which continue to <b></b> be conserved and
automatically reproduced in their minds; as if their personalities, 
definitively blocked at a certain point, can no longer grow through
the addition, the assimilation of new elements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The lack of a "personal perception of one's memories" not only
restricts one's personality, it is linked with one's openness to
imitate the personalities of others or to follow their hypnotic
suggestions. Janet confronted the difficulty of using this tendency to
imitation, to accept suggestions, as a weapon against the
disintegrated self. Patients could be led to imitate an integrated
personality. But did this make them well or merely continue (even
deepen) the illness?

<P>
Janet's concern with the powers and dangers of hysterical imitation
are particularly evident in his discussion of his treatment of
Marceline.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Marceline entered the hospital in 1887 and was
in a severely anoretic state. Refusing almost all food and water,
unable to urinate, with severe visual and auditory impairments, and
insensible across the surface of her body, she seemed only to have
left a "last breath of life." Janet was alerted to the case by his
brother Jules, and they attempted to hypnotize the patient in the hope
of getting some food into her. 

<P>
Marceline was easily hypnotizable, and the brothers were shocked by
the "singular state" which the hypnotic trance brought on. She ate and
drank without difficulty, was able to urinate on her own, and showed
sensibility and unimpaired hearing and sight. The vivacity of the
hypnotized Marceline was striking, but since the Janets regarded this
state as "artificial," they felt obliged to "awaken" her. As soon as
the hypnotic state was lifted, Marceline fell back into her prior
condition, although she now also had a gap in her memory. She had no
recollection of anything that had transpired while she had been
hypnotized. Pierre Janet noted:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Nevertheless, thanks to these artificial somnambulisms, we were able
to nourish her and cause her to recover her strength. But it was
always impossible to make her eat in the period considered normal,
which we always brought back by awakening her. So that, tired of thus
putting her to sleep at each meal, which was very long, we left her
for whole days in the artificial state. The only result was
apparently a great advantage, since all day she ate well, urinated
completely, and presented more sensibility, memory, and activity. One
day her parents, finding her in this fine artificial state, considered
her cured, and took her out of the hospital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The "artificial state," however, did not last. With her first
menstrual period, Marceline relapsed into her "normal" state, but this
time she had forgotten the weeks since leaving the hospital. All the
symptoms returned, and her parents brought her back to the hospital.
"In the presence of all these disturbances," Janet reports, "I could
do nothing else but put her to sleep again, or rather bring her back
to her artificial state" (<I>MSH,</I> 88). He continues:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Incredibly enough, this situation continued for fifteen years.
Marceline would come to me in order to be put to sleep, enter into
her alert state, and then go away very happy, with complete activity,
sensibility, and memory. She would remain thus for a few weeks;
 <b></b> then, either slowly or suddenly, in consequence of some emotion,
fall back into her numbness, return to the state we had considered
primitive and natural, with the same visceral disturbances. The
forgetfulness now extended over whole years, and disturbed her
existence completely. She would hasten to come to me to get herself
transformed again. Things continued thus for years together, till the
death of the poor girl, who succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis.
[<I>MSH</I>, 88-89]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Marceline's is an important case because it underlines how the study
of hysteria became a study of what is normal. Which is the normal
woman? How do we measure progress? One clear measure of her progress
is that she is eating, that she is not near death. But she must be
hypnotized in order to be "normal," and the cost of this progress is
her increasing dependence on hypnotism and on the doctor. For Janet,
"the provoked somnambulism became for this patient a second existence
more complete than the first and was entirely substituted for
it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Do we read this as the loss of self or as the
acquisition of a reasonable self given to her by the physician?

<P>
Janet came to understand his patient as having lived in a normal state
before puberty. Her problem was not that she had more than one
personality. Jules Janet had stressed that everyone has two
personalities, but most people have their first at least as strong as
the second. Thus, the second personality, the unconscious one, only
erupts in dreams, when drunk, and very occasionally.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

Pierre came to believe that when they found Marceline in her anoretic
state, she had already lost her normal self, and one of the chief
signs of this loss was her amnesia. Hypnosis restored her memory and
thus her first personality. By reconnecting her to the past the
physician returned her to normality. Her second, disordered,
destructive personality could be kept at bay through the forces of
memory.

<P>
But the forces of memory relied on the power of hypnosis wielded by
the physician. The success of the treatment depended on the patient's
vulnerability to suggestion, but this vulnerability itself was a sign
of the illness: "The very power of our suggestions, which seems to us
positive, is a mark of the profound disagregation of the mind, and the
more the recovery appears to be easy, the more the mind is, in
reality, sick."

 Those patients who were apparently healed
through suggestion developed a need for more suggestion, a
"surprisingly violent" need to confess, to be directed. Suggestion can
not set the patient free from the illness, because in hysteria <I>"la
passion somnambulique"</I> (the hypnotic passion) is at the center of
the illness (<I>NIF,</I> 211). The physician will naturally think his
treatment is working well, as he sees the patient, eager to please
him, returning for more treatments and apparently improving steadily
as a result of the suggestions, the "moral guidance" he provides. But
the physician should not be fooled:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
The true sign of the recovery of the patient is the departure of the
physician, who one sends away with pleasure; unhappily, this sign does
not exist among the patients with whom we work. They are always
incapable of dismissing their doctor. This influence exercised by the
physician on the patients appears crucial to us in these mental
disturbances.

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
In cases like Marceline's Janet was inclined to attribute the need for
suggestion to an extremely weak hereditary constitution. The hysteria
is not fixed on a certain idea or a particular memory; it is a global
condition which justifies pessimism about any long-lasting therapeutic
outcome.

<P>
Mme. D.'s amnesia was specific and limited. Although there was some
questionable nervousness in her family's past, she had been basically
healthy until the "lugubrious joke" that the stranger had played on
her. For Janet the case was crucial, because it pointed to what he saw
as the root of traumatic hysteria: dissociation of the personality
provoked by an intense emotion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 How was one to provide
the 
hysteric with renewed capacities for psychological synthesis? One of
the chief 
obstacles was the now elaborated memory of the trauma, which Janet
described as an <I>id&eacute;e fixe.</I> But whereas Charcot's
neuro-hynpnotic approach to Mme. D. was to find an efficacious
suggestion to remember, Janet explored how forgetting might be
essential to cure: "One of the most precious discoveries of
pathological psychology would be that which would give us the certain
means to provoke the forgetting of a specific psychological
phenomenon."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 

<P>
After months of failing to get Mme. D. to make the false report a
conscious memory, he attempted "to suppress it" <I>("la
supprimer")</I> or at least "to modify it" <I>("la modifier")</I> so
as to make it less frightening. While hypnotized, Mme. D. heard a
knock at the door--but instead of the stranger entering the
house, it was the psychologist himself! And instead of announcing the
terrifying news, Janet's image said only: "Mme. D., prepare a bed
because I would like to sleep at your house in M."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Now
when Mme. D. had the recurrent dream about the incident, it aroused
much less emotion, thus allowing her personality to integrate the
various segments of the past into her personal memory. Janet
de-elaborates the memory and thus removes its potency. In Charcot's
terms, by manipulating the image he destroys its ability to 
continue to affect the nervous system. The past is in the way. By
changing the past, the psychologist opens the possibilities of new
memory for Mme. D.

<P>
Janet's interest in real trauma has made him an important re for
recent feminist critiques of Freud, and his emphasis on dissociation
rather than repression has drawn the attention of many who work with
people victimized by violence or traumatic accidents.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The
Freudian concept of repression always involves the question of desire;
how does the person's ambivalence interact with memory to disturb the 
present? Janet was usually uninterested in this sort of question,
concentrating instead on eliminating the potency of the link to the
past. Although he departed from Charcot's neurological model in very
significant ways, Janet also regarded memory as a potentially
pathogenic element, but one that could be diffused through certain
techniques in the present. The potency of the past for both men was
extremely 
dangerous, and Janet emphasized how forgetting was essential to any
healthy existence. "[I]t is more difficult than one generally believes
to forget something. To know how to forget something is often as
important as to know how to learn, because forgetting is the condition
of forward movement, of progress, of life itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 An
element from the past which disturbed the possibilities for
psychological synthesis (a trauma) <b></b> could be removed, or at least
recomposed. "In a word, after the disappearance of the <I>id&eacute;e
fixe,</I> the unity of the spirit is reconstituted."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The
hygienic attributes of forgetting led the psychologist to reach beyond
psychopathology for a general social law: "Forgetting is very often a
virtue of individuals and peoples. 'It is necessary to know how to
forget,' said Taine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>


<P>
Janet struggled to find techniques that would give his traumatized
patients the capacity to forget. Escaping from the grip of the past
did not involve returning to it, or coming to understand its
significance for one's present. The doctor could remove one's memory
of the past, or at least change the past that one remembered.
Nietzsche wrote that the will's "gnashing of teeth" and its "secret
melancholy" was that it could not will backwards, it could not change
the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 With hypnosis, Janet (and many of those around
him) thought he had found a treatment that could.

<P>
Janet used hypnosis as a technology of forgetting in a variety of
circumstances. In their somnambulistic states, hysterics had their
traumatic memories or <I>id&eacute;es fixes</I> removed like malignant
tumors; or, perhaps more accurately, the growths were rendered benign.
Of course, in these conditions, it is not the patient's will which is
"willing backwards." It is the physician's will (in the form of
suggestion) which enters into the psyche of the patient when her or
his own will is suspended through hypnosis. Janet regarded suggestion
as an important psychological phenomenon, but (and here he remained
linked with Charcot's school against the claims of Bernheim and the
school of Nancy) he also regarded it as pathological. The more
vulnerable one was to suggestion, the less stable was one's own
psychological synthesis. Traumatic events were those that disrupted
this synthesis, allowing unhealthy suggestions to develop into
generally pathological behavior. Janet did not classify the types of
events that might become traumatic. Everything depended on the overall
health of one's psychological constitution--analogous to Charcot's
neurological predisposition. If there were degenerate hereditary
factors at work, the hysteric would only imitate psychological
synthesis to satisfy his or her desire for suggestion. In cases where
symptoms were caused by an isolated traumatic event, Janet believed
that a healthy personal psychological synthesis could be restored by
removing the experiences that had 
disrupted it. 

<P>
Another case of Janet's provides an example of restoration through a
transformation of the past. "Achille" thought he was possessed by the
devil, but the psychologist discovered that it was the past that had
taken control of his life. In "A Case of Possession," Janet exorcises
the past with the powerful tools of the new science. After making
Achille's internal devil obey his commands under hypnosis, Janet was
able to discover the precipitating cause, the <I>id&eacute;e fixe</I>
behind his patient's ornate "medieval delusions." Achille had been
sexually unfaithful to his wife, was consumed by fear and guilt, and
was possessed by a subconscious emotion of remorse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 How
to remove the remorse? Remove the sin, and the remorse and the
delusions around it would also vanish. "An idea, a memory, can be
considered as a system of images that one can destroy in separating
its elements, in altering them separately, in substituting in the
compound one or another partial image for those which
exist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In the case of <b></b> Achille, an hallucination of
his wife could be integrated through hypnotic suggestion into his
reconred memory of adultery <I>"au moment convenable"</I> (at the
opportune moment; <I>EMH,</I> 404). Thus, in rearranging the past, the
psychologist grants a full pardon. Achille, we are told, returned home
and remained in good health.

<P>
In this case of what he called <I>l'exorcisme moderne,</I> Janet
participates in the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re school's effort to use
the tools of modern science to redescribe phenomena that had been
thought to belong either to the world of religion or to the realm of
the paranormal. In the <I>Biblioth&egrave;que Diabolique</I> series
and in a variety of other publications, Charcot and his disciples used
the language of psychopathology to demystify religious experience. Not
only did they argue that witches were hysterics and not criminals,
they also rewrote the biographies of saints to show that they, too,
were hysterical. As they did with hypnosis, the doctors were
attempting to show the power of their new techniques over material
once thought to lie beyond the borders of science. By bringing this
material into the scientific domain, the doctors were claiming new
territory for the empire of rational investigation and thereby
increasing their own power within the contest of competing scientific
disciplines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>


<P>
But if hypnosis and suggestion offered a language that could be used
to redescribe religious and paranormal phenomena, it also confronted
some investigators with occurrences that deeply shook their scientific
presuppositions. The experts in hypnosis at the end of the century
were not only to be found at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re and other
hospitals, but were also scattered around the country in carnivals,
s&eacute;ance halls, and even the living rooms of the bourgeoisie.
Despite Charcot's stern warnings about the danger of these
unprofessional practitioners of hypnosis, in fin-de-si&egrave;cle
France they remained enormously popular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 And some of
their most faithful auditors were men of science who sought not so
much to bring the hypnotists or mediums within the territory of
science, but to use their work to destroy its borders.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P>
Perhaps the most important and interesting of these res is Charles
Richet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
Richet's interest in hypnotism and in the
mesmerists preceded Charcot's by several years, but since he did not
medicalize the phenomena his work at first had little impact on the
scientific community. A professor of physiology at the Sorbonne,
Richet emphasized that the self was comprised of memory, and
investigated hypnotism's capacity to erase one's personal memories and
substitute for them another set of images, another self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

In cases of "artificial somnambulism", the new collection of images
were the suggestions given by the hypnotist. Hysterics and those who 
suffered from a <I>d&eacute;doublement de la personnalit&eacute;</I>
(doubling of the personality) were often cases of spontaneous or
natural somnambulism. How did suggestion work for them? Richet, like
Janet, was fascinated by memories which seemed to work outside of
consciousness. These memories functioned as suggestions, creating
alternate 
personalities.

<P>
For Richet, memory was the "prolongation of an excitation" (<I>la
prolongation d'une excitation</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 After some event was
registered, the registration remained a permanent trace of the event.
Conscious memory was just that bit of the past that we <b></b> could
recall at any given time. In fact, memory was much broader, since
nothing was ever lost to it. 

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
As one has said for a long time, no fact disappears from memory:
everything is fixed in it. Everything acts on us and leaves an
indelible trace. Our intellectual existence at a moment is the result
of all the impressions received in our past existence. How few, in
this immense number, are perceived by consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
In order to investigate this broader memory, one had to make use of
subjects who had access to the world beyond consciousness, and for
Richet, like many of his 
colleagues, this meant work on psychopathologies. In addition,
however, Richet was drawn to people on the margins of conventional
society who claimed to have access not only to other states of
consciousness but also to other worlds. The truth was revealed at the
margins, whether these were in hospital wards or spiritist
s&eacute;ances. As Joseph Maxwell, a colleague of Azam's in Bordeaux's
hospitals and an assiduous participant in s&eacute;ances of the
paranormal with Richet, said: "From the beginning of my experiments .
. . I understood that one could study certain apparently supernormal
manifestations only with the aid of mental and nervous
pathology."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>


<P>
Many of Charcot's colleagues (including Janet) were interested in
paranormal phenomena. In the work for his doctoral dissertation Janet
researched the claims of a medium, and Charcot's last publication
dealt with faith healing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 But as we have seen, this sort
of work was usually in the mode of demystification, the mode of 
showing how the extraordinary claims made for paranormal phenomena
were either fraudulent or easily explained through the conventional
categories of science (often of medicine). Richet thought of himself
as a much more open-minded researcher than his counterparts at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re because he was ready to accept the possible
occurrence of some phenomena that the doctors would never consider.
Thus, he was one of the most enthusiastic researchers into that which
could not be explained through our conventional understanding of the
natural world. He wed a conventional belief in scientific progress
(plus real scientific achievement) with an enormous appetite for the
occult and the abnormal.

<P>
For example, Richet stressed the reasonableness of research into the
appearance of ghosts. Now that we can communicate across space
(through the telegraph and the telephone), the next task is to
communicate over time. To communicate over time meant ultimately to
eliminate the border of death. We do not expect to talk to our dearly
departed grandparents, he assured his readers. But we do expect our
great-grandchildren to contact us. That is what scientific progress is
all about.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 There would be nothing about this that
violated the laws of nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 On the contrary, Richet
emphasized, our increased understanding and control of nature would
allow us to overcome the temporal and spatial constraints that
currently governed our lives. This was, after all, what science and
technology had been doing throughout the second half of the nineteenth
century. He was, he kept reminding his readers, a very reasonable
man.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 

<P>
As a biologist interested in memory, it seemed plausible to Richet to
move from the rational investigation of hypnotism and memory into
scientific research on life after death. The physiological basis of
memory was the "prolongation of an excitation," a trace left somewhere
independently of one's awareness. Hypnotism showed that human memory
was far more extensive than human consciousness. Richet began with the
nineteenth-century scientific truism that nothing disappeared from
memory and then wondered whether traces of the past continued to exist
independently of the normal human capacity to recall them. If the
material basis of memory was simply the "prolongation of an
excitation," then perhaps there were media other than the brain in
which this prolongation continued. Perhaps normal recall was only one
way to access past time, and there were other possibilities
unreasonably 
excluded by mere prejudice.

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
This does not mean that what is occult today will be occult tomorrow.
Three hundred years ago, electricity was an occult force. Before
Schelle and Lavoisier, chemistry was an occult science and was called
alchemy; and it is only scarcely twenty years ago that animal
magnetism ceased to be an occult science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
Elsewhere, Richet wrote, "It is the first time that one dares to study
<I>scientifically</I> that which follows death. Who, then, will dare
to say, without having cast an eye on this work, that it is a
folly?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 He wanted only to collect evidence for further
scientific work, and he defended his work on telepathy and on
spiritism with a straightforward appeal to empiricism. We must have
the facts before we can try to make sense of these extraordinary
claims!

<P>
Photography was the privileged medium for presenting these facts in
the late nineteenth century, as it was considered by many as the
technology that perfectly copied the world even while prolonging, in a
real sense, its excitations. Richet used photography not to define and
hence limit what counts as real, but instead to change the way we
understood the nature of reality and our connection to it. The
photographic plate could record aspects of the world that our eyes (at
least the eyes of most people) were not sensitive enough to register.
For those who believed that our unaided senses offered us only the
most superficial connection to reality, photography provided a tool to
investigate the possibility of other realms, other modes of existence
(e.g., the supernatural, the abnormal). It also was used to provide
evidence of the appearance of these other realms in our reality.
Nothing, after all, escapes the camera. In this regard, the camera was
imagined to be like memory, for which nothing was ever lost. The
photograph <I>materialized</I> an event, fixing movement in a
concrete, physical process. The abnormal could be made available for
all to see.

<P>
Thus, many photographers were not only seeking the banal, the
everyday, but they were on the hunt for the abnormal and the extreme.
Reality contained more than most people ever saw, and the camera could
expand the normal range of the 
visible by bringing the abnormal into it. Photographers went into the
hospitals to <b></b> photograph the sick, into the asylums to photograph
the insane, into the jails to 
capture the prisoners (forever), into the s&eacute;ances to record how
hypnosis was used to communicate with the beyond of the unconscious
and the beyond of the <I>apr&egrave;s mort</I> (world after death).
The transmission of something like the <I>fluide vitale</I> (vital
fluid), long appealed to by mesmerists, magnetizers, mediums, and
hypnotists, would be <I>seen</I> through photographic inscription. In
late-nineteenth-century France, these "extreme photographs" were used
to expand the domain of the real, or at least to alter the conception
of reality and its representation that had come to be accepted in the
fin-de-si&egrave;cle.

<P>
Photographs of ghosts were used as evidence of the existence of an
afterlife, or at least of some world beyond the one visible to us in
space and time. These pictures should be seen as part of a more
general effort to find a place for the non-material in a culture
increasingly dominated by technological change and scientific
legitimation. In the age of positivism the search for some evidence of
the existence of an afterlife took on new forms. The acceleration of
secularization in official culture in the last decades of the
nineteenth century reconred the organization of interest in the
"spiritual" or "non-material" world. The increasing pace of
technological change and scientific advance both explained more about
the natural world and opened more mysteries in it. The development of
electric power, the invention of the recording phonograph and the
discovery of X rays are only a few of the markers of what was taken to
be both signs of scientific power and indices of the profound
mysteriousness of nature. For many, photography offered the
possibility of recording this mysteriousness with one of the most
powerful and accessible products of scientific progress. As Gabriel
Delanne put it in 1893:

<P><!--_extract--><blockquote>
We see how much importance critics attach to photographic proof; it
establishes, in fact, irresistibly, the certainty that one has really
witnessed an objective phenomenon, and that there is no question of
hallucination in the sight of the materialized spirit. . . . Well, we
spirits, we have just told the positivists: we have become your
disciples, we have adopted your method, and we accept as true that the
truths demonstrated by analysis, the senses, and
observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<P>
The disciples of positivism would bring one of its favorite tools into
the dark cabinets of spiritism. There the camera would ratify the
reality of phenomena that otherwise would lie beyond the limits of the
scientific imagination. S&eacute;ance-goers were no more the dupes of
fake mediums than were physicians falling for the malingering of false
hysterics. Photography would substantiate the reality of the
phenomenon. One of the key words here is materialization: the process
through which the spiritual or mental world, and especially the world
of the past, is made manifest to us. Photography is the medium that
can give this process a permanent, concrete form. 

<P>
Photography was a powerful example of how an increased understanding
of 
natural processes allowed us to have deeper insight into and control
over the real. Already in the 1870s, attempts to photograph ghosts
were in full swing. Photography <b></b> could stop time (although,
through the 1870s, it still took some time to get a proper exposure),
thus making a permanent trace of reality. Thus photography could be
used to satisfy--or at least address--the desire to remain in contact
with the dead. Photographic portraits of the dead rapidly became a
commonplace in late-
nineteenth-century bourgeois France, with many of the big Parisian
studios advertising portraits <I>d'apr&egrave;s dec&eacute;s</I>
(after death) as part of their repertoire of services for the
consumer. These portraits were usually taken in the hours just after
death, when the pain of loss was most acute and the possibilities of
photographic preservation most apparent. In the 1870s, however, an
enterprising Parisian photographer, Buguet, had the idea of using the
medium to photograph the deceased even after they had been long
buried. He brought mournful clients to his studio at 5 Boulevard
Montparnasse where they would be kept waiting with another "client"
who in 
reality was an associate of the photographer and who acquired
information about the physical characteristics of the deceased. When
the real client entered the studio proper, he or she was asked to
concentrate on the dearly departed. Buguet explained that through a
very special process the photographic plate could capture the
connection that was established between the intense memory of the
client and the deceased. After finishing the supposed exposure, the
photographer withdrew into a second studio where he sketched on the
plate an impression of a head to "satisfy all tastes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

Buguet's studio became well known, and it was even doing a mail order
business ("concentrate on the photographer and the deceased, and our
special camera can record the image . . . distance is no obstacle").
Satisfaction was guaranteed. If the picture does not look at all like
your loved one, send it back and we'll try again. Eventually, the
police took an interest in the studio, and when Buguet produced a
picture of what was supposed to be the commissaire's deceased wife, he
was 
promptly arrested. The commissaire had never married.

<P>
The photographic con artist became notorious after his 1875 trial, and
the photography of spirits fell into general disrepute by the late
1870s. But with the increased scientific importance given to hypnotism
and hysteria in the 1880s and 1890s, photographers were once again
enlisted to make the abnormal real and concrete. Hysteria was said by
many to be the somatization of desires and of traumatic memory; this
process could be revealed by hypnosis. Hysterical symptoms were the
materialization of the past, of the hysteric's wounded memory.
Physicians, psychologists and philosophers worked extensively with
mediums who could reproduce hysterical symptoms when in hypnotic
trance. The hypnotic trance allowed the hysteria to take a material
form. The trance could also allow the spirit to take material form.
Photography could record this <I>materialization</I> of the beyond
just as it had recorded the somatization of the hysterical desire in a
symptom.

<P>
One of the prominent theories of hypnosis in the last two decades of
the century linked the trance to "the doubling of personality." The
person (usually a woman) in the hypnotic trance was said to enter into
(or create) another personality. According to Aleksandr Aksakof, the
photographic plate was able to register the form of this other
personality--as distinct from the body of the person in trance. For
Aksakof, the <b></b> photograph reveals something that is not visible to
the human eye. The light-
sensitive plate can capture things that elude us. Aksakof here goes
beyond using the camera to make permanent astonishing but ephemeral
things we have seen. He thinks of photography as offering us a new
tool for recording the invisible so as to expand what we can
see.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>


<P>
Hyppolite Baraduc was one of photography's most ardent explorers of
the invisible. Unlike the scientists who went to s&eacute;ances armed
with a camera in case a ghost appeared, Baraduc was using the
light-sensitive plate to record what we never could see, attempting to
create an "iconography of the invisible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 In this realm,
"nothing is lost . . . everything is transformed; and if we now
rediscover the earthly dust of worlds or of beings that have existed,
we should also be able to rediscover <I>v&eacute;cues
potentialities</I> [lived potentialities], the shadows of those who
have passed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Photography is not limited to the body, but
can register the vital forces that continue to emanate from our
spirit. Thus, photography is our chief weapon against time; not
because it can freeze the moment in which action takes place but
because it can show us that <I>nothing is lost</I> in our world. Death
is only transformation and photography can give us evidence of the
results of this process.

<P>
The publication of photographs that claimed to show the mysterious
forces at work in our universe quickly resulted in essays that
challenged the interpretations of the images. For the brothers
Lumi&egrave;re, writing in the 1890s, the halo effect that so
captivated Baraduc was only a technical problem of certain cameras or
plates, and it could be alleviated through the choice of particular
lenses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>


<P>
If photographs of the invisible were dismissed as illusions generated
in the darkroom, how was one to explain the photographs that recorded
the very strange phenomena that were occurring in s&eacute;ances at
the end of the century? Verbal reports from even the most
distinguished observers could be dismissed or attributed to
<I>tromperie</I> (fraud), but who could "deny the reality of the
photograph?" With the advent of 
fairly rapid exposure times and of flash photography, cameras joined
scientific observers to document how the hypnotic trance (variously
red as access to an unconscious, a second personality, or a
different dimension of temporality) allowed another world to become
visible in ours. One of the great products of this effort to document
the reality of the spirit world through photography is Julliete
Alexandre-Bisson's <I>Les Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes dits de
mat&eacute;rialisation: &eacute;tude experimentale,</I> published in
1914, based on her experiments in the late nineteenth and the early
twentieth 
centuries with Dr. Schrenk-Notzing and the medium Eva. These
experiments produced "ectoplasm" the substance that emerges from the
medium as a sign of the beyond (this, after all her orifices had been
checked before the s&eacute;ance by Schrenk-Notzing and other
observers to guard against trickery), and ideoplasms. Ideoplasms were
images that appeared above or behind the medium's head--faces of a
spirit called from the beyond. The photographer could capture that
ephemeral image in a permanent form.

The ectoplasm that emerges from the medium's mouth or other bodily
cavities was evidence of contact with the beyond, and the ideal
photograph would show the <b></b> medium in the throes of putting forth
this mysterious substance (. 
<a href="3.2roth_1.html">
1</a> - 
<a href="3.2roth_2.html">

example is when the ghostly image seems to emerge out of the

If it was difficult to doubt the veracity of the photographic
recording (<I>something</I> was in front of the camera and the

Skeptical critics pointed out that the ideoplasms resembled
photographs of famous people that had appeared in popular magazines;
the medium had cut these out, attached them to a stick and a black
sheet, and in the dark room someone had waved them about in front of
the gullible s&eacute;ance participants. The photo of the so-called
"ideoplasm," the critics claimed, was really a photo of a photo! <b></b> 

<P>
Schrenk-Notzing replied that the ideoplasm was a materialization of
the medium's hypnotized memory of a photograph. First there is the
photo of a famous person. The image becomes part of the medium's
extraordinary memory, and these mnemonic powers cause a
materialization of the image, which is then photographed by the
investigator. Thus, the ideoplasm is not a fraud, it is the return of
the image to the concrete through a powerful projection of memory. The
photographer in the s&eacute;ance records this projection, and the
image produced should count as evidence of the 
reality of the powers of the medium's memory. The medium's powers were
real, even if they led only to the imitation of an image. And
photography's powers to document remained substantial, even if they
led only to copies of other photographs in the effort to realize the
fervent desire to see beyond the visible and to live beyond the limits
of mortality.

<P>
We saw above that doctors working with hysterics considered their
symptoms as materializations of the past. In the hospitals, too,
photography became a privileged medium for representing these
materializations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 And these doctors so concerned with the
fragility and the malleability of memory sought to register their own
work <b></b> with permanence. In 1875 Bourneville and Regnard set up a
photographic service in Charcot's wing of the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, and soon after they began publishing
pictures alongside their case studies. This was six years after the
establishment of the Photographic Revue of the Hospitals of Paris, a
publishing venture in which Bourneville became an editor in 1870.
Photography gave direct access to the Truth, and the directors of the
journal hoped to have as much success with their medium as did
clinical photographers of skin disease who had been at work already
for some time. Charcot considered himself not a theorist of hysteria,
but someone who was able to see it more clearly than anyone else.
Seeing things cleanly, grasping them with the eye and without theory
was an attempt to see them outside of time. The perfect instrument for
that (the perfect weapon, as Didi-Huberman has said) was photography.
It was photography that helped the celebrated doctor respond to the
charge that the hysterics in the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re were merely
imitating the disease that Charcot and his famous patients had
prescribed for them. In 1887 the doctor wrote: "It would be something
truly miraculous if I could thus create these diseases according to my
caprice and my fantasy. But the truth is that I am there absolutely
only the photographer; I inscribe what I see."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The doctor
is a light-sensitive plate, he merely receives and records the
symptoms. 

<P>
The difficulty with this analogy, however, is that the doctor himself
is both discursive--the images must be translated into words (what is
lost in the translation?)--and transitory (when he is no longer there
to see, what he has seen disappears). The photographic study is the
perfect complement to the vision of the doctor. The photograph
dispenses with the need for words; nothing can be lost in the
translation. The photograph is permanent, an absolute memory which
will be fresh long after the doctor is gone. But <I>what</I> is seen?

In one photograph (<a href="3.2roth_5.html"> 5</a>), published in 
1878, we see Augustine 
in her normal state. Where in this picture is the hysteria? Where is the
recording or the inscription of a disease? A photograph like
"Tetanisme" (<a href="3.2roth_6.html"> 6</a>) is to reveal the 
core of the illness, or perhaps
the signs of the illness. Or is it that in hysteria the signs are the
core of the disease? By now the series of images known as <I>Attitudes
Passionnelles</I> (hysterical postures) are quite familiar (.
7 - 9).[<a href="3.2roth_7.html">
 7</a>][<a href="3.2roth_8.html">
 8</a>][<a href="3.2roth_9.html">  9</a>]
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 There are many more photographs of Augustine
in the various positions that had come to be famous as the positions
of 
hysteria. The camera, like Doctor Charcot, is presented as inventing
nothing, 
suggesting nothing. The photographic imperative will see all, will
demand revelation from <I>the patient.</I> The photographic imperative
must see into the disease. The model seems to have been the
photographs which were eventually housed in the museum of
dermatological disorders. These images are able to enclose the disease
as they record its signs. The diseased organ, the skin, is there
before us in these pictures; but where is Augustine's disease? Where
is it <I>located?</I>

<P>
The photographic imperative will record what is revealed. But with the
hysteric, the camera's desire to reveal is itself recorded in the look
(even when the eyes are closed) of Augustine. The hysteric is the
subject who will be revealed, and although in this period male
hysteria is recognized (with some pride) as a possibility, it is
the <b></b> <b>[Begin Page 22]</b> woman who is revealed by the 
male doctor and his camera. Knowing
the desire for revelation, acknowledging this desire in her own look,
in the positions of her body, becomes a part of hysterical desire, and
perhaps of hysterical suffering. We see revealed by the photographs
the desire for revelation of the photographer, of the psychiatrist
whose fantasy of passively recording the desire of these women becomes
part of their desire, becomes part of their hysteria. And, of course,
the <I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</I> of these pictures, their artfulness,
discloses the futility and the denials of this dream of passive
recording. In the Archives de l'Assistance Publique one can consult
what seems to be some of the original photographs eventually published
in the <I>Iconographie.</I> On the back of a few of them, written
lightly in pencil, there are instructions to the photographer for
publication-ready copies: "Lighten a little the bottom of the clothes
and the hands; accentuate the eyes in the sentiment of the gaze
<I>[sentiment du regard];</I> put a few creases in the
blouse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>


<P>
This was frustrating work for the physician and his photographer. The
hysteric's illness, according to many, was in her deception, her
<I>appearance</I> of illness. This did not mean she was faking, or
that she was not ill. As the psychiatrist Lasegue noted, not anybody
who pleases can be a hypochondriac; the symptoms of hysteria could be
lies, but they were still symptoms of a real illness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

(Remember the photograph of the ghost/photograph.) How does the
hysteric force her body to lie? How could photography, in recording
that lie, capture the truth? What if the hysteric's production of
symptoms is stimulated, aroused by the photographer's sensitive
recording of appearance? The attempt of the physician to record the
hysteric, to commit her through images to a memory which knew no
forgetting, placed the photographic imperative within the dialectics
of hysterical desire, by which I mean a desire for recognition
combined with a radical denial of the possibilities for satisfying
this desire. The physician/photographer was in the position to reward
the hysteric by 
seeing (and preserving) her as a model of the disease. The hysteric
was in the position of rewarding the physician/photographer by giving
him the model of hysteria. The pictures were immediately criticized
for being modeled, that is, for picturing merely imitations of
symptoms. The models were too good. The women, the critics said, were
only responding to suggestion, not from some trauma in the past, but
from the doctors or other patients. The photographs only recorded the
product of the 
suggestion. But was susceptibility to suggestion a real disease, and,
if so, how was it to be recorded?

<P>
After leaving the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, Dr. Bourneville became the
director of the service of hysteria, epilepsy, and idiocy at
Bic&ecirc;tre, a men's hospital outside of Paris. At his new post, the
doctor continued to make use of photography. He wanted to commit the
physicians' work on disease to memory in forms that escaped the
problems of the interdependence of the hysteric and her photographer.
Bourneville is an exceptionally interesting character. An accomplished
physician, he was a radically anticlerical deputy to the National
Assembly. Not content with chasing the church from hospitals and
positions of pedagogic power, Bourneville edited the
<I>Biblioth&egrave;que </I> <b></b> <I>Diabolique,</I> which published
retrospective diagnoses of saints and miracle workers as hysterics
<I>avant la lettre.</I>

<P>
In 1885 Bourneville established the <I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I>
(pathological museum) at Bic&ecirc;tre. The museum collected human
skeletons, bones of animals, and fetuses in various stages of
development. Mme. Forino, a midwife from the suburb of Gentilly,
considerably enriched the museum's collection with her own 
 private holdings in 1886. The museum also contained portraits of
physicians at the hospital, and photographs of patients in various
stages of their illness, including portraits of the dead and of 
cadavers during autopsies. Bourneville seemed to worry that the public
would think of the museum as a collection of curiosities, and in the
<I>Bulletins</I> of 1887, and also 1888, 1889, and 1890, he repeated
that he had not collected objects for the merely curious, but
materials to be used in serious research. Not only should physicians
be able to use the museum for further study, the 
general public should find there the evidence of medicine's steady
progress against the ravages of disease.

<P>
In 1887 Parisian newspapers reported the visit of the Minister of the
Interior to the pathological museum at Bic&ecirc;tre. The museum was
made up of one room that stored specimens meant to shed light on
various diseases: epilepsy, idiocy, hysteria. A favorite technique for
preserving the signs of disease were wax models of bodies twisted by
illness. But photography remained a privileged form. One paper noted
that the minister stopped for some time before photographs of children
under the care of Bourneville. "It  was easy to follow the phases
of the disease. To the extent that the patient entered the path of
healing, the structure of the face is modified, the brutal impression
of characteristics is attenuated, pupils are dilated, the eyes become
clear and lively and the cheeks are colored and take on a shade of
freshness and health."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Progress for the patient. Progress
for the doctor. Progress for the minister.

<P>
But these are not the photographs I have seen. What remains of the
<I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I> are not signs of progress but signs
of the inexorable degradation that disease brings. We see children
standing next to a measuring stick when admitted to the unit; we see
them next in various stages of their stay in the hospital. In one
series, a young girl, Blaise, is shown looking scared, small but
almost precious next to the measuring rod. Like all the other children
in these pictures, she is clothed in warm, winter greys. Then we see
her some months later and the illness has overwhelmed the person. We
then see her dead, photographed on the cold metal table. But this is
not the end of the story: the insistence on taking the camera to the
core of the disease ends up with a photograph of a brain, which the
inscription beneath tells us was once hers.

In other photographs (. 10-14) we see the death
masks--or should I call them death skulls?--made
before autopsy. 
[<a href="3.2roth_0.html"> 10</a>]

They are among the many found tucked away on the
shelves in the basement of the Museum of Public Assistance of the City
of Paris. Some of the skulls show extraordinary deformations. Others
are striking for their expression, the wisps of hair which still cling
to eyelashes and scalp after a hundred years. The skulls--and remember
the claim that these were not objects of curiosity, but tools for
serious research--were kept in cabinets to be seen by hospital
visitors, doctors, and those who would in the future admire the work
done to understand illness and heal the sick. <b></b> 

<P>
Charcot had told the doctors in his department that they should think
of the extraordinary number and diversity of 
ailments available to them at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re as a vast
<I>mus&eacute;e pathologique vivant</I> (living museum of pathology).
Later, like Bourneville, he aimed at something more permanent, and
more public. A museum that would house the challenges and triumphs of
the new school of psychiatry. Bourneville, in his pathological museum
at Bic&ecirc;tre, wanted to inscribe his work in permanent forms:
photography, wax res, plaster skulls. A living museum, a museum of
the living, would die, its res disappear. With photographs and
sculpture, the terror of illness and the capacities of medicine to
overcome that terror could be rendered permanent. Memory, these
doctors knew, had to be embodied. But bodies, they also knew,
degraded, vanished. The <I>mus&eacute;e pathologique</I> would
overcome forgetting in a permanent tribute to scientific progress and
the powerful physicians who made it possible.

<P>
But as I said, the skulls are in the basement of a museum, and not one
known for attracting long lines of people. There is almost nothing
left of Charcot's museum at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. Soon after
these doctors died, their memorials were unfunded, their 
treasures unclaimed or dispersed. The museum's traces, its remains,
have been almost forgotten. What do these photographs and plaster
res still express of the doctors' hopes for recognition, for
permanent progress; what do they express of the patients' agony in the
final degradation of disease?

<P>
Following Charcot, Freud wrote of hysterical symptoms as residues and
mnemonic symbols of particular experiences. He  compared the
signs of disease to monuments and other symbols of
memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 In late-nineteenth-century French psychiatry,
Freud learned to think of hysteria as the failure to overcome trauma.
A fixed idea is elaborated into a symptom or into a sign, the past
remains in the present. The doctors, too, tried to keep the past in
full view of the present. Of course, they did not embody past traumas,
they tried to memorialize past triumphs. French doctors at the end of
the nineteenth century seized new technologies of representation to
immortalize patients whose pasts continued to wound them. In so doing,
it would be too much to say they behaved like their hysterical
patients. But we can see how the pathological museums came to resemble
the hysterics in their display of temporal disorder; the painful
disruptions of hysteria and the cool display of disease and death in
the museum are inverted metaphors for one another. Both embodied signs
(of achievement, of trauma) which were never to be forgotten. And both
exemplify that desire which can become pathological: the desire to
overcome memory and forgetting, to overcome the passage of time by
representing and collecting the ephemeral in permanent form.

based on a series of lectures given by Janet at the

the psychological understanding of the disease, which he calls a

des traces laiss&eacute;s par les sensations. En d'autres termes, dans
toute amn&eacute;sie hyst&eacute;rique, la conservation des souvenirs
subsiste encore. . . . Eh bien, cet oubli n'est qu'une apparence, une
illusion; il suffit de la rendormir, de la remettre par suggestion, ou
mieux par une habitude automatique dans un &eacute;tat moral analogue
&agrave; celui dont elle vient de sortir pour qu'elle retrouve tous
les souvenirs" (Janet, "L'Anesth&eacute;sie hyst&eacute;rique,"
