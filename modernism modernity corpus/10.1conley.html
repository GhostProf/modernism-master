<p>
Modernism defined itself partly in relation to a dual sense of time as
simultaneously diachronic and synchronic. This dual sense of time was
linked to the modernist idea of primitivism in a way that is perhaps best
expressed by T. S. Eliot as an "historical sense" in his essay from 1919,
"Tradition and the Individual Talent," as "a sense of the timeless as
well as of the temporal and of the timeless and the temporal together,"
as Ronald Bush suggests in "The Presence of the Past: Ethnographic
Thinking/Literary Politics."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Characterizing Eliot's positive reviews of Emile Durkheim's <i>The
 Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</i> from 1916 and 1918 as
 representing "a significant moment of intersection between ethnographic
 and literary modernism," Bush argues that, with regard to "Eliot's
 admonition that the poet cultivate a 'historical sense,' a 'perception,
 not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence'": "It is
 impossible to read Eliot's statement, or the poetry it framed, without
 acknowledging how much the ethnographic discourse of primitivism had
 colored both his idea of the past and his notion of the present."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The "ethnographic discourse of primitivism" to which Bush refers was
endemic to European modernism in a broad sense. The "primitive" was
the name given to tribal art as seen in the West and as a wealth of
inspiration for Western modern artists. In the catalogue from the Museum
of Modern Art show from

<b></b>

1984, <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art</i>, Kirk Varnedoe describes
"primitivism" as "the tendency to admire the virtues of early or
materially less developed societies" which has "a long and diverse
history within Western thought. Even in classical antiquity. Western
literature contains laments for lost simplicity and praise for less
sophisticated societes."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Tribal art was consequently labeled "primitive," even though, as Robert
 Goldwater spelled out in his 1965 preface to <i>Primitivism in Modern
 Art</i>, published in 1938: "It is of course widely accepted today (as
 it was not in 1938) that the art of the so-called primitive peoples is
 not itself 'primitive,' i.e. neither technically crude nor aesthetically
 unsubtle. . . . However much or little primitive art has been a source
 for modern art, the two in fact have almost nothing in common."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 William Rubin elaborated on this explanation in 1984: "That the derived
 term primitivism is ethnocentric is surely there&#8212;and logically so,
 for it refers not to the tribal arts in themselves, but to the Western
 interest in and reaction to them. Primitivism is thus an aspect of
 the history of modern art, not of tribal art."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
The luxurious journal <i>Minotaure</i>, published by Albert Skira
and E. T&eacute;riade in France from 1933 to 1939, was exemplary of
ethnographic modernism in its focus on ethnography, in particular in
the first three issues from 1933. The journal also became a vehicle for
Bretonian surrealism, which had begun to focus increasingly on objects.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 The inaugural issues from 1933 presented tribal practices and art
 brought back from the ethnographic Dakar-Djibouti Misson alongside
 work by such contemporary artists as Pablo Picasso, Andr&eacute;
 Masson, Man Ray, and Brassa&iuml;. In the double number 3-4 from
 December 1933, <i>Minotaure</i> published a series of six photographs
 of "involuntary sculptures" by Brassa&iuml;, born Gyula Halasz in
 Brasso Transylvania (1899-1984), which serve as a sort of "preface"
 to an article on Art Nouveau by Salvador Dal&iacute;, who most likely
 also wrote the captions for Brassa&iuml;'s images (<a name="1"
 href="10.1conley_res.html#1"> 1</a>). In their simultaneous
 evocation of scientific-historical and aesthetic-ahistorical time,
 these photographs exemplify the ethnographic thinking Bush ascribes
 to Eliot in 1919.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
This double issue from December, 1933, expressed a subtle change in
editorial mission that had been implicit from the start, namely the
explicit inclusion of science in the journal's vision of the spirit of
the modern movement.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Following in the footsteps of the alternative surrealist journal edited
 by Georges Bataille, <i>Documents</i>, which ran from 1929 through 1930,
 issue number 3-4 of <i>Minotaure</i> stated that: "It is impossible
 today to isolate the plastic arts from poetry and science. The most
 characteristic modern movements have closely linked these three areas."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 The most obvious reference here is to surrealism, for which Sigmund
 Freud's theory of the unconscious served as much as a point of
 departure as Pierre Reverdy's definition of the poetic image, and which
 became explicitly linked to art with the publication of the first
 installment of Breton's essay "Surrealism and Painting" in the July
 1925 of <i>La R&eacute;volution surr&eacute;aliste</i>. In addition
 to Brassa&iuml;'s so-called "sculptures," this number features five
 articles on psychology, including a psychoanalytic study by Jacques
 Lacan, three articles on automatism, two articles each on photography
 and divination, and one each on painting, sculpture, architecture,
 and music, together with a survey on objective chance. Critics have
 been correct in claiming that "the quest of <i>Minotaure</i> . . . was
 nothing less than a new definition of humanity."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 130]</b>

<p>
Explaining his highly pertinent term "ethnographic surrealism," a variant
on the concept of ethnographic modernism, and one which very accurately
describes the orientation of <i>Minotaure</i> in 1933, James Clifford
states that "[e]thnography cut with surrealism emerges as the theory
and practice of juxtaposition."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 He elaborates the extent to which this combination made sense in the
 1930s in France in particular (as opposed to England or the United
 States):
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I am referring to a more general cultural predisposition that cuts through
modern anthropology and that this science shares with twentieth-century
art and writing. The ethnographic label suggests a characteristic attitude
of participant observation among the artifacts of a defamiliarized
cultural reality. The surrealists were intensely interested in exotic
worlds, among which they included a certain Paris. Their attitude,
while comparable to that of the fieldworker who strives to render the
unfamiliar comprehensible, tended to work in the reverse sense, making
the familiar strange. (
<i>POC</i>, 121)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That "certain Paris" seen by the surrealists as "exotic" was nowhere
better represented than in the nocturnal photographs of Brassa&iuml;,
who settled in Paris in the 1920s and whose work illuminated, as though
from within, his adopted "city of lights's" nightlife.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<i>Minotaure</i> published roughly one hundred and fifty photographs by
Brassa&iuml;, who claimed that "the surrealism of my pictures was only
reality made more eerie by my way of seeing. I never sought to express
anything but reality itself, than which there is nothing more surreal."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 His <i>Minotaure</i> photographs blur the distinction between
 ethnography as science and as aesthetic by examining familiar European
 objects with the same scientific detail as unfamiliar tribal objects
 and by making them visible in their newfound strangeness&#8212;as
 decontextualized as a mask hanging in a Paris art museum.

<p>
Surrealists responded so strongly to tribal art because they
saw themselves as pursuing primitivist goals, according the French
definition of <i>primitif</i>: "Adj. 1. Which is at its origin, or close
to it. 2. Which is the first, the oldest. 3. Which is the source, the
origin (of something with the same nature)."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 As Varnedoe summarizes: "It thus may refer both to foreign peoples
 and to that which is most deeply innate within oneself."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Goldwater finds three "aspects of the surrealists' view of their method
 and art" that "may be called primitivist" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The
 first one coincides with the third definition of <i>primitif</i>,
 "Which is at its origin, or close to it": "In the first place they
 looked upon themselves as continuing a tradition of anti-rational
 exteriorizing of the subconscious that went back to the alchemists"
 (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The second coincides with the second dictionary
 definition, "Which is the first, the oldest": "In the second place
 the surrealists, although recognizing some valuable ancestors, saw
 themselves as beginners, as pioneer explorers in the realm of the
 subconscious" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217). The third may be associated with
 the first definition, "Which is the source, the origin (of something
 with the same nature)": "And lastly . . . the surrealists considered
 that they were working with the essentials of human nature as finally
 revealed by psychology" (<i>PIMA</i>, 217).

<p>
These surrealist properties linked to "primitivism" by
Goldwater&#8212;irrationality, pioneer exploration of the unconscious,
and the study of human nature through psychology&#8212;are

<b></b>

all evident in number 3-4 of <i>Minotaure</i>.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 This number also features an article by Brassa&iuml; on graffiti
 art, "Du Mur du caverne au mur d'usine," illustrated with his own
 photographs, in which he claims that the primitive in the form of "the
 stone age" is "a state of mind" that is as visible on Parisian walls in
 1933 as it was on cave walls thousands of years ago. He sees graffiti
 as emerging from the very source of the human drive to make signs:
 "These succinct signs are nothing less than the origin of writing,
 those animals, those monsters, those demons, those heroes, those
 phallic gods&#8212;nothing less than the elements of mythology."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Mention of the concept of "the primitive" also surfaces in Breton's
 reiteration of the importance of automatism to surrealism in "Le
 Message automatique," where he characterizes automatic writing as a
 "verbal flow" with a desirably "primitive direction" ("LMA," 58). It
 appears a third time in Jean Frois-Wittman's article on modern art and
 the pleasure principle. The entire issue also explores the mysterious
 intersections between chance and destiny that so fascinated the
 surrealists, exemplified by the reproduction of Rimbaud's horoscope,
 and it does so with disregard for the probable tastes of those who
 could afford what Brassa&iuml; himself called a "sumptuous review
 . . . beyond the reach of proletarian pocketbooks."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Outside of <i>Minotaure</i>, whose eclectic pages showed no hesitation in
mixing "high" (sculptures by Picasso) and "low" (cheap postcards) art,
found objects and tribal art could be easily confused by 1933 because
the generic confusion between art and ethnography had become irrevocably
established by then.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 By 1936, the exhibition of surrealist objects in Charles Ratton's art
 gallery was interspersed with tribal ones.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 In the first issue of <i>Documents</i>, Georges-Henri Rivi&egrave;re
 described plans for the renovation of the Trocad&eacute;ro museum
 almost as an "anti-Museum of Fine Arts," a place where objects would
 explicitly <i>not</i> be classified according to their aesthetic appeal.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 But three years later, under the influence of Ratton, the
 Trocad&eacute;ro became the venue for the "Exposition de Bronzes
 d'Ivoires du Royaume du B&eacute;nin," organized by Ratton himself, who
 set up the exhibit to show off the beauty of the pieces displayed. As
 Jean-Louis Paudrat explains, "despite the 'counter-aesthetic'
 orientation a few years earlier of those who had reorganized the
 Trocad&eacute;ro Museum, 'certain rare and beautiful pieces' were
 transformed from indexes of another way of life into masterpieces of
 world art."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
From the start, this divided attention paid to tribal objects&#8212;viewed
as keys to a deeper scientific understanding of foreign cultures whose
goal in creating them had not been aesthetic, but also as models of
artistic skill, achievement, and beauty&#8212;diversified the ways in
which they were perceived. Certain critics and collectors, like Goldwater,
Max Ernst, and Tristan Tzara, retained an awareness of the historical
context in which these objects were made.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Others, like Breton, and, according to William Rubin, Picasso,
 cared far more for their symbolic, conceptual and formal values,
 appreciable with no historical knowledge. That view, it is true,
 entailed misunderstandings of their original function, called "creative
 misreadings" by Rubin, which, in the case of Picasso, resulted in turn
 in some of the masterpieces of Western art.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 This double perception of tribal objects as existing within historical
 time and outside of it, as temporal and timeless, added to their
 mystery&#8212;a mystery which spilled over onto

<b></b>

the surrealist objects that co-existed with tribal art in the studios of
most of the surrealists. Through a similar process of decontextualization,
surrealist objects likewise became timeless aesthetic objects nevertheless
haunted by an unknown historical past.

<p>
The most important quality shared by tribal art and surrealist objects
was a perceived sacred presence within the object capable of marshalling
"latent forces" and communicating with the viewer. Brassa&iuml;'s
"sculptures" were initially labeled "large-scale" or "automatic objects,"
which he photographed "in collaboration" with Dal&iacute;. He argued
in a newspaper article from 1950 that photography was the art of giving
"things the chance to express themselves."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Certainly the surrealists sought what Walter Benjamin called "<i>profane
 illumination</i>, a materialistic, anthropological inspiration" in
 their everyday world and in the material objects populating that world.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 For despite their iconoclastic attitude towards such sacred icons
 of bourgeois taste as the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, the surrealists sought,
 in those "lowly" objects they discovered in flea markets alongside
 the inexpensive African masks they collected, a similar kind of aura
 to that of the "high" art hanging in the Louvre.

<p>
Already in 1931, in his essay "Objets surr&eacute;alistes" in <i>Le
Surr&eacute;alisme au service de la r&eacute;volution</i>, Dal&iacute;
had claimed that the surrealist object was invested with erotic
power. Andr&eacute; Breton attributes the same power to the found
object in "La Beaut&eacute; sera convulsive," in the May 1934 issue
of <i>Minotaure</i> (the issue following the one with Brassa&iuml;'s
"involuntary sculptures"). Breton compares being in Paris to being in a
<i>for&ecirc;t d'indices</i> to which the surrealist responds eagerly,
eyes wide open.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Within this "forest" of signs Breton includes the sort of found object
 he had already described in <i>Nadja</i> years earlier, and which
 alone reveals :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the marvelous precipitate of desire. It alone can enlarge the universe,
causing it to relinquish some of its opacity, letting us discover
its extraordinary capacities for reserve. . . . Daily life abounds,
moreover, in just this sort of small discovery, where there is frequently
an element of apparent gratuitousness. . . . I am profoundly persuaded
that any perception registered in the most involuntary way . . . bears
in itself the solution, symbolic or other, of a problem you have with
yourself. . . . You have only to know how to get along in the labyrinth.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like the mythological Minotaur trapped in the labyrinth, human
beings must try to decipher the world that surrounds them as a way of
understanding themselves and their own natures divided between conscious
and unconscious minds, just as the Minotaur's nature was divided between
human and animal. Unlike the Minotaur, the surrealist hopes to survive
the experience of the labyrinth and to emerge from it whole.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
Surrealist objects aid this process of exploration and survival by helping
to clarify our own desires and drives: they reflect back aspects of the
self to the person who finds them, as Breton suggests. They operate in two
ways: making the familiar strange, as Clifford claims, and also making
the strangeness in ourselves comprehensible. In this way they manifest
characteristics of the Freudian uncanny, the deeply disquieting nature
of finding the strange in the familiar, of discovering that a woman is
only a doll, for example, that an animate being is in fact inanimate
(or the opposite). Freud's essay,

<b></b>

translated into French only in 1933, the same year that <i>Minotaure</i>
was launched, bolstered the surrealists in their on-going investigations
of the psychic properties of objects.

<p>
In their quasi-animate status, surrealist objects resemble the tribal
masks brought back by ethnographers from Africa and Oceania and placed
in museums. These were initially studied not aesthetically&#8212;as what
became known in Europe as "primitive" works&#8212;but scientifically,
as elements of religious worship whose value lay in the transformation
they underwent during rituals when, momentarily, they seemed to become
inhabited by the potent spirit forces called upon by the tribal group. At
the height of the religious ceremony, therefore, these objects became
double, embodying and representing a force other than themselves in
a manner parallel to the way the surrealist experienced the dawning
awareness, through automatism (often practiced in a group), of the
functioning of the unconscious mind, as though it were a separate and
mysterious part of the self.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Ethnography, the social science that studied tribal art in
context, thus shared in common with surrealism a turning away
from Cartesianism. Mich&egrave;le Richman argues that "although
methodologicially closer to the social sciences," ethnography "drew
insights from other cultures into modes of thought resistant to the
definition of logic sanctioned by the West."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<i>Minotaure</i> presented the point of view of what Clifford calls the
"participant observer." The artists in these pages look at their own
cultures as closely as they examine those of others and thus define
themselves as receptors as much as creators of art and culture. They
provide the "scientific description of individual cultures" from the
dictionary definition of <i>ethnograpy</i>; it is left to the reader
to process these juxtaposed descriptions and images according to the
interest in <i>ethnology</i> pronounced by the journal's masthead, which
purports to "analyze cultures," both foreign and familiar, rather than
merely to describe them. Thanks to the journal's equalizing strategy of
juxtaposition, within its pages, Brassa&iuml;'s "involuntary sculptures"
received equal billing with art by mediums and the mentally ill, as
well as African masks and with sculptures by such artists as Picasso
and Giacometti photographed in their studios.

<p>
Ideologically, ethnography also strove to contextualize and equalize. As
Michel Leiris passionately affirmed in an article in <i>Documents</i>
from 1930 announcing the Dakar-Djibouti mission, in which he participated
and upon which he later reported in <i>Minotaure</i>, ethnography is the
"most generally human science, because not limited&#8212;like most of the
others&#8212;to white men . . . it extends to the totality of humankind."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Similarly, in his article on graffiti art, in number 3-4 of
 <i>Minotaure</i>, Brassa&iuml; claimed that what could be called
 ethnographic thinking had made all people equal, throughout historical
 time ("DMDC," 6). Breton applies the same principle to the equalizing
 force of surrealist automatism in the same number: "The main
 quality of surrealism is to have proclaimed the total equality of
 all normal human beings in front of the subliminal message" ("LMA,"
 62). <i>Minotaure</i> certainly equalized photography with sculpture
 and painting, by elevating it far above the role of mere illustration
 and inviting photographers like Brassa&iuml; and Man Ray to contribute
 articles about it to the journal.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Within the larger context of <i>Minotaure</i>, what is the reader to
make of Brassa&iuml;'s so-called "involuntary sculptures"&#8212;which
are sculptures, not objects, as Dawn Ades reminds us, because made by
human hands, their "authors" identified by a triple "X" in the issue's
table of contents?
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The first two are more or less recognizable for what they are, rolled
 bus tickets. The first one invites a flash of recognition for all those
 private moments when we have nervously toyed with a piece of paper
 in our pockets. The second could at first glance be confused with
 an animate creature like an insect. Its mystery derives partly from
 the fact that it is blown up and consequently distorted to our eyes in
 relation to its "natural" appearance, precisely as though the photograph
 were intended for scientific observation. The framing underscores the
 fact that the viewer doubles the photographer's position, which is
 that of an ethnographic "observer."

<p>
These photographs have the psychological effect of reminding the viewer
of some of her or his most thoughtlessly private moments and invite
us to wonder if something meaningful might not be attached to such
haphazard fiddling, in the way that Freud discovered that meaning might
be extracted from the recital of a person's dreams, the leftovers of
everyday activities. Could, in fact, truths about the self and about
humanity itself lurk in such "automatic" creations? Who would save
such things, let alone preserve them by photographing them? Are not
these images linked, in part, by their disposability? Are they perhaps,
like the broken pots so closely examined in archeological excavations,
the everyday trash that reveals and identifies us as a people&#8212;the
detritus that marks an era: in the detailed scroll design on the first
bus ticket, for example, which would no longer be made with such care? And
do they have aesthetic value?

<p>
I will begin to answer the question of the aesthetic value of these
photographs with my own subjective response to them. The fifth photograph
struck me as strangely beautiful when I first looked at it on its own
at the Brassa&iuml; retrospective in Paris in the summer of 2000.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 At first glance I thought it was an enlarged photograph of an exotic
 flower, of the sort immortalized by Karl Blossfelt in <i>Documents</i>.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 I admired what I took to be its glossy petals and wondered whether it
 might not be one of those floral carnivorous oddities: an insect-eating
 plant. Only after checking the label did I learn what the photograph
 was of&#8212;an accidental blob of toothpaste. The label repeated the
 <i>Minotaure</i> caption by Dal&iacute;: "the morphological chance
 quality of smudged toothpaste does not escape delicate and ornamental
 stereotyping."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
This revelation, which made me laugh, prompted me to go backwards
and forwards in the exhibition to the others of these "sculptures"
and to look at them more carefully, with their label identification in
mind. Thus what Dal&iacute; calls an "elementary" rolling stopped being
a mysterious cigarette, the ornamental bread was no longer a stone
goddess, the soap bubble ceased to resemble blown glass, just as the
toothpaste dab had become un-transformed and had lost its identity as
an exotic blossom. And yet my new view of these unmasked images remained
haunted by my first impression. They remained, for me, almost like those
psychological double or "reversible images," like the two faces and the
urn or the young beauty and the old woman, which can be described as
"anamorphic" because they represent two images in one which cannot be

<b></b>

apprehended fully in a single glance. In the case of Brassa&iuml;'s
"involuntary sculptures" it had to do with the scale of the photographs
and with the manner of their distortion.

<p>
Shot in such tight close-up and enlarged, with an almost irrationally
lavish attention, these objects are literally transformed by their framing
into more than the ephemera that they are&#8212;bread to be eaten; rolled
bits of paper to be thrown out with the garbage&#8212;having outlived
their usefulness as signs of minor economic transactions. What is more,
rarely would a person, particularly an adult, see these objects in such
an intimate way. And that intimacy, that spectral sense, is part of what
makes these "sculptures" surrealist, because, like surrealist "found"
objects, they seem almost animate and organic.

<p>
I believe that that is what I was seeing when I mistook the blob
of toothpaste for a carnivorous flower&#8212;I was seeing a "being"
where there ought to have been none. When Brassa&iuml; wrote in 1950
that photography was the art of giving "things the chance to express
themselves" he was arguing that objects contained communicable messages
which he attempted to reveal, even if he was also perpetrating a visual
joke in the spirit of Salvador Dal&iacute;, whose essay on Art Nouveau
architecture, designated by the name "Modern'Style" in an abbreviated
form of the French for Art Nouveau ("Modern Style"), these photographs
precede and, to a limited extent, illustrate. For despite the fact
that a reading of the pseudo-scientific/art-critical captions probably
composed by Dal&iacute; for Brassa&iuml;'s photographs elicits laughter,
there remains the uncanny sense that by making us look twice at these
disposable bits of ordinary urban life, Brassa&iuml; succeeds in making
them come alive.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 They seem eerily to communicate "involuntarily," and, as it were,
 thus to produce a visual version of automatic writing. Rosalind Krauss
 argues this when she proposes that the surrealist photographer's frame
 "announces the camera's ability to find and isolate what we could
 call the world's constant production of erotic symbols, its ceaseless
 automatic writing."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Furthermore, with the echo they conjure between contemporary everyday
objects and archeological discoveries from the historical past, these
"sculptures" combine the sense of historical and ahistorical time typical
of ethnographic modernist thinking.

<p>
In their three-dimensionality, Brassa&iuml;'s "sculptures" resemble
the wild flights of fancy embodied in the Art Nouveau architecture so
admired by Dal&iacute;, partly because in this style, too, Dal&iacute; saw
automatism at work. In "De la beaut&eacute; terrifiante et comestible de
l'architecture Modern'Style," beginning on the page facing Brassa&iuml;'s
"sculptures," Dal&iacute; claims that, like the surrealist object,
Art Nouveau architecture awakens a sense of desire in the viewer who
responds to both its latent psychic and evident physical qualities. It
is the product of the transformation of past styles, through a "formal,
convulsive" "birth," into a new style that is so utterly "impure" it
paradoxically attains the highest degree of "immaculate" purity, with
its dream-inspired curves. For him, the manner in which it provokes
desire is directly, and humorously, linked to hunger: Art Nouveau
architecture makes buildings look like cakes, which, far from being
problematic, for Dal&iacute;, enhances their appeal and accentuates
their "hyper-materialization" of the instinctual urges in which all
supposedly "ideal" desires are rooted. Art Nouveau architecture embodies
"continuous erotic ecstasy," and consequently is utterly anti-rational,
even "hysterical."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The wild, "convulsive" psychological effects of Art Nouveau architecture,
which, Dal&iacute; acknowledges, is held to be the epitome of bad
taste by most of his contemporaries, adds weight to my contention that
Brassa&iuml;'s preceding "sculptures," (three of which are explicitly
described as showing "Modern'Style" characteristics), were understood
by Dal&iacute; and Brassa&iuml; as strangely animate. Unlike surrealist
objects, however, Brassa&iuml;'s mysterious "sculptures" have no "life"
beyond the photograph. Reduced to their actual size, they would lose their
power; they would probably no longer seem haunted and would return to
being trash. Similarly, several of the tribal artifacts featured in the
second issue of <i>Minotaure</i>, devoted entirely to the Dakar-Djibouti
mission, would have lost their magical potency once the ceremony for
which they had been created was over, according to anthropologists. For,
as art historian Thomas McEvilley insists:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In their native contexts these objects were invested with feelings of awe
and dread, not of esthetic ennoblement. They were seen usually in motion,
at night, in closed dark spaces, by flickering torchlight. . . . [M]any
primitive groups when they have used an object ritually (sometimes only
once), desacralize it and discard it as garbage.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus these ephemeral "sculptures" exemplify most precisely the
junction of ethnographic and aesthetic perspective representative of
<i>Minotaure</i> and the surrealist group in 1933 ("TEOA," 134). They
show how deeply Brassa&iuml; had internalized the conceptual functioning
of tribal art and reflect the extent to which he understood the tricky
union and division bonding and separating an ethnographic sensibility
to and from a surrealist one. These works are beautiful, but only in
the instant of distortion permitted by the photographic moment, which
stands in mechanically for the ritual ceremony that transforms tribal
art into awe-inspiring icons. The ritualizing event is equivalent to
the photographic process. After the images were taken, the toothpaste
and soap would have been cleaned up and washed away, like the tribal
masks thrown out after the ceremony for which they were created. These
photographs endow the real with the surreal.

<p>
Brassa&iuml;'s photographs focus the ethnographic gaze on the Parisian
"participant observer" and invite Western viewers to reconsider their
own culture in light of discoveries made about others. These works are
typical of modernist and surrealist ethnographic thinking because of the
ways in which they conflate what is timeless because ancient with what
is temporal because contemporary, a stone goddess with an ornamental
bread roll. They make us aware that sometimes what we hold sacred are
exactly those things we tend to take most for granted, that an ornamental
bread roll <i>can</i> be beautiful and, albeit fleetingly, as precious
as a newly discovered piece of ancient art. At a UNESCO banquet in 1963,
Brassa&iuml; remarked that "the <i>surreal</i> exists within us . . . in
the things which have become so banal that we no longer notice them,
and in the <i>normality of the normal</i>."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Beginning with the tarot cards on the cover, number 3-4 of
<i>Minotaure</i> invites the reader to see latent forces at work
everywhere we look. As Brassa&iuml; writes in the opening sentences to
his essay on graffiti: "Everything is a question of optical focus. Living
analogies establish vertiginous rapprochements across the ages by the
simple elimination

<b></b>

of the factor of time" ("DMDC," 6). What is caught in time can be seen
anew by a release from temporality into timelessness. It all depends on
how you look, which, in conclusion, sums up the entire thrust of this
issue and of its ethnographic thinking: juxtapositions, like accidental
meetings or coincidences, can make the receptive participant observer
"see, really see," as Andr&eacute; Breton had claimed about chance seven
years earlier, in <i>Nadja</i>.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 And seeing anew the mundane, mixing the timeless and the temporal,
 defamiliarizing the familiar in order to recover its lost originary
 magic, was, in many ways, what surrealism was all about. Furthermore,
 Brassa&iuml;'s non-verbal focus on seeing brings surrealism back
 to modernist ethnographic thinking, at least the way Frank Kermode
 describes it in "Modernism, Postmodernism, and Explanation" in which
 he emphasizes modernism's focus on looking.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Kermode characterizes one of Freud's accomplishments, and Wittgenstein's
ambitions, as compelling the reader "to undertake a change of aspect,"
to come to a new level of understanding of the familiar ("MPAE,"
361). This "change of aspect" resembles Eliot's dual reading of time
as both timeless and temporal because of the way it refers to the
modernist way of seeing influenced by ethnographic thinking which
impells the viewer to see something once, and then again under a
different "aspect," and thus to understand that not everything can be
logically "explained." What Kermode concludes about literary modernism
as influenced by ethnographic thinking could also be proposed about
Brassa&iuml;'s photography in <i>Minotaure</i>: "Thus there grew up a new
veneration for art that leaves out, and so has a chance of containing,
the unutterable. . . . Hence there is a sense that to represent the
truth . . . is to write what must be looked at, rather than explained"
("MPAE," 366). Brassa&iuml; made his viewer look at the obvious in new
ways, rendering visible that which had become invisible in everyday life.

Bourgeois distinctions between high and low culture were abolished by
surrealist journals, as Roger Cardinal notes: "Whether in the voluntarily
austere format of the <i>R&eacute;volution surr&eacute;aliste</i>, which
parodies the solemnity of scientific publications, or in the luxurious
format of <i>Minotaure</i>, rich in color plates, the surrealist journal
has always had the audacity to everything that cultivated French taste
would have rejected as obvious impurities" (see Roger Cardinal, "Les Arts

Rubin, <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art I.</i>, 32, 73. Rubin,
in turn, was accused by Thomas McEvilley of de-contextualising tribal
art in his <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art"</i> exhibition
at the Museum of Modern Art in 1984 and in his catalogue. However,
despite the problematic fact that the tribal pieces are not dated in the
catalogue, Rubin and other contributors do make the distinction between
"tribal" art and how it was used by Western artists who considered it
"primitivist." Rubin explains that "the tribal sculptor creating ritual
objects for a cult had no consciousness whatever of aesthetic solutions"
(see Rubin, <i>"Primitivism" in 20th-Century Art</i>, 28) while arguing
for what he calls "affinities" between the goals of Western and tribal
artists: to attempt to make visible an ivisible inferior force.

In <i>Picasso and Company</i>, Brassa&iuml; described the surrealist
attraction to the Minotaur as to "the force which shatters the limits of
the rational, flooding across its frontiers, tearing down the laws and
offending the gods. They identified him with their own aspirations:
constant and universal violence, absolute revolt, total defiance,
unbridled liberty" (See Brassa&iuml;, <i>Picasso and Company</i>, 9).

The surrealists collected them in part because of their representations
of the (at least) double nature of human beings, as Elza Adamowicz
argues: "Putting into play surrealism's double aim, of integration
and disintegration, of totalization and fragmentation, the mask, that
equivocal space and re of alterity, is the place of the appearance
of the other within the same, of the apparition of the surreal in
the heart of the real" (see Adamowicz, "Un Masque peut en masquer (ou
