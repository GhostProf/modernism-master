I want to start, and end, with the illustration, or visual model, that accompanies this meditation on "Irrational" "Man" in Kenner, in Beckett (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). During the well-attended clash of those critical titans, J. Hillis Miller and M. H. Abrams, at an MLA convention long ago, Abrams, reflecting on Miller's deconstructive linking of language to the abyss, pointed out that in New Jersey, where he grew up, <i>word</i> was pronounced <i>void.</i> A picture, then, can be worth a thousand <i>voids</i>; at least it may be in this case. The combined image was inspired by the passage in Beckett's <i>Molloy</i> concerning the "joy of crutches" and the "peace" of <i>pi,</i> whose graphic representation in the Greek alphabet, as the illustration makes clear, can resemble crutches.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Molloy has been thinking about a silver object he once possessed and perhaps still does, whose purpose he knows he will never know. He says that when you know "you are beyond knowing anything," "peace enters . . . the soul of the incurious seeker": "It is then the true division begins of twenty-two by seven for example, and the pages fill with the true ciphers at last." But not wanting to "affirm anything on the subject," Molloy shifts attention to the "rapture . . . in the motion crutches give." The ciphers (variously meaning Arabic numerals, representations of zero, and encoded scripts) fill the page because &#x003c0;, which stands for the value of 22/7, is the name of a conundrum, the name of an irrational number, one whose decimal expansion neither terminates nor repeats periodically. 

<b></b>

The silver kniferest, with its supports and crossbar, becomes linked to &#x003c0;, with its vertical lines and horizontal bar, which we can associate visually with the character on his supporting crutches.</p>

<p>
My attempt to translate visually the passage's strange conjunctions is in the mode of Duchamp, as a transforming marking on a re from Leonardo, his Vitruvian man. There is a strangeness in the passage, meant to be reflected in the illustration, that Hugh Kenner recognized and evoked in his writing about modernist literature, especially once he began publishing monographs on Beckett. In one of my first (infrequent) conversations with him, in the late 1970s, Kenner commented about my attempt to turn my dissertation into a book that "writing a book is a strange activity." I do not think that he meant only that writing a critical book is strange. He meant that writing books <i>per se</i> is strange. By confirming that truth, Kenner's writings fold the riddle of our own challenging strangeness into our understanding of modernism, literature, and culture. An expert on mathematical enigmas, Kenner gave the title <i>Mazes</i> to a late collection of essays, and the final words of <i>The Pound Era</i> are "Thought is a labyrinth" (<i>TPE,</i> 561). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The persistence of enigmas is worth stressing on a panel that bears the title "Where are we now?" When we were first organizing this roundtable, someone suggested that we "historicize" Kenner. I responded that "historicize" rhymes with "apologise," as that word occurs in the verse Stephen Dedalus apparently hears or remembers when he feels threatened in the opening pages of <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>: <i>"Apologise, / Pull out his eyes, / Pull out his eyes, / Apologise.</i>" The inevitable, necessary historicizing of Kenner need not distract us from recognizing his work's arrestingly unusual character. I do not mean that his writing is peculiar in a derogatory sense. It is strange, but no stranger than we are. My own answer to the question "Where are we now?" is the answer as well to a query that Leopold Bloom remembers in the Ithaca episode of <i>Ulysses</i>: "Where was Moses when the candle went out?"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  That question stands in the response position following one posed by the (as Beckett might say: what is the wrong word?) narrator, a question about an enigma, which the response concerning Moses, itself a question, names. We encounter literally "an answer that questions and a question which answers," as Roland Barthes defines "literature," which he also calls "mantic," in "The Structuralist Activity."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Though no answer is provided in "Ithaca," it must be: "In the dark." Those words render where we are now, and not just with regard to <i>modernism.</i>
</p>

<p>
Kenner's writings become more obviously strange when he begins his sustained critical engagement with Beckett. I have made the case in more detail elsewhere that Kenner's writing about Beckett in the 1960s contributed significantly to his producing two important books. <sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  They are the widely-read, highly influential <i>The Pound Era</i>  and the comparatively neglected meditation on counterfeiting and the ontology of the work of art, <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , because of which <i>The Pound Era</i> became possible after a long period of uncertainty. No one, including Kenner, could have imagined that he would write either <i>The Counterfeiters</i> or <i>The Pound Era,</i> based on the character of his writing before 1961 (books on Chesterton, Pound, Lewis, Joyce, and Eliot, plus <i>Gnomon,</i> containing 19 essays), when his transforming engagement with Beckett began. The catalyst for <i>The Pound Era,</i> where Beckett plays only a small overt part, includedpublication of <i>Samuel Beckett: A Critical Study</i> , <i>The Stoic Comedians</i> , where Beckett arguably plays a defining role, the second edition of <i>Samuel Beckett</i> , and <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , where Buster Keaton stands in for Beckett. Immediately after <i>The Pound Era,</i> Kenner published his second book on Beckett, <i>A Reader's Guide to Samuel Beckett</i> . His work on Beckett over a dozen years frames <i>The Counterfeiters</i> and <i>The Pound Era.</i>
</p>

<p>
The two surprising books take the forms they do not only because Kenner was responding to Beckett but also because he had begun collaborating with the artist and writer Guy Davenport (who died this past January). Davenport illustrated both <i>The Stoic Comedians</i> and <i>The Counterfeiters.</i> At this point in his career, Kenner began to act on a recognition that discursive language alone could not represent adequately the character of his subjects or the implications he was obliged to express. He recognized the limits of language as he had been using it. Visual representation became pervasively part of Kenner's method in <i>The Pound Era,</i> a book that keeps breaking into photographs,

<b></b>

drawings, reproductions of paintings, maps, and the calligraphy of Eastern and Western languages.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Lest anyone miss the point, the arresting drawing of a panther by Gaudier-Brzeska used on the dust jacket (and on the front and back covers of the first paperback edition) appears as well on the title page and then thirty-one times, in each chapter heading. The book's ending is pluralized as the closing chapter title, "Endings," and that chapter reaches nonclosure in two endings, the verbal reference to a labyrinth mentioned earlier and a photograph of Pound. The shift in Kenner's style, argumentation, and sense of page composition produces a text that, in Jennifer Wicke's words, "exhibits its nonlinear simultaneities by montage" (see her contribution above). What Beckett calls in "Three Dialogues" "the obligation to express" despite or because of being in the dark has produced a work warranting the response that "I don't know what it is, having never seen anything like it before."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  "Three Dialogues" suggests that, by contrast with the enigmatically new, most art remains "on the plane of the feasible" ("TD," 103), in the domain of what we think we know already, because it is driven by "a kind of Pythagorean terror, as though the irrationality of pi were an offence against the deity, not to mention his creature" ("TD," 125). Pythagoras was reportedly killed for challenging received wisdom; his companions threw him overboard when he shared his discovery of an irrational number. And that brings us back to the "Irrational" "Man" illustration.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Beckett's readers, that is, for us, Kenner rejected the existential humanist misreading of Beckett's works as representing modernity to be a situation of tragic alienation and misery. We can call that misreading, for short, the <i>irrational man</i> interpretation, using the title phrase of William Barrett's influential book on existential philosophy . Recognizing that Beckett was projecting something much stranger about what it means to be human under the conditions of modernity (including the Nazi genocide and the possibility of human self-destruction by technological means), Kenner wrote about Beckett from the beginning in ways that drew on two apparently incommensurable elements, the tradition of the clown and mathematics.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The mathematical vector turns cybernetic in <i>The Mechanic Muse,</i> when Kenner represents Beckett's writing on the page visually in a way that approximates the programming language Pascal and claims that one of Beckett's sentences is "written in a proto-computer-language" (<i>TMM,</i> 94, 96). Kenner has in view in his late readings of Beckett the crossover between the human and the machine that he began writing about in <i>The Counterfeiters.</i> By suggesting with the language of computers that Beckett has moved beyond the world of "transparent technology" inhabited by modernist writers, Kenner as a critic has stepped overtly into a postmodern situation that Beckett himself experienced (<i>TMM,</i> 15).
</p>

<p>
The human has merged with technology to become something different from anything we can formulate with assurance discursively. The <i>irrationality</i> frequently associated with existentialism is more inviting of description than the elusive so-called irrationality we encounter in Beckett, which pertains to the unfathomable human technology of mathematical concepts, such as pi. Those concepts differ from tools for gaining mastery that we think we can possess and control. Rather than knowing and controlling, we merge with an irresolvable enigma that turns the illusion of closure into 

<b></b>

plural endings. Instead of being singular and knowable, "Man" turns out to be, centaur-like, a creature of diverse couplings and compounds. The endings without closure that Beckett comes to represent in Kenner's late work are captured by the title of the final chapter of <i>A Colder Eye</i> , which focuses on Beckett: "The Terminator." For Kenner, Beckett is the end of modernism, the point at which it stops and something else begins (though "end" can also mean goal). But <i>The Terminator</i>  is famously the title of a film and then of an unstoppable film franchise concerning cultural anxieties involving humans and machines, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, a contemporary cultural icon of "Man," who plays the role of a machine. It seems improbable that Kenner could have had Arnold's terminator as cyborg in mind in a work published a year before the film was released. He could not have known the book, because the film was not based on a prior work of fiction of that name. Nevertheless, Kenner applied the word to Beckett and simultaneously recognized the postmodern crossover between human and machine in Beckett's response to a world that Kenner shared with him and with us. We see the crossover in Molloy and his bicycle, in Molloy and his crutches, in Molloy and pi as "Man" the "Irrational," and in Beckett as practitioner of computer language and as terminator. There is a cyborg in Beckett, and in Kenner. Thanks to cybernetics and the computer technology that has transformed us, I am obligated, and not unhappy, to express my discursive formulations as a mirror-resembling, machine-generated image of that "Irrational" "Man."

I would like to thank Marie-Anne Verougstraete for producing the illustration, Vitruvian Pi / "Irrational" "Man." Inspired by the writings of Vitruvius (a Roman architect of the first century B.C.), Leonardo drew "Vitruvian Man" (now in the Accademia, Venice) around 1490 in pen, ink, and watercolor over metalpoint. Like Vitruvius, Leonardo took man as the measure of all things, specifically as a model for understanding the universe because of the human body's supposedly rational geometry, its parts all related by specific proportions, which Leonardo, following Vitruvius, describes (see Martin Kemp, ed., <i>Leonardo on Painting,</i> trans. Margaret Walker [New Haven: Yale U Pr, 1989]:120&#x02013;22). In the illustration, following Beckett, I have irrationalized Leonardo's rationalized image of the human by fusing it with the traditional symbol for the irrational number that can also be represented by 22/7.

Even in <i>The Pound Era,</i> with its diverse illustrations, Kenner implicitly acknowledges Davenport's influence by citing him centrally (<i>TPE,</i> 249&#x02014;misindexed as 349) in "The Stone," the final of fourteen chapters in the long first part, concerning Gaudier-Brzeska, whose works are by far the most frequently presented in the book.
