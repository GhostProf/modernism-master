<p>
Few res loom larger in the modern imagination than the
engineer.
Invoked as
the emblem of a dreamed-of immediate linkage between art and
life, as
embodying
the new norm to be followed by less technically grounded
practitioners of
thought
or art, and as an idealized agent of orderly
democratization, the engineer
hovers
at the center of the revolutionary fantasies of the
avant-garde. In the
famous
1923 pamphlet in which he identified the Bauhaus with the
will to erect the
"cathedral of socialism," Oskar Schlemmer called reason and
science the
"regents"
of the present era and the engineer "the sedate executor of
[their]
unlimited
possibilities."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
His was that "idealism of activity that
embraces,
penetrates, and unites art, science, and technology, and
that influences
research, study, and work [so as to] construct the
'art-edifice' of Man,
which is
but an allegory of the cosmic system."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Likewise in Le
Corbusier's
1920 program for a new architecture, engineering leads and
architecture
follows:
"The engineer's Aesthetic and Architecture are two things
that march
together and
follow one from the other: the one being now at its full
height, the other
in an
unhappy state."
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
He continues: "Working by calculation,
engineers
employ geometrical forms, satisfying our eyes by their
geometry and our
understanding by their mathematics; their work is on the
direct line of
good art"
<I>(PMA,</I> 59). Off the direct line of good art,
architects have instead
mired
themselves in ornamentation, the false beauty of secondary
forms. Their
present
task is thus to return to practical geometries: to "arrive
at the
'House-Machine,' the mass-production house, healthy (and

<B></B>

 morally so too)
and
beautiful in the same way that the working tools and
instruments which
accompany
our existence are beautiful" <I>(PMA,</I> 62)--to become, in
short, the
executors
of the unlimited possibilities opened up by modern
technology. As already
indicated, the modernist concept of engineering bears within
it rative
extensions into the domains of individual and collective
subject formation,
morality, spirituality, and even a utopic, human-centered
cosmology. Hence
for
the Left Front of the Arts (LEF), led by Osip Brik and
Vladimir Mayakovsky,
"constructivism must become the highest formalistic
engineering of all
life."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Hence also for the self-designated man of steel,
Joseph
Stalin, the once "useless" writer was to become an (at least
rative)
engineer
working in the service of the supreme engineer, the builder
of the State:
"We
need engineers who build living quarters. We need engineers
who build
automobiles
and tractors. But we need engineers just as much who build
men's
souls."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Many other instances could be cited, but the point would
remain much the
same.
The modern movement consecrated the engineer's
passage--carried out during
the
second half of the nineteenth century--from the periphery to
the center of
the
industrial world, from the status of a mere technician, the
passive
implementer
of visions of others (poets, politicians, generals, social
reformers) to
that of
socio-political visionary, at once creator and protagonist
of modern
times. This
event's impact has been well studied in the American,
German, French, and
Soviet
contexts, but less so in that of Italy, where even so
vigorous a proponent
of
industrial civilization as the Futurist movement clung to
what remains, at
base,
an individualized model of production resistant to
routinization and
rationalization. For all its celebration of modern machinery
and mechanized
humankind, Futurism rejects analytical reason and tends to
imagine all
manufacturing as artistic creation, the latter usually
understood as a
solitary
act carried out by the titanic individual of late
romanticism. It thus
thinks
mass production in terms not of the proletariat's genius as
marshaled by
and
embodied in the engineer, but instead in terms of a
"proletariat of
geniuses": a
proletariat of Prometheus-like heroes of the everyday life
world, each
endowed
with full autonomy. Cast in a similar mold, Italy's Fascist
decades have
often
been found wanting in the scientific-technical domain.
"Fascism," wrote
the great
physicist Emilio Segr&egrave;, "was substantially
indifferent to science,
which
it did not understand. It recognized a few of its applied
aspects and,
especially, its publicity value, but not the relations
between science and
technology."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
While probably true in Segr&egrave;'s own field,
statements of this sort underestimate the decisive role
performed if not by
"pure" scientists, then by technicians and engineers in
Italy's
conservative
revolution. Repeatedly dubbed by Mussolini "the category [of
workers] that
best
embodies the morality of fascist times" <I>(la categoria che
meglio
impersona la
moralit&agrave; del tempo fascista),</I> engineers were
often among the
truest
believers in the Fascist cause.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Most eagerly embraced the
regime's
ambitious program of public works projects and shared the
view of the
national
secretary of their union that "our engineers, because they
are in regular
contact
with the people, have the feeling that they have been
appointed
fiduciaries,
propagandists, and popularizers <I>(divulgatori)</I> of
Mussolini's word.
Ours is
less a technical role than a <I>practical political
role."</I>

This essay tells the story of one such practitioner. Not a
mainstream
practitioner, to be sure, but a symptomatic one who strove
to translate a
Fascist
politics into the language of modern technics in the domains
of
architecture,
theater design, animal husbandry, and transportation
systems. The engineer
in
question, Gaetano Ciocca (1882-1966), achieved considerable
renown during
the
1930s (<a href="2.3schnapp_1.html"> 1</a>). Author of <I>Giudizio
sul
bolscevismo,</I>
<I>Economia di
massa,</I> and <I>La strada guidata,</I> as well as of an
influential body
of
essays; close friend of Pietro Maria Bardi, Ernesto Rogers,
Valentino
Bompiani,
and of other prominent writers and architects; inventor of
the "fast house"
<I>(casa rapida)</I> and of the "guided street" <I>(strada
guidata),</I>
Ciocca
dedicated himself to building a new society through
technical innovation.
This
enterprise took him from the battlefields of World War I
through the
Fascist era
through the period of postwar reconstruction and, therefore,
raises
important
questions regarding the interconnections between Italy's
Fascist and
post-Fascist
eras. But his activities during the 1930s and 1940s form the
core of his
biography, for during those decades Ciocca emerged as a key
mediator
between
Fascist Italy and the countries that he considered the "two
most genuine
representatives of class capitalism": the Soviet Union and
the United
States.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In his writings on these two countries, Ciocca
contributed
to defining the much vaunted "third way" to
industrialization that the
Fascist
regime claimed to have discovered. In his mass theater
projects, published
in
important reviews such as <I>Quadrante</I> and <I>Meridiano
di Roma,</I> he
responded to Mussolini's call for a theater of masses for
masses: a
theater much
like that which Ciocca had encountered in the Soviet Union,
but
Italianized and
Fascistized. In his architectural experiments he devised
new, industrially
produced peasant and worker housing units, rational in
design and entirely
prefabricated. In his ventures into animal husbandry, he
brought to the
agrarian
world the same enthusiasm for rationalization and
standardization that he
had
brought to the design of corporatist city plans, fast
houses, and 

<B></B>

 mass
theaters.
Finally, he labored tirelessly--and mostly in vain--to bring
about his most
ambitious dream: the construction of nationwide
transportation system of
self-steering vehicles on guided roadways; a system that
would reconcile
the need
for mass transit with private circulation, the collectivity
with the
individual.
Whether in this cluster of undertakings or in his important
contributions
to the
postwar reconstruction of northern Italy, Ciocca lived to
the fullest his
personal ideal (and, not incidentally, that espoused by
Fascism) of an
activist,
praxis-minded intellectualism summed up by the phrase that
provides the
title for
his first contribution to Bardi and Bontempelli's
<I>Quadrante:</I>
"Against
Sedentary Intelligence" <I>(Contro l'intelligenza
sedentaria).</I>

II. An Italian Engineer in the Land of Soviets
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Ciocca completed his engineering degree at the University of
Turin in 1904
and
devoted his earliest years (1905-15) to working on steering
and suspension
components for railway cars. He served with great
distinction in World War
I,
participating in the battles of the Carso and Vittorio
Veneto, building
roads,
hospitals, barracks, anti-nerve-gas defenses, and radio
antennas, and
devising an
ingenious bridge-building method that he would later patent.
By his own
account,
the first shadowy glimmerings of what would later become the
guided street
entered his mind on these Alpine battlefields: battlefields
on which the
army's
recourse to fleets of individual trucks, each of which
required costly
refueling,
inspired fantasies about lengthy truck-trains pulled by a
single tractor
and
guided by rail-like structures.

<p>
Ciocca's transportation ideas came to slow fruition in the
course of the
interwar
decades. In the immediate postwar years, he developed
patents and worked
as an
engineer and consultant for the city of Milan on city
planning, public
housing,
and mass transit projects, and for his hometown of Garlasco
on several
drainage
and land reclamation projects. Ciocca's forays into these
and other areas
of
civic and mechanical engineering led to collaborative
ventures with Fiat
(the
Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), and these, in turn, to
a contract
with
Fiat's RIV (Villar Perosa) division in June 1930 with the
twofold charge
"first,
of overseeing the design of our Moscow factory for the
production of ball
bearings and, second, of overseeing its construction and
start-up phase. .
. .
"
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
The responsibilities in question were very substantial,
given
Ciocca's relative inexperience in the domain of
manufacturing, and were to
have
entailed a three-year commitment. The RIV factory was to be
the world's
largest
production facility of its kind, larger than even its
Detroit counterparts
and
more thoroughgoing in its integrated approach to
ball-bearing manufacture.
It was
to be built, as was then standard Soviet (and Fascist)
practice, at
breakneck
speed, so that it could be featured as one of the crowning
achievements of
Stalin's first Five-Year Plan. Last but not least, it was a
key component
in
another five-year plan: that devised (and successfully
realized) by Fiat
to break
the virtual stranglehold enjoyed by American companies such
as Ford on
industrial
development projects with the Soviet Union. 

<B></B>

<p>
Stimulated by the Wall Street crash of 1929 and by the
apparent death
knell that
it sounded for economic liberalism, the early 1930s were a
period of
worldwide
fascination, fear, and expectation with regard to the Soviet
economy. And
nowhere
more so than in Fascist Italy, where Mussolini's regime was
putting into
place a
system that, by coupling workers and capitalists within
state-sponsored
corporate
units, each responsible for a given sector of the economy as
well as for
coordinating their policies at the national level, was
purported to offer a
"third way" to industrial development, combining the
advantages of Soviet
centralized planning with those of liberal decentralization.
"Moscow or
Rome?"
was the question of the day, at least in the minds of many
Fascist
intellectuals,
and in the words of one contemporary journalist, "among the
human
endeavors of
the present day, the Five-Year Plan is, at least in its
conception, the
most
intriguing and perhaps the most important."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The regime's
special
interest in its Bolshevik enemy twin was, however, also of a
practical
order.
Italian exports were sagging as the Great Depression began
to deflate the
Italian
economy, so a series of measures were implemented to promote
exports,
particularly of capital goods, to new or underdeveloped
markets like the
Soviet
Union.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
In short, the stakes of Ciocca's charge were both
corporate
and national.

<p>
<a name="2" href="2.3schnapp_2.html">
<img align="left" hspace=5
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_2t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

Within days of Fiat's offer, an accelerated design process
was underway.
Fiat's
owner-founder, Giovanni Agnelli, demanded a state-of-the-art
production
facility,
and Ciocca delivered. And quickly so: "The overall project
that you asked
me to
devise in forty-eight hours has remained intact right to the
end," Ciocca
would
later brag, adding that "This overall design has redeemed
even
technological
weaknesses" (<a href="2.3schnapp_2.html"> 2</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
The weaknesses in question emerged as a
source of conflict several months later, when Ciocca
initiated his two-year
residency in Russia. They were not machine related, but
rather hinged upon
Ciocca's rigid insistence that "a clear sequential and
systematic
synthesis of
the [manufacturing] technologies in use" be developed <I>ex
novo</I> so as
to
allow for a full rationalization of the production line.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
"This task
can be addressed only by an intellect that, accustomed to
bringing
clarity, is
unbiased by standard work habits" Ciocca would argue, making
a virtue of
his
inexperience: a position that bred dissent among his more
experienced
peers as
well 

<B></B>

 as among his Russian clients,
all of whom favored a less global, more
pragmatic approach.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Aggravated by the Russians' tendency to
worry
less about efficiency than about meeting unrealistic
production deadlines,
the
rift grew to the point that, by July 1931, the Soviets were
demanding that
a
genuine specialist in manufacturing take charge of the
factory's start-up
phase.
A personal plea by Senator Agnelli (also in July 1931) was
unable to alter
their
view, so Ciocca soon found his contract restricted to the
construction
phase of
the factory.

<img align="right" hspace=5
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_3t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

However painful, the shift in duties proved congenial to
Ciocca, since it
freed
him up to introduce his two great passions--the development
of new
transportation
systems and of rationalized building techniques--into the
RIV project. In
subsequent months Ciocca carried out experiments with
prefabricated worker
housing in addition to his usual duties. Most of all, he
secured the
necessary
patents, ensured the collaboration of another Fiat engineer
(A. Piccin),
and
developed plans for the construction of the first <I>Autovia
Ciocca</I>
(Ciocca
roadway) in the Soviet Union. This futuristic system, later
known as the
"guided
street," proposed to place trucks and tractors on rails in
order to link up
Moscow's suburban factories and city center at reduced cost
and with
increased
efficiency (<a href="2.3schnapp_3.html"> 3</a>,
<a href="2.3schnapp_4.html"> 4</a>). Ciocca's ideas were in line
with contemporary
experiments being carried out in England, France, and

<B></B>

 Germany. His aim was
to
create an intermediate form of transportation between the
train and the
automobile. In Ciocca's own words:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The development of a new transport system is a matter of
some urgency.
Such a
system would have to be significantly cheaper than either
roadways or
railways.
It should be able to substitute either in most cases: in the
case of
trains,
furnishing heavy-duty, intensive, long-distance
transportation; in the
case of
automobiles and trucks, providing brief light-duty service
to isolated
locations.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The solution was to devise "not a motor vehicle suited to
railways, but
rather a
special roadway for automotive trains," a roadway that
allowed ordinary
trucks,
tractors, and trailers to circulate on inexpensive
reinforced concrete
tracks.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
An upraised inner wall was to have kept the truck and
trailer wheels aligned, with steering for heavy vehicles
provided by pairs
of
lateral rotors extending down beneath the vehicle's track
rods and pressing
against the inner wall of each track. Other technical
features of the
<I>Autovia</I> will be discussed in due course, but for
present purposes
it is
worth noting that Ciocca and Piccin's proposal was greeted
with anxiety by
Fiat
and with enthusiasm by the Soviets. The former wished to
dissociate itself
from
what it (correctly) viewed as an unproven technology and
proceeded to do
so by
forcing Ciocca to leave Fiat's employ. The latter appointed
Ciocca
director of an
experimental unit, funded by the state companies Ziat and
Zudotrans, whose
mission was to realize the guided street. Construction of a
twelve
kilometer wood
prototype that was to link up a railway station to two
quarries was
initiated
between May and September 1932 and seemed to have been
yielding mostly
satisfactory results. But from that moment on construction
ceased and
Ciocca was
forced to return to Italy.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
<a name="5" href="2.3schnapp_5.html">
<img align="right"
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_5t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

Despite the many conflicts, detours, and obstacles
encountered along the
way, the
RIV factory proved an outstanding success. Ground was broken
in the spring
of
1931. The lateral structures and outbuildings were up by
late October
(<a href="2.3schnapp_5.html"> 5</a>).
In early January 1932--the "allegorical date" established
long in advance
by the
Soviet authorities--the first ball bearing was duly
manufactured, even if
it had
little more than "scholastic value."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
And less than a year
after it
was begun, the complex, in the form of a vast single hall
surrounded by
outbuildings, was inaugurated. A stately ceremony was held
on 29 March
1932 that
included representatives of the Soviet government, the Red
Army, the
Communist
Party, youth organizations, the Italian ambassador, and the
world press. It
featured Ciocca as its keynote speaker. Our engineer had
received his
letter of
dismissal from Fiat only two hours before the ceremony, so
he was feeling
more
than a little disgruntled. But his commitment to the
<I>Autovia</I>
project kept
him eager to please his Russian hosts and to sing the
praises of Italian
discipline and technology. His speech, reported in the press
above a
subtitle
that read "The Americans Express Admiration," cast the
undertaking in a
distinctively Fascist mold. It celebrated the close
collaboration of
Italian and
Russian engineers, praised the accelerated pace of
construction, and
described
the factory as if it were a Mussolinian <I>bonifica</I>
(land reclamation
project): "One year ago, there were only swamps where now
there are worker
houses, tramway lines, and vocational schools."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Ciocca
continued by
noting that the new facility's technology was unequaled
anywhere--surely a
barb
directed at the Ford Corporation, Fiat's American rival--and
that it
offered the
most modern solutions available in the domains of hygiene
and worker
safety. The
speech closed by noting the importance of training Soviet
engineers and
workers
to run the plant.

<p>
The triangular frame of reference implicit in the keynote
speech, based
upon the
study of convergences and divergences between Fascist Italy,
Communist
Russia,
and liberal-democratic North America, is indicative of the
way that Ciocca
viewed
his entire Soviet experience. Indeed, this very triangle
would shape the
two
books that established Ciocca's reputation as a writer and
cultural-political
mediator: <I>Giudizio sul Bolscevismo</I>  and
<I>Economia di
massa</I>
. The former's subtitle was <I>Com'&egrave; finito il
piano
quinquennale</I> (How the Five-Year Plan Came to Term) in
keeping with its
key
concerns: collectivization and the role of the state in
economic planning.
It
enjoyed such immediate popularity that it underwent six
printings between
August
1933 and February 1934. Beefed up as of the second edition
with prefaces by
<I>"Il Popolo d'Italia"</I> (Mussolini) and Pietro Maria
Bardi, Ciocca's
book
became the defining work of the "Russian journey" genre: a
genre whose
success
can be measured by the existence of similar travelogues by
Bardi, Corrado
Alvaro,
Mirko Ardemagni, and V. Beonio-Brocchieri, among others, and
by the
publication
in Italian of works such as Ren&eacute;
F&uuml;l&ouml;p-Miller's <I>The
Face of
Bolshevism</I>  and Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker's
<I>The Soviet
Five-Year
Plan</I>  and <I>The Menace of Red Commerce</I>
. As regards
Ciocca's
study of the new economy of masses (to be contrasted with
prior "economies
of
privilege"), limitations of 

<B></B>

 space
preclude my going into detail, but
suffice it
to say that the acclaim garnered by <I>Giudizio sul
bolscevismo</I> was
such that
the Italian Royal Academy decided to honor Ciocca with a
grant so that he
might
extend his study to the American continent. This he did in
the course of
1934 and
1935, and the result was not a travelogue--Ciocca had spent
barely four
months in
New York--but instead a theoretico-practical study of
industrialization and
economic rationalization in which the American case was
examined
critically and
comparatively.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
Whether in the first or the second of these works, Ciocca's
fundamental
concern
was with the link between modernization and specific forms
of political
organization. He viewed modern industrial societies as mass
societies in
which
privileges once reserved for the few were increasingly being
extended to
the
many, but how to reconcile the drive to democratize
prosperity with the
pursuit
of a higher collective good? How to curb the activities of
socio-economic
agents
such as oligarchies, trusts, or an omnivorous state, which
would diminish
the
collective's prosperity by restricting its economic freedom?
Ciocca's
answer is
at once technical and ethical. It calls for "the courage of
dictatorship, a
heroic remedy to kindle the collective will by means of the
spark provided
by a
single will."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
A dictatorship whose natural extension is the
corporate state:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The need for a newly ordered state, able to regulate
economic freedom and
to
engage in advance planning, arises in this manner. All
governments, from
free-market America to collectivist Russia, are cognizant of
this fact.
But in
both Russia and America we see the state limiting its
purview to the purely
material aspects of production, as if the individual were
entitled to
define his
economic needs yet were deemed incapable of satisfying them.
This is the
opposite
of the truth. . . . It is up to the State to create the
context in which
individuals operate and up to individuals to operate within
that context.
Individuals cannot encroach upon the sphere of action of the
state any
more than
the state can encroach upon the sphere of action of
individuals without
upending
the fundamental economic principle of the division of labor.
The solution
is thus
neither a <I>state of capitalists</I> nor <I>state
capitalism,</I> but
rather
state initiatives and private initiatives converging with
and completing
one
another. The first [state initiatives] create the
possibility for power;
the
second [private initiatives] transform this possibility into
a
reality.

Moscow, New York, and Rome were for
Ciocca the three
laboratories in which the future of humankind was being
prepared. Hence the
"special interest for Italians" of his two case studies.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The
transition from a class-based economy, whether capitalistic
or
communistic, to a
fascist economy required an avoidance of predecessors'
errors. In the case
of the
Soviet Union, the lesson Ciocca gleaned was that, however
powerful a tool
is the
centralized planning of production according to national
needs, it cannot
right
the imbalances created by a state that has abolished all
private property
and,
therefore, all individual economic incentives, and in so
doing has
impoverished
the masses and subjected them to the whims of a bureaucratic
elite. In the
case
of America, the lesson was instead that the state's
abdication of any
central
planning role left the collectivity at the mercy of enormous
trusts
operating at
cross purposes with the national interest. The result was a
tyranny of
individuals akin to 

<B></B>

 the bureaucratic
tyranny exercised by the Soviet
government.
Proof of these failures could be found in the bread lines of
Depression-era
America and in the fully (under)employed and impoverished
Soviet work
force. But
the diverging symptoms concealed a common malady: "Russia
and America are
today
the two most genuine representatives of the <I>capitalism of
class</I>
that arose
in the course of the last century to replace the traditional
<I>capitalism
of
caste.</I> They have adopted the same program: to
excessively concentrate
and
mechanize production, thereby reducing all social and
economic questions to
matters of industrial accounting" <I>(GSB,</I> 25).
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
This
reduction
bespeaks a shared spiritual poverty:

Russia, on the one side, and the great plutocratic nations,

They are both under the spell of the same miraculist mirage

prospect of
unlimited,
nearly inevitable progress along prosperity's open orbit. In
nature there
are no
orbits that don't come full circle, no rectilinear
trajectories, no
absolute
principles, no simple formulas for happiness. The force of
things bends all
trajectories and that which is launched towards infinity is
fated to come
tumbling down into the contentious circle of the real. [GSB,

Here and elsewhere in <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo,</I>
Ciocca's intention
is to
differentiate the acritical worship of the machine
purportedly practiced by
Americans and Soviets from the "realistic" approach to
technology ushered
in by
fascism and adopted by practical politicians like himself.
For Ciocca
"realism"
implies a sober, practically grounded approach to technical
solutions that
views
modern technology and science not as ends in themselves, but
as means to a
higher
collective good. It demands a rejection of utopic
expectations regarding
technology and an intensive concern with addressing actual
social problems,
however intractable they may prove. It eagerly seeks out
mechanical,
utilitarian
or functionalist solutions to what ails humankind but,
keenly aware that
human
existence must always be defined by deprivation, work, and
struggle, and
that
nature's laws are irrevocable, it is immune to the
"miraculist mirage" and
wary
of the quick fix. Technological realism dictates moderation
so as to
insure that
the Fascist "third way" to modernity will escape the
pathological
consequences of
the first and second ways:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Fascism] consists in cooperation inside the orbit of the
state among all
the
forces active within society, whether individual or
collective, whether of
the
body or of the mind. These are brought together in order to
insure that the
nation's productive energies achieve maximum results and
that the resulting
benefits are distributed in a manner that is both equitable
and in keeping
with a
collective good; a collective good that is less material
than it is moral
and
whose ultimate expression is the nation's spiritual grandeur
and power.

Ciocca's state steers a middle course between liberal
statelessness and
communist
statism, between hypertrophic individualism and hypertrophic
collectivism,
between the pursuit of material prosperity and of spiritual
grandeur. Its
moderate approach 

<B></B>

 yields increases in
efficiency inasmuch as the state is
strong
enough to gather within itself all productive forces, but
not so strong as
to
diminish their productivity. Like a supercharged engine, it
is able to
transform
this collective input into a maximum output that, optimally
redistributed
back
into the input stream, contributes in turn to sustaining
ever higher
outputs.
What it generates and, for that matter, feeds upon, is not
reducible to the
materials, statistics, and statistical persons favored by
industrial
accountants.
Rather, it is a volatile blend of body and spirit--a
<I>moral</I> capital,
identical to the spiritual totality that is the nation.

III. The Theater of the Masses
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Some six months following Ciocca's return to Italy,
Mussolini addressed the
members of the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers
(SIAE) and
summoned them
to create a mass theater that would "arouse the great
collective passions,
be
infused with a sense of intense and deep humanity, and bring
to the stage
that
which truly counts in the life of the spirit and in human
affairs."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The crisis of the theater, <I>il Duce</I> averred, was
neither inevitable
nor
insuperable. Nor was it the result of the triumph of film as
a popular art
form
or of the masses' greater passion for athletic competitions.
Its resolution
demanded both "spiritual" and "material" answers:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The spiritual aspect concerns authors, the material aspect
the
availability of
seats. The time has come to prepare a theater of masses, a
theater able to
accommodate fifteen or twenty thousand [persons]. La Scala
was adequate
when, a
century ago, Milan's total population equaled 180,000
inhabitants. It is
not
today when the population has reached one million. The lack
of seats
creates the
need for high prices which drive the crowds away. But
theaters, which, in
my
view, possess greater educational efficacy than do cinemas,
must be
designed with
the people in mind, just as dramatic works must have the
breadth that the
people
demand.

<p>
Ciocca had not yet completed <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo</I>
at the time of
Mussolini's speech (April 1933). An open letter to the daily
newspaper
<I>L'Ambrosiano</I> defending Bardi's Moscow dispatches
against
accusations of
filo-Sovietism had helped to earn him a place among the
founding
contributors to
Bardi and Bontempelli's <I>Quadrante.</I> Established in May
1933,
<I>Quadrante</I> managed for nearly three years to bring
together the
leading
advocates of a modernist interpretation of Fascist culture.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
It was
an openly polemical, militant monthly whose articles covered
a wide
spectrum of
cultural-political topics, from architecture and urban
planning to
contemporary
literature, music, and dance. Along with its successor,
<I>Meridiano di
Roma</I>
(started in December 1936), it became the principal venue
for Ciocca's
contributions on theatrical, architectural, and economic
arguments, and was
largely responsible for his reputation as one of the most
inventive
technical
interpreters of the Fascist revolution.

<p>
Ciocca had no prior experience in the domain of theater
design. His Soviet
sojourn had coincided with the 1931 competition for the new
Palace of the
Soviets
in Moscow, a key component of which was a
fifteen-thousand-seat auditorium
for 

<B></B>

party functions. So Ciocca had occasion to view the losing
projects
submitted by
Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Hans Poelzig, Erich
Mendelsohn, and by Blum,
Lubetkin, and Sigalin, as well as the winning one by Boris
Jofan.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In addition, several passages in <I>Giudizio sul
Bolscevismo</I> confirm
Ciocca's
fascination with Soviet stadia, theaters, and cinemas, as,
for instance,
the
following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Among the thousand Soviet contrasts, the most telling is
that between the
gloomy
monotony that oppresses the average citizen in his family
life and the
mirthful
excitement of collective events. In cinemas and theaters,
the audience,
always
unbelievably overflowing, constitutes a spectacle unto
itself. It
enraptures the
performers and is enraptured by them. [<I>GSB</I>, 167]

The strong impression made by the large size of Soviet
audiences and by
their
electrifying response to theatrical shows prompted Ciocca's
decision to
answer
Mussolini's April 1933 call. Between July 1933 and January
1935 he
published nine
major statements on this subject, as well as a range of
supplementary
newspaper
articles. These varied from brief synopses to full-scale
technical
proposals,
accompanied by technical drawings and by calculations
regarding sight
lines,
acoustics, and crowd flow (<a href="2.3schnapp_6.html"> 6</a>,
<a href="2.3schnapp_7.html"> 7</a>). All envisaged a
large-scale
covered
arena, similar to contemporary indoor stadia, built
according to strict
geometrical principles. The basic design consisted 

<B></B>

 in two intersecting
circles:
one large, marking the periphery of a concentrically
arranged seating area
comprising a floor area as well as balconies; one small and
centered on the
perimeter of the larger circle, functioning as a stage. The
theater's walls
(twenty-seven meters high) sloped downward into the hall,
such that the
diameter
of the floor was somewhat reduced (ninety-two meters) with
respect to its
upper
diameter (one hundred meters). A network of spiraling
corridors, wide
enough to
permit the passage of only one person at a time, ensured the
rapid but
disciplined inflow and outflow of spectators. (Scientific
crowd-flow
studies were
one of the era's passions.) Rejecting the window-box stages
of the prior
century,
Ciocca's theater employed a very large semicircular thrust
stage (forty
meters
wide) that reduced the orchestra pit to a bare minimum and
jutted out some
thirty
to thirty-two meters into the auditorium. It initially
assumed the form of
a
three-part stage, each of whose parts could slide along
parallel tracks
(into and
out of the auditorium), rotate (on or off the parallel
tracks), and be
lifted up
(for the initial preparation of sets on a second floor tech
studio).
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Subsequent designs increased its size and replaced
the
track system with a bipartite rotating platform. In either
case, Ciocca's
stage
was designed to both minimize and equalize the distance
between spectators
and
actors, to reinforce the sense of immediacy and even
intimacy (despite the
massive scale), and to underscore the life-like three
dimensionality of
the show
(<a href="2.3schnapp_8.html"> 8</a>). For too long, he argued,
theaters
have
flattened
reality out
into two
dimensions, "like a flower between the pages of a book"
("ITM,"
8).
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The mass theater would instead bring absolute reality to the
stage:
"Everything
appears, just as it should, in three dimensions: trees are
trees, houses
are
houses. The stage director need concern himself only with
arranging . . .
the
true images of things" ("ITM," 8).
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Like many other
proponents of
the Fascist mass theater, Ciocca assumes that the artful
arranging of "true
images of things" within the theater's compressed and
intensified reality
will
yield a spectacle form as hallucinatory as the cinema, yet
more seductive
and
complete, because anchored in the palpable reality of the
body.

The early 1930s were a period of enormous stadium-building
projects,
whether in
Italy or abroad. So Ciocca's studies not only found a
receptive audience
but
seemed 

<B></B>

 modest when compared to
proposals like Pier Luigi Nervi's for the
construction in Rome of a stadium for one hundred twenty
thousand
people.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Their impact on public debates concerning the
"theater for
twenty thousand" was substantial, to judge by coverage in
the Italian,
French,
and even Japanese architectural press; and by the
seriousness with which
they
were discussed at the 1934 and 1935 Lictorial Games of
Culture and Art
<I>(Littoriali della Cultura e dell'Arte),</I> an
intellectual Olympics for
Fascist university students.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Substantial enough, in any
event, to
determine Ciocca's inclusion in one of the major
international theater
conferences of the decade: the 1934 Volta Congress on the
theater.
Presided over
by Luigi Pirandello and sponsored by the Italian Royal
Academy, the Volta
Congress brought together men such as Edward Gordon Craig,
William Butler
Yeats,
Walter Gropius, Walter Unruh, Maurice Maeterlinck, Jacques
Copeau, Gerhardt
Hauptmann, and Alexander Tairoff for a five-day discussion
of the dramatic
theater's past, present, and future. The Italian delegation
included a
Futurist
contingent made up of Anton Giulio Bragaglia, Enrico
Prampolini, and
Filippo
Tommaso Marinetti; the critic Silvio d'Amico, and the writer
Bontempelli
(like
Marinetti and Pirandello, a member of the Royal Academy).
Ciocca's name
had not
red on the original list of invitees, a star-studded
cast that included
Federico Garcia Lorca, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Eugene O'Neill,
Karel Capek,
and Paul 

<B></B>

Claudel. It was added at Pirandello's insistence because of
the "great
competence" with which his publications had addressed the
topic for the
second
day: "Theater Architecture: Mass Theaters and Little
Theaters."
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Because both he and Gropius were assigned to the same panel,
Ciocca's Volta
Congress presentation followed directly upon that of the
Bauhaus's founder
(concerned with the Total Theater that he had designed for
Erwin
Piscator). It
bore the title "The Technique of the Mass Theater" <I>(La
tecnica del
teatro di
massa) </I>and examined the features that a facility with
the requisite
visibility, acoustics, capacity, economy of construction,
and ease of
entry and
exit, would have to possess. Illustrated by technical
diagrams and by a
large
wood model built especially for the occasion, it generated
one of the
Congress's
most animated and publicized debates: a debate in which
Ciocca and Gropius
found
themselves lumped together and praised for the audacity of
their technical
solutions but criticized for putting the horse before the
cart (<a href="2.3schnapp_9.html"> 9</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Why design such a facility, the critics objected, when no
repertory for the mass theater yet exists? Shouldn't
<I>authors </I>rather
than
<I>architects </I>take the lead?

<p>
Ciocca responded to his critics in essays published in
<I>Quadrante </I>and
<I>Corriere della Sera.</I> In revolutionary times, he
argued, questions of
precedence are irrelevant: "In the case of the theater . . .
the real
question is
what would occur if large cities had at their disposal an
auditorium
equipped for
every possible type of spectacle and capable of seating
twenty thousand
spectators."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Ciocca's answer brought him back to Mussolini's
original example: the Teatro della Scala in Milan. If La
Scala, he
reasoned, were
able to place its shows on a mass stage every weekend, it
would be able to
multiply its audience by a factor of ten and reduce its
ticket prices by
the same
factor, without any loss in income and without renouncing
its weekday
performance
schedule. Such an operation would not only democratize what
was once an
elite
cultural form, but also generate new revenues. All that it
required was the
elimination of all the inefficiencies of bourgeois theater
architecture,
so that
the same quality of spectacle enjoyed by La Scala's patrons
could be made
available to the maximum number of spectators at the lowest
possible cost.
Rationalization was the first step towards democratizing
elite culture. The
second step was to devise so flexible a theater architecture
that it could
be
adapted to every sort of show, from rallies to cinema to
dramas and
operas. The
final step was to foster the development of new mass
political/cultural
forms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Above all else, the mass theater is a political, social, and
cultural
weapon of
the greatest efficacy. . . . It could host parades, great
corporate and
popular
assemblies for the diffusion of propaganda, films that
enlighten
culturally,
grand operatic and musical performances, eternal sources of
joy and of
spiritual
elation for the masses. And why not plays? I believe that
the greatest and
most
enduring dramatic works, from Sophocles to Shakespeare,
were destined for
the
masses. The matter has nothing to do with geometry, but let
me state that
I feel
certain that a glorious future awaits the Italian dramatic
theater.
Marinetti was
right when he expressed the wish that erotic plays and
thrillers be
banished from
the Italian stage. The mass theater will instead exalt
energy, struggle,
speed,
and progress. It will reawaken faith and arouse a new
corporatist
consciousness.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
Despite their technical nature, Ciocca's
theater
writings do not shy away from defining the model of
spectacle required by
the new
corporatist consciousness. The model in question, instead of
relying upon
the
effects achieved by individual actors, demands mass
choreographies and
choruses
not unlike those employed in ancient Greek tragedy but
dedicated to the
celebration of Humanity triumphant (and not of Fate).
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Parades lead
the list of its sources of inspiration, because they are the
"synthesis of
the
work of the collectivity, the glorification of the people's
labors, the
expression of the nation's passion" ("ITM," 10).
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
In parades
the
mass theater fulfills its highest calling. The mass audience
is invited to
gaze
upon itself, as if in a transring mirror: "While twenty
thousand
admiring and
applauding spectators cram the hall, thirty thousand others,
gathered
backstage
and under stairwells, file across the stage amidst bright
lights and
flashing
screens: a prize to men of good will, an incitement to tepid
souls, a
warning to
doubters" ("ITM," 10).
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
This narcissistic gaze promises
release into
pre-Oedipal bliss or threatens exclusion and eventually
punishment. It
structures
a theater within which there can be no gap between
auditorium and stage,
mass
audience and mass actor, or, for that matter, fantasy and
reality--a
theater that
is the allegory of a corporative nation that has little room
for waverers
or
doubters.

<p>
  Whether in his Volta Congress address or in his other
writings, Ciocca
identified his mass theater designs with architectural
rationalism (the
label
employed in Italy to denote the International Style):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When geometry is applied to architecture, the latter assumes
the name of
rationalism. The Coliseum and the Roman acqueducts, to this
day the most
compelling instances of rationalist architecture, are
geometry pure and
simple.
The false rationalisms that sometimes afflict us are little
more than false
geometry, erroneous theorems, logical receptacles riddled
with holes. What
I
propose to do is to demonstrate how a strictly geometrical
method, based
on a
simple and clear set of norms, can resolve all the problems
entailed by the
construction of a mass theater. But to discover <I>a
method</I> is not to
discover <I>the method</I>. Better solutions will be found
tomorrow.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Bardi, Terragni, Nervi, and others had long ago devised the
stratagem of
countering the antirationalist attacks of cultural moderates
(like Marcello
Piacentini) and conservatives (like Ugo Ojetti) by
emphasizing
rationalism's
Mediterranean roots, sometimes straining the limits of
credulity. But in
the
hands of an engineer, much of whose lifetime had been
devoted to designing
canals, sewage systems, and drainage projects, the praise of
Roman
acqueducts was
surely genuine.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Evidence to this effect may be found in
Ciocca's
arena, whose circular contours suggest a tilted, streamlined
version of
Rome's
Coliseum. But it is important to note that, for Ciocca, the
connection was
founded on sound engineering and design principles (not
iconography). His
direct
sources of inspiration were the great assembly hall of Le
Corbusier's
Palace of
the Soviets and various Soviet theaters (among them that in
Kharkiv).
These he
freely expanded upon and modified, rejecting, for instance,
Le Corbusier's
recourse to microphones, in favor of the "natural"
projection of music 

<B></B>

 and
human
voices according to meticulous acoustical calculations.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
True
to his
training, he devoted a great deal of effort to the
mathematical study of
audience
flows according to the principles of hydraulics in the
pursuit of "the
minimum
possible exit time from the theater."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Just as in the design
of the
RIV ball-bearing plant, Ciocca's goal was to devise a
modern, fully
integrated
facility, of the highest possible efficiency at the lowest
cost: "not the
cavern
of Cacus that are traditional theaters, but a spectacle
factory, clean,
orderly,
and luminous like a modern factory" ("ITM," 9).

In the months following the Volta Congress, Ciocca's theater
seemed on the
verge
of becoming a reality. On 10 January 1935 he wrote excitedly
to Bardi:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Now I have to tell you in all confidentiality that,
according to a reliable
source, an extremely wealthy Milanese industrialist appears
ready to
shoulder the
theater's costs. The same source claims that the Comune is
prepared to
cede the
needed land. . . . It appears, moreover, that it will be
necessary to put
this
industrialist in direct touch with the head of the
government, in order
that a
conversation with Mussolini provide the springboard.

Eight days later, a deal appeared imminent, even if its
shape had changed:

would approve the construction of a theater financed by a
small number of
major
Lombard industrialists. How can we find this out? It would
be best to have
a
face-to-face conversation, but who should speak to him?
Bontempelli, me or
you?

Another four months passed and, by his own account, Ciocca
was still
"receiving
requests [for offprints of his Volta address] by persons of
good will who
are
talking about its construction. Even the Japanese are
interested!"
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
A contemporaneous letter to Vittorio Mussolini, il Duce's
son, indicates
that his
sights were still set high: "Italy needs twenty theaters for
twenty
thousand: one
for every two million inhabitants: 400,000 seats in all."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
All this
came to naught. Of Mussolini's involvement in the
construction of Ciocca's
theater little is known, and even less so of Japanese
interest; neither
twenty,
nor ten, nor even one arena was ever built.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The spectacle
factory
was fated to remain on its inventor's drawing board, despite
<I>Meridiano
di
Roma's </I>attempts in 1937 to relaunch the mass theater
movement and
Ciocca's
continued publications on theater architecture.
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
If Ciocca
failed in his first great architectural enterprise, he
mostly succeeded in
his
second. This is perhaps attributable to the fact that his
active
involvement in
housing and urban planning issues stretched back into the
early 1920s. As
early
as July 1921, for instance, more than a year before the
March on Rome, he
had
drafted an ambitious study, entitled "For the Resolution of
the Building
Crisis,"
which 

<B></B>

 proposed a proto-corporatist
solution to the nation's housing woes:
the
creation of a public entity that would "summon not just
capitalists or
workers,
but workers and capitalists" to address jointly the grave
problems faced
in the
area of social housing.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Many public works projects later, the
expertise he had developed in Milanese city planning issues
led to his
being
asked to join BBPR--the noted architectural firm of
Belgioioso, Banfi,
Peressutti, and Rogers--to assist in the design of a radical
new
"corporatist"
city plan for Pavia. (The plan was rejected, but Bardi
transformed it into
a
major cultural event by devoting an exhibition to it at his
influential
Galleria
del 

<B></B>

 Milione [<a
href="2.3schnapp_0.html"> 10</a>].)
But, however
great was Ciocca's devotion to
planning and
building the corporatist city, his deeper commitment was to
rural Italy
and, in
particular, to the agricultural world of his native
Lombardy.

These ruralist convictions came to a head in early 1935.
Prompted in part
by his
North American travels (which had included suburbs and
farming districts),
in
part by a desire to transplant the period's city-based
architectural
debates in
soil that was at once more familiar and politically fertile,
Ciocca
undertook
construction of a prototype rural house at Cascina Valbona,
a <I>bonifica
</I>located in the outskirts of Garlasco (<a
href="2.3schnapp_1.html">
11</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
This
model home
approached the question of rural housing in the integral,
totalitarian mode
demanded, Ciocca believed, by Fascist corporatism. "Half-way
solutions are
costly
and solve nothing," he would write, "they compromise the
full resolution of
problems."
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
His point of departure was, therefore, not
traditional
rural building types, but an entirely new kind of housing
specifically
designed
for Italy's peasantry: an attractive, modern, hygienic, and
extremely
inexpensive
house-machine developed with the same repertory of
techniques and
geometrical
tool kit employed in the RIV factory and mass theater
designs. The project
was
copiously documented, explained, and theorized in essays
published in
<I>Quadrante </I>under Ciocca's usual rubric of "Services to
Mussolini"
<I>(Servizi a Mussolini).</I> Bardi honored it with a series
of full-page
spreads, juxtaposing images of the clean modernist
machine-house with
decrepit
traditional peasant housing: a procedure he had followed
only in a few
prior
polemics. His tribute aroused jealousy within the circle of
architectural
contributors. But Bardi smelled victory: "rest assured," he
wrote to
Banfi, "if
we hit the jackpot on the rural house, all of
<I>Quadrante'</I>s
architects will
have plenty to do."
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
The hope was that the close fit between
the
regime's campaign to modernize Italian farming--Mussolini
had recently
spoken out
on matters of peasant housing--and Ciocca's practical-minded
project would
lead
to the latter's adoption on a national scale. If so,
Ciocca's rural house
might
become the means to a glorious end: the de facto adoption of
architectural
rationalism as the official corporatist style.

<p>
  The industrial mass production of housing had been one
the heroic
themes of
the modern movement in architecture, at least since Le
Corbusier's
<I>Towards a
New Architecture.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
But, with the lone exception of North
America, where prefabrication became well established soon
after the turn
of the
century, European architects approached it in a mostly
piecemeal fashion
until
the 1930s and 1940s. These years stand as the first golden
era of
prefabricated
building technologies and Ciocca's rural house is one of
this era's most
characteristic monuments. Its purpose was straightforward.
"If I succeed in
demonstrating that houses can be built with the same methods
that are used
for
building automobiles," he claimed, "I will have implicitly
demonstrated two
possibilities: that the benefits of mechanical progress can
be extended to
the
building sector and that homes can be perfected and
popularized just like
automobiles" ("SCR," 6).
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
In Ciocca's hands Le Corbusier's
"house as
machine for living" was to become a quite literal
house-machine,
improvable and
therefore expendable, and composed of 5,436 carefully
studied,
prefabricated
parts:

In this rural house, I have attempted to anticipate the
precise form and
position
of each piece, prefabricating the greatest possible number
of elements.
Where an
aperture is required, the piece is cast with an aperture.
Where a bracket
is
required, the piece is cast with a bracket. ["SCR," 17]

The 5,436 elements were reducible to an "alphabet" of
ninety-one precast
concrete
forms (<a href="2.3schnapp_2.html"> 12</a>). Their simplicity
of design
was
meant to
streamline the
assembly
process and reduce the time that it required:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

As is well known, the greatest advantage of rational
building procedures
is the
time savings that they allow. Fantastic results have been
achieved in
automobile
manufacture; the same can be done in the manufacture of
housing. During the
construction of my model home, I timed various operations
and was able to
determine that many tasks that now take five minutes could
be reduced to a
single
minute; hour-long tasks can be reduced to a mere two
minutes. Planning and
organization are all that are needed. ["SCR," 18]
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
These economies of labor were redoubled by Ciocca's careful
selection of
autarchic building materials. In line with the Fascist
government's latest
directives regarding Italy's economic autonomy, he sought to
sharply
curtail the
use of iron, "a material whose use we must limit in every
possible way"
("SCR,"
17).
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
Hinges, closures, and locks for doors and cabinets were
simplified and standardized. Rebar or 

<B></B>

steel reinforcements for the roof
were
abandoned in favor of wood beams and a light metal netting.
Utilities--water
supply, water heater, heating and cooling systems, sewage
and drainwater
pipes,
stove pipe; sinks, shower, and toilets--all were
concentrated in a single
central
wall, the house's "spinal column," so as to rationalize
their layout and
reduce
the need for steel tubing. The air and water heating systems
were
integrated into
the cooking facilities; all drainage systems--for rainwater,
bathwater, and
sewage--were unified. Like most of the edifice, sinks were
made of precast
cement: a cheap and protean building material whose
production required the
expenditure of far less carbon energy than its rivals brick,
terra-cotta,
or
ceramics. In Ciocca's pursuit of economy no detail could be
spared: even
the
varnish for built-in closets, window frames, and fenestrated
doors--to be
derived, he suggested, from used motor oil "which costs
nothing and works
perfectly" ("SCR," 17).
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
The result was a total cost, or so he
claimed, of only 7,000 Lire versus 35,000 Lire for even an
"ugly and
inefficient"
("SCR," 18) traditional house.

<img align="right"
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_3t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

The layout of Ciocca's house-machine prototype was spartan
and functional.
Consisting of two floors evenly divided by the central
utility wall, it
allowed
for five small rooms: three on the ground floor (a utility
room, a living
room, a
small bedroom); on the second floor, two bedrooms (one with
an oval
balcony) and
a bathroom. The two were joined by a spiral staircase that
doubled as a
stairway
to the roof (which was flat so as to permit the drying of
fruit and the
hanging
of laundry). The house's dimensions were extremely modest
(around seven
and a
half meters wide and six meters deep), but would grow in his
single and
twin
residence designs of the late 1930s (<a
href="2.3schnapp_3.html"> 13</a>).
Each abode
was to be
detached from
the landlord's house and surrounded by its own fruit and
vegetable garden,
so as
to grant a modicum of privacy. But each was envisaged as
part of a cluster
of
identical homes, homes that put on display the "aesthetic of
uniformity"
characteristic of the new corporative order.
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Such clusters
form an
idealized double of the Fascist city:

I am certain that when our economy will be fully regulated
by corporatism
. . .
we will provide new peasant housing with light, air,
adequate space, shiny
flooring, hygienic kitchens, heating, ventilation, cold and
hot running
water,
showers, flush toilets, built-in closets, all without
exceeding the
current costs
for providing none of the above. And every grouping of rural
homes will be
granted radios, newspapers, books, and maybe automobiles,
and thus the
possibility of attending every Sunday . . . the purest, most

peasants.

<p>
In Ciocca's rural utopia the mass theater occupies the place
once assigned
to the
church. Accessible to landlord and peasant alike thanks to
the
availability of
automobiles, it provides a place to worship a beneficent
state that aims to
extend bourgeois luxuries to the peasantry, but not to level
socio-economic
hierarchies. For all its collectivizing and standardizing
tendencies, the
corporative countryside is thus defined by a differentiated
approach to
planning.
To the popular classes it proposes a new aesthetics of
uniformity and
clustering;
to landlords, the same independence they have enjoyed over
the centuries,
but now
limited by the demand for corporate discipline and autarchic
restraint.

From the time that the Cascina Valbona prototype was built
through the war
years,
Ciocca worked on refining his designs. Certain of their
features had proved 

<B></B>

controversial: their use of flat roofs (ill-adapted to
Italy's northern
climes);
their deliberate ephemerality (being meant to be replaced
every forty
years);
their use of cloth partitions instead of inner doors; the
tendency of their
cement walls to sweat.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
But even his critics were ready to
grant them
the status of "revolutionary."
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Revolutionary or not, Ciocca
was
unable to persuade the ministries of agriculture, public
works, or the
colonies
to embark on the sort of massive building program he
envisaged (involving
the
construction of as many as one hundred thousand houses per
year). His
proposals
met a warmer reception in the private sector. Sample homes
or clusters of
homes
of various types were built in Vada, Ponte Ginori, Merano,
Garlasco, and
Condove,
for patrons such as the Solvay and Montedison corporations.
Encouraged by
this
success, he founded a corporation in 1938-39 for the mass
production and
marketing, both in Italy and abroad, of a variety of "Ciocca
Rapid-Built
Houses"
(Case Rapide Ciocca): single or double homes, one to two
stories in height,
buildable in as little as seven weeks time (<a
href="2.3schnapp_4.html">
14</a>).
Limited success was
again
achieved, but any hopes for a transition to large-scale
development were
undercut
by the outbreak of war.

<p>
Ciocca's integral solution to the problem of peasant housing
was, of
course,
integral only in part. Small clusters of rapid built houses,
no matter how
effective they might be in bringing dignity to a
disenfranchised
peasantry, did
little to rationalize Italian farming practices. This
realization prompted
Ciocca, during the very years of his housing experiments
(1935-42), to
undertake
a parallel set of experiments. From an operating base on the
Capanella
farm,
owned by the mayor of his native Garlasco, he set out to
reengineer
traditional
Italian farming. In the course of these labors he devised
and patented
several
inventions, among which a mechanical assembly that spun and
compressed hay
with
such force as to produce airtight cylinders that could be
stored in silos
for
extended periods. His principal passion, however, was for
animal husbandry:
initially involving geese, and later pigs. As Carlo Belli
would recall
many years
later:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
[Ciocca] finally succeeded in realizing his dream: a Grand
Hotel for pigs.
He had
fought long and hard for the idea, firing off studies to
Mussolini that
violently
denounced the vendors of pork for trafficking in
contaminated meat. Why so?
Because instead of being nourished rationally, swine were
fed everything,
at all
times, indiscriminately. Today's pig, he used to say, is a
building by
Piacentini; we must transform him into a building by Le
Corbusier. To this
end he
had built pristine and airy spaces, tidily furnished little
rooms. They
had a
straw bed, a toilet, and a special feeding trough that
permitted a . . .
stream
of food to advance <I>only up to certain point.</I> Then,
bam! A little
door
would shut so as to limit the pig's intake of food. (The
food was always
nourishing, clean, and in modest proportions.) Then there
was a small tub.
The
pig could hold down a small disk with his hoof and water
would spout as
long as
he kept pressing. The result was an absence of muck, filth,
etc. Ciocca
even
succeeded in training his pigs to shit and piss in the
toilet. . . . Right
after
eating and drinking, he would drive them towards the toilet
with a whip.
After a
few days the pigs would go without any prodding. In this
manner he achieved
unbelievable results: impeccable, bacteriologically pure
meat; swine that
instead
of being weighed down with unhealthy fat, were lean and
elegant in
appearance. 

<B></B>

 . . . But the project was discontinued
because
the swine
raised at the Grand
Hotel
weighed no more than sixty kilos, while those that been
raised on swill
weighed
well over a hundred.

Belli's portrait is accurate. In pig farming Ciocca found an
ideal
extension of
his housing work. If in the rural house one of his key
objectives had been
to
end, once and for all, the cohabitation of humans and
animals, then why
not also
rationalize animals' abodes? Why not create a porcine
"machine for living"
that
would also contribute to the well-being both of the peasants
involved in
pig
farming and of the consumers of pork? Such indeed were
Ciocca's goals as,
in
addition to devising Rationalist stalls, he carefully
analyzed every phase
of the
pig's life (<a href="2.3schnapp_5.html"> 15</a>). He developed
an annual
tracking system
for individual
porkers, which registered their girth and weight in relation
to their
dietary
intake.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
He experimented constantly with new combinations of
foods,
"always nourishing, clean, and in modest proportions." And,
although he
never
published on the subject, he was surely aware of the
symbolic reversal
that he
was attempting to effect. Ever since Book Two of Plato's
<I>Republic,
</I>in
which Socrates had contrasted his ideal republic with a
"city of pigs"--a
city of
day laborers and wage earners, dedicated alone to the
pursuit of base
carnal
appetites--Western societies have identified the pig with
abject filth,
sloth,
and excreta; with dangerous, undisciplined 

<B></B>

 muck--the muck of the
proletariat.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Through the alchemy of Rationalism, Ciocca
wished to
turn rative shit--whether proletarian, peasant, or
porcine--into
corporatist
gold.

During the years of his building projects, Ciocca's greatest
dream--notwithstanding Belli's statement to the
contrary--was <I>not </I>a
Grand
Hotel for pigs. It remained the construction of a
transportation system
that
would "eliminate the antagonism between the railway and the
pneumatic tire"
(<I>LSG,</I> 245).
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
In his 1939 volume dedicated to the
topic, he
would write, with characteristic fervor:

Today railways are in decline, but the perfection that they
have achieved
is such
that to replace them with a new system will be difficult and
will entail
tough
experiments, attempts, studies, and sacrifices. This said,
it is high time
that
we set out to confront and overcome every obstacle and forge
ahead
fearlessly,
because the problem of coordinating ground transportation by
introducing
something new and conciliatory between two entrenched
antagonists, the
roadway
and the railway, cries out for immediate attention. I have
written that the
nation that finds a solution to this dilemma will be
rewarded with the
sort of
economic hegemony that England enjoyed during the nineteenth
century,
thanks to
its belief in Stephenson and steamships. [<I>LSG,</I> 46]

The task of locating a nation-state courageous enough to
"forge ahead
fearlessly"
would prove daunting. First imagined on the Austrian front,
proposed to the
Italian ministry of war in December 1922, proposed anew to
Fiat in 1928,
nearly
realized in the Soviet Union in 1932, the path leading to
the construction
of the
guided street had already been a long one for Ciocca. And a
long one it
would
remain. The major stepping stones may be resumed as follows.
Between
October and
December 1935, a small circular track (eighty-five meters in
length) was
finally
built in Pavia at the expense of the ministry of war, and
was tested out
with a
truck, modified as per Ciocca's 1922 designs. The experiment
yielded mixed
results, leaving a ministerial commission unpersuaded
regarding the
system's
feasibility as a permanent substitute for roadways and
railways, but
impressed
with its potential as a provisional system for traversing
marshlands like
those
found in Ethiopia. So off went Ciocca (and voluntarily so)
to the
Ethiopian front
in February 1936. For the next ten months he served as chief
military
engineer in
Special Division S, adapting guided street principles to the
division's
transportation needs as it attempted to conquer remote
regions still under
rebel
control. His success was such that, after months of
wrangling in the wake
of his
return, three ministries--the ministries of war, the
colonies, and
communications--agreed to contribute one million Lire each
towards the
construction of a full-scale line, so long as Ciocca could
provide them
with
accurate budget res. This required, in turn, the
construction of a
full-scale
prototype, for which purpose he was able to secure the
sponsorship of an
interested party ("interested" because the guided street

<B></B>

 was to be built of
reinforced concrete): the Italian Federation of Cement
Manufacturers
(Federazione
degli Industriali del Cemento). An advanced prototype was
duly built at the
Federation head's estate of Casal Fogaccia, in the outskirts
of Rome, in
mid-1938, and included bridges, turns, level crossings, and
six-trailer
truck
trains (<a href="2.3schnapp_6.html"> 16</a>). Its performance
was deemed
highly
promising and was
documented
by contemporary newsreels in Italy and abroad, as were site
visits by
members of
the royal family (King Victor Emanuel, the Crown Prince) and
the Academy.

<p>
A momentary high point was attained with Mussolini's visit
to Casal
Fogaccia on
11 November 1938 (<a href="2.3schnapp_7.html"> 17</a>). Already
an admirer
of Ciocca, as
attested to
by his
glowing review of <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo</I> (reprinted
as a preface
to the
book's second edition), <I>il Duce</I> left Casal Fogaccia a
convert.
"This is
not a <I>roadway" </I>he affirmed approvingly, with military
applications
in
mind, "but rather a <I>railway."</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
He promptly ordered
that the
ministry of public works consider the substitution of
railways with guided
streets in Italian East Africa and that a first line be
built in Sicily.
Two
months later little had budged. So in early January 1939,
Ciocca requested
and
received a private audience, described in the following
letter to Count
Fogaccia:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
He [Mussolini] was visibly irritated at the lack of action
and, after a
probing
conversation . . . he asked if I had a plan. I told him that
my plan was
to found
a company, with capital from the IRI [Istituto per la
Ricostruzione
Industriale]
as well as 

<B></B>

 from private sources, that
would build and administer guided
roadways.
He then queried me on which ministry would be best equipped
to undertake
such a
project. I responded, naturally, "the ministry of
communications." Without
further ado <I>il Duce</I> phoned Minister Benni [minister
of
communications] to
request a meeting with Commander Menichella of the IRI to be
held the next
morning.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<a name="8" href="2.3schnapp_8.html">
<img align="right"
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_8t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

The meeting took place and, in spite of Mussolini's
pressure, revealed
little
interest on Benni's part in construction of a guided roadway
between
Diredaua and
Harar (Ethiopia). Menichella, on the other hand, seemed well
disposed and
proposed the substitution of the IRI-owned railway line
between Siracusa
and
Ragusa because "work could begin right away." Needless to
say, it did not.
A
March 1939 meeting with IRI technicians led to a shift in
lines, this time
from
Siracusa-Ragusa to Palermo-Monreale-Camporeale. Other
meetings followed,
but
ominous signs began to trickle in over subsequent months. In
late July,
the page
proofs of Ciocca's <I>La strada guidata</I> were returned to
his editor,
Valentino Bompiani, without deletions, but accompanied by
the statement
"the
ministry of communications expresses its reservations
regarding the
theories
developed in this volume."
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
Technical objections on the part
of the
National Council of Scientific Research (CNR) and the IRI
were soon to
follow. In
September and November 1939, panels of engineers
representing both
entities'
interest in the guided street project raised concerns about

<B></B>

 the resistance
of the
roadway's central cement railing, about the durability and
cost of
pneumatic
tires, about the availability of sufficiently light yet
powerful tractors,
about
the impact of weather and debris on a guided roadway, and
about its
adaptability
to African conditions.
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
By year's end the project was dead in
the
water. Ciocca persisted, designing a propeller-driven guided
street model
for the
<I>Mostra delle Invenzioni </I>(Exhibit of Inventions) held
in Milan in
the fall
of 1939 and continuing to seek out Mussolini's support
(<a href="2.3schnapp_8.html"> 18</a>). Thwarted
in
Italy, he avidly pursued patrons in Argentina, Iran, Italian
Albania, and
especially Nazi Germany, sending copies of <I>La strada
guidata</I> to
Field
Marshall Rommel and several other German military officials.
Two decades
later
Ciocca was still pursuing possible clients in Tunisia and
Brazil, and
securing
patents for his designs. The lone satisfaction that the
guided street
procured
him came in 1959 when the Milanese public transit
authorities adopted a
subway
system much like he envisaged. Despite its bearing the same
name (and
despite
some early consulting imput from Ciocca himself), all
references to the
creator
of the guided street were ommitted in the public
presentation of a
prototype car.
A dispute over patent infringements erupted that would drag
on almost until
Ciocca's death in 1966. 

<B></B>

<p>
The saga just recounted helps to explain why, as early as
1939, Ciocca
felt that
the "guided street has proved an odyssey for me, not across
the sirens'
azure
seas, but through offices and antechambers, and amidst reefs
of private
interests" <I>(LSG,</I> vii).
<sup><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
But the question remains: why
embark
on such an arduous journey? (A journey often undertaken at
considerable
personal
cost.) For Ciocca, the answer was less personal ambition
than
<I>faith</I>--a
faith that, with perhaps disquieting ease, was able to find
a home both
under
Fascism and under democracy:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When Stephenson built the first slow, weak, and imperfect
locomotive, he
could
never have imagined either the subsequent improvements or
the benefits
that it
would bring humanity. His confidence in the future of
railways derived
from faith
and not from practical details. As a matter of fact, faith
is the
conviction of
things unseen and, as of yet, impractical, even if they
remain certain. All
progress arises not out of cold calculations, but out of
faith in the
future of
humanity. [<I>LSG,</I> 44-5]
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The passage is revealing and applies equally to all of
Ciocca's technical
undertakings, whether before or after the war. Its
definition of faith
merges a
nineteenth-century credo of perpetual technical progress
with Catholic
eschatology. <I>Est autem fides sperandarum substantia
rerum, argumentum
non
apparentium</I> ("Faith is the substance of things hoped
for, the
conviction of
things unseen") reads <I>Hebrews </I>11:1, inviting the
faithful to
contemplate
the invisible but certain advent of the Eternal Jerusalem.
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
In
Ciocca's version, the invitation is tendered by an engineer
who is at once
an
empirical translator of the impractical into the realm of
practice and a
prophet
inhabited by a vision that can only be handed down in
imperfect form. Cold
calculation, planning, and practical details address only
his outer,
bodily eyes.
They are but the poor handmaidens of an inner
spiritual-technical eye
within
whose depths is reflected the higher goal: a better future
for humankind.

In the course of Italy's Fascist decades, this better future
was, for
Ciocca,
identified with corporatism. All his inventions, from mass
theaters to fast
houses to rationalist pig farms, strove to foreshadow and to
realize
corporatist
goals. The guided street is no exception. "The history of
transportation
systems
is one with the history of civilization" <I>(LSG,</I> 49),
Ciocca affirmed
in
<I>La strada guidata,</I> implying that the advent of a new
transportation
system
must always entail a reordering of the world.
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
In the case of
the
guided street, the system's very design is coupled tightly
to the "third"
way to
modernization celebrated in <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo:</I>

At the root of the antagonism between roads and rails stands
the conflict
between
freedom and constraint, between a liberty inherent to
roadways and a
constraint
inherent to railways. One doesn't have to be a philosopher
to understand
that all
physical or human actions occur in a context defined by the
interplay of
freedom
and constraint. Equilibrium too always occurs between
freedom and
constraint.
Accordingly, if we want to reconcile the truck and the
locomotive, we must
establish an equilibrium where now there is conflict by
balancing the
first's
freedom of movement with the second's subjection to rails.

Between anarchy and tyranny, between capitalist
individualism and communist
collectivism, between private sector interests and the
national interest,
the
guided street charts a corporatist middle course. In its
pursuit of
reconciliation between railway and roadway, it seeks to
eliminate neither.
Railways will continue to be built in the Fascist Eternal
Jerusalem, but
their
use will be limited to what they are best at: high-volume,
high-density
lines.
Roadways will also continue to built for use (mostly by
private parties) on
low-volume, low-density routes. Rather, Ciocca's faith
consisted in the
belief
that by creating a link between the two, the antagonism
would collapse and
in its
place would arise a unified three-tier system, held together
by its middle
term.
He believed that the guided street could function as a glue
because it
crystallized the values of efficiency, autarchy, and
discipline. Flexible
and
inexpensive, employing only "poor" building materials, it
was half as
narrow as a
highway and twice as flexible as a railroad. Both private
and state
vehicles
would be able to freely move on and off its network of
cement guide rails,
rejoining the roadway system at any given crossing. Once on
the network,
their
rate of movement could be standardized (thereby reducing
their consumption
of
fuel) as well as accelerated, since self-steering mechanisms
would reduce
the
driver's task to braking alone. Self-guidance would also
permit a
substantial
increase in the cargo-bearing and trailer-pulling capacities
of trucks.
Most of
all, movements along the grid could be someday be optimized
by
rationalizing the
roadway-railway-guided street links through central
planning: the "unity of
coordination will be absolute," Ciocca promised, and "will
make its
infinite
force felt in the case of war" <I>(LSG,</I> 249).
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
Like the
corporate state, the guided grid disciplines and directs
independent
forces; it
preserves their relative autonomy but molds them into a
single
transcendent will.
It can place the nation on autopilot because, in effect,
Mussolini is in
every
driver's seat.

<p>
So, like Ciocca's mass theater designs and rural housing
projects, the
guided
street is yet another allegory of corporatism. What, then,
is one to make
of the
fact that Ciocca also sought to build it outside of the
corporatist fold?
Nationalist motives might well provide the answer. But what
of its postwar
continuation or, for that matter, of the postwar
continuation of Ciocca's
other
projects, whether in Italy or abroad? Any response to this
question,
however
provisional, must begin with a brief sketch of his
activities during
wartime and
in the immediate postwar. Late in the conflict, as would be
the case with
many
other Fascist intellectuals and engineers, Ciocca's
allegiances shifted
abruptly,
perhaps out of frustration with the Fascist bureaucracy,
and/or antiwar
feelings
(in the 1960s he became an avid antinuclear activist and
esperantist)
and/or for
reasons of opportunism. The same practical politician who
had once
celebrated
Hitler as possessing the "genius and intuition of an
exceptional leader,"
thus
began an entirely new political practice by spying for the
Italo-British
regional
military command between September 1944 and April 1945
<I>(LSG,</I>
103).
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
No less significantly, between 1943 and the early 1950s
Ciocca became a key planner in the reconstruction of the
Lombard region
under the
Fanfani Plans of 1945 and 1949. That these activities
predate even the end
of the
world conflict is far more typical than atypical, to judge
by the special
issues
that Gi&ograve; Ponti's magazine <I>Stile </I>was 

<B></B>

 already devoting to
postwar
reconstruction in 1943-44.
<sup><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
In any event, by the end of 1945,
Ciocca
the rebuilder was every bit as active as had been Ciocca the
corporatist
builder.
But he had gained far greater momentum. On New Year's Day
1946, with Amos
Edallo,
Augusto Magnaghi, Luigi Mattioni, and Mario Terzaghi, he
presented the new
city
plan for Milan whose fourth article proposed "the
preparation of the
current
athletic zone for mass spectacles."
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
In September he stood
before
the first National Congress for Industrial Reconstruction
pleading for the
mass
production of prefabricated housing as a remedy for Italy's
postwar woes
and
filed a proposal for building "small serially produced
houses of rapid
construction" in Milan. Many projects later, he was building
the Necchi
corporation Garden-Village in Pavia: a worker housing
complex directly
inspired
by his designs of the 1930s, intended to demonstrate the
efficiencies that
could
be achieved via industrialized construction. By 1950, he had
resumed his
full-tilt campaign to spread the gospel of the guided
roadway. In the
mid-1950s
he returned to designing cinemas and auditoriums, drainage
canals and
sewage
systems. His tool kit was again complete.

<p>
If Ciocca's story has a moral it is surely that "the circle
of the real"
is far
more contentious and far less orderly than his own
socio-economic and
technical
fantasies would seem to allow. The credo of intellectual
activism,
intransigeant
nationalism, a "realistic" faith in the redemptive potential
of certain
technologies, a vision of the state as a forceful agent of
social
coordination
and reform, a populism always teetering on the edge between
autoritarianism and
democracy, an idealization of the engineer as political
practitioner: all
these
beliefs constitute a relatively solid (though not
necessarily coherent)
ground
that is layered over with shifting stories and symbolic
investments. It is
not
that the latter leave no trace in the technological
artifacts themselves.
Rather,
these traces are always fragile and prone to slippage.
Between the
corporatist
village and the Necchi garden-village of postwar Pavia,
between the rapid
rural
house of Garlasco and the rapid mini-houses of Milan,
between a nation
piloted by
a transcendental dictator and a republic piloted by a
sovereign people,
there are
real differences, the differences of which history is
composed. But they
are
differences that a half-empiricist, half-fideist dedication
to building "a
future
for humankind" can overcome.

Archival records seem to suggest two possible explanations:
a) that
the test

costs for the
guided
street would be greatly inferior to those for highways and
railways, so the
Soviets simply abandoned the experiment; or b) that the
initial results
were
promising enough to convince the Soviets of the guided
street's military
potential, which prompted them to demand exclusive control
over Ciocca's
patents.
In his subsequent writings Ciocca would claim the latter:

the idea

Gaetano Ciocca's project is a marvel not only from the
standpoint of its
practicality but also--at least to judge by the model--as an
architectural
monument. Yet I am troubled, let this rest among us, by the
strange
circumstance
that, as is typical of our era, architects and set designers
have stepped
forward
to solve the dramatic theater's problems before authors
could do so. What
I mean
to say is that these architects, however great a genius
Gropius might be
and
however great maybe my personal admiration for Ciocca,
sometimes give the
impression of having placed the cart before the horse.

Compare Nervi in his Roman stadium project:

Let's take as an example the building of a large stadium in

essential feature would be Romanity which, as I see it, can

by

the
powerful effect of a single rhythm shaped from structural
events, repeated
with
force.

realt&agrave; il suo grande progetto: un Grand-H&ocirc;tel
per porci. Si
era
battuto a lungo per questa idea, inviando a Mussolini
rapporti violenti
contro i
commercianti di carni suine, le quali, secondo certe sue
indagini, erano
tutte
inquinate. E perch&egrave;? Perch&egrave; ai porci si dava
da mangiare
tutto, in
qualunque momento e in qualunque modo; mentre si sarebbe
dovuto nutrirli
razionalmente. Il porco attuale--cos&igrave;
diceva--&egrave;
un'architettura di
Piacentini; bisogna farlo diventare un'architettura di Le
Corbusier. Per
questo,
aveva costruito certi ambienti pulitissimi e bene aerati,
specie di
stanzette
linde e giustamente arredate; c'era un letto di paglia, un
cesso, e il
trogolo
era fatto in modo tale che il cibo . . . vi scorreva <I>fino
a un certo
punto,</I> poi tac!, si chiudeva lo sportellino. Ci&ograve;
per regolare la
nutrizione, la quale doveve essere sostanziosa, pulita, e
non pi&ugrave;
che
sufficente. C'era poi una vaschetta: il porco spingeva con
una zampa un
dischetto
in terra e l'acqua scaturiva finch&egrave; la zampa premeva
il disco. In
questo
modo non si aveva liquame, sporcizia, ecc. Ciocca
dimostr&ograve; di essere
riuscito a educare il porco fino a fargli fare la cacca e il
pip&igrave;
al cesso
. . . . Appena finito di mangiare e di bere, in principio
gli dava una
bacchettata dolorosa avviandolo verso il gabinetto. Dopo
alcuni giorni il
porco,
ci andava senza alcun stimolo. Ciocca ebbe in tal modo
risultati
strabilanti:
carni pulite, batteriologicamente pure; porci non
appesantiti da grasso
malsano,
ma asciutti ed eleganti. . . . Ma il progetto non ebbe
seguito
perch&egrave; i
porci nutriti al Grand-H&ocirc;tel pesavano al massimo
sessanta chili e
quelli
nutriti di immondizia pesavano oltre i cento" (Silvia

"If you were founding a city of pigs, Socrates, what other
fodder than
this
would you provide?" asks Glaucus. The response involves an
inquiry into the
"origins of a luxurious city" to be compared with a city
dedicated to
austere
justice (Plato, <I>The Republic, </I>trans. Paul Shorey, in
<I>Plato: The
Collected Dialogues,</I> eds. Edith Hamilton and Huntington
Cairns

The original reads "La strada guidata annulla l'antagonismo
fra il
pneumatico
e la rotaia," and was the title of the final chapter of
<I>La strada
guidata.
</I>Earlier, he had invoked the notion of an epic battle:
"An epic battle,
enormous, without precedent. . . . They are two forces of
good who struggle
against one another like angels against angels, light
against light. One
has to
go back to Homer and the Trojan war to find anything like
this battle of
heroes
vs. heroes, gods against gods." (The original reads: "Lotta
epica, immane,
senza
precedenti . . . . Sono due beni, che lottano tra di loro,
angeli contro
angeli,
luce contro luce. Per trovare qualcosa di simile, bisogna
risalire a Omero
e alla
guerra di Troia, gli eroi contro gli eroi, gli dei contro
gli dei" <I>[LSG,
</I>67-8].)

The original reads: "Ora le ferrovie sono in decadenza,
&egrave; vero,
ma la
perfezione che esse hanno raggiunta &egrave; tale, che il
superarle con un
sistema nuovo &egrave; ben difficile, e occorrono dure
esperienze,
tentativi,
studi e sacrifici. E d'altra parte bisogna decidersi ad
affrontare e a
superare
ogni difficolt&agrave;, bruciando le tappe, perch&egrave; il
problema di
coordinare i trasporti terrestri, introducendo qualche cosa
di nuovo e di
conciliante fra i due irriducibili antagonisti, la strada e
la rotaia,
&egrave;
assilante. Io scrissi che la nazione che per la prima
risolver&agrave; a
fondo
questo problema avr&agrave; in premio quell'egemonia
economica che
gi&agrave;
ebbe nel secolo diciannovesimo l'Inghilterra, per aver
creduto a
Stephenson e
alla navigazione a vapore."

The statement is repeated and ritually praised at numerous
junctures
of <I>La
strada guidata: </I>"Il Capo del governo diede un suo

</I>nel quale
&egrave;
veramente l'essenza della strada guidata" (34; italics in

Gli risposi che il programma era di costruire una
societ&agrave; per la
costruzione e l'esercizio di strade guidate di emanazione

intervento anche di capitali privati. Alla sua domanda,
quale ministero

The original reads: "Quando Stephenson costru&igrave; la
prima
locomotiva,
lenta, debole e imperfetta, egli non poteva immaginare quali
miglioramenti
essa
avrebbe in seguito ricevuto n&egrave; quali benefici avrebbe
apportato
all'umanit&agrave;. La sicurezza nell'avvenire della
ferrovia, che lo
muoveva,
gli derivava non dagli argomenti concreti, ma dalla fede. La
fede &egrave;
appunto l'argomento delle cose che non appariscono e che
ancora non sono
concrete, pur essendo certe. Tutto il progresso &egrave;
derivato, non dai
freddi
calcoli, ma dalla fede nell'avvenire dell'umanit&agrave;."

Given Ciocca's tendency to pepper all his writings with
quotations from
Dante, his version may have been filtered through the
<I>Commedia:</I>
"fede
&egrave; sustanza di cose sperate / e argomento de le non
parventi"
(Dante, <I>La
Divina Commedia. Paradiso,</I> eds. Umberto Bosco and
Giovanni Reggio

The original reads: "Vi &egrave; dunque, alla base
dell'antagonismo
fra la
strada e la ferrovia, il contrasto fra una libert&agrave; e
un vincolo, una
libert&agrave; ingenita nella strada e un vincolo ingenito
nella ferrovia.
Non
occorre essere filosofi, per conoscere che, in ogni azione
naturale od
umana, il
contrasto &egrave; sempre fra una libert&agrave; e un
vincolo. Ma anche
l'equilibrio &egrave; sempre fra una libert&agrave; e un
vincolo. Di
conseguenza,
se vogliamo conciliare l'autocarro con la locomotiva,
dobbiamo raggiungere
l'equilibrio l&agrave; ove &egrave; il contrasto,
conciliando la guida
volontaria
del primo con la guida obbligata dell'altra" (quoted in
Gaetano Ciocca,
"Prove in
Roma di strada guidata," <I>Industria Italiana del
Cemento</I> 9 [October
1937]:
287).

The original reads: "Le autostrade tedesche . . .

un popolo unito e senza discordie, &egrave; in grado di
