This essay has two mottoes, and both are riddles. The point of the
first, from H&ouml;lderlin's drama <I>Empedocles,</I> is quickly felt:
"Nichts ist schmerzlicher . . . denn Leiden zu entr&auml;tseln" (Nothing
is more painful . . . than unriddling suffering).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  The second, by Lionel Trilling, reads: "To comprehend unconditioned
  spirit is not so very hard. . . ." I am thinking of how easy readers
  make it for themselves when they grasp unthinkingly the moment of
  alleged enlightenment in the Old Commandant's penal process. "But,"
  continues Trilling, "there is no knowledge rarer than the understanding
  of spirit as it exists in the inescapable conditions which the actual
  and the trivial make for it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  In writing about allotria and excreta in "In the Penal Colony," I shall
  be writing about certain nonsimple forms of the trivial (allotria) and
  the actual (excreta), two products of human activity whose ontological
  status is by no means evident.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Put the most radically serious quest for justification side by side with
 foolishness and nonsense: put the strongest, most intensely-felt life
 side by side with inattentiveness and giddy play. Allotria troubles
 the consciousness of every reader of "In the Penal Colony." There is
 a good deal of difference between how this story has come down to us,
 as a systematically pure and grave conceptual meditation on the one
 hand; and, on the other, how it actually reads. Then we will be struck
 by the emphasis on such matters as blood and vomit and sputum and muck
 and oil and the disposal system laid out to contain them; and we will
 be struck by the high jinks, horseplay, capers, antics (it turns out

<B></B>

that there are a great many words for this neglected category) imbricated
in this construction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Allotria" means what's irrelevant (<I>das
Nicht-Sachgem&auml;&szlig;e</I>), what's nonsensical
(<I>Unfug)</I>--clowning about, cutting up--exactly what the officer in
"In the Penal Colony" calls "childish nonsense" (<I>den Unsinn eines
Kindes</I>) when he is unable to convince the explorer of the value of
the penal system he represents. I quote:

It did not look as if the officer had been listening. "So you did not
find the procedure convincing," he said to himself and smiled, as an
old man smiles at childish nonsense and yet pursues his own meditations
behind the smile.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not to find the procedure convincing--a serious matter, seriously
argued--is, the officer concludes, senseless resistance. But to note this
is to smile and "pursue [one's] own meditations behind the smile." Perhaps
this is explicit instruction on how we are to read allotria in "In the
Penal Colony," read the several pages in the story dramatizing such
childish nonsense, for we are beset by them, and they are a hermeneutic
puzzle. For example:

The explorer, down below, watched the [officer's] labor uninterruptedly,
his neck grew stiff and his eyes smarted from the glare of sunshine over
the sky. The soldier and the condemned man were now busy together. The
man's shirt and trousers, which were already lying in the pit, were fished
out by the point of the soldier's bayonet. The shirt was abominably dirty,
and its owner washed it in the bucket of water. When he put on the shirt
and trousers both he and the soldier could not help guffawing, for the
garments were of course split up behind. Perhaps the condemned man felt
it incumbent on him to amuse the soldier, he turned around and around
in his slashed garments before the soldier, who squatted on the ground
beating his knees with mirth. All the same, they presently controlled
their mirth out of respect for the gentlemen. ["IPC" 162]

The soldier and the condemned man did not understand at first what was
happening, at first they were not even looking on. The condemned man
was gleeful at having got the handkerchiefs back, but he was not allowed
to enjoy them for long, since the soldier snatched them with a sudden,
unexpected grab. Now the condemned man in turn was trying to twitch them
from under the belt where the soldier had tucked them, but the soldier
was on his guard. So they were wrestling, half in jest. ["IPC" 163]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Childish nonsense," "beating his knees with mirth," "gleeful," "half in
jest," what is the meaning of such things? They occur at a moment of utter
crisis. After all, the officer is about to lay himself on the machine!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One or two things further to this "allotria"--this other Otherness, other
to allegory (<I>allos</I>: Greek for "other" [we shall see that allotria
is other to <I>pedantry</I>]): it has a past. I did not say it's named
as such in Kafka (it <I>is</I> in Thomas Mann's <I>Doctor Faustus</I>:
As a schoolboy, Adrian Leverk&uuml;hn, the serious composer, would not
be suspected of it).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

But the thing is readily enough identified in Kafka's story--as "childish
nonsense"--and the thing itself is found throughout Kafka's work: in
<I>Metamorphosis,</I> for example, it is what Gregor Samsa practices en
route to consolidating his identity as a vermin, playfully taking bits
of food in his mouth and then spitting them out, aimlessly navigating
the junk in his room. Allotria is the compulsory life content of the
vermin--as long as he is not yet being tortured to death. It is also
something that Kafka flashes out of the narrator's relation to his
composition (the semiosis), as when Gregor is shown casting a bewildered
glance upwards to the wall where the photograph hangs of Gregor Samsa,
Army lieutenant, his hand on his short sword, ready to impale his dreadful
Other. Or when Joseph K. stares wonderingly at the tourist who has come
to arrest him in a safari suit replete with pockets, pleats, buttons,
straps--the name of this captor is Franz!
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  And, most famously, now again at the level of the mimesis: the antics
  of the twin assistants in <I>The Castle.</I> It is the sort of thing
  that made Kafka's audiences laugh aloud at his readings, but they did
  not laugh when he read "In the Penal Colony" in Munich in 1916 (a woman
  is said to have fainted). "In the Penal Colony" is no laughing matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   One historical use of the term "allotria" might help to conceptualize
   it. None other than John Wesley writes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We have no right to dispose of anything we have, but according to His
will, seeing we are not proprietors of any of these things; they are all,
as our Lord speaks, <I>allotria, belonging to another person</I>; nor
is anything properly <I>our own,</I> in the land of our pilgrimage. We
shall not receive <I>ta idia, our own things,</I> till we come to our
own country.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This allotria is the nontrivial inauthentic as such, and a good deal more
significant than "time-wasting." It is lent us by God. The Wesley passage
points up the odd dual nature of the thing: it is above and also below
the civilized norm: it is divine and it is improper. More, if it is an
essential quality of Gregor Samsa and all vermin (<I>Ungeziefer</I>) then
it cannot be returned to God, as being (MHG. <I>ungeziber, unziver</I>)
"unsuited for sacrifice," unacceptable to God.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why does Kafka allow, indeed encourage, such displays of attotria? The
answer is overdetermined--at least. For him it is bound to the theater;
one crux is the story as theater. The operation of the torture machine
is <I>ein Spiel</I>--a play. "And then the performance begins" (Und nun
beginnt das Spiel), says the officer [106, "IPC" 147]); later we hear of
the parliamentary assembly, too, as a "Schaustellung," a mise-en-scene or
"public spectacle" (115, "IPC" 158).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  The events of "In the Penal Colony" comprise a theatrical play, with
  the chief spectator in a cane chair in the orchestra, the whole a kind
  of amphitheater, with palisades, as you recall from the outset. And--to
  say this directly--allotria belongs on the principle that, if this is
  a scene, then any amount of stage business is permissible. Indeed, you
  will scarcely find a longer work of Kafka's without its complement of
  stage business. This is the legacy of his highly developed instinct for
  play and performance of the demotic kind: his heroes are almost never
  artists but they are <I>artistes</I>-- trapezists, cabaret singers
  (the mouse Josephine), hunger artists--circus performers, parts of
  the theater of alternative communication: staged,

<B></B>

distantiated, fictional conveyances of feeling, everything opposite to
the immediate conversational discourse which, as Kafka said, drained
the life out of him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the death-dealing machine itself clowns in a parody of the Taylor
speedup system and the circus performance: it collapses as an extravagant
excretion of its gears, as in the circus an endless quantity of persons
are expelled from a small hidden space in a red volkswagen. Here we
verge on a crossing of allotria and excreta, allotria itself being a
sort of excrescence on the normal social essence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  But I delay discussion of this element--waste matter, dejecta--until
  after spelling out a further motive or two for Kafka's vaudeville. His
  vaudevillian practice, in principle admissible, marks his modernity
  as such--an impertinent mixing of genres and levels of communicated
  feeling, medial feeling (we may think of artistes themselves as yet
  odder types of medial communication). The point is that for all its
  impropriety and distastefulness, allotria works <I>distractingly,</I>
  and its plain function is the way it may work as relief from terror. I
  cite a sentence from <I>The Picture of Dorian Grey,</I> which may
  prove Wilde's usefulness to readings of Kafka. Dorian Grey, having
  heard a disturbing idea,

listened, open-eyed and wondering. . . . He watched it [a bee] with that
strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of
high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion
for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies
us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is another motive. In his diary entry of 9 February 1915, Kafka
complained of "In the Penal Colony." He had written the story in the late
fall of 1914 in the course of writing or failing to write <I>The Trial</I>
but had not sought to publish it, in good part because he thought he'd
botched the ending. Further evidence of this assumption is the presence in
the diary entries for August 1917 of a number of sketches of alternative
endings, none of which Kafka used. In the course of this essay, however,
I shall have recourse to refer to several of them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I said he had botched the ending of "In the Penal Colony" and to his
mind he had botched the whole of it too; on 4 September 1917, he wrote
to Kurt Wolff: "Perhaps there is some misunderstanding concerning the
'Penal Colony.' I have never been entirely wholehearted in asking for it
to be published. Two or three of the final pages are botched [<I>sind
Machwerk</I>], and their presence points to some deeper flaw; there is
a worm somewhere which hollows out the story [<I>der selbst das Volle
der Geschichte hohl macht</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we rely on Kafka's evaluation, this worm alludes to a certain "element"
which he saw--it appears--in the story he began writing in February 1915
that he calls the "dog story," which has not survived. (This is not, of
course, the splendid "Investigations of a Dog," written in 1922). This
"dog story," if this is indeed the story that Kafka is thinking of when he
continues his diary entry with the words, "Just now read the beginning,"
is "in spite of all its truth wicked, pedantic, mechanical, a fish barely
breathing on a sand bank [<I>trotz aller Wahrheit b&ouml;se, pedantisch,
mechanisch, auf einer Sandbank ein noch knapp atmender Fisch</I>]"
(11:77).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  "Mechanical," "sand bank," and "fish"

<B></B>

might be clues that he is also or, indeed, directly thinking of "In the
Penal Colony." For the words "mechanical" and "pedantic," we substitute
"allegory" and "abstraction"--this is what the scholar Ingeborg Henel
has done, as representing to excess one tendency of Kafka's art--as
opposed to the liveliness that Kafka saw in abundance in "The Stoker,"
the first chapter of his "American novel" <I>Der Verschollene</I>
(He who was never again heard from).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  It is not hard to guess what Kafka might have meant by pedantry,
  allegory, or abstraction in the case of "In the Penal Colony": it is
  the machine and the law and the scenes of political wrangling conjured
  by the officer, none of which has its foot in lived experience or which
  could be said to arise from "the translation of an idea into an image,
  pure construction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  But we are not obliged to be satisfied with his own judgment; it is much
  too cursory, and it leaves out too much of what in the story is not of
  the order of allegory but rather of allotria. Portions of this work,
  a constellation, dance on the border of conceptual knowledge: mimetic
  allotria, bodily excreta, odd signs; randomly functioning allusions;
  plays on words that have been expelled from the circle of communication
  and made thing-like; and the bag of fragmentary, unincorporated endings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Allotria is a key term, as that being beside the point, that going
off topic, that is unrecoverable as allegory. Itself an insubstantial
irrelevance, allotria both is and is attracted to elements that are
extruded and expunged from healthy, directed life--its excreta. Children
and madmen, who are drawn to excreta, whose play is so much excreta,
cannot but seem foolish--or worse--in the eyes of adults. They are at best
distractions from, at worst obstacles to, the rational conduct of life. So
it will not come as a surprise that Kafka is guilty because "on his own
admission he is depraved and takes pleasure in filth [<I>Schmutz</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  I now come to some excremental oddities in "In The Penal Colony"
  (I use the word "excremental" in its various senses of "superfluous,"
  "non-nutritive," and "of matter to be evacuated"), and am in this
  way looking askance at and away from the story's great themes of
  just sentencing, truthful writing, canonical law, torture, and
  illumination. But we will be making a return.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The excremental speaks for itself--or does it? In this story--and in
the history of its versions--the process of excretion functions as a
species of speech . . . uncannily: it is the body's mute howl of pain,
its resistance to being evacuated of its substance. It is a marker of the
body, of man's embodiedness, of the all-too-tender and recalcitrant flesh
that will not submit to discipline. It expresses itself as a protest. What
is then disgusting about such expressions, such excreta, may be their
half-living character: they are remains of the body even as they leave the
body, neither at first alive nor dead, an unwonted revelation (outside)
of the body (an inside). Hence, they are forbidden objects of curiosity
and an inducement, to the nonsqueamish, to play--allotria.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the second half of this essay, I want to fill in a quadrilateral: the
fact of allotria and excreta at the order of the mimesis; and allotria
and excreta at the order of the semiosis--I mean, the relation of the
author-<I>cum</I>-narrator to the act of composition or scription. There
is allotria in "In the Penal Colony" at the order of the composition,
at the order of the tropes, in Kafka's aberrant literalization of the
metaphor "dog." This is

<B></B>

a rhetorical play, and it connects to serious matters, belongs to an
economy involving the political. Consider the metaphor of the prisoner as
dog. We are, after all, here in the <I>Tropen,</I> the tropics--setting
for a scene of political terror--and we are also among the tropes,
<I>turns</I> of phrase. The apparent allotria of tropic play belongs to
an economy of the political administration of torture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider politics, further. Consider it as the decent (or indecent)
application of power to persons, especially as this power is produced,
stored and conveyed by institutions--viz. the "apparatus" or "machinery"
of the law in "In the Penal Colony" and the apparatus or machinery of
(the very story) "In the Penal Colony." This interinvolvement of the
two sorts of power is plain in the first paragraph, which situates
the apparatus of the torture machine and its spectators in its sandy
amphitheater. The most graphically represented of the spectators and
indeed participants is the prisoner, "a stupid-looking, wide-mouthed
[wide-muzzled (<I>breitm&auml;uliger</I>)] man with bewildered [abandoned
by authority (<I>verwahrlostem</I>)] hair and face"--an animal-like
creature, guarded ["led about" would be truer] by a soldier, "who held the
heavy chain controlling the small chains locked on the prisoner's ankles,
wrists, and neck, chains that were themselves attached to each other by
communicating links" ("IPC" 140). Having been treated like a dog (he has
even been struck on the nose by a whip), it comes as no surprise that he
has become doglike. Kafka depicts this in the striking manner that is at
once typical and still enigmatic, as we shall see. The text continues:
"In any case [additionally (<I>&uuml;brigens</I>)--there is a world of
significance in this harmless conjunctive phrase], the condemned man
looked so like a submissive dog [<I>so h&uuml;ndisch ergeben</I>] that
one might have thought he could be left to run free on the surrounding
hills and would only need to be whistled for when the execution was due
to begin" (ibid.). Doggishly submissive (<I>h&uuml;ndisch ergeben</I>)
is a metaphor. But the intensifier <I>so</I> added on to <I>h&uuml;ndisch
ergeben</I> literalizes that metaphor: the prisoner is now no different
from a dog. There are two interinvolved processes here, one political
and one rhetorical. The man is brutalized by a violent application
of political power; and the metaphor, too, is submitted to a kind of
violence in being robbed of its floating status as trope and more or
less literalized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I say "more or less" literalized, for as becomes evident after a moment's
reflection on this process, every metaphor is an unsettled semantic
force-field. This is a Kafkan awareness par excellence. To tamper with
the relation between tenor and vehicle--thing compared and comparison--is
to generate monsters (even independently of the literal meaning of the
metaphor "dog"); so even more is at stake here than that a man has been
turned into a dog. The aberrant literalizing of the metaphor suggests
that he has been turned into a monstrous collage of dog features and man
features outside of any ordinary scale of things--neither man nor dog,
he is rendered more brutal than a man, more monstrous than a dog.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This literalizing moment was a crucial one for Kafka in the story. He
hated, as I said, the ending of "In the Penal Colony"; and unlike the case
of "The Metamorphosis," whose ending he also hated, he left behind several
fragmentary versions of possible alternatives in his diaries. These are
extraordinarily lurid. One reads:

The explorer felt too tired to give [any further] commands or [indeed]
to do anything. He merely took a handkerchief from his pocket, gestured
as if he were dipping it in the distant bucket, pressed it to his brow
and lay down beside the pit [this emphasizes the excrement-containing
pit and bucket]. He was found in this position by the two men the
Commandant had sent out to fetch him. He jumped up when they spoke
to him as if revived. With his hand on his heart he said, "I am a cur
[<I>Hundsfott</I>] if I allow that to happen." But then he took his own
words literally [<I>w&ouml;rtlich</I>] and began to run around on all
fours. From time to time, however, he leaped erect, shook the fit off,
so to speak [<I>ri&szlig; sich f&ouml;rmlich los</I>], threw his arms

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This diary entry dates from 7 August 1917; he had written "In the
Penal Colony" three years earlier, ca. 15 October 1914. Notice the
administration of political authority and also the mad, foolish play
with rative language (allotria of the signifier). This play returns,
too, to the first paragraph of the story but here, as an unincorporated
fragment, remains excreted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I want to dwell on this relation of the play with rhetoric and the
seriousness of the political administration of terror. In these examples
from the beginning and end of the story, the will and the ability to
tamper with the metaphor goes to the artist, who obtains thereby an
extraordinary rhetorical power not without marginal political power
(since this metaphorical labeling lends itself to political use). This
monstrous literalization is the rhetorical equivalent of the political,
where the political--in this our painful modernity--has come to mean the
construction of types of men and women by the application of force and
the constructive destruction of men and women as persons as good as dead:
vermin, outlaws, rogues.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I do not claim that Kafka <I>says</I> that the political and the
rhetorical are involved in one another, duplicate one another, or cause
one another. Yet he does show this complication happening. Thus I claim,
simply, that it takes place. The word-play that has a great deal to do
with torture-play is not merely marginal to the text and its time. But
the effort to say what this connection is in truth--whether, as Cultural
Studies has it, the political play contains and comprehends the rhetorical
play; or whether the rhetorical play, marginally outside politics, in turn
provokes political acts and a subtle knowing representation of political
acts (J. M. Coetzee writes of "the freedom of textuality, however meager
and marginal that freedom may be")--Kafka's story cannot <I>say</I> this.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Addressing this rhetorical dimension of the story entails addressing
one sort of play, one form of the marginal, that has the power to usurp
center stage. We must now look at the disgusting, and then at three
textual cruxes triggered once more by rhetorical details. All bear on
the process of <I>reading</I> a work interrupted by allotria and excreta.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"'Read it,' said the officer. 'I can't,' said the explorer" ("IPC"
148). There is no information on how the victim's reading process is to
take place; it requires a strenuous and ultimately frustrating effort
of interpretation on our part. The writing is of two

<B></B>

types--the first is called "the actual [real] script(ure) [<I>die
wirkliche Schrift</I>]" and "the [authentic] script(ure) itself
[<I>die eigentliche Schrift</I>]"; the second type of writing is
ornamental, consisting of "embellishments [<I>Verzierungen</I>]" (107;
"IPC" 149). One might be inclined to call the second type inauthentic,
secondary, derivative, employing the semiotic model of the metaphor. The
real, authentic meaning is borne along, as the tenor, by the trope--the
metaphor as such--which then might pass away, its semantic work as vehicle
having been done. But this cannot be right; this is not the function
of the embellishment, since reading the ornament is <I>essential</I> to
the work of justice, to "the kind of sentence we pass [the form of our
judgment--<I>die Form unseres Urteils</I>]" (103, "IPC" 144). The form
is not complete, the essence of the punishment does not happen until the
ornament, too, has been deciphered. Nor is there any suggestion that the
embellishments, rightly deciphered, amount to getting the message--the
sentence as violated commandment is different from its embellishments--but
not essentially different.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  In the <I>Tropen,</I> in the tropics, all are tropes (<I>Tropen</I>):
  the designation of the real, the authentic sentence, is already gnawed
  on by this secondary and derivative function; and so we are inclined
  to ask, Of what are they the res, the fictive (after all not real
  or authentic) script? But we are unable to say more than that they are
  essential. This is artistic (<I>kunstvoll</I>), beautiful but nonsimply
  beautiful handwriting, "no calligraphy [<I>keine Sch&ouml;nschrift</I>]
  for schoolchildren" (107, "IPC" 149). He clearly signifies something
  within what the officer calls "<I>das Gesamturteil</I> [the general
  or broad-gauged judgment]" (109, "IPC" 151), but what?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   Perhaps it signifies, in the sense of mirroring--or completing a
   structural parallel with--the function of the ostensibly trivial
   (allotria) and excremental in the story as such--the curlicues
   and embellishments being equivalent to the plethora of "useless"
   details. They are marginal and excremental, suspending any possible
   assertion of the precedence, as essential, of issues of justice over
   the other issues of art and aesthetics. Here we are returned to the
   historical dispute among modes of criticism and modes of literary
   classification, within Kafka studies, in respect to "In the Penal
   Colony." Is it, as a story of a punishment that raises substantial
   questions of law and justice and just sentencing, to be classified with
   those other stories of Kafka (as Kafka explicitly intended), with "The
   Metamorphosis" and "The Judgment"; or should it be classified with,
   par excellence, "A Hunger Artist," as a story of art and performance
   for which no audience any longer exists?
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  "Nor did the colony itself betray much interest in this execution": this
  citation immediately resonates with the opening of "A Hunger Artist"
  (100, "IPC" 140). But these are structural formalities. The matter of
  the embellishment poses the crucial question: if the epistemological
  status, as we say, of the ornamental script(ure) is undecidable, if the
  relation of trope to diegesis is unfathomable, what then is the status
  of the understanding that is given to the prisoner's faculty of reason
  (<I>der Verstand</I>) in the sixth hour?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This question has hardly ever seemed to be stated as a problem before. In
the sixth hour the culprit grasps his sentence--so runs the conventional
understanding--but does he? Surely not. First, because the process
requires a <I>twelve-hour</I> deciphering; second, because what Kafka
(unlike his English translator) has written is, the process

<B></B>

requires a twelve-hour "<I>deciphering</I> [<I>Entziffern</I>]"
. This phrase immediately calls attention to the signifier
(<I>Ziffer</I>), but you would not think so, reading the Muirs's
translation of "<I>es geschieht ja nichts weiter, der Mann f&auml;ngt
blo&szlig; an, die Schrift zu entziffern</I>" as, "Nothing more happens
than that the man begins to understand the inscription [the script(ure)]"
("IPC" 150). What is wrong is a tendency that this translation betrays;
this "to understand" recalls the rational enlightenment provoked in the
sixth hour, when enlightenment comes to the most dull-witted (<I>Verstand
geht dem Bl&ouml;desten auf</I>), encouraging us to conclude that the
event of understanding coming alive is equivalent to the truth of an
ethical commandment being grasped by reason (ibid.). And that truth
is? Whatever it is, it is <I>not</I> the truth of the verdict. One
<I>must</I> consult the German! <I>The moment of ecstasy is not that of
understanding the script(ure); it is a moment of recognizing that here
there is script to be deciphered.</I> "Script(ure) [<I>Die Schrift</I>],"
as the Prison Chaplain in <I>The Trial</I> informs Joseph K., this writing
made deep, "is unchanging, invariant [<I>ist unver&auml;nderlich</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  We deal then not with combustion of the script (&agrave; la Walter
  Benjamin) but with the ineradicability of a fact: here there is writing;
  here is the task of the translator. But if the prisoner deciphers the
  script with his wounds, and if at the end of things the prisoner is
  (virtually) nothing more than his wounds, then perfection of justice
  consists in the wounds deciphering the wounds or, equivalently,
  the script deciphering the script, leaving no margin free for
  rational enlightenment or any other manner of interpretation. "How
  the inscription takes form on the body [<I>wie sich die Inschrift im
  K&ouml;rper vollzieht</I>]" is by no means equivalent to the "happening
  of justice" (<I>da&szlig; Gerechtigkeit</I> [<I>geschieht</I>])," if
  by the latter is meant the prisoner's understanding of his sentence
  (106, 111). He cannot understand his sentence until he is emptied out
  of his substance, until he has been <I>excreted.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this analysis I am associating the concepts of understanding and
interpretation as they have traditionally been associated in a German
hermeneutical tradition marked especially by Friedrich Schlegel and
Friedrich Schleiermacher. The concept of "decoding," however, with its
connotations of automaticity and of transformation only, or chiefly,
along the axis of the material signifier constitutes a departure. Here,
one could well think of Kafka's aphorism against interpretation, written
in 1922: "It is enough that the arrows fit exactly in the wounds that
they have made" (<I>D</I> 206; <I>G</I> 11:203).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We as readers of Kafka remain concerned with our access to an
understanding of what genuinely, authentically, occurs within the
<I>Gesamturteil</I> of the story as a whole. It is the question of
whether it is possible for us to achieve any proper understanding of the
prisoner's tormented reading process as such. And here I want to call
attention to two minor, marginal, rather excremental cruxes at the order
of scription--one parenthesis and one (following the authority of Max
Brod) crossing-out. Excreted matter has an exact semiotic correlative
in the parenthesis: it is excluded from the sentence while it still
belongs to the economy of the sentence the way that excreta--noticed,
half-organic, half-alive stuff--belongs to the economy of the
body. The parenthesis is unique as a syntactical element in requiring
no corresponding adjustment in the sentence as a whole in order to
accommodate it, just as there is a provision in every body for excreted
matter that does not disturb the economy of the whole and permits it to
function as it normally and otherwise functions.

<B></B>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The parenthesis occurs at the close of the mutilation of the officer. The
passage reads, as we carry over Kafka's <I>parenthesis</I> from the
edition (and only the edition) of Paul Raabe: "And here, almost against
his will, he had to look at the face of the corpse. It was as it had
been in life; no sign was visible of the promised redemption; what the
others had found in the machine the officer had not found; the lips were
firmly pressed together, the eyes were open, with the same expression
as in life, the look was calm and convinced, through the forehead went
the point of the great iron spike." [121, "IPC" 166] Thereafter come
the three asterisks and the unsatisfactory ending.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Who says--and on what authority--that the officer found no trace of
the promised redemption? The officer remains convinced; he has not
registered the shortfall in the promised redemption. But he is the
only authority we have for the existence of any such redemption. I
suggest that the uncertainty of the claim that "no sign was visible
of the promised redemption" in the death of the officer is marked,
emphasized by the parenthesis. Within it is contained the (incomplete)
excremental at the order of rhetoric. This is an odd detail of a sort
found to my knowledge in no other work of Kafka--a "detail" of utter
importance. It is a paradoxical construction, implying, to begin with, a
sort of tentativeness of utterance. For what is the meaning of the marker
"parenthesis" except that of an addition, an "<I>&uuml;brigens,</I>"
a remainder, an only secondary reflection, whose retention in the body
of an argument is a matter that cannot be allowed to disturb the writer,
who has more serious, forward-looking concerns? The argument, as it is
constituted without the parenthesis, takes precedence: the writer will
not undertake to integrate the parenthetical matter; and yet, in this
instance, regarding the question of whether the officer found meaning
in his ordeal--No, not a trace of it was to be found!--is of crucial
importance. It is the story's leading idea. How can one find the story's
leading idea between parentheses?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is as if what's contained in the parenthesis, a bracketing off--meaning
non-pertinence, what's off the point, scarcely belonging--were itself
provisory only, subject to revision, even to reversal. And yet--or,
precisely--what is here at stake is nothing less than the meaning of
the whole. Was there ever in truth such a procedure as the glorious
operation of the machine? was there ever so worthy an alternative to the
inefficient justice of liberal states? could a death ever be justified
in the consciousness of the victim in this way? could the truth of one's
derelict life ever be inscribed on the heart?
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  And could, incidentally, Nietzsche's account of the genealogy of morals
  be affirmed--was there ever a moment of dawning moral enlightenment
  powerful enough to irradiate and transre an entire people? Sane
  societies require a token of hope, the promise of a future. Accordingly,
  the punishment in the penal colony is such a token, because it promises
  a transration of an entire community before death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These are some of the questions taken up in a parenthesis in "In the Penal
Colony" as published--overwhelming questions to which Kafka's answers are
belied by his parenthesis--questions reviewed and answered differently
in the three or four fragmentary endings. I shall therefore address one
more pertinent item from these diary manuscripts in the event of a moot
crossing-out. The text of these endings in the latest Fischer, so-called
manuscript edition, a printed transcription by and large faithful to

<B></B>

the manuscripts, gives as the diary entry for 8 August 1917: "Und
wenn auch alles unver&auml;ndert war, der Stachel war doch da, krumm
hervorragend aus der geborstenen Stirn" (<I>G</I> 11:353). In (my)
English, this reads: "And even if everything was unchanged, the spike was
still there, protruding crookedly from his shattered forehead." But if you
read the standard English translation of the diaries, you get instead:
"And even if everything remained unchanged, the spike was still there,
crookedly protruding from his shattered forehead <I>as if it bore witness
to some truth</I>" (<I>D</I> 178; emphasis added). The addition of this
last phrase is explained in a footnote of Max Brod, Kafka's editor
and literary executor: "The clause, 'as if it bore witness to some
truth,' was struck out by Kafka in the manuscript" (<I>D</I> 322). So
this footnotation "as if it bore witness to some truth," having, then,
precisely parenthetical status, returns to a <I>crossing out</I> (leaving
in the empirical state of affairs of the transmission of the manuscript
the perplexing uncertainty about whether Kafka's intention in having
crossed out the phrase "as if [his shattered forehead] bore witness to
some truth" is to be respected). If respected, the sum of things is left
intact and pure and <I>no</I> trace of the promised redemption was indeed
to be seen. But it is equally compelling to preserve this velleity (it is
<I>not</I> preserved in the manuscript edition)--to find in the officer's
report the positive substance of justice--for it would convey a most
important indecision and nostalgia and intense imaginative yearning in
Kafka, he who had written (while still young) of his desire to write his
being into the depths of the paper and to draw up that writing into him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The words "as if it bore witness to some truth" are remarkable ones to
cross out. Kafka's own reading confirms the reader's suspicions. This
is not a story about true sentencing but about its disappearance,
its traceable disappearance in the intricacies and hollow places of
fiction. Throughout, the narration of (principally) the reception--on
the part of the Explorer--of the narration produced by a fanatic of
a ceremony who can no more than imply that a prisoner's (attempt at)
deciphering the truth of his sentence is achieved with his death. The
truth of this procedure is then nullified when it is empirically enacted
by the same fanatic on himself. But what we have lost as an "acquist
of true experience," we have gained as a tolerable experience of the
trivial of allotria and the excremental.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  What is tasteless in the actual and trivial is etiolated, bled of its
  loathsome horror, by this multiplication of narrative foci and foyers--a
  gesture which, by driving truth out of art, enlarges its scope. In
  this work the tastelessness of trifling allotria and the excremental
  (a kind of expressiveness) are symbols together of the distasteful that
  now has a place in art and can be borne. Its "meaning" is reflexive
  only. It points to the vast, unlimited--because truth-bled--order of
  the signifier in art. This is a conclusion perfectly consistent with
  Hegel's view of the end of art as the end of an art that would need
  to be validated by the truth it can now no longer represent.
