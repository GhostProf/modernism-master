<p>I like wine. Air raids much less.</p>
<div class="attrib">—Virginia Woolf<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter that scholars provisionally date to March 18, 1941, Virginia Woolf explained to her husband Leonard why she was "going mad again." "I begin to hear voices, and cant concentrate," Woolf records: "You see I cant even write this properly. I cant read. What I want to say is that I owe all the happiness of my life to you."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In the intervening days before she took her life on March 28, Woolf sent a copy of her last novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> , to John Lehmann, managing director of Hogarth Press. Despite his enthusiastic praise for the text, Woolf wrote Lehmann on March 27 to declare that she would continue to revise the novel,<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> which she had earlier called "a concentration—a screw" amidst the "many air raids" of World War II and a "concentrated small book" that contained "many varieties of mood" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 311, 114). The next day, Woolf wrote Leonard a note similar to her letter of March 18—omitting the sentence about her inability to "concentrate"—and drowned herself hours later in the River Ouse.</p>
<p>A writer who believed that "to shut out, to concentrate—that is perhaps—one of the necessary conditions [. . .] of genius," <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Woolf knew that retaining her concentration was also, by the time she omitted it from her final letter to Leonard, a necessary condition of survival (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 179). World War II escalated the struggle that Woolf had endured throughout her life to retain such focus: numbered 115 and 116 on Hitler's secret arrest list for England, the Woolfs both planned to kill themselves should Hitler invade England, which seemed increasingly plausible during the Blitz (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 165). Contemplating the alternatives of "we in concentration camps, or taking sleeping draughts," Woolf avowed her intention to do the latter or gas herself in her garage rather than submit to Hitler, for "capitulation will mean all Jews to be given up. Concentration camps. So to our garage" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 292-3). The Nazi concentration camps presented Woolf with two fatal options—taking her own life or having it taken from her—that would eliminate the possibility of concentration altogether.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At the expense of finishing what she otherwise considered to be a "triumphant" novel, however, Woolf did retain through her final days "a concentration" in the "concentrated [. . .] variety of moods" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, a book that critiques the Nazi regime and that provided Woolf focus during the Blitz (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 340). As her use of the word to describe both her personal attention and her novel's aesthetic suggests, concentration was, for Woolf, not only a state of mind in this period but a medium of aesthetic, ethical, and political agency. Her March 18 letter to Leonard establishes such links as it correlates Woolf's personal facility to "concentrate" with her aesthetic abilities to "write" and "read." The goal of this correlation, she says, is to express her belief in and gratitude for intersubjective bonds: "I owe all the happiness of my life to you."</p>
<p>Woolf's concentration thus highlights a central aesthetic and ethical paradigm in her late work, namely the need to overcome the boundaries of the self in order to sympathize with a world of others, what Natania Rosenfeld calls Woolf's "politics of intersubjectivity."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> While her association of the phrases "to concentrate" and "to shut out" might appear to imply just the opposite, Woolf actually concentrates by shutting out the self, specifically the self's socially-constructed identity. Woolf's concentration is as she says "a screw," a binding agent between subject and object made acutely necessary by the war, during which she wrote that "now's the time to see if the art, or life, creed, the belief in something existing independently of myself, will [. . .] hold good" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 264). As a transitive verb, "concentrate" requires such selective focus on others: it denotes the fixation of personal faculties on an object, and it can mean bringing a group of objects together.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> For Woolf, these definitions work simultaneously, for she posits in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> that one must divest oneself of self-identity—threatening but never achieving biological death—in order to create a collectivity that might survive, and in fact prevent, the self-obsessed sources and goals of warfare.</p>
<p>As the force required to screw objects together suggests, however, this ethic troublingly posits that instances of violence by and to the ego yield communal cohesion. Especially in her late work, as Patricia Klindienst Joplin argues, Woolf explores "whether it is possible to constitute an identity, whether as an individual or group, except at the expense of an other."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In her memoir "A Sketch of the Past" , for example, Woolf records how the Blitz reinforced her belief that "nothing is so much to be dreaded as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  egotism. Nothing so cruelly hurts the person himself; nothing so wounds those who are forced into contact with it."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Yet such violence, she had claimed of World War I, can also yield a "whole people [. . .] concentrated on a single point" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 1: 217), a concentration that Woolf calls during WWII "the community feeling: all England thinking this same thing—this horror of war—at the same moment." Horror like war is prerequisite for collective concentration, she writes, lest come "the lull &amp; one lapses again into private separation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 215).</p>
<p>While scholars have examined the politics of community in Woolf's late work—most persuasively as a critique of modernist preoccupations with interiority—they have largely overlooked how Woolf's ethic of self-divestiture hinges on this principle of violence.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Yet this ethic inheres in another denotation of "concentrate": to strengthen through distillation, even purification.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Formally and thematically, Woolf's vision of concentration in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> enacts such violent purification on the model of atavism, or the reversion of biological forms to prior stages of development, an idea popularized in the modernist period by Charles Darwin, whose work Woolf read and wanted to write about during WWII (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 274, 294, 331). Darwin based his theory of descent partially on the evidence of atavistic traits in humans, which he terms "reversions" and "rudiments," the former concept referring to biological structures that reappear during a species' development, the latter referring to obsolete structures that nonetheless endure.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Together, Darwin writes, "reversionary, as well as the strictly rudimentary, structures reveal the descent of man from some lower form in an unmistakeable manner" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 130). In his documentation of "reversions to a savage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 173), Darwin offered one of the most famous violations of anthropocentrism in modern thought. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, Woolf extends this violation to a civilization whose efforts at domination betray, and threaten to destroy, its members' collective "lower form."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Thematically, Woolf creates a concentrated community in this novel by stripping individuals of the pretensions to civilization that constitute individual and national identities alike. Such pretensions structure the novel's premise about a small English village community that gathers in the summer of 1939 at a country estate named Pointz Hall to witness and participate in an annual pageant play meant to celebrate English literary and political history. Woolf stages that play outdoors, however, in a natural setting that vexes the play and causes the audience to realize, as one anonymous character says, "'there's a sense in which we all, I admit, are savages still.'"<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> By atavistically despoiling her characters' individual identities, Woolf concentrates them into an unidentified "we."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> As an anonymous portion of the audience muses, "'It's a good day, some say, the day we are stripped naked. Others, it's the end of the day'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 106). "Living near to the bone" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 328), as Woolf described life during the war, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s characters have no choice about whether to regress: only about whether their submission to that reversion will constitute their civilization's renewal or its death.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Formally, Woolf enacts this distillation through the novel's direct discourse and objective third-person reportage. Both formal traits detach the narrator (when one appears) and the reader from characters' private lives. This narratological detachment, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or stripping away of mediation, explains Woolf's preoccupation with the drama in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, for the novel form is distinguished by narratological mediation, whereas drama typically forgoes mediation and relates character through dialogue and action. Stripping her novel of a mediating "I" (or any consistent narratological voice), Woolf presents a community in the process of self-divestiture. Such techniques led Woolf to claim that she had "got at a more direct method of summarising relations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 200) and found "a new combination of the raw &amp; the lyrical" while writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 259). Through such aesthetic concentration, the novel formalizes its atavistic thematics.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Disturbing even on their own terms, Woolf's aesthetic and ethic of concentration run troublingly close to the eugenic logic practiced in the Nazi concentration camps, which Hitler's regime used in a genocidal campaign initiated before and escalated after Woolf's death.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The Nazis murdered homosexuals, Jews, and other social minorities in an effort to purify the race of degeneracy, a term that arose with evolutionary theory to denote biological forms that were atavistic and/or enervated.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> adumbrates this genocide, as characters read about murders and imprisonment on the continent, discuss Jewish refugees, and fear invasion as they watch threatening planes fly overhead during the pageant (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 32; 84; 131; 135). Depicting her characters in a universal state of degeneration—"all savages"—but proposing that such degeneration is salvific, Woolf parodies eugenic forms of concentration that endorse material destruction, even as she supports a form of concentration that propagates material difference by distilling social identity. With such parody, as the epigraph above suggests, Woolf employs a relentlessly humorous tone throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> that engenders the "variety of moods" that she claimed her "concentrated small book" contained.</p>
<p>A paragraph from the early typescript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> exemplifies this strange concatenation of humor and horror in Woolf's principle of concentration:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>To some, a snatch of poetry, if it were only the rhyme on a tear-off calendar, was as necessary a part of the toilet as any other; they read as they brushed their teeth. But the concentration necessary was unhygienic; they could no more read poetry by the hour—unless stretched in a sand pit or under a tree with a pine needle for marker, dipping and ceasing, dipping and ceasing—than they could do dumbbell exercises or pray. It was a concentration, a pressure upon the mind—poetry—that turned it to diamond. And how could a pressure like that be maintained without injury to the delicate fibres?</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 50)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Framed within a laughable scene of British gentry reading poetry while brushing their teeth, Woolf's description of concentration, with its parodic attention to hygiene, subverts the Nazis' eugenic logic of purification. For Woolf, concentration upon aesthetic matters is "unhygienic" by normative standards: it requires "dipping and ceasing" into atavistic poses "in a sand pit or under a tree"; it demands a focus that exceeds the boundaries of self-care and must incur "injury to the delicate fibres." Yet such violence to civilized identity may be constructive, Woolf implies, for this "pressure upon the mind" transforms the mind into "diamond." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Although she omits this scene from the novel's final—but for her only provisional—iteration, Woolf uses this simultaneously humorous and disturbing logic of concentration throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> to undermine the egotistical self bent on dominating others with its own sense of identity. Epitomizing one of the novel's refrains, "the laughter died away," <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> is riddled with affectively incongruous episodes: reflections on rape inspiring reflections on the weather, a tale of suicide followed by an adult's defending her own immaturity, murder in the name of "a child's game," and a woman (indeed a whole community) who looks "nearly extinct" as she "clapped and laughed loud" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 40, 42, 45, 16, 31, 68, 65). Such episodes themselves riddle the text's long pageant play, a pastiche of English comedies that fails so miserably that its author repeatedly likens it to death (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96, 122).</p>
<p>Scholars have long debated about whether such scenes position <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> within the comedic or the tragic mode, yet I argue that Woolf's aesthetic of concentration distills the tragedy of civilization into a comedy of nature.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Woolf pits the historically subordinate, feminized mode of comedy against the traditionally dominant, masculinized mode of tragedy to create a formal allegory for the novel's feminist politics: as Woolf herself claimed, "when tragedy and comedy collide it is comedy that wins."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Whereas tragedy classically offers a "change of fortune [that] should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Woolf's comedy of nature employs the tragic structure of decline as a good: as a submission and return to a Darwinian understanding of nature as infinitely heterogeneous and transformative, one wherein "species are not immutable" but exist in "infinitely varied diversities."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Distilled to this state of material mutability, <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span> might renounce its civilized claim to a static identity and submit to the remarkably "protean and polymorphic" quality that, Darwin believes, characterizes the human species (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 249).<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> For Woolf, the transformative possibilities inherent in the atavistic human seem promising in an era tragically committed to ideological stasis.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>When Woolf's character Isa requests a "new plot" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, then, a "plot [that] was only there to beget emotion," Woolf provides one in the form of what Dana Seitler terms the modernist "degeneration narrative," which, "rather than resulting in the closure of the conventional heterosexual love plot or adventure novel, results in the regression of an individual to an atavistic state," such that its plot "regresses as it progresses."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Refusing a heterosexual telos, Woolf's degenerative comedy presents a complementary mode to what Michael North calls the 20<sup>th</sup>-century's "machine-age comedy," a historically unprecedented form inspired by that century's innovations in mechanical reproduction, for the post-Darwinian comedy of nature produces difference through a variety of reproductive and non-reproductive means.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> On the evidence of productive forces like the "spontaneous variations of instincts," in fact, Darwin argues that it is "certainly an error" to suppose "that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction" (<span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 245, 32). Whereas the machine's comedy emerges from a confusion between the mechanical and the natural, nature's comedy emerges from their disarticulation: from the disarticulation of any identification, in fact, wherein production could be mistaken for reproduction alone.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, Woolf represents such potentially non-reproductive diversities in a queer social world that arguably realizes the "anonymous and secret Society of Outsiders" that, she envisions in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> , might t fascism pacifically by rejecting nationalist motivations.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The "many variety of moods" that permeate <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s queer world may accordingly be synthesized as <span style="font-style:italic;">camp</span>, an aesthetic whose resistance to definition itself exemplifies the novel's affective indeterminacy.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> In her 1964 essay "Notes on 'Camp,'" nonetheless, Susan Sontag provides some consistent traits of the aesthetic that bear relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>: that camp "is alive to a double sense in which some things can be taken"; that camp "corrupts" and "appreciates vulgarity"; and that "camp and tragedy are antitheses," for camp "proposes a comic vision of the world" and evinces "love for human nature."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Reinforcing Jed Esty's insight that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> "represents a group's wish to avoid collective identity as a positive feature <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> its collective identity," the novel's camp aesthetic corrupts individual and national identities to propose a communal ethic of "human sympathy," of "love for human nature."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In contemporary theoretical accounts of queer experience, however, feelings like camp are characteristically set in opposition to scientific understandings of nature, as is queerness generally. Writes Sontag, "camp objects, and persons, contain a large element of artifice. Nothing in nature can be campy" ("Notes," 55). Upsetting such critical orthodoxies, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> depicts queer feelings like camp as natural on the Darwinian logic that nature itself is queer, or endlessly transformative and defiant of material or conceptual normativity.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In contrast to the green nail polish and mangy fur coat that adorn this period's most famously campy character, Christopher Isherwood's Sally Bowles, the novel offers a distilled version of camp that, with its emphasis on forms of concentration, including biological and cultural atavism, might be called <span style="font-style:italic;">concentrated camp</span>.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> This term encapsulates how Woolf enacts in form precisely the ethic that she propounds in content: she strips an aesthetic typically laden with civilized trappings to its bare material core—the unidentified, feeling body—just as she proposes that European civilization degenerate to a social mode of material interconnection before the artifice of identity takes on such force that it eradicates materiality altogether.</p>
<p>As Steve Lipman and Viktor Frankl record, a related form of humor pervaded the atavistic conditions of the concentration camps themselves, where prisoners "found humor, sometimes sardonic humor, in all aspects of their disrupted existence" as a way to "embrac[e] the wider cycles of life and death" and to reject "false illusions" and "artificial optimism."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Woolf similarly disparaged wartime's artificial feelings: she mourned that "most people are numb &amp; have surface optimism" derived from "the emotional falsity" of "that dreary false cheery hero-making strain" that emerged in German and British war propaganda (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 231, 292). For Woolf, such propaganda sanitized war's horror under the patronizing, and paternalistic, guise of heroism: "I dont like any of the feelings war breeds: patriotism; communal &amp;c, all sentimental &amp; emotional parodies of our real feelings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 302). With her camp aesthetic, Woolf parodies these "emotional parodies" themselves to foil the horror that Nazi propaganda rationalized under the name of health and British propaganda under the name of heroism. Such parodies might, she hoped, shock the wartime community out of its <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  numb optimism and transform Hitler's oppressive concept of "nature as guarantor of unchanging order" on the Darwinian logic that nature is the guarantor of a changing order.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> If camp "refashion[s] as a weapon of attack an oppressive identity inherited <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> subordination," Woolf's concentrated camp refashions nature as guarantor of the chance that queer lives might proliferate beyond eugenic concentration.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>

<p>Laughter is an indispensible tool in deconstructions of the bio-politics of being female.</p>

<div class="attrib">—Donna Haraway, <span style="font-style:italic;">Primate Visions: Gender,</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science</span><sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>As detailed in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, Woolf characteristically described war in gendered terms, viewing fascism as a product of European patriarchy.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> As we will see, Woolf also characteristically described humor as women's best weapon against such forces. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s obscene camp, she expands this feminist politic to the realm of queer aesthetics. In the October 1938 letter in which she announces her first work on the novel, in fact, Woolf claims that she is "going to write a comedy about" the idea "that marriage [. . .] reduces one to a damnable servility."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> By making such reduction humorous, Woolf aims, as Christine Froula argues, "to form a radical public to whom women artists, like Joyce and Proust, can 'say everything,'" including, as Rebecca Walkowitz aptly puts it, that "one must risk being bad—uncertain, inconsistent, unsuccessful—in order to keep being good."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Woolf's attempt to be good with bad aesthetics—a definition of camp itself—is cause to reassess what some have deemed her pacifism and passivity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> As Pamela Robertson argues in her unprecedented analysis of female camp, "camp offers a slightly different model of negotiation to account for the overlap between passivity and activity in a viewer who sees through, simultaneously perhaps, one mask of serious femininity and another mask of laughing femininity."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In a position of active passivity, Woolf's characters present a frighteningly comedic response to war: submitting to degradation, not just to martial violence but to natural violence, including the queerly sadomasochistic pleasures of sex. Such sexual submission, Leo Bersani writes, offers "the terrifying appeal of a loss of the ego, of a self-debasement" that, by shattering the ego's "sacrosanct value of selfhood," may also prevent "sexuality [from] becoming a struggle for power."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, this degradation emerges through evolutionary tropes of atavism that derive from Darwin's theories of natural selection and variation in, among other texts, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origin of Species</span> (1859; 1872), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</span> , and the first volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span> . Woolf offers these atavistic tropes in earnest; the parodic element <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of her evolutionary art derives from Darwin's misogynist renderings of sexual selection in the second volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>. Claims like the following, for example, have long made the idea of a Darwinian feminism seem like a contradiction in terms:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Man is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage state he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the male of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should gain the power of selection. Women are everywhere conscious of the value of their beauty; and when they have the means, they take more delight in decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments than do men.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 371-2)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Whereas most of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>'s second volume details how sexual selection works on the logic that females are attracted to their more beautiful male counterparts (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 78), Darwin reserves this reductive characterization of beauty-conscious females for the human species, perhaps under the pressure of Victorian gender standards. Regardless of his motivations, Darwin makes beauty, rather than any other aesthetic state, the paradigm of sexual reproduction amongst all species, and he depicts all females in the thrall of males, whether to their beauty or their power. For <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span>, Darwin's alarming conclusion from these explorations is that "man has ultimately become superior to woman" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 328)—a conclusion upon which Hitler seizes in his eugenic practices.</p>
<p>In his rhetoric against degeneration, which Woolf followed assiduously on the BBC and in newspapers (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 5: 245, 263), Hitler declares war against the unsanitized and degenerate on the Darwinian logic that, as he writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span> (1925-6), "every historical event in the world is nothing more nor less than a manifestation of the instinct of racial self-preservation."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Within the eugenic programs that he endorsed to eliminate degeneracy, programs including forced sterilization and state-run marriages, Hitler aimed to prevent women from working and to subjugate them into maternal roles, for every girl, he averred, "is one day to be a mother" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 376). Coupled with his attempt to eliminate homosexuals, whom he considered as "infectious and as dangerous as the plague," Hitler's campaign against non-reproductive women attempted to institutionalize reproductivity as the only natural state of sexual being.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>True to his pseudo-Darwinian rhetoric, Hitler calls upon "Nature" to justify his eugenic programs, citing it as a model of "selective breeding" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 39). While Darwin does flirt with eugenic ideals at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>'s second volume, he more consistently holds that nature is not a selective breeder but a random collection of "dimly understood laws of variation [that] are infinitely complex and diversified" and whose "number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 403; <span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 34). Natural selection cannot work in states of homogeneity, Darwin writes, for "the possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability," such that "close interbreeding, by lessening [species'] vigour and fertility, aids in their final extinction."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Deploying Darwin's invariant theory of sexual selection to the point of obfuscating his theories of natural selection and variability, Hitler perverts evolutionary theory to legislate its laws, especially the laws of sexual nature, despite his claim that "man must not ever fall into the error of thinking that he was ever meant to be the lord and master of Nature."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Owing in part to such deployments of Darwin's science of gender, Woolf was generally suspicious of science, and she particularly distrusted her doctors, many of whom were active in the eugenics field.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Nonetheless, she read more sexological work in the last three years of her life than any period theretofore, including not just Darwin but "Victorian psychology" that denigrated women (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 132).<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> In portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, Woolf earnestly condemns this field's doctrine about women's "bondage" to men, to a cult of beauty, and to the preservation of hygiene. The character Mrs. Swithin, for example, reads throughout the novel a book titled "Outline of History," a fictionalized version of George Trevelyan's <span style="font-style:italic;">History of England</span> , a text premised on Darwinian principles. Such reading leads Swithin to wonder "'Who makes sex susceptible to beauty?'" and then skeptically to liken beauty to a boat that "sometimes leaks" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 139). Isa, moreover, considers reading Darwin—specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent of Man</span> in the early typescript—but instead reads a newspaper story about a woman raped by British soldiers (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 14; <span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 54).</p>
<p>Woolf's direct transition here from misogynist text to misogynist act clearly indicts Darwin. Rather than disregarding his theories altogether, however, Woolf proposes that women must redefine nature as infinitely mutable, Darwin's most consistent theorization of the concept. She records this ambition in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, writing that "Nature it was claimed who is not only omniscient but unchanging, had made the brain of woman of the wrong shape or size [. . .] Science, it would seem, is not sexless; she is a man" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 39). Like Elizabeth Grosz, who has recently demonstrated Darwin's urgent relevance to contemporary feminist theory, Woolf does not repudiate nature altogether on the basis of such constructions but asks instead, "Must we not, and do we not change this unalterable nature?"<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, during the composition of which she claimed to "want to take naturalists notes—human naturalists notes," Woolf changes science's misogynist nature by parodying it: she depicts all of humanity under the weight of Darwin's oppressive principle of feminine submission, stripping life of constructed difference to return it to Darwin's infinitely variegated state of nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 339). Woolf camps sexual selection, in other words, to concentrate natural selection and variation.</p>
<p>With this parody, Woolf also attacks Hitler's deployment of Darwin's theory of sexual selection in his rhetoric of <span style="font-style:italic;">völkisch</span> hierarchy and submission to the Führer. Resonant of Hitler's demand that the masses adhere to "the aristocratic principle of Nature" and "like a woman [. . .] rather bow to the strong man than dominate the weakling," Woolf forces <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s female protagonists (indeed, all of its human characters) to submit to the domination of a post-Darwinian nature: as Isa muses, "'How I am burdened with what they drew from the earth [. . .] 'Kneel down,' said the past'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 69, 50; <span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 106). Even Giles, the novel's self-declared "active" character who famously kills a toad-engorged snake in a scene of suggestive homophobia, feels "manacled to a rock" in preparation to watch the pageant, "forced passively to behold indescribable horror."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Whereas dominant modernist feminist movements attempted "to reverse the old association of woman with Nature"—the ideological fiction of nature as passive and unchanging that still permeates critical theory today—Woolf portrays women <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and men alike submitting to a transformative nature, such that submission to it is not a concession of but an acquisition of agency, specifically the participation in universal material differentiation.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> thus offers a queer feminist ethic of submission that parodically repudiates Darwin's, not to mention Hitler's, insistence that women embody hygienic and passive roles in socio-sexual relations mediated by the aesthetic of beauty.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In historical terms, this ethic represents what Theodor Adorno calls modern art's "feeling for nature," or art's ethical attempt to reveal the "wound" of what the Enlightenment aesthetics "of freedom and human dignity" ultimately "oppressed: animal, landscape, woman."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> This wound "is sensually displeasing and repugnant," Adorno writes, and includes feelings involved in "polymorphous sexuality," for the Enlightened aesthetic taboo against nature was in many ways "a sexual one: Nothing should be moist; art becomes hygienic" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AT</span>, 47, 116). Woolf requests such a feeling for nature in her essay "On Being Ill" , wherein she complains that "literature does its best to maintain that its concern is with the mind" and calls for "a new language that we need, more primitive, more sensual, more obscene" that can represent states of physical degradation like illness.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Considering that degeneration was considered a biological ailment and that Woolf declared that "the war is like desperate illness," "On Being Ill" anticipates how Woolf deploys primitive, obscene language in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, during the composition of which she was conscious of her "defiance of professional decency. About being an outsider" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 285, 251).</p>
<p>In her late work, Woolf's feeling for nature consistently emerges in her depictions of how women acquire agency in unhygienic states and locales. Expanding the spatial, temporal, and sensory coordinates of the "sound-proof room" that she requested in 1929 on the feminist logic that "intellectual freedom depends upon material things," Woolf replaces the room of one's own with the prehistoric cave and the public restroom stall (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 49, 101). These rooms are rooms of our own: rooms in which the human species publicly exposes its submission to nature, rooms in which personal freedom depends upon the freedom of material things like bodies themselves.</p>
<p>The conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> features this first kind of space: the cave, an atavistic site of violent sexuality. Discussing Isa and Giles, the married couple whose strained relationship suffuses the novel's pages, the scene reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Left alone together for the first time that day, they were silent. Alone, enmity was bared; also love. Before they slept, they must t; after they had fought, they would embrace. From that embrace another life might be born. But first they must t, as the dog fox ts with the vixen, in the heart of darkness, in the fields of night.</p>
<p>Isa let her sewing drop. The great hooded chairs had become enormous. And Giles too. And Isa too against the window. The window was all sky without colour. The house had lost its shelter. It was night before roads were made, or houses. It was the night that dwellers in caves had watched from some high place among rocks.</p>
<p>Then the curtain rose. They spoke.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 149) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">At first glance, this scene might seem anything but queer, let alone feminist, for it resolves the novel's marriage plot between Isa and Giles, forcing them to both "t" and "embrace" in the night to come, where the word <span style="font-style:italic;">embrace</span> functions as a euphemism for sexual intercourse that "might" reproductively bear "another life." Signaled by an equivocal "might" that includes the possibility of non-reproductive sexual behavior, however, this scene is actually written by a queer character in the novel named Miss La Trobe, who scribes the two plays featured in the novel: the first, the failed pageant play; and the second, the play with which the novel closes but that, unlike the pageant, is not demarcated by discourse tags. With what are ultimately stage directions for a new play, Woolf strips her novel of external mediation here and makes the novel the drama.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>As I will explore more fully in the next section, La Trobe's first play spoils national political and literary tradition through its ironic failure. If the camp aesthetic, construed "in terms of deficiency, decline, and the past [. . .] might be said to function as a kind of <span style="font-style:italic;">ironic</span> nostalgia," the pageant camps its characters' nostalgia for an English history wherein "all the important things had stayed the same."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> As the pageant degenerates into chaos, its audience members degenerate into an emotional collectivity stripped of claims to national identity, one resembling the Society of Outsiders that Woolf claims must reject "all such ceremonies as encourage the desire to impose 'our' civilization or 'our' dominion upon other people" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 114). Before the play, the owners of Pointz Hall admire their own genealogies and how their home was built "'obviously to escape from nature'" despite its proximity to a "cesspool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 6, 3). Yet the owner's sister Mrs. Swithin realizes while reading her "Outline of History" that there were once "rhododendron forests in Piccadilly; when the entire continent [. . .] was all one" and contained "the iguanadon, the mammoth, and the mastadon; from whom, presumably, she thought, jerking the window open, we descend" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 7). Allegorized in the pageant's paratactic disruption of historical continuity, history in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> becomes a circle rather than a line so that Swithin may wonder whether women like herself not only "descend" from mastadons but may be, as Giles' father fears, "'ourselves, degenerate descendants'" and descend to their ancestors' level—may devolve toward nature rather than be able "'to escape from nature'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 34).</p>
<p>La Trobe's second play literalizes this descent and disrupts the heteronormative telos of Isa and Giles' sexual behavior. In its atavistic context, this disruption also unsettles what, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolution's Rainbow</span> , Joan Roughgarden has persuasively proven to be the heteronormative implications of Darwin's theory of sexual selection. La Trobe's ironic euphemism <span style="font-style:italic;">embrace</span>, for example, reads laughably high amid the harrowingly low context of dog fox and vixen ting, which in the early typescript Woolf rendered as their murderous attempt "to tear each other asunder" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 188). These cave-dwellers' sex moreover concludes with biting irony a novel wherein characters wring their hands about what constitutes the "unhygienic" and may parody Hitler's proclamation that "he who would live must t. He who does not wish to t in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist," a proclamation that could derive from Darwin's sentiment that "the season of love is that of battle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 109, 118; <span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 261; <span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 48). It is doubtful that Hitler, who endorses only the most <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  civilized, even superhuman, kinds of sexuality, would agree that animalistic sex is the kind of ting that ensures one's "right to exist."</p>
<p>If, as Jane Marcus argues, Woolf suggests in this scene that "the origin of aggression, war, and oppression is in the origin of the species, in the drama of the battle of the sexes," Woolf also indicates that the comic resolution of such tragic forces may be found by descending to that origin.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Both possibilities inhere in Darwin's unidentified origin of the species, which he calls a "mystery of mysteries" and which is if anything a metonymy for the perpetual transformation of species' identities.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Framed by ironic camping, La Trobe's equivocal "might" responds "yes" to the audience members' collective question about her first failed play: "'D'you think people change? Their clothes, of course. . . . But I mean ourselves'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 83). Submitting to nature, La Trobe suggests, people can and should change much more than their artificial trappings.</p>
<p>As the novel's queerest re, La Trobe in fact insists that sexual feeling itself can change with atavistic devolution. Whereas Elizabeth Abel argues that "heterosexuality is repeatedly insinuated as our covert truth" in res like Isa, Isa maintains an ironic distance from her own heterosexuality throughout the novel.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> The narrator claims that, externally, Isa "never looked like Sappho or one of the beautiful young men whose photographs adorned the weekly papers," yet Isa interally bucks convention: she feels "entangled, by her husband, the stockbroker," for example, and "loathed the domestic, the possessive; the maternal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 11-12, 5, 14). Rather than forcing Isa to capitulate to misogynist oppression, as Marcus argues, La Trobe's script for Isa proposes that she make public such private emotions by denuding herself of the civilized identity that makes her "'loo[k] what she was: Sir Richard's daughter.'"<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>La Trobe strips Isa of this identity by troping her as an animal and cave-dweller. In her atavistic descent, Isa submits to the "enormous" husband of whom "she was afraid," thus literalizing "marriage" as a "damnable servility," yet she thereby grows powefully "enormous" herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 35). Isa gains such agency, I would argue, because La Trobe has made her submit to her ego's shattering, a shattering that releases Isa's private non-normative feelings. As animal and cave-dweller, Isa looks nothing like "Sir Richard's daughter," and her ability to challenge Giles and the social normativity he represents grows proportionally as she allows her queer nature to violate her social identity.</p>
<p>Queering the novel's most seemingly heteronormative woman, La Trobe quells Isa's frustration with her own life's plot: "love and hate—how they tore her asunder! Surely it was time someone invented a new plot, or that the author came out from the bushes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 146). Considering that Isa's age is "the age of the century, thirty nine," her new "plot" could metonymically represent the queer plot that Woolf advises her own era to follow (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 14). Whereas the pageant play records English history, after all, La Trobe's second play records a sexual history wherein reproduction submits to the object world's unpredictable productions and what they "might" bear. In a scene that comprises Woolf's boldest display of queer feminism, La Trobe violates to humble, not condemn, dominant social forms like heterosexuality before nature's queer transformations.</p>
<p>In her final completed piece of writing, a short story titled "The Watering Place" —which she typed palimpsestically on a draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>—Woolf writes a similarly <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  disturbing scene about the end of days from a perch in another obscene room of our own: a toilet in a public women's restroom. Inspired by Woolf's listening to women "powdering &amp; painting, these common little tarts, while I sat, behind a thin door, p—ing as quietly as I could" in "the ladies lavatory at the Sussex Grill at Brighton," the story depicts the daily habits of people in a small seaside town, focally those in a women's restroom pervaded by a "fishy smell" and divided into two sections by a door: "on the one side of the door the claims of nature were gratified; and on the other, at the washing table, at the looking-glass, nature was disciplined by art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 356-7). In a scene of bathroom humor foreshadowed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>,<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Woolf depicts here the irony that women's restrooms are places where people go to defecate and urinate, to let nature run its course, but also to discipline nature through the self-application of cosmetics. The story then documents "three young ladies" who "were exerting their rights upon improving nature, subduing her, with their powder puffs and little red tablets. As they did so they talked; but their talk was interrupted as by the surge of an indrawing tide," the sound of a toilet flushing. As the women gossip about a man whose amorous behavior may lead him to "'be courtmartialled,'" the narrator records the ability of the natural "tide" "to uncove[r] these little fish," the artificial women, and the "queer fishy smell that seems to permeate the whole watering place."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>The "queer fishy smell" of the watering place, or bathroom, is evidently the natural odor of decay that cannot be concealed with "powder puffs and little red tablets." The story concludes with Woolf's dire vision of what the town becomes at night: "The town has sunk down into the water. And the skeleton only is picked out in fairy lamps."<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> When nature dominates civilization—when a town appears "sunk down into the water"—artifice, the "fairy lamps," can only illuminate the denuded core of humanity: "the skeleton." Rather than a grim portrayal of death's inevitability, these sentences offer this otherwise humorous story's serious theme that civilization must strip itself of its constructed identity, especially in the face of more trenchant problems than how carefully one's facial powder is applied or whether a man's sexual behavior warrants legal prosecution. To do otherwise is, as Woolf's skeletal vision evokes, to cultivate race suicide caused by artificial decadence and not, as most degeneration theorists proposed, biophysical degeneration.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> From her stoop on the public toilet, Woolf's narrator encapsulates Woolf's notion in "On Being Ill" that "it is only the recumbent who know what, after all, Nature is at no pains to conceal—that she in the end will conquer [. . .] but with the hook of life in us still we must wriggle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 4: 198). For Woolf, it is not by "conceal[ing]" but by being down, "recumbent" and "ill," that allows one the chance to "wriggle" within the necessarily agonizing process of being biological that Darwin calls the "Struggle for Existence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 77).</p>
<p>"The Watering Place" extends the savage indictment of the cult of beauty that Woolf began in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> not only with its final scene but also with the character Mrs. Manresa, who envisions herself as a "wild child of nature" but who is too preoccupied with upholding her image to engage the world around her, which shows how her "nature was somehow 'just human nature'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 29, 71). During the pageant play's "present day" scene, in fact, in which La Trobe forces the audience to reflect on itself <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by directing her actors to hold mirrors to the spectators, Manresa uses the mirrors to apply her make-up, missing entirely La Trobe's point that, as one of the servants at Pointz Hall thinks, "if it was painful, it was essential. There must be society" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 26). A "woman of action" alone, Manresa wants to dominate nature with artifice, which is for Woolf tantamount to murdering nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 76). Through the example of such characters, Woolf rejects the cult of beauty in which Darwin and Hitler alike inculcate women and proposes in "Watering" that women cultivate themselves in rooms that expose their "queer fishy smell."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>As she does with <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s "embrace," Woolf offers with this story's titular word <span style="font-style:italic;">watering</span>—not to mention her diary's redacted word "p—ing"—a euphemism about obscenity that parodies the cult of sanitization that her narrator hears in the restroom. Both texts' euphemisms exemplify what Walkowitz calls "the tension between decent feelings and dissenting thought" in Woolf's work that produce "models of social critique that would resist social codification."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Woolf uses euphemism here in part to parody wartime propaganda's own sanitary euphemisms of health and heroism. Like David Jones, who in his long poem <span style="font-style:italic;">In Parenthesis</span>  mocks the technology of modern warfare for producing a "perfectly sanitary war," Woolf derides civilized decency as ethically indecent: as culpable for the violence it conceals with ethical platitudes or, in the case of "Watering," cosmetics.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> To refuse this discussion is to relegate the ineluctable conclusion of biological being, what Woolf called the "tremendous experience" of death, to fodder for either egoistic ideals or the patronizing presumption that death is the failure of life (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 230). If Woolf's camp renderings of a couple's violent sex or a town's mass death disturb, then, it is because she does violence to our own attempts to sanitize death, attempts that are for her a violence to death—and the life that led to it—itself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If "p—ing" is what happens in Woolf's public restroom stall, "f—ing" is what happens not only in her atavistic cave but also throughout the degenerate, theatrical world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>. Woolf uses such euphemisms at the level of diction to place into relief the obscenity she depicts through dramatic form, including the obscenity of national and literary tradition. The novel's rising curtain, after all, makes theatre of Isa and Giles' intercourse, locating laughable and terrifying private acts on the public page and stage. Woolf offers this scene of "f—ing" as her own contribution to the literary and national histories she mocks in the pageant play, using the drama to concentrate—both distill and make public—the novel of interiority. Opposed to her view in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that her "Society of Outsiders," "remaining outside, will experiment not with public means in public but with private means in private," the Society of Outsiders in the book that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Woolf herself called "the wild, the experimental" literally remains outside, experimenting with private means in public both to strip privacy of its location in the self and to shock the public into a concentrated collectivity (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 113; <span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 228).</p>
<p>The very title of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> suggests how Woolf uses the drama to distill particularities, for she changed the title from "Pointz Hall, the Pageant: the Play—finally [to] Between the Acts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 356). Moving from a specific location steeped in national identity through particular artistic forms to an abstract concept of liminality, the title's mutation allegorizes how Woolf's aesthetic of concentration propagates variety by despoiling singularity. Such variety, she writes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, includes "all lit. discussed in connection with real little incongruous living humour; &amp; anything that comes into my head; but 'I' rejected: 'We' substituted [. . .] perpetual variety &amp; change from intensity to prose. &amp; facts—&amp; notes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 135). With the "perpetual variety &amp; change" of the novel's form, Woolf substitutes the singular "I" of modernist interiority with a collective "we" that feels the novel's "variety of moods," including "incongruous living humor."</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s titular transformation also highlights Woolf's career-long fascination with the tension between the novel and the drama, about which she ultimately theorized a relationship. She claimed that "it's possible that the novel to us is what the drama was to the Greeks" and Elizabethans and valued especially their comedies' "very sharp delicate laughter."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> When she goes on to compare contemporary novels with "the comic passages" of Elizabethan plays, Woolf claims that "the emotion [is] all split up, dissipated and then woven together, slowly and gradually massed into a whole, in the novel; the emotion concentrated, generalised, heightened in the play."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> Woolf suggests here that the novel, which distills emotion from the general ("split up") to the particular ("massed into a whole"), might learn from the drama, especially comedy, how to distill and thereby proliferate emotion from the "concentrated" particular to the "generalised" plurality.</p>
<p>In "The Narrow Bridge of Art" , Woolf explains how this generic concentration is both aesthetically and affectively queer. She mourns the loss of poetic drama from contemporary letters because drama can encompass "monstrous, hybrid, unmanageable emotions," "this discord, this incongruity, this sneer, this contrast, this curiosity, the quick, queer emotions": in short, "that queer conglomeration of incongruous things—the modern mind."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Because the novel has, she writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, been burdened by "the dominance of the letter 'I' and the aridity [. . .] it cases within its shade" , the novel that survives literary tradition "will be dramatic, and yet not a play. It will be read, not acted. By what name we are to call it is not a matter of very great importance."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Here Woolf encompasses the formal and epistemological premises of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, which shall be a "monstrous, hybrid" book that, like the collective queer feeling it examines, defies taxonomy, or "what name we are to call it."</p>
<p>On the structural level of narrative form, Woolf's dramatic theory of fiction shapes how <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> conveys the conflict between individual and collective experience. Woolf outlines these effects in her uncompleted essay "Anon," which she began to write just after completing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and which she intended to be a history of English literature. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  In the text, Woolf envisions an androgynous character named Anon, similar to the writer she had envisioned in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, a "sometimes man; sometimes woman" who "lives a roaming life" singing "the call to our primitive instincts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 91-2; <span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 675). A metonymy for "the theatre," Anon represents the kind of atavistic, anti-identitarian self that Woolf wants, but purposefully fails, to produce in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 678). "Anonymity was a great possession" in the age of drama, she argues, but modern literature requires that "the individual on the stage becomes more and more differentiated," such that "the theatre must be replaced by the theatre of the brain. The playwright is replaced by the man who writes a book. The audience is replaced by the reader. Anon is dead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 692, 693). Resurrecting Anon in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s theatrical form, Woolf also threatens Anon's anonymity with the novel form's focus on individuality, as evidenced by the pageant's playwright, who is both sexed and named—though only, importantly, surnamed. Identity's threat to Anon thus constitutes the formal and thematic drama of Woolf's novel.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, Woolf maintained that this conflict was best conveyed through the mode of comedy. She believed that "you can only get comedy by using the surface layer," but such surfaces are for her detritus to be stripped away, revealing "much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface" and "the most enduring form of life [in] scenes which are outwardly trivial" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 347, 197). An admirer of Jane Austen's comedies, Woolf averred that such comedic stripping was an eminently feminist mode.<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> In her 1905 essay "The Value of Laughter," for example, Woolf writes that "comedy is of the sex of the graces and the muses," whereas tragedy's "decorous [. . .] spirit of solemnity" is male (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 58). As it has throughout literary history, "comedy has a hard t for it," Woolf believes, because laughter is said to be "an inarticulate utterance like the bark of a dog or the bleat of sheep, and it is beneath the dignity of a race that has made itself a language to express itself thus" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 58-9). Co-opting such misogyny, Woolf embraces the bestial, "inarticulate utterance" as a tool with which to humble, for "laughter more than anything else preserves our sense of proportion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 59). Whereas men are burdened with the "hideous excrescences that have overgrown our modern life, the pomps and conventions and dreary solemnities," women possess, Woolf says, "a knife that both prunes and trains": the "flash of laughter which, like lightning, shrivels them [the excrescences] up and leaves the bones bare."<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>Such pruning is central to Woolf's antifascist politics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, she claims that "laughter as an antidote to dominance is perhaps indicated," laughter that allows one "to strip each statement of its [. . .] vanity motive [. . .] before you make up your mind which fact about politics to believe" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 182, 96). Just as laughter prunes fascism's vanity, generic hybridity dismantles fascist attempts to dominate variety with purity. Woolf in fact complains in her essay "Modern Fiction"  that the writer "seems constrained [. . .] by some powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall to provide a plot, to provide comedy, tragedy, love, interest, and an air of probability embalming the whole."<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> Rejecting that tyrant's dictates, Woolf yearns for a style about which "it is impossible to say 'this is comic,' or 'that is tragic,'"<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> a style that might take the shape of formal opacity: as she writes, "Ease and freedom, the power to change and the power to grow, can only be preserved by obscurity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 14). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The "obscurity" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s formal structure ironically derives from its very light pageant play, which paratactically juxtaposes scenes from English comedies resembling texts like <span style="font-style:italic;">As You Like It</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Love for Love</span>. Woolf replicates the pageant's confusing parataxis at the level of her narrative's diegesis. In the novel's first fifty-three pages, an unidentified narrator reports the actions, speech, and interior thoughts of various characters (the latter through free indirect discourse). When the play begins, however, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> consists primarily of staged dialogue and of dialogue between and among the audience members in response to the play, itself an obscuring narratological technique since actors' and characters' speech often blur together such that characters wonder, "was it, or was it not, the play?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 53). With intermittent narrative and stream-of-consciousness paragraphs, this dialogue continues for eighty-three pages; the text then reverts to narrative mediation in the remaining nineteen pages. Altogether, then, the play and characters' dialogue about the play—Isa says, "'I wish the play didn't run in my head'"—arguably occupies more space in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> than does the narrative reportage.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>Given this proportion, why, if Woolf thought that "Pointz Hall is to become in the end a play," did she frame that play within prose narrative (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5:139)? An answer to this question resides in the novel's title, which invokes not only the plot's temporal location between two acts of world war but its structural division between two kinds of speech act: the mediated and the unmediated. Framed between its mediated narrative acts, the characters' increasingly unmediated dramatic speech—such that even scripted theatrical speech comes to resemble spontaneous public utterance—exposes them at their most individually and collectively concentrated forms. As Froula persuasively argues, "in the acts between the acts, and in the spectators' thoughts and feelings, pageant and novel seek a 'natural law' by which to build civilization's broken 'wall.'"<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> Unable to understand the play's paratactic structure, the audience members abandon private reflection and attempt to communicate verbally about the text's meaning; in doing so, they imitate the natural world around them, "the trees tossing and the birds swirling [who] seemed called out of their private lives [. . .] and made to take part" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 129-30; 80-1).</p>
<p>Woolf uses the drama to elicit public feelings from her private characters, then, going so far as to represent their private thoughts in public form. When Giles "said (without words), 'I'm damnably unhappy,'" for example, William Dodge and Isa "echoed" and "thought" in response "'So am I'" and "'I too,'" respectively (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 119). Violating novelistic privacy by publicizing the individual's thoughts as dramatic speech, Woolf allegorizes in this passage the conflict between the novel and the drama genres. In distilled, simple sentences, the passage reports only the audience's negative feelings. In accord with Woolf's comparison of these genres, the drama concentrates the novelistic characters' emotions such that Isa later realizes the pageant "was only there to beget emotion. There were only two emotions: love; and hate. There was no need to puzzle out the plot" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 63). If, as Darwin writes, "laughter" is "analogous with weeping" because both release "superfluous nervous energy," Woolf strips her characters of superfluous affects with a play that enjoins them to feel in concentrated form.<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>What La Trobe repeatedly calls the play's "failure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 68, 142) thus produces distilled, incongruous emotions in the audience and what Sontag would call a "naïve, or pure, Camp" aesthetic in the novel, one in which "the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naïve" ("Notes," 59). La Trobe in all earnestness aims to create "a vision imparted [that] was relief from agony," and when that vision fails, she reacts in the most "exaggerated" and "passionate" of terms: "Blood seemed to pour from her shoes. This is death, death, death, she noted in the margin of her mind; when illusion fails" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 68, 122). Since biological death does threaten the entire community, La Trobe's "fantastic" response appears laughably naïve, as does her literalist attempt at play's end to make the community reflect upon itself with mirrors. Although La Trobe wants in this scene "to expose them, as it were, to douche them, with present-time reality," her "douche" simply confuses her audience, who wonders, "'if we're left asking questions, isn't it a failure, as a play?'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 122, 135). Since the British pageant play traditionally functioned to glorify empire, yet this play ends with La Trobe lecturing her audience about how they're "<span style="font-style:italic;">Liars most of us. Thieves too</span>," one might answer "yes" to the audience's question (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 127). But as a play whose camp failure yields the audience's public intimacy, the pageant succeeds.</p>
<p>As a character, La Trobe embodies the very camp aesthetic that her play produces. She "had the look of a commander pacing his deck" and "the attitude proper to an Admiral," for example, yet La Trobe captains a small community play whose props consist of "cardboard crowns, swords made of silver paper, turbans that were sixpenny dish cloths"—a night at the Hippodrome this is not (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 43). La Trobe's entire life is in fact filled with failures: "Rumour said that she had kept a tea shop at Winchester; that had failed. She had been an actress. That had failed. She had bought a four-roomed cottage and shared it with an actress. They had quarrelled" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 40). While she actually shared a bed with that actress, La Trobe—like Dodge, the novel's would-be gay male character—is never identified as a lesbian in the text: she fails, one could say, to achieve that identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143).</p>
<p>La Trobe is so prone to failure that one might call her a masochist, or a Darwinian feminist, for she continually seeks ways to abuse herself. This sentiment was dear to Woolf herself: in 1934, for example, after learning of Wyndham Lewis's latest decrial of her work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Men Without Art</span> , Woolf writes that "I am feeling the calm that always comes to me with abuse: my back is against the wall [. . .] the queer disreputable pleasure in being abused—in being a re, in being a martyr. &amp; so on" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 251). Feeling powerless, backed up against the wall—the same phrase she uses to describe England in wartime and to describe how she does her "best work"—Woolf claims that "the feeling of being dismissed into obscurity is also pleasant &amp; salutary," for abuse teaches her to "to be supple &amp; naked to the truth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 297, 189, 252). In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf summarizes this view in aesthetic terms: she converts "moments [that] brought with them a peculiar horror and a physical collapse; they seemed dominant; myself passive" into a source of aesthetic pleasure and inspiration, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  such that "these sudden shocks [. . .] are now always welcome [. . .] And so I go on to suppose that the shock-receiving capacity is what makes me a writer." Violence thus teaches Woolf "that we—I mean all human beings—are connected with [. . .] the work of art [. . .] we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>With an acute "shock-receiving capacity" herself, La Trobe takes a "queer disreputable pleasure in being abused" and dismisses herself into obscurity for much of the pageant, central though she is to its creation. If "she was an outcast," as the narrator reports, whom "Nature had somehow set [. . .] apart from her kind," La Trobe casts herself further into nature's kind as she barks orders at actors and audience alike from behind a tree (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143, 53). Posed in "a stooping position" for much of the play, La Trobe is a diva without an audience, an admiral of a mutinous crew, a leader with only half a name (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 141). She is a camp failure as a character who embodies the dialectic between states of particularity and generality, identity and anonymity, that she, like Woolf, attempts to communicate with art wherein "all human beings—are connected."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Comedy of Natures</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the plays that La Trobe composes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> could be called comedies of nature insofar as that mode's plot resembles a modernist degeneration narrative. In their relative discordance—the first more humorous, the second more harrowing—the plays comprise <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s own comedy of nature and proliferate the "infinitely varied diversities" and "variety of moods" that both Darwin and Woolf see in the concentrated world. Proliferating natures in nature—a material world where non-self-identity reigns supreme—Woolf parodies what Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno call fascism's endeavor "to place oppressed nature's rebellion against domination directly in the service of domination."<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> Bearing out Stephen Barber's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> "vigorously confronts the homophobic impulse of modern British culture to extinguish queer existence," the more that nature dominates in this novel, the more that its queer natures rebel against social domination.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>In point of fact, despite their attempts to escape from nature, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s audience members watch the pageant play outdoors, which allows nature to interrupt the performance repeatedly, such that the natural and the theatrical fuse.<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> Most remarkably, just when La Trobe likens the play to death for failing, a herd of cows, as a campy <span style="font-style:italic;">deus ex machina</span>, "t[akes] up the burden" and begins to bellow, for "one had lost her calf": "From cow after cow came the same yearning bellow. The whole world was filled <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  with dumb yearning." This "primeval voice" transitions from tragic mourning to comic perversity, however, when "the whole herd caught the infection. Lashing their tails, blobbed like pokers, they tossed their heads high, plunged and bellowed, as if Eros had planted his dart in their flanks and goaded them to fury. The cows annihilated the gap; bridged the distance; filled the emptiness and continued the emotion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96). Tragic, comic, and above all theatrical, Woolf's campy cows bridge the gaps in La Trobe's paratactic play: the missing link in this literary history is nature.</p>
<p>Violating the play's attempt to consolidate human history, the cows are what Adorno would call the pageant play's "wound": they are the play's feeling for nature, for they show how "the reticence of nature was undone, and the barriers which should divide Man the Master from the Brute were dissolved" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 125). The cows dissolve that barrier by spreading their affective "infection" to the audience, as when "suddenly the cows stopped; lowered their heads, and began browsing. Simultaneously the audience lowered their heads and read their programmes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96). Ruining the play, the cows ruin the audience's grip on its anthropocentrism: the audience becomes a herd led not by a dictator but by nature, specifically its incongruous, theatrically displayed feelings. Woolf allows nature to take back its claim to humanity by offering such scenes in which "nature takes her part" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 130). As La Trobe muses in the text's early typescript, "The great bosom of nature, she thought, takes our failures; but after all, she needs them."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to Marina MacKay's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s "closing emphasis on disintegration and fracture is so extreme that no centre could hold these characters together," the novel depicts nature as the unstable "centre" to which its failed characters concentrate.<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Locating the drama of identity and its concentration in the dash between the repeated words "<span style="font-style:italic;">Unity—Dispersity</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> depicts a social world in constant vacillation between collectivity and individuality (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 136). When the audience "t[akes] up the strain" of the pageant's refrain "<span style="font-style:italic;">Dispersed are we</span>," then, they ultimately perform a version of Woolf's concentrated camp: they ruminate about their own fracture, producing at play's end what reads like a collective stream of consciousness (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 66, 134-5). As Woolf's most innovative formal attempt to collapse the novel and the drama, this moment employs the most individually concentrated of modernist techniques to unite and disperse the text's characters. Such oscillation between civilization and nature, individuality and collectivity leads Mrs. Swithin to reflect that "sheep, cows, grass, trees, ourselves—all are one. If discordant, producing harmony [. . .] the agony of the particular sheep, cow, or human being is necessary [. . .] <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> is harmony, could we hear it," for we do not live in ourselves, she realizes: "We live in others."<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>With her first comedy, La Trobe helps the audience to "hear" Woolf's belief that "agony [. . .] is necessary" to produce "harmony." With her second play, La Trobe helps herself to hear to it. Her humiliation after the first comedy fails leads La Trobe to degenerate emotionally: "What she wanted, like that carp [. . .] was darkness in the mud; a whisky and soda at the pub; and coarse words descending like maggots through the waters" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 138). Absorbing the shock of her failure, La Trobe becomes enthusiastic about a new play but cannot conceive of its language: "'I should group them,' she <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  murmured, 'here.' It would be midnight; there would be two res, half concealed by a rock. The curtain would rise. What would the first words be? the words escaped her" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143). But when she looks on a picture of "a cow in a stable; also at a cock and a hen," La Trobe finds her inspiration for those words in degeneration: "Words of one syllable sank down into the mud. [. . .] The mud became fertile. Words rose above the intolerably laden dumb oxen plodding through the mud. Words without meaning—wonderful words" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 144).</p>
<p>Able now to "hear it," La Trobe finds the "more primitive, more obscene" language—words fresh from the mud—with which Woolf writes <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and with which La Trobe composes her new play, the play that closes <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and that unites, by concentrating the conflict between, the novel and the drama. In accord with Horkheimer and Adorno's belief that "only when apprehended as knowledge does [nature] become the urge of the living toward peace, the consciousness which, from the beginning, has inspired unerring resistance to <span style="font-style:italic;">Führer</span> and collective," La Trobe's temporary degeneration—her submission to the overpowering facts of nature—yields her regeneration, her ability to find peace within her failures.<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s final sentence, "They spoke," thus offers La Trobe's hopeful gesture that her comedies of nature will yield a new dialogue about our objects of concentration. Produced by her two comedies of love and hate, this dialogue might begin with the word "peace." As Isa earlier thinks, "peace was the third emotion. Love. Hate. Peace. Three emotions made the ply of human life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 64). It is Woolf's queer ambition with <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> to transform Isa's thought into speech, so that we might "hear it," perhaps even say it: so that peace might become the object of her public's concentration.</p>

Woolf's personal records and her final novel suggest that, whereas death marks the end of distraction and concentration both, the threat of death—the affective and psychic violation of the ego's boundaries—might motivate concentration.

Herring examines a queer modernist literary tradition in which "queer" denotes not just the non-normative but the verbs "to puzzle" or "to spoil, put out of order," especially "to spoil (a person's) undertaking" . Whereas Herring proves how such spoilage undermines any attempt at community , however, Woolf creates a society of the spoiled: a society where feeling degenerate is a vehicle for social concentration.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>Woolf repeatedly tropes "living near to the bone" throughout her diary entries of this period. Most notably, after the bombing of her home in Tavistock Square during the Blitz, Woolf writes that "its odd, the relief at losing possessions. I shd like to start life, in peace, almost bare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 332). One of the few possessions that Woolf recovered from this bombing was a collection of Darwin's writings .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>As revealed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall: The Earlier and Later Typescripts of</span> Between the Acts, ed. Mitchell A. Leaska (New York: University Publications, 1983), Woolf enacted such emotional distillation in each draft of the novel. In general, Woolf made the text more humorous and less violent. As discussed on page 649 of this essay, for example, the novel's conclusion first ended with Isa and Giles intending a far more violent encounter than their ultimate "t." Moreover, the three emotions that Isa finally feels—"love, hate, peace"—were initially "four emotions [that] made the ply of man's life" in the drafts, where love and hate remained constant and were coupled alternately with "fear," "death," and "sorrow" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 105, 103-5). In the novel's final iteration, Woolf distills these negative feelings to "hate," which (like love) could but need not produce fear, death, and sorrow. Correcting her emotions' negative imbalance, Woolf focalizes how the incongruity between love and hate might produce "peace," a pacifist vision that relies not just on a concentration of emotional states but on the simultaneously positive and negative emotions that the camp aesthetic enjoins. <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall</span> hereafter abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f17" href="#f17-text">17. </a>Woolf could not have known of Hitler's Final Solution, announced in 1942, nor of the extermination camps; however, concentration camps that held political prisoners, Jews, homosexuals, and other persecuted people were beginning to be used for eugenic cleansing when Woolf finished <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>. One might nonetheless question the ethical or, more simply, the analytical use of contemplating Woolf's relation to the concentration camps if she not only did not live to know about their ultimate horror but did not herself experience the camps. Such an objection would rely, as Amy Hungerford writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Holocaust of Texts: Genocide, Literature, and Personification</span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), on the trend in Holocaust studies wherein "memory (the knowledge of what we have experienced) is privileged over learning," a position that limits imagination to identity . Yet "there is reason to believe that a just society requires imagination," not just memory, Hungerford writes, on the logic that "we must find not ourselves in the other (or the other in ourselves) but the other as we can know them without being them" . In my own imaginative endeavor to understand how Woolf aestheticizes WWII in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, I am analyzing not only Woolf's experience of the concentration camps, being placed in which seemed to her an acute threat, but her imagination of them—one that breaches an ethics of memory in the name of an ethics of imagination.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f18" href="#f18-text">18. </a>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific and Estoteric Studies in Sexual Degeneration in Mankind and in Animals</span> trans. Ulrich Van Der Horst (New York: Anthropological Press, 1932), Charles Samson Féré distinguished degeneration from atavism , but Cesare Lombroso—one of the first proponents of atavistic theory—held the majority view by, in texts like <span style="font-style:italic;">Genio e follia</span> (Genius and Insanity)  and <span style="font-style:italic;">L'uomo delinquente</span> (Criminal Man) , aligning degenerates with prior forms of biological development, whether in non-human animal or human stages (Daniel Pick, <span style="font-style:italic;">Faces of Degeneration: A European Disorder, c. 1848-1918</span> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989], 120). Darwin himself did not equate degeneracy and atavism: for him, reversion could be beneficial, destructive, or neutral, depending on the variation (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 124, 236). In his 1895 polemic <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneration</span> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993), Max Nordau voiced his agreement with Lombroso while expanding the definition of degeneracy so capaciously that it could include nearly anything that evoked a negative feeling (555-6). As Sander Gilman claims, "Degeneracy became as key for explaining the negative moments of human history as it was for explaining evolutionary regression in biology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Difference and Pathology: Stereotypes of Sexuality, Race, and Madness</span> [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985], 205). In its ultimate capaciousness, the term <span style="font-style:italic;">degenerate</span> came to denote in the 20<sup>th</sup> century—and still denotes today—a qualitative mode of experience rather than an identity: from a scientific perspective, degeneracy can refer to a process of biophysical enervation and/or reversion; and from an aesthetic perspective, degeneracy denotes a range of qualities associated with the negative but especially qualities (sexual license, aesthetic experimentation, racial otherness) that contradict dominant expectations for civilized culture. For more on modernist theories of degeneracy and atavism, see Dana Seitler's <span style="font-style:italic;">Atavistic Tendencies: The Culture of Science in American Modernity</span> (Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press, 2008) and Eugene Talbot's <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneracy: Its Causes, Signs and Results</span> (New York: Scribner's, 1898).</p></div>

Yet Jed Esty calls the novel "a tragic document of the liberal imagination under pressure, forced to confront the political limitations of the 'English way'" , and Mitchell Leaska nominates it as no less than "the longest suicide note in the English language" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 451). Despite their diametrically opposing views, these scholars are not only writing about the same novel but highlighting crucial elements of this incongruous text that mutually inform Woolf's vision of a queer feminist politics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiction and Repetition: Seven English Novels</span> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), J. Hillis Miller attends most faithfully to this dual sentiment when he writes that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> is throughout, especially in the pageant, a work of outrageous and hilarious parody [. . .] Parody is repetition as praise, but it is destruction too" .</p></div>

As Michael North disclaims in <span style="font-style:italic;">Machine-Age Comedy</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), any attempt at defining the comedic mode is challenging, if not impossible, because its manifestations have changed throughout literary and theatrical history—itself a subject of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s pageant play . For the purposes of this argument, nontheless, it is worth noting that the mode classically features several of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s formal structures. In terms of character, comedy typically focuses upon a society rather than individuals such that, in narrative terms, comedy lacks a stand-out protagonist. Comedic societies consist, Aristotle records in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetics</span>, of base characters: "Comedy aims at representing men as worse [. . .] Tragedy as better than in actual life" . The comedy is "an imitation of characters of a lower type," then, where "lower" is determined by "some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive" . Because of this focus, comedy has, in the history of Western literature and performance, assumed an inferior role to tragedy, that "highest" of dramatic forms, ironically because tragedy charts the degeneration of a privileged (typically male) character to ignominy . In terms of plot, comedy presents a conflict that destabilizes and then restores the status quo with which the plot opens . Comedy may be deemed structurally atavistic, then, for it returns to its origin rather than develops toward some inevitable telos, the linear goal of tragedy . See James English's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comic Transactions: Literature, Humor, and the Politics of Community in Twentieth-Century Britain</span> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1994) for a compelling examination of comedy in British modernism, including in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, and Joseph Meeker's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Comedy of Survival: Literary Ecology and a Play Ethic</span> (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1997) for an insightful discussion of the structural similarities between comedy and evolution.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f23" href="#f23-text">23. </a>Darwin bases this claim on the evidence of innocuous racial differences, which show <span style="font-style:italic;">homos sapiens</span> to "have remained extremely variable, owing, as it seems, to their variations being of an indifferent nature, and consequently to their having escaped the action of natural selection" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 249).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f24" href="#f24-text">24. </a>Following Woolf's lead, I avoid the term "tragicomedy" to describe this novel not only because that mode has proven even more difficult to define in literary history than tragedy and comedy but because no definition of the mode attends to the plot reversal I am describing here, wherein tragedy's plot is made comedic. The most standard definitions of tragicomedy are that it features tragedy's danger without its deaths (<span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> features several reports of death and a bloody murder); that it reverses the roles of gods and slaves (<span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> abjures the god role, or elevation, altogether to propose total degradation); and that it envisions a yet unrealized future, whereas Woolf gives her characters that future in the atavistic past. See Verna Foster's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy</span> (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004) for further discussion of the mode.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>By describing Darwin's theory of nature as queer, I mean to highlight that Darwin theorizes the material world as endlessly mutable and non-normative (defiant of any telos or regulatory standard) and therefore inclusive of what would by any era's terms of sexual normativity be deemed non-normative sexual feeling. In the past few years, a spate of scholarship written largely from an ecocritical perspective has addressed the concept of a "queer nature," including Myra J. Hird's "Naturally Queer" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Feminist Theory</span> 5.1 [2004]: 85-9), Timothy Morton's "Queer Ecology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 125.2 [March 2010], 1-19), and Catriona Mortimer-Sandliands and Bruce Erickson's edited volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Queer Ecologies: Sex,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature, Politics, Desire</span> (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2010).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f33" href="#f33-text">33. </a>As Isherwood portrays in his 1939 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Goodbye to Berlin</span> (in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Berlin Stories</span> [New York: New Directions, 1963]), German cabaret performances featured similar blends of horror and humor to ridicule the Nazi regime, which quickly closed the cabarets upon its rise to power. Though Woolf rejects those cabarets' investment in camp's material trappings, it is worth noting that Isherwood's descriptions of Sally Bowles's nails as "hard, bright, ugly little beetles"  and her coat as the "skin of a mangy old dog"  anticipate Woolf's atavistic aesthetic. Though they lack Woolf's comedy of nature, many artistic texts have used concentrated camp to examine the Holocaust. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Laughter in Hell:The Use of Humor during the Holocaust</span> (London: Jason Aronson Inc., 1991), Steve Lipman records a substantial portion of such texts, including Charlie Chaplin's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Dictator</span> —which was itself subject to ethical scrutiny, including Chaplin's own after the war —Tadeusz Borowski's short story collection <span style="font-style:italic;">This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</span> , Mel Brooks' slapstick film and Broadway musical <span style="font-style:italic;">The Producers</span> (1968, 2001), Peter Barnes' play <span style="font-style:italic;">Auschwitz</span> , Art Spiegelman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Maus I</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Maus II</span> , Robert Benigni's film <span style="font-style:italic;">Life is Beautiful</span> , and Jonathan Safran Foer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything Is Illuminated</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</span> . Rodney Ackland's 1951 play <span style="font-style:italic;">Absolute Hell</span> (London: Oberon Books, 1990) is of particularly relevant note, since it features a group of queer characters that gathers in a bar after WWII to talk about the relationship between the prison camps and the camp aesthetic, a relationship one character synthesizes as "horror camp" (36, 38, 56).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f34" href="#f34-text">34. </a>Lipman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Laughter in Hell</span>, 9; Viktor Frankl, <span style="font-style:italic;">Man's Search for Meaning: an Introduction to Logotherapy</span>, trans.

Frankl warns against pious attitudes toward camp victims "mingled with sentiment and pity"  and records that the camps were filled with a rigorous ethic of humor, even as (and surely because) "the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded" . "Humor was another of the soul's weapons in the t for self-preservation," he writes, as evidenced by Lipman's record of how children in the camps played games like "Gas Chamber" and "Gestapo Agent" and how prisoners formed a clandestine theatrical group in Dachau, scribing and performing plays with lines like "Everything is hell / Soon it will get well / Through this magic word: humor, humor!" (42, 14, 72). Such humor was necessary, Frankl writes, in the face of the apathy that often accrued from witnessing so much suffering. Indeed, "disgust, horror and pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel any more" because death and decay "became such commonplace sights" . Humor allowed a kind of ironic shock to the apathetic system, Frankl avers, "a trick learned while mastering the art of living" . Frankl also records that camp life required a "retreat to a more primitive form of mental life": one stripped of civilized provisions wherein "the effort of having to concentrate on just saving one's skin led to a total disregard of anything not serving that purpose," which "explain[s] the prisoners' complete lack of sentiment" (27, 32).</p></div>

Although scholars have focused profitably on the implications of Woolf's reading of Freud while she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> (see Cuddy-Keane, "Politics of Comic Modes," 274), few scholars have considered her perhaps even more remarkable attention to Darwin's work while composing the novel. For analyses that begin to broach Woolf's engagement with evolutionary science in this text, see Harriet Blodgett's "The Nature of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Language Studies</span> 13.3 [Summer 1983]: 27-37, 36); Gillian Beer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: The Common Ground</span> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996); and Elizabeth Lambert's "Evolution and Imagination in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>" (in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: Themes and Variations</span>, eds.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f50" href="#f50-text">50. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 49) Woolf's call for a Darwinian feminist epistemology here anticipates Grosz's contemporary intervention into feminist politics in both <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution and the Untimely</span> (Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2004) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Travels: Feminism, Nature, Power</span> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2005). Writes Grosz, "A reconration of nature as dynamic, of matter as culturally productive, of time as a force of proliferation, is thus central to the ways feminism itself may be able <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to move beyond the politics of equalization to more actively embrace a politics affirmative of difference elaborated in the most dynamic forms of feminist theory today" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nick of Time</span>, 72). Grosz's study insists perhaps too limitedly, however, on what she calls Darwin's being "one of the few thinkers of the nineteenth century to prere, not simply an egalitarian feminism, but a feminism, or perhaps more broadly, an ontology of sexual difference" wherein such binary difference is "irreducible" (10, 67). This irreducibility would appear to defy Grosz's (let alone Darwin's own) claims to nature's non-binary variability. As Joan Roughgarden has more recently and extensively in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People</span> (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004), Grosz acknowledges, after all, that sexual selection "produces variations—the intersexes—that lie between bifurcated categories," such that "the posthuman future is more likely to be sexually differentiated (in whatever form) than anything else we recognize in the present" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nick of Time</span>, 67).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f51" href="#f51-text">51. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 69, 41-2) Giles kills the animals because the snake-toad looks to him like "birth the wrong way round—a monstrous inversion" . With his heteronormative, masculinist logic about right ways to reproduce, Giles condemns "inversion"—a <span style="font-style:italic;">fin-de-siecle</span> sexological term for queerness—and thereby the novel's queer characters. Giles specifically targets William Dodge, a man whom Woolf refuses to taxonomize as homosexual but whom Giles thinks of as a "perversion" and who is elsewhere described (sometimes self-described) as a "half-breed" , "a toady" , a "half-man," and "a flickering, mind-divided little snake in the grass" . Woolf in fact denies her characters the ability to name Dodge's "perversion" by anything other than these bestial labels , a fact that coincides with Stephen Barber's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> "stages a deliberate resistance to regulatory procedures of labeling homosexuality by giving the name 'Dodge' [. . .] to a gay character" ("Lip-Reading: Woolf's Secret Encounters," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction</span>, ed. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997], 401-443, 403). Further buttressing Barber's claim, Woolf changed a sentence about Dodge in the early typescript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> from "Can you condemn people for their sexuality?" to "Can you condemn people for the way they feel?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 81). Rejecting the identitarian terms on which sexuality has been regulated and condemned since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Woolf prefers to think of sex in terms of mutable affectional states rather than any particular taxonomic "sexuality."</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f53" href="#f53-text">53. </a>Although this phrase may seem to be a contradiction in anti-identitarian and identitarian terms, I mean "queer feminism" to be aligned with Woolf's own hybrid politics, that which acts on behalf of historical political outsiders, even as it anticipates a vision beyond the need for such political action. Woolf envisions, as Grosz describes, a feminist theory that engages "the struggle to render more mobile, fluid, and transformable the means by which the female subject is produced and represented" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time Travels</span>, 193).</p></div>

Robert Hullot-Kentor (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997), 71, 62-3; hereafter abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">AT</span>. Adorno claims that art that has a "feeling for nature" does not master nature rationally but temporarily suspends its inevitable loss in the polymorphous realm of historical feeling . Indeed, Adorno, like Darwin, posits that that which derives from nature, "purportedly ahistorical, is at its core historical" . Art's feeling for nature—the suspension of loss, what Woolf might call a moment of concentration—is therefore, in Adorno's view, "all the more compelling for its ephemeralness": it is, like camp, both hopeful and sorrowful at once .</p></div>

This sentiment is not actually new to Woolf, though it might be newly expressed in her fiction of this era. In a book review as early as 1918, after all, Woolf writes, "Perhaps it is coarseness—the quality that is the most difficult of all for the educated to come by—that is lacking. By coarseness we mean something as far removed from vulgarity as can be. We mean something vehement, full-throated, carrying down in its rush sticks and stones and fragments of human nature pell-mell" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Writers</span> [New York: Mariner, 1976], 89).</p></div>

The most precise—yet still tentative ("appears")—origin of not only the species <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span> but the "whole vertebrate kingdom" is thus a queer body, a body that vacillates between binary Victorian constructions of sex. Accordingly, Darwin claims in his theory of reversion that even gender differences bear the mark of undifferentiated similarities between gendered bodies, for all reproductive systems contain "a part which is always present and efficient in the one sex, being represented in the other by a mere rudiment," as in the case of mammary glands and homologous constructions like the uterus and vesicula (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 30-1). Contradicting his rigid schema of sexual selection, then, Darwin's theory of reversion posits that gender differences always bear the stamp of their undifferentiated origin.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f66" href="#f66-text">66. </a>Woolf elsewhere explicitly links women's self-aestheticization with Nazi politics. In "Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid," Woolf writes that "the subconscious Hitlerism that holds us down is the desire for aggression; the desire to dominate and enslave. Even in the darkness we can see that made visible. We can see shop windows blazing; and women gazing; painted women; dressed-up women; women with crimson lips and crimson fingernails. They are slaves who are trying to enslave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 4: 174). Although one might balk at Woolf's comparison of window-shopping to fascism here, her interest in Darwinian science and Nazi politics at this time may explain how she conceives of women's inculcation into a cult of aesthetic beauty being tantamount to the supposedly civilized endeavors of Nazi domination.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f73" href="#f73-text">73. </a><span style="font-style:italic;">Ibid.</span>, 18. This is one of Woolf's more consistent aesthetic positions. In her plans for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, for example, Woolf writes that the novel "should include satire, comedy, poetry, narrative, &amp; what form is to hold them all together? Should I bring in a play, letters, poems?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 152). In "Modern Novels," similarly, Woolf envisions the possibility of creating "a vague general confusion in which the clear-cut features of the tragic, the comic, the passionate, and the lyrical were dissolved beyond the possibility of separate recognition" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 3: 33). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f74" href="#f74-text">74. </a>Woolf deems Austen "the most perfect artist among women" and arguably envisions herself as Austen's torchbearer (<span style="font-style:italic;">Common Reader</span>, 206). In a 1918 review, after all, Woolf writes that "the capacity to criticize the other sex had its share in deciding women to write novels, for indeed that particular vein of comedy has been but slightly worked, and promises great richness," a promise she seems to hold for herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Writers</span>, 26-7). One of the predictions she makes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, in fact, is that, should women have the resources to write, "comedy is bound to be enriched" . Although she rejected an invitation by the "the Womens Institute" to "write a play for the villagers to act. And to produce it myself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span>, 6: 391) while she was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, the novel itself functions as a kind of play suitable, in its feminist inclinations, for that institute.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f75" href="#f75-text">75. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 60) Woolf extends the essay's sentiments elsewhere when she claims that "humour, after all, is closely bound up with a sense of the body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Common Reader</span>, 57) and that "the book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that women's books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 78).</p></div>
