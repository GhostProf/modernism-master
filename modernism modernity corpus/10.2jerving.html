<p>
Before we get to this essay's main feature, let's start with the
cartoon. In July 1936, Warner Brothers released a lively Merrie Melodies
short directed by animator Fred "Tex" Avery called "I Love to Singa."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  It borrowed its title song from <i>The Singing Kid</i>, a recent
  full-length Warner vehicle for Al Jolson and Cab Calloway. But
  it borrowed plot and nearly everything else from <i>The Jazz
  Singer</i> . Alluding to this earlier, more celebrated Warner
  Brothers/Jolson teaming, the cartoon crystallized and replayed as
  farce the role that ethnic "novelty" once had played in shaping the
  language of American entertainment, particularly the language of jazz
  performers and jazz performance.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Like <i>The Jazz Singer</i> before it, "I Love to Singa" played
  commercial jazz as a New World form shot through with the accents of
  a transnational America, accents whose dissonance within the

<b></b>

imagined nation had troubled the would-be 100 percent Anglo-Saxonist
harmony of 1920s nativism. What's more, "I Love to Singa" sounded this
dissonance, not as something distinct from the commercial mainstream, but
as something inherent to it, a modernist effect generated and sustained
by the make-it-new imperative that drove the entertainment industry's
cycle of innovation&#8212;novelty&#8212;and planned obsolescence.

<p>
For the post-Great War decade, jazz had resonated as a style in which
transnational ethnicity and mass-mediated novelty could intersect to
unsettle standard ideas of American national identity and the language
through which it was being imagined. These connections could be quite
explicit in a pop song such as Frank Silver and Irving Cohn's Tin
Pan Alley jazz smash of 1923, "Yes! We Have No Bananas"; the frankly
commercial register worked by the song's vaudeville Greek linked
a novelty chorus to a counternativist vision in its verses&#8212;a
remaking of American business, language, and national identity in
New Immigrant accents to which I'll return (see <a name="1"
HREF="10.2jerving_res.html#1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  That same resonance served the literary work of a wide range of
  writers; I'll concern myself particularly with the early work of
  Samson Raphaelson, a writer of short stories, plays, ad copy, and
  screenplays. For Raphaelson, commercial jazz served as a powerful
  re and production model for a mass-directed, transnational
  "Americanese" challenging nativist harmony; first, in his story "The
  Day of Atonement"  and, later, in the stage version of <i>The
  Jazz Singer</i>  to which Raphaelson adapted it.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
And this brings us back to the dissonant sounds that structure the
economy of ethno-national identifications in "I Love to Singa." Inside
the eminently respectable-looking tree from which "Prof. Fritz Owl"
has hung his shingle&#8212;"Teacher of 'voice piano &amp; violin,'
but"&#8212;separate shingle&#8212;"NO JAZZ"&#8212;we find the good
Professor wearing out the carpet (literally, of course) waiting for
Mrs. Owl's brood to hatch. He taps each egg apprehensively; three
dutifully deliver a sweet bell tone, the fourth resounds with the
tinny crash of a jazz drummer's sock cymbal. What hatches confirms this
rather heavy-handed cymbalism. To the Professor's admiring estimation
emerge, in turn, a "Caruso" belting out an aria, a violin-playing
"Fritz Kreisler" and a flute-playing "Mendelssohn." But from that last
egg&#8212;oh!&#8212;steps a red-jacketed, blue-bow-tied, hand-clapping,
apparently already well-seasoned vaudevillian who salutes his parents with
a "Hello, Strenzer!" and goes into his dance singing the title tune. At
his first singing lesson in the next scene, the unwilling student intones
"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes" in the most nasal, sarcastic voice
he can muster, but interpolates enthusiastic, hushed snatches of "I
Love to Singa" into the breaks when his mother turns the pages of her
piano accompaniment. The song-a that this "Owl Jolson" loves to sing-a
is a parodic compendium of Tin Pan Alley clich&eacute;s and moon/June
rhymes about love, spring, blue skies, bluebirds, tea for two, the South,
mom, and the flag. Inevitably, the Professor walks in on his son getting
hot. "Enough is too much!" he bellows. Throwing his son out on his ear,
he sputters, "You hot-cha! You crooner! You falsetto! You jazz singer! You. . . You . . . You . . . Phooey!"

<p>
The scene, of course, echoes one in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> in which an
Old World father walks in on his son jazzing up "Blue Skies," meeting
the spectacle with a horrified bluster that drives the son into the open
arms of commercial entertainment, for good

<b></b>

maybe. The scene also invokes the ethnically inflected model of
generational conflict of the earlier film, a conceit almost overburdened
by the multiple fictive and metafictive levels at which it is reinforced:
in <i>The Jazz Singer,</i> a cantor's son named Jakie Rabinowitz chooses
not to follow in his Old World father's footsteps, instead Americanizing
his name and entering show biz as "Jack Robin"; Jack Robin is played by
a cantor's son

<b></b>

named Asa Yoelson who chose not to follow in his Old World father's
footsteps, instead Americanizing his name and entering show biz as
"Al Jolson"; Jolson sings a tune by a cantor's son named Israel Baline
who chose not to follow in his Old World father's footsteps, instead
Americanizing his name and entering show biz as "Irving Berlin." Even the
tune Owl Jolson sings was penned by a cantor's son named Hyman Arluck who
(you guessed it) chose not to follow in his Old World father's footsteps,
instead Americanizing his name and entering show biz as "Harold Arlen."

<p>
But the cartoon does not exactly follow through on the "set of
conventions for narratives about race and Oedipal conflict" that Krin
Gabbard has argued were inaugurated through <i>The Jazz Singer,</i>
narratives "in which the white hero transcends his ethnic background
through success as a popular entertainer imitating African Americans"
(<i>JM,</i> 37). In one of its details, the cartoon seems to do just
that: Owl Jolson's song links "a cheer for Uncle Sammy / With another
for my mammy," Americanization with minstrelsy. But his jazz voice never
"transcends" ethnicity, never asserts a national identity that whites out
intra-Euro-American distinctions by assuming a stance of shared racial
difference from (or identification with) blackness. His <i>salut au
monde</i>&#8212;"Hello, Strenzer!"&#8212;would have been recognizable as a
catchphrase used by Sam Hearn's Schlepperman on Jack Benny's nationally
popular radio show, a character whose stage Yiddishisms allowed the
show to indulge in an ethnicness that Benny downplayed in his own comic
persona. Deploying this greeting, Owl Jolson announces a break with Old
World (and trans-European) "seriousness" in order to pledge allegiance
to a mass-media aesthetic simultaneously American and ethnic. Indeed,
the lyric hook of his signature song is built around the same signifying
"ga" that, in novelist Anzia Yezierska's <i>Bread Givers</i>, marked
young Aby's continuing distance from a linguistic mainstream defined
by his teacher according to Anglo-Saxonist standards. In its vocal
cadences&#8212;sing-a/spring-a, moon-a/June-a&#8212;the song gently
parodied Al Jolson's way of singing&#8212;a style, as Gilbert Seldes
once observed, in which the perfunctory blackface mask Jolson adopted
"goes well with diversions in Yiddish accents."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  Seldes's observation was common in contemporary accounts of Jolson
  and other Jewish writers and performers such as Fanny Brice, Irving
  Berlin, or Sophie Tucker: a trope that red their success as due
  to, and not despite, their perceived difference within the imagined
  national community. Moreover, the trope red ethnic dissonance
  as part of entertainment's nation-defining role, its contribution to
  the gospel of novelty that made American mass culture what it was.

<p>
In response to his father's "Enough is too much," itself Yiddishized
English, Owl Jolson picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all
over again in direct, emphatic address to the camera&#8212;"That's mein
'pop.'" This three-word masterpiece of dialogic construction embodies the
cartoon's sense of a self-conscious, densely multivocal American style:
one that like Owl Jolson's signature song artfully, ludically combines
high with low, Old World with New, proper English with Damon Runyonesque
slang. As you might expect, the young entertainer's family eventually
learns to stop worrying and to love to sing-a too: for the final scene,
they even join the chorus line. That their hybridized utterance earns
a first prize on the "Jack Bunny" radio amateur hour places

<b></b>

"I Love to Singa" in the belated company of the feature presentation
to which I'll turn now: those early soundings of jazz that heard in the
music's commercial drive for novelty the potential for a transnational
style of sustained dissonance.

Americanese, If You Please

<p>
In <i>The Dialect of Modernism</i> , Michael North has noted
that writers from Joseph Conrad through Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot,
Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Jean Toomer, and Zora Neale
Hurston took on a "black" voice at key moments in the development of
modernism. North argues that "linguistic mimicry and racial masquerade
were not just shallow fads but strategies without which modernism could
not have arisen," black dialect&#8212;at least what was imagined to be
black dialect&#8212;a technical model for challenging standard ways of
putting black on white on the page.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  But while North clarifies this dialectic&#8212;illustrating
  particularly well the tangled position into which it put black
  modernists&#8212;he obscures the extent to which American modernism
  brought other ethnic, regional, occupational, and institutional uses
  of English into dialogic, oppositional, and revisionist play with
  shopworn standards.

<p>
This play was important because the nativist policing of language was
central to policing ideas of nation. The equation of language and loyalty
often was quite blunt:
the first sentence learned by Ford English School students was "I am a
good American." And in 1919 Congressional hearings for an Americanization
bill, Woodrow Wilson's Special Assistant Herbert Kaufman asserted,
"If a hundred million of us must stand together, we must think together,
and think without a foreign accent."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  In 1921, H. L. Mencken mused about the dithers into which the official
  institutions of American letters were likely to be thrown by a recent
  British embrace of the controversial (if now unknown) Welsh Irish
  American writer, Frank Harris: "One imagines the painful sensation in
  the <i>New York Times</i> office, the dismayed groups around far-flung
  campus pumps, the special meetings of the Princeton, N.J., and Urbana,
  Ill., American Legions, the secret conference between the National
  Institute of Arts and Letters and the Ku Klux Klan."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  The scenario paid specific tribute to several members of the American
  Academy (an upper chamber for the National Institute of Arts and
  Letters): editor John H. Finley of the <i>Times</i>, Henry Van Dyke at
  Princeton, and Stuart Sherman at the University of Illinois. Through
  his inimitable hyperbole&#8212;linking literary reputation brokers to
  the American Legion and the KKK&#8212;Mencken suggested how debates
  over American language and the literature that would exploit it were
  often framed in Romantic philology's racialist terms.

<p>
North shows both defenders and challengers of standards&#8212;both
those Mencken called "Anglomaniacs" and those Sherman called "literary
Mohawks"&#8212;buying into the Herderian assumption that "language is
the surest representation of a people to itself."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Thus debates over American literary language tapped deeper wells
  of debate over melting pots and miscegenation, reversion and
  restriction. If James Oppenheim could argue in the February 1920
  <i>Dial</i> that modernist poetry was "Our First National Art"
  precisely because it used "our American speech, the resultant of a
  new environment,

<b></b>

mixture of races and new experience," then Royal Cortissoz equally could
warn against the "Ellis Island Art"  such a mixture was likely to
produce. The prominent art critic wrote darkly that "the United States
is invaded by aliens, thousands of whom constitute so many acute perils
to the health of the body politic. Modernism is of precisely the same
heterogeneous alien origin and is imperilling the republic of art in
the same way."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
The same repulsed reaction to the language of othered ethnic
groups&#8212;or to difference itself coded as ethnically
other&#8212;fueled the writing of critic Stuart Sherman. Sherman,
the English department chair at the University of Illinois, was a
self-proclaimed antimodernist conservator of the "Puritan" spirit in
American letters after the war. Early 1920s immigration restrictionism
was paralleled in the fine distinctions Sherman drew around those
writers who might count as <i>Americans</i>  and around those
kinds of writing that could be assimilated into "The National Genius"
 or <i>The Genius of America</i> . In "The National Genius,"
Sherman argued through "a little series of neglected truisms" for an
inherent connection between aesthetic conformism and national worth: "An
artist is a man living in society. A great artist is a great man living
in a great society. When a great artist expresses himself completely,
it is found that he has expressed, not merely himself, but also the
dominant thought and feeling of the men with whom he lives."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  Given the apparent distributive property of greatness,
  Sherman's syllogism leads, logically, to the Eliotic
  conclusion&#8212;twenty-three years before "What Is a Classic?<br />
"&#8212;that to be a writer of national importance was to be "in a benign
conspiracy with one's time and place, and to be upborne by the central
stream of tendency" ("NG," 82). Sherman hinted that America's young
<i>intelligentsia</i> (the foreignness of the word was itself important)
were double agents within that conspiracy, succumbing to siren songs
"from beyond the borders of Anglo-Saxonia," songs devised by the "quick
Semitic intelligence" and sung in "super-subtle Italian fashion" ("NG,"
75, 78). Sherman thus troped the "tendency" of "National Genius" through
terms that, in their political register, conspired in anything-but-benign
ways against the inclusion of "Alpine" or "Mediterranean" (not to speak of
"Negroid" or "Mongolian") currents within the nation's "central stream."

<p>
Following the appearance of "The National Genius" in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, the then-liberal <i>New Republic</i> took Sherman to task for
"that particularist Americanism which in its essence requires exclusion,
ill-will, pride and prejudice&#8212;Anti-Semitism, Anti-Germanism,
Anti-Irishism, Anti-Russianism, Anti-everything else."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Sherman's biographers have argued this was an unfair characterization
  of his work. But their examples in his defense are not terribly
  convincing, and some&#8212;such as his protestations of nonhostility
  toward Jews in reply to charges brought by Ludwig Lewisohn&#8212;smack
  loudly of some-of-my-best-friends-ism plain and simple.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  But even if Sherman didn't have it in for any particular New
  Immigrants, he did not regard them in general as a force for good in
  rerouting the central stream of "Puritan" tendency. "I have really
  presented my notion of the way our non-'Anglo-Saxon' element is
  affecting and threatening to affect our literature," Sherman wrote
  in his cover letter to the <i>Atlantic Monthly;</i> "Of course I
  recognize, as I suppose everyone does, that there are innumerable non-Anglo-Saxons 
  
  <b></b>
  
  who are quite as fully in sympathy with our best
traditions as the natives. At the same time, I think it true that the
<i>spiritually</i> alien strain in our recent literature is largely
ascribable to the later importations of European blood and culture."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
There is, then, considerable irony to the fact that a key voice within
the counter-Anglo-Saxonist choir of the early 1920s belonged to one of
Sherman's some-of-my-best-friends friends, a former student named Sampson
(later "Samson") Raphaelson. On 14 April 1920, Raphaelson wrote Sherman
from Mill Valley, California, with news of having begun a story that
was to be "a study in contrast between the old Jewish cantor and his
son who is a black-face comedian and ragtime singer in musical comedy."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  The finished story would be purchased for $125 and published
  in <i>Everybody's Magazine</i> in January 1922 as "The Day of
  Atonement." Long after Raphaelson's graduation from the University
  of Illinois in 1917, Stuart Sherman would remain a mentor re for
  the younger writer. The two writers shared what seems to have been
  a genuine and mutual respect.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  But as the scion of a family of Russian Jewish immigrants to
  Manhattan's Lower East Side, Raphaelson would have been an example
  of that "later importation" of non-Anglo-Saxon European blood and
  culture so disruptive to Sherman's view of American literature's
  puritan tendency. And, as a careful reading of "The Day of Atonement"
  indicates, Sherman wasn't far wrong. Raphaelson was modest about the
  story's achievement, telling an interviewer in 1973 that "it wasn't
  a bad story, but it wasn't a particularly distinguished story. It's
  readable."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  But the story is important for its expression, both in narrative
  and in language, of a historically specific and "spiritually alien"
  vision of the national genius quite different from Sherman's.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
What All the Bums They Sing
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Raphaelson made central to "The Day of Atonement" the conceit that his
postwar jazz singer "was simply translating the age old music of the
cantors&#8212;that vast loneliness of a race wandering 'between two
worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born'&#8212;into primitive
and passionate Americanese" ("DA," 151). The cultural deadlock implied
by the (unattributed) Matthew Arnold quotation was engulfed within and
countered by the more hopeful trope of "translation"&#8212;of bringing
across. Raphaelson would recall having been struck by this conviction as
an undergraduate when he saw Al Jolson perform in <i>Robinson Crusoe,
Jr.,</i> on the show's 1917 stop in Champaign, Illinois. "My God," he
remembered saying to the woman beside him, "this isn't a jazz singer. This
is a cantor!"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  "The Day of Atonement" would plot this same intersection of jazz and
  Jewishness along the broad lines of Jolson's well-publicized tale
  of humble beginnings, his parents' expectation that he would be the
  next in a long line of cantors, and his choice instead to work as a
  popular entertainer.

<p>
But in contrast to the Jolson story, Raphaelson's tale saw his protagonist
ultimately honoring his father's wishes, achieving his own "day of
atonement" though missing his Broadway break to sing in his late father's
place for Yom Kippur services at the Hester Street Synagogue. By virtue
of this choice, "The Day of Atonement" might seem to be at heart just
another of many anti-jazz stories that would make their mark in the early

<b></b>

1920s, of a piece with Julian Street's "The Jazz Baby"  or
J. Hartley Manners's play <i>The National Anthem</i> .
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  To these cautionary tales&#8212;which indulged in <i>frisson-</i>filled
  flirtation with flaming jazz youth only, by narrative's end, to fold
  prodigal excess back into the waiting arms of family and continental
  Culture&#8212;"The Day of Atonement" might merely be seen to offer
  a novel non-WASP twist on the casting.

<p>
But to read "The Day of Atonement" as an anti-jazz fable neglects its
jazz singer's near seamless resuturing into the synagogue even as he
retains stylistic markers of vaudeville. If Jakie/Jack largely submits to
the procrustean demands of the "perfectly fitting suits of Anglo-Saxon
severity" in which the New World metonymically drapes him ("DA," 147),
Raphaelson's story finally insists that popular music represents not an
absolute break with the past so much as a smithy in which the created
conscience of a "primitive and passionate Americanese" might be forged
from the alloy of Old and New. This point is made through the story's
have-it-both-ways ending, which has Jack's agent phoning his business
partner from just outside the synagogue with the news that he'd just heard
"the greatest ragtime singer in America in the making" ("DA," 167).
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  But the point is established even from the story's opening sentences:
  a montage in which the novelty of Jakie/Jack's jazz is shown to make
  a new betwixt-and-between identity possible:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"What Jack Robin needs," said David Lee, who owns some of the whitest
of Broadway's white lights, "is a wife."
<p>

"What our Jakie needs," said Jack Robin's father, old Cantor Rabinowitz,
of the Hester Street Synagogue, "is a God."

<p>

"What I need," said Jack Robin, "is a song-number with a kick in it. The
junk that Tin Pan Alley is peddling these days is rusty&#8212;that's
all&#8212;<i>rusty</i>." ["DA," 147; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Owl Jolson, Jack is distinguished from his father by his talk. Yet
his snappy language&#8212;"kick," "junk," "rusty"&#8212;also distinguishes
him from David Lee, the manager who represents Anglo-Saxonist success (the
whitest of the white). Significantly, Jack declares a disidentification
with Tin Pan Alley's established product, troping it as last year's
model sadly in need of an antioxidizing shot of novelty. Indeed, Lee's
statement is syntactically identical to that of Yosele Rabinowitz, even
as it opposes its New World model of consensual relations ("a wife")
to the cantor's vision of a chosen people's descent ("a God").
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  That is to say, Jack Robin's language exceeds and supplants the
  standards offered by either his father or his manager, the choice
  between an Eastern European Yiddishkayt and U. S. Americanization.

<p>
Rejecting both standards, Jack, like Owl Jolson, instead pledges
allegiance to the flag of "kick": a modernist, un-"rusty" stance not
because it utterly abandons Old to cleave to New, but because like
Eliot's Sanskrit texts or H. D.'s Hellenism or Picasso's African masks,
it shapes a new setting for some very old stones:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Those dark eyes of his might have been the ecstatic eyes of a poet in the
days when the Chosen People lived sedately in the land of Canaan. They
might have been prophetic eyes, stern and stirring, in the years of
Zedekiah, son of Josiah, King of Judah, when Jerusalem "knew not its
God." They might have been deep wells of lamentation even one generation
ago had his lyric voice been born to cry the sorrows of Israel in a
Russian synagogue. ["DA," 147]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Jack's seeming vaudeville carelessness is betrayed by "dark eyes"
and a "lyric voice" that reveal a lurking "Russian kind of morbidness"
(Russian "soul" being an alternately euphemistic and metonymic re
in contemporary explanations of Jewish stage performers and jazz
writers like Jolson, Brice, Berlin, or Gershwin), a "sentimental
grief" that finds him at eighteen "howling dolefully the strains of
'Down by the Old Mill Stream'" and eased of the "ache of happiness"
by the "plaintive blare of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.'" "How could the
old cantor," asks the narrator, making the point painfully explicit,
"or for that matter, Jakie himself, understand that instead of being
sinful and self-indulgent, loose and lazy, this grave-eyed boy with
the ways of the street was sincerely carrying on that tragic tradition
disguised ironically with the gay trappings of Broadway and the rich
vulgarity of the East Side?" ("DA," 151).

<p>
The story gives this generalized "Russian" morbidity specific
musical import through its nearly identical descriptions of Jack's
religious and vaudeville performance style. The "caressing quavers"
and "lilting plaintiveness" ("DA," 151, 154) of Jack's ragtime voice
find their parallel in his story-ending rendition of the "Kol Nidre"
"rising from a low sing-song into a quivering, majestic wail and then
breaking into incoherent plaintiveness" ("DA," 165). And in his first
dance with Amy Prentiss, Jack takes his cue from a violin's "slim
pattern of simple melody, which was being tortured into savage bedlam
by the bulletlike spitting of the drum and by the saxophone's gusts of
passionate whining." Jack "seemed, somehow, to make of the simple steps
a wild, heart-breaking aria, a mad pounding on the doors of heaven"
("DA," 157). This doubleness in Jack/Jakie's performance identity belies
Yosele's absolutist lament that he has "no son at all" ("DA," 151).

<p>
Though the story doubted that Jakie himself had this understanding, the
play made him accomplice to its demonstration, a conscious dramaturge
staging the link between jazz singing and Jewishness. <i>The Jazz
Singer</i> opened on 15 September 1925 at Broadway's Fulton Theatre
and ran for more than three hundred performances with vaudevillian
George Jessel in the lead (Jessel was also originally slated for the
movie). The years spanned by "The Day of Atonement" were telescoped into
two twenty-four-hour homecomings separated by a month. Jack's return
found him attempting to reconcile his two worlds for his parents through
his music, as he lined out the resemblance between a Hebrew prayer tune,
"Ain Kelohenu," and a popular song:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Nothing ever hurries me, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing ever worries me,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Easy come,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Easy go,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's all the same to me!"
<br />
I just got them mixed, Papa&#8212;See? [<i>JS,</i> 51]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The script directed both to be sung "to exactly the same tune and with
exactly the same plaintiveness but with a new rhythm and shaking his
shoulders. . . . This does not have quite the effect which Jack innocently
had hoped for." Nor does Jack's commentary: "Where did I learn to sing
like that? From Papa&#8212;who else? . . . If he were born here, like I
was, he would probably be singing jazz, too" (<i>JS,</i> 51-2). Jack's
efforts may

<b></b>

meet with the same horror that met Owl Jolson a decade later, but they
present possibilities for translating Old World "plaintiveness" into
New World "rhythm."

<p>
Moreover, Jakie/Jack succeeds aesthetically, as both a vaudevillian
and a cantor, not despite, but due to this doubleness and the novelty
it represents. "Chee, but that baby can rag!" said Jakie's first
East Side audiences "as they swayed, hypnotized, to the caressing
quavers of his voice" ("DA," 151). After their dance, Amy tells Jack,
"You dance differently from any one I know" ("DA," 157). Having found
the same quality of difference in his singing, she asks (anticipating
David Lee's conclusion), "Hasn't anybody let you in on the secret that
you're one of the few real rag-singers in America?" ("DA," 156). And the
congregation for his synagogue performance hears Jack sing "with a high
broken sobbing which, they insisted critically, surpassed his father's in
his best days. . . . he sang the grief-laden notes with a lyric passion
that was distinctly his own" ("DA," 165). Those vestiges of difference,
and their translation into the unlikely settings of movie palaces,
vaudeville houses, and back in their roundabout way into the synagogue
made Jack "no ordinary singer of ragtime," and no ordinary cantor either.

<p>
And it is difference itself, rather than any particular ethnic form
it takes, that makes Jack Robin a New World, un-"rusty" performer:
jazz style in "The Day of Atonement" is less an essentialized Jewish
temperament than a historically specific matter of one immigrant
other's dissonant ethnic relation to what Stuart Sherman had called the
"central stream of tendency." The story has its moments in which this
difference is essentialized, and this would be still truer of the play
and film (I'll return to this idea later in the essay). But with greater
regularity, Raphaelson sounded jazz and ethnicity as things unsettling
to identity&#8212;particularly the identity of any too-easy national
harmony. Jakie hears jazz in the "dissonant rumble of response from the
congregation, the restive shufflings of youngsters" in the synagogue
("DA," 155). In his preface to the stage <i>Jazz Singer</i>, Raphaelson
would re jazz as a synecdoche for the "vivid contrast of surfaces"
in American life and the "vital chaos of America's soul," and its jazz
singer through a "vision of cathedrals and temples collapsing and,
silhouetted against the setting sun, a solitary re, a lost soul,
dancing grotesquely on the ruins" (<i>JS,</i> 22). If there was anything
especially "Jewish" to jazz dissonance as Raphaelson red it, it
seems to have rested upon the ur-immigrant position occupied by the Jew
in this writer's economy of difference, and particularly in the trope of
"wandering" to which he repeatedly turned. (Like the story, Raphaelson's
preface to the play would invoke Arnold's re of a race lost "between
two worlds" ["DA," 151; <i>JS,</i> 10].)

<p>
Raphaelson emphasized the uncanny homelessness of this jazz
ethnicity&#8212;the performance of relational novelty that it
encouraged&#8212;by tracing Jack's talent repeatedly back to an
indefinable, unspeakably amorphous "it"-ness. When Jakie sings in an
East Side movie house, his audience "instinctively . . . responded to it"
("DA," 151). When Jack wishes he could dance "standing straight and moving
sort of&#8212;well, evenly and correctly," Amy Prentiss tells him, "I'm
crazy about the way you dance. . . . I've been crazy about the very thing
in you that you're deprecating. I wish I had it. I'd give <i>anything</i>
to have it. It&#8212;it hurt me a lot to find your performance to-day
lacking in it" ("DA," 158; italics in original). David Lee tells him,
"I don't know what it is, but you

<b></b>

have the <i>capacity</i> to get it. I've seen it show suddenly in talented
performers, sometimes overnight" ("DA," 162; italics in original). And in
the play, when Jack asks a reporter, rhetorically: "What has the story of
my life got to do with the way I put over a jazz song?" his love interest
(named Mary Dale in the play) answers, "Everything, Jack. . . . It's
a new note" (<i>JS</i>, 79). Ann Douglas describes the 1920s use of
"it" (as with "It Girl" Clara Bow) as "a pop version of Freud's id,
an undefinable voltage of openly sexual energy."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  But Raphaelson's jazz narratives suggest that the charge of "it" also
  derived, in part, from the challenge that culture industry novelty
  presented to settled categories of ethnicity and nation. "It" would
  be the new note behind the "primitive and passionate Americanese"
  that Raphaelson's jazz tales promised.

<p>
Raphaelson's sounding of jazz might be heard in more general terms, its
nation-revising model of ethnic novelty mapping out a strategy for other
sorts of culture industry workers&#8212;including writers of magazine
stories and Broadway plays. Indeed, a Jack Robinesque doubleness of ethnic
style is much in evidence in Raphaelson's own writing, and particularly
in his multiple, novel allegiances to Standard English, Yiddish, and the
hybrid vernacular that made up Hester Street's "richly filthy East Side
argot" ("DA," 148). Yiddish not only appears in his use of particular
vocabulary and phrases (whose italicization flags their foreignness),
but also in much of the English that is refracted through recognizably
Yiddish syntax. "Bum!" Yosele Rabinowitz excoriates Jakie, "In a synagogue
you don't even put your head." "Maybe," he tells his wife, "maybe when he
gets older, he'll see how beautiful is <i>Yiddishkeit</i>. Maybe he would
stop hanging around music-places and singing these ragstime [<i>sic</i>]
songs what all the bums they sing" ("DA," 150; italics in original). And
he finally laments, "Better I shouldn't have it no son at all" ("DA,"
151). (By the time Laurence Olivier would get his chops around this line
for the 1980 Neil Diamond remake of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, his lament
would be boiled down to a simple, Standard "I have no son.")
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Both Raphaelson's Standard and his Yiddishized English were further cut
with the novelty of East Side slang and its connection to entertainment
world jargon. His use of this "richly filthy" argot&#8212;"kick," "rusty"
("DA," 147), "yeller," "shiner" ("DA," 148), "baby," "rag" ("DA," 151),
"kiddo," "wallop," "skirt," "bunk" ("DA," 152)&#8212;allowed him to
posit the essence of "Americanese" in its lack of essence: modern Hester
Street's doubly disidentified and culturally hybrid avoidance of all
things "rusty." Near its end, the story sounds a note demonstrating just
this sense of language in flux. Jack's final performance&#8212;singing the
"Kol Nidre" and the Kaddish with his jazz-inflected style&#8212;seems
to inspire in its auditors a vortical image of how a hybrid, shifting
Americanese might look, sound, and feel: "Beat it! Go home bums,
loafers! Ain't you got no respect for the <i>Chazon</i>? G'wan! Can't you
leave some peace be even on Yom Kippur. <i>Paskudniks</i>!" ("DA," 166;
italics in original). As the collective voice of the Lower East Side
rises, it does so in a dissonant, modernist montage of sacred Hebrew
("Yom Kippur"), Yiddish invective ("Paskudniks"), Yiddishized English
vernacular ("Go home bums, loafers"), and Hester Street slang ("Beat it,"
"G'wan"). An East Side kid himself, Raphaelson could present himself thus
as a conductor of this modernist dissonance: like Jakie/Jack, a re
"dancing grotesquely on the ruins" of a putatively

<b></b>

premodern purity and stability, provisionally orchestrating these
fragments of language and style into something novel&#8212;"It's a
new note."

<p>
Americanization proponents may have worked to elide exactly those
notes signifying their subjects' ethnic particularity or hyphenated
hybridity&#8212;the way English teacher Sara Smolinsky worked to
elide the signifying "ga" of Aby's speech in Yezierska's <i>Bread
Givers</i>. Indeed, Stuart Sherman seems to have hoped his student
would come around in much the same way. While he encouraged Raphaelson
to mine his heritage, Sherman was less than comfortable with the
Owl Jolsonesque mixed forms that Jewishness seemed to be taking in
Raphaelson's representation of ethnicity under New World consumer-society
modernity. Sherman wrote Raphaelson:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When you really plumb the depths of that great Jewish tradition which
you have only dipped your fingers in, you will certainly find yourself
more in sympathy with what a gentile might call its Miltonic elements;
and you will interest yourself for the modern equivalents of them, and,
I suspect, won't be quite satisfied with your singer's rag-time as the
full modern equivalent for the old Hebrew chants.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But Raphaelson's work insisted that Jack Robin's "rag-time" was important
not because of its essential cultural difference from nor its identity
with the Anglo-Saxon strain of American culture. Rather, jazz resonated
for Jack and his audience through its novel drive toward a transnational
double consciousness that Raphaelson portrayed as central to a particular
moment's cultural response to urbanizing, corporatizing American life:
the betwixt-bothered-and-bewildered modernism of those newest kids on the
block, uniquely positioned to choreograph an allegory of this particular
modernity's ruins.

<p>
The ethnicized innovations of a Jack Robin or a Samson Raphaelson depended
on their mass dissemination for whatever cultural effect they were to have
on the imagined national community and its language. Indeed, their novel
Americanese threatened Standard operating proceduralists precisely to the
degree that it might be iterated and reiterated indefinitely through the
developing entertainment industries. Jack's new note was broadcast far
beyond Hester Street over a national vaudeville circuit that brought him,
over the course of "The Day of Atonement," to Atlantic City, Buffalo,
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, New Haven, New Orleans, New York, Salt Lake
City, San Antonio, San Diego, and San Francisco. When Hamlin Garland
took up the matter

<b></b>

of the American Academy's newly established Medal for Good Diction on the
Stage, he suggested enlarging the scope of the award to cover emergent
mass-media forms such as radio, through which "minor errors in speech"
were being multiplied "into major offenses against society."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  According to Neil Leonard, commercial jazz predominated within the
  music that itself constituted three-fourths of all radio programming in
  the 1920s; such a predominance had been behind <i>Etude</i> magazine's
  1924 adjuration to "'Listen in' on the radio any night. Tap America
  anywhere in the air and nine times out of ten Jazz will burst forth."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Jazz&#8212;disseminated through vaudeville, radio, recordings, piano
  rolls, movie house orchestras, movie scores, and sheet music&#8212;was
  not only a metaphoric model for what the Academy feared, but also a
  wide-ranging bearer of it.

<p>
These entertainment industries and their jazz rewarded ethnic diversions,
so long as they could be marketed as novel turns in the cycle of
planned aesthetic obsolescence. Tin Pan Alley&#8212;so dubbed in 1909
by journalist Monroe Rosenfeld as he took note of the cacophony of
Manhattan's songwriting district on West Twenty-eighth Street between
Fifth Avenue and Broadway&#8212;worked all sorts of variations on Jack
Robin's new note, teaching audiences to sing-a in Yiddish, Irish,
Hawaiian, African American and other accents, through songs such as
"That's Yiddisha Love" , "Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, That's an Irish
Lullaby" , "Oh! How She Could Yacki, Hacki, Wicki, Wicki, Wacki,
Woo" , and "(Lena is the Queen of) Palesteena." The more mixed
the mix, the better&#8212;witness "Yonkle the Cow-Boy Jew" ,
"I've Got Rings on My Fingers (Mumbo Jumbo Jijjiboo J. O'Shea)," "Yiddle
on Your Fiddle Play Some Ragtime" , "Yiddisher Irish Baby" ,
"Rosie Rosenblatt, Stop Your Turkey Trot," "Since Maggie Dooley Learned
the Hooley Hooley" , "Yiddishe Blues" , "That's Yiddisha
Jazz" , and "Yiddisha Charleston" . Richard K. Spottswood's
seven-volume discography of ethnic recordings&#8212;which were aimed,
like similarly niche-marketed "race" or "hillbilly" catalogues, at
subnational groups&#8212;further attests to a culture industry willing
to recognize and perpetuate a transnational America. The Great War had
given the ethnic record industry an invaluable boost as it cut off the
production and supply of recordings from overseas and "as immigrants
from war-torn countries sought material that reinforced their cultural
ties in America and reassured them that all was not lost at home."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  All told, the ethnic, linguistic dissonance generated by popular song's
  make-it-obsolete imperative presented a significant and persistent
  challenge to those who would have imagined the United States as a
  homogenously Americanized, 100 percent Anglo-Saxonized nation.

<p>
It's pretty to think so, anyway. But if dissonance was generated
through the contradictions inherent in Culture, Inc.'s business cycles,
it was also consistently contained and harmonized, the minor threat
of any particular novelty generally rendered harmless by pop's uncanny
ability to eat itself. For proof, we need only consider the fate of that
greatest of all ethnolinguistic sallies from the Alley: "Yes! We Have No
Bananas." This immense "jazz" hit began life in 1923 as a mild ethnic
joke, and in its optimistic take on ethnic dissonance, it acted as the
virtual obverse of the Anglo-Saxonist center-cannot-hold modernism of
contemporary High Art productions such as <i>The Waste</i>

<b></b>

<i>Land</i> .
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  In contrast to T. S. Eliot's poem&#8212;though, like it, marking
  time during a national political movement toward immigration
  restriction&#8212;"Bananas" sounded global production and consumption,
  the urban concentration of an ethnically diverse population, the
  Fordizing of entertainment, and other hallmarks of American modernity
  as opportunities for linguistic and national reinvention. Yet even in
  its own day, the link between "Bananas" and debates over ethnicity was
  being forgotten. Performances of the song, such as Paul Whiteman's
  use of it at his celebrated 1924 "Experiment in Modern Music" at
  Manhattan's Aeolian Hall, came to focus on the chorus's harmless
  patchwork of nonsense rather than on the ethnicized social context
  explicit in the song's verses.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  "Bananas" has since been remembered largely as the epitome of pop
  dada, the "all-time top in the school of musical nonsense," as Sigmund
  Spaeth put it in his 1948 <i>History of Popular Music in America,</i>
  rather than as a clarion call to lift immigration restrictions so
  that American English might continually be remade in the accents of
  its non-Nordic transplants (to use the racialist parlance by which
  the older, northern European immigrants were distinguished from the
  newer Mediterranean or Alpine models).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
As a pop phenomenon, "Yes! We Have No Bananas" stands in that crowded
line of fleeting 1920s crazes&#8212;beauty contests, Mah-Jongg, Emil
Cou&eacute;, crossword puzzles, King Tut&#8212;that defined "America
Convalescent" for contemporary historian Frederick Lewis Allen. In <i>Only
Yesterday</i> , Allen reported that the song and its catchphrase
"penetrated to the remotest farmhouse in the remotest county": it was the
"I've fallen and I can't get up," the "who let the dogs out" of its day.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  The emphasis on raw sonic materiality in the song's chorus also
  placed it within Tin Pan Alley's fad nonsense tradition along with
  "Hitchy-Koo" , "Snooky Ookums" , "The Aba Daba Honeymoon"
  , "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble" , and "Heebie Jeebies" (1925,
  the song for which Louis Armstrong "invented" scat singing). In both
  lyric and melodic construction, "Bananas" could well serve as the
  technical model for a poetics of modernist mass-cultural montage,
  particularly in the concatenation of vegetation featured in the song's
  chorus and filtered through some rather breathtaking experiments in
  syntax, orthography, typography, and performance cues:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
YES! we have no bananas; we have no bananas today.
<br />
We've string beans, and HON-ions,
<br />
Ca-BAH-ges, and scallions,
<br />

<br />
We have an old fashioned to-MAH-to,
<br />
Long Island po-TAH-to
<br />
But, YES! we have no bananas; we have no bananas today.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
["Y!" lines 9-15]
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The story behind the music also provided a model instance of mass
culture's collective, anonymous, even cynical division of labor. Famously,
the chorus pilfered and patched together well-known tunes from a range of
classical, folk, operatic, and Tin Pan Alley registers: the "Hallelujah"
chorus from George Handel's <i>Messiah</i> ,

<b></b>

the traditional Scottish air "My Bonnie," Michael Balfe and Alfred Bunn's
"I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls" from the opera <i>The Bohemian Girl</i>
, and (borrowing a phrase itself recently pilfered for Cole Porter's
"Old-Fashioned Garden" [1919]), a popular American song from the 1860s,
"When I Saw Sweet Nellie Home" (also known as "Aunt Dinah's Quilting
Party"). To guard against plagiarism charges, the writers checked the
song with Porter's publisher Max Dreyfus. Dreyfus changed the direction
of one note and gave it his okay.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  The hands pulling together these strands were several as well. The song
  was written originally by one-hit wonders Frank Silver and Irving Cohn,
  and performed at Long Island roadhouses and New York restaurants to
  apparently indifferent response by Frank Silver's Music Masters. It was
  rejected by Waterson, Berlin, and Snyder (Irving Berlin's publishing
  house), but was picked up by selling agents Shapiro, Bernstein,
  and Company. By the time they were through with it, staff writers
  Elliott Shapiro, Jimmy Hanley, Lew Brown, and Ballard MacDonald each
  had contributed lines. Sales were sleepy until vaudeville star Eddie
  Cantor interpolated the song into <i>Make It Snappy!</i> to provide
  extra material for the revue's Philadelphia run. The audience demanded
  multiple encores, and when Cantor recorded the song for Victor it
  began to achieve what Henry Osgood would call its "insane" popularity.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
To guess at the reasons, one could point to its faddish ludic
lyric materiality and its prodigal use of time-tested melodies
(as well as some plugging by a major star). But beyond this, one
might consider also the song's celebration of American "pep" in the
face of modernity's challenges. Like much professionally produced,
mass-consumed entertainment, "Yes! We Have No Bananas" presented a
utopian world of possibilities, lyrically and musically: a structure
of feeling that offered what Richard Dyer has termed "temporary answers
to the inadequacies of the society which is being escaped from through
entertainment."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The song answered unequal wealth distribution with the spectacle of
  abundance: no bananas, to be sure, but "all kinds" of other fruits
  and vegetables, and a vast storehouse of musical motifs readily
  available for consumption; even the song's self-conscious novelty
  displayed faith in a future of similarly ephemeral pop hits. It
  countered alienated labor's exhaustion and dreariness with manic
  vaudeville energy (speed, rhythm, punch) and performative intensity
  (vivid accents, exclamations). It defused suspicions of political and
  commercial manipulation by offering a case of Tin Pan Alley plagiarism
  whose operation was plainly, playfully transparent. And through the
  similarly transparent bait and switch of the song's fruit-selling
  protagonist, the song dismissed the anatomized, antagonistic relations
  of individuals under the system of commodity exchange, giving a
  knowing wink that invoked a knowing "we."

<p>
Yet Dyer also reminds us that if entertainment's utopianism responds to
real, felt inadequacies, it addresses "only those gaps or inadequacies
that capitalism proposes itself to deal with."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  More systemic lacks are left out of the picture: persistent economic
  disparity, structural racism, patriarchal relations. Even at the
  time, the song's prophylactic ideological function was noted
  by J. W. T. Mason, a New York correspondent for the <i>London
  Daily Express:</i> "Cardboard imitations of bunches of bananas
  are making their appearance bearing the legend, 'Yes; we have no
  bananas.' Business men

<b></b>

hang these ornaments in their offices, as a reminder that, after all,
there must be a way out of every difficulty."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Where <i>The Waste Land</i> dug up only "dried tubers" (<i>WL,</i>
  line 7), the vegetation ceremonies of "Bananas" promised to keep
  its listeners supplied up to their cauliflower ears in "Long Island
  po-TAH-toes," in the process diverting more basic questions about
  postwar displacement, alienation, and lack. Yes! We have no water
  under this red rock; but just look at that Eddie Cantor go!

<p>
It is perhaps for this reason that the Baroness Else von
Freytag-Loringhoven&#8212;dadaist poet, sculptor, and self-proclaimed
aesthetic "aristocrat"
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 &#8212; approached "Yes! We Have No Bananas" with a good deal of
 irony. In "A Dozen Cocktails &#8212; Please" (undated, but most likely
 from 1923) she wrote:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
No spinsterlollypop for me &#8212; yes &#8212; we have
<br />
No bananas &#8212; I got lusting palate &#8212; I
<br />
Always eat them &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;
<br />

<br />
Tinted diabolically as a baboon's hind-complexion.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What followed mimicked the material, nonrepresentational formal abundance
of ad-speak, popular song, and the sweep of a radio dial. Through its
sound and fury, "A Dozen Cocktails" proposed that high modernism was being
out-Joyced, out-Moored, and out-Pounded by the radical collage offered
every day in mass circulation magazines and over the airwaves. Yet the
poem maintained a careful distance from the kind of nation that could be
imagined through mass forms. Near its end, it cuts to what sounds like
a conversation among ad moguls discussing how best to get poets to do
their dirty work:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
How are we going to put it befitting
<br />
Lifted upsys?
<br />
Psh! Any sissy poet has sufficient freezing
<br />
Chemicals in his Freudian icechest to snuff all
<br />
Cockiness. We'll hire one.
<br />
Hell! Not that! That's the trouble &#8212; &#8212;
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"Sissy poets" as trouble: wishful thinking? Maybe. But her scenario
presented the dilemma of an avant-garde whose best new approaches for
probing surfaces (analytical collage) and depths (psychoanalysis) had
already been pressed into the service of profit.

<p>
Yet if the "Bananas" chorus could get kicked around as the very model
of entertainment at work, its ludic utopianism addressing only what
was already deliverable under the status quo, the song's verses suggest
another angle entirely. Indeed, the utopianism of "Bananas" might be said
to face the facts of modernity's shifting margins and cultural centers
more squarely than the "futile gestures" and "cynical resignation" that
for Matthew Josephson (reviewing <i>The Waste Land</i> for <i>Broom</i>
in January 1923) marked a diversionary dystopian strain within modernism.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  This dystopianism could slip rather easily into simple
  scapegoating&#8212;see Eliot's vague allusions to Eastern Europe's
  "hooded

<b></b>

hordes" (<i>WL,</i> line 369). In contrast, "Bananas" brought front
and center an ethnic type marked for marginalization under developing
national policy:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
There's a fruit store on our street,
<br />
It's run by a Greek.
<br />
And he keeps good things to eat
<br />
But you should hear him speak.
<br />
When you ask him anything,
<br />
Never answers "no";
<br />
He just "yes-es" you to death
<br />
And as he takes your dough he tells you:
<br />
YES! we have no bananas . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
["Y!" lines 1-9]
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>



<p>
In the latter part of 1923, vaudeville star Belle Baker's "I've Got
the 'Yes! We Have No Bananas' Blues" kept this ethnic dimension of the
original in plain view:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Day by day, week by week
<br />
It's "Yes! We have no bananas."
<br />
Everytime that Greek meets Greek
<br />
It's "Yes! We gotta no bananas."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider the irony of the song's "insane" popularity&#8212;enough to
justify an exasperated answer song&#8212;in light of a political climate
busy engendering the legal, congressionally endorsed restriction on the
impact that Southern and Eastern European immigration might have on the
American nation and language.

<p>
This so-called New Immigration&#8212;which included Jews, Italians,
Greeks, Arabs, and Slavs, among other Southern and Eastern European
national and ethnic groups&#8212;had been characterized by its opponents
through its supposed social, biological, and especially linguistic
unassimilability. Between the 1880s and World War I, one-fifth to
one-quarter of the work force of Greece had, indeed, set their backs
to Athens and other places, joining the many Greeks (and Armenians and
Syrians) then leaving Asia Minor during the final troubled decades of
the Ottoman Empire. The majority went to the United States, New York in
particular, where many did, in fact, work as fruit peddlers and small
greengrocers. In a manner typical of the othering tropes to which Greeks
and other New Immigrants were subject, this development would be cited
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1908 as evidence of immigration having
"even tapped the political sinks of Europe."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  The immigration predominant since the 1890s had brought vast numbers
  of people "shut out from the great common medium of expression,"
  as the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> put it in April 1919, "for whom
  a President's proclamation or a village ordinance is so much Greek,
  whom the flux of events and opinions that shapes national life can
  not reach except indirectly or second hand."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
As if in direct answer to this persistent charge of unassimilability,
"Yes! We Have No Bananas" featured a Greek storekeeper who had no trouble
at all&#8212;well, just "fun" trouble&#8212;integrating into the life of
"our street." Indeed, the extra choruses included

<b></b>

in later printings of the song's 1923 run suggested that this storekeeper
had succeeded all too well in incorporating a recognizably American
mix of small-time grift and public relations chutzpah: "We'll sell
you some Swiss cheese, / When you open up this cheese / It gets up and
walks away" (lines 32-4). But what's more, and what's interesting, the
song insisted that his economic integration was not predicated upon any
wholesale assimilation to Anglo-Saxonist standards. Indeed, his novel,
ethnically accented rewriting of American English was rendered as both
the point of the sale and, in fact, the point of the song. As a review
of <a href="10.2jerving_res.html#1">re 1</a> shows, this
linguistic dissonance had its visual counterpart in the cover art to the
sheet music sold by Shapiro, Bernstein, and Company, art that played
up the storekeeper's stereotypically "ethnic" dress, facial features,
and gestures.

<p>
And, to quote Jolson, you ain't heard nothin' yet. By its second verse,
the song was working overtime to extend its commercial, aesthetic,
and transnational opportunities to untold others:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Bus'ness got so good with him
<br />
He wrote home to say,
<br />
"Send me Pete and Nick and Jim,
<br />
I need help right away."
<br />
When he got them in the store
<br />
There was fun, you bet.
<br />
Someone asked for "Sparrow-grass,"
<br />
And then the whole quartette all answered:
<br />
YES! we have no bananas . . .

<p>
Let's do the math here. The first percentage-based quota law in the United
States was passed in May 1921. Sponsored in the House by Republican Albert
Johnson (the anti-Wobbly, anti-Japanese representative from Washington),
it set the number of admissible immigrants at 3 percent of those counted
as foreign-born residents from any given nation in the 1910 census. If
the logic of this formula escapes you, don't be surprised: the numbers
and dates were rigged to discriminate specifically against the New
Immigration. Because the bill did not discriminate well enough (from the
100 percenter's standpoint), David A. Reed, a Republican Senator from
Pennsylvania, pushed for a revision of the act that reset the quota to
2 percent of all Americans who presently claimed origin from any given
nation. Because res for national origins were not yet available in
1924, the act actually signed into law red quotas based on the number
of foreign-born residents as counted in the 1890 census. As John Higham
reports, this meant cutting the Italian quota from 42,000 to about 4,000,
the Polish from 31,000 to 6,000 . . .

<p>. . . And the Greek from 3,000 to 100.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  All by their lonesomes, Pete, Nick, and Jim would have constituted
  a full 3 percent of the Greek total officially admissible for 1924.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  Now compare these res to the new math of "Bananas." As legislation
  was making its way into law that would reduce Greek immigration by
  a factor of thirty,

<b></b>

"Yes! We Have No Bananas" proposed instead to increase&#8212;indeed, to
quadruple&#8212;the number of Greeks doing business on "our street." And
the song made this pitch on the premise that the immigrant remaking of
the nation and its language&#8212;"so much Greek"&#8212;would be "fun,
you bet!" The last extra chorus admits that "This song isn't pretty, /
But still it's a ditty, / That grows on you day by day," and enjoins a
national community to come together thus:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And you can all do something for us
<br />
Just join in the chorus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Spoken) <i>All together!</i>
<br />
YES! we have no bananas; we have no bananas today.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
["Y!" lines 74-80]
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, in the midst of Higham's "Tribal Twenties," "Yes! We Have No
Bananas" countered an Anglo-Saxonist nativism with a utopian vision
(and sound) of how things might be otherwise, politically as well as at
the point of purchase.

<p>
It's not hard to imagine how this narrative of integration and
transnational revision might appeal to Frank Silver, Irving Cohn,
or Eddie Cantor, all Jews whose future immigration was likewise
targeted by the Johnson-Reed Immigration Restriction Act. So it is not
surprising that the song exhibited crossover appeal in recordings aimed
at other New Immigrant markets. In July 1923, according to Richard
Spottswood's <i>Ethnic Music</i> discography, an Italian version of
"Bananas" (attributed to E. Migliaccio and Irving Cohan [<i>sic</i>])
was recorded as the flip side to "O Ritorno A 'O Paese (Returning to
the Home Town)." Two versions were recorded for Columbia on the same
date in Yiddish: as "Ye Ch'ob Nit Kein Panenis" by Gus Goldstein and as
"Yes! Mir Hobn Keyn Banenez" by Goldstein with Clara Gold. The Goldstein
and Gold recording emphasized intra-immigrant, and even intra-Yiddishe
novelty, featuring choruses variously rendered in Litvak, Galitzianer,
and Italian dialects. The Belle Baker answer song from the same year,
"I've Got the 'Yes! We Have No Bananas' Blues," produced its own ethnic
catalog equivalent: "Gevalt! Di Banenez" (Yikes! The Bananas), written
by Joseph Tanzman and recorded by David Medoff, in which an exasperated
narrator ducks into a synagogue to escape the ubiquitous tune but finds
it being sung by the cantor as well.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  The "Bananas" phenomenon, thus, might be heard to function as a
  cross-New Immigrant reaction to the nativism behind the push for
  restriction, and also to those aspects of the Americanization movement
  that were calling for ethnic assimilation or "refinement."

<p>
The song's wide cross-ethnic appeal might even be heard as a broader
rejection of the antimodern strategies by which nativism proposed
to meet the facts of a globalizing economy and the ethnic hybridity
of urbanization. Certainly contemporary attempts to account for its
popularity framed it within what Werner Sollors calls a "universal
regeneration" model of the melting pot, in which new streams of
immigration were held to be a necessary reminder of what it meant to be
"American."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Even though "TAD" Dorgan's cartoons were known to be the source of
  the song's title, many accounts nevertheless took the verse lyrics
  at their word, attributing the phrase to vendors

<b></b>

of varying immigrant identities. (In one version, the vendor was not an
immigrant at all, but a fruit seller in Manila encountered by soldiers
in the Spanish-American War who brought the line back with them to San
Francisco.) Mason's report for the <i>London Daily Express</i> linked
the catchphrase to a range of New Immigrant groups:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The phrase originated in the fruit shops kept in New York by Greeks,
Italians, and Jews, whose knowledge of the English language is limited
in verbiage, but not in volubility, nor in willingness to try.
<p>
These ancient races come to the New World for profit, and never like
to turn a customer away. So they have evolved a curious positive and
negative for the same sentence. Why the slangmakers hit on bananas has
not been discovered. It might as well have been any other commodity.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Mason concluded, "The phrase is a tribute to the optimism of the newly
arrived immigrant; to his earnest t to master the language of his
temporary country, and so, somehow, is supposed to take on the American
characteristic of 'getting there,' even though by way of an affirmative
in a negative sentence."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  Like the song, Mason saw opportunities in immigration for regenerating
  American English. "New York slang usually changes monthly," he
  wrote. "Of late there has been a falling off in inspiration, and
  picturesque argot culled from the city's polyglot interminglings has
  fallen sadly behind New York's quick-witted reputation" (<i>SLA,</i>
  367). "Yes! We Have No Bananas"&#8212;picturesque, polyglot, and
  quick-witted&#8212;offered evidence that commercial jazz, inescapably
  implicated in the entertainment industry's dialectic of novelty and
  obsolescence, could still fill the void and provide Americanese with
  its new notes.

This commercial jazz vortex in which machine-age noise could coincide with
ethnic dissonance was short-lived. With the accelerated capitalization and
centralization of the music industry of the later 1920s, popular music
was drawn out of the liminal cultural spaces in which it often operated
and drawn toward a single, moneyed national center. With the creation of
the National Broadcasting Company radio network in 1926, followed the
next year by the Columbia Broadcasting System, the new media behemoths
extending from New York were able to swallow many phonograph companies
and put a policy-setting fear of God into the others. Mergers among film
studios, vaudeville circuits, and music publishing houses placed most of
commercial entertainment in a very few, very large hands (a centering only
furthered with the economic depression of the 1930s). Neil Leonard has
shown how vertical integration encouraged the production of music salable
"through every medium to as many people in as many places as possible."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  This meant&#8212;as a glance at Roger Lax and Frederick Smith's
  <i>Great Song Thesaurus</i> for these years confirms&#8212;that
  novelty produce like "Bananas" lost out increasingly to delocalized,
  de-"ethnicized" fare.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
Bandleader Paul Whiteman, ever at the jazz-as-business avant-garde,
already had anticipated this trend toward refinement in his 1924
"Experiment in Modern Music."

<b></b>

Just one year after its publication, Whiteman presented "Yes! We Have No
Bananas" as a "Comedy Selection"&#8212;not for its cheerful dismantling
of Anglo-Saxonist ethnocentrism and a restrictive national immigration
policy, but for its clever montage of older tunes. Doing so, he set a
precedent&#8212;listen, for example, to song plugger Clarence Senna's
"How To Write a Popular Song" &#8212;in which footnoting the song's
sources became a standard part of its performance.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  As "tune detective" Sigmund Spaeth wrote in his <i>History of Popular
  Music,</i> "It makes an amusing trick to sing the original words
  wherever possible, creating this extraordinary text":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Hallelujah, Bananas!
<br />
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
<br />
I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls&#8212;
<br />
The kind that you seldom see.
<br />
I was seeing Nellie home,
<br />
To an old-fashioned garden
<br />
But, Hallelujah, Bananas!
<br />
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me!
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a singer might be struck by how closely this collage&#8212;in its
abrupt shifts in tense and tone; its mix of operatic, folk, religious,
secular, Standard English, and classical registers; not to mention its
invocation of religious mantras of transcendence, intimations of a lost
Culture, vegetation ceremonies, and nostalgia for love lost o'er water
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 &#8212;resembles the closing of <i>The Waste Land</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I sat upon the shore
<br />
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
<br />
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
<br />
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
<br />
<i>Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina</i>
<br />
<i>Quando fiam uti chelidon</i>&#8212;O swallow swallow
<br />
<i>Le Prince d'Aquitaine &agrave; la tour abolie</i>
<br />
These fragments I have shored against my ruins
<br />
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.
<br />

<p>
Indeed, Whiteman, Senna, and Spaeth's glossing of "Bananas" functioned
like Eliot's own last-minute footnotes for <i>The Waste Land</i>
(fifty-two in all, six for this climactic barrage). Eliot would
maintain the notes simply padded a poem "inconveniently short" for
publication&#8212;a nice recognition of modernism's necessary engagement
with the market&#8212;but Michael Kaufman has argued they "provided Eliot
a means of molding critical opinion and offered a guide for interpreting
the poem as a carefully structured, unified whole."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Just as Eliot's post hoc plan brought his poem to dwell in marbled
  halls, centered in hoary European motifs like the Grail and the Fisher
  King, so, too, tune detective performances of "Yes! We Have No Bananas"
  located the song's innovations

<b></b>

squarely within traditions of European opera, English classical music,
and Scottish and Anglo-American folk song rather than the New World
activities of Jewish, Italian, Greek, or Filipino economic global
subjects. Moreover, this performance strategy made the song's creating
center not the New Immigrant introducing newness into the nation,
but rather the established "native" subject orchestrating preexisting
fragments of a Northern European American Culture and shoring them
against its ruins.

<p>
In his travels from page to stage to screen, Jakie Rabinowitz traced a
course that likewise refined away his messy and multiple ethnic, national,
and occupational identifications, boiling down its jazz singer to an
orchestrator of already extant cultural detritus. For Michael Rogin,
perhaps the filmed <i>Jazz Singer</i>'s most astute interlocutor, the
movie's "subject" is in fact its "blackface method," burnt cork "the
magical substance and transitional object" through which its Jewish jazz
singer finds a voice, achieves commercial success, and bridges Old World
ways and New World ambitions. But if <i>The Jazz Singer</i> was haunted
by blackface's implied racial absence, and further by what Rogin calls
the "structuring absence" of anti-Semitism, it was also haunted by its
own history as a portrait that had not always been drawn in blackface's
bold, clean, Americanizing lines.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Raphaelson's letters to Stuart Sherman might have described the story in
its planning stages as a struggle "between the old Jewish cantor and his
son who is a black-face comedian and ragtime singer in musical comedy,"
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  but the written story never directly connects blackface to its central
  character. It comes closest in song titles that hint at Jack's generic
  "coon" vaudeville persona ("Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Lovey Joe,"
  "When Dat Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'") and through
  oblique reference to another "certain blackface comedian" lacking
  Jack's "swifter, more potent tunefulness" ("DA," 151). The stage
  <i>Jazz Singer</i> gave blackface a more central, and yet ironized
  role. Its middle act takes place backstage while Jack rehearses for
  a show in which he is to play Gus the Porter (a nod to the blackface
  trickster Jolson played in <i>Robinson Crusoe, Jr.,</i> and other
  shows), joking about black hens laying white eggs (<i>JS,</i> 67),
  and singing about "going down South again to the land of cotton and
  jasmine, where the watermelons grow, where I can be with my mammy"
  (<i>JS,</i> 68, and again on 114). The act's second scene (<i>JS,</i>
  102-17) plays charged exchanges among Jack and others against the
  "general business" of blacking up (<i>JS,</i> 103). Yet since Jack's
  rehearsal is offstage with respect to the <i>Jazz Singer</i> audience,
  that audience never is allowed to witness Jack/George Jessel actually
  inhabiting the blackface in performance. Blacking up remains a process
  rather than a completed persona within the play, a gesture quoted
  and defamiliarized as technical routine.

<p>
The film offered the blackface payoff the play withheld. Its closing
image&#8212;Jolson on bended knee, white gloves extended, singing "My
Mammy" to both Mary Dale and an adoring mother&#8212;magically resolved
the narrative's intractable dilemmas through blackface and the sound
that went with it. In good part this was just good business&#8212;the
film's key selling points demanded visible, triumphal performances:
both Jolson's presence and the ballyhooed use of synchronized sound.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  Jolson's star image was bound up in blackface, and in publicity
  photos that accompanied ads, reviews, and feature articles, this was
  how he often appeared&#8212;as Jessel had not (see <a name="2"
  href="10.2jerving_res.html#2"> 2</a>). Reviews, Rogin

<b></b>

reports, likewise devoted "more attention to blackface than to Western
Electric's new sound and film projection system." And the souvenir
program's cover presented blackface as central to its jazz singer's
split identity, one free-floating Jolson head in blackface just behind
another without it ("BWN," 418, 433).

<p>
Bringing blackface to the fore, the film also delocalized the narrative's
ethnic signifiers. Raphaelson, thrilled by the documentary possibilities
of the camera's sweep

<b></b>

and the new sound technology&#8212;"You heard background noises, as
you went through the East Side, you heard the street sounds, and so
on"&#8212;later recalled his disappointment with the rest of the film:
"The picture opened with East Side shots. Then I saw this cantor. They
'refined' him, you see. His whiskers were beautifully combed, as if he
had been to a beauty parlor. And the mother was made just too spotlessly
clean, as though she were demonstrating stoves or refrigerators."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  The play's success with an ethnic audience&#8212;audiences for its
  initial thirty-eight-week run on Broadway had been up to 90 percent
  Jewish&#8212;had first interested Harry, Al, Jack, and Sam Warner
  in producing the film; paterfamiliasBenjamin Warner had taken a
  particular interest, according to the program, in the "faithful
  portrayal of Jewish home life."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  And the film exhibited a certain ethnographic interest in Yiddishkayt,
  both in its location shots and in a filmed performance of real-world
  cantor and Yiddish vaudeville star Yosele Rosenblatt. Indeed,
  the Warners emphasized the film's ethnic grounding by scheduling
  the premiere for the eve of Yom Kippur. Yet the increasing 1920s
  capitalization of the entertainment industry, of which Hollywood's
  conversion to sound was symptomatic, brought film production to an
  unprecedented degree under the watchful eye of Wall Street. Indeed the
  great irony of <i>The Jazz Singer</i> is that, as much as any film,
  it pushed an industry once beholden to local, urban, New Immigrant
  audiences into courting a homogenously imagined national audience to
  whom movies, like stoves or refrigerators, might be uniformly sold.

<p>
Blackface in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> thus provided a visual parallel
to the New Immigrant's broader cultural and political disappearance,
from that audience to which American film addressed itself, and from
those tired, poor, huddled masses to which American immigration policy
addressed itself. As a marker of racial identification that itself masked
intra-European ethnic differences&#8212;"by painting himself black,
he washes himself white," Rogin writes&#8212;blackface's new prominence
signaled a change in how ethnicity could be articulated to aesthetic and
national novelty ("BWN," 440). <i>The Jazz Singer</i> film might be said
to have tacitly recognized the success of 1924's Immigration Restriction
Act, removing Yiddishkayt from that "vivid contrast of surfaces, raucous,
sentimental, egoistical, vulgar, ineffably busy" that, for Raphaelson,
had made jazz synonymous with a vital, shifting "Americanese" (<i>JS,</i>
22). The Immigration Restriction Act, as Henry Sapoznik writes, marked
"the beginning of the end for a renewable Yiddish culture in America,"
cutting off the supply of audiences and performers for whom Yiddish was
an everyday language, and thus consigning Yiddish theater and musical
performance to a vanishing past like that of any other "Old Country"
(including the South under King Cotton), a temporal and geographical
otherness to be outgrown through jazz. Like Paul Whiteman for American
dance music or T. S. Eliot for American poetry, the jazz singer (and
<i>The Jazz Singer</i>) was to play the orchestrator of this otherness
in the postimmigration era.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  So "The Day of Atonement," like "Yes! We Have No Bananas," served as
  a kind of swan song for a jazz sounded simultaneously as a challenge
  to an ethnically restrictive version of American culture and as
  a commercial enterprise, exploiting the contradictions of Fordist
  production and consumption from within the belly of the beast.

<b></b>

<p>
To end where we began, we might return to "I Love to Singa" to
consider it, too, as an epitaph engraved at a particular intersection
of jazz language and ethnic novelty. Audiences who went to see <i>The
Singing Kid</i> in April 1936 would have watched Owl Jolson's real life
counterpart deliver his song's opening in the inimitable song-selling
accents of Lower East Side vaudeville, his performance all emotive
sincerity and physical symmetry. But when Cab Calloway took up the tune,
audiences witnessed a clear passing of the jazz novelty torch. Jiving
from side to side in front of a swinging band, doubled over, hair
falling in and out of place, punctuating loose stabs at the melody
with steep, wailing arabesques, Cab Calloway did not so much sell the
song as render it beside the point, a mere vehicle for individualized,
improvised performance.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Indeed, a new kind of jazz musician had emerged since <i>The Jazz
  Singer</i>'s time for whom Jolson's approach would have seemed as rusty
  as Tin Pan Alley's junk had to Jakie Rabinowitz back in 1922. With
  the music industry's centralization in the late 1920s, musicians
  trained in smaller, looser Midwestern ensembles began to be hired
  as jazz specialists by the large Eastern dance bands. They came to
  hear themselves (as did critics and listeners) as a thing apart from
  the tightly arranged, radio-friendly ensembles in which they worked,
  vipers lurking in the nest of commerce. As Richard Sudhalter describes
  the dynamic, "You could take a job with a commercial band in order
  to pay the rent, as long as you didn't take it seriously."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  Jazz became what you did on your own time: woodshedding, after-hours
  jam sessions, brief solo spots in big band arrangements.

<p>
This pop/jazz distinction would shape how writers have approached jazz
since. When sounded now as a model of political and aesthetic practice,
it is as a sound distinct from the commercial/national mainstream, as a
"boogie woogie rumble," to use Langston Hughes's apt phrase.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  But in its early years on the national stage, jazz could be sounded
  as a force for&#8212;and form of&#8212;an anti-Standard, antinativist
  ethnic dissonance boring from within the commercial center of the
  imagined national harmony. Modernist writers in the 1920s who took to
  jazz heard potential for their own work in an emphasis on "novelty"
  that was generated by the demands of cultural production&#8212;what
  I've called its make-it-obsolete imperative&#8212;and that gained
  through its pervasive, mass access precisely the force to reimagine
  the nation and its language.

21. Raphaelson later went to Hollywood where he helped found the
Screen Writers Guild and had an otherwise long and distinguished
career&#8212;indeed the <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i>
classifies him as a screenwriter. He was particularly known for the
sophisticated, "continental" comedies (<i>&agrave; la</i> Sherman's
<i>intelligentsia</i>?) he scripted with German-Jewish expatriate director
Ernst Lubitsch for films like <i>The Smiling Lieutenant</i> , <i>The
Merry Widow</i> , <i>The Shop Around the Corner</i> , and
<i>Heaven Can Wait</i> . (He also wrote the screenplay for Alfred
Hitchcock's <i>Suspicion</i> [1941].) Apart from <i>The Jazz Singer</i>,
his plays include a "flapper" comedy (<i>Young Love</i> [1926]) and a
"passing" play (<i>Harlem</i>) written shortly after <i>The Jazz</i>

<b></b>

<i>Singer</i> but not performed until 1936 (by then retitled <i>White
Man</i>). Raphaelson also wrote the lyrics to the University of Illinois's
"stadium" song, "t! Illini!" . Aside from Raphaelson's 1925
stage adaptation of this story and the 1927 film that launched a thousand
lips, there also exists a 1927 novelization of the film by Arline DeHaas
(who specialized in such things for Warner Brothers) serialized in a
number of newspapers and titled <i>The Jazz Singer: A Story of Pathos
and Laughter</i> (New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1927).

In letters to Sherman, Samson Raphaelson consistently requested the "great
favor" of the older man's criticism: "the destructive variety preferred"
(4 March 1918). Once Raphaelson had established himself in New York,
he wrote Sherman to say, "You are still, I'm convinced, the only big
'influence' in my life" (7 October 1922). Sherman papers, box 3, folder
21. For his part, Sherman arranged for the struggling Raphaelson to
teach rhetoric courses at Illinois for the 1920-21 academic year, and
Raphaelson would thank Sherman, "who encouraged me when my faith lagged,"
in his dedication to <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (<i>JS,</i> 7). In August
1956, Raphaelson wrote a tribute thirty years after Sherman's death
for the <i>Champaign-Urbana Courier</i> titled "Stuart P. Sherman Shook
Mencken's Throne; Termed Illinois' [<i>sic</i>] Greatest Literary Man"
(undated clipping and original typescript, Samson Raphaelson papers,
University Archives, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, box
2). "Now I do not present myself as a specimen of self-found individual,"
he wrote, explaining Sherman's importance to his generation, "But I do
think I am, or was, a fair sample from the significant minority among
the college students of America who were first made articulate in their
insanity by Mencken, and then encountered Sherman like the rising sun
after a night of carousal." He continued, "If this seems to you like
over-simplification, then you were not young in the 1920s. First there
was W. D. Howells; to us, nobody. Then there was Mencken. Then there
was Sherman. That's all there was. There wasn't any more" .

To grasp this re's full obscenity, weigh it&#8212;much as we might
weigh the cost of restricting Jewish immigration from 1930s Germany,
Poland, Austria, or France&#8212;against the Greek refugee crisis
generated by the Greco-Turkish War. By the time Eliot's <i>Waste Land</i>
had found an American home in the pages of the November 1922 <i>Dial</i>,
Mr. Eugenides&#8212;the Greek one-eyed merchant who made Eliot's narrator
an offer he'd be a fool to refuse (<i>WL</i>, lines 215-7)&#8212;would no
longer have had a home base in Smyrna from which to carry currants for
cost, insurance, and freight to London. This Aegean coastal city, now
Izmir in what is now Turkey, was burned to the ground by Turkish forces
in September 1922, killing 30,000 Greek civilians and displacing many
more. Following the war's Turkish victory, a vast, uneven (though largely
peaceful) population exchange was undertaken in 1923: 400,000 Turks
living in Greece and Bulgaria (some sources say 800,000) were evacuated
to the newly established Turkish Republic; 1,300,000 Greeks living in
Turkey (some sources say 1,500,000) were evacuated to Greece. Greece's
population increased by 20 percent in these years; the population of
Athens doubled. If ever there were tired, poor, huddled masses, these
were they, but squeezing them through the freshly-minted quotas would be
like passing New York Harbor's colossal copper statue through a needle's
eye. See "Greece," Library of Congress Country Studies, December 1994,

Maybe so, but as the Manila version suggests, bananas served as a
condensed metonym connecting the consumer economy at home, imperial
entanglements abroad, and the global division of labor (along with its
domestic version in the ethnicization of occupations). In the first
volume of

<b></b>

<i>U.S.A.</i>, <i>The 42nd Parallel</i> (1930; Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
1946), John Dos Passos vividly described these connections in his
portrait of Minor Keith, "Emperor of the Caribbean," and his empire,
"all of it built out of bananas":




<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in Europe and the United States people had started to eat bananas,
<br />
so they cut down the jungles through Central America to plant bananas,
<br />
and built railroads to haul the bananas,
<br />
and every year more steamboats of the Great White Fleet
<br />
steamed north loaded with bananas,
<br />
and that is the history of the American empire in the Caribbean,
<br />
and the Panama Canal and the future Nicaragua Canal and the marines and
the battleships and the bayonets. [219-20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In <i>U.S.A.</i>'s third volume, <i>The Big Money</i> (1936; Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1946), one of Dos Passos's "Newsreel" montages linked
"Yes! We Have No Bananas" on the one side to a report of wartime
militarism turned against labor by industrialists like steel magnate
Judge Gary, and on the other to headlines whose language&#8212;"KILLS,"
"BURN," "SUICIDE," "MAD," "HUNT"&#8212;hinted at the violence beneath
Jazz Age prosperity, violence institutionalized in protectionist policies
like the Immigration Act .

(spring 1992): 428-9; hereafter abbreviated as "BWN." In arguing as I do,
I part ways with Rogin, for whom blackface's centrality to the film is no
more problematic than its marginality in Raphaelson's story. "Insisting
on the shift from Hebraic particularism to American universalism,"
he writes&#8212;I've been arguing that "The Day of Atonement" is
invested in a particularism simultaneously, to use Rogin's terms,
Hebraic and American&#8212;"neither Raphaelson nor the intertitles
acknowledge blackface as the instrument of that transformation. One
would never know from Raphaelson&#8212;any more than from Henry Ford's
accusation that the 'Jewish song trust makes you sing'&#8212;that
African Americans and not Jews had created jazz" ("BWN," 437). Rogin,
and he's far from alone, regards jazz's origins as the one true key
to its possible cultural meanings (origins he fixes, not incidentally,
in a presumably ethnically untroubled, already completed act), but I've
been arguing that for 1920s audiences jazz was still unfinished cultural
business: not once-and-for-all "created," but still being created and
rearticulated to changing conditions. In this process&#8212;as Ford's
comment suggests&#8212;others other than African Americans, in and
out of blackface, were taking the hit from nativists, restrictionists,
Americanizers, and other 100 percenters.

place Raphaelson's play within the vital Yiddish-language theater of
his time. At the time he was adapting "The Day of Atonement" for the
stage, Raphaelson was also covering Yiddish theater for the <i>New York
Times</i>. "I never went to any other theater when I was a kid in New
York," Raphaelson later remembered: "Who the hell was going to give me
money to do that&#8212;uptown?" (Raphaelson, family tapes, 10 vols.,

Henry Sapoznik, <i>Klezmer!</i>, 116. Raphaelson's earlier writing itself
carries an unpleasant whiff of this emerging cultural order. With a
defensiveness that probably should be heard against the tellingly nativist
attitude expressed by a <i>Herald Tribune</i> reviewer&#8212;"We know of
no play that requires so thorough an understanding of and sympathy with
the Jew and his faith as does this one," the reviewer identified only
as C. B. D. wrote, complaining of the play's performance in a dialect
"wholly unintelligible to us"&#8212;Raphaelson's preface to his play
proved willing to disinclude African Americans from the "ineffably
busy" surface of contemporary American life. "The Jews," he declared,
"are determining the nature and scope of jazz more than any other
race&#8212;more than the negroes, from whom they have stolen jazz and
given it a new color and meaning. Jazz is Irving Berlin, Al Jolson, George
Gershwin, Sophie Tucker." C. B. D., review of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>,

Jolson and Calloway, perfs., <i>The Singing Kid</i>, 1936. Interestingly,
in 1939 Calloway would record "Utt-Da-Zay," a rewriting of the Yiddish
folk song "Ot Azoy Neyt a Shnyader" (That's the Way a Tailor Sews), a
recording that alternates swung choruses with <i>a tempo</i>, doina-like
vocal cadenzas in which, Henry Sapoznik writes, Calloway "demonstrates
brilliant scatting on the outer edges of the cantorial melisma mixed
with his Jewish jive." The recording was part of a brief late-1930s fad
for swing adaptations of Yiddish and klezmer songs and motifs spurred
largely by the success of the 1937 Andrews Sisters recording of "Bei Mir
Bist du Sch&ouml;n," adapted by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin from Sholom
Secunda and Jacob Jacobs's 1932 Yiddish theater show tune "Bey Mir Bistu
Sheyn," which Cahn and Chaplin heard performed in a Harlem theater in
1935 by black duet Johnny and George. In 1937, the Andrews Sisters also
recorded "Joseph, Joseph" (from Nellie Casman's 1923 hit "Yosl, Yosl")
and "Sha, Sha Jascha" (from Adolf King's 1923 "Oy, Iz Dos a Rebetsin"
[Oy, Is That a Rabbi's Wife]). At a 1938 Bluebird session, Benny
Goodman trumpeter Ziggy Elman recorded two klezmer tunes: "Bublitchki"
(Peisachke Burstein's 1929 "Beygelekh" [Bagels]) and "Freilach in Swing"
(Abe Schwartz's 1918 "Der Shtiler Bulgar"), which became a hit for
Goodman as "And the Angels Sing." Slim Gaillard recorded "Vol Vistu
Gaily Star" in 1938 using the chord changes from "Yosl, Yosl," followed
by a 1939 paean to "Matzoh Balls" and a rather late 1945 entry: "Dunkin'
Bagel&#8212;Splat in the Coffee." In 1939, scat singer Leo Watson covered
"Utt-Za-Day" and Calloway recorded "A Bee Gezindt" (Molly Picon and Abe
Ellstein's "Abi Gezunt" [You Should Stay Healthy] from the same year),
which would also be recorded by Mildred Bailey in 1940. And Goodman in
1941 recorded "My Little Cousin" (Abe Schwartz's 1921 "Di Grine Kuzine"
[The Greenhorn Cousin]). That most of the original recordings are from the
pre-Immigration Restriction period is telling, and suggests the degree
to which these late-1930s references were a matter of cultural allusion
rather than cultural infusion. See Henry Sapoznik, <i>Klezmer!</i>,
133-40; and Arthur Levy, prod., <i>From Avenue A to the Great White</i>
Way. Sapoznik's assessment of Calloway is from the liner notes to <i>From
