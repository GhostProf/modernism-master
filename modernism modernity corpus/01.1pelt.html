Already its name seems inassimilable. Before we have recovered from its
harsh and repulsive beginning ("Ausch") we are hit by its violent and
sarcastic end ("Witz"). The name itself already suggests the content
which, according to Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard, is "the experience
of language that brings speculative discourse to an end."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
Staunch Heideggerians, who seek to justify their master's inability
to confront or even name the Holocaust, have declared Auschwitz an
unthinkable realm shrouded in silence. Many others also believe that
silence serves the pious memory of the victims and shows a deferential
respect for the survivors. They declare Auschwitz to be an unintelligible
world, a strange universe that cannot and may not be explained. Hochuth
called it "Planet Auschwitz," a forlorn, damned, and desolate world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Banished from the world of description, analysis, and conclusion,
Auschwitz has become a myth in which the assumed universality of its
impact obscures the contingencies of its beginning. I use the word "myth"
here in the sense that Roland Barthes gave to it in his cele-brated essay
"Myth Today." Mythification, he argued, occurs when language empties a
narrative of its historical contingency to fill it with an unchanging
nature. "In passing from history to nature, myth acts economically: it
abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of
essences..." The result is an account of "bliss-ful clarity" in which
there are no contradictions because statements of fact are interpreted as
explanations. "Things appear to mean something by themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
Today few events can rival the mythic power of "Auschwitz." Unlike
"Hiroshima," which indeed happened in an unintelligible flash, the story
of the atrocity of "Auschwitz" can be depicted in sufficient detail to
arouse our fascination. It takes place on a carefully mapped stage that
holds our attention.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay I aim to recover some of the historical quality of
Auschwitz that, in the words of Barthes, consists in the memory <I>that
it once was made.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is characteristic of a mythic site
<I>that it has always been,</I> since its significance is assigned at
the beginning of Creation, to be redeemed at the end of History. Jewish
legend records that the site of Solomon's Temple marks not only the
foundation stone of the world, but also the place where the Messiah
will appear to Israel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Auschwitz was not preordained to
become the major site of the Holocaust. It actually acquired the role of
"major site" almost by accident, and even the very fact that it became
the site of mass murder resulted more from the failure to achieve one
goal than from the ambition to realize another. To reclaim the reality
of Auschwitz we must become attuned to the contradictions of the site,
not in order to find reasons to deny what happened, but to square the way
it happened with the ways of the world--a world in which the mysterious,
mythifiable forces of malevolence seem ludicrously irrelevant com-pared
to the profane, utterly intelligible, and very effective tendencies
towards insufficiency and expediency.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Jean-Claude Pressac has shown, the contingency of Auschwitz's evolution
even applies to its mythic core: the crematories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In this
essay I will concentrate on another contradiction of the site that
clashes with an essential aspect of the myth of Auschwitz: the idea
that it was quite literally "the end of the world," that is, a place far
away from everywhere else. My choice of subject goes back to a personal
experience. The first time I visited Auschwitz I was surprised that a
center of extermination was located side by side with a major town. I
had seen Lanzmann's film <I>Shoah</I> and remembered its depiction of
the forsaken isolation at the death camps of Treblinka and Sobibor, the
silence of the forests that surrounded them. It was the same seclusion
that I knew from the Dutch transit camp of Westerbork, where the weekly
trains set out upon their fatal journey eastward. Growing up in Holland,
I had always thought that the secret terminus of those trains ought to
have been as deserted as their point of departure. When, forty years
later, I followed the course of those trains, I arrived in a densely
populated area, with large towns, huge industries, and very little
camouflage. And all that development seemed more than fifty years old. I
began to investigate the archives in Poland and found evidence that
increased my confusion. Not only was the camp at Auschwitz built right
next to an existing town, but this very town had been designated as a
center of growth by the same men who had ordered the construction of
the camp. National Socialist Auschwitz was to become a district capital
and the site of massive industrial activity. It became clear that the
mythification of Auschwitz, to which I too had contributed, had blinded
me to a more complex reality in which seemingly opposing things such as
the design for utopia and the reality of dystopia existed alongside each
other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the following pages I aim to situate this relationship in the German
mental map of Central Europe and the geography of the industrialized
region of Upper Silesia. In other words, I try to understand the place
of Auschwitz. I will show how that place became the focus of a Faustian
project to create a German paradise amidst Polish perdition. The
issue of "place," that is, the location of Auschwitz under the sky on
the planet earth, raises the issue of "space," that is, the relation
of the camp to the human body. Thus I will address the architecture
of Auschwitz. Architecture can be defined as the art that mediates,
through place and space, between the infinity of nature (sky and earth)
and the finitude of the body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 I will explore some of the
historical links that connect the place of Auschwitz with space in
Auschwitz. Metaphorically speaking, I will try to describe the stage that
hosted one of the

<B></B>

most profound tragedies the human race has both
permitted and endured. My story ends when the curtain rises--that is,
when Himmler takes the decision to ship Jews to Auschwitz on 26 January
1942. This decision has been interpreted against the background of the
mythical clarity of the Wannsee Conference, held a few days earlier. I
believe that the issues that surrounded the first arrival of Jews in
Auschwitz are more complex than previously assumed, but I simply do
not have the space to treat this very difficult and important issue
responsibly. I will limit myself here to observing that by the early
summer of 1942 Auschwitz-Birkenau had become the site of mass-murder
by means of two primitive gas chambers in adapted peasant houses. A
year later the same camp contained four modern crematories with advanced
killing installations and fourteen incinerators with a total of forty-six
crucibles. For one million people these buildings proved, indeed, the
end of the world.

 Let us turn away from this unqualified evil, and look at the nexus of
 promise and perdition that undergirds the rise of Auschwitz. A good
 point of departure is a proposal for the <I>Stammlager</I> (main camp)
 at Auschwitz which was drawn up in the summer of 1942--that is, at
 the very time that the killing started (<A
 HREF="1.1pelt_fig01.html">fig. 1</A>). The plan, which is
 preserved in the archive of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, was
 drawn up by the architect Lothar Hartjenstein, who worked in the SS
 design office in Berlin. Not only does it show the concentration camp
 itself (usually designated as Auschwitz I), located to the left--with its
 barracks, roll-call place, hospital, prison, work shops, and auxiliary
 structures such as the <I>Kommandantur</I>, the offices of the Gestapo,
 the barracks for the SS men, and so on--but it also shows, to the right,
 a pleasant village for married SS men and their families, including a
 hotel, shops, sports facilities and, on the edge of the barbed-wire fence
 close to the prisoners' hospital, a primary school. The plan symbolizes
 but does not exhaust the juxtaposition of nightmare and dream. It does
 not show the enormous camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau (a mile west of the
 <I>Stammlager</I>), or the town of Auschwitz itself (a mile east of the
 SS village). The camp at Birkenau (also known as Auschwitz II) had,
 by the time Hartjenstein completed this drawing, already become the
 terminus of countless transports with Jews from all over Europe. And
 the town of Auschwitz was the reason why the Germans were there to
 start with, and why they had built that enormous camp at Birkenau.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we explore in more detail the situation in Auschwitz we must get
some sense of the mindset and ambitions of the SS men who killed in the
camp by day and dreamt in the village by night. The plan seems a perfect
evocation of the pride with which National Socialists regarded their
ability to recognize a Manichean polarity in the world. The resulting
black-and-white vision, suggested in the opposition of camp and village,
was perceived as an expression of intellectual clarity. Hence Dietrich
Klagges, in his seminal <I>Geschichtsunterricht als national-politische
Erziehung (History Instruction as National-Political Education</I>),
called for a historiography that emplotted history as the battle between
good (German) and evil (non-German, especially the Jew):

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is dangerously one-sided to present youth only with leaders
and masters, the healthy creative forces of the nation...Forces of
destruction oppose all these constructive forces in fierce combat. One
must constantly refer to these...These include the traitors from our own
race, and the racial-alien Jew, who would like to appear as German, but
who attempts at the same time to destroy the people and the land. They
work together with the enemies from outside, those from

the
North and the South, from the East and the West, who have always tried
to oppress Germany, to conquer it, to destroy it, and to transform it
into a wilderness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
History was thus a protracted battle between the forces of creation and
order and the powers of destruction and chaos. As we all know, this need
for an aesthetic and moral symmetry that balanced the one against the
other was nowhere so present as in the death camps. It was no accident
that the self-declared Nordic racial avant-garde, the men and women of
the SS, were the perpetrators of the Holocaust. This dialectic seems
to inform Hartjenstein's plan. The problem, however, is that the true
opposition exists only within the confines of the camp, in the actual
encounter between the well-groomed, well-dressed, racially superior SS
man and the filthy, rag-clad, racially inferior <I>Untermensch.</I> The
village is only a contingent impli-cation of the fact that even SS men
need to relax, eat, and sleep. It has, however, no direct bearing on
our understanding of the camp itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is also another way to interpret the bisection of the plan. This
is not based on the commonplace of National Socialist racism, but on
the complex of German vocation. Since the second half of the nineteenth
century, Germans had been taught to believe that they, and they alone,
had been the <I>Kulturtr&auml;ger</I> in the land that they called
<I>das deutsche Osten,</I> which roughly coincided with the territory
of the present Republic of Poland. There was some justi-fication to
this claim. In the Middle Ages Germans had, in their notorious <I>Drang
nach Osten,</I> brought Western technological, economic, and political
know-how to the less developed Slavs. But they had done the same for
the natives of Cameroon at the turn of the century. What made the German
East different from Cameroon was the fact that Germany's civilizing role
in Africa had no effect on the German sense of identity, while German
involvement with Poland had shaped, according to prominent scholars,
the Germans' sense of themselves and their destiny. In 1934 the German
anthropologist Josef Nadler identified the German "Push to the East" as
the event that had shaped the Germans into a <I>Weltvolk,</I> involving
all the German tribes which had hitherto remained politically, culturally,
and to some degree linguistically independent. Hence "this space [the
East] became the cradle of the idea of a common German destiny, of a
common German language, of a common modern German education, of a united
German state...When the Germans cross the historic river boundary [between
West and East] a new German world epoch begins, ethnic, spiritual, and
poli-tical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Three years later a popular history of this
"Push to the East" stated unequivocally:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The German settlement of the East proves to be the central pillar in the
total make-up of the German nation. Its history mirrors German history
in general with penetrating clarity. One must know it for a general
understanding of the history of the German land and the German people,
and, consequently, for a correct and profound appreciation of the German
character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The central word here is settlement. The geopolitical doctrine of
<I>Lebensraum,</I> which formed the foundation of Germany's infatuation
with the East, implied that a nation did not gain anything by conquering
other nations in order to rule them for economic profit. The only
purpose of colonization was settlement. To a German in the 1930s <I>das
(deutsche) Osten</I> equalled <I>Siedlung.</I> Everyone agreed that
the ideology of settlement pervaded and vitalized the whole of German
history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Therefore the German East was the mythical
region that held the whole of German history together. The resulting
German self-definition as a nation of

<I>Siedler</I> (settlers)
was attractive, as it brought together in one image the opposites of
adven-ture and commitment, horizon and place, future and past, universal
and particular. As a popular history of the German East explained,

"that land is German!" After all it is not superficially "occupied" but

The narrative closed by observing, "this is also the reason that this
'Great Feat of the German Nation,' as the colonization of the East has

stagnation and obstruction, profoundly influences the contem-porary
German direction of life."

The man who was chiefly responsible for transforming the ideology of
resettlement into practical policy was <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I>
Heinrich Himmler (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig02.html">fig. 2</A>). This
responsibility dated from 7 October
1939, when Hitler had appointed Himmler as <I>Reichskommissar f&uuml;r
die Festigung deutschen Volkstums.</I> As such, he was responsible for
a massive program to evacuate hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans
who were scattered in the countries that had fallen within the Soviet
sphere of influence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and
to resettle them in those parts of Poland that Germany had conquered
in September 1939 and was officially to annex on 26 October of that
year. Hitler had openly announced this program in his Reichstag speech
a day before Himmler's appointment when he called for the establishment
of a new ethnic order in the former Polish territories with an eye to
the "resettlement of nationalities in such a manner that the process
ultimately results in the obtaining of better dividing lines than is
the case at present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 From the very beginning Himmler took
great pride in the new role that allowed him to become one of the master
builders of the New Europe. In an illustrated editorial of <I>Das Schwarze
Korps,</I> he reflected on the history and future of German settlement
in the East:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The great epochs of a nation find the ultimate expression of their inner
force and power in its works of culture. <I>One</I> truth stands at the
beginning and the end of each historic epoch: stones will speak when
the people have fallen silent. Great epochs already speak in stone to
the present.

Following this was a description of the German castles in the East,
"testimonies of soldier-like conquest and stubborn defense, as well
as symbols of high German culture." The most famous German castle, the
onetime headquarters of the Teutonic Order at Marienburg, was "a memorial
of the right to life and the will to persist of the whole German nation
in the East."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 For Himmler the castles had preserved the
German claim on the East throughout the more than five centuries between
the collapse of German power in the fifteenth century and the rise
of National Socialism in the present. Thus he urged Germans to create
con-ditions such that a decline of German power would never happen again.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the reasons that Hitler had chosen Himmler as
<I>Reichskommissar</I> was the fact that Himmler headed the ideal tool
to create this New Order: the SS. As a paramilitary force it had the
muscle to take responsibility for the necessary ethnic cleansing, and as
the National

<B></B>

Socialist racial and ideological avant-garde, imbued
with ideas of "Blood and Soil," it could provide the human resources
for rebuilding the German East into a Nordic paradise. The ordinary SS
men were left in no doubt as to their role in these territories, which
was described in detail by an SS handbook. The conquest of Poland had
not brought an alien land under German control. On the contrary: it
restored to the German <I>Lebensraum</I> "what German diligence had
created in the course of time." A massive program of reconstruction
was to consolidate "what has been gained in battle and make it into
an eternally linked part of the Greater German space. <I>The German
East was for centuries the German people's space of destiny. It will
remain so for the following centuries."</I> This reconstruction had a
demographic dimension. "The ethnic mosaic of the East demands a new
arrangement, which is historically, morally, and ethically totally
justified. Connected with the <I>new ordering of space in the East</I>
is not only the <I>German-Polish problem</I> and the one caused by other
ethnic minorities, but also the <I>Solution to the Jewish Problem</I>
as such." The text went on to blame the Jews for all that was wrong in
Poland. The ghettos were the source of epidemics and the breeding ground
of a criminal class. "The cooperation of Jewry and Poles produced the
notorious 

<B></B>

<I>'Polish State of Affairs.'</I> What this Polish State
of Affairs amounted to has become clear to even the simplest German
soldier during the Polish Campaign. <I>In the regained areas in the East
a comprehensive reconstruction is taking place with the aim of overcoming
this Polish State of Affairs and replacing it with German order and German
culture, lifting up the suppressed and enslaved Germans from the East, and
finally linking this soil now and forever with the German nation."</I>
The handbook continued with the observation that the recon-struction
was a titanic enterprise that involved radical land reform in which
up to ten small, non-viable Polish farms would be combined to make
one prosperous German farm. "The land will have to be rebuilt from the
soil up, village by village. Whole villages will have to disappear when
fields with a low yield are reforested." Traditionally the German East
had suffered from the draining effect of the departure of farm laborers
for the industrial areas in the West. To give them a reason to stay it
was important to improve their condition, which included their housing:

In the same way that the unacceptable division of property demands reform,

the East has already come to its completion. This program also involves
<I>the architectural reconstruction of the towns</I> in the East, which
should once again become centers of a German will for reconstruction
as they were in earlier days, and like the German farms and villages,
symbols of German life and German creation.

We have some remarkable accounts that attest to Himmler's obsession
with this utopian project. One of them dates from early 1940, and was
written by Himmler's personal friend Hanns Johst. The latter travelled
with Himmler through Poland to inspect the progress of a program of
ethnic cleansing, and recorded how, repeatedly during their trip,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I> stopped the car, climbed over the striated
ditches, walked into the fields ploughed over by grenade shells, took
some dirt between his fingers, smelled it thoughtfully with inclined
head, crushed the crumbs of the field between his fingers, and then
looked over the vast, vast space which was full, full to the horizon,
with this good, fertile earth. Thus we stood like ancient farmers and we
smiled at each other with twinkling eyes. All of this was now German soil!

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And the two men considered how the German settlers would soon change the
appearance of the land. Here trees and hedges would be planted. Shrubs
would grow, and weasels and hedgehogs, buzzards, and falcons would prevent
half of the harvest from perishing because of mice and vermin. All of
this was a great work of culture undertaken in awe of nature. And they
speculated on how these changes would "create protection from the wind,
increase dew, and stimulate the formation of clouds, force rain, and thus
push a more economically viable climate further toward the East." And,
referring to the great resettlement programs already underway, they
predicted that "under professional, rational, and scientific leadership,
the Balt, Galician, and Volhynian returnees will do miracles." And
Johst recorded how the two men stood in the fields, held conquered
soil in their hands, and gazed "over the whole of these indifferently
treated surfaces...populat[ing] them with villages surrounded by rustling
orchards..." Almost as a kind of afterthought he jotted down that "the
Western world cannot understand this pure pleasure derived from task
and work, from sweat and calluses. It thinks

Neither Himmler nor Johst bothered about the millions of gentile and
Jewish Poles who were to be deported from their farms, villages, and
towns to make space for the ethnic German arrivals. On their trip through
Poland Himmler and Johst visited Upper Silesia, in the eastern region
where towns like Auschwitz, Blachstadt, and Saybusch, interpreted by
Himmler as relics of German medieval colonization, had become centers of
ethnic cleansing and large-scale ecological, architectural, and urban
reconstruction. In a meeting in the government house of Upper Silesia,
located in the town of Kattowitz, Himmler and the military and civilian
authorities in the region talked openly about the policies to be enacted:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
These lecturers do not speak in commonplaces, which one can noddingly
affirm without further thought. They present the hard facts, and they ask
concrete questions of Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as chief of the

gentlemen and their departments clear and forcible directions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Johst was enthralled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is wonderful to experience how here one calmly and dispassionately
organizes the migration of whole nations. Hundreds of thousands of
people stream into the Reich, and are settled in the East...others
are deported...and it all happens while the nation fights the greatest
defensive battle for its existence. Everything happens as if it were
the most self-evident, the simplest issue in the world!

And he added, "at such moments I almost understand the hatred of the
Western world for everything German. Nothing was ever so hateful as
superiority, as natural superiority, by virtue of the belief in an idea,
by virtue of achievements, and by virtue of results."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Johst was not the only one who would be astonished at the frankness
with which Himmler discussed in public the nature and impact of his
policies. In his notorious speech given to the SS leadership on 4 October
1943, Himmler discussed the Holocaust openly, congratulating himself and
his comrades for the fact that they had "carried out this heaviest of
our tasks in a spirit of love for our people. And our inward being, our
soul, our character has not suffered injury from it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 A year
earlier he had discussed with equal frankness the problem of labor in the
German East. Originally Himmler had intended to rely on the Reich Labor
Service for the labor to plant new forests, drain the marshes, build the
roads, prepare the settlements, and so on. But by 1942 the whole of the
Reich Labor Service had been mobilized for the war and ceased to be at
Himmler's disposal. Himmler could not wait until the Reich Labor Service
could furnish manpower for peacetime projects. Noting that the SS had
been charged with providing a stable foundation for a German future in
the East, "a foundation that allows individuals who come fifty, eighty,
one hundred, or two hundred years after us to cave in or to lose their
heads without endangering the future of the German <I>Imperium,"</I>
Himmler announced the formation of an enormous army of slaves:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If we do not create the bricks here, if we do not fill our camps with
slaves--in this room I state these things precisely and clearly--with
workslaves who will build our cities, our villages, and our farms,

money to create

such settlements that allow a truly Germanic people
to live with dignity and take root within one generation."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Himmler's use of the word "bricks" had both a metaphorical and literal
sense. The German concentration camps, which Himmler controlled as
<I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS,</I> had acquired in the late 1930s a key role
in the German production of building materials. Originally intended as an
instrument of terror to stabilize the National Socialist regime, at first
the camps had not been used to furnish labor for productive work, as this
would have competed with German business and hindered the reduction of
high unemployment. By 1937, however, the camps were becoming superfluous
as political tools, for the regime was now firmly established and enjoyed
general approval. The number of inmates had dropped from 30,000 in early
1934 to 10,000, and a German future without concentration camps had
become conceivable. Yet Himmler did not want to close them. First, they
provided him a political power base; more important, he very clearly saw
the camps' economic potential in a situation of labor shortage. Already in
1936-37 Himmler began to consider the productive potential of possible
concentration camp sites. Dachau was to remain where it was, but the
new camps at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen were established in places
that seemed optimal. Both were to be involved in the production of
bricks to service the local programs of urban reconstruction. With
an eye to providing the city of Weimar with brick, the SS decided to
locate Buchenwald on the wooded Ettersberg, five miles from the former
capital, a site chosen because it was adjacent to large loam and clay
deposits. Sachsenhausen was to serve Speer's building program in Berlin;
located twenty-five miles north of the city along the Hohenzollern
canal in the town of Oranienburg, it offered good possibilities
for bulk transport to the capital. Having decided on the location of
these two camps, in early 1938 Himmler founded the <I>Deutsche Erd und
Steinwerke</I> (<I>DESt,</I> or German Earth and Stone Works) to set
up and run the brickworks at Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and possibly
other places, as well as to open and exploit granite quarries. The
first brickyard to be opened was the one near Buchenwald, planned to
have a capacity of 7 million bricks per year. With a subsidy of RM
9.5 million given by Speer, <I>DESt</I> also began construction of
a brickyard in Oranienburg, intended to be the largest brickyard in
the world with an annual production of 150 million bricks, ten times
as many as the largest existing brickyards could yield. The same year
<I>DESt</I> bought a defunct brickyard near Hamburg and began to plan a
40-million-brick-a-year production facility to supply the reconstruction
of Hamburg. A new concentration camp, Neuengamme, was built adjacent to
the factory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To supply Speer with granite, <I>DESt</I> began to operate granite
quarries in 1938. The first two to be acquired were a quarry near
Flossenb&uuml;rg, close to the Czech border in the Upper Palatinate, and a
famous granite quarry adjacent to the Upper Austrian town of Mauthausen,
near Linz. Before 1914 the quarries of Mauthausen had supplied most
of the granite used in Vienna, Budapest, and the smaller cities of the
former Austrian-Hungarian empire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The quality of the stone
and the town's location along a major transport corridor had contributed
to its fame. With the dissolution of the empire, however, Mauthausen had
fallen on hard times. Demand for granite had decreased, even as the use
of concrete increased. For the town of Mauthausen the <I>Anschluss</I>
of 1938 was a welcome event; in Hitler's Germany, granite was again the
premier building material for public buildings. A few days after the


<B></B>

<I>Anschluss,</I> Himmler and his aide Oswald Pohl, who controlled
the administration of the SS and its companies, toured the Mauthausen
area with an eye to establishing a <I>DESt</I> branch to exploit
its riches. After some negotiation, the city leased two quarries to
<I>DESt;</I> adjacent to each, the SS began to build a camp. The same
pattern was applied in Flossenb&uuml;rg, and to <I>DESt</I> operations
in Silesia and the Alsace. Quarries were identified and assessed in
relation to transport and markets, then leased or purchased, and finally
complemented by new camps to provide labor: in Silesia the quarries,
which Speer had designated as the main suppliers of Berlin, were to
be serviced by Gross-Rosen and in the Alsace, by Natzweiler. In some
cases the pattern was reversed. The concentration camp in Auschwitz, for
example, was established adjacent to the formerly Polish town because
of demographic and political reasons. But within a few months of its
establishment, <I>DESt</I> acquired a gravel and sand production facility
close to the camp.

More important than the production of gravel was Auschwitz's function
as a labor reserve to facilitate German reconstruction of the eastern
part of Upper Silesia. For various eco-nomic and geopolitical reasons,
Auschwitz had attracted the attention of the men charged by Himmler
with the long-range planning of the German East. As early as July 1940
Himmler had been convinced by <I>Professor Doktor</I> Konrad Meyer that
a speedy Germanization of the area around Auschwitz was of the highest
priority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Himmler's Chief of Staff, Ulrich Greifelt,
concurred. "It is very urgent at this point to create a purely ethnic
German corner," he wrote, also suggesting several communities as potential
places of settlement by ethnic Germans, among them the town of Auschwitz
and the nearby village of Birkenau (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig03.html">fig. 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 On Thursday,
10 October 1940 a meeting held in Kattowitz and attended by the SS and
Upper Silesia's civil servants decided that part of the new province was
going to be used for massive settlement by ethnic Germans. A map created
for this meeting designated the area around Auschwitz as <I>Siedlungszone
1a</I> (Zone of Settlement 1a) (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig04.html">fig. 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 This designation
implied that the given area offered few impediments to the envisioned
physical and social trans-formation. A master plan for the future of
the region was to be completed by the spring of 1941.

Planning started quickly indeed. The Germans set to work on both regional
and municipal designs. In December 1940 the architect Dr. Hans Stosberg
accepted the task of creating a master plan for the reconstruction
and enlargement of Auschwitz. After two months of work he produced a
preliminary design (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig05.html">fig. 5</A>), accompanied
by an explanatory document
that is printed as an appendix to this essay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It noted
that Auschwitz was located at the center of three major industrial
areas, and that it offered good building ground and a bountiful supply
of water. This was important because of the Upper Silesian coal mines
located on the watershed between the Oder and the Vistula; their coal,
being of relatively low grade, was intended to serve as raw material for
chemical industries, but the unavailability of water effectively prevented
the location of such plants adjacent to the mines. Auschwitz, because of
the confluence of three rivers, was the closest site with the requisite
water supply. Stosberg's draft assumes a city of first 35,500, and later
47,000 inhabitants. The largest single employer would be the chemical
industry, an IG Farben plant, to make artificial rubber from coal, a
complex that would employ 3,000 people who were to live in their own
quarter. Eventually, both the plant and a small part of the IG Farben
neighborhood were built. The draft continues with the railways, which
would employ 1,500 people. These workers and their

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 93]</B>

families
would live in a quarter close to the station. The document also mentions
"SS and ancillary businesses (but not the barracks and the concentration
camp inmates)." This would involve 1,500 workplaces.

Stosberg's design was faced with a number of vexing limitations. Space was
tight. It was clear that the industry was to go to the town's east. To
the south there was a large floodplain unsuitable for anything but
recreational use; to the north the same condition applied; and to the
west the town was surrounded on three sides by the concentration camp's
<I>Interes-sengebiet</I> (Zone of Interests), which was forbidden
territory. In his initial report of December 1940, Stosberg had
thought it possible to harmonize the needs of the concentration camp
for security with the needs of the town for breathing space. But as he
continued to design and the camp continued to expand, relations between
Stosberg and the SS soured. Stosberg and SS architect Hartjenstein
developed mutually exclusive plans for the quarter located between the
railway lines with the station, the <I>Stammlager</I> in Zasole, and
the river Sola (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig06.html">fig. 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Stosberg's design for the civic
peninsula that carved its way from the river bank into the camp's Zone
of Interests was meant to provide citizens with a dignified if not
festive access to the trains by means of a great boulevard that was to
be the spine of New Town West, a densely built-up neighborhood for 7,500
people. Hartjenstein's proposal for the SS settle-ment engulfed some fifty
percent of Stosberg's neighborhood, reducing it to what Stosberg termed
a "torso." Furthermore, the vernacular character of the SS Garden City
with its cozy one-family homesteads set in large gardens contradicted
the strongly urban character of Stosberg's plan, a note the latter
considered appropriate for the central urban axis connecting the city's
major elements: the station to the medieval <I>Ring</I> and, beyond that,
the new plaza <I>(Parteiforum)</I> that was to embody Auschwitz's dignity
as capital of a new county (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig07.html">fig. 7</A>),
the eastern neighborhood, and the
immense IG Farben plant that was to provide the economic justification
for all these improvements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There were really two solutions to the problem: either the SS settlement
had to conform to the urban density of Stosberg's plan, providing an
appropriate southern flank to the avenue mentioned above, or the SS had
to move the Garden City to another site within their Zone of Interests,
allowing for a new border between the city and the camp, one closer
to the <I>Stammlager.</I> Stosberg was supported by the provincial
bureaucracy. But the camp also had strong supporters, not the least of
whom was Himmler. The two parties argued for almost a year, pushing the
border between the city and the camp up and down between the proposed
avenue and the perimeter of the camp. Ultimately the issue was settled in
favor of the city; in a large meeting held in Auschwitz on Wednesday, 23
September, the chief of the S<I>S-Wirtschafts Verwaltungshauptamt</I>
(<I>WVHA,</I> or  SS Economic and Administrative Department),
<I>SS-Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer</I> (General) Oswald Pohl, withdrew
Hartjenstein's proposal and an-nounced that he had ordered the
architect to prepare a master plan that moved the settlement to the
south side of the <I>Stammlager,</I> firmly within the camp's Zone of
Interests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 None of these difficulties was anticipated in
Stosberg's 1941 report. There he still assumed that the camp's development
would not obstruct the "organic" development of the town. In view of
the later use of Auschwitz-Birkenau as an extermination plant, it is
ironic that Stosberg identified that area (between the station and the
Vistula) as a good site to establish "SS industrial installations."

Stosberg continued to work on his plan, of which important relics
remain. One is a double-folded New Year's greeting card that he sent in
December 1941. On the front he wished his

benefactors and friends
"health, happiness, and a good outcome for every new beginning." The

market (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig08.html">fig. 8</A>), while the back contained
a four-sentence meditation
placing Auschwitz firmly within the National Socialist Myth of the
German East:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the year 1241 Silesian knights, acting as saviors of the Reich, warded
off the Mongolian assault at Wahlstatt. In that same century Auschwitz
was founded as a German town. After six hundred years the
<I>F&uuml;hrer</I> Adolf Hitler is turning the Bolshevik menace away
from Europe. This
year, 1941, the construction of a new German city and the reconstruction
of the old Silesian market have been planned and initiated.

As we will see below, the suggested relation between Hitler's attack on
the Soviet Union and the reconstruction of Auschwitz did not exist only
in history. It also applied to space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The realization of Stosberg's proposal depended on the availability
of labor. Himmler was to oblige him. On 1 March 1941, on his way to
a gathering of Bukowinian Germans who were waiting in camps in and
around Breslau for their final resettlement in the region just south of
Auschwitz, Himmler visited Auschwitz and ordered the construction of
a large prisoner-of-war camp in Birkenau. A few weeks earlier he had
been informed of Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union in the
spring, and Himmler had immediately recognized that the expected mass
of Soviet prisoners of war would provide him with the labor force he
needed to continue the reconstruction of the German East. As the area
around Auschwitz had been assigned top priority in this project, it made
sense for the region to receive the bulk of prisoners of war who would be
transferred into SS custody by the Army. According to the commandant of
the concentration camp, Rudolf H&ouml;ss, the various provincial officials
present at Himmler's visit were not very happy at the prospect of 100,000
Soviet prisoners two

kilometers from Auschwitz, and raised
their objections with the <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS.</I> "Himmler just
smiled," H&ouml;ss recalled in 1946, "and disposed of their objections
saying, 'Gentlemen, this project will be completed; my reasons are more
important than your objections!'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Even purely technical
objections were not taken seriously. The wetlands of Birkenau were of
crucial significance for the province's future. Most of Upper Silesia's
population lived in a densely settled industrial belt occupying a
plateau that formed, as we saw before, a watershed between the rivers
Oder and Vistula; as a result the region lacked water, a deficiency that
potentially limited future develop-ment. To redress this, the province
had designated the lowland between the Vistula and the Sola as a major
water reservoir for the industrial heart of Upper Silesia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
Provincial bureaucrats now argued that the sewage of 100,000 people was
going to make it impossible to maintain the water quality, but Himmler
impatiently dismissed their concerns: water management was merely a
matter of technology to be solved by the experts (H&ouml;ss, 285).

the bloody rides of [the Hun] Attila and [the Mongol] Genghis Khan,"
explained the text on the left. "On ugly little horses, almost grown
together with the skin of their animals, the Hun hordes dashed against
Europe. Their split eyes glowed with lust to kill and behind them they
left only wilderness, murder, fire, and destruction." And, turning to the

Convinced that the war against the Soviet Union was a crusade to protect
European civili-zation against Asian barbarism, the leadership of the

in the East. This decision reflected a widely felt German sentiment. More

The new attitude also affected the treatment of Soviet prisoners
of war. In the notorious "Guidelines for the Treatment of Political
Commissars," better known as the "Commissar Order," which was issued on 6
June 1941, the German army was forbidden to grant prisoner-of-war status
to captured Soviet political commissars. Instead these "bearers of the
Judeo-Bolshevik world view" were to be shot after identification. The
army's acceptance of the Commissar Order opened the road for more
violations of international law. On 28 June 1941, the general in charge of
the Prisoner of War Department of the German Army High Command concluded
a draft agreement with the SS that allowed SS <I>Einsatzkommandos</I>
(Special Units) to enter prisoner-of-war camps to select and execute
already imprisoned commissars, communist functionaries of all ranks,
agitators and fanatical communists, and "all Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 This
agreement came into force on 17 July. The army justified it by noting
that "the special situation of the Eastern campaign...demands special
measures." Military consi-derations were now going to give way to the
"political objective," which was to "protect the German nation from
Bolshevik inciters."

Less dramatic, but ultimately more deadly, was the German unwillingness
to provide the remaining prisoners with sufficient accommodation. Three
major international conventions, the First Hague Convention , the
Second Hague Convention , and the Geneva Convention  had
established minimal standards of prisoner maintenance. Yet because the
Soviet Union had not been a signatory to the last convention, which had
merely clarified certain points of the earlier ones that were already
ruling as law on the basis of custom, the German high command was led
to the criminal assumption that none of the conventions applied. I will
discuss some of their provisions later in more detail. Suffice it note
that already in the early summer of 1941 catastrophic conditions began
to occur in the camps holding Soviet prisoners of war. "Camps" is in
fact a euphemism: a camp consisted of fields surrounded by barbed-wire
fences. The inmates were to build themselves shelters, but no materials
were provided. One of them, camp Lamsdorf in Silesia, reportedly held
some 200,000 prisoners:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The camp was simply a square area of land where most of the Russians
huddled together in huts made from the earth which they had built
themselves. Food distribution to the camp was irregular and totally
inadequate. The prisoners cooked for themselves in fire pits in the ground
(H&ouml;ss, 132).

Unwilling and unable to deal with the problem, the army negotiated a
transfer of Soviet pri-soners with Himmler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 As we have
seen, on Saturday, 1 March 1941 Himmler had desig-nated Birkenau as the
site for a large camp. Yet for months nothing had been done toward its
construction, and no funds had been allocated. When the Soviet prisoners
arrived in early October in Birkenau, there was no camp available. Yet
the Germans were happy to supply the designs. In fact, they had created a
new architectural office headed by Karl Bischoff (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig09.html">fig. 9</A>). Bischoff had
begun work in early October 1941, and a first master plan was drawn by
his assistant, the thirty-three-year-old Bauhaus graduate Fritz Ertl,
on 7 October (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig10.html">fig. 10</A>). The plan proposed
a two-part camp for a total
of 97,000 inmates. The smaller part, <I>Bauabschnitt I</I> (Building
Sector I, abbreviated as <I>BA I</I>), which could hold a little under
17,000 inmates,

<B></B>

was a quarantine camp, a reasonable provision
given the bad physical condition of the arriving prisoners; the larger
part, <I>Bauabschnitt II</I> (Building Sector II, abbreviated as <I>BA
II</I>), designed to hold a little over 80,000 inmates, was the main
camp. They were separated by a "neutral zone" (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig11.html">fig. 11</A>). In a meeting
held in mid-October the plan was modified, creating a second version that
became the basis for a fourteen-page document that explains the design
in detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The most important change was an increase in
the camp's capacity from 97,000 to 125,000 inmates. One drawing, which
shows a section of the standard hut to be built, leaves no doubt that the
increase was achieved by cramming more inmates into the same space. The
original drawing, signed by Bischoff on 8 October, listed a capacity of
550 men (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig12.html">fig. 12</A>). A week later Bischoff
had crossed out the "550" and
replaced it with "744".
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Nothing else had changed. Perhaps
Bischoff's decision was inspired by the arrival of the first prisoners
of war. "They arrived in Auschwitz after long weeks of marching with
very little food supplied to them on route. During the breaks in their
march they were simply led into nearby fields and told to 'graze' like
cattle on everything that was edible." Having arrived, "they walked
around aimlessly in a daze, or they crawled anywhere into a protected
area to swallow something edible that they found. They tried to force
it down their throats, or they simply, quietly, found a place to die"
(H&ouml;ss, 133). Fear of anarchy also led to another modification: the
main camp <I>(BA II)</I> was now to be subdivided into twelve smaller,
self-sufficient "camps"--an arrangement that was to persist throughout all
subsequent modifications (<I>BA IIa, b, c, d, e</I> and <I>f</I>). Yet
another modification was the inclusion of a rail spur to connect the
camp directly to the railway junction a mile to the east. In the future
prisoners were to arrive by train (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig13.html">fig. 13</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Working in a hurry, Bischoff had been drawing plans without informing
Berlin and with no sense of available funding. On 25 October, SS
headquarters telegraphed Bischoff to remind him that a budget could
not be approved unless he submitted the plans according to the usual
procedures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 A package was hastily created. The total budget
was to be RM 8.9 million, which compares in 1993 to $36 million. In an
accompanying letter Bischoff wrote that <I>BA I</I> was already under
construction and would be finished in fourteen days. It was not the last
time that Bischoff turned out to be far too optimistic about the amount of
con-struction that could be achieved in Auschwitz. The Soviet prisoners,
as H&ouml;ss observed, were "perfectly willing to work, but unable to
accomplish anything because of their weakened condition...The entire
body organism was finished and could no longer function" (H&ouml;ss,
132f.). None of this affected calculations back in Berlin: the SS head
office reduced the total cost from RM 8.9 million to RM 7.7 million. The
standard rate for labor costs did not apply because the prisoners were
to build the camp themselves, and for free.

Closer study of the actual designs reveals how the Nazi identification
of the Soviet soldier as an <I>Untermensch</I> was translated into
architectural terms. The prisoners were to be housed in 174 barracks. Each
barrack was to measure 116 ft. by 36 ft., that is, 4,176 sq. ft. Total
volume was 13,257 cu. ft. The barrack was subdivided into 62 bays, each
of 43 sq. ft., and each bay had three "roosts" (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig14.html">fig. 14</A>). Originally
a roost was supposed to hold three prisoners, but, as we have seen,
in mid-October the capacity had been increased to four. To sleep, sit,
and keep his belongings, each prisoner was now provided with "private"
space that amounted to 11 sq. ft., the dimensions of a large coffin, or
an average volume of 53 cu. ft., the size of a shallow grave. The cost
per barrack was to be RM 12,400, that is, RM 16.67 per inmate.

Inmates were being deprived of the minimum space needed to exist. Tadeusz
Borowski, who was interned in Auschwitz in 1943 as prisoner number
119,198, described the condi-tions in the camp as more horrendous than
medieval fantasies about hell:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If the barrack walls were suddenly to fall away, many thousands of people,
packed together, squeezed tightly in their bunks, would remain suspended
in mid-air. Such a sight would be more gruesome than medieval paintings
of the Last Judgment. For one of the ugliest sights to a man is that of
another man sleeping on his tiny portion of the bunk, of the space which
he must occupy, because he has a body--a body that has been exploited to
the utmost: with a number tattooed on it to save on dog tags, with just
enough sleep at night to work during the day, and just enough time to
eat. And just enough food so it will not die wastefully. As for actual
living there is only one place for it--a piece of bunk. The rest belongs
to the camp, the Fatherland.

Borowski's comparison with medieval visions of hell was apt. Yet if there
is a certain justification to the sufferings of medieval sinners who
have been judged by God, nothing can justify the treatment of inmates at
Birkenau, arbitrarily selected by an SS doctor. In the medieval paintings
and reliefs, guilt and retribution are still related as cause and effect;
in Birkenau it is the other way around. In a Kafkaesque inversion of
crime and punishment, the camps first penalized people and then made
them guilty. Anyone forced to live in the barracks could only become
an object lesson for a photo-essay exploring the life and appearance of
the <I>Untermensch.</I>

The extraordinarily small space allocated to each inmate and the high
mortality rate within the huts meant that inmates would often die during
the night, and that those who were still alive had no way to remove the
corpses. Primo Levi, who experienced this in January 1945, reflected on
the implications of this forced intimacy between the living and the dead:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
 It is man who kills, man who creates or suffers injustice; it
is no longer man who, having lost all restraint, shares his bed with
a corpse. Whoever waits for his neighbour to die in order to take his
piece of bread is, albeit guiltless, further from the model of thinking
man than the most primitive pygmy or the most vicious sadist.

Confronted with such a world we, outsiders, can only react like the
Soviet soldiers who liber-ated the camp the next day. Levi described
how they stood at the barbed wire, looking at the emaciated prisoners

oppressed not only by compassion but by a confused restraint, which sealed
their lips and bound their eyes to the funereal scene." It was not that

The design, which postulated a living space so tiny that it was fit
for a coffin and not a human being, showed a blatant disregard for
international law protecting prisoners of war. According to article
7 of the 1899 Hague Convention, "prisoners of war shall be treated as
regards food, quarters, and clothing, on the same footing as the troops
of the government which has captured them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 This principle
was reaffirmed in a second convention in 1907. The German General Staff
acknowledged its validity. Their sole clarification of article 7 was that
the prisoners were to be treated like German soldiers, "not worse, but
also not better."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The 1929 Geneva Convention sought to define
the standard soldier with whom a prisoner should be compared. Article 10
of the 1929 convention established two criteria. First, prisoners were to
"be lodged in buildings or in barracks affording all possible guarantees
of hygiene and healthfulness. The quarters must be fully protected from
dampness, sufficiently heated and lighted. All precautions must be taken
against danger of fire." This statement was open to interpretation. It
assumed a compromise between generally accepted standards of comfort
and healthiness and limitations on the means of the detaining power to
meet them. Second, a more objective standard was given: "with regard to
dormitories--the total surface, minimum cubic amount of air, arrangement
and material of bedding--the conditions shall be the same as for the
troops at base camps of the detaining power."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The designation
"base camps" indicated that the norm was not the accommodation of
soldiers in the trenches, but of those at rest or in training in the
rear. As prisoner-of-war camps were supposed to be in the rear, in
practice this meant that the accommodations of the prisoners and their
guards were to be comparable. That this was not the case at Birkenau is
demonstrated by a photo illustrating the guards' quarters (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig15.html">fig. 15</A>). For
a bedroom of nine guards official guidelines stipulated 3,600 cu. ft.,
or 400 cu. ft. per person. That is, eight times as much space allocated
for sleeping accommodations alone, to which one might add dining halls,
recreation rooms, and so on.

This should suffice. Yet a perverse curiosity makes us compare the
accommodations at the prisoner-of-war camp at Birkenau with the
official SS standards for concentration-camp barracks. On the same
day that Bischoff had begun work in Birkenau, his immediate superior,
Dr. Hans Kammler, issued a standard plan for the accommodation of
concentration-camp inmates (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig16.html">fig. 16</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Comparison of the
two plans reveals how the Germans treated the Soviet <I>Untermensch</I>
in comparison with European inmates. To allow for a fair comparison we
must note that the concentration camp barrack includes a washroom and
toilets. When those are

<B></B>

taken out of consideration there remains
a space of 6,515 sq. ft. for 200 prisoners. At a height of 9 ft. this
yields 58,650 cu. ft., or 293 cu. ft. per inmate. That is almost sixfold
the space allocated to the Soviet <I>Untermensch.</I> To prevent any
misconception: if we compare the 293 cu. ft. allocated to a hypothetical
European inmate with the 400 cu. ft. allocated to a guard (see previous
paragraph) we must bear in mind that the latter number refers only to
the guard's sleeping accommodation, while the 293 cu. ft. is the total
living space of the inmate. To continue the comparison: the huts in
Birkenau provided 181 sq. ft. of window surface for 744 prisoners, or
0.25 sq. ft. per inmate, while the standard concentration-camp barrack
provided eighteen times as much light. The melancholy comparison can
be applied to every aspect of the design. In Birkenau the toilets and
washrooms were housed in sixteen wash barracks and eighteen latrines;
that is, one wash barrack per 7,800 inmates, and one latrine hut per
7,000 inmates. Each hut had a surface of 1,745 sq. ft.; that is, a little
more than 0.2 sq. ft. per inmate. The standard concentration-camp hut
provides 4.9 sq. ft. of wash space per inmate, almost twenty times as
much. Toilet space in the standard camp was less generous at only 2.5
sq. ft. per inmate--but still more than twelve times as much as was
allocated to the Soviet <I>Untermensch.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The design of the wash barracks and privies is paradoxically "symbolic"
of the fundamentally asymbolic situation of Birkenau.

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 106]</B>

Article
13 of the Geneva Convention required belligerents "to take all sanitary
measures necessary to assure the cleanliness and healthfulness
of camps and prevent epidemics." Prisoners were to "have at their
disposal, day and night, installations conforming to sanitary rules
and constantly maintained in a state of cleanliness." They were also
to "be furnished a sufficient quantity of water for the care of their
own bodily cleanliness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 This concern for the prisoners'
cleanliness was inspired by the fear of lice, the most common host of
the typhus virus. Lack of water, lack of soap, and insufficient change
of clothing allow lice to gain a foothold on the human body, and so
expose the prisoner population to a typhus epidemic. Yet there is also
another reason. It has to do with the fundamentally symbolic nature
of the consciousness of the self that makes us unable to live amidst
our own excrement. Julia Kristeva has labelled excrement the confusing
"abject" that is neither subject (me) nor object (that), "but not nothing
either. A 'Something' that I do not recognize as a thing. A weight of
meaninglessness, about which there is nothing insignificant, and which
crushes me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Excrement, so she believes, links us directly
to the child's separation from the mother, and with that to the origin
of a person's sense of identity. Describing defilement as the oldest
and most universal symbol of evil, Paul Ricoeur has come to the same
conclusion. Confronted with the excremental states of dirt, decay,
and rot, we feel "a threat which, beyond the threat of suffering and
death, aims at a diminution of existence, a loss of the personal core
of one's being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 In a masterly essay on life in the death
camps, the late Terrence Des Pres described what he termed as the camp's
"excremental assault" on the inmates. The camp's filth, he argued, was
the result of a deliberate policy to destroy the last vestiges of the
prisoner's sense of self-worth. It was not enough to kill the prisoners;
one had to kill them as totally broken people. Only when the inmates
were completely crushed would the SS "reach the orgasmic peak of their
potential domination...Spiritual destruction became an end in itself,
quite apart from the requirements of mass murder."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Des Pres
is incorrect in his insistence that defilement was the result of the
SS's desire to exercise total power. The root cause was a fundamental
inadequacy of design, a lack of willingness on the part of bureaucrats
far away from the camp to allocate more than a minimum of material
and financial resources for the camp's construction, and an assumption
about the camp's use that proved badly mistaken. Yet intended or not,
the result was the same: with the latrines submerged in excrement, with
very little water to be had at very few points, and with mud everywhere,
what remained was an inmate population without any means to preserve the
outward signs of human dignity. As Des Pres asked, "how much self-esteem
can one maintain, how readily can one respond to the needs of another, if
both stink, if both are caked with mud and feces?" (Des Pres, 60). This
excremental assault led to the same collapse of symbol and reality we
noted with regard to the 53 cu. ft. allocated to each prisoner. In the
extreme conditions of the camp, Des Pres reflected, the division between
"concrete existence" and "symbolic modes of being" disappeared. "Body and
spirit become the ground of each other, each bearing the other's need, the
other's sorrow, and each responds directly to the other's total condition"
(Des Pres, 65). The result was a situation in which "meaning no longer
exists above and beyond the world; it reenters concrete experience,
becomes immanent and invests each act and each moment with urgent depth"
(Des Pres, 69).

This, then, brings us back to the designs. Were they even competent,
given the situation? First, there is the spatial arrangement: the
"privy" meant to serve 7,000 inmates is a shed with a single concrete
open sewer, 118 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, without seats and with one long

<B></B>

beam as a back support (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig17.html">fig. 17</A>). The
design was adapted from a
model latrine for large units in winter quarters, and was first published
in a leaflet on wartime emergency construction (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig18.html">fig. 18</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Like the model latrine, the camp latrine pit could be accessed from
walkways at both sides. Neither in Auschwitz, nor in the model on which
it was based were the walkways connected; but in Auschwitz this proved
catastrophic, for each of the walkways was 118 ft. long. Both in the
built version and the model, access to the walkways was provided by
doors at each of the building's short sides. Imagine 7,000 inmates at
sunrise, suffering from diarrhea or dysentery, and trying to enter, find
an unoccupied place, defecate, manage not to fall into the sewer, and
get out in the ten minutes or so allocated by the camp's regulations
to such necessities. Assuming that 150 inmates could find a place
at one time, and also assuming that all 7,000 inmates were to move
their bowels with the requisite precision, it would require forty-six
successive "seatings," with all the traffic jams involved. To be sure,
the design might have provided a series of doors on the long sides,
like the old English commuter trains used to have, and so accelerated
matters significantly; but the basic problem would have remained. One
sewer, supplied with an anemic supply of water and a drop of only 1.6
percent could never flush the discharge of 7,000 people in such a short
time. The result was a secretory catastrophe. Added to that were omissions
in the Auschwitz version that made the whole experience considerably more
unpleasant. First, there were no seats. Second, the system of support was
based on the minimal design of the field latrine, only to be used at the
front. Third, the "shame-walls" were removed, which might have provided
at least some physical privacy for those who had to defecate next to each
other. Finally, the separate aeration for the pit was omitted (it had
become superfluous since the pits at Auschwitz were open), which meant an
insufferable stench. Gisella Perl, who was forced to use these latrines
after <I>BA I</I> had become the women's camp of Birkenau, gives us a
succinct description of the situation delineated in Drawing 795 :

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There was one latrine for thirty to thirty-two thousand women and we were
permitted to use it only at certain hours of the day. We stood in line
to get into this tiny building, knee-deep in human excrement. As we all
suffered from dysentery, we could rarely wait until our turn came, and
soiled our ragged clothes, which never came off our bodies, thus adding
to the horror of our existence by the terrible smell which surrounded
us like a cloud.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Added to this was the indignity of the arrangement itself: "The
latrine consisted of a deep ditch with planks thrown across it at
certain intervals. We squatted on these planks like birds perched on
a telegraph wire, so close together that we could not help soiling one
another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No explanation can justify or qualify the horror of these provisions. We
have seen how decisions about the design were framed by a general
ideology that assigned the Soviet prisoner of war the lowly status
of <I>Untermensch.</I> But there was also another reason why Ertl and
Bischoff thought that they could get away with less than the absolute
minimum, a reason explained in one document discussing the intended
capacity of the waste-water treatment plant at Birkenau. Originally
the camp had been conceived as a base for crews of slave workers who
were to be employed in amelioration and construction activities in the
surrounding area. As it was to be largely empty during the day, the
architects reasoned that even when the camp was filled to capacity, it
would be possible to run it with only 66 percent of the minimum sanitary
facilities, for prisoners could be serviced by locally dug field latrines

<B></B>

at their place of work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 The reasoning was mistaken, for
it entirely neglected the question of peak use in the early morning and
evening, when all the prisoners had to use the facilities simultaneously.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mistake made the lives of the inmates insufferable. Remarkably, it
also created huge problems for the SS. As we have seen, as early as 1
March 1941 provincial officials had noted that the camp's sewage was
going to create problems. Himmler had dismissed their concerns then,
and he dismissed them again later. Bischoff, characterized by an SS
psychologist as a man who was servile towards his superiors, troublesome
to his colleagues, and tyrannical to his subordinates, was not going
to make trouble about it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Facing serious shortages in
material and manpower, the architect callously reasoned that the camp was
temporary and that the inmates were going to be working outside during
the day: why not dump the camp's sewage directly into the Vistula? In
the first brief for the camp, he had projected three sewers to take the
waste water from the camp to an open channel directly connected to the
Vistula. No screens, sedimentation basins, or other cleansing units
were planned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 The total budget was RM 250,000, that is,
2.8 percent of a budget of almost RM 9 million.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But even this minimal arrangement was not realized. Bischoff blamed a
lack of prisoners to dig the trenches.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 The inmates were
not Bischoff's only headache. The local and provincial planners created
trouble from the moment that they received Bischoff's proposals. In
early February 1942 the provincial chief of construction,

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 110]</B>

Wittmer, predicted that sewage would leak from the open channels into
the surrounding area and argued that a flood, which was a distinct
possibility in the lowland around Birkenau, would lead to severe
pollution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Provincial planner Ziegler concluded that
enough was enough, and that it was time to remind Himmler of his
responsibilities. In a letter of 18 February 1942 he reminded the
<I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I> that "when I gave my permission some time
ago to create a concentration camp I made it clear that a camp of this
enormous size, located in such an extraordinarily well situated place for
industry (close to coal, at a major road and railway junction, and at the
confluence of three rivers), will be expected to accept many conditions
in the interest of other parties or for the common good." He noted that
H&ouml;ss had always understood this, and that therefore there had been
no problems until then.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ziegler's letter alarmed the SS headquarters; despite appearances, the SS
was not omni-potent, and while they certainly had total control over what
happened within their camps once they were built, they also had to adhere
to normal planning procedures and, if necessary, inspections, while the
camps were under construction. Ziegler had the power to stop the expansion
of Auschwitz. Hence the SS main office instructed Bischoff to draw up a
new plan for the camp's waste-water management which would satisfy the
province. Within a week it was completed. For a total expenditure of RM
424,000 Auschwitz-Birkenau would receive a seven-branch sewer that was
to have a total length of 1 mile (RM 52,000), three sedimentation basins
(RM 205,500), a separate draining system of pipes which connected to a
collection pipe for a total length of 9 miles (RM 117,000) and, finally,
a 0.7 mile-long open channel to discharge the effluent into the Vistula
(RM 49,500).
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But paper is patient, and little was done. The spring came, and the
summer, and the camp continued to expand, and more and more sewage
flowed untreated into the Vistula, and relations between the town, the
province, and the camp steadily worsened. Finally, on 23 September,
the parties came together to settle their differences. It was the same
meeting in which the SS yielded on the issue of Hartjenstein's Garden
City: with sewage spilling into the rivers, Oswald Pohl needed to give
in somewhere--especially as he lacked the resources to install a system
capable of dealing with the waste that the camp produced. When the sewage
came up as the last point of the agenda, Pohl chose to humbug his way
through the issue. The municipal and provincial bureaucrats, who had just
won an important victory concerning the relocation of the SS settlement,
allowed him to get away with it. All agreed that the matter needed the
special attention of Himmler, and that they would meet again in the near
future to resolve the sewage problem.

Thus began a period in which the creation of various provisional and
more sophisticated sewage treatment plants became a major obsession in
the Auschwitz <I>Zentralbauleitung</I> (Central Construction Office)
(<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig19.html">fig. 19</A>). Designs became more intricate
and technologically advanced,
but work on the ground progressed slowly. Only in July 1943 was Bischoff
able to complete the first provisional sedimentation basin just south
of the recently completed Crematory II (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig20.html">fig. 20</A>). This was to service
<I>BA I</I> of Auschwitz-Birkenau, which had already been completed a year
earlier. Because it was located adjacent to the crematory at the windward
side of the camp, the basin only sharpened the all-pervasive excremental
stench of the place. Progress on the provisional treatment facilities of
<I>BA II,</I> north of Crematory III, was slow, as there were no guards
to oversee the prisoners assigned to dig the channels.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 When
Pohl visited the camp on 17 August 1943 the completion of the sewage
plants was the

<B></B>

central topic of discussion. Bischoff explained
that one of the difficulties in constructing the system was the lack
of guards to oversee the prisoners: the treatment facilities had been
planned outside the camp's barbed wire fence, and the channels that had
to be dug ran for more than three miles through lightly guarded terrain. A
massive deployment of prisoners, needed to complete the project that year,
would be possible only if the camp could provide a steady and predictable
supply of guards. Knowing that Bischoff was hysterical on the issue of
prisoner labor, Pohl decided to see the site for himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 He
must have urged the camp to heed Bischoff's request, because for several
weeks a great deal of work was done. But by mid-September the supply of
guards started to dry up, and progress was halted.

Bischoff's inability to complete the sewers because of the lack of guards
points to what was perhaps the greatest fallacy of Himmler's original
proposal to use slave-labor to build up the German East. Himmler had been
inspired by two precedents: the <I>Reichsarbeitsdienst</I> (Reich Labor
Service) and the Soviet Gulag. The Reich Labor Service, which had become
manda-tory on 26 June 1935, had been established to do exactly the kind of
work that Himmler expected from slave labor. By 1937 the programs of the
<I>Reichsarbeitsdienst</I> affected one fifth of Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The
organization was involved in the reclamation of marshes, the draining and
irrigation of underdeveloped land, the concentration of fragmented farm
properties, the protection of lowlands by dikes, and the reclamation of
land from the sea. But the men of the Labor Service worked with minimal
supervision. They did not need guards. They took pride in their work. And
the hundreds of thousands of prisoners within the Soviet Gulag worked most
often in desolate areas in which an escape from the camp meant certain
death in the wilderness. Himmler, however, had to deploy his slave labor
(<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig21.html">fig. 21</A>) in a highly developed
environment and, as the war continued,
with dwindling manpower to guard them. Birkenau's original purpose had
been unattainable from its inception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This brings us to the camp's transformation from a prisoner-of war-camp
into a concen-tration camp for Jews. I will neither analyze nor seek
to explain this transformation, but limit myself to recording some
facts. From the moment of their arrival the Soviet prisoners of war, who
were supposed to build their own accommodations, had died more rapidly
than the SS expected. H&ouml;ss recalled how "the situation became
really terrible during the muddy period in the winter of 1941-42. They
could bear the cold, but not the dampness and wearing clothes that were
always wet. This, together with the primitive, half-finished, hastily
thrown-together barracks at the start of Camp Birkenau caused the death
rate steadily to climb" (H&ouml;ss, 133). Snow began to fall at the end
of November. H&ouml;ss sent a report to Berlin indicating a catastrophic
situation. In response Kammler phoned Bischoff on 3 December, and demanded
a full report within twenty-four hours. Bischoff's statement introduced
the bad news with some statistics meant to impress on Kammler the extent
of his progress until now: in just over a month 140,000 cu. ft. of earth
had been moved, 1,600 concrete foundations had been poured, and 86,000
cu. ft. of brick work had been erected, using 1.1 million bricks. Further,
600 concrete posts had been erected for the fence, and 100,000 stretching
ft. of barbed wire had been put into place. The bad news was that only
two of the huts in BA I had been completed, twelve had been provisionally
enclosed, seven were advanced enough that work could begin on the girders,
and nine already had walls under construction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<b>[Begin Page 114]</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major reason for the slow progress was that the Russians had not
been supplied with building materials. Bischoff's original brief,
drafted in October, had mentioned that "the barracks will be for the
greatest part built from brick as there is no wood available and the
material will be partly derived from the demolition of the hamlet of
Birkenau."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Thus the first batch of Soviet prisoners of war
were told to cannibalize the village; they had already been brought to
the point of cannibalizing each other, as H&ouml;ss later admitted when
recalling this early period in the history of the camp:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Cases of cannibalism happened quite often in Birkenau. Once I found the
body of a Russian lying between two piles of bricks. The body had been
ripped open with a dull instrument. The liver was missing. They beat each
other to death just to get something to eat...During the levelling of the
land and the trench-digging in the first section of Birkenau <I>[BA
I],</I> the men discovered several corpses of Russians apparently
beaten to
death and partially eaten...[The Soviets] had become animals who looked
for only one thing, food. (H&ouml;ss, 133f.)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only did SS overseers withhold materials from the subhumans, they
also furnished no tools to cannibalize the houses in Birkenau. They were
to be pulled down with bare hands, and the barracks built likewise. This
contributed to the high mortality rate during construction. In the month
of October, 1,255 Soviets died; in November, 3,726; in December, 1,912;
and in January, 1,017. By the end of January almost 8,000 of the 10,000
men had died, which translates into a mortality rate of 240 percent per
year. One more month would suffice to kill the remaining 2,000.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The SS now began to look for a new source of labor. On 26 January
1942 Himmler com-municated his new plans to the inspector of all the
concentration camps, Richard Gl&uuml;cks. "As Russian prisoners of war
are not expected in the near future," Gl&uuml;cks was to take charge
of the "large number of Jews and Jewesses who are being emigrated
from Germany, and send them to the camps...During the next few weeks,
prepare to receive 100,000 male Jews and up to 50,000 Jewesses in the
concentration camps. Large-scale tasks and assignments will come to
the concentration camps in the next few weeks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Himmler's
communication spelt more doom than might at first appear. The Jews were
not to be housed in a concentration camp set up according to Kammler's
guidelines, but in Bischoff's infinitely more primitive prisoner-of-war
camp in Birkenau. Three years and one day after Himmler's telegram the
Soviet Army liberated Auschwitz. Early Soviet estimates put the number
of people killed in those three years at close to four million. Today
we believe that the number is more like one million.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>"Geographical Situation.</I> Auschwitz is located in the midst of a
fertile, loessial landscape that stretches between the Beskid Mountains
in the south and the Upper Silesian hills in the north. The loessial
terrace, which drops almost ten meters where it reaches the flood plain
of the Vistula, pushes toward Auschwitz far to the north. At the point
where the Vistula regains its eastern direction after having run north
for some time, there was once a natural ford just

<B></B>

above the meeting
place of the [tributary rivers] Sola and Pzemsa with the river Vistula,
while the terrace that offered steep slopes on three sides offered a
point of departure for the thirteenth-century German foundation of a
town in the shadow of a ducal castle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Natural Traffic Situation.</I> At Auschwitz the roads that come
southwest from the Moravian Gate and south from the Beskid Mountains
through the Sola valley meet the world trade route that connects the
North Sea to the Black Sea.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Location.</I> Today, Auschwitz is also a place where many important
roads and railroads meet ...Its location is determined not only by the
fact that Auschwitz is a central place in the region, but also by its
good traffic location within the larger space. That is to say, Auschwitz
occupies more or less the center of the Moravian, the Upper Silesian and
the Polish indust-rial areas. Also significant is its location at the
immediate periphery of the Upper Silesian coal mining area. The choice
of this site as a location for large industries is made feasible by the
presence of an almost flat, large, dry loessial terrace of more than two
hundred acres that can be developed, and the bountiful supply of water
in the Vistula valley.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Population.</I> The present population situation in Auschwitz
(Administrative District) is as follows:

<I>Population Planning.</I> Because of the importance of the location,
the future population has been set at 35,500 people, in addition to
which there will be two reserve areas for 11,500 people, creating a
total potential population of:

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
47,000 inhabitants.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thereby we assume the following division of the population:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Percentage of people employable (after Rechenberg): 55% of the
population. Hence 35,500 x 55% = approximately 19,500 employable people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Percentage of this number employed to service the town and its region: 45%
of the employable people (minimum according to Rechenberg 35%, increased
because of the town's position as a central place in an otherwise rural
area, with important traffic functions--government, trade, traffic,
crafts, small industries. Hence 19,500 x 45% = local significance: 8,800.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Number of workers in the large industries: Buna [the IG Farben
plant]--3,000; rolling mill--600; other--400. Total = 4,000.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Railways and ancillary businesses = 1,500.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SS and ancillary businesses (but not the barracks and the concentration
camp inmates)

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
500 settlers x 3 = 1,500.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reserve and otherwise employed = 3,700

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Total employed (8,800 + 4,000 + 1,500 + 1,500 + 3,700) = 19,500

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Space Needs of Settlement.</I> In the enlarged municipal area we aim

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This suggests an average land use of 200 m<SUP>2</SUP>
 per house,
according to the land-use tables developed by Rosenberg; the population
density of 115 inhabitants per hectare is, according to my own research,
an average for a mixed, generally two-story, open and continuous
arrangement with streets in between, lined by three-story buildings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Planning of Districts.</I> The point of departure for general planning
has been the assumption that the only area suitable to large industry
is the zone located east of the town--at the town's leeside--south of
Dwory. A natural area for human settlement is offered by the nearly flat
and dry terrace, which stretches west of the town and immediately adjacent
to it. On the basis of considerations for safety from bombardments, the
settlement area is separated from the industrial area by a depression
of 500m. This area must be developed as a park-like green belt.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is all the available space than can be used for settlement
immediately adjacent to the existing town core.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The existing urban area is constructed around the medieval core, which
will be preserved with its <I>Ring.</I> It will serve in first instance
as the center of government and commerce.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, a natural expansion of the town can occur in the adjacent
area between the sta-tion and the Sola. Because relocation of the
station is impossible, this area is the only pos-sible...zone for city
expansion. This will lead to the creation of an organic connection
between the city as a whole and the station, of which the main hall will
be pushed 300m east in order to create a new station square with a post
office, a hotel and similar amenities. This expansion settlement area,
which will be able to house 10,000 people, will also give space for
the SS settlement and a settlement for railroad employees, each with
500 houses, with in total 2 x 500 x 4.5 = 4,500 inhabitants. The part
of this area that is located north of the

<B></B>

through road will be
reserved for light industries...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Separated by a green belt from the settlement area adjacent to the
station is an area of 35 ha for the SS base, which at its northwest
corner touches on the existing mill.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another green belt separates the SS base from the concentration camp
proper, which is approximately 150 ha in size. The agricultural areas
that are necessary for the purposes of the camp are defined in such a
way that the organic development of the town will not be obstructed and
no important road connections will be interrupted. For the rest it is
assumed that the rivers Sola and Vistula will be the natural borders
[of the concentration camp area].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As small industries can be located in the settlement area at appropriate
locations, a further industrial area has not been planned. If necessary
at a later date, one might consider creating another industrial area west
of the station, stretching west toward the Vistula. The establish-ment
of SS industrial installations might begin there, and, because of this
possibility, a long-term agricultural development should be avoided in
that location.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Traffic Planning.</I> At the railroad an expansion of the station is
foreseen...The spine of the traffic within the town will be defined by
the narrowly shaped connector that links the station, crosses over the
existing Sola bridge, and passes through a cut in the old town to the
settlement area of East Auschwitz. Also at the town core will be a new
<I>Ring</I> that will be a center for government, party, and community
buildings. This area will be connected to the regional road to the
north and a small railway station. The industrial road will continue
east through a park-like green belt to the place where the main gate
and the industrial offices will be located...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Free Areas and Recreation.</I> The valleys of the Sola and the Vistula
with their borders shall be kept free. The flood plain south of the town
will become dry even during periods of flooding after flood controls
around the Sola have been completed, and can hence be used for sports
facilities and small gardens. A cemetery that can be expanded, with an
immediate surface of 35,500 inhabitants x 3m<SUP>2</SUP>
 = 10 ha, is
also foreseen. Because of the new bridge over the Vistula the forest at
Bobrek and Chelm can be easily reached.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Water and Sewage Treatment.</I> An area in the Sola valley has been
designated as a water control zone...An area has been allocated for
sewage treatment, but we must still decide on measures to protect it
from floods."
