<i>White Christmas</i> (Michael Curtiz, USA, 1954) is usually known as just another contributor to the white noise of the holiday season. An ineluctable feature of the holiday landscape, its excessive visibility has rendered it invisible to criticism. The film has not been the subject of any serious scholarship&#x02014;either on the genre of the musical or on Michael Curtiz, its director. In the three major monographs on Curtiz, <i>White Christmas</i> only merits a single paragraph in the most recent by James Robertson, who dismisses the film as "a glossy Vistavision [sic] reworking of Mark Sandrich's 1942 <i>Holiday Inn</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  True, <i>White Christmas</i> was the director's 167th film and has to be situated within an oeuvre that includes <i>Casablanca</i> (1942, USA), <i>Mildred Pierce</i> (1945, USA) and <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i> (1942, USA). Yet the slighting of <i>White Christmas</i> by later historians and critics seems odd for a number of reasons. Most importantly, the film was not just another "glossy Vistavision reworking" of another holiday classic. It was actually the <i>first</i> VistaVision [note uppercase V] film to be produced by Paramount Studios. It was also extraordinarily successful: it was the highest grossing film of 1954, the year it was released, making some twelve million dollars, and it has continued to be a money-spinner ever since. Yet despite its industrial specificity and its ubiquity, the film has not red importantly in recent scholarship on widescreen production and exhibition practices.
</p>

<p>
Of course, not every film&#x02014;not even one that enjoyed spectacular financial success&#x02014;deserves serious exegesis. But <i>White Christmas</i>'s status as the first VistaVision film ever made gives it an emblematic place in film history at a critical moment, the period when the studio system was being redefined and Hollywood 

<b></b>

was battling to gain back viewers lost to television and other leisurely post-war pursuits. <i>White Christmas</i> compels our attention because it so manifestly visualizes and materializes the historical conditions under which it was produced. Like most backstage musicals, <i>White Christmas</i> exhibits a requisite, almost knee-jerk reflexivity. But that reflexivity is impressive both because it constitutes a self-consciousness about the film's generic conventions, and because it broods on the film's conditions of industrial manufacture and consumption, in this film's case the VistaVision mode of production and exhibition.
</p>

<p>
Jane Feuer has argued that the reflexivity typical of the Hollywood musical serves primarily to bolster the genre's legitimacy and ensure its viability. With the studio system's decline, such reflexivity underwent a process of mutation. What Feuer calls "late genre" films produced in the "late" or "post studio" era (from the late 1940s onward) tend toward "critical reflexivity," a mode in which the films "systematically deconstruct those very elements that give the genre its regularity."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  These "critically reflexive" musicals, Feuer claims, are "modernist" (though she offers the term in quotation marks).
</p>

<p>
To illustrate her notion of this new, modernist form of reflexivity, Feuer uses the George Cukor film <i>A Star Is Born</i>, released in 1954, the same year as <i>White Christmas</i>. She dwells on the long scene in which Judy Garland's character Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester rehearses a musical number from her new film before her husband Norman Maine (played by James Mason) in the comfort of the living room of their Malibu pleasure dome. In between breathlessly performing the song, Garland signals the scenic shifts that will occur in the finished film: "Now I'm at the top of the Eiffel Tower! . . . Now I'm in China!" The scene is a raucous and sustained parody of the musical convention in which song and dance numbers are bodied forth spontaneously and fantastically. Garland's number, says Feuer, "systematically debunks the principle of the spontaneous generation of performance in musicals."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
<i>White Christmas</i> is not a debunking, deconstructive musical. Nor is it interested in demystifying the myth of spontaneous entertainment or questioning whether the musical was, in 1954, a viable genre. Quite the opposite, in fact: <i>White Christmas</i> nostalgically seeks to return its spectators to a rapt belief in the entertainments offered by the Hollywood musical. More importantly, the film also bears the burden of demonstrating its new technology, the VistaVision widescreen; its staging of its technological and historical significance and specificity takes place through the set design and the way that its actors are made to interact with its sets, especially in several of the film's spectacular dance numbers. No, <i>White Christmas</i> is not a modernist film; but it is a film preoccupied by modernism. Consider one of its central numbers, entitled "Choreography": dancers performing movements that are clearly meant to parody the work of Martha Graham are danced into submission by explosive tap dancing performed by Vera-Ellen. "Choreography," in which modernism is presented as a threat to the entertainment offered by the Hollywood musical, is not just another clich&#x000E9;d restaging of the quarrel between high art and mass art. It suggests a heuristic approach for studying the status of modernism in Hollywood, at a moment when significant examples of Hollywood 

<b></b>

genre filmmaking were operating explicitly, in Feuer's understanding and mine, within a mode of modernism. <i>White Christmas</i>'s VistaVision cinematography, I shall argue, red a technologically progressive but ideologically conservative attempt to retake ground lost by traditional Hollywood genre films. This lost ground was both financial (the result of declining ticket sales) and ideological (a loss of the innocent belief in the values proposed by genres like the musical). The expanded image of VistaVision gives us not only a bigger picture onscreen, but also a clearer image of the contradictions and tensions that characterized significant examples of Hollywood genre production in the post-war period and their relationship to the culture of modernism.

<p class="noIndent">
John Belton's indispensable study <i>Widescreen Cinema</i> provides an exhaustively thorough history of widescreen production and exhibition from the earliest days of the cinema, up until the end of the twentieth century. Interest in and experimentation with wide screen formats is almost as old as the cinema itself. Belton details the fascinating and byzantine history of widescreen processes, paying particular attention to the industrial and entrepreneurial labor that went into the proliferation of widescreen cinema in the post World War II period, during which Hollywood ticket sales declined steeply. VistaVision was the Paramount studio's answer to the widescreen question, simply one technological alternative among an array of others that included CinemaScope, Cinerama, Natural Vision, SuperScope, and Todd-AO. I wish here to recapitulate the conditions that were to give rise to widescreen cinema, then to explain the VistaVision process and the considerations that led to <i>White Christmas</i> being used as the vehicle for the debut of the technology.
</p>

<p>
The decline in box office revenues in the post-war period was decisive in encouraging film studios to invent ways of luring spectators back to the cinemas. The causes of decline in movie attendance are well known, but can stand brief recapitulation here. Average weekly attendance at the cinema in the United States reached ninety million. But by 1952 this number had slipped to fifty one million&#x02014;in other words, attendance had declined by over forty per cent in less than five years.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Numerous historians have linked this decline to shifts in post-war culture that are familiar to everyone, yet worth recalling. Most significant of these, in terms of its impact on film attendance, was a redefinition of domestic life effected by rapid acceleration in the use of two technologies: the automobile and the television. The rapid increase in automobile ownership enabled many formerly urban members of the middle and lower middle classes to move to the suburbs. The post-war years witnessed the privileging of the suburban home as a site of recreation, particularly recreation centered around the television. Whereas urbanites might previously have gone out to the cinema for an evening's entertainment, the new suburbanites often preferred to stay at home, thus depriving the old movie houses of their regular audiences. And the car, in addition to its primary use as a means of commuting, began also to be deployed as a recreational technology in connection with the incipient practice of the day and weekend trip.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For spectators to be lured back to the cinema, so the studios' thinking went, they would have to be offered something they could not get at home. Chiefly, this something was the pleasure of the large, color image, beside which the flickering black and white images of the television screen seemed a very poor relation. Cinema had to emphasize its unparalleled spectacularity, its specificity&#x02014;had to recall for its spectators an awareness of itself as an event. Widescreen formats, it was hoped, would perform this labor of seduction.
</p>

<p>
VistaVision was the Paramount studio's approach to this project of the "re-enchantment" of cinema. Twentieth Century-Fox introduced CinemaScope in 1953 with <i>The Robe</i> (Henry Koster, USA), a biblical epic starring Richard Burton. The advertising for the film billed it as "The first motion picture in CinemaScope&#x02014;the miracle you can see without glasses!" The glasses bit is a swipe at 3-D processes like that of MGM, which required spectators to don little spectacles to appreciate the spatial illusion of three-dimensionality. Despite this lack of a physical encumbrance for the spectator, CinemaScope was cumbersome to produce and exhibit. Its larger aspect ratio of 2.66:1 (compared to the standard 1.33:1) had to be produced using anamorphic lenses during shooting and projection. The necessity of the anamorphic lens meant exhibitors had to invest in new hardware, including ideally new, curved screens, in order to accommodate the new films. Aesthetically, despite the stunning new dimensions of the CinemaScope image, the process also had the disadvantage of appearing rather grainy, due to the fact that the image was essentially blown up by the anamorphic projection lens.
</p>

<p>
This thumbnail history of CinemaScope is necessary to understand the subsequent appearance of VistaVision. While other studios decided to purchase from Twentieth Century-Fox the rights to use this technology, Paramount held out, opting instead to return to an invention it had acquired the patent for in 1926, almost thirty years earlier.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The VistaVision image was produced by exposing the negative horizontally and then rotating it 90 degrees and reducing it to standard 35mm in the printing process. This produced a projected image that was longer and higher than traditional formats, with an aspect ratio that could range from 1.85:1 to 2:1. Though the image did not have the same panoramic breadth as CinemaScope, the image, because it had not been blown up anamorphically, was sharper and denser. Furthermore, exhibitors could project VistaVision with existing projection equipment.
</p>

<p>
In the discursive war of widescreen aesthetics, Paramount made much of VistaVision's extraordinary width <i>and</i> height and of the fact that the image did not suffer the loss of clarity and depth of field that were casualties of CinemaScope and other widescreen processes. While VistaVision could not actually provide the width of CinemaScope, Paramount sought to emphasize, in its promotional materials, that "height was equally important as width."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This interest in height is signaled even by the VistaVision logo, with the exaggerated elongation of the second V, which clearly signifies this notion of height (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).
</p>

<p>
Paramount's decision to debut VistaVision with <i>White Christmas</i> was in many ways an odd one. The film is a backstage (or "show") musical about two soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who meet in the European theater in 

<b></b>

World War II. Bob is already a successful entertainer; Phil talks his way into becoming Bob's sidekick in the post-war years. The two meet a pair of less successful singing sisters, Betty and Judy Haynes (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen), and follow them to a Vermont inn where the sisters have a Christmas gig. Once there, Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their commanding officer from World War II, General Waverly.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The General, visibly ashamed by the emasculating nature of his job, is further disgraced by impending financial ruin (a lack of snowfall in Vermont has kept visitors away from his inn). Bob and Phil and the Haynes sisters hatch a plan to put on a show at the inn to save the General. The usual generic obstacles ensue, but the usual generic happy denouement is achieved. </p>

We might think that the high and wide VistaVision image would have lent itself better to a movie set outdoors, maybe on the ski slopes, rather than the inside of a ski lodge. In fact, early tests for the technology were shot out of doors, in urban locations, so as to test the process against the demands of the dimensions of landscape. This idea that VistaVision should be used to photograph landscape seems to have lingered as an anxiety, for <i>VistaVision Visits Norway</i>, a short two-reel film, traveled with <i>White Christmas</i> in the theaters&#x02014;perhaps as a kind of insurance policy, or else as a message to spectators that Paramount really had a handle on the technology they were peddling.
</p>

<p>
However, the backstage musical seems to have afforded a different set of possibilities for exploring the enhanced dimensions of VistaVision. The genre implicitly emphasizes 

<b></b>

the theatrical and reflexive nature of its location, the site of performance&#x02014;the proscenium, the audience and, of course, the actual backstage that gives the sub-genre its name. The controlled conditions of this genre encourage, therefore, the show within the film to be staged in such a way that all of the increased dimensions and capacities of the VistaVision image are explored. <i>White Christmas</i> has the busiest and most expansive of mise-en-sc&#x000E9;nes: tap dancers descending from offscreen space above the frame, or else being hurled up into the image from below; a cavernous performance hall with a seemingly unlimited seating capacity and a proscenium stage capable of expanding magically in size that furthermore, in the film's last scene, opens onto a (clearly artificial) snowy (at last) landscape. Far from being a misuse of VistaVision technology, <i>White Christmas</i> seems more like an efficient clinical laboratory for testing its possibilities minutely.
</p>

<p>
The laboratory conditions of <i>White Christmas</i> can be sensed in the film's reflexive foregrounding of its sets. But before spectators were able see these sets for themselves, they were primed to pay attention to the film's emphasis on set design. In the film's pressbook, a marketing handbook for exhibitors formatted to look like a newspaper, one of the "articles" declares:"Some of the sets for 'White Christmas' were among the most elaborate ever built in Hollywood. Lavish night club interiors and the Vermont inn, complete with landscaping and barns, are outstanding examples of the time and money put into making the film one of the biggest in the history of the motion picture industry."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The article, of course, trumpets the use of VistaVision in anthropomorphizing terms:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In addition to its human stars . . . Paramount's lavishly produced presentation of Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" . . . has a fifth star&#x02014;VistaVision. 
<p class="blockquote">
	This is the name given to the revolutionary new filming process which, when projected on the theater screen, gives such a clear image that even the background shots look as if they were only a few feet away from the viewer.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
To urge spectators, in the same breath, to recognize the splendor of VistaVision and the expenditure on set design, is to implicitly suggest that appreciation of the former is achieved by attention to the latter.
</p>

<p>
The film was indeed expensive, costing close to four million dollars. More than ten percent of this total budget was spent on set design. The interiors and exteriors of General Waverly's Columbia Inn, the location where most of film takes place, cost close to $100,000&#x02014;a spectacular amount of money (especially considering the price of an actual house in 1954).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Not willing to hedge its bets, Paramount also spent a staggering $800,000 promoting the film, including purchasing tie-ins on popular television programs.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The investment evidently paid off, because <i>White Christmas</i> became one of the highest grossing films in Paramount's history, as well as the highest grossing film of 1954, earning gross receipts of twelve million dollars.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The studio's gamble on VistaVision and <i>White Christmas</i> would seem to have been far- and clear-sighted (so to speak).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Critical reviews were rather lukewarm or else simply tongue-in-cheek. The reviewer for <i>Variety</i> was predictably optimistic about the picture as a whole, but looked forward to VistaVision being put to more spectacular uses: "The widescreen process has an impressive vastness, with color clarity and sharp definition that add greatly to the visual quality of a production. VV's impact, while giving a full-stage effect to this musical, should be even greater when applied to outdoor and action-drama stories."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The middle-brow press was less convinced. The reviewer for <i>The New Yorker</i> picks on the poor marriage of subject and film technology: "Another big musical job is something called 'White Christmas' . . . It . . . serves as an introduction to a process called VistaVision. This is designed to show even more of the outdoors than we've got accustomed to with Cinerama and CinemaScope; paradoxically, many of the scenes here are indoors. But wider, higher, deeper, or how you will, 'White Christmas' is a bore."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  John O'Hara, writing in <i>Colliers</i>, was more wilting:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>White Christmas</i> is photographed and projected in one of the new panoramic processes, this one called VistaVision. I guess I have seen most of the wide-screen devices and I now have an opinion on them. They're all right if you want to show the Battle of Bull Run (first or second) and they would have been just fine for the moving-up sequences in <i>The Big Parade</i>, an excellent motion picture for its time. But in ordinary sequences, just between or among a few persons, they make the actors too big and you too small. You feel no participating intimacy and hence no sympathetic relationship with the characters.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
While the first two responses I cite above are impatient with <i>White Christmas</i> as a widescreen exercise, O'Hara's feeling of being "too small" in front of the image suggests that although, by his reckoning, the technology may have been misapplied here, nonetheless the enlarged image has made its dimensions felt.
</p>

<p>
The awareness of the screen's size, an awareness, in other words, of the cinematic means of production at the expense of narrative identification and absorption, sounds suspiciously like an experience belonging to the domain of modernism. As noted before, <i>White Christmas</i> is not a modernist text; its auto-referentiality does not arrive at Feuer's "critical reflexivity." However, its production at a moment when a variety of practices recognized as modernist were entering the mainstream of U.S. cultural life, taken together with its privileging of its own manufacture through its mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne, requires that we think more closely about what this film, which could justifiably be written off as the crassest of Hollywood products, might have to do with the means and aims of modernist aesthetic practice.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Furthermore, that question becomes more pressing when we pay attention to a nearly hysterical anti-modernist discourse that lies at the very center of the film's diegesis. At this point I wish to turn to the film proper in order to analyze more closely the function of its sets and the movement of the actors' bodies within them, deployed as a means of drawing attention to the purely formal properties of VistaVision cinema, and to further consider what this formal mapping has to do with the film's anti-modernist discourse.

Set Design, Dance and Anti-modernism
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
At several key moments the film draws lavish attention to its set design and forces a particular awareness of the artificiality of the sets as sets. The film opens with a musical Christmas Eve review being staged by Bob and Phil (again, Crosby and Kaye) somewhere at the European front in World War II. These opening scenes refer, obviously, back to the "source" of <i>White Christmas</i>&#x02014;1942's <i>Holiday Inn</i>, which saw yuletide sentimentality as the flipside of wartime patriotism.
</p>

<p>
Immediately following the credits, a painted backdrop occupies the full plane of the image, initially with the words "Christmas Eve 1944" superimposed over it. The backdrop depicts a typical New England landscape: in the middle of a snow-clad valley, a few wood-frame houses are presided over by a white-steepled church. We recognize the scene's falseness, but are also aware that we are being asked to accept this conventional representation of landscape as real. Such a practice of suspending scenographic disbelief is, after all, familiar to the spectator of classical Hollywood filmmaking. As the camera pulls back, however, this backdrop is revealed to be what we already knew it to be: an artificial piece of set design, with Bob and Phil performing a little song and dance routine in front of it. As the camera continues to withdraw from the backdrop, we are given to realize that this stage is set amid the ruins of a city, charred hulls of buildings towering to the side and in the background, soldiers seated before the stage, clapping in time to the music. The whole amounts to a deeply generic representation of "war-torn Europe." The larger set, however, within which the painted backdrop becomes only a tiny feature, does not ultimately pretend to be any more real than the backdrop, but rather (in all its fussy detail, in the unreal hues of its nighttime sky) seems openly to declare the film's investment in artifice, and in particular in the artifice of the set itself <i>as set</i>. In terms of detail, depth, width and height, the clarity of this set is meant to show off the capacities of VistaVision. An abandoned idea for the opening credit sequence would have pushed the reflexive attention to set design even more blatantly: miniatures of the various sets in the movie were to have been built and photographed as background to the credits.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This device of emphasizing the background and mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne reappears throughout the film. Later, when Bob and Phil and the Haynes sisters are en route from Florida to Vermont in the dining car of a train, they break out into the song "Snow" (an example of how to stretch a really thin idea for a musical set-piece into an entire meta-representational exercise). At the same time the film essays an impromptu piece of set design: as the characters sing of snow, the camera observes in close up a white napkin and bits of a decorative pine tree that had decorated the table, an inprovisatory allusion to the same snowy New England landscape suggested earlier by the backdrop. In this instance the film seems to foreground the missing real scenery that should have been the proper subject of VistaVision technology (recall <i>VistaVision Visits Norway</i>). The production files from Paramount also reveal that this number, "Snow," was a last-minute-ish interpolation that replaced what should have been the "Winter Fantasia"&#x02014;a kind of spectacular dream sequence, ultimately deemed too expensive to shoot (but too expensive because of the expenditures already incurred in building the film's 

<b></b>

elaborate sets).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This table-top winter fantasia gestures obliquely to the re-shuffling of the film's budget, while also redirecting attention to budgetary expenditure on the sets of the Vermont Inn.
</p>

<p>
In fact, although all backstage musicals self-consciously display the effort required to mount a production, <i>White Christmas</i> draws an extraordinary degree of attention to the labor that has gone into its set-design. Inside the performance hall at the Columbia Inn, while the dancers are rehearsing, we hear the show's set-construction crew talking their trade ("Move that lumber over fellas!"). The labor of the performers and that of the set-designers are placed, momentarily, on the same plane of significance. Certainly the interiors of the inn are among the most spectacular in the film. The enormous height of the dinner theater and the dimensions of its stage are repeatedly insisted upon once the action arrives there. It is here, finally, that we are also made aware of the pressing historical context of declining movie ticket revenues that VistaVision was meant to reverse.
</p>

<p>
Due to a lack of snow since Thanksgiving, so the film tells us, General Waverly's inn has suffered a terrible decline in visitors. The giant, cavernous space of the inn's theater is clearly an analogue of the empty(ing or emptier) movie palaces across the U.S. The production staged by Bob and Phil is meant to correct this decline in visitors just as <i>White Christmas</i> was meant to do for Paramount. At the end of the "minstrel number" we see the film visualizing the historical conditions of the wide screen moment: as the spectacular number draws to a close, with Vera-Ellen's movement up and down the stage clearly charting the dimensions of the expanded image, the film cuts to the rehearsal audience (the general, his granddaughter, and nosy housekeeper), the empty theater extending into the gloom behind them. It will be precisely the spectacle of <i>White Christmas</i> that will fill this empty theater and its analogical double in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Curiously, though, this refilling of the auditorium, this summoning of spectators from their living rooms and televisions to the site of widescreen exhibition, is actually predicated <i>through</i> television. Bob makes his appeal to the members of General Waverley's troops to make a surprise visit to the Columbia Inn on Christmas Eve on the "Ed Harrison" show (read Ed Sullivan show, the most popular variety show of the time). In fact, it is precisely the distinguishing capabilities of television that are exploited by Bob to make his show at the Columbia Inn come off: the medium's immediacy; its existence as a part of the everyday life of its spectators; its ability to reach masses of people in different parts of the country, at the same moment in time. This diegetic exploitation of television in the service of the cinematic is clearly of a piece with the plugs for <i>White Christmas</i> that Paramount managed to air on several televised variety shows in the run-up to the film's release. This same deployment of television is actually visualized by the film itself when we see Bob's televised appeal to Waverley's troops as it is transmitted and watched on television monitors in Vermont and New York. Within the high and wide frame of the film's VistaVisual mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne, the black and white televisual image never looked more puny and impoverished.
</p>

<p>
In charting the film's layers of reflexivity, I do not intend to engage in what Fredric Jameson has called the "weak idealism" of interpreting the film as an allegory of its 

<b></b>

own mode of production, a hermeneutic mode in which the critic " . . . posits the auto-referentiality of the work's detail, so that its former content on inspection proves to be the way in which the work itself comments on its newfound camera mobility, or speaks of its wide screen by way of new forms of landscape . . . ."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  I do believe that part of the film's meaning can be apprehended in this manner, but understanding the film only as a reflexive allegory of itself does not do justice to its complexity.
</p>

<p>
Jameson agrees with Feuer's periodization of the 1950s as a moment characterized by what he calls the "belated" emergence of "sound-filmic" modernism ("EI," 183). He connects the emergent self-consciousness of film production at this moment to the wide screen phenomenon and the decline of the self-evident legitimacy of genre filmmaking: "The introduction of the 'wide screen' in 1952, with its overdetermined technological and economic situation (end of the studio system, introduction of television), is also emblematic of this mutation in aesthetics itself, which renders the modest on-going practice of the traditional genres somehow uncomfortable, if not intolerable" ("EI," 177). Jameson's characterization of this period might be criticized on a number of grounds. Film historians will protest that the wide screen was not "introduced" in 1952 (Jameson might have written "consolidation" rather than "introduction"). Furthermore, the studios decided to continue making genre films, particularly musicals, in part as a response to surveys indicating that these were the films people wanted to see. And the short-lived increase in ticket revenues in 1953 (for the first time since 1946) seems to have borne out, at least financially and momentarily, the wisdom of this decision.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Thus we wonder how "intolerable" the genre film was for either its producers or its spectators. Nonetheless, Jameson's essential point seems to me entirely correct: faced with a shift in aesthetics towards modernism, the genre film could not but reflect on itself with a self-consciousness that could justifiably be characterized as "uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
We witness such uncomfortable reflexivity in a scene that arrives almost exactly midway through the film. This is the rehearsal for the number called "Choreography," in which modern dance is unflatteringly pitted against tap dancing&#x02014;a Hollywood staging of the old quarrel between the ancients and moderns. The scene raises the issue of modernist aesthetic practice as constituting a threat to generic entertainment. It does so by forcing the dancers' bodies, in particular Judy's (Vera-Ellen's) and Johnny's (John Brascia's), to graph, through their movements, the dimensions of the VistaVision image.
</p>

<p>
"Choreography," as mentioned above, arrives almost exactly halfway into the film. Two major narrative events directly precede the number: First, Bob and Betty (Crosby and Clooney) convene over milk and sandwiches late at night in the performance hall. They cement their attraction to one another by doing a duet of "Count Your Blessings" and sharing a kiss. This scene is followed by one between Bob and General Waverly in which the General learns that the Army has rejected his request to rejoin active military service. This disappointment sets in motion Bob's aforementioned appearance on television to request that former members of the General's company attend the Christmas Eve spectacular that will be the film's finale.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  This same appearance on television constitutes the temporary obstacle to Bob and Betty's union at the film's end. 

<b></b>

Thus, these two scenes are central to the demands of the basic narrative conventions of the backstage musical: romantic coupling and the production of a show. Following directly on the heels of these narrative events is "Choreography," a shrill warning against the menace posed to these same conventions by modernism.
</p>

<p>
The number, which poses as a full dress rehearsal, begins with Phil (Kaye) in tight black pants and turtleneck, a black beret on his head, accompanied by six female dancers in plain grey smocks, each with long hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. Together they move across the stage jerkily, their bodies adopting angular poses, expressions of dramatic intensity on their faces. The music is dissonant, arrhythmic: squealing horns, shrieking strings, ominous kettledrums. The stage is framed in back by a kind of spare grid of red latticing, with occasional in-fills of blue wall; attached to the latter are what appear to be fragments of ancient sculptural friezes, a small, asymmetrical pyramid of steps sits in back, adjoining the grid. The entire tableau is obviously meant to read: "modernism." The dancing a parody of Martha Graham, the set low-grade Mondrian.
</p>

<p>
After the Graham-like intro, the music shifts into a bouncy, swingtime sound, and Phil, now moving like a seasoned vaudevillian, begins to sing:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Chaps who did taps <br />
Aren't tapping anymore <br />
They're doing choreography. <br />
Chicks who did kicks <br />
Aren't kicking anymore  <br />
They're doing choreography. <br />
Heps who did steps <br />
That would stop the show in days that used to be, <br />
Through the air they keep flying <br />
Like a duck that is dying. <br />
Instead of dance it's choreography.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
This song ends with Phil and his dancers huddled together near the floor in another Graham-esque pose. They look up to see, descending from the ceiling, a pair of thin legs in pink stockings. Once the feet hit the floor, one foot and then the other taps at an impossible speed while Phil and company look on in amazement. The camera pulls back to reveal that these legs belong to Judy who proceeds to tap-dance Phil and his modern dancers into submission. In this heroic battle of aesthetics, she is aided by Johnny who bounds onto the screen from the offscreen space beneath the stage, precisely complementing Judy's descent from above. As Phil and his dancers are coerced into cooperation with Judy and Johnny, modernism, at least for the moment, appears to have been vanquished so that traditional entertainment can reclaim its endangered, apparently tenuous, hegemony (. <a href="#2a">2a</a> and <a href="#2b">2b</a>).
</p>

<p>
This satire of modernist dance&#x02014;which, by the way, is as absurd as it is entertaining&#x02014;was actually anticipated by a similar attack on Martha Graham performed by the Denishawn dance company almost twenty years earlier, in 1937 in New York. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, who founded Denishawn in 1915, were pioneers of modern 

<b></b>

dance in the United States. Shawn's choreography embraced athleticism and sought to distance dance, especially in pieces choreographed for his male dancers, from its association with effeminacy. He was interested in reviving and reworking elements of American folk traditions in his choreography, which gave his work a hybrid feeling of experimentation and conservatism. Martha Graham was actually a student at Denishawn, but as she moved to articulate her own modernist choreography that broke much more radically with traditional movement, she also moved outside the orbit of Shawn's affections. The rupture between Shawn and Graham explains the fact that in the middle of Shawn's dance epic <i>O libertad!</i>, he himself appeared in a piece entitled "Depression" in which he performed a parody of a Graham-like character described as: "a hag in robes, ringlets and a frightening mask."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
"Choreography" is actually part of a tradition in Hollywood filmmaking of taking pot shots at modern art and the culture of modernism. A similar swipe at modernism via dance occurs in <i>Funny Face</i> (Stanley Donen, USA, 1957) when the Audrey Hepburn character, Jo Stockton, performs a modernist dance number in a left bank caf&#x000E9;. In an article entitled "The Childish, the Insane and the Ugly: The Representation of Modern Art in Popular Films and Fiction of the Forties," Diane Waldman surveys a number of genre films to explore how Hollywood's "attacks on modern art pander to the lowest common denominator, anti-intellectualism, xenophobia and redbaiting" but also "point to the very real class nature of artistic taste, the gap between high and mass culture."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Similarly, in an influential essay on the musical, "Entertainment and Utopia," Richard Dyer points to the numbers from both <i>Funny Face</i> and <i>White Christmas</i> as examples of the way in which the films insist on the "contradiction between art and entertainment."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While both articles are immensely useful, and while I agree with Waldman's observation about the class alignment, in Hollywood filmmaking, of "high" and "low" (or in her terms "mass") culture, I want to explore "Choreography" a bit more closely in order to muddy these too-clear distinctions between high and low, elite and mass, art and entertainment, modernism and Hollywood.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the movements of the "modern" dancers and the tap dancers in "Choreography" could not be clearer. However, when we look at the scene as a whole and discount, for a moment, its obvious anti-modernism, the picture becomes rather more complicated. Judy's descent from above and Johnny's leap from below are clearly choreographed so as to demonstrate the increased height of the VistaVision image. Meanwhile the scenographic lattice-grid, itself an example of modernist design-sensibility, functions as a very literal graph of the dimensions of the image. Both the grid and the Graham-esque movement are clearly indicated as belonging to a modernism against which the tap dancers must struggle. However, the function of the descending and ascending bodies is exactly that of the modernist grid: to demonstrate the spatial and visual properties of VistaVision. From a purely formal-technological point of view, there is no contradiction between the scene's modernist elements and its elements of traditional entertainment. Both perform the work of demonstrating the sensuous properties of the image <i>as</i> image; both, it might be argued, perform the work of modernism, what Clement Greenberg has characterized as a "pure preoccupation with the invention and arrangement of spaces, surfaces, shapes, colors . . . ."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Of course, there is nothing at all "pure" about <i>White Christmas</i>. But neither, as recent art history has demonstrated, is there anything pure about modernism.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  While the cross-contamination of mass culture and high or elite cultures associated with modernism has been well researched in other disciplines, less attention has been paid to this question in film history. When Hollywood and modernism have been studied together, what is most often demonstrated is Hollywood's practice of "importing" an avant-garde, the most famous example being the emigration of German filmmakers to Hollywood during the years of fascism. Meanwhile, in the literature on the cinematic American avant-garde of the 1950s, 1960s, and beyond, consistent attention has been paid to the way in which avant-gardists have appropriated elements of mass culture 

<b></b>

and Hollywood filmmaking in their own radical practices (e.g., Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, etc.).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Both of these tendencies conceive of the relationship between Hollywood and modernism as one characterized by a two-way street of appropriation. Instead, I would like to try to conceptualize a way of seeing both occupying the same territory, together at once.
</p>

<p>
Compare, for instance, the experimentation on the properties of the image in "Choreography," that moment when Vera-Ellen's leg enters the film frame from above, with the first shot of Maya Deren's <i>Meshes of the Afternoon</i> (USA, 1944), perhaps the most famous of American avant-garde films, in which a mannequin's arm extends, uncannily, into the frame from the top of the image to place a paper flower on the pavement (. <a href="#3a">3a</a> and <a href="#3b">3b</a>). What separates these two cinematic moments?
</p>

<p>
Deren's intention was to explore in detail, almost scientifically, the properties of cinematic representation, the cinema's ability to expand and challenge our sense of space and time.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Of course, in terms of these films' cultural circulation, the way they were funded and produced, the worlds they inhabited and were directed towards, <i>everything</i> separates them. And yet, I think we miss out on a richer appreciation of both film history and the wider cultural history of which film history is but one part, if we insist on isolating these two examples of cinematic experimentation from one another, arranging them side by side in separate but equal compartments.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The mutual implication of aesthetic modernism and genre filmmaking of which <i>White Christmas</i> is an example becomes even more intriguing when we continue to consider the face-off between modernist dance and tap as a competition between two forms of specialized labor. On the one hand, modern dance is itself fundamentally about labor&#x02014;about presenting itself as a form of labor, of bodily exertion that is not effaced as exertion. Modernist dance, as Deborah Jowitt explains, intends on making visible and sensuously apparent an understanding of its art as work and struggle in its ". . . engaging parts of the body in adversary relationships to each other . . . [and its] accentuating the power of gravity . . . "<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Tap, in many ways, with its machinic sounds and Fordist rhythms, is also about labor, but in a different way&#x02014;it wants to reinforce a myth of this labor's carefree spontaneity.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Whereas the dance that the Graham-esque dancers in "Choreography" perform is made to look foolishly labored, Vera-Ellen's performance is sheer virtuosity that seems to generate itself effortlessly while also reminding us of the unusual talent required to dance in just this way. Meanwhile, Danny Kaye's clownish attempts at modernist dancing suggest that just about anyone could do it, a too-familiar layperson's complaint against modernist aesthetic practices. Consonantly, this entire performance, with its putatively opposed modernist and traditional film musical elements, is entirely in the service of demonstrating the value of this cinematic image, courtesy of Paramount and VistaVision&#x02014;an image whose own value (we are meant to recognize, at least implicitly) derives from the labor gone into producing it, a recognition also encouraged by the studio's publicity.
</p>

<p>
The song sung by Danny Kaye in "Choreography" that I quoted above reads interestingly like a complaint made by the worker whose services are no longer required by the reorganization, at a macro level, of labor and capital. In a sense this song is dead

<b></b>

right, though he is not the victim of modernism, or even of modernist "choreography," but rather of forces in the world of which cinematic modernism is but an index. The shift in labor practices concomitant with the devolution of the studio system is one major cause to which historians attribute the decline of the musical; studios could no longer afford to keep on their steady payroll the artists and technicians necessary to make musicals. Thus, the musical, as the shrillness of this protest clearly, though unintentionally, signifies, was on its way out, despite Vera-Ellen's magnificent success. Seeing "Choreography" as an index of the re-organization in the economic sphere would, of course, fit very neatly with Jameson's periodization of a shift in aesthetics in the 1950s and 1960s that is coincident with the reorganization of capital and labor at a global level.

<p>
The (often bizarre) investment in and investigation of the cinematic image as form and as technology that we see in <i>White Christmas</i> sits, I want to argue here, towards one end of a continuum of cultural and aesthetic practices. On the other end of this continuum sits modernist and avant-garde filmmaking with its own exploration of the dimensions and possibilities of the image. The film, in other words, shares with modernism what Greenberg has called its "dissolution of the pictorial into sheer texture, into apparently sheer sensation, into an accumulation of repetitions."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Greenberg would undoubtedly object to my using his words to discuss here the effects of <i>White Christmas</i>. The film is, after all, undeniably (if not irredeemably) kitsch. In this article I have not intended to suggest that there are no distinctions to be made between the properties of serious high modernism and the properties of the Hollywood musical, however reflexive the latter may be. Rather, I propose a modification to the truism that high culture and low culture either exist purely in opposition, or that they dialectically feed off and into one another, since the language used to describe our experience of the modernist art work can also be used to describe a work like <i>White Christmas</i>. Scholarship that identifies elite culture's debt to mass culture, and/or their seepage into one another, leaves us nonetheless secure in our belief that the two are still, after all, distinguishable. In scholarship and criticism of this sort, Greenberg's binaries remain, I believe, very much in place. Perhaps we are increasingly accustomed to an avant-garde that looks kitschy, or kitsch that seems avant-garde, although we seldom mistake one for the other. The questions I want to pose in and through <i>White Christmas</i> are these: Wouldn't it be more exciting and gratifying, perhaps even useful, if serious modernist art were as immediately apprehensible and could reach as many people as the Hollywood musical did in its day? And wouldn't it be invigorating and salubrious, even, if mass art strove towards the self-conscious rigor of high modernism? Might modernism become more popular and mass art more thoughtful? I think this is something that Eisenstein was trying to discover in his cinema of attractions and Brecht in his epic theater. Some degraded, kitschy version of this desire survives and is recoverable in <i>White Christmas</i>. Thinking and seeing modernism in and through <i>White Christmas</i> might be a way out of the bind that maintains our belief that the avant-garde and kitsch need be so ineluctably locked in their places; might be a way of understanding, that is, Frank O'Hara's seriousness when, upon emerging from a screening of <i>A Star is Born</i> in 1954, he remarked about Judy Garland's peformance: "Well, I guess she's <i>better</i> than Picasso."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
