<p>
Just what is it that makes Rosenquist's paintings from the 1960s look so
contemporary, so appealing? The artist himself claimed a look of nostalgia
for the objects he depicted, such as fifties Fords and Franco-American
spaghetti, whose industrial orange aura served as his Proustian madeleine:
"I felt it as a remembrance of things."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
It is only with the passage of time, in the aftermath of the 1980s
commodity and media deconstructivists (Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger),
and some-time pornographers (Jeff Koons and David Salle), that we can
see the prescience

<b></b>

of his take on mass culture in the late modern period. Like his
contemporary Gerhard Richter, Rosenquist appropriates readymade
photographs and brushes them back into paint, exposing the limits of
the camera by literally blurring the truth of what it sees. From the
surface of Richter's low- definition grisailles hovers the anemic memory
of post-World War II Germany. By contrast, Rosenquist's rainbow-sherbet
vision is firmly cast on the 1950s American landscape emptied out by
the overabundance of things. It trades in the currency of appearances
manufactured by the camera&#8212;the "bordello without walls"&#8212;in
the promiscuity of advertising and the selling of self image.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist's pictorial essays on media sex, lies, and history parallel
the prophetic writings of Marshall McLuhan, whose influence has similarly
been neglected by the art history academy and recent artists alike. Since
the 1980s, media critics have appropriated Frankfurt School theories
of the dehumanizing "culture industry" or the dystopic "simulacrum"
of French post-structuralists.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
McLuhan, like Rosenquist, avoids the value judgments of European
literati, with their understandably elitist reactions of despair and
cynicism. Instead, these two North American pragmatists explore the
fascination and inevitability of the mass media with critical awareness.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
They share the same technique of paradoxical juxtaposition (aphorisms
and collage) punctuated by erudite references (James Joyce and
Marcel Duchamp) as survival strategies against the numbing forces of
technology. Both gleefully subvert the vulgarity and the clich&eacute;
mentality promoted by advertising copy. Non-sequential splicing
of text and canvas ruptures otherwise seamless perception; passive
thinking erupts with racing thoughts and phrases uttered tongue in
cheek. <i>"</i>Look Alive" one of Rosenquist's titles prescribes.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
One of his pervasive verbal visual puns, (based on advertising
slogans and military jargon), it alludes to the function of his
paintings. <i>Look alive</i>: hurry up, look lively, revivify your
vision, dulled by the relentless onslaught of images. See through
appearances and make the metaphorical leaps if you want to get with
the picture.
<p>
In the numerous references to art history that pop up in Rosenquist's
oeuvre, none is more revealing than <i>Sightseeing</i> of 1962. An
homage to Marcel Duchamp, in both the spirit and the letter, it depicts
a cropped view of the word fully registered by the title. The letters
on top, partially readable as "SIGHT" are filled in with the artist's
self-referential rose motif (Rose for Rosenquist). Underneath, the letters
"EE<i>"</i> (following "S") are framed in wood as a picture within a
picture. They block full visual access to cracked glass underneath&#8212;a
clear reference to Duchamp's iconic <i>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her
Bachelors, Even (1915-23) ,</i> also known as <i>The Large Glass .</i>
Sightseeing is a modern phenomenon of speed and mass tourism&#8212;a
view through the small glass of the camera&#8212;which paradoxically
blinds one's real understanding of another culture. But Rosenquist, like
Duchamp, is also a master punster, playing off literal and rative
meanings. Sightseeing: to see sight, to focus on vision, to see twice,
a double take, to have insight.
<p>
Zooming in on seeing, Rosenquist aligns himself with the on-going game
of perception, not the end game legacy of Duchamp's readymade (a legacy
inherited by Andy Warhol). Rosenquist continues to expose the voyeurism
and the violence of the gaze,

<b></b>

but now as it is specifically perpetrated by mechanical and electronic
means. The predatory and phallic fantasy of professionals taking pictures,
writes Susan Sontag, "is named without subtlety whenever we talk about
'loading' and 'aiming' a camera, about 'shooting' a film."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In one of his most unnerving constructions, <i>Bedspring</i> Rosenquist
ties the fragment of a women's face (painted on canvas and based on
photographic reproduction) to the edges of a bed frame, implying a
sadistic binding and stretching of the female body. The "coils" and
"frame" are twine and wood, painted to resemble metal. Bed is what
springs to mind when a man sees a "looker" (slang for a good-looking
woman). Yet as viewers of the work we are disoriented by the off-center
composition of the facial fragment and left with the disturbing
contemplation of a disembodied eye that springs back at us with the force
of our own gaze. That a painting stretcher (see the frame's corner keys)
doubles as the structure of a bed frame, implicates the scopophilia of
high art, as well as the camera, in the modern western tradition.
<p>
The Rose of Rosenquist is also a hybrid of Rrose Selavy ("Eros&#8212;that
<i>is</i> life"), Duchamp's female alter ego. And while sometimes a rose
is just a rose, Rosenquist's choice of self-representation confounds any
attempt to bifurcate his vision in sexist opposition. In the history of
art, Rosenquist's velvety flowers fall between the veiled symbolism of
Georgia O'Keeffe and the open celebrations of Judy Chicago. Who can look
at his lushly painted layers of deep red petals without carnal knowledge,
without recognizing the archetype of female sexuality (both innocence and
experience)? In <i>Sightseeing</i>, note the dark center of the rose,
pictured smack in the middle of the center of the letter "H" as in
"Hole". It is the only rose viewed straight on. Here we have another
form of sightseeing, that of the peep-hole, a particularly male view of
the female sex. Recalling Duchamp's metaphor of the hinge, Rosenquist's
paintings open onto, rather than close off, interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Rosenquist differs from Duchamp, however, in fundamental respects:
he returns painting to the eye and the craft, reinvesting the medium
of oil on canvas with sensuous force. And unlike the overtly cerebral,
secretive Duchamp, Rosenquist is a populist and a showman, the guileless
artist in the paper suit.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist remains understudied by comparison to the attention lavished on
Warhol and Lichtenstein (not to mention the proto-Poppers, Jasper Johns
and Robert Rauschenberg). The reasons are many. The major contributions
of queer and gender studies have played to the advantage of Warhol, and
secondarily to Lichtenstein, whose soft-spoken, reserved demeanor and
"artsy" subject matter gave off a tentative masculinity.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Rosenquist and his work, by contrast, exude a traditional male
heterosexuality energy. In scale and subject, he is "painting with two
balls," in an age where feminist approaches have indicted demeaning
representations of women as they have been constructed by the masculine
gaze.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Understandably, Rosenquist is sensitive to being misinterpreted over
the subject of sex in his images.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
But there it is, looming large. Mistakenly viewed as misogynist, his work
is actually a systematic exposure of gender stereotypes&#8212;feminine
<i>and</i> masculine&#8212;in advertising during the baby-boom era. In
Rosenquist's images of the 1960s, the Mechanical Bride is stripped bare,
as are the Bachelors of Madison Avenue, even.

<b></b>

<p>
Rosenquist also proves to be the exceptional re in a movement
usually characterized as cynical or politically non-committed. Warhol
and Lichtenstein appropriated readymade visuals and drew out their
banality through serial repetition and standardized techniques. Their
subtle alterations and ironic interjections served to distance, rather
than clarify, their personal stance, resulting in an ambiguous position
between complicity and critique.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Be it emotionless ennui, or camp melodrama, Pop, it is said repeatedly,
is all about surface. Yet Rosenquist's work has apparent depth,
especially in the fluid passages of monochrome that lull the eye into a
pleasurable stupor only to be jolted by equally illusionistic renderings
of shiny chrome and mouth-watering citrus. His anti-linear narratives,
based on shifting viewpoints and scale, interspersed with fragments of
seemingly unrelated but oft-repeated images, are oblique but not opaque.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Societal violence, the loss of identity, the ennui of suburbia,
are all messages not so subliminally imparted through the stylized
image relays of his painted medium. Rosenquist's interviews and
parlance&#8212;an aggregate of disjointed stories, a mix of earnestness
and dissembling, and passages of incoherence shot through with framed
exactitude&#8212;match the effects of his paintings. If Warhol and
Lichtenstein represent the cool attitude of Pop, Rosenquist is its
hot-blooded exemplar.
<p>
Rosenquist's work of the early 1960s carries profound messages about
America in the Cold War period, of the predicament of democracy when image
dominates over substance, the visual over the literate. Much has been made
of Rosenquist's training as a billboard artist, which was instrumental
in his insider knowledge of motivational research in the advertising
industry. But the scale and compositional devices of his work also point
to the influence of Mexican mural painting, with its compelling imagery
of churning machines and capitalist greed, and its pointed commentary on
American imperialism in Latin America. He is a history painter in an age
when rative art is discredited, when didacticism, not obscenity,
is taboo, and when the lie of the camera has rendered suspect all
higher moral ground. No cynic, Rosenquist has asserted his position on
gun control and his distrust of the military industrial complex. His
active protest against the Vietnam war is a matter of record, as is
his recent protest against military intervention in Iraq. His images
capture the history of his times, while acknowledging the changes in
historical consciousness wrought by incessant media coverage and the
leveling of difference between the trivial and the catastrophic. In his
own words, his seemingly garrulous images actually impugn "the power of
the commercial advertising which is in turn related to our free society,
the visual inflation which accompanies the money that produces box tops
and space cadets."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Born in 1933, to Depression era parents ("My parents never had any money"
he recalls) Rosenquist reached maturity in the years of unprecedented
American expansion and material wealth.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
He and his peers saw the collapse of New Deal Liberalism and the demise
of the Old Left during the McCarthy era of the 1950s. Rosenquist's
politics were formed in that moment between the dissident Beats and the
radical SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), between the Fifties
and the Sixties&#8212;the moment of the Left's "missing generation"
(<i>TS</i>, 22-30). The deliberate obsolescence and emptiness of the
objects he portrays evoke the sense of a time gone by, whose values

<b></b>

were irrevocably empty in any event. From a pivotal historical
perspective&#8212;the 1950s seen through the libertine revolt and
political disenchantment of the 1960s&#8212;Rosenquist dismantles
the American Dream with the finesse of one who has painted its
fa&ccedil;ade. Pervaded by anonymity and nostalgia, his imagery
triggers our awareness of the allegorical nature of his enterprise,
of meaning constructed out of the seemingly unrelated detritus of our
commercialized culture. Allegorical impulses, like the shadows lurking in
his diaphanous grays, acknowledge that death&#8212;physical, spiritual,
emotional&#8212;dwells just below the surface.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
The acuity of Rosenquist's media commentary can only be understood by
cross reference to his prime source material and ironic foil: the pages
of <i>Life</i> magazine. As the source collages attest, his works of
the early 1960s derive from photographic advertising images and copy,
fragments of which are then scaled-up and given substance of a different
sort through the materiality of paint. Rosenquist's selections were
archival, since the <i>Life</i> issues dated from 1945 to 1955: "I
just found some old <i>Life</i>magazines and I was, you see, searching
for the look of something. . . . I chose images common enough to pass
without notice . . . things that were a little out of style." It was the
"Populuxe" age when material progress found expression in streamlined,
automated appliances and in the look of speed epitomized by the
jet-inspired Chevrolet tailfin.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Aside from its richness as cultural anthropology, <i>Life</i>&#8212;with
its multi-layered presentation of world news, Hollywood celebrity, human
interest, and the weekly miracles of new items to buy&#8212;provided
Rosenquist with a de facto collage structure. In and of themselves,
the ingenious advertisements were a model of improbable juxtapositions,
used to surprise visually and beguile psychologically. Though his work
is often called surrealist, Rosenquist is but a realist documenting
the everyday surreality of American life, where in-depth coverage of
radiation is followed by ads for lanolin-enriched skin cream, manicured
suburban lawns reap the benefits of jet-bomber engineering contracts,
and one watches high-tech annihilation from the comfort of an easy chair.
<p>
In <i>Life</i>,violence, technology, and sex are systematically
exploited for the mass audience with managerial precision. The magazine's
sensationalism was the specific object of McLuhan's earliest critiques of
the media and the advertising industry. A decade before Betty Friedan, he
debunked the industrial workings of the feminine mystique, the pervasive
and perverse visual intercourse between woman and machine depicted in
the popular press.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Packaged with heterosexual erotic overtones, deluxe automobiles and
streamlined appliances become the objects of the new consumer economy of
desire. In Rosenquist's ribald send-up of the sex and machine cultural
mentality, appropriately titled <i>Car Touch</i>, two motorized
panels in the shapes of front end and back end bop each other as their
fenders meet. Throughout his work Rosenquist presents <i>Life</i>'s
hoodwinked phantasmagoria of housewives posing next to juice-excreting
tomatoes that "ripen from the inside out," as the caption promises.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Despite her generating heat, the 1950s siren in the kitchen is merely
an updated model of the erotic Frigidaire; she dehumanizes women and
threatens men with an impossible standard of performance. As McLuhan
was one of the first to observe, women's sexual attributes are not
associated with her "unique self" but are "merely display objects like

<b></b>

the grill work on a car. . . . They are date-baited power levers for
the management of the male audience."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Legs on a pedestal&#8212;an advertisement for seamed stockings that
introduces McLuhan's essay "The Mechanical Bride"&#8212;display
<i>Life</i>magazine's propensity to disassemble the female anatomy,
a telling analogy to the mechanisms of their own corporate "big team
clicking."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In Rosenquist's canvases of the early 1960s, female body parts are
ubiquitous. In particular, one sees the fragmentary repetition of
three standard advertising tropes: smiling face, manicured hands,
and legs in stockings, crossed or straight (the trademark of McLuhan's
"Mechanical Bride"). Though the artist claims his "no-images" derive
from an iconographic "nether-land" without any of the associations that
"a crucifix would have," they nonetheless carry symbolic weight. The
expansive female smile (<i>Hey! Let's Go for a Ride, Look Alive,
Silver Skies</i>) is a "ritualistic mollifier," positioning woman as an
audience pleaser, both subordinate to, and approving of, the hypothetical
viewer. Hands&#8212;seen in <i>Flower Garden, President Elect</i>, and
<i>Vestigal Appendage</i>&#8212;are "a sort of offering. . . . they have
to do with advertising," according to the artist. What exactly is being
offered comes to the fore in Erving Goffman's analysis of the erotics of
nimble fingers: "women, more than men, are pictured using their fingers
and hands to trace the outlines of an object or to cradle it or to
caress its surface. . . . or to effect a 'just barely touching' of the
kind that might be significant between two electrically charged bodies."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Proffering irons or a cigarette, Rosenquist's hands embody the dominant
and domineering gender typecasting of the Cold War era: the devoted
housewife and the Hollywood babe (representations of the army butch or
office worker being much rarer).
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
McLuhan's indictment of <i>Life '</i>s pictorial reportage rests on the
sadistic effects of commingling body parts and spare parts, a criticism
made manifest in Rosenquist's paintings by the frequent appearance of
slinky legs chopped off at thigh or knees (<i>Above the Square, Sitting
Around Screaming, Brighter than the Sun</i>). The sense of danger
and erotic charge is further achieved by the razor sharp montage and
the sultry grisaille that mimic the shadowy style and doomed love of
film noir. Rosenquist's slicing and splicing translate the provocative
literary cut-ups of the Beat writer and prose assailant William Burroughs
(whose readings in the Bowery Rosenquist attended).
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The related paintings <i>Woman I</i> <i>, Marilyn Monroe</i>
 and <i>Woman II</i>  emphasize "click of a shutter" visual
violence in the fragmentary structure of their photo-based collage. The
flashbulb velocity of the composite image also serves as metaphor for
the blinding assault of the media, for the Mechanical Bride, argues
McLuhan, is a powerful reincarnation of Medusa, against which the
collective has no defense, "no mirror of conscious reflection."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
The cosmetically enhanced smiles of <i>Woman I</i> and <i>Marilyn
Monroe</i>are more threatening than usual and allude to the toothy leers
of De Kooning's famous <i>Woman</i>series (1950-55), which was itself
stimulated by the postwar pin-up.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
But Rosenquist establishes his distance from De Kooning's gestural
excitement (and that of the Abstract Expressionist generation) by
cueing us to the impersonal "all come hither but no deliver" essence
of mechanical reproduction that he simulates in paint. The message of

<b></b>

his Marilyn Monroe also differs from Warhol's obsessive depiction of this
movie star and apotheoses of the famous, whether Jacqueline Kennedy or
Elizabeth Taylor. Warhol singles out the media power of these individuals,
even as their actual personalities are effaced by the ad nauseam copying
and smudges of the silkscreen process. By contrast, Rosenquist's painted
collage of disconnected facial features shows the platinum blonde with
red lips to be on a level with the anonymous <i>Woman I</i>and <i>Woman
II</i>&#8212;merely one more product of McLuhan's "Love-Goddess Assembly
Line," a manufactured <i>and</i> replaceable array of titbits and sound
bites. Painted letters of her name share the billing with the fragmented
logo of Coca-Cola. The audience is left unsated and hungry for more of
the same. "Hollywood has always been a supermarket of personality," writes
Lincoln Kirstein in his elegy to Monroe. "As in modern supermarkets, the
comestibles come packed with additives, preservatives and detergents;
and while not immediately lethal, such nourishment has not the savor
that nature intended."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
With sex as an instrument of power and increasingly mechanical act,
comes the automated drive to danger and destruction. <i>I Love with
You with My Ford</i> embraces technology, love, and death in its own
tripartite composition. The aggressive shifts in scale and focus and
the brutal transition from black and white to garish color adumbrate the
sense of doom. The source collage for the top register, taken from an ad
with the enticement, "Test drive a '50 Ford,"&#8212;shows the standard
female model leaning seductively on the car hood (McLuhan's pairing of
grill and girl). Though repressed in the final painting, this detail
metaphorically returns when the vertical sequence jumps fast into the
act of back seat consummation. Rosenquist makes visual the mythic "loss
of self" in the sexual act by obscuring the individuality of the couple
embracing in a movie close-up style.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
(In the 1950s, Rosenquist frequently painted the faces of Hollywood
stars on billboards.) Most noticeably, we lose our perceptual
bearings in trying to discern the features of the male, whose hair,
ear and undulating folds of flesh assume, as Rosenquist described it,
the incongruous enormity of a whale ("IWJR," 31). The shock of the
brilliant-orange spaghetti at the base of the picture reverberates as an
allusion to the spilled guts or brains of an automobile disaster. "I
thought being explicit about violence wasn't very cool or smart,"
Rosenquist reveals, "If you could suggest terror by metaphor, it was
stronger than showing terror."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
But trauma is soon assuaged when we realize that the content is all
manufactured anyway: the engine is mass-produced, the love is celluloid,
and the food is canned. Like all extensions of man, these technologies
increase work efficiency, while inuring us to over-stimulation
and simulated experience. As Rosenquist has repeatedly expressed,
"It's like being hit on the head with a ballpeen hammer. You become
numb. You're constantly hit upon. . . . So I thought something could
be done in that numbness, that power" ("IWJR," 32; "JR," 29).
<p>
Even when women were outside the home, they were associated with the
machinery at their fingertips. The 1950s saw the rise of the female office
worker, who, like the devoted housewife, provided able-bodied assistance
to the man in charge. The "pushbutton" efficiency of the secretary was
defined by her typing speed and her availability for services after hours.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
In the diptych <i>Pushbutton</i> (1960-61) an oversized fragment of a
woman's lower legs surmounts the predella of a shiny apparatus. The

<b></b>

buttons, however, do not belong to a typewriter, as the contingency of the
fingers pointed down at first suggest. Instead, the artist chose a 1947
advertisement for the then newfangled Philco car radio, whose distinctive
six square button design replaced the cumbersome tuning-dial. Now, with
the flick of a finger, one hand could instantly find the right music,
while the other was occupied with more pressing matters. Indeed, the
gendering of the hand on the right (no nails) confirms that in the office
or in the car, men are at the controls. Rosenquist's handwritten notes on
the source collage for the painting confirms the string of associations:
"driving" "push my button" "what turns me on" "rush."
<p>
Not to be confused with the automatic writing of the Surrealists
(or his personal fantasies) Rosenquist's self-conscious word play
acknowledges how common speech and technological terms are inundated with
a new heterosexualized vernacular. With <i>Hey Let's go for a Ride</i>
,the title is a sexual solicitation, and a women's inviting smile
is literally in the viewer's face. Once the provenance of subcultures,
slang is now universally transmitted through advertising and by the
instant commercialization of culturally transgressive forms.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The source collage for <i>In the Red</i> contains a selling point,
"you serve it," clipped directly from the ad copy for hearty soup. It
allows us to extrapolate on the relationship between the man's state
of dress/undress, signaled by the socks, and the woman's nakedness
in the final painting. The title itself is slang for insolvency,
financial trouble, or being "in the soup," which the image literally
depicts. It is a reminder that despite the media blitz, whole segments
of the population could not afford the material attributes of the
good life. Rosenquist's haunting narrative, with its impoverished,
tinny grays, intimates the actual pressures of "to have and have not"
on sexual and marital relationships.
<p>
The punning title of <i>Pad</i>  simultaneously refers to the
take off and landing area for aircraft and to where one beds down. The
sexual and technological are further linked by the concept of speed,
and brought into exciting proximity by the painting's pairing of United
States Air Force insignia and the glistening tailfin of a phallic
Cadillac. Rosenquist's titles draw us into to a deeper contemplation
of his pictorial rebuses. Yet, on another level, they make us aware
of the complicit relationship between the "straightforwardness" of the
photographic image and the "accuracy" of the accompanying caption. The
age of speed abbreviates communication; it forces instant recognition
and elides deep interpretation, at the same time that it impoverishes
spoken discourse into catch phrases and clich&eacute;s.
<p>
Aside from its role as pure advertising come-on, the thrill of the
automobile radically altered the courting rituals and sexual behavior
of young Americans (<i>PACC</i>, 23). Quick trysts in the automobile
replaced long and highly visible romance on the front porch. Hence
<i>Lanai</i>, whose tropical title intensifies the torpid heat of imagery,
but also puns on the car as the new lanai&#8212;the Hawaiian word for
veranda. Rosenquist's masterpiece on the collision of hot rods and hot
sell, <i>Lanai</i> drips with sensuality in paint, with textures creamy,
silky soft, and viscid above all. Female flesh exudes its artificial
glow in the honey liquid of the peaches and the titillating pink of the
female nude about to take the plunge. The painting climaxes with the
upside-down Buick

<b></b>

Skylark soaring over and spilling seed, a fluid veil of pattern created by
the "applikay" patterns of a wallpaper roller. From the Del Monte fruit
("a peach" being a common slang for a woman) to the kneeling re
derived from the White Rock girl, Rosenquist knows we know that the
metaphors are hardly fresh. As with many of his paintings, the look of
airbrush increases the visual dazzle, while simultaneously alerting us
to the manufacturing of sexual allure. "I wanted to use the tools and
technology of advertising. . . . I had been directed to paint things
hot and juicy, to sell them" ("JR," 29.)
<p>
Unlike the impermeable surfaces of Warhol and Lichtenstein, Rosenquist's
seduce with their tactile, hand-painted quality. His strokes incarnate
both the banality of the mechanical blur and the mystery of a transparent
veil. He foregrounds the media construction of heterosexual desire,
not only in the standardized iconography, but also in the visual
stimulation of all five senses. The sexual puns, both visual and verbal,
are slathered on with references to food&#8212;the tastes and textures of
oral gratification&#8212;in the form of melting butter, luscious fruits,
and dripping ice cream. Cheesecake, after all, is the term for the soft
pornographic, pin-up images of women. Slang is an inherently masculine
form of language, an aggressive release of communication that harbors
inside sexual jokes in its meaning and delivery. Food and sex are linked
by subconscious desires, made manifest in the promotion of pleasure by
advertising images and double entendres of satisfaction guaranteed.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Rosenquist's surfaces allude to the deceiving gloss of magazines and
cosmetic overlays. His brushstrokes do not revel in the butter-cream
icing consistency of a Wayne Thiebaud, but are spread out mundane and
thin, making visible their derivation from mechanical reproduction, from
<i>Life</i>magazine, and not from life itself. The individual painting
surface is eroticized in tension with the industrialized impulse of
the copy, revealing the operation of the commodity fetish underneath.
<p>
The originality of Rosenquists's send-ups and cut ups with regards to
media sex is apparent by comparison to his artistic offspring. The
<i>Celebration</i>ejaculation paintings of Jeff Koons, where melted
cheese spews across the canvas, are made all the more formulaic by
the geez whiz content of the artist's public persona. The body parts
of Rosenquist become merely repetitious and prurient views in Salle's
work, where the grisaille takes on the tawdry, onanistic glare of the TV
screen. Some twenty-five years later, plastic sentiment, visual monotony,
and mere ironic reiteration have sunk in. By contrast to Rosenquist's
critical awakening of our perceptual faculties, here nothing is added
to the expression or revelation of advertising's mechanisms, or what
media critic Stuart Ewen has called the power of "all consuming images."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist is a "jammer," who disrupts the one-way dictates and subliminal
persuasions of the media. He demands depth on the part of the viewer,
interrupting the normal state of habitual non-attentiveness.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Yet he operates in the terms of the electronic age&#8212;not by voicing
opinion in a rational, sequential analysis, but through simultaneous
relay of piecemeal, if precisely, coded information, sensory overload,
and hybrid media sources (painting, text, photography, film). His
aphoristic approach bears closer comparison to the feminist artists
of the 1980s, rather than their male contemporaries; for example the
untitled film stills of Cindy Sherman, which lay bare the

<b></b>

cinematic conventions of female sexuality and withdrawal. Rosenquist's use
of oblique and slightly scurrilous titles that prompt the viewer to fill
the gaps and be aware of manipulation predates Jenny Holzer's more sober
truisms, while Barbara Kruger's expos&eacute;s of advertising culture,
are based, like Rosenquist's, on the jarring effects of collage. Bertold
Brecht's alienation effect&#8212;ripping open the seams of the seemingly
natural&#8212;is adapted from live theater to all-encompassing commodity
spectacle.
<p>
As noted earlier, Rosenquist draws upon advertising images from the
1950s, the decade when mass psychoanalysis was systematically plumbed
by the managerial class. According to Ernst Dichter, the chief promoter
of so-called <i>motivational research</i>, the skilled advertiser had to
"sell his merchandize by associating it with ideas of success, security
and social prestige," overriding actual feelings of sexual inadequacy
and self- doubt.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Rosenquist's <i>The Light that Won't Fail I</i>  acknowledges
the illusory haze of confidence temporarily provided by the cigarette,
as the woman exhales with her head jauntily aloft. Striking a shadowy
silhouette in the lower right, the cigarette in hand reiterates the
sophisticated pose of the film noir temptress. The light will not fail in
seducing either, as we infer from the man in the act of dress/undress
(putting on or removing a sock.) "Believe in yourself!" urges the
original caption of the Philip Morris ad, prompting the selective irony
of Rosenquist's title.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Mundane products made glamorous&#8212;cigarettes, socks, and hair
comb&#8212;promise the attainment of personal goals, but when we see them
isolated from their original contexts and dispersed among simulated human
fragments, such faith in things is revealed as mere pathetic fallacy.
<p>
Dichter promoted his marriage of Freud to commodity capitalism in
books such as <i>The Psychology of Everyday Life</i>  and <i>The
Strategy of Desire</i> . With notorious efficiency, corporations
hired marketing agencies to delve into the collective mind, inspiring a
backlash of media critique and conspiracy theories, most notably Vance
Packard's 1957 <i>The Hidden Persuaders</i>.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Dichter's subliminal erotics and the ad-men's glorification of
domesticity were specifically indicted by Betty Friedan as the root
causes of the debilitating feminine mystique: "They are guilty of
persuading housewives to stay at home, mesmerized in front a TV set,
their nonsexual human needs unnamed, unsatisfied, drained by the sexual
sell into the buying of things."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Intimate with the probing and groping techniques of modern advertising,
Rosenquist made clear his debt to the market researchers and the need to
draw their innovations into the painted medium, if only to reflexively
activate our perceptions.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<i>Blue Spark</i>  incorporates an actual bamboo fishing
pole to visualize the industry's dominant metaphor of "lowering the
hooks"&#8212;to catch the consumer with the right bait and reel in the
"homo boobiens."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
One end of the pole touches the surface of flesh-colored body parts,
which are deceptively alluring, their precise identity ungraspable. The
other pulls back a cloth curtain to reveal the source of the illusions
cast before us: a set of manicured nails (a synecdoche for sexual
seduction) dangles the blue line&#8212;both the shadow of the rod and
the spark that sells.
<p>
That Rosenquist's gaze is not misogynist, but a knowing appraisal of
the mass media, emerges when we look at the larger depiction of sexual
difference in his art. True, women are standardized into objects of
seduction, their faces and bodies violently

<b></b>

decontextualized. Yet men fare no better. It is astonishing to observe
the total lack of a male visage in Rosenquist's works of the sixties,
aside from his specific portraits of John F. Kennedy, Bo Diddley and
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley. Instead individual identity disappears,
as we see men only from behind or with headless bodies, or with their
facial features deliberately obliterated. Like <i>The Incredible Shrinking
Man</i>of 1953, Rosenquist's strategy of making men invisible functions
as an allegory of masculinity in crisis. What better pronouncement
on the fate of the modern guy than <i>Waves</i> , where he is
depicted as an anonymous blank, as an outsmarted lout who is programmed
to respond to the active solicitations of female imagery. And like the
female, the male half of consumer society is defined by what he buys and
what he wears. In paintings such as <i>Look Alive</i>, <i>In the Red
,</i> and<i>Silver Skies ,</i> Rosenquist's men also emerge in serial
fragments&#8212;most frequently in the guise of socks or trousers, or
to a lesser extent as a suit jacket or uniform&#8212;therein reduced
to businessman or sportsman, one in a series of infinitely replaceable
types. In <i>The Light that Won't Fail I</i> and<i>A Lot to Like</i>combs
and razors appears as the standard apparatus of male grooming, as mass
produced and repressive instruments of uniform hygiene and the clean-cut
look. An equal-opportunity flaneur, Rosenquist perceives the construction
of stereotypes in advertising across gender lines, sparing neither sex
in the media stream from his roving eye.
<p>
Here again, Rosenquist used advertising from earlier <i>Life</i>magazines
to comment on the sell of masculine self-image. The early 1960s was a
period during which moral attitudes and, in effect, "domestic containment"
policies of the previous decade were already being challenged by the
<i>Playboy</i> fantasy of the bachelor's domain and the Beat revolt
against materialist and rigid heterosexual values. During WWII, media
images of half-dressed soldiers and male intimacy abounded, but in the
initial Cold War years, <i>Life</i> propagated the new climate of sexual
panic and homophobia. Photographs of men touching or in suggestive
physical proximity as well as body-flexing poses and male nudity were
drastically curtailed.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Significantly, in Rosenquist's work, the male body is never depicted
even partially unclothed, or in homosocial circumstances; as sources,
he only chose advertisements for sports and drink, the two forms of male
bonding legitimized by postwar consumer images. His underdepicted men
are painfully alone and isolated, their vulnerability and submission
to authority red by diametrically opposed views: seen from above,
socks at floor level emphasize the awkwardness of undress; seen from
below, pants suggest the submissive upward gaze of a child toward the
father. Socks and pants are common fodder for sexual slang expressing
male virility and orgasm, but in Rosenquist's compositions male
braggadocio, whether visual or verbal, is unrealized by the staid
rendition of ties, cuffs and jackets in boring shades of gray and brown.
<p>
Like his housewife counterpart, the new post-war man was a good
citizen by virtue of role-playing: breadwinner, father, patriot and
consumer. Demagogues and admen implied that any deviation from these
prescribed identities would lead to juvenile delinquency and / or
homosexuality and its "natural" counterpart, communism.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Rosenquist highlights the predicament of white middle-class masculinity,
straight jacketed

<b></b>

by standardized dress and codes of behavior. His paintings of men and
male accoutrements embody sameness and the loss of autonomy through a
repetitive, serial structure. The composition <i>1947, 1948, 1950</i>
, symbolically drained of all color, satirizes the lack of
inventiveness in business attire, in particular the tie, whose sartorial
stricture was the preeminent sign of capitalist patriarchal authority.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist pictures the leveling of personality demanded by the corporate
and military ethos, perhaps unwittingly linking America's institutional
conformism to that of totalitarian governments. His study <i>Up from the
Ranks</i> takes from a 1954 advertisement touting "Presidents of
the Company in the Bell System."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Like the grid composition of a black and white archival photograph
or mug shot, the original ad contained brief biographical copy
identifying the executives, who spent an average of 34 years, we are
told, advancing in upper management. Rosenquist reversed the placement
of the original registers and erased the faces, making them "look like
eggs in a carton." The resulting image brings to mind Stalin's practice
of eliminating individuals in fact and in historical representation:
executed party members were efficiently removed from official photographs
through montage and air brush.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Warhol subsequently used a mug shot as the basis for his mural
<i>Thirteen Most Wanted Men ,</i> created for Philip Johnson's New York
State Pavilion at 1964 World's Fair. The inside joke title refers not
only to the FBI's most wanted list but also the potential objects of
Warhol's homosexual desire.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
By contrast, Rosenquist's washed-out men remain unwanted on every level;
they are "up from the ranks to nowhere," as the artist confirmed.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Although they bear the attributes of power suits, the corporate seal
of approval, and horny-rimmed glasses, one concludes that the blonde
women masquerading in <i>Life</i> indeed had more fun.
<p>
Rosenquist's <i>Shave</i> brilliantly delineates the fragile
boundaries of the male self. The ritual act of shaving normally affirms
virility, but here the face of the man disappears, obliterated by the
encroaching negative space of the yellow shaving cream, as Rosenquist
specifically intended.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The psychological effect is remarkably similar to <i>Portrait in a
Mirror</i> , the photograph by Surrealist Raoul Ubac of a face
reflected in a corroding mirror. In both works, the reflected image
subverts rather than confirms identity, by dissolving facial features
and contours. As Rosalind Krauss observes (drawing on the mirror stage
thesis of Jacques Lacan), the "disarticulation of the self" by means
of its reflected double "immobilizes the subject in a cat's cradle of
representation." One's own sight no longer constitutes the site of the
self. Rosenquist's choice of gender confirms that not only female, but
also male subjectivity, is constructed by the power of appropriating
gazes, directed from without.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>
The crises of male identity and the loss of self attributed to the
corporate mentality were popularized in the 1950s by best-selling
nonfiction such as David Reisman's <i>The Lonely Crowd</i>,
William Whyte's <i>The Organization Man</i>  and by Sloan Wilson's
novel <i>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</i> . Sharing a similar
social critique, these authors bemoaned changing American values and
character. Buying power had replaced individualism and having things
compensated for lack of personal agency. In particular, Reisman
articulated the evolution from "inner-directed man," whose

<b></b>

drive was motivated by underlying personal ethics, to "other-directed man"
who was led by the approval of peers groups and the desire to belong. As
opposed to the individualistic thinker of the nineteenth century, who
knew too much, the man of modern industrialized society "never knew who
he was."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
In <i>Volunteer</i> , Rosenquist documents the predicament of "the
volunteer who is puzzled; doesn't know what to do but is willing," as he
wrote on the collage study for the work. The headless man ratively
finds his place in uniform, branded by his green suit and red armband, and
regimented by the belt illusionistically tightened across the perimeter
of the painting's surface. Of the various permutations of men in uniform,
Rosenquist also focuses on the virile athlete. His <i>4 1949 Guys</i>
questions the social status accorded to pure physical prowess, as well
as the commercial practice of celebrity endorsement. The original 1949
advertisement displayed the photographic portraits of "four top men in
American sports" (Lou Boudreau, Ben Hogan, Joe Di Maggio and Jack Kramer),
each promoting the Chesterfield brand: "the one I'm really glad to put
my name on. It's <i>my</i>cigarette."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
In the final painting a looming gun barrel, an ice-cream cone and body
parts efface the original personalities. He upends the traditional role
of attributes in portraiture, since the thing no longer becomes the man,
but the man becomes the thing itself.
<p>
The rugged athletes, army men, and resolute corporate executives assessed
by Rosenquist likewise provided McLuhan with his masculine counterparts to
the mechanical brides. The strong man demeanor and survival of the fittest
mentality were both quaint and hopelessly biological, observed McLuhan,
by comparison to the actual powers behind the media that proffered
these stereotypes: "Real toughness today has shifted from the personal
Darwinian melodrama to the abstractions of logistics, cybernetics
and consumer research. Thanks to the refinements and perversions of
statistical measurement and International Business Machine logistics,
it is now easy for little esthetising gents to be much more powerful
than the Jadwins ever were. Goebbels was much more dangerously corrupt
and destructive than Goering.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist's imagery implicitly acknowledges that corporate
advertising was for decades a male-driven, propaganda machine, but
one of his few images where men and women appear together is highly
instructive. <i>Untitled (Blue Sky</i> as it is appropriately
named, asks the viewer to step into the picture and occupy a role. Two
rectangular panels, oriented in opposite directions, form empty screens
on which we may project our own faces. Below each panel, either trousers
and wingtips or stockings and pumps cue us as to which side we belong,
the masculine or feminine. Yet with a last minute reversal to keep us
on our toes, Rosenquist colors the male half pink and the female, dull
shades of gray, confounding established codes of gender difference. By
rendering the physical gait of the pair otherwise identical, he also
underscores how our expectations are socially constructed. The largely
empty field of the canvas and dumb presence of the rectangles in place
of talking heads, suggests we are all considered blank slates, ready to
be scripted by advertising or editorial blurbs.
<p>
The postwar phenomenon of burgeoning suburbia did much to inculcate
gender stereotypes of doting fathers and devoted housewives. Rosenquist
reserved his most

<b></b>

poignant imagery for the rendition of empty yards and Levittown-like
subdivisions, substituting single photo-based images for his usual
collage cut-ups. <i>Untitled (Two Chairs)</i>, <i>Win a New House This
Christmas (Contest) ,</i> and <i>Front Lawn</i> capture dreary sameness in
subject and style. Visual monotony arises from the methodical absence of
facture and the arresting of the photographic blur in painted form. The
garish glow of soon-to-be-outmoded decor and ad copy promoting dreams
come true betray the mood of quiet desperation. In <i>Growth Plan</i>
the artist paints a collective portrait of the Wonder Bread years,
lining up his subjects with a militaristic discipline redolent of
Alesandr Rodchenko's 1930s photographs of Soviet youth. Rosenquist's
own appropriation of a photographic image accentuates the anonymity
and replicated aura of mass-produced people. <i>Rainbow ,</i> an
uncharacteristically melodramatic image, envisions the release of
pent-up frustrations endemic to 1950s conformity. Broken glass and a
threatening fork puncture the serenity of the nuclear family pictured
in <i>Life</i>and on the TV screen. "Stabbing the meat; blood in the
rainbow," the artist's description on the source collage attests.
<p>
Rosenquist's <i>Nomad</i>, an epic on the itinerant culture of commodity
capitalism, depicts life lived from one "NEW" purchase to another. Fast
food and picnic tables cater to the temporary quality of modern
existence, and home sweet home can be recreated wherever the billfold
opens. <i>Nomad</i> displays an oversized General Electric bulb, a
leitmotif that appears throughout Rosenquist's work. For McLuhan, electric
light represented the most primitive medium of mass communication, one
that nonetheless radically eliminates time and space in human relations to
form the conduit of our "global village." The tribal condition of modern
man, he writes, arises from the disembodied connections of high-speed
technology, which "mingles the cultures of prehistory with the dregs
of industrial marketers, the non-literate with the semiliterate and the
postliterate" (<i>UM</i>, 16). Not coincidently, the tomato sauce in the
lower right of <i>Nomad</i>derives from an ad where the copy reads "Hunt
for the best" (a pun on the Hunt's brand name) Rosenquist's nomadism also
refers to the condition of fine art in the age of mechanical reproduction
and museum spectacle. "The way art is sent around, all over the place. . . there could almost be a suitcase handle on the top of this picture."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
The nomadic image emerged with prints, proliferated with photography,
and exponentially increased with television, whose medium also occupied
Rosenquist in a series of TV paintings that mimic the kinetic flow
and linear waves of the low-resolution screen. The unrivalled power of
television as a vehicle of persuasion&#8212;"the new frontier"&#8212;was
confirmed by John F. Kennedy's campaign for the Democratic nomination
in 1959-60.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Kennedy became known as the "television President" for his successful
exploitation of the medium, fine-tuning the mass sales pitch begun
in the 1950s when Madison Avenue turned politics into a consumer
business. The Republicans had earlier gained the lead in marketing with
the advertising agency B. B. D &amp; O. Although the Democrats then
hired Norman, Craig &amp; Kummel, the firm that had created the wildly
successful "I Dreamed I Went Walking in my Maidenform Bra" campaign,
Adlai Stevenson lost to the incumbent Eisenhower in the 1956 election.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Stevenson, nonetheless,

<b></b>

had the last word: "The idea that you can merchandise candidates for
high office like breakfast cereal . . . is the ultimate indignity to
the democratic process."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
The Democrats' win in 1960&#8212;a piece of cake, as Rosenquist surmised
in <i>President Elect</i>&#8212;was in no small part due to Kennedy's
talent as poster boy. His image saturated in the media, Kennedy became,
like the junk food and car, another promotional item. "<i>President
Elect</i> is about an empty promise," confirms the artist, "It is
picture of a man advertising himself."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
Rosenquist admits his fascination with the "speed and force" of the mass
media, "the way things are thrust at us, the way this invisible screen
that's a couple of feet in front of our mind and our senses is attacked
by radio and television and visual communications."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The multifold data torrent that has altered habitual sense perceptions
and cognitive processes gave rise to McLuhan's dictum "the medium is
the message"; the way information is conveyed, rather than its content
per se, constitutes the real power of mass communication. After the
linear thinking of the typeset press and mechanical age, we entered the
non-sequential scattershot domain of images. Rosenquist's cinematic
<i>Horseblinders</i> is a parable of vision in daily experience: how
our lives are governed by forces that we cannot, or choose not to,
see. This wraparound composition demands exactly the peripheral vision
that would be blocked by side-shades or horseblinders. Blind is the
operative metaphor here, appearing in the choice of art historical
sources and information communicated sight unseen.
<p>
A thumbnail pressing a button begins the narrative of simultaneous
disconnect, assaulting the viewer with scintillating images switched
on with intermittent frequency. In a red panel at bottom, a single
telephone cord unfolds in multiple profiles, its movement rendered
like a chronophotograph by Etienne Jules Marey. (Invented in the late
nineteenth century, stop-action photography went beyond the capability
of the naked eye, and was adapted by modern artists such as Duchamp to
picture simultaneity itself.) Large panels resembling faux wood grain
with superimposed ovoid forms paraphrase Max Ernst's <i>Blind Swimmer</i>
paintings , which were specifically inspired by Marey's photographic
studies of aerodynamics.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
These panels are connected to an adjacent watery blue field; "Platex Swim
Caps" was writ large on the surface of a pool in the original photo-based
advertisement. Three arcs of light spring forth as pure energy, and
our eyes jump to the colored wire spaghetti of a spliced telephone
cable. Current and flow energize Rosenquist's <i>Horseblinders</i>,
dazzling our eyes with "Day-Glo" color and blurred forms reflected
helter skelter from the painting's shiny aluminum panels. Recognizable
kitchen appliances situate us in a technologically efficient home,
but the question remains as to how plugged into reality we really
are. "It's about being blind to what's going on," states Rosenquist,
underlining the political dimensions of what seems, at first glance,
to be merely a diversion-filled art.
<p>
McLuhan proclaimed that technology alters "sense ratios or patterns
of perception steadily and without any resistance. The serious
artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity,
because he [sic] is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception"
(<i>UM</i>, 18). The role of the late modern seer, combining conceptual
and traditional fine art practices, is to raise the level of visual
literacy. Rosenquist

<b></b>

cites the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage as an influence on his own
pictorial strategies. In his <i>Metaphors on Vision</i> Brakhage writes
of the need for "alive perceptibility," for a particular attention to
the false mirror of mechanical reproduced images. After working in the
motion picture industry Brakhage turned to art films that tested the
viewer's capacity for concentration, boredom and shock. With techniques
analogous to Rosenquist's compositions, Brakhage's films make vision
new by playing with soft and hard resolution, gigantism and minutiae,
and intercut camera angles.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Both artists focus on the fundamental paradox of the photograph: a
mechanical and chemical process that faithfully records nature, so we
believe, even though we know the image can be thoroughly manipulated
and decontextualized. "'To say the camera cannot lie," quipped McLuhan,
"is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practiced in
its name" (<i>UM</i>, 192). By transforming readymade photographs into
paint, Rosenquist detracts from the hot instantaneity of the camera
image and slows it down, demanding a cool or distanced analysis of the
truth it purports to represent.
<p>
In addition to advertisements, <i>Life</i>magazine provided Rosenquist
with fodder to expose the alleged realism of the documentary news
photograph. As founder Henry Luce inadvertently acknowledged in his
mission statement, the new picture magazine had less to do with the
reality of life than how perception shapes our reality: "To see life;
to see strange things; to see things thousands of miles away; to see
and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be instructed."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
The last enjoinder reveals the degree to which <i>Life</i> aimed at
building consensus and national identity through the transparency of the
photographic image. The indiscriminate plethora of visuals in <i>Life</i>
blurred the lines between editorial and advertising, instantaneous
reportage and informed interpretation. Moreover the interspersing of ads
and news features revealed the actual traffic (and frequent conflict of
interest) between the free-enterprise system and the democratic process.
<p>
The photograph had grave consequences for the transformation of
historical consciousness: it arrested the temporal duration previously
ascribed to the linear flow of events into instantaneous, unconnected
moments. As Walter Benjamin surmised, the advent of photography turns the
representation of history into a series of isolated frames, suspending
continuity with the past.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
History becomes mere news of the day. The "front page cubism" of the
popular press eclipses time and distance, levels values, and sustains
moral relativism: celebrities become the new role models, and daily
interest stories of little people compete with the actions of military
coups.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Unbelievable horrors are immediately surpassed and forgotten by the
time the next unprecedented tragedy comes along. As another form of
technology, the media builds in its own obsolescence and with it, the
negation of historical memory. Acutely aware of the demise of sustained
analysis in the age of information overload, Rosenquist comments,
"the minute you take a position on a question or an idea, then the
acceleration of technology, plus other things, will in a short time
have already moved you down the conveyor belt" ("TF111," 590).
<p>
Nonetheless, Rosenquist takes his place as a history painter for his
times, in an era when the likes of Picasso's <i>Guernica</i>, with its
black and white oppositions, can no longer

<b></b>

be rendered. Linear narratives and fixed points of view, like the rigid
eye of the camera, have made all perspectives suspect. Conspiracy theories
abound with the potentially falsified evidence of the mechanically
reproduced image. To make his point, Rosenquist critiques from within
the system, through allusion and gradually imparted information, rather
than making didactic pronouncements from without. The enormous scale of
Rosenquist's works, unlike that of any other Pop artist, clearly places
him in the tradition of mural painting and a politicized, public art. He
has mentioned his debt to the Mexican muralists, though the influence
has never been systematically explored ("TF111," 595). Most noticeably,
his style distinctly recalls that of Siqueiros, who employed photo-based
preparatory techniques, spray-gun, and airbrush, as opposed to the
traditionally executed frescos of Rivera and Orozco. Siqueiros also
used aggressive disparaties of scale and peripheral visual activity to
manipulate the viewer's perceptual faculties.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Gigantic machine parts dominate his proto-Pop iconography of
technology, material excess, and violence. As in his <i>Portrait of the
Bourgeoisie</i> (Electricians Syndicate, Mexico City, 1939-40) Siqueiros
typically placed a menacing conglomerate of gears at center, whose
centrifugal force expands into the viewer's space&#8212;a compositional
device employed by Rosenquist in the projectile lipsticks of <i>House
of Fire II</i> and <i>Swimmer in the Economist</i>.
<p>
By contrast to Siqueiros's murals of class revolution, Rosenquist
paints the post-war world of the atomic bomb. The previous generation
of Abstract Expressionists had also rendered the anxieties of the
nuclear age. Banishing ration, Rothko, Pollock, and Newman depicted
the sublime power of a limitless nature, drawing parallels between
primitive and modern man in the face of unknown or insurmountable
terrors. Dispensing with primordial myths, Rosenquist brings history
painting up to date with specific, if already outmoded images of the
American good life. His works make us confront the superficiality of
consumerism with the profound threat of annihilation. As in the layouts
of <i>Life</i>, where riveting photographs of atomic-test explosions
dovetailed with ads for kitchen gadgets, Rosenquist's imagery encapsulates
the dichotomies of the "pushbutton age." General Electric, Westinghouse,
Chrysler, and Goodyear were all major defense hardware contractors.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
In <i>Pad</i>the pairing of light bulb and airforce insignia visualizes
the political and economic link between household convenience and
automated warfare.The bizarre juxtapositions of tires and heavy
atmosphere, mushroom clouds and hair dryers are not so random after all.
<p>
From deterrent to menace, the specter of nuclear terror undermined the
security wrought by the economic boom of the 1950s and motivated the
generation of the New Left generation.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
Rosenquist acknowledged the direct influence of the Beats, such as
Allen Ginsberg, whose imagery of "sexless hydrogen bombs," pointed to
the underside of the American affluence.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Ginsberg's "Howl"  famously raged against capitalist greed
and its moral destruction of America: "Moloch! Moloch! Robot
apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasures! blind
capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible
madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!"
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
More subtly, Rosenquist unwrapped the governmental packaging of military
might and free enterprise to present the disturbing reality of American
Cold War policy. Take <i>A Lot to</i>

<b></b>

<i>Like</i>&#8212;an ironic retort to the Presidential campaign slogan
"I Like Ike." The rapid-fire sequence of sex and things rendered in
pastel shades and milky-smooth grisaille evokes the material lot enjoyed
during the seemingly benign Eisenhower years. But the visual abundance is
graphically interrupted by the mechanized strokes of hard rain falling
at the bottom rectangle of the canvas. It was painted in 1962, the year
of the Cuban missile crises, during the stand-off between Kennedy and
Khrushchev, when the United States and the Soviet Union almost came to
nuclear blows.
<p>
In the pendant <i>Silver Skies</i><b>,</b> painted that same year,
Rosenquist used a wallpaper roller to leaden the background with "solid
atmosphere" a troubling evocation of radioactive air. The resulting
patterns, like delicate inked script, distinctly evoke the gestures and
vertical columns of Japanese calligraphy. Could Rosenquist's signature
red flower, used here for the first time, possibly refer to the radio
propagandist, Tokyo Rose, or to Ginsberg's radioactive rose? Prompted
by the current crises, <i>Silver Skies</i>and <i>A Lot to Like</i>
looked back to the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, going so far as
to poignantly evoke the imagery of Japanese prints. "Hiroshige rain"
Rosenquist wrote on the bottom of the source collage for <i>A Lot
to Like ,</i> creating an unnerving verbal play between the famous
ukiyo-e artist Ando Hiroshige (1797-1858) and the site of unprecedented
"black rain." In later interviews Rosenquist referred to the umbrella,
not only as protection from fallout, but as an aperture for a view
remarkably like those of famous nineteenth-century, Japanese woodcuts:
"looking out the window and seeing a bright red and yellow atomic bomb
blast, something like a cherry blossom . . . a realistic vision, with
frost or snow on top of it."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
Rosenquist quotes from among the most famous images of a nation's
self-representation, to mourn its unconceivable destruction.
<p>
By contrast, <i>Life</i> magazine graphically documented the atomic
age from the devastating carnage in Japan to the test explosions in the
South Pacific and Nevada; pictorial essays on mushroom clouds erupting
in the desert sky&#8212;the terrifying and awesome spectacle of the
"atomic sublime"&#8212;occurred regularly through the mid-1950s.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Rosenquist's <i>Brighter than the Sun</i> takes its title from
Robert Jungk's book on the atomic scientists. Here the legs of McLuhan's
mechanical bride reappear as a new form of bombshell, like the pinup of
Rita Hayworth purportedly stenciled to a bomb dropped on Bikini Atoll
in 1946.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
The omnipresent sexual reference takes on its full <i>noir</i>
significance in the commingling of eros and thanatos, in the explosive
climax of certain death. "More powerful a soap box economy or a
hydrogen bomb?" writes Rosenquist on the source collage, where the
orange and yellow "O" logo of the Oxydol laundry detergent is eclipsed
by the luminous, ultraviolet glow of a nuclear blast. The marriage of
nylon seamed stockings and modern warfare indicts the common economic
underpinnings of the military industrial complex.
<p>
A catchphrase used by Sixties radicals to protest the inhumane workings
of big government, "the military-industrial complex" was in fact coined
by Eisenhower in his 1961 Farewell Address, as a specific warning for
America's future: "This conjunction of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total
influence&#8212;economic, political, even spiritual&#8212;is felt in every

<b></b>

city. . . . Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Under the subsequent Kennedy administration, however, the "unwarranted
influence of the military industrial complex" only increased, a fact
duly noted by Rosenquist in his <i>F111</i>, where in one source
collage stacks of Kennedy half-dollars lie behind the fuselage of
the new military bomber. Rosenquist's monumental response to the
government's preemptive first-strike policy and its covert and overt
operations abroad, <i>F111</i> protests the spending of tax dollars on
death technology. Rosenquist highlights the irony of a war economy whose
material benefits entice the masses and keeps them content. "The prime
force of this thing has been to keep people working, an economic tool;
but behind it, this is a war machine."
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
The gleaming helmet of the "little girl pilot," as the artist calls her,
further links industrial production and military might. The <i>F111</i>
reverberates with the proximity of violence unleashed by distant warfare,
of forces that spare no one, not even innocent children smiling under
shiny hairdryers.
<p>
To return to our opening question, what makes Rosenquist's work so of
the moment? Its continued political relevancy. The reality of nuclear
disaster continues to be upon us, not only in the form of accidents
or potential military confrontation, but in also the dirty bombs of
terrorism. As Rosenquist confirms, "All generations since the first
nuclear bomb was exploded have had to live with that feeling. There
are protests and then they die down. There is nervousness and then that
dies down. There are accidents at nuclear plants and that's shocking,
terrible, and then everyone pretends the problems don't exist."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
In the immediate aftermath of 11 September 2001 (not 9/11&#8212;a
typically high speed, journalistic condensation) Mayor Giuliani
urged New Yorkers to go out and buy, to keep the economy going and
relieve the shock of violence through the reassuring comfort of
habitual consumption. Appealing to Americans' basic instinct for
survival, Giuliani gave new meaning to the phrase <i>shop 'til you
drop</i>. Ultimately Rosenquist's paintings acknowledge the public's
inculcated sense of helplessness, of not being able to see through
to the larger picture, despite the surfeit of information. Blinded by
material comforts and by the conviction that political freedom brings,
we are, in the artist's own words, "like a bug hitting a light bulb
. . . we keep making the same mistakes, over and over again."

"The Brothel-without-Walls" serves as the chapter epitaph on "The

identify his source for the phrase, p.189: "In a word, photography has
inspired Jean Genet with the theme of the world since photography as a

In 1966 Rosenquist served on a panel discussion with McLuhan in Toronto
along with critic Gene Swenson, who recounted their meeting in Gene
Swenson, "James Rosenquist: The re a Man Makes," <i>The Register of

special issue "Gene Swenson: Retrospective for a Critic," The University
of Kansas, Lawrence, 58. Henceforth abbreviated as "TFAMM." The passage
is worth quoting at length because it is filled with clever allusions
to McLuhan's recent <i>Understanding Media</i>  and offers proof
that both Swenson and Rosenquist were very familiar with McLuhan's
theories, his witticisms, and pronouncement style of writing: "He
brought McLuhan a fly swatter with a plastic sunflower attached to one
of its sides. . . . The sunflower swatter politely but firmly refused,
on more than one level, to convey a message through its medium, at any
rate as I understand that phrase; the message it conveyed as a gift was,
shall we say, tropical. 'Nature,' transformed into a plastic sunflower,
was used to decorate and in some sense modernize an old-fashioned pest
killer. Nature, in the form of a rainstorm, once caused the paper suit
to disintegrate in Japan, leaving the artist high and dry."

Rosenquist alludes to Duchamp's influence in Jeanne Siegel "An

[henceforth abbreviated as "IWJR"] where he also recalls attending a
lecture by Richard Hamilton on Duchamp's "glass piece," <i>The Bride
Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even .</i> On numerous other occasions,
Rosenquist mentions having met Duchamp: for example, in Gene Swenson,
"Social Realism in Blue: An Interview with James Rosenquist," <i>Studio
International</i>175 (February 1968), 79; henceforth abbreviated as
"SRIB." Craig Adcock, "An Interview with James Rosenquist," in <i>James

Michael Lobel argues in <i>Image Duplicator: Roy Lichtenstein and the
Emergence of Pop Art</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 1,
that the esthete Lichtenstein "came to be read as the consummate detached
formalist," and, 23, that he and Warhol "were cast, respectively,
as the good boy and bad boy of Pop art." C&eacute;cile Whiting, <i>A
Taste for Pop: Pop Art, Gender, and Consumer Culture</i> (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1997), 128-32 reads Lichtenstein's public
persona as a renegotiated masculinity &#8212;neither the camp dandy of
Warhol nor the aggressive virility of Pollock,

<b></b>

he represents "both the potentially emasculated" American middle-class
father and the "cerebral, professional" artist. Oddly, despite the title
of her book, Whiting gives no attention to the work of Rosenquist with
its obvious engagement with commodity culture and advertising. On Warhol
see Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley and Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz

In an interview with the artist, Mary Anne Staniszewski, "James
Rosenquist," <i>Bomb</i> 21 (Fall 1987), 29 [henceforth abbreviated
as "JR"] directly addressed the representation of sex in Rosenquist's
pictures: "Do you see your paintings as images of hetero-male desire? In
the Eighties a lot of people might ask those kinds of questions as they
look at your work. Are these paintings directed at a traditional notion
of male desire? Do you ever think about these questions?" The artist
skirted the issue and proceeded to talk about "getting the energy to work"
within the paintings.

Thomas Crow in "Warhol's Saturday Disasters: Trace and Reference in
Early Warhol," in <i>Modern Art and the Common Culture</i> (New Haven:

and disaster have more personal meaning and more social commentary than
are normally credited to the artist.

Here I disagree with Christin J Mamiya in <i>Pop Art and Consumer
Culture. American Super Market</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press,
1992, [henceforth abbreviated as <i>PACC</i>] who argues on page 4
that Pop art "ultimately deflected or absorbed social and political
criticism about consumer culture" because it merely reflected the
system and participated in it through its own marketing practices. In
Rosenquist's case, there is no ambiguity; moreover, Mamiya rules
out the possibility of critique from within, a distinct possibility,
given the minimum demarcation between public and private in the late
capitalist period. Mamiya's claim on page 79 that the work of the Pop
artists shows "no visible transformation from news photo to canvas"
is also questionable. Of course, every generation differs as to what
constitutes a politicized art: Rosenquist's contemporaries and his
earliest champions stressed the ideological dimension of his work,
most notably Lawrence Alloway, "Derealized Epic," <i>Artforum</i> 10
(June 1972), 35-41; Gene Swenson in the interviews conducted with the
artist in the 1960s noted below, and in "TFAMM"; and Lucy Lippard,
"James Rosenquist: Aspects of a Multiple Art," <i>Artforum</i> 4
(December 1965), 41-6. The overt protest of Rosenquist's <i>F 111</i>
is researched by Edward Jerome Adler, "American Painting and the Vietnam

Siegel, "IWJR," 32. "There was more throb, more action, and I begin
to think there was more power and more massive things in advertising
than there was in the intellect of a person making a painting in a
studio. Also, I saw soap boxes being designed in advertising agencies
and they used to pin the soap boxes on the walls to see who would look

recollects, "I could paint any kind of advertisement that would sell

that in his <i>Handbook of Consumer Motivations</i>, 246, Ernest Dichter
analyses fishing as a sport that "has retained its traditionally masculine
characteristic"&#8212;it represents the "incomparable thrill of the
actual catch," and "a form of mastering the outside world, comparable
to hunting." Rosenquist also used a bamboo fishing pole in <i>Two 1959
People</i>  and indicates the use of one in the source collage
for<i>Morning Sun</i>  although it does not appear in the final
version.

The source materials derives from a feature article on Truman's ties,

(10 December 1951), 67. The text reads in part: "Experts may carp, but
HST has become a better dressed man. . . . " His ties from 1938 to 1951
"show no particular trend toward conservatism. He wore quiet ones as a

my eye, I would attach it to the wall. I saw a picture of telephone
executives in a magazine, so I erased all their faces. They looked
like eggs in a carton. It was a kind of autobiographical answer to
'What am I doing here?'" In a recent interview with Julia Blaut, in his

James Rosenquist by G.R. Swenson," <i>Partisan Review</i>32 (Fall 1965),
595 [henceforth abbreviated as "TF111"]: "If a company or institution is
using people like digits and massing them in schools of learning towards
appreciating new ideas and new inventions, I react to that and try to

Rosenquist cited in Swenson, "SRIB," 80 in reference to a picture "with
a rug and a hand." The canvas in question may be <i>Taxi</i>
with its fragmented image of a hand running its fingers through the
deep pile of grass, although the "itinerant image of home-sweet-home"
is equally applicable to <i>Nomad</i>. As Gitlin argues in <i>Media
Unlimited</i>, 59 and 107, "nomadicity" is also the condition of the
electronic information age, since we are "never away but always at home";
moreover "the fully equipped nomad, seeking freedom of access at will,
becomes fully accessible to other people's wills."

realism. . . . what reflects from the screen is shadow play. . . . Nowhere
in its mechanical process does the camera hold either mirror or candle
to nature. . . . it remains a fabricator of a visual language, no less a
linguist than the typewriter." Fred Camper "Brakhage's Contradictions,"

,</i> McLuhan writes of the "Ballet Luce," (<i>Time, Fortune and Life</i>)
that they shape a new set of attitudes and "wallop the subconscious"
without appearing to do. His finest lines are reserved for <i>Life</i>,
11: "The initial layout consisted of heavy doses of pictorial violence,
mayhem, and death plus equally heavy rations of strip tease (in ads and
news alike), plus a wodge of pseudo-science in the form of pictorialized
'wonders of modern science.' Girlie art remains the heavy staple, but
violence and mayhem have been somewhat reduced and religious art given
a place beside pseudo-science. The twenty million or more <i>Life</i>
readers are not given the same encouragement to think of themselves as
a tight little club of knowing sophisticates as are Timereaders."

In "TF111," 599, Rosenquist states: "To me it's now a generation removed,
the post-Beat young people. They're not afraid of an atomic war and think
that sort of attitude is pass&eacute;, that it won't occur. The Beat
people, like Kerouac and Robert Frank, Dick Bellamy, Ginsberg and Corso,
their first sensibility was of it being used immediately and they were
hit by the idea of it, they were shocked and sort of threatened. Now
the younger people are blas&eacute; and don't think it can happen. So
this is a restatement of that Beat idea, but in full color." The artist
also mentions his personal contacts with the Beats in Staniszewski,

In "TF111," 596, the artist recalls his wallpaper roller technique, used
first in <i>Silver Skies :</i> "I saw the pattern in an elevator lobby
and thought of a solid atmosphere; you walk outside of your apartment
into what used to be open air and all of a sudden feel that it has become
solid with radioactivity and other undesirable elements." In the same
interview Rosenquist goes on, 599, to discuss the umbrella imagery in
the F111, though it is equally applicable to its initial appearance in
<i>A Lot to Like</i>. Swenson asks: "Is that about fallout?" to which
the artist replies, "I suppose the umbrella could be something about
fallout, but for me it's like someone raising his umbrella or raising
his window in the morning; looking out the window and seeing a bright
red and yellow atomic bomb blast, something like a cherry blossom,
a beautiful view of an atomic blast. . . . The umbrella is realistic,
it's a realistic vision, with frost or snow on top of it." Hiroshige's
<i>Fifty-three Stations on the Tokaido</i>was published in 1833-1835
and contains numerous scenes of umbrellas in wind, rain, and snow.
