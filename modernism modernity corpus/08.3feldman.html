Victorian Modernism

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Artists and critics alike view high modernism within scenes of rupture
and yearning. Even when artists vigorously stage "the new," anxiety and
nostalgia shade desire. Wallace Stevens's "poem of the mind in the act
of finding / What will suffice" once the past becomes "souvenir" conveys
this need for a modernist rescue operation in a present defined by loss.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Modernist writers, as we often acknowledge in one way or another,
  want to separate themselves and their work from the recent past as
  well as from other modernist writers and to preclude the possibility
  of rescue from their thrilling and despairing isolation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To this understanding of literary modernism, we must add the idea
that modernists were interested not just in rupture, but also in
continuity, and specifically in continuities with the Victorian period,
1837-1901. We must try to hear, within the rallying cry of "make
it new," the harmonic of "preserve it through change." It is important
to tell critical stories of both destruction <I>and</I> preservation,
and one way to do so is to bring the mid-century, high Victorian into
relation with high modernism. As we do, a Victorian modernist aesthetic
of both rupture and continuity, of stark differences and relations across
gaps, develops.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Studying Victorian modernism, we learn to consider works of art
as webs of relations and ideas with multiple centers and gaps,
a filigree-in-progress. Or, in weightier terms, we should learn
to pay attention to collections of things, arranged but subject to
rearrangement. In parallel, our critical goal must be to chart coherences
that begin and end with critical venturings from divers centers. As we
shall see, George Eliot writes of "multiplex"

<B></B>

structures, and William James of "concatenated unions." Both urge us to
consider delicate and complicated structures, not solid blocks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Victorian modernist criticism might speak of seeming solidities,
for example, "the modern epic" or "the New Woman novel." But like
the structural designs of buildings that John Ruskin often found less
interesting than their surface ornamentations, the solidities such studies
describe exist for the intermingling patterns they make possible, not
the patterns for the solidities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  The house of modernism may be aggressively streamlined or built anew;
  but it also embraces yesterday's house, absorbing the patterned
  bric-&agrave;-brac of the Victorian parlor and carefully rearranging
  it. It is no accident that, in examining the cozy and ornamented
  characteristics of Victorian art and literature, we will see that
  nineteenth-century domestic and sentimental novelists in both Great
  Britain and the United States were engaged in creating works taken up by
  twentieth-century modernist writers, high and low. Indeed, distinctions
  between high and low or serious novels and domestic novels no longer
  serve us well. Henry James was a domestic novelist just as surely
  as Elizabeth Stoddard wrote difficult, impressionist, experimental
  prose. This connection is not meant simply to redraw the lines of
  recent literary history, but rather to challenge a central truism
  of literary study: that modernist writers, beginning in the 1890s,
  made an art that clearly departed from what had come immediately before.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But why posit Victorian modernism in the first place? One answer--that
some modernist artists themselves did so--may be exemplified by
William Butler Yeats's "Introduction" to his anthology, <I>The Oxford
Book of Modern Verse, 1892-1935.</I> In their darker tableaux,
modernist artists--and Yeats is no exception--often choose rupture as
an alternative to repeating now emptied forms of the recent past. Yet
when modernist writers insist upon radical discontinuity, we should not
take them at their word. We should examine those words and the resulting
works of art carefully, because Victorian practices often vitally inform
modernist works. What is dismissed is also summoned. Yeats, for example,
in writing the introduction to his anthology, describes the advent of the
"modern" as the "wringing [of] the neck of rhetoric." It appears that
Victorian poetic practices had to die in order that modernism could be
born. Nothing less than revolution would do:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The revolt against Victorianism meant to the young poet a revolt against
irrelevant descriptions of nature, the scientific and moral discursiveness
of <I>In Memoriam</I>--"When he should have been broken-hearted",
said Verlaine, "he had many reminiscences"--the political eloquence of
Swinburne, the psychological curiosity of Browning, and the poetical
diction of everybody.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We should not blind ourselves, however, to the fact that such revolt
is only part of Yeats's programme for modernist poetry. Yeats weaves a
contrasting tale throughout this very introduction that has gone largely
unnoticed by scholars of modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yeats's poetic manifestoqua introduction not only announces a break with
Victorianisms but also embraces them. In the very sentence in which
Yeats states that young poets believe that discursiveness must go,
he discursively interrupts the rhythm

<B></B>

of his sentence to quote Verlaine--as if to challenge in expansive
prose the chiseled reticencies of modern poetry. He tells us that
modern poets dismiss rhetoric, yet the force of this statement depends
on the ornate parallelisms of its lists and the satisfactions of its
rhythms. In substance, too, Yeats argues with himself. Although the
passage describes rupture from Tennyson, Swinburne, and Browning, Yeats
continues to reject <I>and embrace</I> so-called Victorian discursiveness,
eloquence, curiosity, and poetical diction as he describes modern poets
and poetry worthy of our admiration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He tells us that Walter Pater's "pure gem-like flame" [<I>sic</I>] gave
modern poets an alternative to moral earnestness and a desire to "purify
poetry of all that is not poetry" but--and here it's important to keep
reading--that these poets found the flame "was an insufficient motive." As
the essay proceeds, Yeats establishes a shimmering ironic stance conveying
dual desires: simplification and complication, concentered gem-like flames
and unruly flights and divergences. Increasingly calling into question
the efficacy of attacking things Victorian as a way of setting modernist
poetry apart, Yeats insists, "When my generation denounced scientific
humanitarian pre-occupation, psychological curiosity, rhetoric, we had
not found what ailed Victorian literature. The Elizabethans had all
these things, especially rhetoric" (<I>OMV,</I> xvii).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So what did call for amendment in poetry, if it wasn't Victorianisms
per se? For Yeats the answer seems to lie in the need for passion--and
he proceeds, in this argument with himself, to find such passion
<I>precisely in Victorian poets and poems.</I> Modern poets, he argues,
must revivify people and poetry that have become too passive, wrest
control of events and speak for the mind's "responsibility." Intellectual
passion and engagement must have their day as "man's naked mind" claims
its place (<I>OMV,</I> xxviii, xxix). Along with the Victorian virtue
of responsibility, other aspects of Victorian poetic culture appeal
to Yeats--his own taste (which he attributes to his Irish nationality)
tends not to man's naked mind but to "a man so many years old, fixed to
some one place, known to friends and enemies, full of mortal frailty,
expressing all things not made mysterious by nature with impatient
clarity" (<I>OMV,</I> xxxvii). The modernist sage of 1935 might have
been describing a Victorian triple-decker novel, with its social world
represented in painstaking detail.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The differences between "them," the modern poets, and himself, the always
respectful Victorian modernist (Irish) outsider to modernism, accumulate
throughout the essay. The modernists, Yeats tells us, may look for hard,
positive subject matter and an avoidance of political ranting in poetry
or in Trafalgar Square, but he prefers a poetry of passionate politics,
a poetics of the heart. When in 1900, "everybody got down off his stilts
and Victorianism had been defeated," the modern movement, in Yeats's
view, was fruitfully dominated by two late Victorian writers, Rudyard
Kipling and William Watson, "who had never heard of that defeat or did
not believe in it"(<I>OMV,</I> xi-xii).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why have Yeats's own Victorian passions been all but invisible to the
central narrative of modernist literary study? And what will we begin
to see once we seek the Victorian in the modern? The answers to those
questions will, of course, depend on one's own modernism, since there
is so little agreement about modern literature's formal qualities, its
decade of origin, its longevity, and its groupings of artists and texts--

<B></B>

whether generic, national, philosophical, or historical. Yet as Stevens
says, "It is time to choose," and so we shall. One conception of modernism
calling for revision often goes by the name "high modernism," and its
dates are roughly 1880-1945. It features a literary work whose
mask of darkness and suffering may be flipped to reveal the mask of a
retrieved Romantic, visionary illumination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conceived in a time of spiritual crisis, such "anti-Victorian" modernist
art communicates an exile from the homeland of certainty as it sits high
on the shelf of autonomous art. An object to be admired, or in some cases
excoriated, for its self-sufficiency and self-involvement, the modern
work is purely sculpted, durably masculine, paradoxically spiritual
or cerebral for all its hardness, and preferably not for sale. Its
internal incoherencies are bounded by its autonomy, made whole by its
separation from the familiar. It takes the long and impersonal view,
turning away from the ordinary and the fleshly, the vulgarly emotional
and the preachy. One must work hard to understand and appreciate such
a modernist work of art, and most people will fail to do so.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What happened between Romanticism and modernism--namely, the mid-century
Victorian--has been largely left out of the story. This is not to claim
that there are no studies of mid-nineteenth-century writers with modernist
desires, or of modernist writers with ties to that portion of the literary
past lying between the Romantics and the turn of the century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Rather, it is to say that the task of integrating the two is far from
  complete, and that we as modernists should become self-consciously
  intradisciplinary<I>.</I> Over specialization, in particular the
  periodization of literary study, has narrowed our view for better
  and worse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This modernist portrait, like all composites, presents a being that
never existed. It is nonetheless one that we shall choose to take
down and handle in order to move toward a conception of Victorian
modernism. Chronologies of modernism often begin at the turn of the
century, as the airless Victorian parlor, filled with bric-&agrave;-brac,
is replaced by the "Aesthetic suite" of decadence, mysteriously layered
with exotic objects and moody atmospheres. This is replaced in turn by
the modernist "living space," cleared of conflicting patterns and sleek
in its functional elegance. The chronology of Victorian modernism, in
contrast, imagines these three periods as gathered into an incomplete
unity because they share important ideas about artists, works of art,
and audiences. Aesthetic notions and artistic practices intermingle,
entwine; or they flow and pool, even metamorphose, one into the
other. Juxtapositions become intimate relations. Phenomena of rupture
and loss give way to relation and addition, and the patterns thereby
formed link to other patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Victorians themselves had been pattern-makers, reimagining a Romantic
organic unity as a process of bringing internally linked complexities into
expanding sets of relations with external complexities. George Eliot,
for example, describes artistic form as a process of knowledge that
grows "by its alternating processes of distinction and combination,"
arriving at the "conception of wholes composed of parts more and more
multiplied and highly differenced." Multiple wholes are themselves
internally multiple, and the highest form in art involves "the relation
of multiplex interdependent parts to a whole which is itself in the most
varied and therefore the fullest relation to

<B></B>

other wholes." The best artistic form creates not a monistic unity of
through-and-through synthesis, but something more complicated: "The most
varied group of relations bound together in a wholeness which again has
the most varied relations with all other phenomena."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Eliot imagines is echoed by the modernist William James, in part
because he came of age in a Victorian household. Eliot's multiplex
interdependencies become James's "concatenated union" as he describes

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the world . . . as a collection, some parts of which are conjunctively
and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves disjoined,
may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which they are
severally connected, and the whole world eventually may hang together
similarly, inasmuch as <I>some</I> path of conjunctive transition by which
to pass from one of its parts to another may always be discernible. Such
determinately various hanging-together may be called <I>concatenated</I>
union, to distinguish it from the "through-and-through" type of union,
"each in all and all in each". . . which monistic systems hold to obtain
when things are taken in their absolute reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
George Eliot emphasizes the wholes, James the transitions between and
within them, but they share a notion of incomplete completions, multiple
and multiply connected centers, and discontinuous continuities. Yeats,
too, describes "the ultimate reality" as "neither one nor many, concord
nor discord," the tertium quid, as it were, of all antinomies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, this essay's exemplary re of Victorian
modernism, embodies these notions in the patterns of his daily life
which are complexly linked to the patterns and arrangements of his
artistic creation. The "multiplied and highly differenced" arrangements
and rearrangements within his painting and poetry are akin--in the full
sense of the word "kin"--to the interior decoration of his London house at
16 Cheyne Walk. This is the representative story of Victorian modernism
that I will tell. But first, a brief look backward, to an <I>eclipse</I>
of Romantic Imagination that made modernism possible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Concatenated unions or multiplex relations have a Romantic pedigree of
inferiority that goes by the name of Fancy. For the Romantics, Imagination
trumps Fancy, because it allows the artist to work as a divinely creative
force. The Victorian modernists' Romantic forebear, Coleridge, describes
the supreme, God-the-Father-like powers of the Secondary Imagination. He
even coins a term, <I>esemplastic</I> (to shape into one), both to
describe such imagination and to enact it as he collapses two Greek words
into one "Angloid" word. The Secondary Imagination "dissolves, diffuses,
dissipates, in order to re-create . . . struggles to idealize and to
unify. It is essentially <I>vital,</I> even as all objects (<I>as</I>
objects) are essentially dead and fixed." In contrast to Imagination,
<I>Fancy</I> is of the kingdom of death, for it "has no other counters
to play with, but fixities and definites . . . [like ordinary memory]
the Fancy must receive all its materials ready made from the law of
association."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Fancy is, as it were, the interior decorator of the art world--it never
  creates from unformed matter paintings or poems of the first order,
  but merely rearranges existing artistic furniture. Surely, the moving
  of received,

<B></B>

dead objects about is--in comparison to the vast seminal power of the
unifying and idealizing Imagination--woman's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet through the rearranging energies of a latter-day Fancy, modernist
writers such as Marcel Proust, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, William
Butler Yeats, and James Joyce brought dead objects back to life: railroad
timetables, cracked teacups, golden bowls, heather-mixture stockings,
Connemara cloth, vaseline and orangeflowers. And they moved these fixities
about not just as objects, but as objects that require us to rethink the
nature of artistic unity as we come to grasp the Victorians' avant-garde
notions of discontinuous continuity. Gertrude Stein's patterns of words
on a page <I>as objects on a page</I> continue this tradition: "What does
literature do and how does it do it. And what does English literature do
and how does it do it. And what ways does it use to do what it does do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fancy has its own power of life in Victorian modernism, and once we
reassess its value, hitherto marginalized texts of many kinds will
suddenly appear more worthy of study. For example, mid-nineteenth-century
domestic, sentimental, or highly wrought novels by American women will
come into focus as a center, not the center, of Victorian modernism. Henry
James read widely in such popular fiction, and wrote, for example,
a review of Elizabeth Stoddard's fiction which conveys not just his
dissatisfaction, but also his fascination with the links between his
(high) art and her domestic and sensational fiction. In her children's
tale, <I>Lolly Dinks' Doings</I> , Stoddard tells of a spider fairy
named Fancie who moves in with the Dinks family and enchants them with
her miniature domestic arrangements. Fancie is kin to the "little airs"
who explore the Ramseys' abandoned house in Woolf's novel of aesthetic
domesticity, and who "all sighed together, all together gave off an
aimless gust of lamentation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Summoned home to fairyland, Fancie tells Mrs. Dinks what she will miss:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

"And dust, cinders; above all the human-crowd smell. I am not quite sure
how I can get out of the tangle in your air of human speech. Missis,
I see a thousand curves and threads crossing each other, making a great
web, that rises and rises like a balloon in the sky. It is all words;
and where is it trying to get to?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fancie takes a ride on the back of the pet bird, "up and down my new
chintz lambrequins." She calls out, "Am I high enough for your heaven,

<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Stoddard asks directly in <I>Lolly Dinks' Doings</I> whether fancy
  (Fancie) can get to heaven. It (she) cannot, but instead locates a new
  kind of earthly transcendence in the heights of lambrequins, in the
  chintz patterns of a domestic scene that Mrs. Dalloway herself would
  have recognized, and in a web of human speech akin to that which Joyce
  offered to Stephen Dedalus as he tried for heaven but never arrived.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, the very notion of decorative art, ornamentation and detail
work--as opposed to one central infusion of breath that, like God creating
the world, makes a work whole--has a gendered history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  To the extent that detailed ornamentation can obscure

<B></B>

the central subject, or even take on an important life of its own,
to decorate or ornament is intrinsically to challenge the notion
of unified, mastering form. When Adolph Loos writes of the crime of
ornament and captures the spirit of high modernism by articulating a
coolly functional aesthetic of purity, he has repressed, but not erased,
Victorian plenitude.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the notions of fancy, concatenation, or multiplexity are to be useful,
they must place us on paths that lead somewhere, to borrow an image from
William James's <I>Pragmatism.</I> In one of the earliest treatises
on aesthetics that we have, Alexander Baumgarten's "<I>Reflections on
Poetry</I>" , we read that "The more that is gathered together in
a confused representation, the more extensive clarity the representation
has."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Baumgarten articulates a central finding of Victorian modernism:
  mixings, minglings, and confusions within the home as well as between
  homemaking and art-making, may yield clarity. Again, it is time to
  choose. Let us start down the path that links Dante Gabriel Rossetti's
  artistic practice with his actual domestic arrangements. Rossetti
  was a man who knew his lambrequins, and who--in poems, paintings,
  and rooms alike--assembled bric-&agrave;-brac.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

Rossetti at 16 Cheyne Walk
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti moved among a confusion of categories
that nevertheless, to borrow William James's phrase, hung together. First,
he decorated the interiors of his homes, most notably that of 16 Cheyne
Walk, Chelsea. Second, he depicted, intensely and repeatedly, domestic
spaces and objects in both his poetry and his painting: bedrooms, halls,
sitting rooms; nests, bowers, cages; windows, doors, thresholds; cups,
washbasins, chairs, cabinets, screens, and mirrors. His "fine art" on
its face represents a choice of spaces and things resolutely quotidian in
nature, if frequently exoticized. Third, and in a sense encompassing these
two domestic exercises, Rossetti passionately made "arrangements" with
paint, words, and people. "Applied" art (interior decoration, crafts),
"high" art (painting, poetry) and "household" art (practical affairs
of home, hospitality)--these three arenas of aesthetic arrangement
intermingled in Rossetti's creative life, fueled by tender sentiments
as well as by pain and fear.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti lived at 16 Cheyne Walk from 1862 until his death in 1882. To
understand his house, by many accounts strangely or fascinatingly
decorated, and to appreciate its relation to his painting and poetry, we
should begin with a few facts, consider a few legends, and then examine
some of the best evidence we have of its appearance: the catalog of its
contents printed for the auction held shortly after his death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The London City Council tells us that the house, Georgian in style, was
built in 1717, that it was called Queen's House because of its association
with the flight of Queen Catherine Parr on the death of Henry VIII, and
that it has especially well-preserved and beautifully wrought ironwork.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Rossetti's studio evidently occupied the dining room on the ground
  floor; a vast drawing room on the first floor runs along the entire
  front of the house, and the second floor is primarily given over
  to bedrooms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Judging by exterior and interior Council photographs, the house is
  large and

<B></B>

elegant, a gentleman's residence. In addition to these photographs,
we have paintings by Treffry Dunn of the studio, dining room, drawing
room, and--reflected by one of Rossetti's many convex mirrors--part of
his bedroom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  Most of Rossetti's friends mention aspects of the house; but George
  Meredith, T. Hall Caine, Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton, William Michael
  Rossetti, and Dunn provide the fullest accounts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Descriptions of 16 Cheyne Walk have tended to focus on the mysterious
quality of its bedrooms, probably because the concept of the Gothic was
most available as a descriptive device for the house's hodgepodge of
strange furnishings. Watts-Dunton writes that the guest bedroom where
he frequently slept

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

got the reputation of being haunted; for it was hung about with sombre
hangings and antique picture panels. . . . Scattered about the room
in most admired disorder were some outlandish and unheard-of books,
and all kinds of antiquarian and Oriental oddities, which books and
oddities Rossetti had picked up at various times during his ramblings
about Chelsea and elsewhere--such as old carved heads and grinning
gargoyles, and Burmese and Chinese Buddhas in soapstone of every degree
of placid ugliness. . . . Rossetti's own bedroom was scarcely less weird
in character. There again were to be seen heavy curtains drawn closely
around an antiquated four-post bedstead. . . .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Caine writes a similar description; Dunn bewails the unhealthy darkness,
airlessness, and gruesome pictures of the bedrooms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the rest of the house strikes Dunn as, above all, filled with
interesting and beautiful objects, which he breathlessly catalogs:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The mantelpiece was a most original compound of Chinese black-laquered
[<I>sic</I>] panels, bearing designs of birds, animals, flowers and
fruit in gold relief, which had a very good effect, and on either side of
the grate a series of old blue Dutch tiles, mostly displaying Biblical
subjects treated in the serio-comic fashion that existed at the period,
were inlaid. The fire-grate itself was a beautifully-wrought example
of eighteenth century design and workmanship in brass . . . in one
corner of the room stood an old English china cupboard, inside of which
was displayed a quantity of Spode ware. I sat down on a cosy little
sofa. . . . [<I>RDR,</I> 17-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Dunn as he awaits his first glimpse of the great man, others describe
coziness rather than Gothic horror. William Rossetti perhaps sums up
this position when he passes judgment on the house: "old-fashioned,
many-roomed, homelike, and comfortable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  After looking at Dunn's paintings, a comparatively recent critic, Mario
  Praz (himself a house-obsessed man), complains of the eclecticism of
  Rossetti's house: "in the end there was no style at all. Non-style
  was created from an excess of styles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  When the texture of Victorian eclecticism becomes extreme, it shades
  into modernist minimalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The common observation among these varying assessments is of the striking
number and variety of decorative things in Rossetti's house. These he
collected (in excursions ranging from the elegance of Murray Marks's
premises to the junk shops of the East End), received as gifts, ordered
to specification, and sometimes made himself. To explore this pattern,
we can consider primarily the auction catalog, with a bit of contextual

<B></B>

help from Dunn's paintings. An impressionistic perspective is helpful
here, not only because consideration of the material history of Rossetti's
belongings is beyond the scope of this study, but also because there is no
evidence to suggest that Rossetti considered himself an expert in anything
but blue and white china. He bought what he liked, and the evidence
suggests a happily roving rather than a professionally focused taste. Even
allowing for the randomness of anyone's household belongings, the list
of Rossetti's household effects indicates an aesthetic of incoherence,
repetition, and complication: all qualities that have been remarked
within autonomous modernist works--think of <I>The Waste Land</I>--even
as we have insisted that they represented a break with the Victorian past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Almost everything in the house is out of context, collected from other
places, times, and cultures. One particularly intriguing page of the
catalog lists Indian, Japanese, Albanian, Venetian, Chinese, and Irish
objects. Perhaps the candidate for the most stunning example of the
unassimilated "other" would be a foreign object that also announces
itself as freakish: "A curiously carved mahogany frame chair with cane
seat, formerly belonging to the Chinese Giant 'Chang'" (<I>VCR,</I>
no. 104). At the same time, Dunn's paintings of Rossetti's house portray a
mood of serenity and sumptuous ease. How to reconcile these two accounts?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps this sense of order issues from the very quality of confusion,
or mingling, which these objects possess, in both their internal and
external multiplexities, to borrow George Eliot's term. Rossetti's
arrangements of these objects within the rooms of his house throw the
sentimental context of "home" into high relief. We might say that feeling
provides the energy that draws them into patterns. Rossetti liked, even
adored, these things--his feelings about them provide the only aesthetic
principle informing his acts of acquisition and arrangement. Many parts
are here gathered, however loosely, into a whole. Certainly that is one
tide of energy within 16 Cheyne Walk. But complication within individual
objects can create confusing crosscurrents. The Elgin Marbles these are
not. Consider "Pair of Chinese antique girandoles [the very descriptive
terminology appears to fail], fitted with 4 shelves each, elaborately
carved and heavily gilt" (<I>VCR</I>, no. 257). Or "A very handsome
plated centre stand, inlaid with reflected glass, fitted at the ends
with 3-light candelabra with serpentine arms, the centre supporting a
cut glass flower dish" (<I>VCR,</I> no. 400). Rossetti liked this kind
of complexity: such an item sits quietly, yet scintillates with multiple
shapes and reflections.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And he liked repetition as well. Although classification can be a
problem, a conservative count of items in the catalog reveals twenty-five
cabinets, chests, and cupboards, and thirty-one glasses and mirrors. Such
repetition--think of Stein's "otherwise there is a pleasure in adding / a
doubling of their plan. / They will add adding to their tender care"--has,
like incoherence within a house, two contesting qualities (<I>W,</I>
116). Mirrors everywhere indicate either a comforting similarity or an
unnerving replication both of the mirrors themselves and the scenes they
endlessly reflect. They can make us feel at home, eerily unhoused, or even
entrapped. As for the cabinets, the issue is not just numbers--after all,
this era antedates the built-in closet. Most of these cabinets, however,
have interior shelves and drawers enclosed by highly decorated folding

<B></B>

doors in various arrangements. Within cabinets are smaller enclosures,
themselves holding discrete items, repetition within repetition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such proliferation makes of Rossetti's house a patchwork of borrowings
that announce both their common ground (they rest with a sigh in the
sentimental space of the Victorian middle-class home) and a nervous,
modern sense of contingency. Furthermore, his house is in flux as items
come and go, or are moved about: what Elizabeth Bishop, in a poem about
fishhouses at the water's edge, would call knowledge itself, "flowing
and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  Even the status of items within the house can never be clear. How
  heavily carved or exquisitely veneered must a chest be before it
  metamorphoses from storage bin to <I>objet</I>? Or perhaps at the
  very limits of artful impracticality the ordinary suddenly reappears:
  "A curious cabinet of Burmese glass workmanship, having grotesque
  res, with stand for same (suitable for a hall as a receptacle for
  carriage rugs)" (<I>VCR,</I> no. 217).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such complexities will yield clarity once we learn their syntax. To do
so, we must take seriously Rossetti's carefully arranged relations to
other people, those relations interwining with the various uses of 16
Cheyne Walk: studio, gallery, literary salon, family home, stage set,
and shelter from nature. Things, people, and works of art together form
a rich confusion, "a collection, some parts of which are conjunctively
and others disjunctively related."

Consider, for example, the hawthorn pot in Rossetti's painting <I>Monna
Rosa</I> (<A HREF="8.3feldman_1.html">1</A>), a bit of the "blue and white" china that has become
the emblem of aestheticism itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  Our understanding of the painting might begin with a formalist
  appreciation of the pot's decorative texture in relation to res on
  the woman's robe and the background of peacock feathers and roses. We
  might then proceed to an appreciation of the pot as an incipiently
  Symbolist image of imagination and artisanry, and from there to a
  consideration of the woman herself as a beautiful, "vital object"
  and so on. But we should also attend to the aesthetic arrangements
  Rossetti made beyond the painting's frame, at the center of which
  the pot still beautifully rests. Rossetti's carefully cultivated and
  deeply affectionate relationship with the art dealer and collector
  Murray Marks, one of his principal suppliers of oriental ware; his
  own collector's obsession that led him to entertain other collectors
  at dinner and thus to people his solitude meaningfully; his feeling
  that an earlier and better culture of beauty and virtue inhabits the
  hawthorn pot, and his belief that such significant beauty can be placed
  both in his home and on his canvases (themselves to be placed in homes,
  not public galleries): all these and other arrangements must inform our
  appreciation of <I>Monna Rosa</I> precisely because Rossetti painted
  and lived them simultaneously, interchangeably.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Above all, the hawthorn pot reminds us that translation is one of
Rossetti's defining practices, as it will be for Ezra Pound. The "bringing
home" or domesticating of foreign speech is central to Rossetti's intense
practice of domestic aestheticism. He translated not only Italian poetry
into English poetry, but also real Chinese pots (already translated from
the Chinese when Rossetti named them "hawthorn") into items of English
domesticity--part of the ensemble of his sitting room--and then into
painted pots, themselves carefully placed in painted bowers and rooms.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Just as a vase could be bought and sold in the marketplace, used to
develop relations with other people, treasured for its living qualities,
transformed into a painted vase, and placed, beautifully, on a real shelf
in a real house as part of ongoing domestic arrangements, so people, too,
could be patterned into art at the same time as they worked in his home,
itself an artistic studio and work of art. For Rossetti, objects were
not, as Coleridge programmatically states, dead. Rossetti understood the
"vital" as a

<B></B>

free-floating energy that can infuse (and ebb from) people, objects,
rooms, paintings, and poems alike, as he arranged them in complex
patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti conducted daily household affairs because he had to, and since
he worked at home, his domestic concerns and his artistic practice
blended. Like many a middle-class and upper-class Victorian woman,
he felt harassed by the "servant problem." But for him the issue had a
twist: he continually felt the lack of models, and sought them either on
the street (the "stunners" were both sexual and artistic prey) or among
the serving class. "What I really want," he writes to Mrs. Alexander
Gilchrist, who has been advising him on the servant issue, "is a very
handy man or youth, capable of turning his hand to odd jobs of carpentry,
etc. . . . another desirable quality would be that he should be fit for
a model" (<I>LDR,</I> 483). Just as such a handyman must be fit to enter
the studio, so the women hired as models must be fit for the workroom;
he requests, for example, that Alexa Wilding mend the fabric and then
remake the dress to be worn as she sits to him. Fanny Cornforth acts not
only as model, but also as housekeeper, for several years. At Kelmscott
Manor a local serving girl becomes the model for <I>Marigolds.</I>
A curious circularity of domestic and artistic activity develops. As
completed paintings are sold and money flows in, it must be disbursed
to cover household and studio expenses. Such expenses make it possible
for the next painting to be completed, but also bring on the next round
of bills for canvas, paint, artists' dinners, and models'/servants' wages.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the course of the years, Rossetti engaged three men to ease his dual
domestic and aesthetic burdens: W. J. Knewstub, Dunn and, toward the end,
Caine. Rossetti required Dunn, in particular, to find his way among the
complexities of a household that was part nest, part artistic factory
(with himself the principal pieceworker) and part artistic salon<I>.</I>
Dunn's memoirs indicate his initial enthusiasm for the job of artistic
factotum, because he feels at last that he is entering the world of London
art. He reminisces about a particularly vivid scene of domestic sublimity
that takes place in Rossetti's studio as a thunderstorm crescendos,
and with it, Swinburne's verse declamation:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Faint electric sparks played round the wavy masses of his luxuriant
hair. . . . I lay in the sofa in a corner of the studio and listened
in wonder . . . for it appeared to me as though the very res in the
pictures that were on the easels standing about the room were conscious
of and sympathised with the poet. . . . The 'Proserpine' gazed out more
mournfully than I had been wont to see her gaze. [<I>RDR,</I> 64]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dunn understands that the vibrations of weather (brought indoors),
fellowship (Rossetti returns soon after, and he and Swinburne sit up
until dawn together), and works of art (conscient) lead, one to the
other, at 16 Cheyne Walk. He not only fabricates frames, scale models,
and drawings to Rossetti's specifications, but also shops for artistic
props, advises Rossetti on appropriate household budgets, and searches
the house for misplaced items during his employer's absences. He absorbs
visits from angry merchants, kills rats, mails information, books, and
furniture, and even goes house-hunting for Rossetti, making sketches of
promising properties. But all of his activities require of him artistic

<B></B>

talent, aesthetic judgment, and sympathy with his artist-employer's
special needs. Spaces must be filled with appropriate light, objects
must be located or bid upon, projects must be finished so that "tin"
for Dunn's, at best, intermittent salary might be forthcoming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the term exploitation comes to mind, it is important to remember
that Rossetti himself never drew a sharp line between work on paintings
and domestic concerns. William finds in his brother's writing book the
following contiguous scraps:

The slimming man and the accomplished artist are one. Domestic upsets
easily became artistic incidents--such as Fanny's alleged breakage (or
hiding) of a blue and white jar he needs for a painting. A misplaced
medieval costume means a slowdown in work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Household matters, however, may also have unexpected value for artistic
work. When Rossetti receives a sofa ordered through Howell, he discovers
it "covered with the most lovely chintz of a Japanese pattern admirably
designed and coloured like greyish blue china" (<I>LDR,</I> 1205). To
pay for actual blue and white china--cherished as decoration for both
paintings and living quarters--he paints a picture, and makes it worth
&#163;200 "to cover a previous account" (<I>RP,</I> 62, 70). It is
perhaps only part of the story to say that Rossetti knew at heart that
he had "sold out" as an artist by engaging in the impure world of the
marketplace. If he sold out, he also, as homemaker, bought in. Pots,
paintings, sofas, pounds sterling, models, dresses, create a complicated
pattern. To keep house, however frantically, is to manage affairs in
the name of beauty--the hallmark of modernist aestheticism. And to write
poetry is to make aesthetic arrangements that include, as part of their
very composition, personal and domestic arrangements.

 "Look that it be, / Whether for lustral rite or dire portent, / Of its
 own arduous fulness reverent": Rossetti includes as the aims of poetry
 the creation of an autonomous object <I>and the care of art's readers</I>
 by purification, illumination, and warning--and all this by placing them
 in the presence of special, even magical objects. As Rossetti invited
 poets into his company, he wrote sonnets in order to bring his poetry
 into a community of readers. The view of art as "lustral rite" bespeaks a
 cyclical process (the lustrum was originally conducted every five years
 by the censors at Rome), meant to purify a people, a piece of land, or
 even the community's home, the city. A ritual cleansing, it conducts us
 to the realm of the spiritualized domestic. Sonnets themselves become the
 objects used in lustral rites or as dire portents; they must be carved,
 decorated things. In fact, the sonnet as Rossetti conceives it is another
 "medley of bric-&agrave;-brac" like that of the paintings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Sonnet" is, to summarize, arduously full, carved in ivory or ebony
with a flowered and impearled crest, and also rounded, flattish, and
engraved differently on each side. Such a medley, whether it appear in a
sonnet or a painting, might then be recognized for what it is: the modern
jumble of life sanctified, arranged by the artist-priest-householder
(or, later, by Stevens's "Man on the Dump") into an intimacy of related
aspects rather than an organically conceived unity. Details and ornaments
cannot be clearly distinguished from the things themselves (who can tell
the engraving from the coin?), and we feel ourselves moving toward an
abstraction of texture that signals the presence of the modern. As David
G. Riede acutely notes, "the paradox is that [Rossetti] consistently
saw surfaces as the most profound symbols of emotional and psychological
depths.<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, when it came to composing poetry--arranging words,
images, and sounds artfully--Rossetti retained habits he had formed
as a householder. His writing often involves the actual staging of
complex and artful arrangements of people he knows as he links his
verbal "compositions" to acts of generosity performed or received that
make it possible to paint or write. Simply stated, for Rossetti, the
personal favor becomes an element of creation that works in tandem with
inspiration--his insistence on "fundamental brainwork"--and execution. His
dealings with people can be considered as so many scripted dramas, first
acted, then captured forever in beautiful objects: poems and paintings
which themselves insist on their source in a personal, contingent,
and often sentimental milieux.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Late in life, for example, Rossetti wrote a series of sonnets entitled
"Five English Poets" (<I>CW,</I> 337-9). The sonnet on Blake
exemplifies a confused mirroring of sentimental word and tender action.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here is a confusing field of reflection. This is a poem about an artist
by an artist. It describes the domestic life of Blake--bed, nook,
cupboard, bread--as intimately linked to his "thought-wandering" and to
the speaker's vision of heaven. Artistic creation at home is artistic
creation <I>as</I> home for both Rossetti and his imagined Blake, the
sentimental home-speech that is both human and divine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Less obvious than these echoes and links, however, are the artful
arrangements of Rossetti's life that made this sonnet possible in the
first place. As one artist writing about another, Rossetti does not
address Blake's poetry or pictures directly, nor does he himself visit
Blake's house at 3 Fountain Court. Instead he turns to a "picture by
another artist of a room once inhabited by Blake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Such a choice indicates Rossetti's love of arrangements as part of
  his fascination with domestic scenes. That Frederick Shields probably
  made the sketch after Rossetti suggested he do so; that Shields sent
  him the sketch and the floor plan of the rooms; that Rossetti could
  then reciprocate with the gift of a sonnet based on Shields's gift;
  that both Shields and Rossetti, along with William Michael Rossetti,
  helped the widowed Mrs. Alexander Gilchrist complete her husband's
  <I>Life of William Blake</I>: all of these circumstances speak of
  Rossetti's continual efforts to create bonds of mutual attention
  that would literally make art out of human arrangements as well
  as words. Taking into consideration all these aspects of the poem,
  "inlaid with reflected glass" as it were, we feel the very texture
  of Victorian modernism: complexity so fine-grained that it verges on
  abstraction. And we feel it, too, within Stevens's sentimental elegy
  for George Santayana, so similar to Rossetti's elegy for Blake: "The
  bed, the books, the chair, the moving nuns / The candle as it evades
  the sight" equally acknowledge the vision of "The extreme of the known
  in the presence of the extreme / Of the unknown"(<I>CP,</I> 508).

Domestic arrangements are not the centralizing force of Victorian
modernism; they are but one of its energies. It happens that for Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, such arrangements provide a relational energy that
offers him the experience of--and the words

<B></B>

and images for--a pragmatist and empiricist building out of reality from
the flux. When William James tries to explain the finding and making of
pragmatist truth by the following out of connections, he writes, "If I
am lost in the woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path,
it is of the utmost importance that I should think of a human habitation
at the end of it, for if I do so and follow it, I save myself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  To understand that Victorian "coziness" provides both an actual
  laboratory and a philosophical metaphor for truth in the making that
  pervades art in the twentieth century is to see both "the modern"
  and "the Victorian" in a usefully mingled way. The aesthetic and
  the domestic pragmatically entwine to create an important Victorian
  modernist pattern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti does not, of course, found Victorian modernism. Rather, he
provides for the moment a contingent center from which we might set
out in exploration, and he leads us to reexamine some truths which
might have slipped into truisms. We should question, for example,
the modern conception of the actual Victorian home--as opposed to its
Gothic metamorphoses--as a place of Philistine prejudices, airless
and overstuffed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  That the Victorian parlor, <I>well before the turn of the century,</I>
  might have been a testing ground for modern culture, that it might have
  provided both the space of reaction and the space of rebellion, is a
  possibility we must consider. Within this familiar context, Rossetti
  envisioned the very aesthetic values that would be taken up by decadent
  artists in England and the creators of art nouveau in France and enter
  the mainstream of what we regard as high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The highly particularized, crowded, and flattened surfaces of Rossetti's
paintings, like the abstraction-strewn, sentimental surfaces of his poetry
and the strange decorations of his drawing room, are protomodernist, or
what we should more accurately characterize as Victorian modernist. Modern
artists introduce "ornamental" patterns into paintings and literary works,
such as the decorative borders and actual textile patterns of Matisse, the
patterned furniture of Picasso's portraits, the incantatory repetitions
or iconic images of modernist verse, or the odd collection of objects
in surrealist texts. These works of art represent not a rupture from the
immediate Victorian past, but its flowering. Victorian sensibilities live
a renewed life in modernist art. Because Proust simultaneously describes
in detail the rooms his characters inhabit, depicts remembered rooms,
furnishes the rooms of his capacious sentences, and memorializes the
ornate Gothic buildings beloved of John Ruskin, he invites us to set
out in search of his Victorian modernism. As we do so, we may link
it, perhaps, to Ruskin and through him to the domestic practices of
best-selling American women writers of the nineteenth century. Harriet
Beecher Stowe, Augusta Evans, Elizabeth Stoddard, and many others,
acolytes of Ruskin all, take their place in an emerging filigree of
Victorian modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many are the directions we might take, the writers and works we might
bring into relation, as we explore a literary terrain that is richer
for its detailed, complex, and confused minglings than it ever was
for its clean breaks and firm categories. Overlooked or deliberately
ignored aspects of high modernism will catch the light--for example,
its sentimentality. Old concepts will take on new shapes: perhaps the
sublime is

<B></B>

a phenomenon of Willa Cather's communities on the plains, as much as it is
the effacement of social relations and even human identity before fearsome
mountain peaks or ocean furies. Aesthetics might even pragmatically link
hands with ethics, as we come to see that Stevens's questions of "How
to Live," the adverbial and adjectival styles we adopt, can make their
way toward questions of "What to Do," the actions that make us human
(<I>CP,</I> 125).
