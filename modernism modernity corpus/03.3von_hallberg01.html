<P>
<I>Now and then a critical book appears that attempts to reorient an
entire field; the debates that surround such work are exciting, and
the stakes are high. Walter Benn Michaels's <B>Our America: Nativism,
Modernism, and Pluralism </B>is just such a book. He makes three
important arguments with stunning lucidity: that American literature
of the 1920s followed closely the popular reactions against increased
immigration in the first two decades of the century; that American
modernism was driven by considerations of race and identity more than
of form and representation; that the identitarian and racist views of
culture that developed in the 1920s are the same as those advocated in
debates about identity in the 1990s. Whether one accepts these arguments
or not, Michaels has set new terms in which modern American literature
must be discussed.</I>

<P>
<I>Versions of the following papers were presented at a panel devoted
to this book that I organized for the American Comparative Literature
Association meeting at the University of Notre Dame in April 1996. I am
grateful to Charles Altieri, Walter Benn Michaels, and Marjorie Perloff
for agreeing to meet and argue with each other, and to Krzysztof Ziarek of
Notre Dame for giving us the ACLA forum. A number of people contributed
questions and comments to the debate we started there, and I would like
to thank them for that. I wish that I had found an editorial means
for presenting their remarks here. We've decided instead to present
more formal, extended versions of the comments made at Notre Dame in
the spring.</I>
