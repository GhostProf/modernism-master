<p>In his recent biography of the modernist sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>], Paul O'Keeffe points to a puzzle that continues to baffle historians: what compelling change in perspective would cause a self-declared anti-militarist—whose principled opposition to the French army remained steadfast at least until Spring 1913—to enthusiastically volunteer for service when war broke out in early August 1914?<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Having moved to London from Paris in January 1911, Gaudier-Brzeska rose to prominence after exhibiting his sculpture at the July 1913 Allied Artists Association exhibition; he then befriended the poet Ezra Pound and, in 1914, became a founding member of the English Vorticists. Gaudier contributed a manifesto to the Vorticist's journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> in June 1914 and following his voluntary enlistment in the French army he published a second manifesto written while in the trenches in the July 1915 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span>. The second edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> also included a brief notice, titled "Mort pour la patrie," stating that Gaudier-Brzeska had been killed on June 5, 1915 "after a month of ting and two promotions for gallantry."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's dramatic shift from ardent anti-militarist to an enthusiastic wartime combatant seems all the more perplexing given his pre-war commitment to anarchism and the role played by the anti-militarist, anarchist-oriented journals <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> (1906–1915) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> (1908–1923) in his ideological development from Spring 1910 onward.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Of these two journals it is <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> that has attracted the attention of Gaudier-Brzeska's biographers: for instance, O'Keeffe, Evelyn Silber, and Roger Secrétain describe the anti-militarism espoused  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> by <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale's</span> founder Gustave Hervé (1871–1944) as the cornerstone for Gaudier's anarchist beliefs and for his refusal, in October 1912, to fulfill his military service, which was mandatory for all French males upon their 21st birthday.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In this essay, I will study Gaudier-Brzeska's French activist roots in greater detail to examine how various types of violence, culled from the spheres of politics, ideology, and popular culture, helped shape Gaudier's life and art from 1910 to his death in 1915. In so doing, I will show how Gaudier's political formation in France and England was filtered through his ongoing exposure to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. In contrast to O'Keeffe, who reduces Gaudier-Brzeska's ideological development to a series of fragmented episodes without internal coherence, or Secrétain, who attributes Gaudier-Brzeska's abrupt transition from French anarchist to French patriot to the pernicious influence, in 1913–14, of the English triumvirate T.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound, I would argue that the sculptor's ideological transformation in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> England was the legacy of his French radicalism.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> While the scholarship on the cultural 137 politics of the Vorticists Hulme, Lewis, and Pound is substantial, that on Gaudier-Brzeska remains scant aside from the writing of his biographers. Literary scholars have tended to consider only Gaudier's Vorticist phase, and even then he has been treated as a kind of passive muse for the politicized art criticism of his Vorticist colleagues.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> By considering the profound impact of French anarchism on Gaudier-Brzeska's art and activism, I hope to rectify this situation and to further enrich our understanding of Gaudier's unique role in the cultural politics of English modernism.</p>
<p>Gaudier's ongoing interest in anarchism led him to endorse aestheticized violence as a form of resistance to the punitive force of the State, whether in the guise of judicial sentencing, police repression, or compulsory service in the French military. In the artistic realm, Gaudier explored the medium of caricature as well as highly sexualized imagery as a visual counterpart to his oppositional politics, and self-styled status as a working-class bohemian who mocked the moral codes and values of the bourgeoisie. Though in support of radically different agendas, both the anarchists and the French State sought to justify acts of violence on moral and aesthetic grounds. As I will demonstrate, these conflicting discourses became mutually reinforcing once the anarchists and socialists deployed their views on morality and culture in support of the French war effort in August 1914. As we shall see, Gaudier-Brzeska's own anarchist politics were fully implicated in these events. To address such issues, we must begin by considering the complex interrelation of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> to <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, and the role of both journals to the broader socialist and anarchist movements in France.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Social War of Gustave Hervé and Victor Méric</h1>
<p>Gustave Hervé, who was profiled in one of the earliest issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> (February 1908), is widely recognized to have had a major impact on socialists and anarchists before 1914; indeed following the political formation of the French Socialist Party in 1905, Hervé became a political "star" wielding tremendous influence within the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière up to 1911.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> After 1905, Hervé headed a left-wing faction of the Party known as the "Hervéists" who were dedicated to anti-militarism and endorsed the anarchist notion of revolutionary opposition to the plutocratic State through mass insurrection. Concurrently, Hervé published his antimilitarist manifesto, <span style="font-style:italic;">Leur patrie</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Their Country</span>) , which declared patriotism and socialism to be incompatible. Hervé argued that the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span> in France had been exploited to serve the interests of the privileged classes, that all nations in Europe shared the same fate, and that the working class throughout Europe should respond to declarations of war with a refusal to take up arms in support of the government's version of <span style="font-style:italic;">la patrie</span>. Instead workers were to foment an armed insurrection and general strike to bring down the government and destroy the power of the bourgeoisie.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Hervé argued that the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span> was a key myth in the arsenal of the ruling classes, an illusion promoted by the plutocratic State through education, the Church, the theater, literature, and the press. It was through a "poisoning that begins in the cradle  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that [the bourgeoisie] succeeds in impressing upon those poor wretches who possess nothing, and for whom the 'country' is a step-mother, that they should go die for her joyously."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> If war were declared, the French left would first sabotage the mobilization of reservists, then call for the desertion of socialists and anarchist sympathizers within the military rank and file, and simultaneously organize a working class insurrection while the army—now in mutinous disarray—was occupied at the front. Hervé found allies for his program among the anarchists and members of anarcho-syndicalist unions who shared his belief that the military was the tool of moneyed interests. The anarchists, like Hervé, also held that a general strike in the midst of national crisis could topple the government.</p>
<p>Moreover the Hervéist and anarchist claim that the French army was the tool of wealthy industrialists had some basis in fact. Throughout the prewar period, the French government had used the army to suppress strike activity: notorious instances included the killing of five demonstrators in Narbonne by the 139<sup>th</sup> Infantry in June 1907, and the massacre of workers by the army at Draveil and Villeneuve-Saint-George in 1908<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup>. Such actions were critiqued by radical artists within the anti-militarist movement. The prominent anarchist cartoonist Jules Félix Grandjouan (1875–1968)—who contributed art and art criticism to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>—commemorated the Narbonne massacre in an inflammatory drawing for the official journal of the anarcho-syndicalist movement, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Voix du peuple</span> (1900–1939) [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Published in October 1907 under the title "Return of the Narbonne Soldier to his Parents," the illustration showed a mother spitting on her soldier-son who had just returned from suppressing a strike. While the father looks on in horror, Grandjouan supplements the mother's gesture with the memorable declamation "Oh! Jackass! You fired on the People!" In this manner, the real mother of the proletariat exhibited her wrath towards a son who had betrayed her by marching to the tune of Hervé's unnatural "step mother," <span style="font-style:italic;">la patrie</span>.</p>
<p>To promote their own anti-militarist program the anarchists complemented Hervé's campaign by founding the French wing of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Association Internationale Antimilitariste</span>.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The prominent anarchists Miguel Almereyda (Eugène Vigo) (1883–1917) and Georges Yvetot (1861–1943) headed the French section of delegates to the AIA's first Congress, held in Amsterdam on June 26–28, 1904. Yet another committed member was the self-declared anarchist Victor "Flax" Méric (1876–1933), who published an infamous AIA pamphlet titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à un conscrit</span> in November 1906, to coincide with the annual Autumn departure of conscripts to their military barracks.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Modeled after Yvetot's earlier <span style="font-style:italic;">Nouveau manuel du soldat</span> , Méric's brochure instructed conscripts to "choose your victims" if called upon to fire on striking workers; this veiled invitation to execute their own officers proved too much for the government which promptly indicted Méric and moved to suppress the AIA.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Most importantly it was Almereyda, Méric, and their anarcho-syndicalist and anti-militarist comrade Eugène Merle who collaborated with Hervé in founding <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> in December 1906. When Méric in turn founded <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> in 1908, the initial collaboration between Aristide Delannoy as cartoonist for the cover and Méric as author of the text, profiling each "man of the day," soon expanded to include contributions by Almereyda <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">(3 October 1908) and a regular section devoted to the avant-garde Salon d'automne and Salon des Indépendants (beginning 17 October 1908). As of 13 February 1909, the leftist art critic Maurice Robin joined the group, soon to be followed by another critic, Henri Guilbeaux, who took up the role of in-house art critic in January 1911. Robin and Guilbeaux were enthusiastic supporters of the Neo-Impressionists, in part due to their admiration for the anarcho-communist beliefs of the Neo-Impressionist <span style="font-style:italic;">chef</span>, Paul Signac, and his literary ally Jean Grave. The list of contributors expanded after 1911 to include res sympathetic to the Fauvists and Cubists, notably the socialist politician and art collector Marcel Sembat, the anarchist art historian and critic Élie Faure, and Pierre Dumont, an artist closely affiliated with the salon Cubists. Thus Gaudier-Brzeska was perceptive in October 1910 when he characterized <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">du jour</span> as the cultural counterpart to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, for the two journals were closely connected.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Liabeuf Affair</h1>
<p>Secrétain and O'Keeffe rightly point to Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's participation in a July 1, 1910 demonstration against the imminent execution in Paris of the worker "Liabeuf" as the first evidence of the artist's reaction to the leftist activism propagated in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> In analyzing Gaudier-Brzeska's response to the event, O'Keeffe relies on the memoir of the sculptor's friend and fellow artist Horace Brodzky detailing Gaudier-Brzeska's involvement in the demonstration, which ended in a police assault on the protestors. While Secrétain merely cites Gaudier-Brzeska's participation as evidence of his anarchist convictions, O'Keeffe draws different conclusions, suggesting on the basis of Brodzky's recollections that the artist's presence should not be confused with a steadfast allegiance to Hervé's political program. However, to properly ascertain Gaudier-Brzeska's motives, we need to delve deeper into the causes behind Liabeuf's arrest and the politicization of Liabeuf's incarceration by Hervé and Méric.</p>
<p>The shoemaker Jean Jacques Liabeuf was sentenced to death by guillotine for murdering a policeman and wounding six others on January 8, 1910.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Liabeuf, whose notoriety even drew the attention of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, had apparently armed himself with a revolver, a cobbler's knife, and wrists encased in leather guards with nails in preparation for his assault on the "flics."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The word "Apache," which was applied to Liabeuf by the French and foreign Press, was a derisive term commonly used to describe outlaws from the underclass who committed random acts of violence. In the French imagination, these street toughs were as uncontrollable, licentious, and primitive as their mythic namesakes, the Apache Indians indigenous to the American south west.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Thus the article documenting Liabeuf's exploits in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> chronicled French concerns over the morally corrupt condition of "Apache" youths who had formed street gangs and developed their own criminal subculture.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> countered such stereotypes by questioning the morality of the police and casting Liabeuf as the victim of police repression. Following his arrest, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> recounted the events leading up to the July 1 State execution in a manner meant to elicit their reader's sympathy for Liabeuf. In a January 10, 1910 <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> article titled "L'Exemple de l'Apache," Hervé described Liabeuf's actions as an act of revenge for an earlier charge. On August 14, 1909—four months before assaulting the police—Liabeuf had been sentenced to three months on charges of being a pimp. Hervé in turn argued that Liabeuf's only "crime" had been to fall in love with a prostitute, and that it was the police, whom he would later term the "Apaches of morality," who had wrongly labeled the relationship an economic arrangement. According to Hervé, Liabeuf thought the charge had sullied his honor as well as that of his girlfriend: he therefore sought revenge by attacking the policemen who had originally arrested him. Hervé described Liabeuf's actions as possessing "a certain beauty, a certain grandeur"; he also asserted that "Apaches"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> such as Liabeuf were driven to violence as a result of the social and economic injustice inflicted on them.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The government responded quickly, accusing Hervé of inciting murder and vindicating a criminal act. On March 7, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> announced that Hervé had been sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 1000 francs (the sentence was later reduced to two years).<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> On January 23, 1910, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> published Victor Méric's robust defense of Liabeuf and Hervé titled "The History of Apaches." Méric noted Hervé's self-professed admiration for the "energy and audacity" of so-called Apaches like Liabeuf, and he endorsed Hervé's further claim that the police were only Apaches of another type, whose sole purpose was to protect "the inviolability of private property." The police were aided in their mission by "the apaches of the army, of the magistrature," and ultimately, "of the government and of finance." Liabeuf and Hervé therefore were the victims of a plutocratic State, and their respective actions now took on symbolic significance as heroic signs of resistance. Over the period leading up to Liabeuf's execution, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> launched a campaign against "the Apaches" of the legal system by publishing Liabeuf's written justification for his actions and highlighting the judicial and punitive persecution of prostitutes throughout French history.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> The campaign culminated in the June 30 special issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> headlined "Pardon for Liabeuf! You cannot Guillotine him!" The journal combined a call for a mass demonstration in front of the prison where Liabeuf was to be executed with an article attesting to Liabeuf's "beautiful bearing" in the face of his impending execution.</p>
<p>Taken together, these articles point to the mythic transformation, under the auspices of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, of Liabeuf's crime into an anarchist act of "propaganda by the deed." Historians have noted that anarchists before 1914 frequently aestheticized acts of violence committed by ardent revolutionaries: for example when the self-declared anarchist Auguste Vaillant tossed a nail bomb into the Chamber of Deputies on December 9, 1893, fellow anarchist Laurent Tailhade famously declaimed: "What do the victims matter if the gesture is beautiful?"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> took up this anarchist rhetoric by aestheticizing Liabeuf's act of violence and declaring it an appropriate response to the false morality of a State that condoned social and economic inequality. Another agenda embedded in Hervé's interpretation of Liabeuf's motives concerned the issue of policing of sexual mores and the persecution of prostitutes. <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> adamantly condemned the capitalist exploitation of prostitutes while calling for universal sex education and the widespread use of contraception as a means of separating consensual sex from procreation.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Thus <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> melded themes of sexual liberation, State repression, and anarchist rebellion into a compact narrative concerning Liabeuf's unfolding plight.</p>
<p>This argument was developed further following Liabeuf's execution. The July 3 front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, devoted solely to Liabeuf, contained a drawing of the "victime des apaches des moeurs" along with his final declaration, "I am not a pimp!" [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. It also included an article describing the public demonstration against the execution the previous evening. Hervé's journal noted that 20,000 copies of the special  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> were distributed free of charge by "young and valiant comrades of the Socialist youth and revolutionaries of Paris… in all the working-class quarters."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Thus Gaudier-Brzeska may well have received news of the call to demonstrate publically against Liabeuf's impending execution from one of these ardent revolutionaries. Gaudier-Brzeska was not the only aspiring artist to heed the call: the writer André Salmon—a close friend of Picasso—joined the protest along with the art critic Léon Werth, writer Paul Adam, and Salmon's friend, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> editor Miguel Almereyda.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such links point to the broader impact of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> among the literary and artistic avant-garde. The anarchist Charles Malato, writing in the July 9 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, praised the proletarians, artists, and writers who had gathered that evening to defend the "hero" Liabeuf, noting that this poor worker had received a death sentence for the noble act of "avenging his honor."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> As a participant, Gaudier-Brzeska would have relished such descriptions, which cast his own decision to join the protest in epic proportions as part of an ongoing t for the revolutionary cause.</p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>It is with such thoughts in mind that we can now turn to O'Keeffe's interpretation of the episode. Although he notes that Gaudier-Brzeska probably first heard of Liabeuf's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> arrest by reading Hervé's January 10 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, he does not follow the journal's unfolding treatment of the Affair, but instead refers to a description of the June 30 demonstration culled from the mainstream British media, the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report cited by O'Keeffe described "an immense crowd of roughs" gathering in the vicinity of the prison and the ensuing confrontation between the police, the "Republican Guards" and "the jeunesse révolutionnaire who had mustered in full force." O'Keeffe then turns to Horace Brodzky's reminiscences of Gaudier-Brzeska's retelling of the event, proclaiming it to be reliable by virtue of its compatibility with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> But how reliable is Brodzky's account? Brodzky's version robs Gaudier-Bzreska of all agency, as if to imply that he stumbled into the event rather than purposely attending it out of strong and principled conviction. According to Brodzky, the artist was "carried away" by the crowd's enthusiasm; he "found himself drawn into trouble and swallowed up in the crowd." The protesters are labeled "the mob" and Gaudier-Brzeska thought the whole event "great fun," rather than an activist outcry against the brutal execution of a political victim.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Given Gaudier-Brzeska's adamant identification with anarchism, anti-militarism, and the cause of proletarian revolution, it could be argued that Brodzky's account deliberately drains the politics from his friend's actions. This is all the more likely in as much as Brodzky, who first met Gaudier-Brzeska in December 1912, seems to have assumed that, because his friend did not discuss politics with him, he was uninterested in politics altogether. "Brzeska did not concern himself with politics," Brodzky asserted, before adding the following qualifier, "or at least I never heard him discuss them."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Most importantly, O'Keeffe does not consider <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale's</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour's</span> sympathetic analyses of Liabeuf. Although the latter versions were decidedly partisan, the fact that Gaudier-Brzeska's own involvement stemmed directly from <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>'s call to arms suggests that Hervé and Méric's politicized interpretation of Liabeuf's actions give us better insight into Gaudier-Brzeska's motivations at the time. <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> had celebrated Liabeuf's status as a martyr to a noble and beautiful cause that ran counter to the corrupt moral standards and rampant injustice of the State. For an aspiring artist and revolutionary like Gaudier-Brzeska, this conflation of art and leftist politics with the heroic violence of an Apache—who defied public morality by loving a prostitute—must have been compelling.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Gaudier-Brzeska as an Apache</h1>
<p>Indeed Gaudier-Brzeska's public persona following his move to London in January 1911 may owe something to Hervé and Méric's aestheticized veneration of Liabeuf. As Lisa Tickner has demonstrated, the term "Apache" and its related associations, both sexual and anarchist, had already migrated to London well before Gaudier's arrival in January 1911.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The mythic image of the Apache had a profound impact on the future Vorticist Wyndham Lewis, who first befriended Gaudier-Brzeska sometime in the Fall of 1913. In his painting <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lovers</span> of 1912 [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>], Lewis captured the aggressive sexuality associated with the French hooligan by modeling his depiction of two working-class <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

He was probably familiar with descriptions of the Apache way of life by fellow bohemians like the leftist Aristide Bruant, whose fin-de-siècle cabaret songs detailed the unruly activities of the youthful Apaches who inhabited lower class dance halls and cafés.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In June 1914, Lewis praised Paris in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> for introducing "the Ballads of its Prehistoric Apache," a "rebellious adolescent," to the European public, thus underscoring the cultural and generational dimension of the Apache myth.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Lewis's Vorticist manifesto not only alludes to the French Apache's supposed love of music, but to the translation of this form of entertainment into the so-called "Apache dance," then wildly popular in up-scale night clubs in Paris and London.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Thus Lewis's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lovers</span> was one among a series of works that culminated in his lost canvas <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span> , which focused on the Apache-related theme of eroticism and violence on the dance floor. <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span>—the title of which alludes to carnivalesque depictions of the Flemish peasantry painted by Pieter Breugel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens—was originally designed for inclusion in the avant-garde London Cabaret known as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cave of the Golden Calf</span>.

<p class="continued">was first taken to the Club in June 1912 by a founding member and patron Haldane MacFall; Sophie Brzeska later described the establishment as a favorite haunt among members of England's wealthy "plutocracy."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The very title of this <span style="font-style:italic;">chic</span> cabaret conjures with the Old Testament story of licentious idol-worship among the Israelites, thereby suggesting that drunken revelry and sexual abandon awaited any costumer who dared to enter the establishment.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Lewis sketch for <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]—dominated by hard-edge angles and metallic blues and greys—served to reinforce the theme by portraying the dancing res at the center of the painting as under impending threat by a re lunching violently forward from the bottom right. The painting also alluded to a key component of the Apache persona, for French newspapers frequently reported that dance halls in Montmartre and Montparnasse had become the arena for violent battles between Apache youths for the attention of their female counterparts.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In contrast  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to Gaudier, whose exposure to the Apache was mediated through the anarchist press, Lewis' interest in working-class youth culture was filtered through the craze, among self-styled bohemians, for a commercialized version of the Apache legend. Whereas Hervé and Méric assimilated an aestheticized image of the anarchist Apache into their radical politics, the Apache dance and its literary offshoots arguably domesticated this symbol of working class revolt by catering to middle class youths such as Lewis, who were eager to test the limits of bourgeois propriety.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> All this would have been self-evident to Gaudier when he first saw Lewis's work at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cave of the Golden Calf</span> in 1912 and later joined Lewis in founding the artists' collective known as the Rebel Art Center in March 1914.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1913, Gaudier-Brzeska was an established member of London's artistic bohemia, but he frequently took its anti-establishment tenets of sexual freedom and hostility to bourgeois morality to extremes worthy of an Hervéist or anarchist "Apache." Before coming to London, Gaudier had been practicing his own version of sexual liberation with Sophie Brzeska, whom he described in 1910 as "an anarchist—simply and naturally" by virtue of her independent character.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> In an October 9, 1913 letter to his lover Sophie, Gaudier-Brzeska casually informed her of his visit, with fellow artist Alfred Wolmark, "to a café à putains," a café full of prostitutes, while Ede and O'Keeffe recount numerous reports of the sculptor's eager participation in brawls with local street toughs.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In her memoirs, Sophie Brzeska recorded a visit with Ezra Pound in the Fall of 1913 during which Gaudier told Pound of his scuffle with "une bande d'apaches anglais."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska also enjoyed eating and drinking in proletarian taverns and greasy spoons, wherein he actively identified with the coarse behavior of the male workers and street hooligans who frequented such establishments. Brodzky later recalled that his friend sought out run-down "cafes" on the Upper King's Road in Chelsea, noting that "he had no dislike of the cracked cups and positively enjoyed the obscene talk of truck-men, and the general roughness of the place."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Wolmark cemented Gaudier-Brzeska's reputation as an unruly bohemian when he exhibited a portrait of the artist at the third annual exhibition of the National Portrait Society at the Grosvenor Gallery in February 1914 [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>]. Wolmark signaled his friend's ideological allegiances by casting him as an anti-bourgeois rebel, dressed in red and black, the colors of the anarchist movement.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> His portrait placed the artist against a crimson background, with his bodily frame nearly reaching the top of this six-foot high canvas. Dressed in an imposing black hat, coal-black trousers, black boots, a body-length black cape, and a collarless, scarlet-red shirt, Gaudier-Brzeska is portrayed with a gesticulating left hand and open palm, while his gaunt face is painted in a garish combination of Fauve greens and reds. As O'Keeffe aptly puts it: "he looks like a stage anarchist rehearsing the throwing of a bomb."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's conflation of unbridled sexuality, violence, and an Apache attitude found a ready outlet through his friendship, beginning in July 1913, with the poet Ezra Pound, and, in 1914, with the self-styled philosopher T. E. Hulme. Pound actively promoted the sculptor's work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> (1914–19), a journal that supported birth control, the anarchist doctrine of free love, and advocated a version of anarcho-individualism <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">modeled on the ideas Max Stirner. Hulme in turn was an enthusiast of the French anarcho-syndicalist Georges Sorel, whose highly influential book <span style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Violence</span>  aestheticized proletarian violence in the form of the general strike.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In 1914, Hulme began promoting the work of Jacob Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska, and Lewis in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> and invited the Vorticists to participate in his weekly literary Salon, held every Tuesday at his home on Frith Street.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In addition Hulme, Lewis, and Pound celebrated an aggressive form of male virility as an expression of their anti-bourgeois values. Scholars have noted that Gaudier-Brzeska's phallic <span style="font-style:italic;">Head of Ezra Pound</span>  [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>] was one such manifestation of the merger of anarchism, primitivism, and themes of male virility among the London avant-garde.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> The sculptor Jacob Epstein recalled that "Pound instructed Gaudier to make the Head virile" while Lewis later described Gaudier's sculpted homage as "Ezra in the form of a marble phallus." Gaudier's artist friend Horace Brodzky complained that there was "too much sex talk" among the Vorticist group, adding that the Head's "purpose and beginning were entirely pornographic."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Other signifiers of Vorticist virility in Gaudier-Brzeska's arsenal were the series of "knuckle dusters" he cut from brass in 1914 for Lewis and T.E. Hulme.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The Apache associations of these implements were self-evident, for brass knuckles, along with the switch blade and hand gun were described in the press as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the weapons of choice among street gangs in London and Paris.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Hulme's lover, Kate Lechmere, described the iconography of one such Gaudier-Brzeska "duster," now in a private collection (see issue cover image): "The two pieces curving out sideways at the bottom are the woman's parted legs. The central hole is the vagina, and the four holes at the top are the woman's head tossing and turning as she achieves orgasm."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> Evidently Gaudier-Brzeska's commitment to the anarchist spirit of rebellion—exemplified by the "Apache" Liabeuf—was still in full force in 1914, albeit through the mediating lens of his new-found allies among the London avant-garde.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">The Artists of Les Hommes du jour: Jean-Louis Forain and Théophile Steinlen</h1>
<p>While Gaudier's encounter with Lewis and Pound gave new relevance to his anarchist conception of the Paris Apache, his art before the summer of 1913 attests to the impact of those activist artists championed by <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> on his evolving aesthetic. In his October 4, 1910 letter announcing his allegiance to anarchism, Gaudier-Brzeska singled out three artists for special praise: Théophile Steinlen, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, and above all, Jean-Louis Forain, a follower of Edgar Degas most famous for his satirical images of the licentious life-style of the French bourgeoisie.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Gaudier informed Dr. Uhlemayr <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">that, "as a rule, when I go to sleep I am glad to wake and see the day and to look at the lovely engraving by Steinlen or a poster by Toulouse-Lautrec which I have." Gaudier's drawings from the period make plain his debt to the anarchist-inflected subject matter favored by Steinlen. In a Paris sketchbook dated to 1910, Gaudier did a series of drawings of workers, cart horses, and industrial boats along the Seine, as well as a poignant image of a poverty stricken family, made homeless by the flooding of Paris in the winter of 1910 [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>]. This drawing of a downtrodden mother holding a baby while her husband bends under the weight of a sack containing all their worldly possessions brings to mind images of itinerant families—both peasant and proletarian—by committed anarchists such as Camille Pissarro and Steinlen.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> In sketch books completed before he settled in France in the Fall of 1909, Gaudier had focused on the Roman and Gothic edifices he encountered in Bristol, Bath, and Nuremburg, but in his Paris sketchbook—concurrent with his commitment to anarchism—images of the urban proletariat are given sudden prominence.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> In October of the same year, Gaudier praised the "perfect anarchy" inherent in Forain's drawings, thus making it clear that his views on drawing technique had ideological import (a subject he would return to in 1911). That assessment appears in a letter to Dr. Uhlemayr disparaging the philosopher Hippolyte Taine's positivist tract, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy of Art</span> : <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I have been reading Taine's <span style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy of Art</span>. His theory does not seem to me to be very sound. It is true that environment does have an influence, but what has a much greater effect on the artist is love or hatred. He uses his setting to express these things—that is how I see it. Take, for example, Forain—the best of draughtsmen, in my opinion. This man has been made spiteful by the misery of his early years; he began his work in a spirit of implacable raillery against the customs and manners of his contemporaries; today the influence of his surrounding has modified enormously—he is rich. The setting has changed but the artist has become more intransigent and malicious than before. His drawings breathe the strength of perfect anarchy. That this powerful personality dominates his surroundings is a thing Taine never explains.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gaudier-Brzeska's choice of artists is telling, for Lautrec, Forain, and Steinlen all had strong links to the fin-de-siècle anarchist milieu. Richard Sonn in his book on the anarchist movement during the 1890s has documented the support these three artists garnered in anarchist circles<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup>; what is significant for our purposes is their continued lionization in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. Retrospective exhibitions of Lautrec's work were repeatedly celebrated in the pages of the journal (see for instance, "Toulouse-Lautrec," 7 November 1908); Theophile Steinlen, himself a committed anarchist, designed the cover for a special edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> devoted to "War and the Warriors" (1 February 1911); while Forain—a close friend of Steinlen and a contributor to the anarchist journal <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assiette au buerre</span> (1901–1912)—was declared "man of the day" for the 26 February 1910 issue.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In the accompanying article—which Gaudier-Brzeska surely would have read—Maurice Robin charted Forain's rise from humble origins (his father was a sign painter) to a condition of wealth, all the while marveling at the artist's unrelenting criticism of the social decadence and political corruption stemming from the reign of the bourgeoisie. Robin noted that Forain's change in fortunes did little to stem the anti-parliamentary vitriol of his cartoons, nor had Forain lost the ideological fervor that led him to participate in the French commune.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> In fact, Gaudier-Brzeska's celebration of Forain's intransigence in his critique of Taine was a virtual <span style="font-style:italic;">repris</span>e of Maurice Robin's earlier assessment of the artist: it is no wonder that he attributed "the strength of perfect anarchy" to Forain's drawings.</p>
<p>As Evelyn Silber has demonstrated, Gaudier's rejection of Taine was also part and parcel of his embrace of philosopher Henri Bergson's notion of life as a durational flux, which in turn inspired his preoccupation with capturing movement, whether in the guise of bodies in motion in the streets of Paris and London, or through his evolving method of drawing. While attending life-drawing classes in London in the Fall of 1912, Gaudier was in the habit of working at a frenetic pace, literally creating hundreds of drawings in a single session and often capturing the models while resting between poses [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>]. Employing a stylographic pen, Gaudier reduced the bodily mass of the sitters to a thin line, frequently moving around the model to capture several viewpoints, exaggerating portions of their anatomy, and failing to circumscribe the body so as to suggest the potential for movement. His technique was clearly indebted to Rodin's pronouncements on modeling in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Art</span> , but it was also in keeping with the rapid, reportage technique he used in his sketch books to capture an anarchist perspective of the quotidian world around him.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Art and Censorship: The case of Aristide Delannoy</h1>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's anarchist self-fashioning is also closely related to his early interest in the drawing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour's</span> chief artist, Aristide Delannoy (1874–1911).<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> On May 19, 1911, Gaudier expressed his profound sadness to Sophie on reading in <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> of Delannoy's death at the early age of 37. For anarchist activists Delannoy was nothing short of a hero: sentenced to a year in the Santé prison in 1908 for publishing a caricature deemed to be a scornful invective against the army, Delannoy died prematurely as a direct result of the prison's sordid conditions. "I am very fond of his way of drawing," Gaudier-Brzeska wrote, before asking Sophie to "pray to the beautiful sun for Delannoy."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> On June 30, 1911 he returned to the subject of Delannoy, stating his intention to purchase a portrait print of the dead artist for 2 francs 50 as a token of his love for Sophie. The print was in fact based on a death-bed portrait of the artist by his friend Gaston Raieter, designed for the cover of the May 13, 1911 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>].<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> Such comments are a measure of Gaudier-Brzeska's spiritual and artistic identification with the re of Delannoy, which prompts me to consider the possible impact of Delannoy on Gaudier-Brzeska's art in Paris and during  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> his first years in London. Given Delannoy's exalted place in his artistic pantheon, the history of this anarchist's imprisonment is worth recounting.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup></p>

<p>In October 1908, Delannoy and Victor Méric were each sentenced to the extraordinary term of one year in prison and a fine of 3000 francs for their collaboration on a May 1908 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> profiling General Albert d'Amade, who had led the military's infamous suppression of a rebellion in French-occupied Morocco [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 11</a>]. Known as the "Chaouia Campaign," the army assault began in January 1908, when d'Amade initiated a scorched earth policy in the region around Casablanca. From January through to April 1908, the French press reported that troops bombed and sacked local villages, indiscriminately killing men, women and children.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Delannoy's caricature depicted d'Amade as a bloody butcher, dressed in his military regalia and gazing with pride at a burning village littered with the bodies of whole families. Méric's article in turn was a text-book example of Hervéist anti-militarism. Méric began by declaring the army the tool of high finance, noting that "noble" phrases like "for the Country [<span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>]" were routinely evoked by European governments to justify the pillaging of newly created colonies abroad, especially in North Africa. Méric then drew a distinction between life-long soldiers like d'Amade and the poor conscripts under his command. Whereas d'Amade and his ilk were "professional murderers" who "lived for war," the foot soldiers under his leadership were to be pitied. They, too, were victims of State oppression, for their humanity was degraded as a result of d'Amade's orders to attack the civilian population in Morocco. To underscore the gap between the myth of military  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> virtue and the grisly actualities in Morocco, Méric closed his article by reproducing a newspaper dispatch from <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Matin</span> documenting one such military assault, and then punctuating <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Matin</span>'s description of the "sea of blood" resulting from the French attack with the phrases "Brave French Soldiers!," "Valiant French Soldiers!," "Admirable French Soldiers!." This discourse was repeated in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, which regularly published anti-militarist diatribes against the Moroccan campaign from 1907 to 1911, during the height of the French military incursion.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Thus when the government moved to charge Delannoy and Méric it claimed that the caricature and the accompanying text were an "insult" to the military.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska endorsed Hervé and Méric's anti-militarist assessment of the Moroccan scandal, writing to Dr. Uhlemayr on January 3, 1913 that he had "deserted their [the French] Army" in part because the French military were "slaughterers of the Arabs."<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> The sculptor's reference to "their army" was a clear allusion to Hervé's famous condemnation of "their <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>;" thus signaling the ideological genealogy of his anti-militarism.</p>

<p>The government's claim that Delannoy and Méric had insulted the military was a carefully worded accusation.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> This legal terminology derived from the Press Law of July, 1881, which specified that defamation of institutions fulfilling a public function, including the army and navy, was a punishable offense. The law went on to define defamation as the overt imputation of a fact which injured the honor or esteem to the aggrieved institution, but specified that the truth of the imputed fact "discharged the complaint."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> As with the trail of Liabeuf, the authority to commit acts of violence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> was at issue, with the government proclaiming its right to defend the morality of its institutions against its critics. By claiming that the army was honorable, the State wished to signify that the violent actions of the military were governed by qualities of self-discipline and ethical responsibility that exempted it from criticism. Delannoy, whose case was publicized in the anarchist journal <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assiette au beurre</span>, challenged this legal argument by defending his drawing as an accurate representation of the French military's activities in Morocco. He rested his case by declaring that "I don't have two moralities and I approve no crime."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Thus Delannoy accused the French government of practicing a double standard. While the legal system proclaimed the army to be the guardian of French moral conduct, evidence showed that the government's military campaign in Morocco broke every ethical code imaginable. Far from behaving honorably on the field of battle, the French military had engaged in criminal activity by any legal standard. Thus in Delannoy's estimation, the Third Republic had contradicted its own laws by ignoring the truth and accusing him of defamation.</p>
<p>On October 3, 1908, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> published the outcome of the trial, as well as biographical profiles of the two "criminals"; this was followed by a short notice in the 6 March 1909 issue announcing that Delannoy's sentence had been reduced due to his ill health. The July 3, 1909 issue relayed the happy news that Delannoy had finally been released from prison, but spoke no further about his declining health.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Over 1909 and to the end of 1910, Delannoy's caricatures continued to grace the covers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>; but from December 30 on, his cover illustrations only appeared intermittently, under the signature "Interim Delannoy." Between January and March 1911, Delannoy published a series of inmate portraits, sketched during his internment [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>],<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> then on May 13, 1911, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> announced the startling news of Delannoy's demise. This issue, which Gaudier-Brzeska read,<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> included a moving biography of the artist's life by Victor Méric and a separate homage by art critic Henri Guilbeaux, who drew a metaphorical parallel between Delannoy's revolutionary ideals and the audacious spontaneity of his drawing style which he described as dynamic and "high-strung." Delannoy's most famous caricatures were also reprinted in the journal, including that of General d'Amade.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> After Delannoy's death <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> launched an appeal to artists to donate works of art for a raffle in support of Delannoy's destitute family: contributors included such luminaries as Charles Angrand, Maximilian Luce, Paul Signac, and most surprisingly, Henri Matisse.<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>We can gain some idea of Delannoy's impact on Gaudier-Brzeska by considering the role of drawing and caricature in his artistic development. In April 1910, Gaudier started his "Chaos" sketchbook, and quickly populated it with caricatures and a vast number of human heads, some in profile, others in three-quarter profile, sketched from life.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> He signaled his class allegiances by labeling a portrait of a male with a high forehead and an opulent beard and mustache "a bourgeois scoundrel," while another was simply titled "worker." Clearly Gaudier-Brzeska was compiling an inventory of social types, and his preoccupation with portraiture may have been in emulation of Delannoy's ongoing series of portrait busts commissioned for <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. In a letter written on the May 19, 1911, the sculptor emulated Guilbeaux's correlation between Delannoy's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> loose drawing style and his anarchist ideals by positing his own version of libertarian aesthetics. Gaudier-Brzeska claimed that artists seeking a hard-edged "purity of line" on the model of Neoclassicists like John Flaxman were "opposed to individual freedom" for "the outline is only a purely imaginary thing" whose sole purpose is to "contain the planes of the mass, receiving light and shade."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> This declaration brings to mind the flowing, tremulous lines in Delannoy's reportage caricature of the jail hairdresser and another of a resting prisoner, "Le Repos de Juste," [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>] reproduced in the March 17, 1911 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Indeed portraiture—and caricature—would continue to be a major theme in Gaudier-Brzeska's oeuvre throughout his short life. Gaudier arguably arrived at a sculptural equivalent to Delannoy's satirical images of the French military in his portrait bust of Raymond Smythies, a fifty-two year old retired Major whom Sophie Brzeska christened "Colonel Squeeze."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska met Symthies through his contact with Haldane MacFall, another retired officer and early patron whom Gaudier-Brzeska  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> derisively described as having "an atrocious mouth, a cow-like head… and a mustache à la Guillaume d'Allemagne."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> As an anti-militarist Gaudier was clearly uncomfortable with these prospective clients. While Smythies sat for his portrait in the winter of 1912, the sculptor repeatedly provoked the Major through his coarse behavior. During the sittings, Gaudier apparently hollowed out a cavity in the cranium of the clay bust into which he repeatedly deposited copious amounts of spit: the Major was reportedly "horrified and disgusted."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> As O'Keeffe notes, the sculpted bust—finished in March 1912—cast Symthies as a pompous military man [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>]: "The sitter's pugnacious military bearing was conveyed by the moustache-caked upper lip and the slight upward tilting of the heavy jowls and chin, elevating the tip of the nose to the point almost level with the eyes."<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> Smythies physiognomy recalls that of Delannoy's equally unflattering caricatures of his jailers, with their exaggerated mustaches, pig-like noses, and bloated facial features [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 14</a>].</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gaudier-Brzeska's anti-militarism</h1>
<p>As Gaudier-Brzeska's October 1912 enlistment date approached, he repeatedly reiterated his opposition to the military in language that emulated the belligerent tone of Hervé and his colleagues. He also alluded to military scandals highlighted by <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>. For instance on June 18, 1912 the sculptor informed Dr. Uhlemayr that, if conscripted, he would "never bend" his will "to the commands of an officer," with the result that "they would probably send me to a disciplining company in Morocco," where he would die.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska's gloomy description was undoubtedly a response to the series of articles published in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> over 1911–12, detailing the military's attempt to cover up the inhumane treatment—frequently resulting in death—of unruly leftist conscripts who were sent to such prison battalions in Africa, known in French argot as "Biribi."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> On October 11, 1912, he informed Sophie that he had officially defaulted on his military service as of three o'clock that afternoon, concluding, "[M]ay the good sun burst all the officers of this filthy regiment!"<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> Less than a week later the sculptor outlined his Hervéist rebuttal of letters sent by his family and the Mayor of his native village of St-Jean-de-Braye, imploring him to reconsider his decision.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Writing on October 16, 1912, he declared his sadness that "the youth of France had not revolted en masse against the abominable conscription," that he couldn't help inveighing to his mother about "all the prejudices with which the rich stuff the poor in order to keep them in slavery," and that he did not "recognize any patriotic duty" to fulfill his military service.<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Anti-patriotism was very much on Gaudier-Brzeska's mind in his caustic reply to the town Mayor, Monsieur Galloueder, who implored him not to follow the example of the famous playwright Henri Bernstein. Bernstein, the mayor reported, had shirked his military service only to make a humiliating public apology when news of his "cowardice" emerged in the press.<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska was well aware of Bernstein, having read Victor Méric's withering response to the playwright's public apology in the March 4, 1911 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. The sculptor's icy reply assured the Mayor that he would not behave like Bernstein but instead acquire British citizenship before heading to Germany in order to subject the Mayor to "the pitiable spectacle of seeing a French artist erecting a monument to commemorate a French defeat." Gustave Hervé had first scandalized the French public by publishing an article in 1901 calling on French regiments to commemorate Napoleon's victory over the Austrians at Wagram by planting their regimental flags in a pile of horse manure, and Gaudier-Brzeska clearly hoped to emulate the outlandishness of Hervé's anti-militarist declaration.<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup> By informing the Mayor of his intent to sculpt a monument celebrating an anticipated French defeat at the hands of the Germans, Gaudier-Brzeska threatened to further shame the village and its inhabitants by using his skills as an artist to create a public scandal.</p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska conveyed his anti-militarist convictions to his political confidant Dr. Uhlemayr in letters dated January 6 and March 12, 1913, but due to the loss of much of his correspondence, we do not know how his ideas evolved after that date.<sup><a name="f90-text" href="#f90">90</a></sup> This silence is all the more startling given Gaudier-Brzeska's eagerness to enlist following the outbreak of World War One in early August 1914. While scholars have rightly pointed to the impact of res like Hulme on the sculptor's thinking as the threat of war intensified,<sup><a name="f91-text" href="#f91">91</a></sup> no one has addressed the relation of Gaudier-Brzeska's rejection of anti-militarism to the Hervéist movement that served to define his anarchist convictions. In fact the French sculptor was not alone in refuting anti-militarism, for Hervé had undergone a similar transformation following his release from prison in July 1912.</p>
<p>Beginning in Autumn 1912, Hervé now argued that anarchists and socialists should reform the army from within rather than destroy it <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>. He called for the French army to return to its Jacobin roots, claiming that the same patriotic and revolutionary spirit that animated the Republican Guards during the Commune could serve as the guiding light for the French army in his own day.<sup><a name="f92-text" href="#f92">92</a></sup> In a <span style="font-style:italic;">Guerre sociale</span> article titled "14 July 1913," published the following year, Hervé proclaimed his patriotic allegiance to Republicanism as a counterweight to the conservative nationalism of the French Right.<sup><a name="f93-text" href="#f93">93</a></sup> Such pronouncements proved too much for his leftist colleagues Almereyda and Merle, who denounced Hervéism, and founded the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonnet Rouge</span> in November 1913 to promote anarchist anti-militarism.<sup><a name="f94-text" href="#f94">94</a></sup> By 1914, Hervé had not only rejected the idea of an insurrection in the case of war, he had given up on revolutionary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> anti-militarism: thus on August 2, 1914, the first day of French mobilization, Hervé publically declared his own desire to enlist on <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>'s front page, concluding with the strident declaration "Long Live France!"<sup><a name="f95-text" href="#f95">95</a></sup> In Hervé's view, France was the guardian of republican values, Germany by contrast was a bastion of Prussian militarism. Thus the defense of France amounted to a defense of the revolutionary tradition and European civilization as such. Over the previous months, French anarchists and socialists had tried desperately to reach an international consensus on how to react to the declaration of war. When their efforts ended in failure, most of the French Left took up Hervé's position. Thus Almereyda's <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonnet Rouge</span> ran the headline "To Arms, Citizens!" on August 3, 1914, while the anarcho-syndicalist <span style="font-style:italic;">La Bataille syndicaliste</span> proclaimed that it was necessary "to save the democratic and revolutionary tradition of France" against "the right of the fist, against German militarism."<sup><a name="f96-text" href="#f96">96</a></sup> Even the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom Gaudier-Brzeska idolized, took up the patriotic line, along with prominent French anarchists like Jean Grave and Charles Malato.<sup><a name="f97-text" href="#f97">97</a></sup> Since Kropotkin resided in London, his pro-war declaration was widely publicized in the British press. A similar fate befell <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, which—following Méric's forced conscription under police escort<sup><a name="f98-text" href="#f98">98</a></sup>—quickly endorsed Hervé's position. Having sanctioned the Third Republic's war against Germany as a defense of the republican and socialist tradition, the French Left then added culture to the equation, thereby drawing a clear cut correlation between violence and aesthetics that departed dramatically from their previous commitment to anti-militarism.</p>
<p>Over the Fall of 1914, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> joined prominent socialist and anarchist journals in decrying the German bombardment of Reims Cathedral in September 1914.<sup><a name="f99-text" href="#f99">99</a></sup> Even Romain Rolland, France's most prominent wartime pacifist, mourned the Cathedral's destruction, writing in 1915 while in exile in Switzerland that Reims represented "[the life] of a people whose centuries vibrate like a symphony in this organ of stone".<sup><a name="f100-text" href="#f100">100</a></sup> Historians have noted the frequent comparison made by key res on the French left between the medieval guilds who built the cathedrals and contemporary labor unions.<sup><a name="f101-text" href="#f101">101</a></sup> Before the war, French syndicalists claimed that cathedrals such as Reims were the cultural birthright of the French proletariat, and in the Fall of 1914, these same leftists pointed to the destruction of Reims as evidence of the Kaiser's barbaric hostility towards the people of France, whose Republican values were now in peril. <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> reinforced this message in the October 1914 edition by pairing images of the Cathedral's destruction with the bitter caption, "How the Boches [Germans] apply civilization in the name of German culture."</p>
<p>Such leftist associations also pertain to this wartime postcard of Reims after the German bombardment [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 15</a>], which highlighted the survival of a sculpted Gallic cock in the lower right of the cathedral as evidence of the fortitude and ultimate triumph of France in the face of the German onslaught. The import of the rooster was made explicit by the inclusion of a caption, published in French and English: "A Symbol—Over the fired streets, the French cock is always standing." Before the war, French anarchists had made symbolic use of the rooster as a herald announcing the anarchist new dawn, and as a symbol of revolution, since roosters will t to the death.<sup><a name="f102-text" href="#f102">102</a></sup> Thus  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in addition to being a generic emblem of the people of France, the humble rooster signified the anarchist battle against capitalism. This sculpted rooster, perched on this medieval cathedral, would have been a powerful symbol of the French left's new-found patriotism.<sup><a name="f103-text" href="#f103">103</a></sup> Such associations undoubtedly resonated for any anarchist serving on the front lines: thus it is all the more telling that Gaudier-Brzeska mailed this patriotic postcard to Ezra Pound from the trenches in December 1914.<sup><a name="f104-text" href="#f104">104</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Aestheticized Violence from Left to Right</h1>
<p>In reflecting on Gaudier-Brzeska's trajectory from anarchist anti-militarist to French patriot, what is most striking is the role of violence and morality in shaping his development as an artist and self-styled revolutionary. As we have seen, in Europe before World War One, concepts of class, nationhood, ethics, and aesthetics, were utilized to define acceptable and unacceptable forms of violence. With regard to class, the contested image of the Apache acted as a lightning rod. For the bourgeoisie, the government, and the mainstream press, the Parisian Apache was an immoral criminal who committed random acts of violence. Thus the term "Apache" signified a kind of primitive barbarism that identified res like Liabeuf not only as a threat to the rule of law, but to civilization itself. In response the anarchists argued that such acts were not indiscriminate, but instead ethically motivated. Hervé and Méric claimed that Liabeuf had chosen to defend the dignity of his lover and their relationship, which had been sullied by the police. In this logic, the Apache ironically followed a code similar to that of the French upper classes, whose duels and other ritualized forms of violence were enacted when issues of honor were at stake.<sup><a name="f105-text" href="#f105">105</a></sup> Such thinking accounts for writer Anatole France's surprising claim that the Apaches represented "the last remnant of the days of chivalry, they being the only men left given to indulge in duels to the death for a fair one's lover."<sup><a name="f106-text" href="#f106">106</a></sup> While Hervé and Méric would have never compared Liabeuf to a Medieval aristocrat, they did use metaphorical language that reiterated bourgeois codes for honorable conflict: thus Liabeuf's battle on behalf of his lover is described as possessing "a certain grandeur," and he faced his impending execution with a "beautiful bearing." Such passions were further domesticated by means of the commercialized Apache dance, which proved so alluring to the French and English bourgeoisie. Gaudier and his Vorticist friends arguably conjured with the ambivalent status of the Apache in the public imagination, though the anarchist Gaudier differed tellingly from Wyndham Lewis in endorsing Apache street violence rather than bourgeois fantasies about Apache seduction on the dance floor.</p>
<p>Where the anarchists departed from writers like Anatole France was in claiming that such aestheticized violence should be extended to include forms of retribution against the police and society in general. When the anarchist Laurent Tailhade responded to the bombing of the Chamber of Deputies with the pronouncement, "What do the victims matter if the gesture is beautiful?," he asserted the anarchist right to commit <span style="font-style:italic;">depersonalized</span> acts of violence,<sup><a name="f107-text" href="#f107">107</a></sup> whose moral justification resided in the injustice inflicted by plutocratic capitalism on its working-class victims. The State responded to such violence by executing the perpetrators, whom the anarchists promptly labeled martyrs to the cause.<sup><a name="f108-text" href="#f108">108</a></sup></p>
<p>The battle over who was justified in committing acts of symbolic violence was extended to encompass art when the anarchists set out to challenge the French government's punitive censorship laws. By claiming that its military institutions were honorable and therefore not subject to defamation, the government opened itself up to the kind of satirical critique developed by artists like Delannoy in his portrait of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> General d'Amade, or by Hervé in his call for soldiers to plant their regimental flags in horse manure. Gaudier-Brzeska sided with Hervé, and his decision to refuse his military service was a direct response to the military's Moroccan campaign as well as the government's persecution of Delannoy. Gaudier's portrait bust of Major Smythies and his projected monument commemorating a French military defeat, arguably represent his own attempt to dishonor the military as well as the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>.</p>
<p>In August 1914, these discursive terms underwent radical revision as the French left merged its justification for violence with the moral codes deployed by the French government in its war against Germany. Whereas these anarchists had previously pitted their aesthetic violence against the barbarism of the French State, they now transformed the politics of class war into a cultural narrative concerning war between nations. The Germans were now cast as cruel and despotic, while the acts of violence undertaken by the French military took on the moral rectitude and heroism previously reserved for res like the Apache Liabeuf. To signal their moral superiority over their German adversaries, anarchists along with main stream Republicans seized on the bombardment of Reims Cathedral as evidence of the aesthetic dimension of their struggle to defend culture as such. In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Violence</span>, the anarcho-syndicalist Georges Sorel had claimed that proletarian violence ultimately served the "time honored interests of civilization"<sup><a name="f109-text" href="#f109">109</a></sup>; after war broke out in August 1914, the left extended this civilizing mission to include total war against Germany. Shortly after his decision to enlist, Sophie Brzeska recalled that Gaudier too justified his new-found patriotism by melding the defense of France with that of European culture: "This is no longer a political war," Gaudier declared, "It is a matter of saving civilization before these bastards destroy all works of Art."<sup><a name="f110-text" href="#f110">110</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's decision to enlist, therefore, did not necessarily signal his rejection of anarchism and Hervéism, but quite possibly was just one example of the painful choices made by adherents of anti-militarism over whether to support the republican tradition. No French citizen on the Left in August 1914 could have foreseen that the revolutionary values justifying this so-called <span style="font-style:italic;">union sacrée</span> would dissipate under the impact of the war itself. Thus Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, like so many others, rallied to the call of "<span style="font-style:italic;">leur patrie</span>," to find tragically that Hervé's earlier assessment of that mobilizing myth was closer to the truth.</p>

On anarcho-individualism and Vorticism see for instance, Bruce Clarke, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dora Marsden and Early Modernism: Gender, Individualism, Science</span> (Ann Arbor, MI:University of Michigan Press, 1996); David Kadlec, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mosaic Modernism: Anarchism, Pragmatism, Culture</span> (London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000); Paul Peppis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature, Politics, and the English Avant-Garde: Nation and Empire, 1901–1918</span> (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2000); and Robert von Hallberg, "Libertarian Imagism," <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 2, no. 2 (April 1995): 63–79.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f40" href="#f40-text">40. </a>In reviewing literary representations of the Apache, Haine concludes that "rather than overthrow middle-class society, the Apaches, through their bohemian interpreters, helped expand the definition of middle-class society by inspiring new styles of dress, speech, and dance. The Apaches show that working-class violence or deviance could be a subject not simply of condemnation but also of commercialization." Haine, 463. Haine's thesis, which follows that of Jerrold Seigel, does not take account of the politically informed defense of the Apache operative in anarchist circles in Paris; moreover I would argue that Gaudier's embrace of an Apache persona was as much a legacy of his anarchism as exposure to the bohemian world of Lewis's London.

This ideological declaration—made to his lover Sophie Brzeska and to his immediate family—stands in stark contrast to the explanation apparently given to his patron, the retired military officer Haldane MacFall. In a letter to Horace Brodzky dated October 2, 1919, MacFall recalled that Gaudier "came to me one day saying that he was ignoring his calling up papers for the French army" because "he could not face two years lost to sculpture." "Well I went into it very seriously with him—told him it was a hideous thing for a French artist to cut himself off from France, above all from Paris… However he decided to desert. But the moment the war broke out… it found him too much a Frenchman to forsake his people." MacFall's statement not only attests to his lack of awareness of Gaudier's anarchist convictions, but likely indicates the careful manner in which Gaudier justified his actions for a patron he deemed hostile to his political beliefs. Gaudier evidently thought the noble calling of art, rather than anarchist anti-militarism, suitable justification for his refusal in enlist in the eyes of MacFall.

While working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Savage Messiah</span>, Ede was able to draw on the Uhlemayr correspondence, but scholars have been unable to trace these documents and they are no longer on deposit at the Gaudier-Brzeska archives in Kettles Yard Gallery, University of Cambridge, or University of Essex, all of which hold Ede's papers. Roger Cole is apparently the last scholar to have made use of the original letters. His biography of Gaudier-Brzeska informs us that Uhlemayr had sent Ede a group of letters and cards from Gaudier, including drawings, which he asked to be returned to him. Cole however does not indicate how he gained access to this material or its present location.

On the back Gaudier writes to thank Pound for sending him a sweater and a pack of cigarettes; he also notes that "we killed a German a few days ago." Paul O'Keeffe conjectures that Gaudier may have sent the postcard to Pound because the English caption concerning the French cock "must have been liable to vulgar innuendo" (O'Keeffe, 272); however given the ideological import of the Gallic rooster at this historical juncture that interpretation seems reductive and lacking in nuance. Gaudier sent another wartime postcard of the Cathedral, which pictured Reims before its destruction, to Katie Smith on May 29, 1915. On this postcard he noted that he was writing while "covered with earth" in the midst of an intense German bombardment. This postcard is included in the Gaudier Brzeska-Katie Smith correspondence at the Hyman Kreitman Research Center, housed at Tate Gallery Archive.

<div class="attrib">—Willem de Kooning, 1959<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to critic David Sylvester in 1960, Willem de Kooning described his canvases of the late 1950s, what I will call his "highway paintings," in the following way:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Most of them are landscapes and highways and sensations of that, outside the city—with the feeling of going to the city or coming from it … But I love to go out in a car. I'm crazy about weekend drives, even if I drive in the middle of the week. I'm just crazy about going over the roads and highways.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Coupling the artist's words with the paintings' titles—such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>], <span style="font-style:italic;">Merritt Parkway</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Interchange</span>—it is hardly surprising that critics have mentioned these canvases of 1957–1960 alongside the rapidly expanding American highway system.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> De Kooning's phrase "going to the city or coming from it" has led some to posit a transit-based interpretation: the highway paintings represent a space between the urban and the suburban. According to this logic, de Kooning's shift from his claustrophobic, so-called "urban" abstractions of the mid-1950s to the airy style of the highway paintings a few years later mirrors the simultaneous middle-class abandonment of the inner city, a process certainly spurred on by new freeway construction.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> De Kooning himself participated in such urban shifts: he spent increasing amounts of time traveling by car between Manhattan and eastern Long Island during the late 1950s and early 1960s, before permanently settling in the Hamptons in 1963.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>De Kooning's remarks on the "sensations" associated with driving have encouraged a second, more representational, reading of these paintings in relation to highways: landscapes as viewed from a speeding car.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This interpretation provides a ral frame through which to view these canvases; they are landscapes mediated by automotive movement. Viewers can apparently see blurred impressions of grass, water, and sky in the paintings' broad planes of color.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>With the art historical paydirt of de Kooning's comments and titles, critics have failed to probe deeper, neglecting the complex interrelation between highway driving, gestural abstraction, and individual subjectivity at the end of the 1950s. I believe that these paintings are not merely illustrative of an American culture in transition, but rather are deeply engaged with its anxieties, triumphs, and contradictions.</p>
<p>Through their address of the seemingly disparate spheres of "action painting" and driving, de Kooning's highway paintings engage both artistic modernism and social modernization, describing how ideologies of the former enabled an expansion of the latter. De Kooning connects these spheres—driving and painting, the spatial and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> pictorial—through a discourse that coalesces around the dual meanings of the word "sign." First, the paintings embody the logic of the new interstate culture: simplified, standardized <span style="font-style:italic;">road</span> signs of action painting. Second, the highway paintings are a culmination of de Kooning's involvement with <span style="font-style:italic;">semiotic</span> signs: they demonstrate the increasing impossibility of unmediated expression within culture, despite lingering mythologies of authenticity. Ultimately, the duality of these paintings—that they appear as both triumphant and tragic in relation to subjectivity—makes them crucial utterances of this conflicted moment of the late 1950s, a moment when America was on the verge of pop art and postmodernity.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Action Painting and Driving</h1>
<p>When Harold Rosenberg coined the term "action painting" in 1952, he had de Kooning's slashing, gestural style in mind.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> For the critic, painters should not approach a blank canvas with a preconceived notion of subject matter, but rather use the process of painting itself as a means of expressing the doubts and struggles of the postwar world. From the start, the existential angst of this style was loosely connected to car culture, as discourses of speed and risk rhetorically structured both.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> With his comments about highways, de Kooning's paintings from the late 1950s literally mark a convergence of driving and what Rosenberg called the "arena" of action painting. De Kooning, however, was not the only artist to register such a connection in the 1950s; in fact, it was his friend Robert Rauschenberg who first explored the relationship.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1953—just a few months after "The American Action Painters" appeared—Rauschenberg was busy erasing a heavily worked de Kooning drawing, given to him by the older artist for this intended purpose. According to the story, Rauschenberg labored for nearly a month with many erasers to remove the gestural traces of the artist. The result, a work called <span style="font-style:italic;">Erased de Kooning</span>, is an expression of negation as an artistic gesture in its own right. During the same period, Rauschenberg produced a second important work on this theme, <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>, in collaboration with John Cage [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. While Cage slowly drove a Model A Ford over a 21-foot length of paper in downtown Manhattan, Rauschenberg continually applied ink to one of the car's rear tires—thus producing a long image of a tire print.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> This resulting mark is formally similar to the brushstrokes that were the hallmark of action painters—a point made clear by comparing Rauschenberg's print to the bold, grayish vertical brushstroke on the right side of de Kooning's famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>] from 1950–52. Both forms exhibit a marked linearity and parallel grooves within their borders. Despite the multivalent interpretations that Rauschenberg's tire print willfully engenders, its conflation of the automobile and action painting cannot be ignored.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>These two works by Rauschenberg are more than temporally related; both critique the idea of the unique painterly gesture fundamental to the mythology of action painting. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Erased de Kooning</span>, Rauschenberg negates the emotive overtones of the drawing. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>, he reconres the mechanical tire print as a mock-expressive brushstroke, complete with the "accidental" drips and spatters accrued in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the process. In these two works, Rauschenberg murders and then mocks the heroic brushstroke of the action painters, but does so in the second instance with a clear allusion to car culture.</p>

<p>De Kooning eventually strikes back; his majestic 1958 painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> can be viewed as an artistic rejoinder to Rauschenberg, with its giant brushstroke that resembles a tire print in both size and appearance. After Rauschenberg's erasure and subsequent conflation of the brushstroke with car culture, de Kooning recodes the tire print back into a painterly gesture, producing a mark that appears, on the surface, heroic, masculine, and strong. With its title, "Montauk Highway," de Kooning makes the picture's relationship to Rauschenberg and driving explicit.</p>
<p>In his reclamation of the brushstroke, de Kooning reinvests the form with at least a façade of existential credibility. The artist's words from 1959 describing his painting process support this idea: "I'm not trying to be a virtuoso … but I have to do it fast. It's not like poker, where you can build a straight flush or something. It's like throwing dice. I can't save anything."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> This language of danger and speed, of course, recalls Rosenberg's notion of the risk involved in action painting. A look of velocity is certainly present in the lightning quick, rust-colored brushstroke in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>. No curves or lateral wrist movement slow down the swash of the brush; de Kooning's performativity—how the brushstroke connotes its own making—allows for a visualization of painted speed, especially the mark's abrupt start or stop toward the bottom of the canvas. These bold, tire-like brushstrokes are a staple in other highway canvases like <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Lisbeth's Painting</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolton Landing</span> , thus demonstrating de Kooning's engagement with an associative conflation of painterly and automotive speed, including the associated "risks" of both.</p>
<p>This dialogue between de Kooning and Rauschenberg had cultural implications beyond friendly artistic rivalry. For critic Leo Steinberg, works like <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span> represented a shift from nature to culture, manifested in a move from the vertical picture plane capturing emotional or natural sensations to a horizontal "flatbed": <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>… Rauschenberg's picture plane had to become a surface to which anything reachable-thinkable would adhere. It had to be whatever a billboard or dashboard is, and everything a projection screen is, with further affinities for anything that is flat and worked over … Any flat documentary surface that tabulates information is a relevant analogue of his picture plane—radically different from the transparent projection plane with its optical correspondence to man's visual field.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Rauschenberg's tire print—itself a flatbed surface, capturing information—retroactively situates de Kooning's brushstroke in the realm of culture, something already mediated by social forces. De Kooning's marks in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> and other highway paintings, alternatively, maintain a complex ambivalence in relation to subjectivity: by reconring the tire print back into a bold, gestural brushstroke, it lingers between the horizontal flatbed and vertical window, between Steinberg's realms of nature and culture, between modernist alienation and postmodern mediation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Furthermore, Steinberg's own terms are themselves dependent upon the highway, as he uses concepts like billboards, dashboards, and flatbeds (a type of cargo truck) in his written description. It is as if the fault line between the modern and postmodern is the open road itself, a point reiterated by Michael Fried's 1967 connection of minimal art's "incurable" theatricality to Tony Smith's drive on the New Jersey Turnpike.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> De Kooning's highway paintings confuse and conflate these realms; they are simultaneously the last gasp of modernist autonomy as well as an early breath of postmodern mediation.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Standardization and Franchises: Highway/Paintings</h1>
<p>In May 1959, a 55-year-old de Kooning had a one-person show at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York—his first since 1956—filled with a number of highway paintings. <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine recapped the opening day of the unusually popular exhibition:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>As early as 8:15 in the morning on opening day, collectors were queuing up outside 57<sup>th</sup> Street's Sidney Janis Gallery, jostling for first peeks and early buys. By noon, 19 of the shows 22 oils were sold … At week's end a new De [sic] Kooning was not to be had for love or money. Shyly backed against a wall as the crowd milled through the gallery, De [sic] Kooning was startled and pleased: 'There's no way of astonishing anyone any more. I'm selling my own image now. It's being understood. That's the way it's supposed to be.'<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Lines outside a gallery and collectors jockeying for position hardly sound like the trappings associated with the avant-garde. As the artist himself noted, any pretension of radicalism in these canvases—and the related ideas of shocking the middle class—was missing by 1959. De Kooning's paintings sold like hotcakes; even the semblance of alienation had disappeared.</p>
<p>Not only were these paintings apparently "being understood" by his public, scores of artists were also imitating de Kooning's distinctive style and brushwork. In 1959, Thomas Hess addressed the emulation which began after the artist's 1956 exhibition: "the process of dilution has continued, reaching a high-comic point as young artists make whole one-man shows out of a studio idea swallowed whole from still unfinished de Kooning paintings."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The artist's brushwork, once considered emblematic of direct, unmediated subjective experience, was quickly coming to signify an empty, endlessly copied gesture. Clement Greenberg also noticed de Kooning's influence on a group of abstract artists, who all worked and gathered around 10<sup>th</sup> Street in downtown Manhattan. In 1964 the critic labeled such gestural mannerism the "Tenth Street touch."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Greenberg explained that what turned this emulation into "something bad as art was its standardization, … as a dozen, and then a thousand, artists proceeded to maul the same viscosities of paint … into the same kind of picture."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Put simply, the effects of action painting had begun to be mass-produced; it became a system to adopt, a posture to assume, and a brand to buy. Artists like Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns had been implying the banality of abstract expressionist heroism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and brushwork for a number of years (like in <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>), but commercial success and artistic imitation began to render such contradictions explicit by 1959.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> T. J. Clark has suggested that the self-conscious, overblown "vulgarity" of canvases like de Kooning's highway paintings register the socioeconomic conditions of this historic moment, thematizing their own emptiness for aspirational patrons who did not know any better.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For Clark, the mannered, vulgar existentialism of these paintings was an ideal commodity at the end of the 1950s. De Kooning's words, "I'm selling my own image now," certainly express this condition.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In a sense, de Kooning's mass production, the standardization of his art, paralleled the growing discourse of the highway. As Thomas Hess and others lamented the homogeneity of action painting, the construction for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways was well underway. In 1956, President Eisenhower signed into law the Federal Aid Highway Act, which allowed for this construction—a proposed network of 41,000 miles of roads linking most American cities with a population of 50,000 or more. This expensive legislation (the federal government was to foot 90% of the bill) was pushed through Congress largely by appealing to the project's connection to economic growth and national defense needs—military mobility and speedy urban evacuations in case of nuclear attack.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> A drive on the interstate, then, could not only be viewed as a rebellious escape from the post-war world (as articulated in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Road</span>) but also as something simultaneously attached to official narratives of prosperity and survival in the atomic age.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> By provocatively combining the realms of action painting and the highway at this exact moment, de Kooning intuited a way to address the crisis of subjectivity inherent to both artistic modernism and larger questions of modernization.</p>
<p>The new interstate system fundamentally restructured society; for one, it reproduced its own bureaucratic structures in the areas surrounding interchanges, according to Keller Easterling.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such logic helped to create one of the most influential business practices of the last 50 years: franchising. In a study of this economic and cultural phenomenon, Thomas Dicke has posited that by the late 1950s, the number of franchisers had reached a "critical mass," as investors realized that more money was to be made in selling a business system (like a whole restaurant) instead of just an individual product (like a hamburger).<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Entrepreneurs established gas and fast food franchises in the 1930s, but the business model exploded with interstate construction, as the mobile landscape provided an ideal setting for these new ventures.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In the world of national roadways, a recognizable sign and familiar food would be comforting—endowing an undifferentiated landscape with a uniform sense of place.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's highway paintings respond to this franchised culture of the interstate in two ways. First, the canvases are streamlined to the point where they become clear road-signs of action painting. Second, they demonstrate the commodity-like serialization of ostensibly subjective gestures.</p>
<p>De Kooning's refined style is the first key to <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>'s structural engagement with highway culture. The grime and detail that de Kooning noticed when walking Manhattan streets in the mid-1950s and captured in a dense, cluttered painting like  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>] was lost on the interstate and in the highway paintings. Furthermore, these canvases not only appear to connote speed with their quick strokes, but their basic pictorial forms can also be apprehended in a flash, or, to use de Kooning's words, with a mere "glimpse."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, for instance, the subject is direct; an exaggerated, reddish brushstroke is clearly visible in a largely uniform yellow field.</p>
<p>In some ways, then, de Kooning's highway paintings replicate the visual realities of the interstate. Franchises located at interchanges required direct and efficient signage that might be understood with only a passing glance. Since motorists would usually be speeding though these highway corridors, traditional small signs announcing an upcoming restaurant or gas station would no longer suffice.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> As Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour later noted in their seminal <span style="font-style:italic;">Learning from Las Vegas</span> , the "graphic sign in space has become the architecture of this [suburban] landscape."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Even whole buildings began to function as signs and advertisements, designed to capture passing, mobile attention. It was these highways, suburbs, and franchises in the 1950s, then, that begot the 1970s landscape based largely on standardized commerce—a bureaucratic space designed to create and reflect consumer desire.</p>
<p>Considering the appearance of these highway paintings, it is no surprise that de Kooning was a successful commercial painter and store window designer in New York during the 1930s, as they have the immediacy of an effective commercial sign. The scale of the paintings only heightens such effects, as some of them tower over six-feet; perhaps a billboard aesthetic was on de Kooning's mind.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In 1960, the artist revealed his affection for such roadside signs: "Some people want to take the signs [on the highway] away, but it would break my heart. All those different big billboards."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1968, in the same essay in which he tackles Rauschenberg's "flatbed picture plane," Leo Steinberg uses these notions of efficient, quick communication to discuss Kenneth Noland's long, horizontal striped canvases from the late 1960s. To the critic, these pictures represented the "idealization of efficient speed," as they eliminate any element hindering direct expression.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> And while Steinberg does not mention de Kooning's highway paintings specifically, they also, some ten year earlier, clearly participated in such a discourse of effective communication.</p>
<p>That is not to say, however, that a painting like <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> smoothes over all surface nuances; it is the painting's hand-made quality that allows both the mythologizing of heroic subjectivity and the postmodern condition of its mediation. These highway paintings are not the most efficient signs in the commercial sense—leave that to Noland in the late 1960s or certain earlier examples of pop art—but they maintain just enough friction to make them akin to road signs of action painting.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The surface of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> furthers this reading of action painting as an effective commercial road sign. The bright, almost reflective quality of the crusty yellow paint belongs to the highway, recalling both the hue of warning signs and road paint.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> By leaving subtle pentimenti in the canvas—the gestural traces of blue and red just visible beneath the yellow coating on the right side—de Kooning makes the very act of refinement an explicit subject of this painting. Clearly done with the undercoat dry, de Kooning's act of yellow over-painting renders a more direct canvas, taming  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the nuances and surface incident found in earlier canvases like <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span>. However, de Kooning leaves a patch of bare canvas at the bottom right corner of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, and this is where the sign-quality of the painting falters. It can remind viewers that covering is an active gesture—that "refinement" and its associated destruction is a choice.</p>

</div>
<p>This interpretation of abstract expressionism based on speed of viewing goes beyond de Kooning's highway paintings; modalities of speed can be used as an organizing principle for mid-century American painting in general. If Pollock's lines enact a logic of barely controllable speed on the part of the artist, the simplicity of other artists' works from later in the 1950s embodies a shift to faster perception on the part of the spectator.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In his 1955 essay "American Type Painting," Greenberg elevated the more refined, geometric abstractions of Barnett Newman (monochrome fields with vertical lines called "zips") and Mark Rothko (floating squares that echo the frame) above the work of other American painters, including the more gestural painting of de Kooning and Pollock.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> And a decade later, Michael Fried, who largely followed in Greenberg's footsteps, described a successful painting as one in which "a single brief instant would be long enough to see everything."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> One can thus interpret the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Greenbergian mandate for the continuing refinement of pictorial means as producing paintings more like efficient commercial signs, clear forms with less visible evidence of the human hand. Simplified expression, therefore, is one place where the wires of modernist refinement and postmodernist mediation first cross.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> De Kooning's highway paintings stage this contradiction explicitly; they are, to repeat, something akin to road signs of gestural abstraction.</p>
<p>De Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>], also from 1958, similarly features <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>'s yellow pigment, but demonstrates another prominent mandate of franchising: seriality, the same consistent product over and over.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> The row of arching yellow shapes visible just below the horizon-like line, for example, is almost industrial in its hand-drawn repetition; one can imagine the machine-like motion of de Kooning's hand, painting one arch after another. The two red brushstrokes brashly converging right above the artist's signature also appear analogous, only executed in different directions. <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> is a hand-painted, faux-expressive version of pop art's later repetition strategies, visible in something like Andy Warhol's serialized images of Marilyn Monroe begun in 1962. This effect is found throughout other highway paintings; in the brighter palate of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruth's Zowie</span> , six bluish-black brushstrokes of comparable length and width appear on the right half of the picture, their direction varying slightly with each slash. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tree in Naples</span> , two very similar zigzag patterns appear in different colors, with different spatial orientations, in the bottom third of the canvas. Such repetition strategies not only help to create more standardized canvases, but are also an acknowledgement of the mass production of a canned subjectivity in painting. The slight alterations in direction or orientation, however, allow these paintings to read more as signs of action painting than as pop. This reversibility and ambivalence is their power.</p>
<p>Road signs and seriality come together in a remarkable passage in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Suburb in Havana</span>, namely where the two converging reddish brushstrokes form a "V" and support two of the serialized golden marks. The "V" looks a bit like scaffolding holding aloft an italicized "M"; it can be read as a flat representation of a sign in a landscape. Not unrelated to the painting at hand, the fast food chain McDonald's began its franchising operations in 1952 and opened its first Long Island branch in the suburban community of Islip in 1958, the same year <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> was painted.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Islip is located on the south shore of Long Island, roughly between Manhattan and the Hamptons. The "golden arches"—which de Kooning's "M" resembles—were immediately part of McDonald's architectural signage, as seen in its standard building from the mid-1950s [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>]. De Kooning was likely aware of this new restaurant phenomenon, as the Islip franchise was located right on the Montauk Highway—a popular route to the Hamptons in the 1950s and the title of one of the highway paintings already discussed.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> This iconographic whiff of vulgar, franchised culture in the rarefied art world—like the line outside of his Sidney Janis exhibition in 1959—revealed de Kooning's engagement with franchising, to those who cared to notice.</p>
<p>Such an inclusion, it is important to note, is consistent with de Kooning's broader artistic practice. With a background in commercial art like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and James Rosenquist, de Kooning would not have ignored such apparently  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "low" sources as a McDonald's logo. In fact, de Kooning's proto-pop collage practice (gluing mouths cut from magazines into drawings of women from the early 1950s, for instance), demonstrate a long-standing interest in mass cultural sources.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Such recognizable images, however, do not reduce <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> to being simply about "McDonalds" or "automotive culture." Instead, such gestures situate this and other paintings securely within a dialogue connecting abstraction to ration, as well as connecting artistic modernity to larger issues of social modernization.</p>

<p>With their sign-like nature and seriality, the highway paintings are as close to pop as de Kooning would get. They are not far from Lichtenstein's <span style="font-style:italic;">Brushstroke</span> series of the mid-1960s, where the pop artist showed only the emptiness and Benday-dot reproducibility of the gesture, without its reversibility and ability to actually read as serious [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>]. The highway paintings are both among the last action paintings and the first pop paintings, and de Kooning knew it: "I'm selling my own image now" sounds almost Warholian. De Kooning, however, could never cross into pure pop art, as to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">him it lacked innocence; it traded Steinberg's idea of nature for culture.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The artist's work needed the tension between the two realms. And it is de Kooning's mannered naiveté and expressive fatalism—a type of starry-eyed world-weariness—that makes these highway paintings an endgame for him.</p>
<p>As such, a number of contemporary reviewers sensed something final about these canvases in 1959; the pictures, for instance, were a "passionately desired terminus," according to Dore Ashton.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> His radical shift to a baroque ration in 1963 suggests that there was some truth in this. And while one can say that the highway paintings occupy a position between the traditional picture plane and the flatbed, between the modern and postmodern, a larger story needs to be told: mainly, how did de Kooning arrive at this point where he wanted to flaunt subjective expression, as well as show its futility and commodification?</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Semiotic Signs to Nowhere</h1>
<p>De Kooning's 1958 canvas <span style="font-style:italic;">Detour</span> [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>] will close one aspect of my discussion of these highway paintings as signs, while opening another. In this picture, the artist brushes on a large pinkish-white triangle through an economy of slashing strokes. By allowing a singular form to overwhelm the picture—like <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>—and naming the canvas after a road sign, de Kooning again employs the highway and its logic as a way to address the sign and commodity status of his own painting. But "detour" is also a very particular kind of road sign—indicating an alternative, less-direct way to arrive at one's desired destination. As highway signs go, this one is arguably the most important, as it can be the driver's only beacon through a maze of unfamiliar roads—producing an experience completely mediated by signs.</p>
<p>Considering this, de Kooning not only enlisted the highway to address the domestication of subjectivity in painterly and spatial terms, but also to address the semiotic implications of the franchised landscape. The highway paintings, therefore, are about signs in two ways: those on the roadside <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> those constituting the very nature of expression. For someone so attuned to the nuances and puns of language, de Kooning was likely aware of both the high and low variances of the word "sign" when painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Detour</span>.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> His interest in slippery language carries over, of course, into his painting. He repeatedly depicts certain images that can be read in two ways simultaneously: tire print and brushstroke, serialized gestures and McDonald's logo.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>As a commercial artist in the 1920s and 1930s, de Kooning produced signs for New York businesses and illustrations for magazine advertisements.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Scholars have repeatedly noted that some of the methods and materials from his commercial work filtered into de Kooning's "fine art" painting.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> For instance, he often used a delicate sign-painters brush and commercial sign paints when creating his black-and-white abstractions from the late 1940s that gave him his first critical success. In a number of these canvases, de Kooning even employed legible commercial lettering as the basis for otherwise abstract compositions. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Zurich</span> [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>] from 1947, one sees how de Kooning used the letters "Z," "O," and "T," in addition to other more painterly marks, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">to create a charged field of forms in tension. Critics, including Greenberg, argued that the shallow space and reduced palette in these black-and-white paintings are indebted to the analytic cubism of Pablo Picasso.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> More than this, both artists are engaged with questions of semiotics, but in different ways.</p>
<p>For instance, Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ma Jolie</span> from 1911–12 posits a radical reconsideration concerning the very nature of representation. He cleaves the techniques for painterly depth (like shading and shadow) away from traditional representational practices, revealing their arbitrary and linguistic nature in the process.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Picasso, like de Kooning, also uses letters, stenciling "Ma Jolie" at the picture's bottom center. Read in conjunction with Picasso's other marks and considering its linguistic uncertainty (does it reference his current lover, a refrain from a popular song in 1911, or both?), these letters suggest an ambiguity at the heart of communication, whether linguistic or pictorial.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's cubism builds upon Picasso's. The younger artist's letters are arbitrary, yet they begin to exert a carnal presence, like they are ting to signify flesh through their rigid forms.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> The curved shape on the right side of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zurich</span>, for instance, looks to be a remnant of a vestigial "P" or "R"—as well as an organic bodily contour. By the time of <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting</span> in 1948 and <span style="font-style:italic;">Attic</span> of 1949, his "letters" are largely unrecognizable as linguistic signifiers; they had fully mutated into ambiguous breasts, buttocks, or other body parts twisting around in an arena of the erotic.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> And through de Kooning's style of painting—with sharp demarcations of certain planes, sometimes achieved through masking Picasso's edges—the morphed "letters" take on attributes of fragments collaged from signs or bodies. Rendered arbitrarily equivalent and meaningless, these bits add up to an erotically charged emptiness: all surface, no real depth. This visual uncertainty, in some ways, is a source of the existentialism associated with the late 1940s paintings. Through investigating signs and not simply following them, one could think about the arbitrariness of communication as a surrogate for an unanchored human life.</p>
<p>To reiterate, de Kooning's background in advertising is important, especially for his mass cultural understanding of semiotics. These black and white pictures demonstrate how commercial art is not about the surface or textual meaning, but instead about the <span style="font-style:italic;">intertext</span>—the bodily desire lurking behind commercial letters. As semioticians have argued, most advertisements carry both an overt and a latent meaning. The first is a literal reading of the text, the second is created when a viewer mentally synthesizes all of an ad's elements—joining text and image, for instance. This latent meaning creates consumer desire, but the overt aspects serve to naturalize this desire through its apparent transparency and stability.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>These ideas emerge in de Kooning's commercial work. The artist's illustrations of men smoking pipes, for instance, appeared in a 1943 <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span> magazine advertisement for Model tobacco [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>].<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> An image of a packet of the advertised product appears along the bottom, but in the middle of the page is <span style="font-style:italic;">another</span> kind of model, a color photograph of a posing woman. On the surface, the text "Home is where your Model is" is clear and to the point: this is a tobacco that is attached to ideas of domesticity. But the latent meanings—driven home by the text "Make a Date with Model," de Kooning's men hovering above the woman, and the mail-in offer for a full-color pin-up of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the female—sexualize the connection between the tobacco and the woman. With their commercial approach to cubism—showing how language commercially res flesh—de Kooning's black-and-white paintings not only express the linguistic uncertainty of language, but also how this very instability is the engine behind consumer desire that ultimately helped fuel the postwar economic boom.</p>

</div>
<p>In discussing his series of <span style="font-style:italic;">Women</span> paintings from the early 1950s de Kooning explained to Thomas Hess his concept of "no-environment" that informs his pictures and clearly demonstrates an interest in semiotics:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>De Kooning claims that the modern scene is 'no-environment' and presents it as such. To make his point, he opened a tabloid newspaper and leafed through its illustrations. There was a politician standing next to an arched doorway and rusticated wall, but remove the return of the arch—the wall might be a pile of shoe boxes in a department store, or 'nothing.' … The modern image is without distinct character, probably because of the tremendous proliferation of visual sensations which causes duplicates to appear among unlikes.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although explained in rather humble language, de Kooning's "no-environment"—the 77 undecidability of space in contemporary photographic images—is the space of visual and semiotic ambiguity. Not only is language a dangerously arbitrary sign system—as viewed in the black and white paintings—but so are the photographic images used in the service of news and advertising, according to the "no-environment." Photos deploy an illusory stability.</p>
<p>By fully integrating his images of women into nowhere settings, de Kooning addresses the very fluidity of the postwar image. The surface of <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>], for instance, shows its age: it had been worked, scraped, and repainted off and on for two years. In an early state of the composition, a window clearly appeared over the woman's left shoulder.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> This form later disappeared—and then briefly reappeared—as de Kooning continued to evolve new environments for his subject. In the final version, a cross-like passage resembling a windowpane is visible in the location of the old window, maybe loosely alluding to one of the painting's past incarnations. Each trace of a past setting, or each changed context for his woman, thus affected the overall appearance of the painting. Seeing the same photographic image in different contexts—the same photo in a number of magazines, the same billboard in different sites, or the same pin-up hanging in different locations—engenders a comparable sense of its anchorless instability. The ways in which each encounter with a specific image changes subsequent viewings is part of <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span>'s struggle for life.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>It is fitting that Greenberg's concept of "homeless representation"—coined in 1962 and used to condemn de Kooning's work from the mid-1950s (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span>)—is virtually a synonym for "no-environment." Greenberg describes his conceit as "a plastic and descriptive painterliness that is applied to abstract ends but which continues to suggest representational ones."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Both "no-environment" and "homeless representation," then, imply an image without a fixed home. It is as if Greenberg understands the semiotic importance of de Kooning's project, but he cannot stomach its connections to the kitsch of mass culture.</p>
<p>De Kooning's studio practice of excising "a lot of mouths" from magazines and placing them into different painted and drawn images, confirms this interest in the fluidity of images.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> In fact, his technique as described by Hess in a 1953 <span style="font-style:italic;">Art News</span> essay "De Kooning Paints a Picture," internalizes this logic of the unstable signifier into his own studio practice: "Before making changes [on the canvas], De [sic] Kooning frequently interrupted the process of painting to trace with charcoal on transparent paper large sections of, or the whole composition. These would be cut apart and taped on the canvas in varying positions."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> By turning his own practice into one of painterly collaging, a way of expressing the fluidity of the fragments within his own image archive, de Kooning can express the macro-logic of image fluidity operating within consumer capitalism at the micro, sublimated level of his own paintings. If Picasso's cubist portraits treated the female body as a conjunction of unstable pictorial signifiers—flesh turned into sign—de Kooning's women reclaim their flesh, while signifying how this apparent wholeness still fails to connote experience.</p>
<p>Collage is often cited as the key moment for Picasso's cubist revolution of the sign: pasting newspaper onto blank paper res the very absence present at the heart of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> signifying. Depth, therefore, becomes something written on the field, but not represented.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> Cubist collage is also of vital importance to Greenberg: it is the first realization of a completely non-illusionistic, flat pictorial surface.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> While de Kooning had always been interested in aping the effects of collage in paint, his process of newspaper transfer in the mid-1950s more directly references this technique than previous works. The process is simple: de Kooning would press a sheet of newspaper flush against the canvas's wet surface and then remove it. The effect is two-fold. First, the pressing of newspaper onto a nuanced surface flattens out the outward signs of subjectivity, thus repressing the traces of the hand in that passage. More importantly, the action leaves a ghostly reverse-image of newsprint in the paint. The transfer, then, allows de Kooning to signify the no-environment of these abstractions (like Picasso signifying depth with only newsprint in his collages) without the continuous reworking associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span>. For de Kooning, the press image was a source of literal instability (its blurriness and reproducibility); by fusing it with paint—a medium tied to personal expression—he found a way to express the instability of the printed image while still painting, a theme that would find its full expression in the highway paintings.</p>
<p>The transfers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> are clearly visible on the left side and top edge of the painting [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. When coupled with its title and urban clutter, this canvas can represent the jumble of signification in the city, not only though its frenetic charcoal grime and twisting forms, but also at the very level of the sign and "no-environment." In the majestic <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter Monday</span> from 1955–56, the newspaper transfers threaten to overtake the entire painting; they are especially clear along the bottom and in the top right corner of the picture. This is, however, also the first painting where de Kooning's brushstrokes become broad and confident, and the clarity of the highway paintings is first glimpsed. It is at this point that de Kooning makes another radical pictorial discovery: he no longer needs newsprint or the evidence of a highly worked surface to express the instability of pictorial and linguistic signs. The painting's white brushstroke darting diagonally from the top edge (or, for that matter, the vertical yellow stroke just right of center), can signify nothingness just as well as the newsprint.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter Monday</span> de Kooning fused paint and newsprint to signify the shifting "no-environment" while still using paint. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, he takes the next logical step. In the specific moment of the late 1950s, de Kooning realized that he need no longer signify absence through recourse to explicitly cubist strategies but could do it merely through the abstract expressionist gesture writ large.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Because the conspicuous brushstroke had become empty with its reproducibility and class associations, it could signify its apparent opposite—thus making a death of painting look heroic.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Like his other "no-environment" of an ambiguous press photo, de Kooning's brushstroke seemed to have a physical, indexical anchor in his own experience and action. At this time, however, the mark was as mediated as an image in a popular advertisement—say, the woman in de Kooning's tobacco advertisement. In form and content, therefore, the highway paintings are about signs, both high and low, roadside and semiotic. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Interchange: Doom and Progress</h1>
<p>In his important essay "Myth Today," Roland Barthes, like de Kooning and Steinberg, uses driving to address the contemporary world in the late 1950s, making the relation between highway culture and semiotics explicit at that moment:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>If I am in a car and look at the scenery though the window, I can at will focus on the scenery or on the window-pane. At one moment I grasp the presence of the glass and the distance of the landscape; at another, on the contrary, the transparence of the glass and the depth of the landscape; but the result of this alternation is constant: the glass is at once present and empty to me, and the landscape unreal and full. The same thing occurs in the mythical signifier.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Drivers can view the passing landscape as both shallow—mediated by the window—and in a natural, unmediated depth dependant upon the glass's invisibility. The windshield reveals the cultural structuring of the landscape (as flat information, like Rauschenberg's surfaces) as well as its apparent naturalness (seen in depth, like a traditional view). This is semiotic uncertainty: things appear as both "nature" and "culture" when riding in a car.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> De Kooning would have had time to ponder such things: as someone who never learned to drive, he could focus solely on this visual uncertainty during his frequent front seat rides between Manhattan and the Hamptons during the 1950s.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>Driving plays more than a subsidiary role in a shift to a world of shallow images, a condition often related to postmodernity. Cultural theorist Margaret Morse has recognized that a car in motion on the freeway is an "intensely private space lifted out of the social world."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In her terms, it is a nonspace, "an elsewhere which inhabits the everyday."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Drawing on Barthes, she concludes that drivers and passengers float between "a real outside and an idealized representation," and such a duality fosters a new "fiction effect."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Motorists can view their life as a myth of control, the glass fetishizing their surroundings,<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> while the shift to a view in depth makes the experience appear as a given. Comparable to nineteenth-century colonial representations of foreign landscapes, the view through the car windshield can naturalize an ideology of modernization and spatial domination.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> As such, scholars have noted how traveling fast on the interstate fosters a "mastery of space"—making large things seem manageable, thus erasing feelings of personal inadequacy.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> The pattern is clear: whether pictorially (road sign) or spatially (semiotic sign), de Kooning's highway paintings occupy a position perennially in-between nature and culture, modernity and postmodernity.</p>
<p>In his powerful description of postmodernity, Jean Baudrillard relates an overriding cultural logic of "driving" with the novelty of televisual flatness in the world.<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> Subjects no longer experience the wholeness of an object, but only its flat, easily transmissible image. In his view, "the drama of alienation" had transformed into "the ecstasy of communication."<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> And while de Kooning's paintings do not express a full realization of such "ecstasy" (this would be the realm of certain pop art or Noland's late-1960s canvases of "idealized speed," discussed by Steinberg), they do embody a flatness that makes them comparable to a Baudrillardian sign. Importantly, however, a sense of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the "drama of alienation" is also present in the friction and physicality of de Kooning's brushstrokes.</p>
<p>As I have suggested, the flat nature of the highway paintings was among the qualities most noticed by the critics of de Kooning's 1959 exhibition.<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> This flatness is certainly evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, as the primary brushstroke sits on the surface of the picture plane, asserting its presence as a physical entity, not as a mark defining volume. Such flatness then can situate these paintings into a discourse now associated with Baudrillard's version of postmodernism. But after reading Barthes, one can also interpret these serialized arches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> as a series of diagonal lines receding back into the picture plane—a cursory, lazy way to depict painterly depth. Greenberg also saw depth in the artist's paintings from the period: "deep space is … increasingly suggested in almost everything de Kooning has done lately."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> So again, there is a sense of depth <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> flatness in the highway paintings—the same alternation of which Barthes speaks.</p>
<p>Steinberg argued in 1968 that many kinds of pictorial flatness exist. For him, Greenberg's influential definition was only one among many, and furthermore, it was largely arbitrary and ahistorical.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> De Kooning's fickle flatness, then, must be read in its own terms. It is not only a product of the cubist evolution that I have traced, but a way to use the experience of riding in a car to explore the individual's place in the late 1950s. In his highway paintings, de Kooning rethinks the "no-environment"; it becomes less about the false anchors of words or fluidity of images, but instead about the very instability of human subjectivity in such an image-based society of franchises and serialized gestures, despite the body's apparent anchors in the world. The paintings look expressive, but they are only superficially that, a consequence of the new flatness that Baudrillard describes.</p>
<p>Writing in 1958, the year of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway,</span> architectural critic Lewis Mumford understood exactly how driving itself could naturalize destruction: "Perhaps the only thing that could bring Americans to their senses would be a clear demonstration of the fact that their highway program will, eventually, wipe out the very area of freedom that the private motorcar promised to retain for them."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> Barthes also writes cogently about the process: "[myth] transforms history into nature"—or, to translate this into Steinberg's terms, culture into nature.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> It is this duality that enables destruction in the name of progress; it allows a drive on a raised inner-city portion of an interstate without thinking about the historical progress of traumas and dislocation its construction caused below.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Whether related to Jack Kerouac or the action painters, Mumford's ideas resonate with the stakes of this period: an empty gesture of subjectivity could naturalize and franchise subjectivity, reduce its sphere, and increase its colonization. As Morse states, echoing Foucault, the interstates are systems of control without the need for panoptical positions; they are "fully congruent with the values of individualism and hedonistic pleasure."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's paintings, however, move beyond the functioning of myth to reveal its very power structure. Since they address such serious issues as the franchising of gesture and landscape, one would expect these paintings to look melancholic or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> foreboding—to register consciously some of the period anxieties on the surface. These 81 paintings on the whole, however, are attractive canvases that would look great in a modern living room. Why else would 19 out of 22 of the highway paintings sell before noon at the exhibition's opening day in 1959? By making an image of the homogenization of self and place so desirable and attractive, these works not only demonstrate the upward aspirations of the middle classes, but also at the same time the way in which these groups willingly participated in and brought upon their own destruction and serialization. Through the mutual heroism and emptiness of his highway paintings, de Kooning marks these contradictory times: how, to quote Marshall Berman, various forces were destroying the world, while seeming "to be working in the name of values that we ourselves embraced."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> The sunny disposition of these canvases is the source of their tragedy: postmodern doom pictured as modernist progress.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f10" href="#f10-text">10. </a>The connection between driving and action painting manifests itself in a number of other anecdotal ways—whether in Jackson Pollock or Franz's Kline's penchant for fast cars, de Kooning's friendship with Jack Kerouac, or Pollock's famous 1956 death in a high-speed car crash in East Hampton.</p></div>

Walter Hopps and Susan Davidson (New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1997), 553. A number of commentators speak of a connection and friendship between de Kooning and Rauschenberg. In an earlier work, for instance, Rauschenberg collaged a newspaper reference to "DeKoning" [sic] into a work (Prather, "Catalogue," 134–5). And the fact that de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a drawing for the express purpose of erasure indicates a certain level of trust and understanding (Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, <span style="font-style:italic;">de Kooning: An American Master</span> [New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 2004], 358–60). Henceforth abbreviated as <span style="font-style:italic;">DKAM</span>.</p></div>

The paintings, however, were not actually painted exceedingly fast or spontaneously. Sketches exist for a number of the paintings, and their surfaces show evidence of extensive scraping and reworking. But this evidence is repressed—unlike his earlier work—in order to create an impression of speed.

Clark, <span style="font-style:italic;">Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism</span> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 401. Clark believes abstract expressionism is at its best when its over-expressive bravado is right on the surface, "because it is then that it grasps most fully the conditions of representation—the technical and social conditions—of its historical moment" . It is in this period (c. 1958–1962) that abstract expressionism became a form of visual currency to fuel the "petty bourgeoisie's aspirations to aristocracy" . In this essay, Clark reproduces two de Kooning highway paintings from the 1959 exhibition—<span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Merritt Parkway</span>—as exemplary of this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> process. The brushstrokes in these canvases are so expressive and so painterly, they have to be read as at least partly meretricious, according to Clark .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f22" href="#f22-text">22. </a>It was also around this time that abstract expressionism became official government policy—the ultimate gesture of domestication.

Steinberg also relates the story about the Fauvist painter Maurice Vlaminck, who said that he wanted to make paintings that would be visible to someone driving by in an automobile, thus demonstrating this need for a heightened visual efficiency in an earlier moment within artistic modernism.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>In 1953, Thomas Hess fancifully argues that de Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> should be used as a highway sign itself, "like those more-than-beautiful girls with their eternal smiles who do not tempt, but simply point to a few words or a beer or a gadget." Therefore, the painting-as-billboard discourse has a pre-history with de Kooning even before the highway paintings.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f36" href="#f36-text">36. </a>Clark would certainly label this pigment as "vulgar," as it seems consciously to court such low connections. Later in the 1960s, de Kooning went through his "Howard Johnson" phase of color (de Kooning's phrase), thus providing further evidence of his interest in the vulgar side of the roadside landscape.

For him, Claes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Oldenburg and Rauschenberg (among others) exhibit a "clumsy groundedness"  that captures the city in the midst of a crucial moment of historical transition: from the particularity and nuances of light industry to the hyperspace of a late capitalist metropolis fashioned from steel, glass, and geometry. Like de Kooning's highway paintings, the sculptures Shannon discussed occupy both an artistic and social pivot point between modernism and postmodernism.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f41" href="#f41-text">41. </a>How should viewers interpret the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span>? De Kooning recalled from his 1958 visit to Cuba (pre-Castro) that the country "was like being in New Jersey, except for the palm trees." Again, de Kooning demonstrates his "slippery" logic by connecting the disparate regions of New Jersey and Cuba through the concept of the suburb.

David Joselit has convincingly demonstrated that Duchamp's style of cubism circa 1914 posits an "infinite regress" between language and the carnal body. Language and sign systems are arbitrary <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> carnal for Duchamp; his paintings endow rationality with a sense of flesh, and vice versa.

<div id="body">
<p>One would assume that in its "originary" internationalism, modernist studies today is something of a naturally, even organically comparative field of literary studies; and that it is curious, then, that only with the recent rise of something [<span style="font-style:italic;">lse</span> supplemental to or superseding internationalism, called transnationalism (and "transnational studies") that relationships between European and non-European modernist movements have begun to be analyzed both conspicuously and rigorously. Whether we take it as the fullest development of a globalizing project always already implicit within modernist studies, or as an innovative new turn in the field, this displacement seems to draw on the idea of both material and reciprocal imaginary connection at scales and across greater distances than might previously have been accepted as plausible. Still, any such expansion of a field is bound to have both its creative and its critical exponents, and it is possible to discern at least two major strains of the new transnationalist modernist studies today. While one tendency among scholars and critics working on the edge of the field is to re-read from modernism not only the "international," but the full-blown global travel of modernist aesthetic forms and movements, another is to turn (or return) to the study of literatures in their particularized locality, continuing a critique of the parochialism of canonical Europeanist modernism and modernist studies.</p>
<p>A recent and invaluable contribution to the first area, for example, traces the "traffic in manifestos" across trans-European and transatlantic travel routes, sketching the elusive re of "an international avant-garde … at large."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> For Martin Puchner, translocalization of the art of the manifesto expresses both the mobility and the diffusion of the modernization project in avantgarde<span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rather than "the" avant-garde; what it resists, meanwhile, is the seldom explicit, yet often tacit and conventional critical ration of <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> single world modernization project. Such scholars as Dubravka Djurić, Miško Šuvaković, and Miryam Sas, on the other hand, have "comparatized" modernist studies by documenting the heterogeneity of literary modernisms that those very res of traffic and circulation can (if not in Puchner's own careful analysis) tend to obscure. In their collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Impossible Histories: Historical Avant-Gardes, Neo-Avant-Gardes, and Post-Avant-Gardes in Yugoslavia 1918-1991</span> , Djurić and Šuvaković particularize <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> comparison the richly diverse aesthetic cultures of Zagreb, Belgrade, and Ljubljana, in a Balkans-within-Europe disavowed as Europe's other.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In her study of Japanese surrealism, meanwhile, Sas (in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fault Lines: Cultural Memory and Japanese Surrealism)</span> argues for the value of surrealist juxtaposition—of distant, particular or local realities—as a model for transcultural exchange.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> In Sas's work it is Japanese, rather than European surrealism which finds the historical limits of critical models for intercultural influence. "Here," she writes of a specifically "Japanese" practice of surrealism, "the 'West' becomes a space that transcends its 'real' position and begins to function as an ideal place, a place that provides material for the Japanese writers' poetic encounters, as well as a screen upon which their fantasies may be projected."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My goal in what follows is to supplement these new gestures of and <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> comparison, in both modes. My contribution is a reading of the Turkish encounter with surrealism recorded and dramatized in a unique essay by critic Ismayıl Hakkı Baltacıoğlu (1886-1978). <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> ("Turkish Script Arts"; 1958), I will suggest here, maps a complexly refracted intersection of Western European and Turkish literary histories, one which we might think as exemplary in its very frustration of the exemplarity on which comparison, very conventionally, depends.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>A "socio-psychological essay on the graphology and the aesthetics of Turkish script arts," to take the work's subtitle, Baltacıoğlu's book-length essay contrasts "Turkish Islamic writing" with the geometric abstraction of Latin letters, proposing a comparative anatomy of the two Turkish alphabets used during the twentieth century. Cataloging the Arabo-Persian letters used in Ottoman Turkish, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> Baltacıoğlu reads each letter of the pre-1928 alphabet as the scriptural paradox of a non-rative representation of the human body arranged in an expressive pose. (The essay is supplemented and illustrated with photographs, diagrams, and charts designed to assist the reader in transvisualizing Arabo-Persian lettering into human forms.) My suggestion will be that what the essay performs is not a comparison merely internal to the national cultural history of modern Turkey, but rather a kind of extant record of a transnational comparative literary modernity. The author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> argues that the non-rative representation he reads in Turkish Islamic letters anticipates elements of European surrealist art practice in the early twentieth century, and he does so in terms that make comparison explicit—though as a kind of West-East comparison "in reverse," in a substantive defamiliarization of that comparison's ground.</p>
<p>My point will be that Baltacıoğlu's "alliance" (or dalliance) with surrealism cannot be understood as part of a (smaller or larger) Turkish "surrealist movement," and that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this is precisely why it is interesting. Where the Turkish cultural scene of the early 49 1930s included no shortage of avant-garde formations (such as the notorious "d Group") whose goal was to remake Turkish art using imported cubist, constructivist, and expressionist techniques, Baltacıoğlu aimed instead for a reconciliation or even continuity of European surrealist style with traditional Turkish art practices. Neither the artifact of an obscured and lost local avant-garde <span style="font-style:italic;">scene</span>, nor an exemplar of and in some global surrealist circuit, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> suggests a mode of singularity we might use to re-evaluate the very epistemological categories of comparative literary history.</p>
<p>In advancing this argument, I will situate <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> in the context of the radical alphabet reform of the modern Turkish republic. The reform of 1928 replacing Arabo-Persian lettering with Latin phonetic orthography was one component of the state modernization project modeled on European enlightenment principles. This reform succeeded, we could say, in secularizing and rationalizing the medium of writing. Baltacıoğlu's reading of human form in Turkish Islamic lettering performs a struggle, very much characteristic of this tumultuous period of linguistic modernization, between this modernizing desacralization and a consequent or concurrent <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span>sacralization of writing. <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, I will suggest, opens itself to the fundamental ambiguities in the rationalizing processes of modernity, including that rationalizing process at the heart of critical comparison itself. And one consequence of pushing these ambiguities will perhaps be the collapse of hierarchical models for comparing Turkey with and to an always already "surrealist Europe"—revealing a ground of comparison for "Europe" and "Turkey" as comparable sites of and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">crisis</span> of modernity. Now that recent criticism has recovered comparative literature's quasi-European, "marginal" origin, in Leo Spitzer and Erich Auerbach's exilic years of teaching in Turkey, we might turn to the work of someone like Baltacıoğlu—dismissed from his post at the Istanbul <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun</span> (Istanbul University) during the 1933 university reform that brought Spitzer and Auerbach there—for another comparative history.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Anatomy of Alphabets</h1>
<p>A calligrapher and journal editor,<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> as well as an academic, Ismayıl Hakkı Baltacıoğlu published extensively on the history of Turkish script arts during a long career spanning four crucial periods of modern Turkish history.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> As what we might consider a mosaic of writing's different temporalities, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> incorporates sections of Baltacıoğlu's earlier essays from these different periods.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> This compound temporality of the text is itself a testament to the complex history of Turkish linguistic modernization, about which I want first to review some important details.</p>
<p>An admixture of Turkish with Persian and Arabic vocabulary, written in a script combining Arabic and Persian letter forms,<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Ottoman Turkish had been the "high" written language of the literati and the state since the fourteenth century, its cultivated use the product of intense training.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The politics of its differentiation from vernacular Turkish were complex well before the twentieth century and the republican period I focus on here, and proposals to simplify the language and to reform its orthography had  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> been made as early as the mid-nineteenth-century, with the spread of print technologies and the rapid mass distribution of printed materials. These proposals included the introduction of new vocalization diacritics designating each distinct vowel sound, as well as spacing the letters of each word individually, instead of writing joined script.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>It was during the republican period, however, that the most radical measures were taken. After its emergence from the Ottoman imperial core in 1923, the Turkish republic launched a project of state-led social engineering that sought to replace all Ottoman-Islamic institutions with institutions modeled on those of Western Europe. Within a few years of the birth of the republic, the caliphate had been abolished, religious schools and courts had been shut, and the wearing of traditional clothing had been banned. Scholars of Turkish politics have described this positivist and rationalist revolutionary project as a "non-European will to civilization" in a Muslim setting.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The Turkish language itself became a crucial technology for the discipline of modern national Turkish subjects, as the republic abolished altogether the Arabo-Persian lettering of the Ottoman alphabet, replacing it with Latin letters in 1928, and began a systematic purge of Arabic and Persian words from the language during the 1930s.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>As a witness to this complex history, Baltacıoğlu attempted to memorialize the history of Turkish script arts at a time when they were being marginalized by the modernization programs. His reproduction, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, of the following passage from his own "Türk Yazılarının Tetkikine Methal" ("An Introduction to the Examination of Turkish Scripts," 1927) emphasized a long-held desire to archive this history:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>My consciousness of Turkish script arts is not made of abstract words and concepts; it's a live one produced by my whole being and personality. It's true that after studying natural sciences in the science department at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun</span>,<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> I became a teacher. This diversion distanced me from calligraphy and other works of intuition. It was as if there was an opposition between the thinking of child, school, method, and breeding [<span style="font-style:italic;">terbiye</span>] and of line [<span style="font-style:italic;">satır</span>] and composition [<span style="font-style:italic;">istif</span>]. I gradually found myself leaving my former interests for my new career. But one longing, one desire kept preoccupying me. And this was to write a history of Turkish script arts, which had woven my taste.</p>
<div class="attrib">([<span style="font-style:italic;">YS</span>, 85)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Excepting some simplification of word choice, the passage incorporated into [<span style="font-style:italic;">ürklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> is substantively identical to that in the 1927 essay. Yet Baltacıoğlu makes no explicit reference to that essay or to its 1934 reprint (though he does so in other sections of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, when quoting it directly).<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> This arguably unconscious repetition might be said to mark the persistence of the memory-trace of a displaced writing practice. At the same time, as repetition, it points also to the difficulty of memorialization itself, which more often entails revisiting the traces of the past—as a kind of "circling" them—than successfully restoring them. In Baltacıoğlu's case, the project of memorialization was made all the more difficult by the reforms, and it was 1958 before he managed to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> as a kind of comparative anatomy of the Latin and Arabo-Persian alphabets.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>On the whole, we can say, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> argues from a conservative nationalist position, aiming to restore traditional cultural practices to the "spiritual creative  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> life" of the new nation: "to steer Turkish modernization," as Nazım İrem has put it, "through a new vision of conservative modernity."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Baltacıoğlu belonged to a group of republican intellectuals who turned to the "other West" of romanticism, spiritualism, and Bergsonism, in critique of the materialism of the modernization project.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> For Baltacıoğlu, cultural practices have a timeless and unchanging living essence, and nationhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">milliyet)</span> is constituted by a fixed cultural tradition (<span style="font-style:italic;">gelenek) (TYS</span>, 79). The study of language, as a sediment of traditional social forms, consequently advances the cause of transhistorical and unified traditional social value (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 84).</p>
<p>Still, Baltacıoğlu's positions contain nuances, or perhaps outright contradictions, that are worth noting. While he resisted the positivistic rationalism of the state's nationalization programs, he also had an anti-Ottoman cultural nationalist agenda of his own. Baltacıoğlu's anti-Ottomanism is evident in his identification of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet as "Turkish Islamic." One goal of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, we must note, is to posit a mythic Turkishness uncontaminated by Arabic or Persian influence. For Baltacıoğlu, Turkish Islamic script writing is an essentially somatic and gestural, as well as a communicative activity: in the training and active practice of Turkish calligraphers, he tells us (unlike that of Arabic calligraphers), the shapes of letters were schematically linked to parts of the human body. Turkish calligraphers, Baltacıoğlu argues, had an elaborate vocabulary for letter anatomy, referring to the "head, eyebrow, eye, nose, foot, stomach," and so on of a letter (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 19). This is an Islamic tradition extending back into and from mystical theories of writing as far as the fourteenth century, in the Hurufi formulations of Fadlullah of Astarabad (1339-1394),<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> with both Ottoman court and Sufist poetic traditions making extensive use of similes comparing the beloved with lettering shapes.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, Baltacıoğlu literalizes and extends this metaphoric anatomical language—for example, finding "the sideways profile of a standing man" in the long vertical line of the letter <span style="font-style:italic;">elif (TYS</span>, 17). <span style="font-style:italic;">Fe</span> is "a man looking down in a sitting position, [while] <span style="font-style:italic;">vav</span> resembles a man stretching his feet" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 17). <span style="font-style:italic;">Ayın, kaf, he, mim, dal</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span> are similarly assimilated to expressive human bodily posture. One page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> provides a photograph of a framed inscription, or <span style="font-style:italic;">levha</span>, which reads "Ah mine'l aşk ve halâtihi / Ahraka kalbî bi hararatihi" ("Woe upon love and its states / Burns my heart with its heat").<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In and through the pictorial qualities of Turkish Islamic script, Baltacıoğlu reads what we might call either illuminations or ideograms of Arabic: <span style="font-style:italic;">Ah</span>, an exclamation of grief and longing, is embodied by the letters <span style="font-style:italic;">elif</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span>, the former resembling a standing man, the latter the head of a person weeping (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 18-19).</p>
<p>We should note that this alphabetic pictography neither represents nor replicates purportedly actual forms of the human body. Nor, however, is it entirely emptied of all representational function (or pretense to such function)—as are, for example, the contrasting, "geometrically abstract" Latin letters (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 17). "[This writing] is not a naturalist [<span style="font-style:italic;">naturalist</span>], realist [<span style="font-style:italic;">realist</span>] picture but a surrealist [<span style="font-style:italic;">sürrealist</span>] one," Baltacıoğlu observes. "Like the humans in Picasso's paintings, these letter forms are at once inside and outside nature. The letters and the human forms are not exact replicas  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of each other; they only share a resemblance … Turkish artists were the originators of surrealism [<span style="font-style:italic;">sürrealizm</span>] in writing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 26). Congruent with the goals of the European art practices of cubism and surrealism, for Baltacıoğlu Turkish Islamic writing provides what we might think as non-mimetic representations. And it is precisely this, I want to argue, that makes <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> an unthought or undiscussed kind of record of comparative literary modernity <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> methodology.</p>
<p>Contrasting non-mimetically "human" Turkish Islamic writing with the abstract geometry of Latin letters, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> poses the problem of a mechanized writing and a disenchanted language, in writing emptied of content and transformed into algebraic form.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> If the goal of the alphabet reform was to rationalize writing, establishing a purely arbitrary, abstract relation between meaning and written sign, it was certainly a success. And while such abstraction is arguably an immanent property of all writing systems, the sudden conversion to a new alphabet, I want to argue, created an acutely conscious experience of the gap between the signifier and the signified, and the visual and the aural. The "surreality," in this sense, of Turkish Islamic writing is its writing through and beyond the realm of appearance, past or beneath the geometrically flat plane of Latin orthography. For Baltacıoğlu, Turkish script arts give us surreal representations of "human language," of the human <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> language—surreality in letter and in world being constituted as remote formal resemblance, rather than pictographic mimesis.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the conservative drive in Baltacıoğlu's project, its movement "backward," seeking to preserve a writing through and below the realm of appearance, where it may be at one with the world itself. At the same time, in Baltacıoğlu's comparative invocation of European surrealist art practice, we see the drive to reconcile what he understood as the unified writing of the past with the modern present. In this, we could say, Baltacıoğlu makes a paradoxical movement from modernity forward into tradition, rather than a regression backward or "recovery" of tradition.</p>
<p>This was a singular gesture. As Duygu Köksal has noted, the single-party system in republican Turkey promoted in the 1930s and 1940s a national art "born out of the realistic representation of the nation-people in their ways of life and tastes, of the national landscape, as well as of the Republican reforms."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Some leading Turkish artists and poets did turn to European modernist trends as an alternative: the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet Ran, for example, adds a brief but important chapter to the history of Russian futurism, and the members of the "d Group" founded by Nurullah Berk, Abidin Dino, and Cemal Tollu (among others) in 1933 introduced post-impressionist techniques to Turkish painting. (The journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Ar</span>, published by the "d Group," set out to theorize a conceptual art inappropriable for nationalist propaganda.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Like others in the Turkish avant-garde, Baltacıoğlu had affirmed surrealism and cubism as important movements in his writings since the early 1930s.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Where the members of "d Group" were absorbed by the national cultural establishment by the 1940s, however, Baltacıoğlu's traditionalist avant-gardism retained its marginality.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Doubtless, this was partly due to Baltacıoğlu's freer interpretation of these movements' potential  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> legacies. Using the terms and categories "cubism" and "surrealism" interchangeably, 53 the third chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> contains a brief historical account of their emergence, with praise for their liberation of art from subservience to nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 21). But Baltacıoğlu did not himself go seeking a break with nature that would be absolute; in his reading, it was Picasso and Juan Gris, rather than Albert Gleizes, who pointed in the correct direction, refusing either to imitate nature <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> to completely break with it (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 24). Picasso's cubist "disration" of human form is read not as anti-humanist, but rather as resituating the human at the center of art (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 22).</p>
<p>One may certainly take issue with this distortive gesture (as well as to Baltacıoğlu's conflation of cubism with surrealism), but the role it plays in Baltacıoğlu's work, I want to argue, is something of a purposeful misunderstanding. <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> deploys surrealism in an attempt to reconcile traditional art practice with modernist aesthetics, and this is precisely the point where Baltacıoğlu leaves the Turkish avant-garde proper behind. Baltacıoğlu is not out to cultivate or reproduce a European trend in the Turkish scene, and so he re-describes surrealism as a metaphysics <span style="font-style:italic;">inherent</span> in Turkish Islamic writing.</p>
<p>One of Baltacıoğlu's motives here was to counterpose an aesthetic of Turkish Islamic writing to European Orientalist art historians (in particular, Louis Hourticq) who had characterized Islamic arts as resistant to pictorial representation (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 21-22). For Baltacıoğlu, the surrealist aesthetic constructed by twentieth-century Europeans is only a repetition of "[t]he Turkish art genius," which "has at all times manifested … a surrealist genius" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 25). Turkey, he claims, is the true originator of the surrealist aesthetic in art, architecture, and theater (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 25). If this rather preposterous claim risks merely <span style="font-style:italic;">reversing</span> the terms of traditionally hierarchical comparison, it's also true that the reversal, like the affiliation by which it is mediated, is obviously highly unstable, and it is this instability that I want to emphasize here.</p>
<p>What is valuable in surrealism for <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı?</span> The surrealists explored alternative modes of seeing at a time when classical models of vision had collapsed—when visual experience had assumed "an unprecedented mobility and exchangeability, abstracted from any founding site or referent" with the "final dissolution of a transcendent foundation for vision."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Against modernity's new disciplinary technologies, which sought to normalize this "liberated" subjective vision, the surrealist commitment to represent the subjective world opens a plane of the real beyond or "above" objective materiality, transparency, and instrumental abstraction. The phrases which knock at André Breton's window in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifeste du surréalisme</span> of 1924, and the swinging or half-open doors of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nadja</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Vases communicants</span> find remote analogues, we might say, in Baltacıoğlu's gaze into a wavy sea reflecting "the playful face of a writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">celî</span> style smiling" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 37)<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet where for Breton the surreal is marked by childlike or mad freedom "exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern,"<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> for Baltacıoğlu it is marked by ethical human values: beauty, religiosity, sociability, helpfulness, love (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 23, 81). Where Breton theorizes the surreal as the reconciliation of dream and reality in the play of chance,<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Baltacıoğlu sees it as a modern manifestation of divine order. Finally, where Breton  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> at times vacillates between privileging the visual or writing as the more immediate manifestation of the (sur)real, Baltacıoğlu seeks a surreal pictography unifying all such discrete sensibilities.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> It is not the coincidence of Turkish script arts (and <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı)</span> with surrealism, then, but rather their "missed encounter," as Baltacıoğlu saw it, that is my interest here, because it shows us what is at stake in these forms of comparison. The surrealist exercise of juxtaposition, of placing distant realities in contact, is itself a re for a Europe <span style="font-style:italic;">torn</span> by the violence of modernity (of that to which surrealism itself attempts to answer)—not for Europe as the <span style="font-style:italic;">telos</span> of the modern, which a "Turkish surrealism" can only ever follow. Baltacıoğlu's surrealist alliance exposes both "Europe" and "Turkey" as heterogeneous sites of the crisis of the modern, shifting the ground of comparison, we might say, from hierarchy to crisis itself.</p>
<p>In an unpublished early essay from the late 1920s, "La <span style="font-style:italic;">'vieille taupe'</span> et le préfixe <span style="font-style:italic;">sur</span> dans les mots <span style="font-style:italic;">surhomme</span> et <span style="font-style:italic;">surréaliste</span>" ("The 'Old Mole' and the Prefix <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span> in the Words <span style="font-style:italic;">Surhomme</span> [Superman] and <span style="font-style:italic;">Surrealist</span>"), Georges Bataille critiques the "double tendency" of surrealism, which in his analysis, re-invests the low or base vulgarity of life—"the unconscious, sexuality, filthy language"—with higher values (the <span style="font-style:italic;">"spirit, surreal, absolute</span>, etc.").<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> For Bataille, surrealism was fundamentally a failed poetic revolution: the prefix <span style="font-style:italic;">sur-</span> in "surrealism" marks this attachment to lofty value, what Bataille calls the "Icarian flight" of bourgeois revolt. Bataille's critique of Breton can certainly be applied to Baltacıoğlu, whose search for the sur-real in sacred language is fundamentally a failure to confront the alienation of modernity directly. And yet as I have argued, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> makes fruitful reading not <span style="font-style:italic;">despite</span> but <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> it manifests the contradictions of modernity, in failing to resolve those contradictions. It is those contradictions, and the failure to resolve them, which nuance our genealogies of the modern.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, Baltacıoğlu's project to preserve the sacred language of the past appeals to explanatory <span style="font-style:italic;">devices</span> including those of modern media—his anatomy of alphabets making ample use of organized charts and diagrams, as well as photographs providing "evidence." Against Baltacıoğlu's intentions, we might say, such diagrams, which measure each letter by the "dot" of the calligrapher's pen point, reveal a mechanicity inherent in the writing of the past, and point to a remote kinship between Latin and "Turkish Islamic" writing, rather than their opposition (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 95, 96, 99).</p>
<p>At the same time, literalizing the anatomical metaphors of Turkish calligraphy, Baltacıoğlu gives us a taxonomy of human res corresponding to letters, in a way exposing the insurmountability of the gap between poetic and literal functions of language. Against its own intentions, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> demonstrates the impossibility of preserving a unified "sacred" language in the modern present.</p>
<p>For finally, Baltacıoğlu's chart of transvisualized letters has more to say about the abstraction and individualization of modernity than about the human sacrality of Turkish Islamic writing it purports to argue and illustrate. The chart flattens a unitary, divine language onto a two-dimensional grid, incarcerating each letter in an individual cell of the grid. Here, the round curves of the Turkish Islamic alphabet, which Baltacıoğlu counterposed to the linear geometry of Latin letters, vanish into the straight lines of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> grid. The chart's spacing is a visual metaphor for the epistemic violence of modernity and its reorganization of space through the new disciplinary technologies of school, army, and state.</p>

<p>What these drawings of emptied human forms expose, then, is finally not the "human nature" of Turkish Islamic writing, but the spectralization of writing dissociated from bodily presence. Here, writing is no longer the mark of a hand. The reformed way of writing, performed sitting at a desk Western-style, attenuates the somatic engagement of traditional writing, in which "[c]alligraphers sat on sofas or cushions with their right knee raised and with the paper resting against the knee, a position that kept the paper perpendicular to the calligrapher's line of sight."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The reproducibility of the printed text of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> itself, traveling as intended through modern space and time, only further attenuates the presence of its author. Surveying a variety of script styles by different calligraphers, Baltacıoğlu has emphasized the intermediate, mediating position of the body between writer and text in Turkish Islamic writing. But the very method  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of emphasis <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> withdraws the body from this intermediate position. At the end, we are left with a chart of emptied, nongendered, spectral bodies, not mediators so much as markers of the materiality of an arbitrary, formalized and standardized writing. The body, previously imbricated in the act of writing, is now externalized, its void re standing behind the letter as a mere shadow—its writing hands and arms missing (or closed in on itself), the body prepared for utilization in army and factory.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> As a kind of negative of the modern present, Baltacıoğlu's emptied interiorities trace the Turkish subject's <span style="font-style:italic;">disappearance</span> into the new writing, more than anything else.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> thus performs the failure of its own traditionalism. At the same time, the essay performs the historical failure of the language reforms, after a brief and "catastrophic success,"<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> to abolish Turkish Islamic writing entirely: uncannily, the letters of the old alphabet come to life again here, more surreal than real. For Baltacıoğlu, the anatomy of each letter is an index to its character and destiny (<span style="font-style:italic;">alınyazısı</span>) (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 31). Letters can be "tense," "shy," or "brave" , social or anti-social . A letter "becomes a man" when it relates proportionately to adjacent letters, forming a society ; disproportionate relations, Baltacıoğlu suggests, produce anarchy . These anthropomorphized letters violate modernity's ontological distinction between human and nonhuman, animate and inanimate, poetic and literal, leaving us with the specifically doubled form of undecidability that Freud called the uncanny. Like the dead come to life, the abolished script of the past returns with new spells.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Literary Modernity</h1>
<p>If the critical discourses of modernism and modern (national) literature are useful for reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, neither can provide us with capacious enough a ground of comparison, I have argued, for Baltacıoğlu's singular encounter with surrealism. The broader re of literary modernity, on the other hand, in its powers of reference to simultaneously entwined and disparate histories of literatures between and within it, combines a sensitivity to internal difference with a complementary sensitivity to external relation, and gives us something of what is valuable in the new "transnational modernist studies." No universal content can be assigned to the term or concept "modernity," which is appropriated and used toward for many different goals.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> (The differences in Baltacıoğlu and Breton's political orientations are proof of that.)</p>
<p>"Literary modernity" gives us the breadth needed to link the linguistic/literary and the socio-economic domains without reducing or subordinating one domain to the other. In one way or another, we can say, much literary historiography tends to reproduce the distinction between "modernity" as economic, political, and technological change and "modernism" at large as the reflection of that change (affirmatively or negatively) in the arts. This conventional distinction confines the question of representational language to the domain of autonomous <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> history, where modernist experimentation at large can be explained as revolt, for example, against literary realism or romanticism. It can be very difficult to break with this way of limiting the question. Yet modernity is not only the generalization of the commodity form, but a generalization of language itself.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> While as Paul de Man argued in "Literary History and Literary Modernity," abstraction is an immanent property of language, one might say that the diverse technologies of capitalist modernity intensify its immanence, or lend it intensified significance.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In the case of the Turkish language reforms, change at the broader economic, political, and technological level cannot merely be said to be "reflected" in literature, since it transforms <span style="font-style:italic;">the very medium in which literature is created.</span></p>
<p>Literary modernity is defined by the desire to break away from oneself, spatially and temporally: "to wipe out whatever came earlier, in the hope of reaching at last a point that could be called a true present, a point of origin that marks a new departure."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Within Baltacıoğlu's missed encounter with European surrealism, we might contemplate an historical space within which the boundary between modern Turkish literature and European modernism begins to break down. Often taken to signify rigid and irreconcilable cultural difference, that boundary may already be more permeable than one wants to admit.</p>

Prior to and during his appointment as professor of Islamic Aesthetics <span style="font-style:italic;">(İslam Bediiyati)</span> at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun</span> between 1925 and 1933, Baltacioğlu had sponsored the collection and preservation of Islamic arts documents and artifacts. The eventual establishment of a department of History of Turkish Islamic Arts in 1949, in the newly opened Divinity School at Ankara University, proved to Baltacioğlu that these earlier efforts had not gone to waste (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 86). The postwar period of "Multi-Party Politics" in Turkey was characterized by a relative easing of the official secularist agenda of the earlier period, and the final publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazι Sanati</span> may certainly be understood in that context.</p></div>

Köksal carefully emphasizes the particulars of this Turkish scene even in its reception of European currents. With the notable exception of Nâzim Hikmet, the Kemalist regime generally tolerated "imports" of European aesthetic trends, since it ft the agenda for cultural modernization. "By the time its members began to enter the cadres of the Fine Arts Academy towards the 1940s," she writes, "the D Group had become part of the cultural establishment in Republican Turkey" ("Art and Power," 104). See Sibel Bozdoğan, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and Nation Building:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Turkish Architectural Culture in the Early Republic</span> (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2001), esp. 148-152 for a similar assessment of European-style avant-gardism in Turkey.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f25" href="#f25-text">25. </a>Baltacioğlu's comparison of Turkish Islamic arts with cubism may be traced back to his earlier articles "Mimaride Kübizm ve Türk Ananesi" ("Cubism in Architecture and the Turkish Tradition"), <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun Ilahiyat Fakültesi Mecmuasi</span> 3, no. 11 (April 1929): 110-131, and "Resimde Kübizm ve Türk Ananesi" ("Cubism in Painting and Turkish Tradition"), <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun İlahiyat Fakültesi Mecmuasi</span> 5, no. 19 (March 1931): 33-48, as well as his 1931 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span> ("Democracy and Art") (Istanbul: Kanaat Kütüphanesi, 1931). In these early writings, Baltacioğlu uses the term "cubism" primarily to describe the non-mimetic art of Picasso, Gris, and others. As he writes in the dedication to <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span>, Baltacioğlu's goal here is to reconcile "'Lyricism and Machinism'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Lirizm ve Mas¸inizm</span>). Cubism, for Baltacioğlu, embodies the reconciliation of these two value-systems, in the creative art of contemporary democracies—originating not from the exterior world of nature, but from human consciousness, and standing for modern individualism (<span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi</span> 125-126). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span>, Baltacioğlu aims explicitly to internationalize what he regards as a national culture (142-144). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanati,</span> on the other hand, one sees a more distinct opposition between the forces of rationalization and modern subjectivity (and the framework itself is explicitly national).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f26" href="#f26-text">26. </a>Islamic calligraphy became an important source of inspiration for postwar abstract Turkish painting in the 1950s. Note, however, that Baltacioğlu had been a leading proponent of this position since the early 1930s—though in many ways, his "licentious" argument concerning the invention of surrealism by Turkish calligraphers only reinforced his marginality. On postwar abstract art, see Adnan Turani, "Post-Second World War Trends in Turkish Painting," <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Turkish Painting</span>, ed. Renda Gürsel et al.

This group, which included Ece Ayhan, İlhan Berk, Edip Cansever, Sezai Karakoç, and Cemal Süreya, among others, truly did revolutionize Turkish poetry.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>By way of documenting this spectralizing reality, Baltacioğlu provides photographs of numerous calligraphic plates, making use of a medium unrivaled in its positive representational capacity.

At the same time, in such non-mimetic transactions, the photographic medium itself is all the more linked to the "old" writing.</p></div>

<p>I have a problem with decoration. I try to avoid it in my life, my apartment, the way I dress, the walls of my office, even my written work. This essay is symptomatic only in that it includes no illustrations. Although I will discuss some objects, the essay is text-based rather than object-based; my examples will be taken entirely from descriptions of objects.</p>
<p>I discovered this fact about myself several years ago, in the process of moving out of an apartment. When my possessions had been boxed up and moved out, and I had cleaned the floors, countertops, and fixtures for the benefit of the new tenant and in order to recover the security deposit, I felt, almost for the first time, that the apartment had become a space that I wanted to live in, because it looked as though no one lived there. Something about the task of removing every trace of myself from the built environment strongly appealed to me. My purpose in these pages is to outline the history and components of this feeling.</p>
<p>One name for the feeling is forensic: the perfect crime. In Ray Bradbury's 1948 short story "The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl," the killer becomes obsessed with the possibility that he has left some clue at the crime scene, and forces himself, before making his getaway, to dust and polish every surface that he might have touched, "and he wiped all the utensils and the silver faucets and the mixing bowls, for now he had forgotten what he had touched and what he had not."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> This task is so involving that it leads him to go over the surfaces of things he could not possibly have touched, the paradigmatic instance of which is his attention to the wax fruit at the bottom of the bowl, which he knows he  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> could not have put his hand on ("I'm <span style="font-style:italic;">sure</span> I didn't touch <span style="font-style:italic;">them</span>" [502]) but picks up and polishes anyway. The tension in the story presumably derives from the killer's capacity for distraction: although the killer can forget his own self-interest, which requires him to flee the crime scene, the story's readers should never be allowed to forget. "Rush, get away, run, never come back, board a train, hail a taxi, get, go, run, walk, saunter, but get the blazes out of here!" . The crossing of the readers' motivation (to get the killer out of the house) with the killer's motivation (to clean the house) may be supposed to invest the ordinary act of cleaning with a tension that it would not otherwise have. But the story, in sympathy with the killer whose stream of consciousness it follows, also seems to forget that it's about murder rather than cleaning house: the killer never tells you very much about the victim or why he has been killed, and never develops an awareness of the possible consequences of being caught. Wishing for the killer's escape might be one way of sympathizing with him, but a better way, the story suggests, would be to share in his real excitement, to care about making things clean. The story finally acknowledges the seductiveness of cleaning, and readers who are naturally excited by clean surfaces may be best equipped to appreciate it. It expresses an implicit ideal: to pass over a surface without leaving behind any identifying mark.</p>
<p>Another name for this feeling is modernism. For his 1957 art show "Le vide," a show that exhibited no art objects, Yves Klein cleaned and whitewashed every surface in the Galerie Iris Clert in order to remove any visible or invisible traces of the other artists who had shown there; for opening night, Klein also arranged to have two uniformed guards prevent anyone from entering the building.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> What was left, according to Klein, after the remains of the other artists had been eliminated, and in the absence of any spectator, was himself, "the pure 'atmosphere' of the painter." This event is self-promoting, but it proceeds by way of self-effacement: Klein offers a neutral space, which he calls a "void," in place of a self. Or you could say that he offers both self-effacement and neutrality as specifically modernist fantasies. This void may presumably be identified with the one into which Klein throws himself like a daredevil—from a second-floor window, into the street—in his later photograph "The Leap into the Void" , an image of the artist's shamanic conjuration of himself in which Marjorie Welish discerns an attitude of "skepticism regarding his own act."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> The gallery show "Le vide" is self-parodic, but it is additionally directed outwards—at the other artists who had occupied the space, and at any artist who shares the modernist assumption that art wants to be pure. In this case, pure means purified: the space has to be cleansed of artist, artifact, and maybe spectator as well. Pure like the perfect crime, where the crime doesn't really matter and is finally supposed to disappear. The act of cleaning, for Klein and for the killer in "The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl," does not enhance or preserve the intrinsic qualities of things; instead, it strips, wears off, destroys their surfaces, kills. By the same token, one might call this a creative act, with the reservation that it does not create anything living. After all, Klein is an artist, as is Bradbury's killer: "Yes, it was an artistic conception" . In fact, the killer considers himself a sculptor specializing in "the sculpturing of clay from warmth to coldness." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This essay puts these two feelings, the forensic one and the aesthetic one, together. The argument proceeds by accumulating and juxtaposing examples, primarily from literary texts. In order to avoid getting lost in a sea of examples, I will outline the four parts of the argument here. Part 1 gives a selective history of the argument that the function of decoration is to conceal—and by concealing, paradoxically, to mark—instances of cruelty. This argument is given its strongest statement in Hermann Broch's aesthetic theory, which universalizes both decoration and cruelty. In part 2, I argue for an expansive, cosmological sense of decoration, finding support in literary examples that might appear to oppose decoration but actually necessitate it. This broad definition has its apotheosis in the work of William Morris, for whom wallpaper not only indicates a universal order but originally creates that order and continually acts to maintain it. Part 3 uses this broad definition to rework a conventional periodization in English studies in which modernist style emerges from the rejection of Victorian decoration. I argue that the distinction between decoration and its rejection, which is commonly used to periodize modernist style, relies on a sense of a strong relation between surface, self, and action shared by Victorians and moderns. In relating life to surface, the arguments of the pattern-designer William Morris and the architect Le Corbusier surprisingly coincide. In part 4, I ask what would happen if modernism succeeded in cleansing the world, and consider possible answers in tales by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Henry James.</p>

<p>The coarticulation of these two feelings is not new. Decoration in the sense of the elaboration of abstract surface patterns "for the pleasure of art, without seeking to convey any truth with it" is weakly associated with cruelty in a footnote to John Ruskin's 1859 lecture "The Two Paths":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>All ornamentation of that lower kind is pre-eminently the gift of cruel persons, of Indians, Saracens, Byzantinians, and is the delight of the worst and cruelest nations, Moorish, Indian, Chinese, South Sea Islanders, and so on… The fancy and delicacy of eye in interweaving lines and arranging colours—mere line and colour, observe, without natural form—seems to be somehow an inheritance of ignorance and cruelty, belonging to men as spots to the tiger or hues to the snake.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The association is weak in that Ruskin deliberately, even proudly, refuses to explain it: "I do not profess to account for this… I merely assert the fact." One would not have to seek far for an explanation. Ruskin has assigned "ornamentation of that lower kind" to one of the two paths of culture-making, the way of pleasure, along with everything that he doesn't value—brutality, abstraction, the nations and populations of Asia, Africa, and America—reserving the second path for truth, civilization, gentleness, nature, and imperial England. The chain of associations is further weakened by the incoherence of the examples: the comparison to tiger pelts and snakeskins not only fails to explain skill  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in the design and execution of handcrafts such as carpets and stained glass, but instead offers examples of things that are not decorations, not even products of civilization, but rather parts of the given world. Ornament is unnatural in that it is not truth-seeking, not modeled on "natural form," and, at the same time, highly naturalized in that its production is a biological inheritance rather than a learned behavior.</p>
<p>This association is repeated uncritically in Adolf Loos's important 1908 essay "Ornament and Crime": "The Papuan tattoos his skin, his boat, his oars, in short, everything he can get his hands on… The modern man who tattoos himself is a criminal or a degenerate."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Here, again, there is no attempt at explanation; unlike Ruskin, Loos does not even acknowledge the absence of one. Antonin Artaud, too, repeats this association in his theoretical writings on theater. In his description of Balinese theater, actors themselves, by performing gestures that are difficult or uncomfortable, and by wearing costumes that give their bodies non-humanoid shapes, take on the character of "animated hieroglyphs."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> The deformed shapes make visible a history of cruelty on the bodies of the actors. Unlike ordinary writing, the shapes are not arbitrary, and, precisely because of the violence of their production, they communicate across cultures to any audience without the need for translation: "No, these spiritual signs have a precise meaning which strikes us only intuitively but with enough violence to make useless any translation into logical discursive language." Interestingly, Artaud inverts the system of values that in other respects he receives uncritically, idealizing primitive cultures that are given to decorate every surface with which they come into contact, placing special value on the violent history of the imposition and reception of forms.</p>
<p>What could this association mean? For a familiar literary example of decoration as aestheticized cruelty, recall the station house covered with human heads in Joseph Conrad's 1903 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>You remember I told you I had been struck at a distance by certain attempts at ornamentation… They would have been even more impressive, those heads on stakes, if the faces had not been turned to the house… I want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in those heads being there. They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts, that there was something wanting in him—some small matter which, when the need arose, could not be found under his magnificent eloquence.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The heads, according to Marlow, represent a failure of "eloquence," meaning either a failure to accomplish violence through mere speaking, or the failure of speech to prevent violence, or to conceal it. In any case, this example appears to follow the paradigm of Ruskin's two paths by limiting the failure to the outermost edge of the civilized world, the last station house at the furthest interior of the continent. Presiding at the station house is a character called simply "the woman." This name emphasizes her singularity; in the community of the novel, she is the only woman in Africa. This heightened allegorical pressure makes her body a magnet for "barbarous ornaments," "brass leggings," "brass wire gauntlets," "innumerable necklaces," "bizarre things," "charms" . Decoration becomes visible here—that is to say, it is identified as "attempts,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> successful or not, "at ornamentation"—in places that concentrate negative cultural values. The modifier "barbarous" is almost redundant for "ornament."</p>
<p>On the other hand, it might be argued that the novel distributes "attempts at ornamentation" evenly across civilizations, in that the singularity of the woman is finally superceded by the appearance of Kurtz's fiancée, and the setting of the station house by a papered and carpeted drawing room, which turns out to be the true "heart" of the colonial project. It would probably be more accurate to say that decoration acts as a conduit transporting misogyny to other sites.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The decorations in the fiancée's drawing room—including nonstructural "luminous and bedraped columns," "bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture," and a piano "like a sombre and polished sarcophagus"—are apparently designed to distract from her role in the horrors of colonialism. In conversation with Marlow, her name, which like the woman's is not represented directly, is substituted for those horrors: "the last word he pronounced was—your name" . (Consider the possibility that Marlow is telling the truth; her name is, literally, "Horror.") The drawing room at the end of the novel is mirrored at the beginning by "a room that looked soothingly just as you would expect a lady's drawing-room to look" , where Marlow has tea with an aunt who pulls strings to get him a job commanding a steamboat on the "big river." If decoration crosses civilizations, it does so only to reinforce a logic of association linking women, decoration, and cruelty, so that women are somehow located both behind colonialism, as the designers who set it in motion, and in front of it, as the final recipients and bearers of the riches of conquered nations. At one point Marlowe makes this link explicit: "at the other end of the affair" is a "knitting old woman with a cat" . In other words, both ends are occupied by the same re, who is simultaneously the most highly cultivated (decadent) and most primitive (barbaric).</p>
<p>Now consider an example from Victorian culture that has obvious practical applications, Sarah Winchester's Llanda Villa in San Jose, California. In 1881, Winchester inherited a controlling interest in the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. A medium advised her that the spirits of the American Indians killed by Winchester rifles would avenge themselves on her unless she found a way to accommodate them in her house. The decorative element in Winchester's house is famously excessive—in addition to spider web and daisy motifs that appear in stained glass windows and repeat in wallpaper and on moldings, even normally functional architectural elements turn out to be decorative, such as doors that open (not, as some commentators would have it, into nothing, which is impossible, but) into walls, and staircases that go (not nowhere, but) into ceilings.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> The uncanny motifs in Winchester's home design are a form of aestheticized cruelty; the unnecessary prolongation of the construction of the house—which in modernism will occur as the aestheticization of process, so that the art object retains traces of the act of making—is traditionally interpreted as a technique of distraction or concealment. The spirits of the Indians will be scared off by the incessant noise of construction, or trapped in the impossible space between a door and the wall it opens into. Or Winchester herself will be distracted by the process of construction or its uncanny traces in the house. John Ashbery, in one of the few critical accounts of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Llanda Villa, remarks that the traditional interpretation condescends both to Winchester and to the Indians to whom her work is addressed: "Surely the spirits weren't all that dumb, however, and Sarah, who by all accounts was a sensitive and cultivated person, fluent in four languages, must have known this" . Ashbery insists that Winchester is an artist taking inspiration from the circumstances of her own life. The project of unending construction is seriously, not blindly, conceived to process the dubious legacy of the Winchester rifle.</p>
<p>Hermann Broch gives the same association a much stronger formulation, as reasoned argument—precisely as the result of a series of rational choices—in the introduction to his 1947 monograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hugo von Hofmannsthal and His Time</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In order to attain a full enjoyment of life, either one must transre what is horrible into beauty—like the Romans with their gladiator games, like a Nero or a Borgia—or one must keep one's eyes shut in the face of ugliness and cruelty, and distinguish the beautiful so that it becomes an aesthetic "elect" and makes possible undisturbed pleasure. Yet whether it is one or the other, whether the affirmation of cruelty or its negation, despite the rationalistic demand for the unadorned, it is a question of an aesthetic overadornment of the ugly, of its hypertrophy or oversweetening. It is a question of denial concealed by "decoration."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Broch places Hofmannsthal in a terrible double bind: if he represents cruelty directly and accurately, he aestheticizes it; if he does not, he uses the aesthetic to replace it or distract from it; and in either case his art is a form of decoration. This account retains the one useful element in Ruskin, whereby decoration acts as an externalized memory, a continuous historical record of interactions between the given and the made, paradoxically marking the violent imposition of form by covering it. (The logical extension of this process would be a historian's dream: an artifact or space whose complete history is perfectly visible and legible everywhere, or in any context to which it can be transported, like Artaud's gestural hieroglyphs.)<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The strength of this account, as opposed to Ruskin's, is that it is fully symmetrical. Here cruelty is a given both in primitive and modern civilizations. Decoration is not a given, but it is an unavoidable effect of the act of making.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">2. Victorian wallpaper</h1>
<p>Unlike Ruskin, Loos, and Conrad, Broch assumes the broadest possible definition of decoration as <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> surface and depth, large and small, masculine and feminine, civilization and nature. "Ornament," he writes, is "the musical expression of the breed and of the spirit of <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> art, quintessence of culture, symbol of life, clearer and terser than all reason" . In this regard, he follows Alois Riegl, whose foundational 1893 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Style</span> (usually known by its German title <span style="font-style:italic;">Stilfragen</span>) defends and pursues a method of identifying period styles that develop without improvement or decay. Riegl absolutely rejects the possibility of a decadent style. In his account, decoration is the primary, universal act of civilizing: "It is the urge to decorate that is one of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> most elementary of human drives, more elementary in fact than the need to protect the body."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Broch may be responding indirectly to Riegl in reserving his harshest criticism not for decadence or style as style, but for what he calls "non-style," the style that refuses to acknowledge itself (51–59)—which in his other writing on aesthetics he calls kitsch, "the radical evil in the value-system of art."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> For similar reasons, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sense of Order</span> , Ernst Gombrich refuses the superfine distinctions that commentators sometimes make between decoration, ornament, and cosmetics. Etymologically, they mean the same thing; the deployment of a pattern, the placement of a flower in a buttonhole, the arrangement of a group of flowers or rocks, and the application of color to a surface all have the function of organizing a universe. Distinctions of medium, scale, and technique are significant, but not for the purposes of defining the subject, which for Gombrich boils down to the cognitively penetrated act of perceiving order. "In contrast to any stimulus-response theory I would wish to point to the need to regard the organism as an active agent reaching out towards the environment, not blindly and at random, but guided by its inbuilt sense of order."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> For example, the repeated Latin tag in Pound's <span style="font-style:italic;">Pisan Cantos</span> "aram nemus vult [the grove wants an altar]" is an expression of decoration in the deep sense of decorum: the grove wishes for an altar as an accessory, the continuation and endpoint of lines and surfaces already present in the grove.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> The same decorum operates in the following complaint from David Shapiro's poetic sequence "The Lost Golf Ball": "Part of the universe is missing. Missing!"<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The placement of the golf ball would not describe a pattern and in fact is not even alluded to except in the title of the sequence, but it is a decorative element that would act as a kind of world-navel, composing the pieces of its environment.</p>
<p>One of Gombrich's examples will help to demonstrate the advantages of this very broad definition. It may be tempting to read the following dialogue from Charles Dickens's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Hard Times</span> as a rejection of decoration in the name of rationalism:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"I'll explain to you, then," said the gentleman, after a dismal pause, "why you wouldn't paper a room with representations of horses. Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality—in fact? Do you?"</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"So you would carpet your room—or your husband's room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband—with representations of flowers, would you," said the gentleman.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers," said the girl.</p>
<p>"And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over them with heavy boots?"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't hurt them, sir. They wouldn't crush and wither if you please, sir. They would be pictures of what was pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy —"</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, ay! But you mustn't fancy," cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his point.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gombrich actually offers the utilitarian school-inspector as an instance of a rationalist theory of decoration favoring abstract patterns that, as William Morris puts it, "suggest" rather than "imitate… natural forms."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The school-inspector is iconoclastic, anti-illusionistic. He doesn't want the wallpaper to make false statements about the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> wall—that it opens out, that there is something on it or behind it, that it is anything other than a wall. He does not want to replace the wall with an image, or to use the wall as a frame for images. But he does not imagine a room with bare walls. The subject of wallpaper, for him, is governed by an obscure necessity: he tells the pupil who tries to evade the question (by suggesting that the room could be painted rather than papered) that "you <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> paper it." His account opposes two kinds of decoration, which are expressions of two mental operations, reason and fancy.</p>
<p>In assuming that wallpaper is necessary, and that it acts as a screen on which images of mental operations are projected, the school-inspector is completely typical. It would be easy to assemble an anthology of similar episodes in Victorian literature: Pip in <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Expectations</span> keeping himself awake in his room at the Hummums by concentrating on an Argus-like pattern of "eyes on the wall" made by the night-light; Lucy Robarts in <span style="font-style:italic;">Framley Parsonage</span> noting the ornament on which her lover was standing when he proposed to her ("Here, standing here, on this very spot—on that flower of the carpet—he begged me a dozen times to be his wife. I wonder whether you and Mark would let me cut it out and keep it") so that she can place it in her scrapbook; and her persevering lover, magnetically drawn to the same flower when he proposes to her on a later occasion ("Yes; he was standing on the exact spot where he had stood before"); John Ruskin, in his childhood, not given any toys to play with by his utilitarian, anti-illusionistic parents, making a game out of tracing the pattern in the carpet with his eyes or his feet ("the carpet, and what patterns I could find in bed covers, dresses, or wall-papers to be examined, were my chief resources"); as well as the "re in the carpet" that Henry James uses to diagram a literary career.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Or consider the character in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's story "The Yellow Wallpaper" , "creeping" around the old nursery in which she has been confined by an uncurious doctor and unsympathetic life-partner, slowly rubbing or as she says "smooching" and peeling off the "torturing" yellow paper, yet jealous of anyone other than herself who comes into contact with the paper.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> No one would claim that "The Yellow Wallpaper" is an attempt to imagine opposition to decoration, because the wallpaper is clearly used as an allegory or at least a symptom of a structural asymmetry.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Even if (deliberately forgetting everything we know about Gilman's project) this were a story not about gender roles but strictly about its explicit subject—wallpaper—it still would not be against wallpaper. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hard Times</span>, Gilman's character prefers one kind of decoration to another, and does not oppose decoration in principle. Stripping the wall is not a purist impulse (to expose the wall), but rather a first step toward redecoration, "repapering" . The character wants to replace the yellow paper with another pattern, such as the "pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings" downstairs , that will focus her mind effectively and allow her to work. "Work," Gilman rhapsodizes in a later statement, "the normal life of every human being; work, in which is joy and growth and service, without which one is a pauper and a parasite."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Gilman's character shares with Dickens's school-inspector the assumption that wallpaper is always mental wallpaper, an expression of a special relationship between the mind and the built environment. The characters differ in their interpretation of this relationship. For Gilman's character,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> wallpaper forms or trains the mind. The color of the paper in the nursery is "a constant irritant to a normal mind" , which means that the mind can't function normally in an environment colored by this paper. For Dickens's school-inspector, the mind forms the pattern on the wall. Wallpaper that creates an illusion of space (such as horses trotting up and down the wall) is a projection of "fancy," an image-producing faculty; wallpaper that establishes a boundary, reinforcing what the wall already does in space, is a projection of reason.</p>
<p>These assumptions occur as propositions in William Morris's 1882 lecture "Some Hints on Pattern-Designing." Morris formulates the propositions in response to a question that he asks somewhat grudgingly: "We may as well ask ourselves what reason or right this so-called ornamental art has to existence?"<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> His answer is that decoration is not opposed to reason, but coextensive with it:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Doubtless there will be some, in these days at least, who will say, "'Tis most helpful to me to let the bare walls alone." So also there would be some who, when asked with what manner of books they will furnish their room, would answer, "With none." But I think you will agree with me in thinking that both of these people would be in an unhealthy state of mind, and probably of body also; in which case we need not trouble ourselves about their whims, since it is with healthy and sane people only that art has dealings.</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, wallpaper is a cause of mental health (wallpaper forms mind, as in "The Yellow Wallpaper") as well as its symptom (mind forms wallpaper, as in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hard Times</span>). The modality of the school-inspector's injunction "you <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> paper it" has shifted slightly; Morris says only that you <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> paper it. You can have bare walls if you choose—at the cost of your health, sanity, and your seat in his audience. Here wallpaper is not strictly necessary; Morris admits that there are forces in the universe acting against it, and recognizes them as irrational.</p>
<p>In another lecture, "Of the Origins of Ornamental Art" , Morris imagines a civilization that includes technology but not decoration, where a useful household object such as "the cup" takes "its first convenient form" and all things are made "without reference to anything but their first obvious use."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> He argues for the historical possibility of such a civilization, and even admits that it could include art ("music and poetry"), representation ("pictured images"), and history ("knowledge of what is and what has been"). But it could not include reason. The organizing interaction between the given and the built environment that occurs in decorative patterns is not only evidence of, but is also the origin of, the rational: "This then was the birth of popular or ornamental art, the birth of man's intelligence" ("Origins," 139). That's why you can forfeit decoration only if you are willing to sacrifice your sanity too: because decoration and rational thought are coextensive. The near-tautology of an expression such as "I think you will agree with me in thinking" is revealing: if you are thinking, then you will agree with Morris, who is also thinking. In these lectures, bare walls take on the character of the excluded middle in Aristotle; you can't even argue with someone who prefers bare walls or affirms the excluded middle. Wallpaper is axiomatic: it defines a space in which rational thought can occur and outside of which rational discourse  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> is impossible. When Morris asks grudgingly whether wallpaper has "a reason or right to existence," it is the wrong question. The only rational question is: what kind of wallpaper do you want?</p>
<p>The kind that Morris wants would cover every visible surface completely. In all his writing on design, he argues vehemently against the introduction of empty space. His most extreme statement of the ideal of total coverage appears in a manifesto for book design, "His Aims in Founding the Kelmscott Press" :</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Now, as to the spacing: First, the "face" of the letter should be as nearly coterminous with the "body" as possible, so as to avoid undue whites between the letters. Next, the lateral spaces between the words should be (a) no more than is necessary to distinguish clearly the division into words, and (b) should be as nearly equal as possible. Modern printers, even the best, pay very little attention to these two essentials of seemly composition, and the inferior ones run riot in licentious spacing… Third, the white between the lines should not be excessive; the modern practice of "leading" should be used as little as possible, and never without some definite reason.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The "essentials of seemly composition" amount to a refusal or distrust of unmarked space. The compositor's decisions are directed toward reducing the spaces between letters, words, lines, and paragraphs, so that there will be as little room as possible for the elemental surface of the page to assert itself.</p>
<p>The expressions Morris uses to characterize the alternative, such as "excessive" and "licentious," which may seem disproportionately strong for a discussion of page layout, recur in later descriptions of the productions of the Kelmscott Press. Jerome McGann's is typical:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Borders [in the Kelmscott Press <span style="font-style:italic;">Earthly Paradise</span>] between decorative materials and linguistic text are established only to be overrun everywhere. One observes in particular the ornamental work surrounding the boxed title and author-line on the verso and the heavily decorated margin at the recto. In each case the leafwork defined at the margins has moved into bibliographical spaces normally occupied by typeface alone.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Morris and McGann are clearly describing the same thing, using the same vocabulary. Vines climbing the margins, dingbats and squirly-gigs dividing one word from another, wood-block illustrations crowding the text against the margin, and other visual languages that do not convey meaning but are simply, or, rather, complexly, decorative, compete with the lines of type that they frame; meanwhile, the type, instead of effacing itself in order to concentrate attention on the thematic content, demands attention as an aesthetic object in its own right. However, between Morris and McGann, the valences of the terms have been reversed. For Morris, empty space "runs riot"; for McGann, decorative borders "overrun." For Morris, the array of graphic interventions makes the page more "seemly" and "legible"; for McGann, they are excessive ("heavily decorated") and serve as obstacles to reading: "Kelmscott books are hard to read."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Morris implicitly distrusts definite boundaries and explicitly refuses empty space, even to the point of illegibility. For him, any unmarked space is automatically licentious, because, for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> one thing, it provides evidence of licentiousness: if the spaces between letters, words, or lines become noticeable, that can only be because the printer has been inattentive ("modern printers pay very little attention"), lazy, and has not performed the duty of the printer, which is to cover the page with marks. And readers encounter empty space as an invitation to licentiousness: no marks, no paths, nothing to occupy the mind.</p>
<p>Morris's distrust of empty space is related to his troublesome notion of leisure, a key problem for his advocacy of socialism. The intellectual historian Ruth Kinna elegantly summarizes two contradictory accounts of leisure in Morris's thought: "In the first he contrasted work with leisure and suggested that attractive labor required the reduction of necessary labor time; in the second he identified work with leisure and defined attractive labor as the exercise and expression of human creativity."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Morris can imagine a space that isn't decoration, but he has trouble imagining an activity that isn't work in the strong sense of making. In "Of the Origins of Ornamental Art," leisure is a value that occurs second on a list of conditions for "beauty and happiness in the world" ("Origins," 155), but as a category of experience Morris is barely able to describe it, and it frequently threatens to become indistinguishable from work. This confusion persists in "Some Hints on Pattern-Designing," where he advocates interspersing one kind of work with another. Those who design patterns—which, he concedes, "is a very harassing business"—should be sure to "supplement" their primary work with a leisure activity, which turns out to mean "some distinctly executive work," in other words the manufacture of textiles. Otherwise, he says, the designers will have "a great tendency to go mad," or else "suffer terribly or become quite stupid" ("Hints," 279). The only conceivable alternative, leisure as negation (inaction and non-creation), would be fatal: "I tried to think what would happen to me if I were forbidden my ordinary daily work; and I knew I should die from despair and weariness."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> At this point, the concept of leisure as negation, which Morris is at pains to avoid, converges with the negative form of work, slavery, which he recognizes by its proximity to and overlap with death. In the condition of slavery, "the workers feared death… if they left their work," and under such compulsion, their products show no marks of "pleasure in life" through decorations ("Origins," 151). This, then, is the knot in Morris's socialism that Kinna exposes: leisure is either the same as work, in which case it simply means switching from one task to a different one (design rather than manufacture, or manufacture rather than design); or, if it isn't a kind of work, then it's death, which is also the same as forced labor!</p>
<p>For Morris, all space is working space. Wallpaper is an incitement to work (wallpaper forms body) as well as a product of work (body forms wallpaper). As Gombrich puts it, wallpaper is "habit-forming" : it forms habits and is formed by habit. Even when Morris calls wallpaper "the art whose office it was to give rest and pleasure to the toiling hand" ("Hints," 280), the rest and pleasure do not seem to take the form of an interruption of work; instead, they are qualities of work that result from wallpaper, whose function is to define a restful, pleasant environment where the worker's hand can continue toiling. Elsewhere Morris writes that the "first aim" of all ornamental art is "lightening the toil of man by giving him pleasure in his daily work" ("Origins," 150), again assuming that pleasure can only occur in work, and effectively leaving room for nothing else in life. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>But wallpaper doesn't just encourage work by creating a space for it. It also encourages a particular kind of work by example: it inspires the worker to continue the pattern, to produce more wallpaper. The completely marked space of wallpaper doesn't define a territory within which work is finished; it doesn't in any way discourage additional marking.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Or, if it resists further marking, that resistance can only be encouraging. When Morris notes that the production of wallpaper "can be done by a great many people without too much difficulty and with pleasure" ("Hints," 258), there is no tension between pleasure and difficulty; they may even be synonyms. "Without too much difficulty" imposes a limit beyond which work would cease, and also establishes a minimum without which work will not occur. Elsewhere he says explicitly that a certain level of difficulty is assumed and valued: "limitations are as far as possible from being hindrances to beauty in the several crafts. On the contrary, they are incitements and helps to its attainment" . In fact, this is his favorite theme: "The special limitations of the material should be a pleasure to you, not a hindrance" ("Textiles," 251). The worker is pleased and rested, incited and helped, so long as the working environment imposes some kind of physical resistance. Or, as Pound (quoting Yeats quoting Beardsley) puts it in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pisan Cantos</span>, "Beauty is difficult."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">3. Modernism against decoration</h1>
<p>Given this broad definition, what is opposed to decoration? This is a historical problem: if, following Riegl's work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Stilfragen</span>, epochs in history can be identified by characteristic period styles and motifs in the decorative surfaces of artifacts, then modernism appears to occur outside of history. The problem is also historiographical, since the rejection of decoration in modernist style coincides chronologically with the beginning of the study of art history as an academic discipline. In 1892, a year before the first publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stilfragen</span>, the American architect Louis Sullivan wrote that "it would be greatly for our aesthetic good if we should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a period of years so that our thought might concentrate acutely upon the production of buildings well formed and comely in the nude," in effect proposing an epoch, "a period of years," that art historians would be unable to describe.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> To make something without decorating, both in the limited sense (dingbats, squirly-gigs, buttonholes) and in the broad sense (imposing order on the world), becomes a <span style="font-style:italic;">project</span> for modernism. Limiting the definition of decoration is the first step in this project.</p>
<p>The strain of modernism that defines itself against decoration has been described adequately elsewhere, so I will mention examples from only a few different arts.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Ford Madox Ford rolled on the floor moaning in response to Ezra Pound's use of superliterary words such as "eglantine" and other "Victorian floppiness." Pound later wrote: "That roll saved me three years."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> (The three years are identical to the "three years, out of key with him time" that the persona dedicates to reviving poetry in "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley.") Charles Ives named the viola in his second string quartet "Rollo" so that he could scapegoat it as the decorative, effeminate, European element in American music: "Rollo was paid as a humorist by the weak but snappy management of a nice magazine,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> which hires grave decorators to sell uninteresting premises made interesting to the disinterested… Rollos—resting all their nice lives on, and now hiding behind, their silk skirts."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Coco Chanel based the design for the "little black dress" on a maid's uniform.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Frank Lloyd Wright's clients frequently complained that the houses he designed for them included no storage space for their clothes, no display space for their paintings and bibelots; Wright typically responded that they had to get rid of their stuff before occupying the house. "Mr. Wright, we notice that there are no closets in the house." "Closets are rotten. They just accumulate a lot of junk."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> This could be a motto for modernism: you must become a completely different person before you can enter my building. Less than a decade after the death of William Morris, Adolf Loos published "Ornament and Crime," in which he announced: "We have conquered ornament, we have won through to lack of ornamentation… Soon the streets of the town will glisten like white walls. Like Zion, the holy city, the metropolis of heaven."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Loos may not be an ideal representative re because his position is extreme, and his characteristic mode of expression is irony; and although he was prolific as a designer of objects and buildings and even more prolific as a commentator on design, few of his designs were realized. He was, however, a discernible influence on a generation of architects that included Wright, Le Corbusier, and Gropius. Le Corbusier is clearly thinking of "Ornament and Crime" in the closing pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Decorative Art of Today</span> , which envisions a utopia inaugurated by a decree requiring every citizen</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>… to replace his hangings, his damasks, his wall-papers, his stencils, with a plain coat of white Ripolin [whitewash]… <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything is shown as it is</span>. Then comes inner cleanness, for the course adopted leads to refusal to allow anything at all which is not correct, authorized, intended, desired, thought-out: no action before thought.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Le Corbusier's whitewash has no positive qualities. To put it bluntly, its whiteness is excremental: "When we eat, nature knows well how to rid us of what has served its purpose. Without the Law of Ripolin we accumulate, we make our houses into museums or temples" . Wallpaper is an instance of cultural retention: an accumulation of waste material, a residue of past actions that prevents the accomplishment of new intentions by creating a need for lesser acts of maintenance, "impure" memory—a category that includes any memory dependent on artifacts. As in Riegl, decorative motifs are historical markers, with the difference that the marking of history is no longer neutral, but actually limits human activity to unwanted curatorial duties: collection, preservation, and contemplation of the artifacts that make up the visible historical record. Le Corbusier's later treatise on visual measurement <span style="font-style:italic;">The Modulor</span>  is, if anything, more rabidly anti-preservationist: "Past decisions—customs—habits—all these stay with us through the most overwhelming events, disturbing, constricting, wantonly interfering with the free play of the mind."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Decorative Art of Today</span>, whitewash solves this problem by washing the city, emptying space, erasing history. Le Corbusier is at least practical enough to say that history will not end there. Not all surfaces will remain unmarked after receiving the Ripolin treatment; slowly, marks will accumulate. After the ritual of purification, nothing will be wasted; all marks will be "correct, authorized, intended, desired, thought-out." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In a sense, this idealization of empty space simply contradicts Morris's refusal to leave any surface unmarked. For Le Corbusier, non-functional, non-symbolic marks on the wall introduce a foreign, perhaps aleatory, and potentially uncontrollable element into the built environment; whereas for Morris, the absence of such marks indicates that one has not encountered sufficient resistance in the environment. Both designers actually agree on a basic assumption about the cognitive and physical effects of design: that architecture is destiny. The room determines what can take place in the room. They also agree on what appears to be a more eccentric assumption: that the shape of the room does not matter or is not as important as the decorations. The wall is a crucial expression of and enabling condition on whatever "work" (Morris) or "action" (Le Corbusier) is possible within the room, not because the wall defines the three-dimensional space in which these activities occur, not because the wall accommodates or fails to accommodate the human body, and not because it encloses the body, acting as a boundary between interior and exterior. These apparently definitive properties of the wall turn out to be accidental. The primary significance of the wall is its surface.</p>
<p>Since Morris calls himself a "decorator" or "pattern-designer," it is not surprising that he should want to attach significance to the surfaces of things.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> It is surprising that Le Corbusier, an architect, whose declared interest is in what he calls "constructions" or "structures" (so much so that during one period in his career he prefers the term "construction" to "architecture") should accord surfaces so much power. Because Le Corbusier is ostensibly concerned with structure, he rejects decoration as trivial: nothing should go on the wall that might interfere with the wall's assertion of its structure. But in granting decoration this demonic power to interfere with structure, to conceal bad structures, to suggest false structures, or to show that forces other than structure are at work in the built environment, he allows decoration to become not just trivial, but actively, dangerously trivial: something that could trivialize whatever it touches. The aphorism "Decoration always hides a mistake in construction," which he borrows from his teacher, Auguste Perret, means that decoration does not belong to the domain of construction but is nonetheless capable of injuring it.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> This threat to the integrity of structure can't be neutralized on the level of structure, but can only be answered on its own level, that of the surface, by applying "THE LAW OF RIPOLIN/ A COAT OF WHITEWASH"  over everything. Whitewash works according to the principle that Le Corbusier attributes to wallpaper: it goes on the surface, and it conceals a mistake underneath. If, as he says, decoration is instituted to conceal "a mistake in construction," then whitewash is yet another species of decoration, in this case concealing the mistake of wallpaper.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Le Corbusier seems not to recognize this limitation on the transformative capability of whitewash. Adolf Loos, his source, acknowledges the problem when he says that the unadorned streets of the modern city "will glisten like white walls. Like Zion, the holy city, the metropolis of heaven." The key term in this series, the one that he repeats, is "like," finally withholding the revelation of a heavenly city even as it points toward it. Loos's hyperbole—the conjunction of "white walls," which are possible to make, witness, and exemplify, with "metropolis of heaven," which is not, as well as the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> conjunction of "metropolis" with "heaven," implying uptown and downtown, old and new developments, sprawl, suburbs, in heaven—is insincere, which is only to say that it's hyperbole. Loos prefers "lack of ornament" to ornament, but he doesn't believe that the former is more natural or divine than the latter, or that it is more or less than a style, because lack of ornament is still a kind of design, and style is the domain in which design takes place. Design can reject decoration in favor of spontaneous organization, but not style, which it can only replace with other styles. That is why the working principle in Loos's series is resemblance rather than transcendence: the modern, unadorned city may look like heaven, but it isn't the same as heaven (unless, which he also implies, the metropolis of heaven is also a product of design, and therefore characterized by styles that change seasonally along with other fashions).</p>
<p>Le Corbusier inherits the emblem of the white wall from "Ornament and Crime," along with some other rhetorical res, but he doesn't inherit the ironic tone, doesn't even seem to possess a sense of irony. He really proposes whitewash as a non-style in which things can be apprehended directly: "Everything is shown as it is," a motto that might be amended, "except wallpaper, which is hidden." Because whitewash, no matter what its name suggests, doesn't wash anything; it works by layering rather than reduction. As Mark Wigley puts it, "Whitewash purifies the eye rather than the building."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> A layer of whitewash may stand for the removal of decoration, but instead of removing something, instead of paring away "accretions of dead things"  to expose an elemental surface underneath, it leaves all the layers intact and may even function as a protective cover.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">4. Cruelty concealed by decoration (II)</h1>
<p>How does modernism, in its concern for the elemental and primordial in all media, justify the rejection of decoration? For an answer, let's return to Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," which is still the smartest thing anyone has written on the subject:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind. The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.</p>
<p>You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in following, it turns a back-somersault and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples on you. It is like a bad dream.</p>
<p>The outside pattern is like a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions—why, that is something like it.</p>
<p>That is, sometimes!</p>
<p>There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.</p>
<p>When the sun shoots straight in through the east window—I always watch for the first long, straight ray—it changes so quickly that I can never quite believe it.</p>
<p>That is why I watch it always. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>By moonlight—the moon shines in all night when there is a moon—I wouldn't know it was the same paper.</p>
<p>At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, and worst of all, moonlight, it becomes bars!</p>
<div class="attrib">(12–13)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The outside pattern produces two cognitive effects that should be distinct, both defining a boundary and exceeding it. By day, the pattern is a fractal, toadstools growing out of toadstools, a site of movement, growth, change, and therefore a source of irritation ("an irritant"), distraction ("a bad dream") and violence ("it slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples on you"). By night, the same outside pattern "becomes bars," a site of stasis and order, the effect of which is imprisonment. These are the two contrary tendencies of decoration. If you allow a pattern to reproduce itself on the wall, it might escape your control, or it might impose its order on you.</p>
<p>What would happen if modernism succeeded in removing all decorations from space? The success of this project is the theme of Henry James's tale "The Jolly Corner," which complements "The Yellow Wallpaper" as an expression of hostility to Victorian design.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The character in the tale, Spencer Brydon, inherits a house in New York, the house where he was born and grew up, but doesn't want to do anything with the property—he won't live there, sell or rent it, or develop it by breaking it up into apartments or tearing it down and replacing it with an office building (as he does with other properties that he inherits at the same time). Instead, he hires a housekeeper, Mrs. Muldoon, to maintain it—unfurnished, undecorated, unlived-in—so that he can visit it "in the evil hours" late at night to glory in the atmosphere of immaculate emptiness.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Brydon has two "policies" in these visits . One is that it should be impossible for anyone outside the house to track his movements within it: residents at the hotel believe he is spending time at his club, members of the club believe he has returned to the hotel, no one watching from the street sees him in the house, and not even the police, represented by "the fat avenue officer," witness his entrances and exits (327–28). His other policy is to leave all the rooms "empty" , to open all the doors, "to keep vistas clear" , to merge the segmented spaces of the Victorian household. In effect, Brydon turns his childhood home into a hermetically sealed environment comparable to Klein's void.</p>
<p>From Klein we know that what remains in space, after every trace of one's activity has been carefully removed, is a kind of self-portrait. The character in Gilman confirms that stripping the wallpaper in her room would make manifest her spectral double on the other side of the wall. "The Jolly Corner" comes up with almost the same result: the house, a space of bare walls and floors, becomes the site for a "relation… unique in the experience of man" between Brydon and an alternate version of himself, the person he would have become if he had spent his life at home in New York, whom for the sake of clarity I will call Brydon2. James and Gilman even use the same name, "creeping"—in other words, being a creep—for the difficult task of stalking an unachieved possibility of oneself. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The difference is that in "The Yellow Wallpaper" the narrator and the double are the same person; the re behind the wallpaper reflects the situation of the character in the room. In "The Jolly Corner," on the other hand, the double is a separate person. Brydon2 is not a perfect mirror of Brydon1 in that he wears a pince-nez rather than a monocle, is missing two fingers, and stands erect while Brydon1 is prone, having fainted or, he later claims, died . The failure of portraiture—one of the Brydons is either a little more or less than the other—indicates the asymmetry of their separate histories. Brydon2 invents the skyscraper before Louis Sullivan: "If he had but stayed at home he would have anticipated the inventor of the sky-scraper" . Brydon1 invents a person, Brydon2, who is also "an erect confronting presence" , an "image erect" , "rigid and conscious" , and so on. The erection is either an externalized body part or a synecdoche for Brydon1's arousal; the content of the unique relation is the fantasy of sex with a version of oneself from the land of the dead, or a parallel universe. In fact, this unique relation may be the only form of relation possible in the tale. Otherwise, boundaries between persons either tend to collapse in shared "vibrations" between one sensitive soul and another—the other named characters in the story, Mrs. Muldoon and Alice Staverton, seem to have no trouble reading Brydon1's mind—or else communication radically fails in sentences that project over the heads of Brydon1's interlocutors at the hotel or club.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> Relation with something that isn't simply oneself occurs only across universes or across death, a form of seduction possible only in the immaculately clean, undecorated house. Like Bradbury, James acknowledges the attractions as well as the dangers of a perfectly clean space. A perfectly clean environment, free from the detritus of history, allows unprecedented, even unique, opportunities for reinvention. But such an environment could not support life, or even include evidence of life.</p>
<p>James calls the feeling that the environment includes no trace of one's presence a "unique relation" between versions of the self. Broch calls it cruelty. A more familiar name for the feeling might be empathy, a term whose usage bridges the aesthetic and the psychological: it is originally used to describe perceptual experiences of the plastic arts (a tall statue makes one feel tall, if only because one has to look up, craning one's neck, to perceive it entirely), and its meaning is later broadened to include the capacity for intersubjective feelings.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> The distinction between cruelty and empathy vanishes in the broad sense of decoration. If the architecture of surfaces finds its destiny in human actions, and if actions depend on surfaces regardless of whether the surface presents fullness or emptiness, then the empathy marked by interactions between giving and making, and the cruelty exposed by the retreat from these interactions, are positive and negative descriptions of the same feeling.</p>

Broch's monograph is a cultural maintenance project comparable to Auerbach's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mimesis</span> or Curtius's <span style="font-style:italic;">European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages</span>: an attempt to reclaim the materials of European civilization for German scholarship after the surpassing disaster of the second world war. The book takes the form of an anti-bildungsroman: how a talented, sensitive child grew up and became "a bad poet" because "out of weakness" he "succumbed too much to the conditions of his time" . For Broch, the power and danger of being modern is mobility. Hofmannsthal is admirable as long as he keeps moving, progressively mastering and renouncing the genres of lyric, prose narrative, grand opera, and mystical drama. When he stops moving and changing, he becomes responsible for the failures of the civilization that he has progressively assimilated.

My reading, like Kinna's, stresses the contradictions, but other readers have found compelling ways to make Morris's thought consistent. According to Stephen Arata, Morris's notion of leisure prescribes the particular form of inattention that he practiced as an artist, which allowed him to work simultaneously on several projects in different media: "What we find scandalous in Morris's method is precisely that he is not giving his full attention to the act of composition. He is weaving, and he is composing." "On Not Paying Attention," <span style="font-style:italic;">Victorian Studies</span> 46, no. 2 (Winter 2004): 193–205, 203. Elizabeth K. Helsinger finds a principle of "relief" operating in Morris's theoretical writing on the cognitive function of decoration. "Relief" is not an aesthetic principle in the ordinary sense, but rather a regulatory or prophylactic one; its function is to protect against the intense aesthetic experiences occasioned by beautiful or vulgar objects. "The lesser arts should provide relief from stirring emotions or beauty that claims too much attention, and relief also from the stresses of modern work and what later critics would call the shocks of modern life—its novelty, its speed, its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ugliness."

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f30" href="#f30-text">30. </a>Morris should therefore be distinguished from the project of "total design" against which Hal Foster inveighs in <span style="font-style:italic;">Design and Crime (and Other Diatribes)</span> (London: Verso, 2002). Morris aims at a decorative surface whose fullness does not imply perfection; only the kind of "useless toil" that he associates with slavery or death would not encourage more design. Foster is surely right to say that the "designed subject" is the "unintended offspring of the constructed subject" , giving a name and a genealogy to the worst contribution of poststructuralist theory, construction in the non-creative sense.</p></div>

The organicism or integrity of Wright's decorations depends on the intrinsic qualities of the materials; rather than hide the color and texture of the wall behind a pretty paper, he prefers to have abstract decorative motifs carved into or raised out of the surface, as though highlighting a pattern latent in the wall, although not easily visible prior to his intervention.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f43" href="#f43-text">43. </a>This essay is concerned with feelings about decoration, not with artifacts, but the inconsistencies between Le Corbusier's theory and practice are worth mentioning. As Mark Wigley and David  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Batchelor have shown, except in a few important buildings, such as the Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier 107 uses whitewash sparingly. Most of his buildings use several colors other than white on a single surface; moreover, the colors tend to be applied. Batchelor, <span style="font-style:italic;">Chromophobia</span> (London: Reaktion Books, 2000), 47; and Wigley, 16–23. Unlike Wright, Le Corbusier does not value the intrinsic qualities of materials. Late in his career, however, he gets interested in accidents that occur in the process of construction; rather than smoothing or covering irregularities or cracks that develop in poured concrete, he might instead choose to highlight them by painting a line over the cracks. See John Winter, "Le Corbusier's Technical Dilemma," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Open Hand: Essays on Le Corbusier</span>, ed. Russell Walden (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1977), 339–340; and André Wogenscky, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Corbusier's Hands</span>, trans. Martina Milla Bernad (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 76. Jencks also observes that Le Corbusier's architectural theories are not consistent with his domestic life with Yvonne Gallis, who tended to accumulate clutter in their apartment: "Le Corbusier placed a bidet, that beautifully sculptural 'object-type,' right next to their bed. She covered it with a tea-cosy" . This sort of compromise is to be expected in any household that includes more than one person.</p></div>

See "The Nervous Origins of the American Western," <span style="font-style:italic;">American Literature</span> 70, no. 2 : 293–316.

<p>"There can be, I believe, such a thing as a dominant art form," Clement Greenberg declares, in his 1940 manifesto, "Towards a Newer Laocoon," and "this," he adds, "was what literature had become in Europe by the 17<sup>th</sup> century."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> His declaration itself purports to herald the moment when, after a struggle, recent enough that its violence can still be sensed, "the arts lie safe now, each within its 'legitimate' boundaries" and the visual arts can be seen to have displaced literature from the dominant position. The tone of confidence in which Greenberg pronounces "painting" the victor in this long cultural war suggests that he himself is an old campaigner, although in fact this was not at all the case. The authority of the writing in "Laocoon" and its companionpiece of the previous year, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch," tends to make one forget that before these essays instantly established the thirty-year-old Greenberg as a force to be reckoned with in the American art world, he had published only one review and a couple of short stories. Moreover, while he had a certain talent for sketching and a belief that an interest in the visual arts was part of the equipment of a person of culture, Greenberg's ambitions up to that point had been focused on the world of literature. Above all, he wanted to be known as a poet. The prospect of the publication of "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" "irks me," he writes to a friend in early 1939, the worry being "that if once they get the idea into their heads that I'm a critic, they'll decide—they're like that—that I'm not a poet no matter how good my poetry may be."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> And yet, although he repeats this worry in subsequent letters over the course of the next year, by  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> year's end this never-to-be-published poet and soon-to-be-famous art critic will declare literature a thing of the past.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the present cultural moment, when the dominance of the image over the word goes virtually without question, Greenberg's rapid shift of allegiance from poetry to painting may seem hardly worth remarking on. In 1939, however, the choice required a breathtaking leap of imagination. "I'm trying to contain an excitement," Greenberg confessed to his friend shortly after expressing the worry that his criticism might overshadow his poetry. Having "borrowed paints from a girl," he has tried painting for the first time, and "the colors came just right, flowed smooth from my conceiving eye." The quasi-sexual pleasure Greenberg derives from this experience has peculiar implications for his sense of vocation. "[T]he instinct to draw is as deep in me as the instinct to fuck," he concludes, and "[w]hen I believe that, I believe I'm important and look at myself in the mirror with respect. Whereas with poetry—there's no instinct involved … It's all ambition and the need to create something detached and objective. Poetry is public. Drawing and fucking are private" . Heretofore Greenberg has associated "ambition," the urge to dominate, with "poetry," while "drawing," which we may take as shorthand for his investment in visual art in general, has seemed to him a merely "private" indulgence. Suddenly, however, he sees in "drawing" a means of establishing his importance: in other words, the impending publication of his first significant piece of writing suggests to him that he may dominate in the world of visual art as he could not in the world of poetry. Nonetheless, until the very moment when this career path opened up to him, Greenberg saw the way of poetry as the way of power.</p>
<p>"There can be such a thing as a dominant art form." In this essay, I will try to unpack this seemingly self-evident yet in some ways mysterious claim, to ask what significance the question of the relative order of dominance among the arts may have held for Greenberg and his readers in 1940, and what significance it might still hold for us now. To address these questions, however, we must not only look forward from 1940 but also back, toward a moment when poetry could seem more "public," more culturally central, than "drawing" to a young man driven to succeed. Born in 1909, Greenberg came of age in the period of "high modernism"—a designation used largely by literary historians, for whom modernism proper ends with the 1929 stock market crash, or at the latest, with the onset of World War II. The era of "mid-century modernism" (a phrase originally coined by furniture dealers) that followed was dominated, as Greenberg predicted, by the visual arts; in this period, the modernist aesthetic that had become a thing of the past where poetry was concerned continued to refine itself in painting. Before 1940, then, we have the Age of Eliot, and after, the Age of Pollock. I discuss below the crucial influence of Eliot on Greenberg, and to a degree my argument is structured by these paired res, at once polar opposites, as different as poetry and painting, and mirror images, the reigning critical mandarins of the two eras of modernism. But it is precisely because both Eliot and Greenberg ended up on the side of the victors in the struggle for dominance between the arts that another voice is required to tell the story of this conflict. For this change of perspective, I turn to the "miraculous poet," as Greenberg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> called her, Marianne Moore.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> This is not to say that Moore ended up on the side of the losers; rather, for the purposes of this argument, Moore's usefulness lies in her talent for placing herself neither in a determinate position of weakness nor one of strength, but at the point where power can be seen to shift from one side to another.</p>
<p>While Moore's talent for grasping the dialectical moment was in part a matter of temperament, it was sharpened by her response to facts on the ground. Having come to New York to pursue her writing career, Moore found herself attracted to the world of the visual arts, when painting was still the weaker party in the conflict between word and image<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup>; yet at the same moment, she was on her way to attaining canonical status among the high moderns. However, the universal endorsement of her poetic peers—she was the only one of their contemporaries equally admired by Eliot, Pound, Stevens, and Williams—could not dispel the stigma of gender. Insofar as a woman was always by definition the weaker party, Moore would hold her place among the dominant practitioners of the dominant art form on sufferance. As Eliot put it in a 1923 review, Moore's poetry "is as 'feminine' as Christina Rossetti's, one never forgets that it is written by a woman; but with both one never thinks of this particularity as anything but a positive virtue."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> To be "feminine" is a liability, except when those in authority decree that it is not; yet to do so is as much as to declare the value of femininity to be not fixed but labile. The ambiguity of Moore's situation vis-à-vis her male peers was for her at once a source of pain, and of creative energy, since the fulcrum of gender served as her primary model of the contingent and unstable character of hierarchical structures. Indeed, when such structures are called into question, it seems hard to avoid the subject of gender—Greenberg may have "borrowed paints from a girl," but in his hands, what up to that point had seemed a relatively weak medium would become an instrument of power.</p>
<p>The unstable balance of power between relatively weak and relatively strong media is the topic of a 1927 "Comment" written by Moore for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> magazine, of which she was then editor. Like Greenberg in his "Laocoon," Moore here depicts the relationship between the world of literature and the world of visual art as tense and competitive. However, from the perspective of 1927, it is the literary, or as Moore terms it, "academic" side that is in a position to set the terms of the debate with the opposite camp, whose somewhat ragtag forces are led by "that sometimes disparaged, most powerful" entity, "the museum.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Academic feeling, or prejudice possibly, in favor of continuity and completeness is opposed to miscellany—to music programs, composite picture exhibitions, newspapers, magazines and anthologies. Any zoo, aquarium, library, garden or volume of letters, however, is an anthology and certain of these selected findings are highly satisfactory. The science of assorting and the art of investing an assortment with dignity are obviously not being neglected, as is manifest in "exhibitions and sales of artistic property," and in that sometimes disparaged, most powerful phase of the anthology, the museum.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Through tone and emphasis the poet makes it clear that her sympathy is with the "disparaged" as against that "academic feeling" that lords it over other arts both high and low. With characteristic indirectness, though, she leaves us to wonder from what cultural quarter this apparently disembodied "feeling" might emanate.</p>
<p>An obvious place to turn for an answer to this question would be Eliot's 1919 essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent," the source of the most influential expression of a "feeling … in favor of continuity and completeness" in the literature of modernism.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In Eliot's words, the modern writer who possesses "the historical sense" must have "a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order." Although "the supervention of novelty" will necessarily change this ideal order, it cannot seriously breach it; rather, things are "ever so slightly, altered," "readjusted," "modified," until "conformity between the old and the new" is restored (38–9). Eliot was not an academic by profession when he stressed the essential continuity between literary modernism and literary tradition. Nevertheless, the "traditionalist" Eliot is often given the lion's share of the credit, or blame, both for academicizing literary modernism and for modernizing the literary academy. Hence William Carlos Williams could view the advent of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>  as "the great catastrophe to our letters" because it "gave the poem back to the academics."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> More recently, such critics as John Guillory, Langdon Hammer, and Gail McDonald have portrayed an Eliot singularly endowed with the power to conjure that aspect of the modern university that its constituents have come to call "the academy" into being.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> "That is," explains Hammer, "Eliot's power to project 'tradition' <span style="font-style:italic;">as an imaginary institution</span> made it an important tool for those engaged in the construction of a real one" (10; his emphasis).</p>
<p>In the years just before Eliot "gave the poem back to the academics," however, Williams had imagined a different future for literary modernism, one whose agenda was set by painters rather than poets. "Painting took the lead," according to Williams, around the time of the 1913 Armory show in New York, and those who followed that lead had the sense that the traditional order of things had indeed been breached. "Here was my chance," Williams later recalled, "that was all I knew. There had been a break somewhere, we were streaming through" . In Williams's story, the "conformity between old and new" is violently ruptured, and through the "break" streams a "we" previously excluded from a tradition that had been presumed complete and continuous. Like Moore, Williams sets the force of the visual arts against a powerfully resistant "academic feeling," but whereas for him, painting represents an anti-institutional impulse <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>, for her, the impulsive turn away from the literary academy is a moment in a dialectic. Where Williams sees a rebellion of the oppressed against a monolithic authority, Moore sees a struggle for power between two institutions, one of which is in a position to exercise prejudice while the other must suffer disparagement. Or to be more precise, one is "possibly" prejudiced while the other is "sometimes" disparaged; Moore's modifiers suggest that the relative positions of the academy and the museum may be subject to change. It is just such a reversal in the relative positions of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prejudiced and the disparaged that Greenberg marks in "Towards a Newer Laocoon," the essay on the fate of visual modernism that is perhaps most comparable in influence to "Traditional and the Individual Talent" in its situating of literary modernism. Nonetheless, we recall that Greenberg is writing just twenty years after "Tradition and the Individual Talent" when he remarks that "We ourselves, even today, are too close to literature to appreciate its status as a dominant art" . The very thought of literature's too recent dominance presses so close on Greenberg that it produces a kind of blind spot in his writing. That is to say, he is blind to the possibility that his manifesto may (like Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>) reflect a moment of transition rather than one of retrospect. By 1940, in other words, the question of which art is to be dominant may not yet have been settled.</p>
<p>If we do take this question to have remained an open one during the interwar years, it seems especially significant that as late as 1950, Greenberg himself is still presenting Eliot's early essays as his model for the sort of criticism which aims to demonstrate "that the prime fact about a work of … art is not what it <span style="font-style:italic;">means</span> but what it <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span>—how it works, how successfully it works, as art."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> It is a short step from this Eliotic credo to Greenberg's famous description of the modernist artist's proper task as "the use of the characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself—not in order to subvert it, but to entrench it more firmly in its area of competence."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> T. J. Clark, then, was being precise as well as witty when he labeled Greenberg an "Eliotic Trotskyist"; the man whom Greenberg called "a 'pure' literary critic" may be said to have laid the groundwork for the later writer's purist critique of modern art.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Just as Greenberg's "Laocoon" may be read, as he says, as "an historical apology for abstract art," so Eliot's "Tradition" may be read as an historical apology for modernist poetry. Moreover, in the postwar art world, Greenberg's power to project his version of aesthetic history "<span style="font-style:italic;">as an imaginary institution</span>" has had, as in Eliot's case, an impact incommensurate with its author's actual position—again like Eliot, he was a freelancer whose critical reputation rests on a handful of essays. Yet despite these writers' marginal relationship to the "most powerful phases" of the institutions of art, both Greenberg's version of the history of visual modernism and Eliot's version of the history of literary modernism have become in some sense the "official" versions with which one must reckon. If Greenberg is right, that "there can be such a thing as a dominant art form," then the similarities between these two simultaneously marginal and authoritative res may be not a matter of coincidence; not entirely a matter, even, of influence. Rather, Eliot and Greenberg may be said to occupy virtually the <span style="font-style:italic;">same</span> position vis-à-vis the dominant institution of art, exchanging places as the visual arts (eventually) gain ascendance over literature in the course of the twentieth century.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Although this position is manifestly one of authority, it is always latently unstable; even as Eliot asserts that the "ideal order of existing monuments" has been re-established, or Greenberg assures us that "the arts lie safe now," we can feel the ground shaking under their feet. Outsiders posing as insiders, radicals in conservatives' clothing, the source of Eliot's and Greenberg's authority is their ambivalence about that authority, an ambivalence which is all the more powerful for being held in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> check. Moore, by contrast, is <span style="font-style:italic;">openly</span> wary of the kind of cultural authority that wears the face of "prejudice." When she declines to identify fully with either the academy or the museum, instead casting her lot with the originally literary but now institutionally homeless art form that she calls "the anthology," she betrays her ambivalence about the will to dominate that Greenberg attributes to art forms, and that she discovers in art institutions. The cultural place that Moore imagines herself occupying is not, however, so much extra-institutional as it is inter-institutional: it is a position that marks a point of tension between the two dominant institutions of modernism.</p>
<p>The position occupied successively by Eliot and Greenberg enables them to serve as guarantors, however ambivalent, of what they would call the order or safety of their chosen arts. It is less clear what power, if any, might accrue to Moore in virtue of her situation in a place of open conflict between poetry and painting. Before I can approach this question, though, I must ask again: what are the stakes of this inter-institutional conflict? Why should it matter that there can be such a thing as a dominant art form? One critic who might say that the Greenbergian question of dominance does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> matter is Peter Bürger, whose use of the phrase "art as an institution" in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> has provided an impetus toward what we may call the "institutional turn" in the recent discourse of the arts.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The word "institution" lately has come to signal an author's interest in a certain sort of materialist analysis of art.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> However, while Bürger himself claims in <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory</span> that "the concept of 'art as an institution' as used here refers to the productive and distributive apparatus and also to the ideas about art that prevail at a given time and that determine the reception of works," his focus is less on material apparatus than on ideology. Thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory</span> is largely devoted to a discussion of what Bürger identifies as the dominant aesthetic ideology of our time, which asserts "the status of art in bourgeois society as defined by the concept of autonomy" ; in other words, it is a version of the argument about the role of art in modernity known as the "autonomy critique." This argument, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">locus classicus</span> is the writing of Theodor Adorno, is itself ambivalent.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> On one hand, it is a critique <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> art for its retreat to a sphere apart from the wider social world, with a consequent loss of social effectivity; on the other, it guards the ground thus gained <span style="font-style:italic;">by</span> art from which to launch a disinterested critique of a social world otherwise ruled by instrumental rationality. Bürger notes the Janus-faced character of the critique, but ultimately lays emphasis on its binding force; since <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> art in modernity is autonomous in Adorno's sense, there can be only a single institution of art.</p>
<p>When Greenberg puts forward his own version of the autonomy critique in "Towards a Newer Laocoon," he initially does so in the name of a unitary institution of art, "the avant-garde," which for him is merely another term for modernism. "The task of the avant-garde," in Greenberg's formulation, "is to perform in opposition to bourgeois society the function of finding new and adequate cultural forms for the expression of the same society, without at the same time succumbing to its ideological divisions and its refusal to permit the arts to be their own justification." However, no sooner has he offered this general prescription for avant-garde art practice, than Greenberg departs from the Adornian version of autonomy critique, proceeding to identify art's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> struggle against society with the interartistic struggle between literature and painting. As Greenberg tells it, this identification was effected when "[a]s the first and most important item upon its agenda, the avant-garde saw the necessity of an escape from ideas, which were infecting the arts with the ideological struggles of society. Ideas came to mean subject matter in general." At this point, then, painting, which had been "the chief victim of literature," emerged as the prime candidate to lead "a revolt against the dominance of literature, which was subject matter at its most oppressive" . Thus, in Greenberg's account, modern art's ambivalence about its separation from society at large takes the allegorical form of a conflict between literature and painting, between a critique that can't help but enter into the lists of "ideological struggle," and an apparently self-justifying practice whose "opposition to bourgeois society" can never announce itself as such.</p>
<p>Greenberg's own ambivalence about modernist art's autonomous character is evident in essays such as the early "Avant-Garde and Kitsch"  and the later "Plight of Culture" . In the former, he takes an explicitly Marxist stance, stressing the paradoxical relation of the avant-garde to "the ruling class of that society from which it assumed itself to be cut off but to which it has always remained attached by an umbilical cord of gold" (CE 1, 10–11). In the latter, a review of Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notes Toward the Definition of Culture</span>, postwar prosperity tempts Greenberg to imagine a capitalist utopia in which, "as Marx predicted, though not quite in the way he hoped," it might be possible "to repair the estrangement between work and culture, or rather between interested and disinterested ends."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> However, the overarching narrative of Greenberg's criticism tells of his commitment to Kantian disinterestedness in place of politically "interested" critique. Greenberg presents such commitment as an heroic sacrifice in his memoir of "The Late Thirties in New York," vowing that "some day it will have to be told how 'anti-Stalinism,' which started out more or less as 'Trotskyism,' turned into art for art's sake, and thereby cleared the way, heroically, for what was to come."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> What was to come, of course, was the rigorous Greenbergian version of art for art's sake, in which the arts "have been hunted back to their mediums, and there … have been isolated, concentrated and refined" (CE 1, 32). That medium-focused artistic purism would serve as the prevailing orthodoxy in the field of the visual arts throughout the period of the mid-century: in her monumental study of the critic's "transformation from a proper name to a dispersed critical function," Caroline Jones terms this state of affairs "the Greenberg effect."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The exorcism of "literature" as a threat to art's autonomy makes sense, then, in the context of the Eliotic Trotskyist's career-long struggle to frame art criticism as a self-justifying enterprise. The Eliotic acolyte's choice to forego literature's established prestige for a riskier investment in a rising art form is conflated with the Trotskyist apostate's choice to forego political subversion for an aesthetic entrenchment that is part alienated withdrawal, part strategic retreat. The consequences of these choices were not merely personal: for the field of art history, a relative latecomer to the fold of the humanistic disciplines, Greenberg's equation of painting with artistic autonomy <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span> offered much-needed legitimacy.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> For anyone outside the art historical  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> discipline, however, the question remains: what are the stakes of the conflict between "literature" and "painting"?</p>
<p>Yet another way to pose this question might be to ask, if "literature" and "painting" are indeed allegorical res, what are they res for? In Greenberg's "Laocoon," the two terms stand for two artistic styles, one explicit and one hermetic relative to modernist art's "function of finding new and adequate forms for the expression of [bourgeois] society." In Eliot's "Tradition," "literature" stands alone as the representative of modernism's "ideal order," i.e. its ideology, internally consistent and self-reproducing. In Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>, the opposed terms tend to take the form of institutions, although her "academic feeling" and "museum" may also be said to function as what Hammer calls "imaginary institutions." That is, "the academy" and "the museum" on one hand designate actually-existing physical plants and the social groups assembled there, and on the other, the ideologies which simultaneously reflect and shape these social formations. Insofar as such formations both require and reproduce their proper ideological justifications, they are all "imaginary institutions," junctions of the real and the ideal. However, insofar as artistic institutions seem to be not merely relatively autonomous, like other institutions—like "any zoo, aquarium, library, garden or volume of letters," as Moore says—but absolutely autonomous, they may be said to be imaginary institutions <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, symbols of the possibility of the detachment of disinterested from interested ends. Bürger claims just such a status for "art as an institution" in an essay written after <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> that revisits and partly revises that book's theme. "Autonomous art in bourgeois society," he writes, "can relate <span style="font-style:italic;">only negatively</span> to the material conditions of its production, since the autonomy of art was constituted initially in opposition to the realm of instrumental reason"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> (my emphasis).</p>
<p>As Greenberg's "umbilical cord of gold" reminds us, though, opposition in theory does not rule out connection in practice. Moreover, even without reference to the golden last instance of art's material base we can hardly fail to see how the material conditions of production shape artworks and artistic careers. William Carlos Williams and a contemporary M.F.A. student may both produce autonomous art in bourgeois society, yet they inhabit significantly different imaginary institutions, and these institutional differences have consequences for the texture of their poetry. Style, ideology, and material apparatus cannot be completely detached from one another, any more than art as such can "relate only negatively" to society in performing "the function of finding new and adequate cultural forms for the expression of the same society." If art performs a function for society, then it must relate positively to that society in some sense. The paradox of modernist art, of course, is that society needs this art to seem to have no social function; <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span>, a voice within our heads insists, must escape determination by material conditions of production that have become synonymous with "the realm of instrumental reason." However, the compulsion Greenberg feels to purge modernist art of "literature," an art that looked pure enough for Eliot, suggests that modernism may never be autonomous enough, and thus may never be secure in the position to which it has been relegated. While modernist art as such may symbolize the possibility of disinterestedness, one art or another may have to represent art's failure to be sufficiently disinterested. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The purist may simply disregard the art that fails to meet his standards—Eliot was the only major American modernist poet <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to register the challenge to his chosen art presented by painting—or he may try to cast it into outer darkness. Twenty years after "Towards a Newer Laocoon," we find Greenberg strenuously disavowing that "literature" had ever played a significant role in his argument about art's autonomy. Rather, he writes in "Modernist Painting," "[t]o achieve autonomy, painting has had above all to divest itself of everything it might share with sculpture, and it is in its effort to do this, and not so much—I repeat—to exclude the representational or literary, that painting has made itself abstract" (CE 4, 88). By contrast, the aesthete who situates herself between poetry and painting is likely to be drawn to impure, or as Moore terms them in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>, "miscellaneous" forms. Such forms are not just stylistically impure; when Moore brackets "the museum" with "exhibitions and sales of artistic property," she hints that even this loftiest of institutions may bear the taint of extra-aesthetic interests. This suspicion comes to the fore in "When I Buy Pictures," one of Moore's many poems whose title begins a thought to be completed in the poem's opening lines, acquiring a twist in the process. Thus, the would-be collector of "When I Buy Pictures" hastens to add "or what is closer to the truth, / when I look at that of which I may regard myself as the imaginary possessor."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Interested and disinterested attitudes here are uneasily juxtaposed; the disinterested position may be "closer to the truth" as Moore conceives it, yet in the gap between the title and the caveat of the poem's first lines, she remains suspended between actual and imaginary possession.</p>
<p>Moore's poems are marked throughout by such mercurial shifts between opposed positions; and these shifts find a biographical counterpart in the poet's lifelong tendency to shuttle back and forth between the worlds of painting and literature in search of allies, outlets and examples. In a suggestive essay, Lisa Steinman contrasts "the more open group conversation" that Moore encountered in the art world when she first moved to New York, with the relatively closed literary establishment represented for the ambitious young poet by Eliot and Pound. However, Steinman also observes that Moore's entry into this "extraliterary culture" came at the risk of acceding to the "possessiveness" that was the byproduct of the art world's close association with "commercial culture," a risk of which Moore herself was highly cognizant.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Thus, in the first lines of "New York," she speaks excitedly of the city as "the savage's romance/ accreted where we need the space for commerce," but by poem's end she is at pains to detach romance from commerce, insisting that what she loves about New York "is not the plunder/ but 'accessibility to experience'" (CP 54). What gives the poet the distance that she needs to make this crucial distinction is her foothold in the world of literature, whose relative detachment from economic interests brings it, like Moore as she recoils from the thought of actual possession, "closer to the truth," i.e. a disinterested stance. However, as with Moore's "academic feeling," this stance also has an element of hauteur. "Picking and Choosing," for example, begins, "Literature is a phase of life. If one is afraid of it,/ the situation is irremediable; if one approaches it familiarly,/ what one says of it is worthless" (CP 45). For the would-be adept, literature's pose of detachment also carries with it the potent threat of exclusion, just as the art world's "'accessibility to experience'" cannot be detached from its taste for "plunder." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In Moore's life and work, then, the allegorical re of painting might be said to stand for openness and commerce, and that of poetry for detachment and exclusion. And as her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span> suggests, the relationship between these art forms and their associated ideologies, on one hand, and society, on the other, is mediated by art institutions which for now we will call, with Moore, the museum and the academy. The opposed pairs of commerce and disinterestedness, openness and exclusion, may give us the beginnings of a sense of what is at stake in the struggle for dominance between poetry and painting; but to grasp why this struggle should matter to anyone outside the institution of art we must zero in on those points at which the museum and the academy are most closely linked to the wider society from which they seem to stand aloof. As Moore's unease about buying pictures and Greenberg's remark about the umbilical cord of gold indicate, the museum's most vulnerable point is its connection to what Steinman calls commercial culture. Indeed, the relationship in modernity between painting and what is more commonly called commodity culture has come to seem, if anything, <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> immediate, while poetry's pose of detachment has made its worldly ties comparatively hard to discern. However, there is a critical literature, to which I have referred briefly in discussing Eliot and "academic feeling," which connects literary modernism to the development of the modern academy, and through that institution, to what has been termed "the culture of professionalism." In the remainder of this essay, I will retrace this connection, then return to the subject of the relationship between the visual artwork and the commodity, before trying, finally, more precisely to map the point of tension between the two cultures of modernism at which Moore found herself so uneasily placed.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>We have seen how, in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Eliot manages simultaneously to expose the difficulties the modern poet encounters in establishing "conformity between the old and the new" and to assure us that they are being resolved even as we read. In a study of Eliot's career-shaping strategies, Louis Menand connects Eliot's successful handling of this artistic problem—how to deny even as you acknowledge that modernity represents a traumatic break with the past—with the success of the professionalist ideology which emerged in the mid-nineteenth century and came into its own in the twentieth.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Menand emphasizes the paradoxical character of professionalism, that it is an outgrowth of late capitalism, yet seems to go against its grain. At first glance, the professional has the look of a survival from an earlier era; he arrives on the modern scene bearing "the seal of traditional intellectuality," in the phrase of sociologist Magali Sarfatti Larson.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Thus, to the extent that professionalism seeks to promote "traditional" values, or in Larson's words, "to the extent that it does not obey first to the profit motive, but seeks first to improve the <span style="font-style:italic;">quality</span> of life," its trend seems to run counter to the most disruptive tendencies of a capitalism that Larson, like Moore, terms "savage" . However, Larson also emphasizes the paradox of professionalism; that is, as she writes, although "[t]he regulation and organization of market-oriented practice in the professions that consolidated toward the turn of the century stood in contrast to the anarchy of commodity markets and of capitalist production" , nonetheless,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "the professions' 'civilizing function' coexists, by definition, with a market orientation and is fused with it" . From one angle, the professions look like an anachronistic preserve of quality and communalism; from another, they appear as the cutting edge of standardization and corporatization. Menand describes the ways in which Eliot exploited this ambiguity to specifically literary ends, such that the poet acquired the newfound prestige of the professional (epitomized by Eliot himself, in his perennial banker's suit), while modernism took on the patina of "tradition."</p>
<p>The chief end of the professional and the poet alike is not to be left behind by the onrush of modernity, to establish a functional relation to a market-oriented society. The professional resembles the modernist artist in that the negative aspect of this relation, the "side that is turned away from the anarchy of open competition," which "fosters the values of continuity, autonomy and disinterestedness" (Menand 114), appears foremost: professionalism, like modernist art, seems to be most valuable to bourgeois society as a kind of utopian preserve of values otherwise threatened with extinction. Put somewhat more positively, by exercising a prejudice in favor of (historical) completeness and continuity, the professional and the Eliotic modernist may be said to provide a society still reeling from the shock of the new with an ideological bridge between one era and the next. Thus, just as all professionals, as Menand writes, could only "win a competitive advantage in the marketplace … by identifying [themselves] with a higher standard than self-interest" , so professionalizing modernists tended to conflate interested with disinterested ends. As Gail McDonald puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Learning to be Modern: Pound, Eliot and the American University</span>, Eliot and Pound "wanted … to reform poetry so as to re-establish its authority and to re-authorize poetry so as to reform civilization" . In theory, then, modernist poetry was to have a broadly "civilizing function." In practice, however—as the title of McDonald's study indicates—the "civilization" to be reformed by newly authoritative poet-critics in the mold of Pound and Eliot was increasingly confined to what David Lodge has jokingly but incisively called the "small world" of modern academia.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>As Lodge's phrase suggests, the "small world" of the postwar university is at once an autonomous enclave and a significant microcosm. It is significant insofar as the university, as an establisher of standards and provider of credentials, may be said to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> key institution in the culture of professionalism, "the hinge of the professional project" as Larson calls it; and it is autonomous insofar as it maintains its claim to be what I have called an imaginary institution <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, a last bastion of genuine disinterestedness. Of course, the unworldly autonomy of the institution serves, to some degree at least, as the guarantee of its worldly significance; standards lose their authority if they are perceived to be entirely subservient to interested ends. The institution's need to affirm its autonomy thus came to converge with the literary modernist's need for an institutional base from which to re-establish his authority. Like Hammer, who invokes the special power of Eliot's "tradition," McDonald portrays this convergence as almost uncanny. "At the moment it was called for," she marvels, "Eliot materialized to explain why the humanistically educated were in an ideal position to make the study of literature a serious business and why that enterprise had important consequences  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for civilization" . In other words, much as the university served as the practical guarantee of the professions' autonomy, so the humanities might serve as the ideological guarantee of the university's autonomy.</p>
<p>In the real institution built on Eliot's imaginary one, the privileged exemplum of the humanities' purity was poetry, which was conceived of as being to the least possible degree either economically or politically interested. As the well-known story goes, the appointed guardians of this purity were the New Critics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Cultural Capital</span>, his indispensable anatomy of the modern literary academy, John Guillory evokes the apotheosis of New Criticism, in which "every poem becomes an image of the very institutional space in which it is read, a perfect mirror in the imaginary of that space, alerting the company of professional readers that the retreat of literary culture into the university can be understood as a kind of transcendence of the cultural conditions of modernity" (165–6). Although this conception of poetry's role has been repeatedly traced back to Eliot, it must be remembered that Eliot's actual relations with academic institutions were marked by an ambivalent push-and-pull. His uncertain attitude may be seen as a reflection of the fact that, in the era of high modernism, the question of whether or not literary study was indeed a "serious business" was still under debate. The enshrinement, or entombment, of poetry in the academy was left to Eliot's followers to accomplish, in the postwar period when a reformed and expanded university system became newly central to the culture as a whole. Perhaps it is because literary history so closely converges on institutional history in this period that mid-century poetry, unlike mid-century painting, is not generally spoken of as "modernist," but rather is defined in terms of its practitioners' relation to the academy, whether they were poet-professors like Allen Tate and John Berryman or self-declared outsiders like the Beats.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Poetry's shift away from modernism proper is registered by John Crowe Ransom in a 1965 tribute to Randall Jarrell, when he describes Jarrell as "a 'modern' poet, if we mean one that comes soon after Pound and Eliot."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Why the quotation marks around "modern"? An indirect explanation may be found in Ransom's claim that "Randall was professional both as a poet and as a teacher of poetry." Although Ransom himself intends "professional" as a term of high praise, he does so, he says, in despite of those "[c]ritics out in the world" who "tell us when the poet takes employment in the Academy he compromises his own poetic integrity" . And of course, it is poetic integrity, i.e. a purist devotion to maintaining what Ransom calls "that distinction which is peculiar and proper to poetry," that is the mark of the true modern . "The opposite of the professional, the enemy, is the man of mixed motives," wrote Eliot in 1918, adding, as a corollary, that "professionalism is hard work on style with singleness of purpose."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> However, the "moderns" who followed in Eliot's wake experienced a tension between their poetic purism and their professional commitments; they were nothing if not "men of mixed motives." At the same time, the institution which defined both their careers and their oeuvres appeared increasingly self-contained, ever more a "small world" complete in itself. The clarity of the academy's outlines and the forcefulness of its claims to autonomy are reflected in both the number and the character of the institutional critiques it has spawned. Career studies like Menand's and Hammer's, broader analyses  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> like McDonald's and Guillory's, historical overviews like Gerald Graff's <span style="font-style:italic;">Professing Literature</span>, and the still-flourishing genre of the "academic novel" are all bound together by the assumption that "the academy," like the New Critical poem, is a more or less stable and self-reflexive object, conducive to endless interpretation.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The museum, like the academy, is self-enclosed and self-referential, and radiates an authority that derives at once from its huge accumulations of cultural capital and from its claim to be a uniquely disinterested custodian of these spoils. Many artists and art theorists have been drawn, like Moore, to this authority, and have made "the museum" shorthand for the institution of visual art.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> However, while museums may be, as Carol Duncan writes, "the supreme spaces of the high-art world," they do not define that world's limits. Duncan herself offers this definition of visual art as an institution.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>That world can be described in many ways—as a magnet for creative talent, an elitist enclave, a zone of personal freedom, a community of the alienated. Whatever else it is, however, the modern world of high art is an international market centered in New York City and emanating out to rival centers in London, Milan, Tokyo and the other great centers of capitalism. Like any market, it is organized around the production and use of commodities, in this case luxury objects produced by small manufacturers.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The museum is enmeshed in a network of more commercial enterprises which, if less authoritative than this "most powerful" of institutions taken one by one, taken all together may tip the balance of the institution of visual art toward economically interested ends. This network is the elaboration of what Cynthia and Harrison White (an art historian and sociologist, respectively) have termed "the dealer-critic system," which came into existence in late nineteenth-century France to replace the state-sponsored academic system that previously had ruled the world of the visual arts. According to the Whites, this shift occurred when the rise of the bourgeoisie led to a "[d]ispersion of buying power … to which the dealer-critic system could adapt much more effectively than the centralized official machine."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This dispersion of economic resources in its turn produced an ever more decentered and diversified institution of art that today encompasses galleries, art fairs, auction houses, private collections, and even casinos, as well as museums and universities. While the Whites' description of this system in its emergence is exceptionally lucid and useful, nevertheless I prefer to their term for the institution of visual art the one that is most frequently used in practice, although not in theory. That term is "the art world."</p>
<p>When I say that there is no theory of "the art world," I mean that there is no fulllength systematic study that seeks to bind together all the diverse components of the modern institution of visual art under a single rubric.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> This institution is called "the art world" by all of its constituents, from professors to dealers to street-fair artists, and yet the phrase is not in any dictionary of visual art terms. One explanation for this significant absence might be that the art world, unlike the academy, is unstable and amorphous; there is no genre of the "art world" novel, because this world lacks the compactness and clearly defined hierarchical order that links the world of academia to that of Jane Austen. However, the air of scandal that attends Duncan's claim that the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> institution of modern visual art is above all a <span style="font-style:italic;">market</span> is, I believe, a sign of the deeper reason for the art world's reluctance to speak its name. As per the Whites' account of the dealer-critic system's emergence, the moving parts of the art world are closely fitted to the movements of capital: this institution is less autonomous relative to the market than is the academy. The "market" on which academics sell themselves is still highly regulated, centralized, and driven by the desire more for prestige than for profit. The market on which artists and their agents sell their things is a barely regulated, high stakes business.</p>
<p>Of course, certain parts of the art world, such as public art projects, academic art history and art training, and above all, the museum, are more autonomous than others.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Paradoxically, though, the literature of the museum is perhaps the richest source of references to the "scandalous" open secret of the art world's relation to the market. Adorno, to take just one example, calls the museum "a metaphor … for the anarchical production of commodities in fully developed bourgeois society."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Nonetheless, a century of such exposés has not yet quite managed to break the spell that enables the museum to serve as, in Thomas Crow's words, "that special preserve where the commodity character of modern cultural production is sealed off from apprehension."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The reason "the museum" looks at times like <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> "imaginary institution" of visual art, the reason it has received so much institutional analysis as compared with the grimy world of galleries and auction houses and art fairs, which has gone almost untouched by the better sort of critic, is that the museum alone among the fragmented parts of the institution of modern art appears to have the authority to sustain the paradox that inheres in Crow's description.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>To put this paradox another way: the character of the modern institution of visual art is such that it can be, indeed, must be, wide open to penetration by the forces of the market and at the same time "sealed off" from them. Just as the literary academy serves as the ultimate guarantee of professionalist culture's utopian claim to be a preserve of quality in a quantified world, so the art world serves as the ultimate guarantee of what one might call the market's utopian aspects: anarchic energy, experimentalism, and above all, democratic openness, especially to those previously excluded by more "traditional," hierarchical power structures. However, in order to affirm these virtues of the market, the art world must purify them of their associations <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> the market.</p>
<p>In sum, although they are in crucial ways opposed to one another, the institutions of poetry and painting each in its own way exemplifies the contradictory character of the institution of art as a whole, the conflict between its apparently negative relation to bourgeois society, and that same society's demand that it serve an affirmative function, as the guarantee of its most cherished values. Adorno's own formulation of this thought is that "[w]hile art is driven into a position of absolute negativity, it is never absolutely negative precisely because of that negativity. It always has an affirmative residue." In other words, art is a preserve of the utopian hopes of a society in which actual social change seems impossible. Adorno cautions that art's intimations of such change are only "an illusion," but adds that "what has no being none the less represents a promise, if it has the ability to appear" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> 332). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The final question I want to pose, then, is this: how can a modernist art committed to a stance of "absolute negativity" represent positively conceived social goods? Adorno's answer is "only in dimmed form, as though it were a dream" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> 320). Keeping this caveat in mind, we may still try to interpret the dream, which is the collective dream of the adherents of modernism. The tenets of these adherents' faith require them to agree with Adorno that no value may be affirmed from <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the institution of art; such affirmation may only appear as a "residue," that which is extrinsic to art as such. Those who try to generate affirmation from within art fall prey to a vulgar idealism, as when Greenberg comes to believe, as Clark says in his mordant critique of his precursor, that "art can substitute <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> for the values that capitalism has made valueless" . However, this is not to say that society's utopian claims may be pressed on art from <span style="font-style:italic;">outside</span> its institutional bounds. To believe this places one in the camp of the vulgar materialists, who see in artistic illusion not a "promise" but a lie which may be exposed, in Adorno's words, by "calling culture as a whole into question from outside under the general notion of ideology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Prisms</span> 31). Adorno himself rejects both of these critical positions in favor of close reading, or as he terms it, "immanent criticism." Like the art he favors, Adorno's preferred form of critique is "not one which resolves objective contradictions in a spurious harmony," as the New Criticism has been accused of doing, "but one which expresses the idea of harmony negatively by embodying the contradictions … in its innermost structure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Prisms</span> 32).</p>
<p>I have tried to "read" the institution of modern art, then, as if it were a work of modernist art, one that generated its own critique out of its structural contradictions. Central to my argument is the contradiction between the notion of the institution of art as unified under the rubric of autonomy, and the notion of that institution as divided by the antagonism between two claimants to the right to represent the autonomous ideal, antagonists that sometimes go by the names of "literature" and "painting." While the autonomous, or negative, character of the institution of art may be the condition of its continued existence in bourgeois society, the possibility of its immanent critique depends on the fracture that runs through it, creating the illusion that the two cultures of modernism are external to one another. Each of these two cultures, in its respective imaginary institution, has been designated as the bearer of a particular utopian claim of society as a whole: literary academia, of that impulse that "does not obey first to the profit motive, but seeks first to improve the <span style="font-style:italic;">quality</span> of life," and the art world, of an openness, an "accessibility to experience," that is a prerequisite of true democracy. Again, these claims cannot be pressed from within the institutions supposed to preserve them. However, the ambiguous stance adopted by both Eliot and Greenberg vis-à-vis their chosen institutions—the outsider-as-insider—gave them the authority to affirm utopian values <span style="font-style:italic;">as if</span> from within. In fact, though, each of these two critics wielded his authority in the name of the characteristic value of the institution opposed to his own: Eliot was primarily concerned to find, or make, an opening in an always already complete and continuous tradition for that arriviste, "the new (the really new) work of art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Essays</span> 5); while Greenberg made the Eliotic credo, "professionalism is hard work on style with singleness of purpose," the watchword of the art world. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Both Eliot's demand that his "ideal order" exhibit greater openness, and Greenberg's conviction that the imperative driving modern art history is stylistic rather than economic, then, do not arise from within each critic's chosen institution, but from outside it, or rather, from the illusion that there <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> an outside produced by the division within the autonomous institution of art. "In the room the women come and go/ Talking of Michaelangelo," messengers from the imaginary institution beyond; but like Greenberg's "literature," Prufrock's visitors from the art world ultimately represent a threat to his sense of autonomy.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Like Eliot and Greenberg, Moore demarcates with great precision such points of conflict between the academy and the art world, but unlike them, she cannot speak "as if from within" either one of these institutions. The position to which she understands herself to have been relegated is that of one of the women who come and go between the rooms, but in taking up this position she transforms it. As drift, in her hands, becomes conscious art, weakness is converted into a kind of strength. The Eliotic or Greenbergian modernist sees the (feminine or feminized) visitor from another room as violating the "sealed off" space of autonomous art; but seen in light of that art's immanent critique, the wandering woman appears possessed of the unique power to press the utopian claims of each imaginary institution against the other, <span style="font-style:italic;">as if</span> from outside.</p>
<p>Because the relationship between the two institutions of modern art has been unstable, the claims of one institution or another have seemed more pressing, depending on which appeared to be the more "disparaged" of the two at a given time. Thus Moore, in her role of outsider, displays a certain bias in favor of "the museum" as compared with "academic feeling." However, Moore also sensed the potential for dominance in the museum, as the "most powerful phase" of the collection of lesser institutions she groups under the rubric of the "miscellany." In this respect, her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span> preres the shift in power relations between the academy and the art world that Greenberg somewhat prematurely announces in 1940, but that by now has become unmistakable. The current dominance of visual art in the realm of high art may be said to represent "in dimmed form, as though it were a dream" the triumph of the values of the market over those of professionalism, a triumph that if sufficiently overwhelming would cancel the possibility of pressing the utopian claims of our culture "as if from outside." One's impulse in such circumstances is to display a bias in favor of poetry, which was once the "most powerful" representative of "academic feeling," although it is now "sometimes disparaged." Hence my decision to frame the story of interartistic struggle in Moore's terms. These terms are laid out with especial starkness in an early poem, "To Statecraft Embalmed," which depicts a contest between two opposing aesthetic attitudes that takes place in a "steep, too strict" place, a virtual fissure (CP 35). The antagonists' struggle for dominance provokes "suicidal dreams" in the poet's persona, which finally comes to "attack its own identity, until/ foe seems friend and friend seems/ foe." This is the hazard of placing oneself smack between two warring parties: one cannot be sure whose side one is on. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>The aforementioned books by Guillory, Hammer, and McDonald are strong examples of the trend toward "institutional" thinking about literature. Another influential work in this mode is Lawrence Rainey's <span style="font-style:italic;">Institutions of Modernism: Literary Elites and Public Culture</span> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998). My own thinking has been much affected by Rainey's study, particularly by his canny discussion of instances in which modernist poets and publishers looked to the art world in search of fresh strategies of self-presentation and promotion. Despite certain definitional difficulties, which I discuss below, some art historians have also taken the institutional line; see, for example, the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Art History and Its Institutions: Foundations of a Discipline</span>, ed. Elizabeth Mansfield (New York: Routledge, 2002). And in the late 1960s, a number of visual artists, including  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Michael Asher, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, and Hans Haacke began to work in the genre of "institutional critique," producing art that reflects on the conditions of its host institutions. The 1990's saw a revival of this genre; one prominent second-wave practitioner, Andrea Fraser, acknowledges her debt to Bürger in a provocative essay in which she sketches the history of this movement and assesses its accomplishments ("From the Critique of Institutions to an Institution of Critique," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Artforum International</span> 44, no. 1 [September 2005]: 278–283 and 332).</p></div>

Jones's book aims, and to a remarkable extent succeeds, at being the last word on the sources and meanings of Greenberg's influence. And yet: while Jones can't help but notice that poetry played a significant role in the formation of the critic's persona, the continued operation of the Greenberg effect makes it hard for her to bring that role into focus. Thus, in a discussion of "[t]he <span style="font-style:italic;">paragone</span> underlying the history of the Laocoonic trope—namely, the Renaissance conceit that representational painting, not poetry, is master of the arts," she concludes that "[t]he shifting fortunes of visual art in the <span style="font-style:italic;">paragone</span> have only limited interest for us" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f24" href="#f24-text">24. </a>In using the phrase "cultures of modernism," I echo Malcolm Bull, who in his essay "Between the Cultures of Capital" (<span style="font-style:italic;">New Left Review</span>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ser, 11 [2006]: 95–113) makes an argument that verges on mine at several points. He, too, see modernist style as shaped by the competition for dominance between two forces, "commodity culture," which he associates with the visual arts, and the more vaguely defined "classical culture" ("tradition" again, but with an emphasis on Western tradition's classicizing and neo-classical phases), which he associates with no art in particular. Like other art historians, that is, Bull tends to write literature out of the story of modernism. Thus, having disposed of the straw man of "classical culture," Bull leaves us, like later Greenberg, in a world in which painting's influence goes unchecked by any counterforce. Unlike Greenberg, though, Bull takes a dark view of this situation: painting in its triumph, he says, has made of modernism "a fully commodified practice, without foundation or metanarrative" . As I suggest below, I see this as a possible, but not necessary, outcome of the Greenbergian story.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>In the course of pursuing other arguments, some art critics and art historians, Duncan and Fraser among them, have remarked on the limitations of "the museum" as an institutional descriptor and offered in its place a more comprehensive account of the components of the art world. None, however, has followed up on the Whites' effort to produce a synthetic view of this institution.
<p class="display">It must be noted here as well that philosophical aesthetics <span style="font-style:italic;">has</span> produced a "theory of the art world"; for the debate around this theory, see <span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology</span>, eds. George Dickie, Richard Sclafani and Ronald Roblin, 2nd ed. (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) 171–217. The theory is most closely associated with Arthur Danto, who argues in his 1964 essay, "The Artworld," that "[t]o see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry–an atmosphere of artistic theory: an artworld" . Only a surrounding "atmosphere of artistic theory," he claims, can explain why a Duchampian jest like Andy Warhol's Brillo Box is widely recognized as a work of art. Danto omits to say how he came by his name for this atmosphere; it may be supposed that he has conflated "lifeworld," a philosophical term connoting lived experience of a particular environment, with "art world," a colloquialism he picked up while gallery-going in New York. Nevertheless, although the central examples in his argument are drawn from the world of contemporary visual art, his theory is not designated as being specific to that social sphere.</p><p class="display">In "The New Institutional Theory of Art," George Dickie criticizes Danto for focusing on artistic theory to the exclusion of that theory's social framework, that is, "the institutions of art-making" . However, Dickie's institution of art, unlike Bürger's, is not a specifically modern creation. Rather, his version of the "artworld" concept encompasses all of the arts throughout history; in his schema, the "artworld" just is the arts' social surround. Dickie entirely misses the pun through which Danto connects the artworld concept to what the latter identifies as "the history of recent New York painting," and Danto fails to make the pun explicit because he is too quick to detach theory from practice, the "atmosphere" of the art world from its institutions.</p><p class="display">In short, neither Danto nor Dickie explain how or why the term "art world" has come, some time over the course of the last century, to be the most commonly used name for the social sphere of the visual arts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Artworlds</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982), Howard Becker accuses Danto and his fellow aestheticians of being insufficiently "empirical" in their accounts of the institution  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of art ; but Becker, too, uses "artworld" to refer to the social surround of the arts in general, without stopping to consider the provenance of the term. In my view, this provenance determines the meaning of the term.</p></p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f36" href="#f36-text">36. </a>In an essay titled "Conflicting Visions in American Art Museums" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Theory and Society</span> 10, no. 4 [1981]: 103–25), Vera Zolberg tracks two closely related changes that took place in the organization of American art museums around the mid-century. Museum staffers sought both to make their institutions more autonomous relative to their major funders, and to bring a more professionalized approach to their own work. However, Zolberg concludes that although these efforts succeeded to some degree, ultimately, a "lack of insulation from markets and the relative accessibility of non-professionals to [the museum's] information helps to explain why the parallels between museums and other institutions, such as universities and hospitals, is not more striking" .

To fix even the simplest fact requires scavenging in monographs and memoirs—which tells us something about the curtained reticence of the art world" .

<p>Only weeks apart in 1886, two events occurred in rival American centers of international trade. On April 10, "The Special Exhibition of Works in Oil and Pastel by the Impressionists of Paris" opened at the American Art Association on Madison Square in New York City. Less than a month later on May 4, a bomb, and retaliatory police bullets, exploded at an anarchist protest meeting near Haymarket Square in Chicago, the city's only market for local producers and small merchantry including greengrocers and truckfarmers. Beginning in the bloody suppression of the McCormick Reaper Works strike and ending in the sensational trial of eight anarchists, the execution of four, and the suicide of a fifth, the Haymarket incident and its mass print images specularized class conflict. America's first impressionist exhibition and its first red scare were lived at once, as simultaneous spectacles blurring the political economy of foreign art and the capitalist crisis dividing the nation while 600,000 workers agitated for the eight-hour day.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Two sources of economic anxiety, foreign-born labor and imported modernism, blended in public responses to the exhibition that associated the subversive politics of European anarchy and French impressionism; the consumer cultures of Madison Square and Haymarket Square; the exchange value of foreign art and domestic commodities. The "good bourgeois of New York," stated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Art Age</span>, were "flocking to look at the impressionists and to read their own condemnation" in images the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collector</span> regarded as "phantasms of dynamitic dexterity." Shapeless fears of post-Civil War America's "dynamite fiends," its "red-mouthed devils," took form in "explosions of paint," "rioting in color," and liquid fragments like "blood and ghastly wounds." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "Alien dealers" had introduced into the domestic economy "something monstrous," perhaps from the "planet Venus or Mars." Invasion—from the Old World and other worlds—became a mass culture metaphor for international capitalist competition.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>From the start, impressionist painting destabilized the commodity-form, passing duty-free through U.S. Customs, and shifting between taxed (sold) and exempted (exhibited) forms. It acquired or lost its commodity character from its sites of public display, in this case the sales galleries of the American Art Association in April 1886, and the loftier halls of the National Academy of Design the following month. The Association proprietor James F. Sutton, formerly of Macy's Fourteenth Street Bazaar, and the French dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, relocated their venture at a safe distance from dealers angered that Sutton, keeping one foot in and the other outside commerce, escaped the notorious thirty-percent duty on imported art. At the height of 1889 congressional tariff debates, the trade divided over statutes allowing associations to import on commission, but requiring dealers to pay at entry. The final split came when William Schaus and other New York dealers filed fraud charges with the U.S. Treasury Department against their major competitors for the French market including the American Art Association and the Grevin American Company. Organized under an association charter, Sutton's exhibition was a tax dodge for a "speculative venture," claimed his adversaries. Soon to follow was the ruin of legitimate dealers forced to pay import duties "even before seeing the goods."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Cultural critics saw it this way. French dealers anxious for new profit streams in America created a desire for impressionism to offset depleted stores of authentic Barbizon paintings. The rhetoric of artificial value intensified among those who agreed that while the impressionist market originated in Barbizon "counterfeits," American finance capital and its class structure promoted "wholesale forgery" [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Reformists considered the point in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Forum</span>, a new monthly positioning the fine arts in 1886 alongside labor unionism, socialism, and free trade. The columnist rhymed his critique of the gallery system with an indictment of new wealth from nothing—wartime profiteers whose massive paper fortunes accrued from runaway currency expansion and speculative exploits connecting railroads to Wall Street. America was rich soil for French dealers because the "unfettered powers of issuing bonds and mortgages possessed by railroad presidents and trustees and the guardian angels of corporations" had produced an "abnormally" large ruling class. Gambling on "prospective value as an investment" and the "irrefutable logic of public auction sales," millionaires speculated in Barbizon paintings "constantly rising, rising, like shares in a successful silver-mine." When word spread that the "stock had been watered beyond measure," buyers took the news in stride, counting forgery among the risks of "commercial life" until tumbling prices confirmed that "Rousseau and Diaz stock was not as secure an investment as had been believed."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Meanwhile, having "made a corner" in impressionist paintings abroad, Durand-Ruel planned to "boom them and to open a market in America," wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Herald</span>. Many believed him no worse than American dealers, who continued "booming" any Barbizon "daub, potboiler or scrap" until their French competitors proved impressionist art "saleable." The "boom on this side of the ocean" determined  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Monet's production system, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Evening Transcript</span>. Therefore, he "takes several canvases out at once, paints awhile on one, then works on the second, and so on, repeating the same subject," a practice that would continue "as long as Monet spells money." Like American greenbacks, Monet's landscapes acquired value from serial repetition, but slipped between capital goods and fiat paper currency to represent both commodity and its exchange system. Particularly after Monet's commercial success in 1892, market watchers interpreted the shift from realism to impressionism to mean "fictitious values," similar to credit, now displaced "staple goods."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The impressionist series, however, represented both future production and overproduction. Popular audiences related seriality to Barbizon forgery, each resembling industrial piecework, or the fabrications of a "vast studio in which half a dozen partners …  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> manufacture bogus pictures."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> The impressionist commodity-form combined fraud and the factory system, causing some to suspect that Renoir might be an entire "syndicate of artists" turning out canvases for "American millionaires of Oshkosh"; his nudes perhaps were assembled by three artists, one painting the heads, another the bodies, and a third the landscape settings. But Monet, calibrated to market dynamics, was a "machine" that produced and destroyed without distinction. Landscape fragments cut from "consecutive yards of the same blinding pattern of chintz" bore at once the stamp of machinery and the "grimace of a prostitute," wrote Alfred Trumble, the influential editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collector</span>. Here was the end expression of techno-sexual violence that "tears all grace" from a harvest field. Monet "rips [land] into iron lines and jigs it into saw edges," he "carves it," "mangles it," and "batters it," flattening gender difference into "Nature of cast iron." Despoiled earth and female filth combined in Trumble's fantasy that an impressionist bather (unidentified) turned the waters "green of her own periodical putrescence"; his fears of sexual deviance and sexless machines red in his imaginings that "no man" could perceive nature as the impressionists did and "avoid prompt suicide." At the same time, Trumble's vision reflected everyday relations, natural and social worlds turned upside down, women and capital colliding. The "putrescence" he sublimated into the impressionist female body surfaced in Chicago's mobs of unsexed women strikers, "guerillas in petticoats," or "amazons … affected with a malignant form of the eight-hour malady."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Trumble wrote all this in 1891, the year of Monet's first one-person exhibition in America, when social pathology mirrored larger hygienic delusions and dread at foreign contagion. An international cholera epidemic spreading from Asia reached the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> by way of a report from the Red Sea shores. "There is nowhere any attempt at sanitation," wrote the correspondent, "the ground is foul, the air fetid by reason of the rotting offal." Trumble drew foreign commodities into the contemporary discourse of disease, cautioning against Monet's river scenes, "slimy pools, fouler than the accursed waters of the Dead Sea … Would any reasonable being … drink from those fetid rills?" The epidemic flared in 1892, and with it economic tensions, so much so that U.S. President Benjamin Harrison ordered a twenty-day quarantine on all vessels and foreign goods arriving from infected ports. The presidential action translated into sensational headlines announcing "Cholera at the Gate," and sent profits reeling on Wall Street and the Chicago Board of Trade. Reporters simultaneously tallied cholera victims in Paris, trade losses in Chicago, and Monet's profits in Boston, the site of his second one-person American exhibition, which included a glimpse of his seriality, two images of <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>. Depressed by a weak foreign market, the value of real wheat and other grains plummeted and nervous Chicago speculators liquidated their positions.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>French impressionism situated itself in an increasingly speculative American art economy that displaced the consumer object with the interest it accrued or "capital invested therein." In 1885, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> introduced a secondary market of disinterested American buyers who considered art an "investment for future realization … staple goods, to be bought and sold over and over again, like calico, wool, or silk … safer and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> better than to invest in land or a house." To circulate rather than own, there existed "scarcely any investment safer and more disposable than objects of the fine arts."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Three years later, the elite critic William Howe Downes announced a turn in the selfconsuming market from "bread-and-butter art to caviar," from solid Salon fare to the impressionists' "curious and piquant flavors." New exotic tastes meant that dealers now determined trends in a marketplace distancing investors from products. Corporate capitalists hired a "picture-seller to choose their paintings for them, as they permit the upholsterer to select their curtains and draperies." Further, "picture-merchants say that they have customers who buy entire new collections to replace old ones at stated intervals."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> For others, a well-known provenance raised status value but put a ceiling on the potential resale of paintings considered a "dearer kind of wallpaper." Price must stay beyond the reach of "people who finger your curtains and make remarks about your furniture, indicating complete knowledge of where they were bought and how much they cost." This "secretive" collector understood that repeated appearances in the marketplace made art illiquid. Retreads, so called now, had no appeal then to the collector who "hates to have anyone recognize a painting on his walls because he values it simply and solely on the basis of cash." Broad audiences too adopted the speculator's language, wariness at dealers' "bogus bids," the "booming of foreign pictures into fictitious values," and early forms of flipping, retreads, and secret global reserve contracts, all clouding the issue of value. But the cyclical pattern of two late-capitalist eras remains clear: "Short-term investors in art are like day traders in the stock market," recently stated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span>. Linking the two economies was a new index of New York City art auction prices, the Mei-Moses Index, modeled after the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Monet's early collectors too manipulated the market with storied indifference, "buying for a 'rise,' or with a view to a 'sale,'" wrote critics of his day. Impressionism was the art of America's new business money, the <a href="http://dot.com" target="_blank">dot.com</a> stock of the 1890s attracting investors before turning a profit.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Between the Civil and Spanish-Cuban-American Wars, the popular equation shifted from painting = money to bidding = price fetish. The drive to fetishize price coincided with impressionist seriality that blurred capital and commodity, but visualized transitions from accumulation to speculation, merchant to finance capital, and goods to "intangible assets."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> The future value of Chicago city blocks, prairie grids, and French landscapes flowed beyond consumption into this modern economy named by Thorstein Veblen. By "intangible assets," he meant the current value of anticipated gains from systems that produced nothing, but made money, including credit and advertising. Veblen recognized physical and intangible capital as mutable, often interdependent categories, and reasoned, "This creation of tangible wealth out of intangible assets is seen perhaps at its neatest in the enhancement of land values." Land futures were central to Veblen's meditations on capital, notably where he rethinks assets from "physical things" to a "pecuniary concept," and distinguishes capital from capital goods. The extension of assets beyond the material was the first stage in comprehending the reciprocal conversion of tangible into intangible forms. Nowhere was the dynamic more apparent than capitalized property, combining land ("physical magnitude") and real estate ("pecuniary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> magnitude"). While each was a tangible asset, the economic forces determining its future value were not.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Reading publics understood that related market mechanisms—good will (the prestigious name of a collector or the powerful name of a corporation), real estate agents, rent, trusts and tariffs, art dealers, auctions, publicity, and supply—converted land and art into pure forms of liquidity streaming through an unstable economy. So did the "collector for revenue only." Coined by a New Yorker, the term derived from "tariff for revenue only," the 1880 Democratic Party plank supporting lower tariffs and the expansion of foreign trade. A <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> columnist linked free trade profits to Chicago's soaring real estate values by comparing art and land speculators, each seeking a "profitable investment for their surplus funds." Because the collector for revenue only had the capital to "beat down the artist's price" he could acquire "property which will increase in value at a more fabulous rate than Chicago real estate … Buying pictures which are sure to rise in value, such a collector … is accumulating a fund which he may draw upon at will when reverses in other speculations require it." In New York, a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> writer observed, "Good pictures are as good an investment as Brooklyn real estate, and if it is ever necessary to sell them, they bring as round an interest and profit."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Veblen's theory points to Fredric Jameson's concerning finance capitalism today, land speculation, and its culture of cinematic fragments and intangible money. Land speculation, he proposes, is at the origins of dematerializations of currencies and territories in cyberspace substituting global cities for solid ground. This "becoming abstract of land and the earth" means the "transformation of the very background or context of commodity exchange into a commodity in its own right," which in turn provokes new autonomous art forms.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> From here, we may begin to think impressionism through post-Civil War and postmodern luxury economies, and contests over the representation of value, without losing the epochal resonance of the 1890s. Monet abstracted Giverny into landscapes at a moment when late nineteenth-century investors transformed land into "liquid money," as Zola put it. Throughout his novels <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Argent, La Curée</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, wheat and gold flow together in speculative waves representing fortunes in constant flux. Zola blurs the economies of field and finance, begging and betting, in the venal Saccard, a high-risk speculator who "disdained to glean and pick up the gold which men … dropped behind them." His wealth was boundless, a "flood of gold … a sea of twenty-franc pieces … swelling from a lake to an ocean." The image of Saccard swimming through vast fortunes accrued in schemes reaching to the Middle East is set against peasants adrift in a world market, and about to drown in a "river, a torrent, a flood" of American wheat. The surplus of foreign wheat, predicted the schoolmaster in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, would turn French fields to "streams of blood, so that the land will once again be able to provide bread."</p>
<p>Water and wheat, blood and money, commingled in 1903 when Frank Norris likened Chicago's fevered speculation in a "Niagara of wheat" to money afloat: "All through the Body of Things, money, the vital fluid, seemed to be flowing more easily … it was … liquefying." The character of wheat in Norris's <span style="font-style:italic;">Octopus</span>, "neither solid nor fluid,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the character of his speculators who "never saw the wheat they traded in," provides our two directions.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> On one hand, I suggest that speculating reconciled the two-sided meaning of impressionism—as anarchy and commodity—amidst international tariff and currency debates upending the commodity-category, its valuation, and money. On the other, I use Monet patronage in Chicago, the hub of commodity futures and labor strikes, to equalize the impressionist commodity and its resistance to the market economy. My focus is the first American patron to recognize Monet's seriality, Berthe Honoré Palmer, and her nine canvases of <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. My point is to relate these to "liquid money" in and outside capitalism, and her serial collecting to the seriality inhabited by Chicago's women millionaires, speculators, and workers. What follows blends popular press accounts with Igor Kopytoff's "cultural biography of things," most importantly his analogizing the "way societies construct individuals and the way they construct things." Where these processes become transparent, we might consider what the private collecting of French grain imagery and open outcry trading in Chicago's wheat pit tell us about the complex cultures of capitalism.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The impressionist series absorbed competing stores of value financial conservatives declared real or fiat. Outside the gold and greenback economy, however, groups practiced oppositional "moneyless commerce," including forms of barter such as cooperative media coupons traded for goods or labor on Chicago's communist South Side. Like Zola's collectivist Sigismond, who declaimed, "Money must be killed," Chicago immigrant labor and farm communities similarly exchanged goods between "those who cannot afford money." Collective identity—"Aliens Barter Among Themselves"—formed through difference from "rude barbarians who insist upon being paid for their goods in gold."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Around the same time, the adopted Chicagoan L. Frank Baum enchanted children of the 1893 Depression with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span>  and Emerald City, where green skies and sunbeams cast land in luminous riches, but green pennies limited money to its irreducible form. Baum later wrote money out of Oz altogether and with it, the rich and the poor. Impressionist modernity too operated outside the marketplace because the "necessarily vitiating element of salability was unconsidered," wrote an admiring critic. Its "absence of concession to the market" was stronger by contrast to "shoppy" old master and Barbizon works. What emerged as anxiety and desire in the impressionist market exploded in a burst of post-Civil War strike violence. In 1886, a flashpoint of labor unrest, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> predicted the great industrial strikes of the 1890s, stating that the current art market "illustrates the dangerous increase of individual wealth as much as it does the advancement of general taste."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Highly publicized auctions and record prices set off rumblings of "actual criminality" among columnists who considered it a "reckless use of cash to put the value of a first class city house and lot" into art. The Depression of 1883–1886 and Eight-Hour Campaigns filled the streets with "monster" cross-class festivals while auctioneers staged counter-pageants of elite solidarity announced in headlines: "Railroad Magnates and Other Speculators Succeed in Capturing the Most Desired Costly Prizes." The roles performed in "theatrical auctions" were clear. Out of sight behind red velvet curtains, the "mysterious gloved hands" of disarticulated labor made paintings appear before an  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "opera audience in street dress." The real draw was the carnivalesque spectacle of the ruling elite taking on the character of unruly masses. These were highbrow versions of crowd scenes "where throngs of well-dressed people [wait] to see rich men struggle with each other for famous pictures."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Cane-brandishing millionaires "scrambled and fought for the pictures" in a riot of top hats, fans, opera glasses, and furs. In the thick of cutthroat competition, one glared at another as if "to choke off that exasperating five-hundred dollar bidder." Their decidedly "Anglo-Saxon quality, pugnaciousness … drove the pictures up, up, up," cheered on by a noisy and "immense audience greeting each famous picture with applause," until people and objects became phantasmagoric, the "vast public … itself a spectacle hardly less curious than half the contents of the collection."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Just as auctions made crowds and collections indistinguishable, and strikes did the same for labor and commodity, the collector became capital. In March 1886, a month before the first impressionist exhibition in America, luxury and labor economies organized into two powerful spectacles—the Morgan auction in New York City and the thirty-first anniversary celebration of the Paris Commune in Chicago. Newspapers in both cities announced the sale of the staggering collection formed by Mary J. Morgan after the death of her husband Charles, a "hard-faced, hard-fisted, hard-dealing" shipping magnate. Mary Morgan was the female grotesque, inert and bloated on lucre. A parody of her husband's wealth, her body was "encrusted with diamonds, with pockets so heavy with sudden-gotten gold that she could hardly stir." Her uncorseted distention spilled throughout her "mansion stuffed with greenbacks and with coupon-bearing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> bonds so numerous and multitudinous that she literally gave them away by the cabfull." She turned physical and paper wealth to waste, collecting by "throwing into the very gutter of extravagance the money her husband toiled so long, so hard to get."</p>
<p>Society rumors stopped short of "art mania," but repeated the irrational prices Morgan paid for art, jewels, and bric-a-brac as evidence of her "simple mind." Lacking the eye of a collector, she was a senseless "buyer." Obsessive collecting and its vulgar sister, shopping, were symptoms of consumer delirium perhaps brought on by widowhood, but more likely by a gendered "internal complication" that "disturbed her mind." Popular comment derived from late nineteenth-century medical discourse on female pathologies—kleptomania, collectomania, monomania—attributing these to reproductive disorders and the hysteric female imaginary. Diagnosed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Morgan was "disjointed … and whether it was mental, moral, or physical is hard to decide." What was clear was the economic threat posed by a woman who devoured and expelled her husband's capital, and by extension him: "Spend, spend, spend seemed to be the motive of her existence … as though she wanted to get rid of the money as fast as she got it."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> What if such women escaped their mansions and mobilized in public spaces of commerce, such as street, department store, trading pit, and auction? Selfmultiplying women—strikers, shoppers, speculators, collectors—easily could spread the contagion of bargaining, buying, betting, and bidding. The destructive potential of female crowds in the marketplace, ruled by their deviant passion for goods, raised fears of economic disorder and worse. Upheavals and reversals in gender relations were the apparitions conjured to demonize female labor; but, as we will see, these transcended class boundaries in Berthe Palmer's Chicago, where Haymarket Square, Marshall Field's, and the Chicago Board of Trade provided women multiple theatres for the performance of economic self-determination.</p>
<p>"If you wish to know why $18,000 can be spent for a little [snuff] bottle whose maker got about $5 for it … inquire of John Swinton and Henry George," wrote a reporter at the Morgan auction.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> His references to the leader of the Communist Workingman's Party in New York and to the founder of the populist Single Tax Movement named the class tensions directly beneath public fascination with the privileged. Even the prominent art critic Albert Wolff regarded auction bids, or purchasing power, as the marker of difference, stating that the convergence of "all the men who pay $20,000 for a picture" ranked among the world's "astonishing spectacles." During the 1889 Universal Exposition, when Andrew Carnegie and American finance capital invaded Paris to bid on Jean-François Millet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus</span> , and thus escalate an international tariff war, Wolff thought it a "pity that we cannot exhibit these millionaires for the benefit of the poor!" Alongside the exotic elite, "what would be the streets of Cairo, the Japanese village, or Buffalo Bill in comparison."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Fierce bidding made for striking pictures in the press, but paintings often disappeared in a welter of numbers: "The third lot of the 80 paintings sold for $487,925, or $70,550 in excess of the sum received for the 160 paintings sold on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. The average price paid last night was $6099.50 and the 240 pictures brought an aggregate of $885,300, or an average price of $3688.75." Prices in endless  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> lists streamed beyond money to represent the greater abstraction of future value, and generate an aesthetic system from what Veblen identified as a "blending and confusion of the elements of expensiveness and of beauty." Veblen's "pecuniary canon of taste" theorized the Gilded Age impulse to calculate to the penny and by the yard, "Picture Sales: Highest Per Square Inch." It also predicted Jean Baudrillard's "logic of sumptuary values." Baudrillard's witty analogy of an art auction to a poker game in which players bet on exchange values would have resonated with late nineteenth-century audiences who considered the art market an elegant form of gambling. But the more significant links between the two late-capitalist cultures are these: his theory that a bid instantly disconnects the exchange-value and use-value relation from its economic base, and that price has meaning only at the moment of sale. The split between value and price at the Morgan auction prompted some ridicule: "Such prices as $45,500 for the [Jules] Breton [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Communicants</span>]… are simply absurd, if used to base any idea of their true value on." Interest in art auctions, however, led the public to more thoughtful commentary on the slippery position between commodity and fetish. To many, "a painting is a thing of as definite a value as a ton of coal or a tub of butter," wrote a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> columnist. "I never saw a picture that I thought was worth over $10,000 and … whatever they have brought more than this has accrued to the benefit of speculators and dealers," he concluded. To others conscious of a political economy of art, there seemed no "financial equivalent for pleasure."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Complicating matters further was a foreign art tariff that superceded the normal pricing mechanisms of international capitalist exchange and established the government in a privatized market already trading on its own inflation. Exuberant bidding and Gilded Age politicking set into motion the upward price spiral Monet would exploit. Since 1790, the American government had collected a tax on foreign art, varying periodically between ten and thirty percent. But after 1883, when Republicans passed a thirty-percent duty to retaliate against a French ban on American pork, the "contest between the French picture and the American pig" organized public debate over the very nature of goods in an emerging global marketplace. The French pork embargo, supposedly a precaution against trichinosis, was one of numerous European barriers erected in the early-1880s against American incursions into agricultural trade with India and Russia. Impressionism simultaneously interrupted American culture, leading to bemused comment on the porous economies of farmers and painters, eating and looking: "The statesmanlike point of view in France is that the French stomach must be protected from the ravages of the morbid American hog and in this country that the American painter must be protected from the competition and the American looker-on from the unwholesome moral influence of French art."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The tariff would put an end to "hybrid" art produced by painters at once Americans while in Paris and Frenchmen while in New York, wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>. Both their identity and market were "unstable," the second subject to the impulses of "speculative dealers" and "passing tourists." Originality was doomed in a mass market for "pictures that sell for the moment to a class that does not pretend to buy to hold." But the home marketplace was no better. By 1888, the thirty-percent tariff on art imports contributed to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> a precipitous decline in the value of sure bets including Albert Bierstadt landscapes. French dominance and the tariff increase led critics to forego nationalism and posit the real value of American painting in its lower prices. The "great margin for profit" in French and other European paintings ruled the trade, but investments in American paintings yielded higher returns. The distinction between short (foreign) and long-term (domestic) markets was subtle but clear; "though the capital involved is naturally much smaller, the profits would in all probability be larger." Longstanding notions of cultural inferiority might put off a "certain number of investors." For novice buyers, however, the "comparative cheapness of native work" meant an opportunity to trade up: "American work of the best class can be bought by investors with more than a reasonable belief that it will prove profitable should circumstances demand a sale." A dealer quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> returned to the popular land speculation analogy, adding that aside from real estate and stocks, American paintings were the "best property that a man can accumulate." The market promised the rapid appreciation of paintings "you can buy dirt cheap now" but "rich men will bid high for, when you and I have retired."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In other words, American art was a value stock.</p>
<p>The daily press argued the tariff and its politics throughout the late century, contributing to a broad consciousness of global trading and its relation to art economies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>' pro-reductionist position was evident in a reader's comment that "aesthetics and protection simultaneously occupy the New Englander's mind." A stronghold of the Republican Party, the region pointed up arbitrary protariff logic: "Show a New Englander an antique terra cotta lamp … that has lain in the ground for 2000 years, and he will go off in aesthetic ecstatics. Show him the same object as an article of commerce and he at once soberly regards it as a taxable article liable to interfere with home manufactures." The fuller consequence of the tariff manifests itself here, in the market control that established the importance of price in the public mind and also dismantled categories of goods. The intrinsic qualities of things were lost to legislation that grouped paintings with raw materials and food, and set prices of goods according to retaliation and reciprocity. Was the object antiquity, commodity, or both? The answer depended on the way the object was represented, not produced. But who determined that? The state, collector, or public? In 1880, a columnist traced the slippery relation between value and price, made even more arbitrary by state intervention: "Art dealers manage a good deal of hocus pocus to maintain some scale of prices for the paintings of artists who are in the fashion; but nothing is more fictitious or sooner reversible than the value of works of art. Hence it is impossible for Governments to levy taxes on such things, there being no human possibility that officials can be found who are competent to decide upon their value."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>A tariff opponent, the connoisseur and critic James Jackson Jarves described the way government fiat transformed the commodity-state of art in a letter to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>. In 1881, when the duty on paintings was still only ten percent, he cautioned that "arbitrary and illogical" tariff rules defined the value of sculpture, tapestry, and minor arts by material composition. The strategy followed that deployed by Germany in the 1880s to prevent an influx of imported food from America: canned goods were taxed as iron, and hams  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> bagged in linen as fine textiles. Antiquities entering America likewise were "shunted off the free list to the different departments of mere merchandise to which their chief constituent parts are analogous." Bronzes were classed as metal, terra cottas as pottery, each group under "whichever heading will enable the Government to levy the heaviest duty." Tapestries, for example, were subject to a thirty-percent tax if customs officials categorized them by weight with worsted merchandise, or, as Jarves stated, with "stuffs for bodily wear or upholstery." Decorative porcelain was "degraded" to crockery, and thus taxed at the higher rate of household goods. That is, de-aestheticized art objects increased in state revenue value. The processing point at which stuffs became products was the key question argued in the 1882 Tariff Commission debates over the free entry of raw materials, and one reflected in Jarves's statement that foreign fine arts "should be admitted for what they actually are." American art, however, counted as industrial durable goods. In Jarves's estimation, "We have no art that requires protection. Anything that claims to be art and clamors for protection … will be found to be first cousin to manufacture, and should be placed on the same footing."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>"Mr. Havemeyer Paints a Picture" represents the economic circuit joining tariffs, industry, and art [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Drawn from Henry Osborne Havemeyer's combative appearance before the 1899 Congressional Industrial Commission, the cartoon portrays the rotund sugar trust king beside a canvas inscribed with his own testimony, "The mother of all trusts is the customs tariff bill." Infant industry is fed by protectionism, the source of the massive wealth Havemeyer cycled into his preeminent impressionist collection, which included a Monet <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> owned earlier by Berthe Palmer. Language similarly collapsed art and trade. During the 1880s, amidst agitation over the wool tariff, "shoddy," a manufacturing term for cheap wool substitutes made from shredded rags, came into common use among art critics referring to either French Barbizon forgeries or the amorphous "wooly" surfaces of Camille Corot's landscapes. Port cities throughout France planned to establish free "museums" sponsored by American Boards of Trade and the municipalities of Marseilles, Le Havre, and other maritime centers. Their purpose was to exhibit samples of foreign manufactured goods, raw materials, and agricultural products. A display of prices represented inventory too cumbersome for exhibition. The museums were necessary, explained the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>, because the "largest French houses are afraid to trade with America. They have an idea that America is inhabited by savages and is altogether too far out of the way." Art tariff opponents agreed that cultural legislation likewise would reinforce Old World views of the U.S. as inferior and isolated, while perpetuating "our backward arts" and "deformed, abnormal" architecture. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> sharply politicized its criticism by equating the tariff, or "Know Nothingism in art," and mid-century America's virulent nativist movement.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>An informed public followed political wrangling over the tariff during the spring of 1890. A Republican president Benjamin Harrison, and party majorities in the House and Senate, broadly supported William McKinley's bill combining protectionism and reciprocity in a campaign to open the international market to American agricultural and manufactory interests. Expanding the marketplace beyond American borders was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for Republicans an economic and political imperative in 1890, a Congressional election year. An agrarian depression steadily drove their rural constituencies into poverty and toward agrarian radicalism. McKinley's proposal to eliminate the art tariff, and thus induce the French to lift the pork ban, also occurred simultaneously to the American Art Association's national crusade to raise the $34,839 duty on Millet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus,</span> the painting at the center of both bidding and tariff wars. While the Chicago press deplored a revenue system in which the "<span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus</span> is classed with pig-iron and the Venus of Milo with tin-plate," protectionists reminded legislators that after the 1884 art tariff rollback went down in defeat, only seventeen of the fifty two who voted yea were reelected that fall. Boards of Trade in hog and corn-producing states besieged Congress that year, demanding retaliation against luxury goods produced by European nations that "maligned the American hog."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>

<p>For many, the sum of international trade was "cheap food for France and good pictures for the United States." But, French recalcitrance on the pork embargo killed support for "free art," and during the summer of 1890, the Senate Finance Committee returned the "barbarian 30 per cent duty" before striking a final compromise of fifteen percent later that year. Despite widespread notions that all foreign art was taxed in 1890, the law drew a clear distinction between art and its commodity-form on the basis of public and private ownership. Paintings purchased for museums, schools, or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> churches entered free, as did art for public exhibition up to one year. But, as a former Commissioner to the 1876 Centennial and protariff Republican Thomas Donaldson stated in the Philadelphia press, when owners used paintings as "commerce for barter and trade, as silks are, or wines, or iron, or as luxury, they pay duty, as do other commercial commodities or luxuries." Free art was not democratic culture, but social legislation that set the "interest of one class" above the "average citizen." The inequities factored out to the sum of labor's everyday life: "The American workingman returns at night from his toil clad in a woolen suit taxed 55 per cent … a cotton shirt taxed 45 per cent, a woolen hat taxed 75 per cent … He takes up his knife and fork taxed 45 per cent, and begins to eat a piece of salted fish taxed 25 per cent … He ends his meal with a pudding of rice taxed 112 per cent, and an orange taxed 20 per cent."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> The tariff, Donaldson maintained, would stand "rock-ribbed and firm" despite the nonproducing and alien classes determined to open free international art trade: "speculators, foreign governments, foreign ministers, mistaken men, so-called art zealots, long haired men." And, "always New Yorkers."</p>
<p>If American collectors were to profit from free art, why not American producers? That is, if foreign art entered duty free, why not its component materials? Since paintings, like money, had no intrinsic value, the free list should include linseed oils, varnishes, canvas, frames, and gold leaf for their manufacture. At the practical level, current duties on all necessary materials ranging from turpentine to gold leaf slowed productivity at home and placed artists working in America at a disadvantage in the competitive international market. Donaldson's proposal was a page from the central industrial trade debate of 1890, in which the Democratic hardline advocated free raw materials to stabilize the domestic market and boost American manufactory and commercial farming interests abroad.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> He failed to see that the economic distinction between the art-product and its raw state balanced on the cultural difference between high and popular art. Sorting that out was the task confronting the editors and publishers of the illustrated monthly <span style="font-style:italic;">Century Magazine</span>. Before the House Committee of Ways and Means, they challenged the U.S. Treasury Department statute excluding wood blocks prepared for engravings from the roster of finished art. The associate editor Robert Underwood Johnson testified that the educative value of prints justified the free entry of woodblocks engraved abroad for mass reproduction in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Century</span> series "Old Italian Masters." Packaged culture for citizens, however, meant federal revenue for the state. Despite Johnson's protest against classing engravers as artisans (their work was not "mechanical") and the block as raw material ("the art is in it"), the statute stood. By Treasury Department logic, seriality meant commodity, and woodcuts were "simply the means by which an almost unlimited number of impressions constituting pictures could be produced."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>A month later the McKinley Bill captured public attention and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> front page with its contradictory "free art" schedules exempting oil paintings and watercolors as the "professional production of a painter." Artisanal labor was a different story. It allowed for import duties on all forms of mechanical reproduction—lithographs, photographs, and etchings—and a government share in a lucrative mass marketplace. House Democrats  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> eager to make party capital of their own pointed to Republican class legislation: "While the man who has means enough to go abroad to buy pictures is favored, the poor man who desires to ornament his shanty with a foreign colored lithograph will be compelled to pay a tax." Poor man was political shorthand for farmer. And farmers were "hapless creatures" set against "pauper painters" in an "international spectacle." With that, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> let the air out of campaign speeches and flatly stated that hog farmers had no interest in what hung on whose parlor walls. Instead, the farmer was the politician's straw man, spun from the "attributes of that animal which he raises so extensively." The farmer's "violent antipathy" to fine arts and "effeminate compatriots" was election-year humbug, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> declared. "Depraved art" and pork barrels seemed a fair trade. Then again, "hoggishness" might occasion rural protest against "other people's buying pictures when he cannot afford to buy them himself."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>France lifted the American pork ban in December 1891, only to impose prohibitive duties that left farmers in key Republican territories without a foreign market. The free art campaign continued the following year, but this time artist-delegates went to Washington, D.C. as the National Art Association, a lobby organized by the editor Kate Field. When Congressmen disappointed the cause, she won support from the U.S. First Lady Mrs. Benjamin Harrison (Caroline Lavinia Scott), herself a painter. "I saw no reason why my sex should not persevere," Field remarked to the 1892 Committee of Ways and Means. Two years would pass before the tariff ended and Field accepted France's highest honor for service to the arts, the Palmes académique. First, she consolidated Association forces under its officers including past and current presidents of Chicago's Board of Trade and World's Fair Board of Lady Managers respectively, Charles Hutchinson and Berthe Palmer.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Buying Against the Grain</h1>
<p>Representing art and agrarian commodity, Monet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> series was entangled in tariff disputes dividing two groups, American art and industrials supporting the free entry of art versus French industrials and large agriculture closing their market to American wheat. Robert Herbert's critical identification of Monet's images as wheat (not hay) allows us to set Berthe Palmer's purchases between two barriers to global trade in grain, the 1890 McKinley Tariff and the 1892 Méline Tariff.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> By 1891, when Palmer acquired the first of nine <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>, Zola's schoolmaster envisioned French fields "submerged under a food of American wheat" in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, French agricultural profits hit a two-decade low, and big wheat and iron combined in a conservative push for a protective tariff. U.S. House Republicans simultaneously warned that Democratic free trade ideology meant "within ten years great flouring mills would be grinding Indian and Russian wheat on our seaboard." While House subcommittees heard protests against the "Hottentot tax on art," protariff Republicans and the opposition battled over trade barriers to a range of agricultural products, particularly grains. Republicans played to xenophobes, picturing a nation of American farmers "on a level with the Russian, the Indian, the Egyptian." Free trade in barley, oats, and the like would  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> force farmers out of lucrative diversified fields and into one bankable export—wheat. A wheat war would then pit Jefferson's yeoman against his "swarthy competitor, wearing no clothing but a coarse towel, living on rice, and sheltered only by a bamboo hut." The resulting glut in the world market would reduce farm life to subsistence and the farmer to the "peasant serf of Europe and the half-naked ryot of India." As I have suggested elsewhere, Monet profitably created his own laissez faire capitalist market for representations at a moment when protectionism brought trade in the visible supply of grain to a standstill. To foreground the social meaning of Palmer's open trade in Monet's signs for wheat, we may begin with her position as the first American collector to see value in Monet's seriality, and her penchant to flip art "as she and her husband bought and sold real estate."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Palmer was a preeminent society leader, art collector, and philanthropic labor advocate whose patronage extended to the Woman's Trade Union League. She opened her sumptuous gallery to the Chicago Woman's Club reform department in 1910, campaigned to unionize the city's millinery workers, but drew fire from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Socialist</span> for wearing non-union hats. Palmer's activities, everyday and extraordinary, from bargain shopping to a Lusitania crossing, dominated international society pages, which celebrated her as the "only American woman who knows how to spend her money." Born to Southern gentry, she increased her status through marriage to the real estate magnate Potter Palmer, founder of the famed hotel Palmer House. His first fortune, however, derived from the flourishing dry goods business he later sold to Marshall Field. Meant to attract women shoppers, his modern marketing strategies featured luxury goods and imported dresses over everyday stock. Alongside seductive displays, Palmer introduced to women consumers the new opportunity to buy on credit and take purchases home on approval. Berthe Palmer's own business sense led her to nearly double her husband's estate between his death in 1902 and hers in 1916 when her net worth exceeded $15,000,000.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> We can understand how Palmer entered the art-commodity trade, particularly given her husband's stated desire for "pictures he wouldn't lose on," but why the <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>?</p>
<p>During the early 1890s, primarily through Durand-Ruel, Berthe Palmer bought and traded Monet's serial images at a time and place when Chicago Board of Trade speculators "redefined the <span style="font-style:italic;">meaning</span> of grain." We know, for instance, that two canvases she returned to Durand-Ruel, depicting grainstacks in snow, entered the Havemeyer collection in 1894 and 1895.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> As a Chicagoan, Palmer saw that international trade disputes mirrored regional tensions between speculators and grain growers, and mobilized grassroots protest. When she made her purchases in 1891, the U.S. had its largest wheat harvest to date, and the following year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Studio</span> announced the "time for lovers of Monet with small purses has passed." But the Farmers Alliance and its third-party agitation against futures trading also were on the rise. Developed from commodity trade in the late-1860s, futures did not depend on current supplies of physical grain, but the future price of grain yet to be delivered. At stake was the "nature of reality in a speculative economy."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Streams of grain, elevator receipts, futures contracts, and "wind wheat," impressionist grainstacks and Barbizon counterfeits—these were serialities in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> two related speculative worlds that transformed nature through abstract symbols and fictions, and disrupted the marketplace with artificial surplus.</p>
<p>Options trading was a mainspring of agrarian discontent. Unlike futures, options was a largely illegal form of gambling that allowed virtual traders to choose whether or not to make or take delivery of a commodity, depending on market conditions. By the farmer's reckoning, short-selling speculators trading in "phantom" crops did so to drive down the prices of actual harvests. Antioption petitions to Washington, D.C. made plain the agrarian producer's dislocation from a modern market in which "one party agrees to sell what never did and never will exist, and the other agrees to buy what he knows is never to be delivered to him." The aim of options trading, stated opponents, was to "kill off the real article."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Farmers fought back against short-sellers and currency shortages with the Alliance subtreasury plan. Designed in 1889 by Charles Macune, the plan centered on the establishment of government warehouses in counties across the nation that annually produced more than $500,000 in agricultural goods. While waiting for favorable market prices, farmers could store crops in the subtreasuries and borrow up to eighty percent of their current value, issued as government certificates of deposit.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Crop certificates acquired the "character of money" in the populist weekly <span style="font-style:italic;">National Economist</span>, where Alliance supporters contrasted the intrinsic value of corn and the representative value of coin. Money was the "thought of value … a conception and not a commodity," wrote a contributor. Yet others equalized exported crops and money abroad in a continuous stream of representations: "The only difference between gold certificates and the proposed sub treasury certificates is that the former represents gold bullion in our vaults while the latter represents wheat and cotton, that [sic] represents gold coin circulating in Europe."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> When money became a "legal fiction" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Economist</span>, value followed as a "purely relative term" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>. The grain/gold analogy spilled into the daily press, as the Chicago columnist stated, "If a bushel of wheat is exchangeable today for 23 grains of gold and tomorrow can be obtained for 14 grains … the value of the gold has changed relative to the wheat, just as much as the value of wheat has changed relative to gold" [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>].<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Investment capital was thick with grain in the 1890s, thick enough to join and fracture the social economies of speculating and collecting. One of the founders of the original Chicago Board of Trade, Potter Palmer, mastered speculation, but Berthe Palmer manipulated the collection. Hers became a site of profit and critique and a space to aestheticize male commerce performed as open outcry trading so like rivalrous auction bidding. Palmer's own "paper trade" in grain separated product from labor (Monet's and the farmer's), price from value, and commodity from consumption. As Susan Stewart writes, the collection is "not only far removed from contexts of material production; it is also the most abstract of all forms of consumption." This is easily true of speculation. Production in both is displaced by risk, luck and magic, speculation seeking "magical formulas to predict price," and the collection a "magic cycle of self-referential exchange" to fetishize the object. In the trading pit and on the auction stage, prices flow free of goods.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>The similarities that enable us to theorize commodity trading and art collecting as related simulacra already were emerging in nineteenth-century popular thought. Palmer's elite circle could not stop her public comparison to Hetty Robinson Green (both died in 1916) whose mind-boggling $100,000,000 fortune came from capital loans, government bonds, railroad stocks, and Chicago real estate. What fixed the "Witch of Wall Street" in popular imagination, however, were her storied eccentricities. Going about in men's underwear and newspaper petticoats, eating scraps and onions, adopting tenement lodgings and aliases, she dodged the taxman and would-be murderers.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> More importantly, she typed for the public the feminine speculator irrational, as Mary Morgan did the manic collector. As we have seen, business journals today index auction prices as industrials and analyze global reserve contracts alongside global chip sales. Corporate capitalism in 1903 already recognized the "industrial importance" of international art trade, and blurred markets in foreign art and foreign loan sales. Both  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> experienced volatility due to price fixing and hyped potential profits calculated to shop debt to investment consortia and spread out risk: "At the present time there are quotations for pictures as there are quotations on the stock exchange, and this is complicated by fictitious financial operations … People 'launch' a painter as they launch a foreign loan … They buy in his works to prevent a slump in prices. There are 'cracks' and 'booms' and on the bourse—pardon, I mean the salesroom—such and such a painter drops so many points … Bad day for Impressionists … The Monet division felt the bad turn of the market. Degas alone was firm at the conclusion of the day."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>As much as the grain he represented, Monet's seriality positioned Palmer's nine canvases as a commodity-form in a speculative world. His multiples parallel Jefferson's 1785 Land Ordinance, identical one-square-mile sections mapping the democratic space of freeholds and the property lines of real estate. Particularly in Chicago, the "grid turned the prairie into a commodity," and yielded a superabundance of wheat and corn "all held within neatly rectilinear frames."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> series ordered plenitude within Palmer's collection, but control of another kind was the higher stake; and here we must look again at Stewart for whom seriality defines the collection as a "mode of control and containment." The collector, in turn, masters the series by defining its limit.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> If we further understand the collection to "represent experience" as a controlled model, Palmer's patronage becomes a means to compensate for her exclusion from public and male corporate space. In a female interior, the closeted images take on aspects of the fetish. She equalized her "Norman Gothic castle" and the Board's "temple of commerce" through the collector's fantasy [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]. But in its "perfect hermeticism," Palmer's collection sealed itself against labor and history bodied in the 2,000 workers marching just outside against the "Temple of Gambling and Cut-Throatism" [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>].<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>If we consider the series as a lived female experience, we see the full metaphoric power of Palmer's collection. Changing places with things, millionaire widows, unsexed speculators, and unionized stenographers represented three other serialities— money, margin trades, and machines—within and outside exchange economy norms. Organizing the three into a common pathology was the public obsession with serial death surrounding women at the end of the century. The widows of Potter Palmer, Philip Armour, George Pullman, and Marshall Field, collectively Chicago's "Queens of Finance" [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>], were "born commanders," "real society 'bosses,'" according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>. Their "supremacy" derived not from wealth alone but from a self-referential position above "matrimonial rumor." Husbands were decided liabilities in an internal order granting the "single widow" undisputed power over the remarried "widow-bride." When sociologists asked, "What's killing off the Chicago man?" the Board of Health responded with charts and tables predicting an "Adamless Eden, dominated by a masterful race of Amazons." Anxiety at female sexual and economic independence was measured in declining marriage and male birth rates as well as an increase in male deaths. The "total extinction of the male sex" soon would reduce man to a "museum freak to be stared at by the Chicago Amazon who proves her sex fitness for survival." The final reemergence of her "atavistic tendencies" would complete her evolution; and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">as a "race, woman again might rise to that uni-sexual state that somewhere in the past she occupied preeminently to the exclusion of the male type." Little wonder that the press regarded Palmer to be "her own general."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfixed gender positions drove public discourse against women speculators, particularly in 1899 when Lenore Hattie Linblom became the first nominated to the Board of Trade. Sunday sermons on "Gambling with Bread" denounced grain speculation as the "dirtiest gambling of all," but for that reason the Board became guardians of female virtue. "The path of moral rectitude for a woman, even in these days of voting," set her above male commerce and "it is presumably on this ground that the regular board bars women from membership," advised the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>. More to the point, women speculators troubled domestic ideology by gambling on "fluctuating fortunes of May wheat instead of darning the children's stockings or helping them with their lessons." A natural female  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> instinct for speculation, however, was "amply proved by the manner in which women have always speculated about their neighbors' business." Women of means traded from the Exchange galleries open to the public since the 1893 Chicago World's Fair; but class identity destabilized in bucket shops, illegal gambling rooms (some for women only) where patrons could bet on commodity prices without buying into the market. A "motley collection" representing "types of femininity, of both high and low degree," bucket shop women offered an urban spectacle "safer than slumming." Yet reporters warned of other dangers in the "poisonous" shops, the crowds that "infest" them, and the "rotten, disease-laden air" they breathe [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>].<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>Described as a passion, mania, or fever, and likened to an "opium or hasheesh habit," the social pathologies of female speculation were medicalized. Popular theory typed women speculators by premature aging—hollow eyes, wrinkles, crow's feet, sallow skin, and gray hair—leading to "aching hearts and unhappy homes." Over-excited by their trades, women developed nervous ailments including tremens and bulging eyes. Even worse, speculating robbed them of a "calm and untroubled frame of mind calculated for the practice of domestic virtues." Here was the true threat, the "death to sentiment." Like their French sister, the speculating <span style="font-style:italic;">lorette</span>, these traders collapsed male and female identities. First to fall were "social pleasure and distinction, fear, hysteria, the servant-girl question and numberless other luxuries dear to the feminine heart." Masculinized traders took their losses "as indifferently as the nerviest dealer among men." They called out quotations with a "voice like a brakeman," often trading to "support an idle, worthless man who should himself be out in the world earning a living." Gender reversals crossed class lines into the Exchange gallery where delicate women lost the "impulsive character that controls the gentler sex," and coolly signaled their brokers while male traders below "shrieked frantically."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>Through bucket shops, exchange galleries, and brokerage firms, the popular classes and women now invaded a financial world long dominated by men of privilege. Inheritance, investment, and a modern urban work force empowered women with their own money, and reified their challenge to economic order. That was the subversion that "obliterates feminine characteristics." A double slippage from woman to man to woman to machine, female speculators were prosthetics engineered from gender and technologic modernities. Their umbilical connection to the ticker through its tape, its hypnotically streaming quotations, deadened them to "all the finer feelings of their womanhood." An "automatic vampire" that drained women of femininity, the ticker and its eroticized dangers became gendered in early twentieth-century cautions to the male trader to "divorce himself from [its] alluring attractions."<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Opposition to the ticker in the 1890s centered on its potential to democratize the market by telegraphing quotes from the pit to the public in bucket shops across the city. Anxiety at machinic dominance played out again in the late-1990s when cybertrading emerged as a serious threat to Chicago's decidedly male open outcry tradition. The noisy rough-and-tumble of pit "culture," its traders, runners, and clerks, its heart-pounding gains and losses, its face-to-face shouts, gestures, and hand signals, seemed doomed as insiders wondered if adopting a full electronic platform "could be creating a monster."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>In late nineteenth-century Chicago, women representing new technology became victims of its monstrous forms. An estimated fifty stenographers, or "typewriters," some of whom he married, numbered among countless women murdered by the serial killer H. H. Holmes (Herman Webster Mudgett). The 1893 Chicago World's Fair gave rise to both stenography, a modern female occupation, and the "Holmes Castle," a makeshift hotel that concealed behind its battlements the ghastly machines, deadly gases, and electrical systems of a "murder factory." Reduced to ash and dissolved in acid, traces of female corporeality lingered only in articulated skeletons. Simultaneously to mass murder, serial identity reproduced itself through labor mutuality. In 1892, Palmer organized the National Association of Women Stenographers, a health benefits association for 200 members that later grew into the Chicago Business Woman's Club.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>A year after the Fair, the British reformer William T. Stead published <span style="font-style:italic;">If Christ Came to Chicago</span>, his classic exposé of urban vice and corruption. It ends in 1900, and a utopic future including an eight-hour day, free medical care, and skyscraper cooperative housing. Marshall Field donates his store to the public, George Pullman transports convalescents to the lakeshore, and Berthe Palmer governs as mayor. Under her leadership, "millionaires no longer kept their treasures of art to themselves." Chicago's poor now visited its mansions to share in the "picture galleries of the richest millionaires on Prairie Avenue." The law guaranteed public rights to private collections, and the rich who locked their doors were charged with stealing culture from fellow citizens.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Palmer opened her art gallery to industrial labor in 1907, hosting a conference under the auspices of the National Civic Federation. Then the largest of its kind in Chicago history, the meeting crossed classes to include "600 men and women—multimillionaires, capitalists, single taxers, labor leaders, socialists, settlement workers, students, professors, and society leaders … packing house workers, structural iron workers, and brakemen." They gathered to discuss a Chicago branch of the Federation, which claimed its founding principle to be class harmony through capital and labor conciliation. Not only did a complex anti-union machine operate behind the Federation, Chicago monopolists Cyrus McCormick and J. Ogden Armour galvanized its power to break radical labor. The popular press headlined an amusing carnivalesque, "Capital Bearded by Labor in Castle of Mrs. Palmer," de-politicized in frothy scenes of starched shirt fronts and patent leathers mixing with cloth coats and brogans. Above the classes, Palmer "reigned as if by a magic wand" [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>]. In an open letter to Palmer, Mother Jones declared the event "useless," and the Socialist papers bluntly called it "grotesque." The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Socialist</span> ridiculed Palmer's earlier charity ball, and the "hundreds of underpaid clerks and straw bosses [who] left the grand affair determined to defend the 'rich' and the system under which working people are forced to support idlers to the last ditch." Now, workers bitterly observed her "hopes to capture the labor leaders of Chicago and the nation by giving them a pink tea in her beautiful home."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup></p>
<p>We end here as we began, with Chicago's roiling labor economy. Palmer drew the outside in; through her collection she privatized class struggle, first containing commodity and then labor. Never mind the bakers' strike and "boss bakers," police, and workers who bloodied Chicago streets over poisoned bread a week before her labor conference. The question remains, how can we fix Monet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> between the collector's dream and the worker's world? We can't, and there resides the power of open-ended ideology. Monet's place in an American collection floats on Jameson's lyric analysis of impressionist prose. Writing impressionism means writing past ideology, "awakening an alien space beyond it, founding a new and strange heaven and earth."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> represented the strange earth of speculation, its fragments and series, its cyclical economy turning grain into gold and back again through the unending circulation of commodities. When strikes and tariffs emptied stores of value, even bread itself, Monet visualized the alien space beyond consumption [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>]. In today's global market art is an "asset class" comparable to Treasury bonds; and art investment, after the hedge-fund model, is moving beyond speculation to "securitization." That is, shared losses and gains among group investors, including the artist, in which "risks are traded rather than owned." The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>, however, remain a sign for the unreality and exuberance of moneyless transactions. In spring 2007, Sotheby's partnered with GE Money and rolled out its branded MasterCard to initiate credit card purchases at auctions. Among the designs available to elite cardholders was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> stamped into their plastic above the MasterCard logo. Sotheby's since has quietly dropped the program. When the Fall 2008 art auctions flattened in New York City under a global credit crisis and historic federal bailouts, market watchers focused on Sotheby's sale of seventy-one impressionist works as the season's bellwether. There followed the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>Suspended between two gallery walls in an installation photograph of 1915, Vladimir Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Counter-Relief, no. 133</span>  dramatizes the obduracy with which his sculpture has sat with silent agitation at the heart of modern art for almost a century [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Invoked at the First International Dada Fair in 1920, awarded a gold medal at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, engaged in American serial art of the 1960s,<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Tatlin's work has been employed repeatedly within the production of art but rarely addressed on its own terms. The greater part of the artist's most rigorous sculptures and designs now exist only in coarse photographs, which, like the one before us, are slow to disclose the details of their subjects. In what we see here, taut metal cables cross through the center and frontal plane of a bulky mass of metal scraps. Curved and bent pieces of aluminum and iron have been arranged along predominately x-, y-, and z-axes and tip slightly into the gallery space. Even from the single vantage point of the camera's lens, these surfaces present a complex interaction of planes. Along the left side of the large, central sheet of metal, it appears Tatlin has applied several strokes of paint or primer to his object with a bluntness one typically finds in the broad strokes of a house painter testing a swatch of color. Then again it is likely the artist merely found the metal this way. Indeed it is precisely the rawness of these materials in general  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and their utter lack of reference to a subject outside the work that contributes to the common claim that Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs are best understood as works that acknowledge real space.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> No longer in the thrall of a sublimated gaze or fine touch of the artist, these works have been taken off the sculptural pedestal and off the gallery wall to now directly address a physical existence in the world. Yet, along this line, Tatlin's critics have moved no closer to breaking the reticence surrounding these objects. To dwell only upon the immanence of Tatlin's materials to everyday objects of the world misses the demanding orientation of such material elements within the constructed work itself. This observation is no less striking when we consider the political environments in which the artist actively participated: first as a leading re in Russian avant-garde circles preceding the October Revolution, then as an official in the Bolshevik state, and finally as a founding professor of the reorganized Soviet schools of art.</p>

</div>
<p>The following study will address this apparent discrepancy between the radical form of Tatlin's art and his political activity. More precisely, it will address his art <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> a political activity, since it will privilege neither of these terms as a ground for the other. The most original and important work of Tatlin's career spans a period beginning in 1914 when he first began making constructed sculpture and ending approximately in 1932 when he permanently turned to painting comfortable, domestic easel pictures. The period in between is marked by three major phases: constructed sculpture he called Painterly Reliefs, Counter-Reliefs, and Corner Counter-Reliefs produced before 1917; state monuments he both planned himself and supervised of others following his appointment  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to head the Moscow Department of Fine Arts (IZO) in 1918; and finally, prototypes for everyday objects such as stoves and teapots he designed in the '20s while teaching and working at several institutes of art. In what follows I will look broadly at these three periods using primarily the insights available from the work itself but also the words of others with whom Tatlin shared close intellectual and artistic concerns. Of this latter, I will place particular emphasis on the poet Velimir Khlebnikov, who shared a personal working relationship with the artist and, more importantly, whose shifting social theories resonate strongly with the turns in Tatlin's own modes of production. This is to say that what follows will look at Tatlin's art in the period 1914 to 1932 through a strategy of interrelation: that of one phase of production to the next, of objects and words, and of Tatlin's work to his tumultuous social world.</p>
<p>The larger issue for the work of Tatlin and Khlebnikov here concerns collectivity. Against the sense of a collective as an anonymous, homogenous mass of people, the works in question speak to collectivity as a means of strengthening individual expression and resolve. As suggested in Khlebnikov's lines in the epigraph above—from his "supersaga" <span style="font-style:italic;">Zangezi</span> of 1922 (which Tatlin adapted for the stage)<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup>—the poet speaks of a singular "I" as central to realizing the collective "Many." These lines are a first indication of Khlebnikov's peculiar sense of language and mathematics that I will develop in relation to Tatlin's work. Though Tatlin rarely stated his views on the individual/ collection expressly, I offer one such instance as a final point of introduction. Penned in 1919 during his time with the IZO, the following are the first six of seven theses I render here as "The Initiating Unit in Collective Creativity" (the seventh I will quote and discuss later):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1.   The initiating unit is the collector of the energy of the collective, directed towards knowledge and invention.</p></li>
<li><p>2.   The initiating unit serves as a contact between the invention and the creativity of the collective.</p></li>
<li><p>3.   The viability of the collective is confirmed by the number of initiating units distinguished by it.</p></li>
<li><p>4.   The initiating unit is the refraction point of the collective's creativity and brings realization to the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>5.   Art, always being connected with life at the moment of change in the political system (change of the collective-consumer), and being cut off from the collective in the person of the artist, goes through an acute revolution. A revolution strengthens the impulse of invention.</p></li>
<li><p>6.   Invention is always the working out of impulses and desires of the collective and not of the individual.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p>What do these theses tell us? Though more descriptive than analytical and often repetitive, these suggest that Tatlin was at least explicitly attentive to the pressing issue within the new Bolshevik state of defining individual subjectivity in relation to collective society. But this is not to suggest Tatlin speaks exclusively of persons here. Similar to Khlebnikov, Tatlin creates ambiguity over what constitutes an individual by predominately using the word "<span style="font-style:italic;">edinitsa</span>" (the definition of which means variously unit,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mathematical unity, one, individual) and thereby leaves his theses open to describe persons, the units of a numerical system, and, of special interest here, the material units of his sculpture. Yet to extract such a reading from this short piece by no means provides a direct heuristic for his artistic objects. To follow Tatlin's sixth thesis, his statements invite the historian to reexamine the collective "impulses" condensed in the material work. As I track these impulses across the two most critical decades of Tatlin's career, I will argue that his three periods of work formulate three distinct, yet interconnected, propositions on a politics of the individual. But to begin, I turn from the explicit account of individuality in 1919 to the other side of the Revolution, to the grit and grain of <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 133</span>, to another world perhaps, but one not entirely removed from imagining the individual as a "refraction point" of the collective.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Material As Such</h1>
<p>Upon arriving in Paris in the spring of 1914, Tatlin first encountered the results of Picasso and Braque's revolutionary turn to cubist collage in 1912. Before this trip, Tatlin had worked as an icon painter, a sometime sailor, and then, after 1911, an independent artist painting in a manner inflected by recent trends in Western Europe.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> He had studied the paintings of so-called Analytical Cubism in places like the famed collection of Sergei Shchukin in Moscow, but in Paris he saw, amongst other works, Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> arranged on a wall in Picasso's studio on the rue Schoelcher [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>].<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Characteristic of the polysemic play in Picasso's work beginning in the fall of 1912, <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> includes a mesh-silhouette bottle, flat pieces of paper acting as a table and bounding wall, and Picasso's cardboard maquette of <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar</span> , together suggesting a café scene. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar</span> in particular that Yve-Alain Bois has recognized as the first in a series of constructed works by Picasso that enact an arbitrary split between signifier and signified characteristic of a linguistic system of difference, as articulated by Saussure.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span>, for instance, this line of thought would seek to explain how any particular object in the work gains meaning only through the placement, orientation, and number of other objects present. Add one more piece of paper on the table and the bottom edge of the guitar might cease to double as a newspaper; remove the paper of the table itself and the entire work would lose spatial orientation as a café scene. The crucial aspect of Tatlin's encounter with this work was that soon afterwards, on May 10, he exhibited the first of his own constructed sculptures.</p>
<p>Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief ("Bottle")</span> of 1914 reveals his point of departure from Picasso [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Seen here in a photograph pasted and labeled by the artist in 1914–15, Tatlin's work, like <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span>, combines three main elements. In Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> each element is composed of a different material: tin-plate with wire (for the silhouette of a bottle and containing a shoemaker's last), a curved piece of cardboard, and wallpaper. Each object interacts or interlocks with another element, but there is no prevailing system—whether differential or otherwise—that defines the compositional order. Although a sense of illusionism remains in the bottle form of Tatlin's constructed sculpture, the work as a whole does not cohere into a continuous scene nor do the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> elements delimit an illusionistic space, two qualities conceived with the barest means but nonetheless characteristic of Picasso's construction.</p>

</div>
<p>Maria Gough has argued convincingly that the difference between Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> and Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> hinges on a notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>—a vital concept for the Russian and Soviet avant-gardes during the 1910s.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Typically rendered in English as either "facture" or "texture," the Russian word "<span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>" generally denotes the material quality of a work of art, encompassing both the work's final state and the process of its making. <span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span> in this general sense emphasizes the authorial presence of an artist to work materials such as oil paint or stone in a manner that shows the subjective markings of the artist's hand. During the 1910s, however, art theorists and artists began to use <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> to designate specific qualities of materials themselves, distinct from their treatment by an artist. As Gough argues, it is Tatlin's constructed sculpture that fully  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> realizes this new sense of the term. Each individual material element in his "Selections of Materials," as Tatlin also called these works, is used in a manner that does not alter the fundamental state in which he found it. For instance, "Tensile materials such as wire and rope were pulled taut, solid wooden planks were sawn into smaller blocks but never carved."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In short, <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> came to denote what Gough calls "materiological determination" in Tatlin's constructed sculpture, where material itself determines its own qualities within the work. Reversing the common notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, materials in the Counter-Reliefs produce meaning independently of Tatlin's own (minimal) handling or treatment of the objects themselves.</p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span> alone, however, does not fully account for the challenging form of the Counter-Reliefs. While it is clear that the individual elements in Tatlin's constructed sculpture do not participate in the semiotic play one finds with Picasso, the issue of composition is complex. Initially, the materiological determination of each element  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Tatlin's work would seem to re the Counter-Reliefs in the long history of non-composition in the twentieth century. Ranging from Duchamp's readymades to monochromes to seriality in the 1960s, non-compositional strategies have been employed in a variety of ways to minimize the arbitrary decisions made by an artist in producing a work.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> While the notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> would remove some degree of subjectivity from Tatlin's constructed sculpture, these nonetheless are complicated by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> addresses only the motivation of individual units and not their arrangement into a cohesive totality. The first clue to pushing composition a step further appears in Tatlin's decision to display <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> as inverted in 1914–15, situated above a caption for the exhibition <span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Artists—to War Victims</span> that took place soon after Tatlin completed the original work [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Scholars typically illustrate this work with the bottle set on its base, oriented diagonally above wallpaper at bottom right, but Tatlin's decision to paste the bottle with the opposite orientation shows evidence of unease over a latent illusionism.</p>
<p>Following the first Painterly Reliefs of 1914, we can track several subtle, but important, shifts in compositional tactics in the later Counter-Reliefs and then Corner Counter-Reliefs. In another <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief</span> of 1914, pieces of wood, metal, and wallpaper are again arranged on roughly hewn boards [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. Here Tatlin includes a cubist "sickle" (as Malevich would later call this mark) drawn on the wallpaper.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Though abstract in and of itself, this mark alters the nature of the wallpaper on which it is drawn. Wallpaper becomes a ground for the re of the sickle. And as we look to the work as a whole, there is a similar relationship for objects placed upon the wooden board registering as more significant "res" than the wooden "ground" onto which they are attached. In such a relationship, each material element cannot freely assume the independent qualities of its own <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>. In the subsequent Counter-Reliefs of 1915, we find this implicit hierarchy of re/ground approached in a number of ways: using more irregularly shaped objects, joining materials along a horizontal axis (thus avoiding the bound "picture plane" of the Painterly Reliefs), or attaching elements directly to the gallery wall. In each case, however, the problem of hierarchy is only displaced, not directly addressed.</p>
<p>Hierarchy and re/ground are more substantially reworked with Tatlin's introduction of the Corner Counter-Relief, first exhibited at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10: The Last Futurist Exhibition</span> in Petrograd in December 1915. The photograph of <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Counter-Relief, no. 133</span>, discussed above [<a name="1-text" href="#1">1</a>], shows this work installed at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span>, its catalog number "133" visible at the back right. Also visible within the frame are two of the four total pages from a pamphlet Tatlin published on occasion of the exhibition.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The upper page shows a detail photograph of the other Corner Counter-Relief on display, <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 132</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>], and in the bottom page we can discern <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief</span> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. From these installation photographs, one notices several key points about Tatlin's use of materials by the end of 1915. Paper, which is used in nearly all of the Painterly Reliefs, is now relegated to the gallery wall. No longer rendered as a drawing surface, paper is used in two ways: as a textured, fragile surface hanging on the wall and as printed matter.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Further, the system of wires, rope, and pulleys suspending these sculptures between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> gallery walls eliminates the need for a planar support, as the cable in <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 132</span> creates tensile strength and linear contour in space. The bulk of the objects are now fashioned exclusively from either metal or wood, joined by suturing together punctured surfaces with hardware. While I would not go as far as to claim these works dissolve a hierarchy of re/ground, their compositional arrangement now provides greater independence and specificity to the <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of each material. Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs address even the flatness and load-bearing qualities of the gallery wall itself, while engaging the openness within the room by occupying space in midair, calling to mind Tatlin's later statement in 1921, "I can look upon the sky as concrete material."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>The wires and ropes in Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs also achieve a dramatic sense of intersection and crossing through the totality of elements. It is characteristic of Tatlin's entire run of constructed sculptures that the individual materials in each work connect to one another either through overlap or intersection.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The typical mode of linking elements in earlier works like <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> occurs primarily through overlap. But beginning with the Counter-Reliefs and especially in the dramatic manner in which wires pierce the Corner Counter-Reliefs, materials in the later sculptures tend to interpenetrate and intersect one another. Even though this final observation seems a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> simple one, it is of significant import for the overall project. The insistent intersection of individual elements makes clear that units function as a totality, even if brought together according to the properties and qualities of individual materials.</p>

<p>Thus far I have primarily discussed Tatlin's constructed sculptures with respect to Cubism. Although it seems Tatlin's 1914 trip brought upon his sudden change from painting to sculpture, the direction of his work within the medium of sculpture has as much if not more to do with specifically Russian concerns than Picasso's Paris. We might look more closely at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span>. During the preparation of this exhibition, a long-simmering tension between Tatlin and Malevich erupted in a standoff in which both artists and their followers refused to exhibit with the other and split the gallery space between Malevich's "Suprematists" and Tatlin's "Exhibition of Professional Artists." Malevich inaugurated the term "Suprematism" at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span> by hanging his <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span> high in the corner of his gallery, thereby proclaiming truth and necessity in painting by demonstrating its ultimate point of reduction, its zero degree [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>].<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>That Tatlin and Malevich both installed their most ground-breaking new works in the corner of their respective galleries at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span> is no coincidence. In traditional Russian homes, the place between two walls was reserved for icons and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasny Ugol</span>, the "red" or "beautiful" corner, held a revered icon and designated the most important place in the house. We might read Tatlin's placement of the Corner Counter-Reliefs as a move to trump or at least match Malevich's similar placement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span>. Yet, more significantly, Tatlin's reference to traditional Russian icons resonates with a primitivism underlying his works. His initial entry into the Moscow art scene in 1910 had been mediated through Mikhail Larionov and the "Jack of Diamonds" group, whose paintings drew imagery from traditional Russian peasant woodcuts (<span style="font-style:italic;">lubki</span>). Tatlin's were no exception. In 1923, the critic Nikolai Punin would reflect, "The Russian icon had much more profound influence on [Tatlin] than Cézanne or Picasso."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> This claim is provocative, especially as Punin was Tatlin's most ardent critical ally and worked alongside him at the IZO. However, the more telling comparison here between Tatlin and Picasso, I would propose, pertains to their approaches to primitive art in general.</p>
<p>By the time Tatlin arrived in Paris, Parisian artists had been in the thrall of African art for almost a decade.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> As Simon Gikandi has argued of Picasso in particular, the latter's encounter with African art was always, if unconsciously, in the service of visual appropriation and cultural containment. Picasso trod carefully in his dialogue with African masks only later to disavow their centrality to Cubism.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> The primitive operates differently for Tatlin. Picasso had appropriated from a culture completely removed from his own, while Tatlin's relationship to the Russian icon was more conflicted. As an urban Moscovite, his adaptation of rural Russian artistic forms set him in a similar  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> position of taking from a cultural Other; however, it also aligned his art under the same national identity as that Other. His case is perhaps more comparable to Paul Gauguin's religious pictures of Brittany. The subtle move of Tatlin's primitivism into sculptural production, then, integrates the tradition of the Russian icon without doing so iconically. These icons are notable for being surrounded by elaborate frames composed of heterogeneous materials, a fact Tatlin would have known well from his icon-painting apprenticeship as a young man. His constructed sculptures use a related material heterogeneity to transform Picasso's constructed sculpture into a contemporary Russian form. The placement of these works in the corner of galleries makes this transformation all the more explicit.</p>
<p>Another key position in ring Tatlin's exchange with primitivism appears in the linguistic theory of Velimir Khlebnikov. In 1909 Khlebnikov left behind studies in math and science to join a group of Futurist poets in St. Petersburg including David Burliuk, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Aleksandr Kruchenykh. Voldemars Matvejs has described Khlebnikov's "flowering of primitivism" in poems of 1911 as similar in kind to desires for a prehistoric natural world one finds in Larionov or the Parisian <span style="font-style:italic;">douanier</span>, Henri Rousseau.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> But Khlebnikov and his literary circle were also engaged early on in questions of materiality. In 1910 the group published an anthology printed on wallpaper. A few years later in 1913, against the backdrop of a 1912 essay by Burliuk called simply "<span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span>," Khlebnikov co-authored two essays with Kruchenykh, "The Word as Such" and "The Letter as Such," that theorize what might be called a phonic determinism for the individual word and the individual letter.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Without referring explicitly to <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, the first essay anticipates the growing trend towards material specificity in the visual arts by claiming that "Henceforth a work of art could consist of a <span style="font-style:italic;">single word</span>, and simply by a skillful alteration of that word the fullness and expressivity of artistic form might be attained."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> But as Khlebnikov would soon realize, words "as such" were too diverse to securely ground a scaffolding of literary essentialism.</p>
<p>So he turned to "The Letter as Such." Presumably written later in 1913, this essay rebukes those who had adhered too closely to the authors' previous claims about the word: "No one argues any more about the word as such, they even agree with us. But their agreement does no good at all, because all those who are so busy talking after the fact about the word say nothing about the letter. They were all born blind!"<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> In less polemical texts, Khlebnikov would explain that his determinism of the letter rests on a theory that meaning arises directly from individual phonic sounds. He explains, "With <span style="font-style:italic;">m</span> begin names signifying the very smallest members of several sets of things … The <span style="font-style:italic;">v</span> name expresses an act of subtraction … K begins words that deal with death: <span style="font-style:italic;">kolot'</span> [to stab], (<span style="font-style:italic;">po</span>)-<span style="font-style:italic;">koinik</span> [deceased], <span style="font-style:italic;">koika</span> [hospital bed], <span style="font-style:italic;">konets</span> [end]."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> The viability of Khlebnikov's theory is a question I will put to the side. My interest is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">impulse</span> of this theory. Khlebnikov's search for the basic unit of language is akin to Malevich's desire to establish a zero degree in art or the use of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> in Tatlin's art to individualize the material units of his constructed sculpture. Anticipating Tatlin's sculptural project, Khlebnikov had written a warning in "The Word as Such" against illusory uses of materials. Connecting painterly illusion with false testimony, he cautions, "a sermon  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that doesn't derive from the art itself is nothing but wood painted to look like metal. And who would trust a weapon like that?"<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>So what kind of political weapon was <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, then? One indication appears in a statement by Khlebnikov in 1919: "Each individual word resembles a small workers' collective, where the first sound of the word is like the chairman of the collective who directs the whole set of sounds in the word."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The following year Tatlin registered a similar observation: "What happened in '17 in a social sense had been carried out in our fine craft in 1914, when 'material, volume, and construction' were established as a principle."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Khlebnikov and Tatlin were in fact close associates, having first met when Tatlin designed a stage set for Khlebnikov's play <span style="font-style:italic;">Tsar Maximilian</span> in 1911, and one of the few images we have of Tatlin before 1917 is a portrait drawn by the poet. But to follow up on the hindsight of both artists after the October Revolution that <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> had been politically defiant all along, we must look to the interrelation of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, primitivism, and the political discourse on collectivity in the years leading up to 1917.</p>
<p>A recent study by Oleg Kharkhordin titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Collective and the Individual in Russia</span> recasts the common assumption that political initiatives before and after 1917 sought to turn aggregates of individuals into unified masses. While the dialectic of individual and collective has long been a backbone of theoretical debates on Marxism, Kharkhordin's study calls attention to the specific historical moment in which early Bolshevik theory vigorously tested the positions of these debates to find a viable means of realizing the full potential of individuals in a collective society.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> The term "collective" (from the Russian <span style="font-style:italic;">kollektiv</span>) was coined in the first decade of the twentieth century by social psychologists seeking to describe a new phenomenon observed after the first Russian Revolution of 1905 in which groups spontaneously gathered in public, be they crowds or armed forces.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Following its psychological inception, a notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">kollektiv</span> then migrated into Bolshevik state planning. One leading re in this arena was Anatolii Lunacharsky, Commissar of Enlightenment for the Soviet state and, in this capacity, Tatlin's superior when he worked for the IZO. Along with Maxim Gorky, Lunacharsky had first addressed the issue of collectivity through a notion of "God-building." Following the return to power of Tsar Nicholas II after the uprisings of 1905, they published "Essays on the Philosophy of Collectivism" in 1907, arguing that Marxism and collectivism should be adopted as a new religion to bind together the proletariat. This "God-building," however, promoted collective formation by placing one's faith in the predetermined ideas of central leaders and therefore proved too similar to the social orders Lunacharsky was himself attacking. To address this problem, Bolshevik thinkers increasingly turned in the 1910s to cultivating <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span>, meaning the unique qualities of persons and their potential for action in everyday life. Following the October Revolution and his appointment to Commissar, Lunacharsky wrote "The Basic Principles of the United Labor School" in 1918 which stresses the importance of state planning that would cultivate <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span> without repeating the egoism of bourgeois individuality. "[Socialist education] does not harness individualization …," he wrote, but rather "the individual [<span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span>] remains the highest value of socialist culture. This individual can develop all its endowments only in a harmonic and solidary society of equals."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For Tatlin's constructed sculptures within the social imagination of the 1910s, these 121 works can be read as a map for staking out a new relationship between individuals and their formation in collectives. Bringing together the two significant strains of development in Tatlin's sculpture after 1914—the negotiation of hierarchy amongst individual parts and the aggressive intersection of these materials to create a single form—the social insight in the constructed sculpture, and particularly the Corner Counter-Reliefs, displays how a new collective form might emerge from the <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of different materials uniquely arranged.</p>
<p>Thus <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> in Tatlin's work, like phonic determinism for Khlebnikov, captures how singularities might come together in an integrated and total form without diminishing the uniqueness of each individual member. In line with the investment in <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span> emerging during the 1910s, we might conclude that Bolshevik intellectuals increasingly came to view collectivity as a <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of persons: a political formation generated by its individual members and empowered through the conjunction of these singularities. Nevertheless, to speak of empowerment among individuals in a collective steps beyond the determinism, which marks the projects of both Tatlin and Khlebnikov before the Revolution. There is no positive force between Tatlin's materials or Khlebnikov's phonic sounds, as the meaning of these individual parts must be established a priori. This is a problem Tatlin's art would take up after 1917: a search for a theory of individual and collective <span style="font-style:italic;">in process</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The First Monument Without a Beard</h1>
<p>When revolution broke out in 1917, Tatlin ceased making constructed sculpture. He remained in Moscow and in 1918 took up his post as head of Moscow's division of the IZO. In this capacity, he was charged by Lunacharsky with carrying out Lenin's plan to replace Russia's old monumental sculpture with works appropriate to the new state's socialist aims. Tatlin's most famous contribution to the IZO, however, was not the structures he oversaw but his personal submission, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monument to the Third International</span> [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>].</p>
<p>Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monument</span> is often called, has quite a remarkable design. It was to be enormous and dwarf the Eiffel Tower in height. Yet Tatlin's plans to realize such a towering monument never moved beyond a few drawings and a model of about three meters exhibited at the Eighth Soviet Congress on November 8, 1920. He never indicated how such a large structure would or even could be built. He did propose how the completed <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> would function. It would house the administrative body of the Comintern in four glass structures suspended within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s open lattice frame. According to a 1921 essay by Punin, the lowest hall would be shaped as a cube and house the legislative body, the next level a pyramid and house executive functions, the third level a cylinder and house information centers, and the final level a half-sphere and broadcast a radio signal. In addition, each level would rotate at a different speed: the cube completing a single rotation annually, the pyramid monthly, and the cylinder daily.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> looms large in the history of modern art, historical accounts generally reiterate the arguments provided by Punin in 1921. He proclaimed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s revolutionary importance on three counts: first, it would be a functional structure as the center of operations for the Comintern; second, it would maintain a truth to modern materials by using only metal for its structure and glass to demarcate interior spaces; and third, its dynamic spiraling lines and tilted orientation would provide a vital symbol of the Revolution.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Tatlin originally planned to dedicate his monument to the October Revolution, but within a year it was re-dedicated to the Comintern. Yet whether nominally assigned to the Revolution or the Comintern, the structure Mayakovsky called "the first monument without a beard" was conceived under the auspices of Lenin's 1918 plan and I propose that its social efficacy is best understood in relation to this program.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>In a sharp turn of events that characterized the experience of many, Tatlin's appointment to the IZO transformed him from radical outsider in his field to one of its central administrators. He was responsible for seeing through multiple criteria in Lenin's plan, including stipulations to remove Tsarist works, to mobilize and organize  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> artists, and most importantly, to work quickly. In a memorandum written in May 1918, Tatlin described the nature of the task as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Monuments should be erected in boulevards, public gardens and the like in all districts of Moscow, with quotations or maxims engraved on the pedestals or surroundings, so that these monuments should appear like street rostra from which living words should fly to the mass of the people, stimulating minds and consciousness of thought.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Yet a look at the type of work to which Tatlin refers reveals a stark difference between the tone of this letter and the projects he administered.</p>
<p>In a photograph taken on November 7, 1918 [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>], we see the unveiling of one such work, an over-life size monument of Karl Marx by the sculptor Aleksandr Matveev. This is a typical monument in two senses: it is a prime example of the vast majority of monuments produced under Lenin's program, but also, it demonstrates the common social function of monuments as characterized by the scholar James Young. Drawing from Young's analysis of Holocaust monuments in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Texture of Memory</span>, this statue of Marx might be described as "unabashedly rative, heroic, and referential."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Matveev's monument is also situated in a public plaza, of which Young writes, "memorials provide the sites where groups of people gather to create a common past for themselves, places where they tell the constitutive narratives, their 'shared' stories of the past."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Bolsheviks astutely realized that a new government sustains legitimacy only if its claim to power is provided a history in the popular imagination. Therefore they also employed a parallel strategy of re-inscribing existing statues. In 1918, for instance, the names of Marx, Engels, Campanella, Winstanley, Thomas Moore, Saint Simon, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Plekhanov were carved onto an Imperial obelisk in Petrograd, effectively overwriting that city's physical traces of memory.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The monument Tatlin contributed to Lenin's plan looks nothing like those designed by Matveev and others. It also functions differently regarding memory. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> is not an object linking past to present, but rather, one linking present to future. Although Tatlin's decision to switch the memorial attribution of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> from the Revolution to the Comintern may well have been a bureaucratic matter of timing and deadlines, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> suits both as an object carrying forth the international revolution. Conceiving revolution as a continuous process and the Comintern as its living body, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> articulates the forward march of both entities through its constant and differentiated layers of motion. Its orientation to ongoing events of the present and future is made more explicit still in its status as a model for a monument. The difficulty of realizing Tatlin's design—or more accurately, we might say the impossibility, circa 1920—assigned his monument a life of potentiality. It never obtained a physical site amidst a community, but thrived as an <span style="font-style:italic;">idea</span> of a monument available to myriad communities. In 1925, Tatlin built a second model for the Soviet pavilion at the International Exhibition in Paris, as mentioned above. That same year, another, simplified version of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> was built (presumably not by Tatlin) for a May Day parade float. Though any object has the potential to be inscribed into new situations over time, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> addresses its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> own condition as open-ended and thus inverts the myth of stabilizing time and place that characterizes typical monuments of heroic res.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s inversion of heroic individuality thus brings us back to Tatlin's essay on the "Initiating Unit," from which we might now consider its final thesis:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>7. The world of numbers, as the nearest to the architectonics of art, gives us: 1) confirmation of the existence of the inventor; 2) a complete organic connection of the unit with the collective numeral. There is no error in Khlebnikov's example. 1) "In a series of natural numbers, prime numbers, indivisible and non-recurring, are scattered. Each of these numbers carries with it its new numerical world. From this it follows that among numbers too there are inventors." 2) "If we take the principle of addition, and add one more to a thousand units, the arrival and departure of this unit will be unnoticed. If we take the principle of multiplication, then a positive singular multiplied by a thousand makes the entire thousand positive."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here Tatlin claims the initiating unit is not only essential for collective activity, but 125 in fact energizes the many. I invoked Tatlin's first six theses earlier as an initial rubric for considering the collective formation of material units in his sculpture of the teens, but the energy of the "initiating unit" to concretize <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> to set the collective in motion moves beyond the additive logic of collage and <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> to that of multiplication. Though suggestive of the earlier work, the particular model of individual/collective in the seven theses as a whole firmly describes Tatlin's work after 1917. I would argue the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> expresses this move towards a generative notion of individualism—a unique singularity, constantly moving and being reinvented, and connected with a changing global community. In other words, as situated within Lenin's monument project, Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> represents the individual without depicting a specific, historic person. It enacts the <span style="font-style:italic;">relation</span> of the revolutionary individual to the collective. Yet to fully understand this claim, we must return the re of Khlebnikov lingering in Tatlin's final thesis.</p>
<p>Between 1915 and his untimely death from illness in 1922, Khlebnikov's ideas became increasingly complex and provocatively strange. He continued to theorize language, but this project shifted from attempting to locate an Archimedean point in phonetics to expanding this search to numerical ratios. He created various self-appellations, calling himself at one time or another Martian, President of the Planet Earth, King of Time, and of special note here, founder of the Society of 317.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Khlebnikov imagined his society would include 317 scientists, writers, and artists creating a government of time to replace the historical function of the state to govern space. Though founded in February 1916, the Society remained one of his many unrealized projects. 317 itself nonetheless serves an important role in his social theories. Based on his estimate for the median number of human heartbeats a day when multiplied by 365,<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> the number 317 was applied to find (or, more properly, invent) recurring ratios in the history of civilizations:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>If we conceive of all mankind as a string, then the most diligent and thorough study reveals that there is an interval of 317 years between soundings of the string … We observe that the Napoleonic Code came into existence 317 x 4 years after the Code of Justinian (A.D. 533). That two empires—the German and the Roman—were founded 317 x 6 years apart: Germany in 1871, Rome in 31 B.C.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Khlebnikov offered similar arguments for the human body and labor market, calling heartbeats "the monetary units of the future, in which all individuals are equally wealthy."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Such a conception of history—no matter how creative in its calculations— was not a strategy to diminish the importance of historical change. Khlebnikov sought constant ratios in human history as a means of finding rationality in the seemingly random patterns by which societies form and disband. All of this staged, of course, against Russia's own impending upheaval. After 1917, Khlebnikov dedicated himself more ardently to enacting his social plans by lecturing to soldiers on the southern front and codifying (while further complicating) his numerical ratios in a final unfinished work, The Tables of Destiny.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Throughout Khlebnikov's struggle to ground a politics of unification, the role of the individual remained central. As he describes, "We must divide up humanity into inventor/explorers and all the rest. A class of farseeing visionaries."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> These "inventor/ explorers" strike a distinct harmony with Tatlin's initiating unit, and likewise, Tatlin's reference to Khlebnikov in his seventh thesis stems directly from the latter's theory of historical ratios. Tatlin's individual that makes the "entire thousand positive" evokes a reciprocal relationship by which a single entity embodies the many and in turn engages, creates, and therefore constantly remakes the unity of the whole. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, in turn, actualizes this vision not only by the fact that it would literally embody international workers for the proliferation of communism but also by its important function as a communications center.</p>
<p>The fact that Tatlin's proposed structure would broadcast a radio signal coincides with one of Khlebnikov's best-known proposals for harnessing the universal, if invisible, signals of the universe. In "The Radio of the Future" of 1921, an essay he originally titled "The ROSTA of the Future" (changed posthumously in 1927),<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> there are three main points that recommend Khlebnikov's argument to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>. First, he addresses the radio as a technology that will literally bring people together in "Radioauditoriums." Here describes a potential music broadcast: "The entire settlement has gathered around to listen … The metal trumpet mouth loudly carries the news of the day, the activities of the government, weather information, events from the exciting life of the capital cities."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> So at its most simplistic level, radio acts as a conduit for collecting crowds. Beyond this, radio also unites the minds of those listening and those broadcasting. A radio signal is present everywhere and at all times. Like Lenin's drive to spread electricity to the entire USSR in the 1920s, Khlebnikov described radio as a means to collapse the vast spaces of separation between rural populations and urban life. He describes a potential music broadcast as follows: "The Mussorgsky of the future is giving a coast-to-coast concert of his work, using the Radio apparatus to create a vast concert hall … On this one evening he bewitches the people, sharing with them the communion of his soul."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Similar to Lenin's famous dictum "Communism equals Soviet power plus electrification of the entire country," Khlebnikov conceived radio signals as saturating the very material of the nation and thereby concretizing the connections among members of diverse communities. The third aspect of Khlebnikov's approach to radio is a consequence of the first two. Once the populace is connected by radio, both externally and internally, by body and mind, the signal will transform processes of thought and perception. As he explains, "Every settlement will have listening devices and metallic voices to serve one sense, metallic eyes to serve the other. Finally, we will have learned to transmit the sense of taste—and every simple, plain but healthful meal can be transformed by means of taste-dreams carried by Radio rays, creating the illusion of a totally different taste sensation."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> It is lines like these that might lead one to read Khlebnikov's radio essay as a precursor to theories of media society, which is especially tempting when he claims in another section that radio signals also transmit visual rays (akin to television). Yet there is a fundamental difference between Khlebnikov's radio society and postwar critiques of spectacle and technological saturation. Rather than totalizing its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> collective users, this imagined radio society must be understood as yet another case of empowering and engraining the "inventor/explorer" in the collective.</p>
<p>In sum, the radio appears as one of the many terms through which we can track a dialogue between Khlebnikov and Tatlin until the former's death in 1922. Regarding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, it fascinates that in 1915–16 Khlebnikov wrote of "[Building] apartment houses in the form of steel frameworks, into which could be inserted transportable glass dwelling units." And further, "[Erecting] portable moving monuments on the platforms of trains."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> But I would not claim Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> is derivative of Khlebnikov's bold social propositions, or vice versa. The work of both engaged similar issues and used the available means of their respective mediums to define singular but deeply interrelated responses. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> realizes various and even conflicting aspects of Tatlin's and Khlebnikov's theories of the individual, as befits its status as a potential monument, designed for a potential community. It is only appropriate, then, that in 1924 Tatlin proposed the national monument to Lenin should include "everything that characterizes our late leader as an innovator and revolutionary … 200–300 telephones for the use of visitors … a huge auditorium … an information office to let the world know of events in the Soviet republic … a powerful radio and so on."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, this structure would memorialize aspects of the leader—his electricity plan, his leadership, his social vision—without mimetically representing the man himself. If Tatlin's constructed sculptures of 1914–17 had worked through the problem of how entities might be unified and self-sufficient within an aggregate structure, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> isolates and explores the individual unit. Opening outwards from the internal generation of meaning in <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> operates on a dynamic relation between individuals and their collective formation. It was a model of dynamism, however, that soon began folding inwards.</p>
<h2 class="sec-headB">Objects for the Individual</h2>
<p>Unlike Tatlin's constructed sculptures, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> was a singular endeavor. Though he engaged with several projects during the period he created the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> model, after 1920 Tatlin shifted efforts almost exclusively to designing objects for everyday use, including clothing, household tools, and furniture.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> He founded the Section for Material Culture in the Petrograd Museum of Artistic Culture in 1919, and in 1923 the Museum was reorganized into the Institute of Artistic Culture (GINKhUK). He later participated in the reorganization of the Higher Artistic and Technical Studios (VKhUTEMAS) in Moscow and taught there as a professor in the Faculties of Wood, Metal Working, and Ceramics until the independent institutes of art were consolidated in 1932 as the Union of Soviet Artists.</p>
<p>Tatlin's work on everyday objects presents a paradoxical withdrawal. In the name of working for the individual Soviet citizen, his artistic project shifts from enacting an experimental politics of individual and collective to catering literally to individual, everyday needs. In 1923, he describes his goals at GINKhUK as follows: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The main task of the Section is material culture. The work of the Section is purely practical and is the continuation of the work on material culture carried out by V. E. Tatlin since 1913… The determination of new methods and types of utilization of materials in the construction of objects for everyday life.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is significant, if unsurprising, that Tatlin contends his new research continues the objectives of the old. Certainly he remained fascinated by the nature of materials (<span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>), but the manifestation of this interest in his works remained strongly red by the cultural conditions of their making. For any conclusion to Tatlin's art in the period 1914–32, one must account for the dramatic changes in his modes of production.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> These might easily fall into the narrative structure of a rise and fall. A problem is defined in the teens, a provisional solution is formulated, this solution becomes more sophisticated in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, and then gradually dissipates in the 1920s. Such a simplification, however, would not take seriously the complex position of Tatlin's artistic practice to the pressing claims of a social sphere that was dramatically on the move during the two decades in question. Therefore, I will bring my discussion of the individual/collective in Tatlin's work to a close by considering his objects of the 1920s with regard to the vicissitudes of his public life as an artist.</p>
<p>For Soviet art we know as Constructivism, the 1920s signaled a turn from a laboratory phase of experiments with artistic form in 1920–21 to a production phase beginning in 1921 that pushed these experiments into practice.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Though Tatlin was never a member of the Working Group of Constructivists that carried out the most rigorous of these experiments, on occasion he is erroneously included in histories with the Constructivists and particularly since he incorrectly claimed in 1929 to be their founder.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> While not a Constructivist per se, Tatlin nonetheless did attempt to participate in production. In 1922, he founded a design studio at the Novyi Lessner metalworking factory, joining Varvara Stepanova, Liubov' Popova, and Karl Ioganson as the only Russian artists known to have engaged in the processes of mass production from within factory walls.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> Tatlin's plans for Novyi Lessner, however, were not accepted by the metalworkers. Even though he would continue to design objects for mass production, not a single one ever rolled off an assembly line.</p>
<p>On the face of things, Tatlin's designs for everyday objects fall into two groups: fluid, organic forms and stark, geometric ones. The first pole is exemplified by the sinuous lines of his 1923 sleigh frames, while the second in his design for a man's overcoat [<a name="9-text" href="#9">. 9</a> and <a name="0-text" href="#0">10</a>]. The flowing curves of this sled seem to correspond keenly to the dynamism of its rider rushing through space, matching the form of the object to the experience of its user. In contrast, the coat appears awkward in Tatlin's drawing of "Utility Clothing," like a foreign-object thrust upon the depicted re. In spite of these apparent differences, however, an article published in the popular magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaia panorama</span> (Red Panorama) in 1924 suggests a similar grounding for all of Tatlin's everyday objects.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Among several illustrations, there are two depictions of Tatlin's overcoat: one of the artist modeling a prototype and another showing pattern pieces for making the coat oneself. Between these two depictions, there exists a sharp contrast between the artist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">appearing as a near automaton while wearing the overcoat himself and a great deal of irregularity in the patterns that would be used to produce this highly regular object. As scholars have noted, his patterns do not follow regular, geometric schema and were perhaps better suited to handcraft.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In addition, we also learn the practical virtues of Tatlin's coat design from the text in <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaia panorama</span>: its wide cut tapering at the knees contains heat, prevents fabric clinging to the body, and thereby maintains air circulation between body and coat. The text (probably by Tatlin himself) even asserts that the placement of the coat's pockets helps to maintain proper posture. Thus despite its ponderous appearance, Tatlin's design arises from and caters to the organic form of the human body. This insight applies to all Tatlin's everyday objects. Whether in the winding curves of a sled frame, staid articles of clothing, bentwood chairs measured to the skeleton of the human body, simple proportioned planks of a wooden bench, or even his would-be flying bicycle,<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> Tatlin's everyday objects reiterate a closed circle.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> They are objects made <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> the individual worker and conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">from</span> the literal contours of the human body.</p>
<p>Throughout this essay I have tracked the ongoing dialogue in the art of Vladimir Tatlin with imagining and implementing collectivity in Russia. As one can see, his everyday objects of the 1920s do not break completely with the central question of individuality that informs both the constructed sculpture and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>. But in literally making objects for individuals, Tatlin nonetheless left behind the more complex project of examining the relations of individuality and collectivity so crucial to the previous work. This thread of continuity would disappear completely after 1932, when Tatlin abandoned critical practice entirely by retiring to painting still lifes and nudes. The conclusion to his art, however, should not be seen as a denigration of some personal failing. In 1922 he had lost a vital interlocutor in Khlebnikov and the turn to production never returned much by way of real opportunities or ideas to the artist. In the midst of conflicted circumstances in which Lenin's New Economic Plan (1921–28) expanded economic interaction on a semi-free market while Stalin's rise to power forcefully contracted public interaction on a number of levels, Tatlin's art turned inward. These circumstances in fact highlight the precise value of his practice. Tatlin was not the kind of artist to who produced singular solutions while working in near solitude. His work depended and occasionally thrived on the exchanges available in public culture at large. The collective work of 1914–32 leaves us with little about Tatlin as an individual and instead with a few openings upon individuality in the worlds it negotiated.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f29" href="#f29-text">29. </a>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Theories of Surplus Value</span>, Marx writes, "although at first the development of the human species takes place at the cost of the majority of human individuals and even classes, in the end it breaks through this contradiction and coincides with the development of the individual." Vol. II, ed. S. Ryazanskaya, trans. Renate Simpson (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1969–1972), ch. ix. Though Marx charted a broad development that would restore power to the individual from alienating social institutions in such works as the above text and <span style="font-style:italic;">The German Ideology</span>, his legacy left questions as to how these changes were to be realized on the level of everyday action. See Lescek Kolakowski's account of these debates during the Second International (1889–1914) and particularly the split over the role of institutions between anarchists and traditional socialists in "Marxism and the Second International," <span style="font-style:italic;">Main Currents of Marxism: Its Rise, Growth, and Dissolution</span>, vol.

A notable exception to Punin's argument in the literature on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> appears in Annette Michelson's "Introduction" to her edited volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov</span>, trans. Kevin O'Brien (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1984), especially xxx–xxxv, where she describes the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s structure as dialectical: "This open and inclusive structure, polyfunctional in design; revolving simultaneously at different speeds … ; combining cube, cylinder, and sphere; and uniting the supreme legislative, executive, and cultural agencies proposed thereby the kinetic celebration of the triadic structure of the Dialectic." Thus for Michelson in this short but provocative account, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s "counterpoint, polyvalence, and circularity <span style="font-style:italic;">literalize</span> the notion of Revolution" (xxxiii–xxxv). A contemporary difference of opinion is also offered by El Lissitzky in a letter to Malevich dated December 21, 1920, in this case nettling the design of an opponent: "I nevertheless called on everyone to criticize and analyze the construction, demonstrating that the synthesis of painting, sculpture, and architecture is self-deception, that its synthesis with utilitarianism is a childish lack of consideration and fiction, that the relationship with the material is pernicious, that the construction is aesthetic and artistic, and not creative (dismantled, I saw that the model can stand without the spiral, it wears it like a general wears the order of St. Andrew)."

With this final work in particular, I would point to the importance of Dmitri Mendeleev's 1864 creation of the Periodic Table of Elements as a model for Khlebnikov throughout his life.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f54" href="#f54-text">54. </a>Of the few scholars to trace threads of continuity in Tatlin's work from the 1910s to the 1920s, I would note here Christina Kiaer's chapter "Everyday Objects," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions: The Socialist Objects of Russian Constructivism</span> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005), 42–87. Here Kiaer follows Tatlin's primitivism into the objects for everyday life. For a discussion exclusively of Tatlin's design work in the 1920s, see Laurel Fredrickson, "Vision and Material Practice: Vladimir Tatlin and the Design of Everyday Objects," <span style="font-style:italic;">Design Issues</span> 15, no.1 (Spring 1999): 49–74.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f57" href="#f57-text">57. </a>Here I am excepting the widespread production of posters. For a discussion of one notable case of poster production in Soviet advertising, see Christina Kiaer, "Constructivist Advertising and Bolshevik Business," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions</span>, 143–97, and on Stepanova and Popova, "The Constructivist Flapper Dress" in the same text, 89–141.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>As by far the least practical of Tatlin's designs for everyday life, his flying-machine, called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letatlin</span> and completed in prototype in 1932, would seem to inhabit its own sub-category of his everyday objects. While still apart of Tatlin's larger project to provide modern goods for single individuals, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letatlin</span> is tied to larger modern fantasies of flight and therefore raises questions beyond the available space of the present investigation. See comments by Tatlin in Zhadova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 309–11.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>Writing in 1929, Tatlin would claim of chair designs: "A contemporary furniture factory takes no account of the requirements of the human body in constructing any kind of pattern for furniture. It is interested only in external effect. But a human is an organic being, consisting of a skeleton, nerves and muscles."

<div id="body">
<p>In 1962 Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg ended a seven-year relationship. While together, they had exhibited a cerebral wit and an openness to popular culture that distinguished them from other young New York artists. They were in such sympathy that Johns recalls making pieces later sold under Rauschenberg's name.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Now their artistic developments diverged almost immediately. In September 1962 Johns's ex visited Andy Warhol's studio. Warhol had just begun employing silk screen. This efficient means of transferring photographic images to canvas made a deep impression on Rauschenberg. By October, he was also using the process. Down to the present day, he has remained fascinated by the superimposition of mechanically- or chemically-reproduced images flush with the plane of their support.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns visited Warhol's studio in November. Johns, Warhol recalled, "didn't look too thrilled."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> He later claimed that Johns disliked his art because he was too "swish."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Johns, though, almost certainly found Warhol's silk screens unexciting for aesthetic reasons, too. He had already embarked on a new project that eschewed photography, mechanization, and cool irony. From 1962 to 1963, he produced a series of pieces that meditate on the life and verse of the modernist poet Hart Crane (1899–1932): the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage, Diver, Land's End</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>; the drawings <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled (Periscope)</span>; and the lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>. These artworks are defiantly hand-made. All but <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, the earliest, feature handprints, apparently the result of pressing his own hand directly onto the works' surfaces. They all employ many of the painterly techniques identified with 1940s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and 50s Abstract Expressionism: vigorous visible brushwork, an indifference to spills and smears, and a thick uneven layering of paint. Early critics such as Alan Solomon marveled at the tumultuous emotion expressed in the Crane series,<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> and Johns himself awkwardly drew attention to it in a 1963 interview: "It seems to me that the effect of the more recent work is that it is more related to feeling or emotion or … (pause) … Let's say emotional or erotic content."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Much recent writing posits a connection between Johns's break up and his decision to look to Crane for inspiration.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Jill Johnston has made the most convincing case. She cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Johns saw the torments of his personal life mirrored in Crane's. In the same year Johns painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, his first Crane homage, he also turned thirty-two, the age at which the poet jumped to his death from the cruise liner <span style="font-style:italic;">Orizaba</span>.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> She also points to elements of the Crane paintings, such as the upthrust hand in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and the inverted central re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, which suggest identification between the unhappy artist and the suicidal poet.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Johns, she concludes, "appears to be crying for help" even as he seeks "solace and fellowship" by "[c]ommuning with Crane."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Despair alone, however, cannot explain the Crane series. Johns could have chosen many means of expressing angst. Why Hart Crane? And why, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, memorialize the poet in oil, with noticeably Abstract Expressionist handling of paint? In the 1950s, in works such <span style="font-style:italic;">False Start, Painting with Two Balls</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Thermometer</span>, Johns had satirized prevailing assumptions among New York School artists, especially their unreflective equation between bold gestures, thick applications of paint, machismo, and authenticity. Why would he resurrect many of these discredited techniques not to mock but to honor a writer famous for splashy excess?</p>
<p>These are not idle questions. Johns's flags, targets, and beer cans feature prominently in accounts of postmodernism's emergence, pre-histories of Pop Art, and tales of conceptualism's rise. He typically comes across as a stern philosophical thinker scornful of sentimentality and mysticism. While many feminist and queer reassessments since Moira Roth's "The Aesthetic of Indifference"  have challenged this image, they have not entirely unseated it.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The tendency has been to "deploy a mixture of biographical and iconographic analysis" and reveal that his artworks are "confessional texts which speak of their maker's gay subjectivity in hidden or coded language." The aim has been to make "gay subjects belatedly present, both to the contemporary viewer of the works of art in question, as well as within the disciplinary narratives of the art historical record."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Critics have not yet pondered whether Johns's inquiries into queer affect undermine instead of supplement disciplinary narratives. Nor have they asked what reasons other than sexuality might motivate his interest in Crane. Johns, this article shows, turns to Crane at a critical juncture, when his analysis of isolated icons and symbols was giving way to a broader investigation into language's rhetorical capacities. The poet helps him rethink artistic agency at a time when rivals such as Warhol and Rauschenberg were beginning to espouse mechanistic conceptions of artistic production. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Booking</h1>
<p>A straightforwardly biographical explanation for Johns's attraction to Crane is plausible. After his suicide in 1932, Crane became a mythic re in U.S. gay culture, particularly among urban homosexual literati. This pre-Stonewall oral culture may be impossible to reconstruct accurately, but in the 1950s and 60s, a young gay artist like Johns could have learned about and come to identify with Crane without ever having read a single line of his verse.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Similarly, for educated gay viewers, a painting titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> would have had "queer significance" despite its lack of obvious homoerotic content.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>While true, <span style="font-style:italic;">sans</span> elaboration such a scenario underestimates the demands that Johns places on himself and his viewers. He was part of a mid-century group of res that, in reaction to modernist dictates about the purity and autonomy of each art form, began exploring intersections and exchanges between the arts. In the 1950s, venues such as Black Mountain College, the Club in New York, and San Francisco's North Beach encouraged a lively congress of poets, musicians, painters, dancers, and sculptors. Characteristic of the era were multimedia works such as Allan Kaprow's Happenings, Jack Kerouac's jazz-accompanied poetry, and Larry Rivers's and Frank O'Hara's collaborative lithograph piece <span style="font-style:italic;">Stones</span>. Johns himself, along with Rauschenberg, designed sets and costumes for Merce Cunningham's dances.</p>
<p>In such a setting, the vocabularies and concepts developed to apply to particular art forms no longer seem fixed or inevitable. "Many of us," Johns recalls, "felt that ideas in one medium could trigger ideas in another medium—and that media could be mixed new ways."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> He has particularly favored the borderlands between the visual arts and the arts of the written word for his own intermedia forays. Michael Crichton declares Johns a man with an "omnivorous taste for literature," and Deborah Solomon reports that "he reads everything from Wittgenstein to dime store novels."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> His interviews further demonstrate his surprisingly broad literacy. In addition to numerous remarks about Samuel Beckett, Hart Crane, and Frank O'Hara, he also mentions John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, Paul Celan, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Herman Melville, James Merrill, E.A. Robinson, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, and Anne Waldman.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The frequent appearance of poets in this list is no accident. As Johns has stated, "I've always been attracted to poetry," and "I don't go very long without reading poetry."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's fascination with literature is less an avocation than an integral part of his own artistic production. Not only has he collaborated with writers in such pieces as <span style="font-style:italic;">Skin with O'Hara Poem</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Foirades / Fizzles</span> (produced jointly with Beckett), he has also responded to authors in a variety of creative ways in work entirely his own. In his published sketchbooks, for instance, he muses on statements by Baudelaire, Blake, and Flaubert while contemplating potential projects.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Johns's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Seasons</span> represent one such literary-visual crossover taken to completion. The idea for the series came to Johns when he was asked to contribute to a special volume of Wallace Stevens's poems.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> There are many other comparable examples throughout Johns's body of work. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ventriloquism</span> contains an obscured image of Melville's Moby Dick taken from an  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> engraving.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Screen Painting 3</span> incorporates the title page of Ted Berrigan's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sonnets</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Céline</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tennyson</span> announce themselves as homages in their very titles.</p>
<p>Given the extent of Johns's literacy and given his repeated explorations of literary material, one cannot simply assert a vague affinity between the artist and a poet. He considers the interface between writing and painting to be a worthy object of sustained inquiry. As he puts it, "I don't think we need to worry about forging links between painting and poetry … here we are, it's done!"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> To be true to Johns's art, critics must take account of his hybrid, self-aware, visual and textual aesthetic. Coming to grips with Crane series of 1962–63 requires knowledge of where and how it fits into the evolution of that aesthetic.</p>
<p>During the years immediately previous, 1955–61, Johns had concentrated on depicting (or incorporating into his paintings) familiar, man-made objects such as targets, flags, coat hangers, and light bulbs. He wants viewers to speculate about what uses these objects might serve in these strange new contexts. These displacements violate the autonomy prized by many mid-century art critics. A work such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag</span>, for example, insists upon being read as a political statement in addition to an aesthetic one (even if, as some have argued, that statement is the adoption of a studiously apolitical pose). The arch-modernist, Clement Greenberg, accused Johns of a category error, the introduction of "literary" qualities into painting, a purely optical art.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Hal Foster offers a more contemporary way of stating this same point: Johns's early work functions "textually." Instead of striving to create a striking image, he investigates how signs, symbols, and icons operate and circulate in society.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's inquiry into how isolated objects signify gradually led him to ponder higher orders of signification as well. In the same years that he was turning out famous pieces such as <span style="font-style:italic;">White Flag</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Green Target</span> , he also started to think about the complex semiotic problems posed by written language. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Tango</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span>  he began a lifelong habit of stenciling words onto canvases. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gray Alphabets</span>  he filled the surface of a painting with letters. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Alley Oop</span>  he collaged a comic strip onto cardboard. Perhaps emblematic of this early phase in Johns's career is <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> , an open hard back that has been attached, spine down, to a piece of wood. The exposed pages are coated by red encaustic. Through the wax one can make out lines of letters but few individual words. Central to this piece is the pun red / read. Can one "read" a painting? Or does one just observe its colors? What relation exists between an application of "red" paint and the "reading" that we impose on such a choice?</p>
<p>Crucially, it is the rhyme of read / red that links the artist's act of creation and a viewer's act of interpretation. Artist and audience are brought together by an artful use of language. As Johns says, "you can come to see something through language that you couldn't have come to see through looking."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Moreover, <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> explicitly targets speakers of English. In Russian, for instance, "red"—<span style="font-style:italic;">krasnoe</span>—and "read"—<span style="font-style:italic;">chital</span>—have nothing in common. <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> moves into the untranslatable realm of verse. It is easy to forget that Johns was just twenty-five years old when he painted his first <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag</span>. Afterwards, he progressed from relatively simple (for him!) symbolic games toward the convoluted linguistic play found in modern poetry. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In 1961, Jasper Johns painted his first work to engage a specific poem intertextually, <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings—Frank O'Hara</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Several excellent readings of this painting are available; in the present context, a few observations will suffice.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> is a two-panel work with two hinges in its center. Although invisible in reproduction, in person a viewer can make out the words "DEAD MAN." Heavily overpainted, they appear twice in the lower-right-hand corner, the second smaller occurrence superimposed over the first, as if the phrase were in motion toward or away. These words are puzzling. Why would Johns associate death with his friend O'Hara five years before he died in a freak accident?</p>
<p>As with <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span>, one must look "outside" the artwork for answers to the questions that it poses. Here, rather than rely on a simple pun suggested by his materials, Johns's title directs us to a much more complex, prior use of language, O'Hara's poem "In Memory of My Feelings." On one level, the phrase "DEAD MAN" is simply an indicator of the poem's contents. Just as Johns dutifully paints the canvas blue to reflect lines such as "I'm too blue" and "her eyes … blue like mine," so too he could find there a welter of references to mortality: "murder," "kill," "death," "died," and "dead." Twice O'Hara even speaks of himself as dead or dying.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The lyric, though, is intricate and long. Johns's decision to focus a viewer's attention on mortality stems from an intimate appreciation of both the poem and the poet. Enthusiastically at home in frenetic mid-century Manhattan, O'Hara felt an intense aversion to stasis. One stops changing, he believed, only when one stops breathing. "In Memory of My Feelings" is O'Hara's most extended meditation on this principle. A poet, he explains, faces the nearly impossible task of tracking the Heraclitean flux of a self in time. If he or she is to be true that the flux, no image, no phrase, no idea can reach full articulation. Each becomes "dead," so to speak, in the very instant of formulating it and hence must be discarded. The particular "self," too, to which it was to refer, has already ceased to exist. He concedes that there remains a living if indefinite "self" that continues to occupy the very instant of creation—a self that, serpent-like, sheds its former, "dead" selves, which, in their continuing deposition, testifies to the ongoing "aliveness" of its creator. It is impossible, alas, to capture or depict meaningfully this essential self in a completed poem. Once a poet finishes a lyric, it by necessity enshrines no more than a series of dead selves with no necessary connection to the moving, mercurial "I" that is the poet's essence.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's "DEAD MAN," then, suggests a perceptive reading of O'Hara's poetics. But—insofar as O'Hara is teaching a lesson about identity and creativity in general—perhaps one should read "DEAD MAN" as referring to Johns, too? That is, he could very well be borrowing O'Hara's reformulation of the lyric "I" to test one possible relation between himself and his art. By painting "DEAD MAN," then painting over it, painting it again, and then painting over it yet again, he dramatizes his own progressive cycles of "death" and "resurrection" in the act of creation. One "self" dies, to be replaced by another, only to die in turn. His art thus reflects his thoughts or attitudes at a particular moment, but with the passing of that moment, there is no meaningful way to recapture fully what those thoughts were. Those feelings, and that self, are now "dead," and therefore no longer part of "me." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>O'Hara's "I" seems to have offered Johns a conceptual alternative to the prevailing understanding of the relation between painter and painting circa 1961. He gained leverage against what he saw as Abstract Expressionism's belief in a link between a dynamic application of paint and authentic self-expression. In 1973 he stated,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Abstract Expressionism was so lively—personal identity and painting were more or less the same, and I tried to operate the same way. But I found I couldn't do anything that would be identical with my feelings. So I worked in such a way that I could say that it's not me.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">However "lively" the drama of self-exposure may be, "personal identity" cannot find its wholly legible cognate in a "painting."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> A stable, constant "personal identity" is a fiction stemming from a misunderstanding of temporality. Traces of many irretrievable "identities" (and "feelings") accrue on a canvas while "painting" it. In his poem, O'Hara speaks of the "scene of my selves."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> For Johns, the painting itself is that scene—with the caveat that the selves it records are "dead." He can, therefore, say regarding his work that "it's not [the present-tense] me" without denying his role in making the painting ("it's not me" does not contradict the fact that "it was me," or, more precisely, "many of me"). He remains an active agent without declaring himself a Jackson Pollock-like action painter.</p>
<p>One must not confuse his desire to be able to say that a work "is not me" with a desire to exclude emotional content. Johns has always been willing to attribute affective  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> force to individual artworks, whether a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci or a ballet by 27 Merce Cunningham.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> is a patently melancholy work. The predominant colors—blue and gray—convey sadness, and the mostly-bare patch in the upper-left hand corner suggests incompletion, or loss. He does not exclude feelings <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span> from the province of art; he asserts that the affect conveyed by a given work might or might not bear a relation to emotions that he himself is experiencing at the present moment or that he felt at a time in the past. In short, he holds that no artwork allows us transparent access to its creator's inner life. Such a tenet, though, does not preclude the existence of an inner life. Drawing on O'Hara, Johns could grant "my feelings" a place in his art without subscribing to naïve ideas about self-expression.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rite of Passage</h1>
<p>In 1962, the year after <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>, Johns painted his first Crane work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>. The similarities between the two paintings are striking. <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, like the 1961 piece, takes a single poem, Crane's "Passage," as its intertext. Again like its precursor, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> applies techniques and references found in its intertext after translating them into visual equivalents. It, too, probes the relation of creator, thing created, and "the scene of my selves." Johns, in fact, explicitly cues a viewer to think of the two canvases as related. One of the most prominent elements in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> has been borrowed from the O'Hara homage. In the latter painting, a fork and a spoon dangle from a wire in the left-hand panel. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, about a third of the way from the top, Johns suspends a fork horizontally. Below it he has painted a <span style="font-style:italic;">trompe l'oeil</span> shadow of the fork as well as of the chain and the wire that hold it in place.</p>
<p>The remainder of the painting revisits other motifs used in previous works. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">Out the Window</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Sea</span> , it consists of three horizontal regions, labeled, from top to bottom, "RED," "YELLOW," and "BLUE." As Johns's earlier titles indicate, he associates this format with landscape painting. Specifically, he seems to have in mind Mark Rothko's famous 1950s three-rectangle compositions, so evocative of dreamscapes or psychological interiors. He indicates depth, however, not through Rothko-like coloration—he has spread encaustic over the canvas without matching pigments to the stenciled color words—but through another device, one familiar from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. A second, smaller word "BLUE" has been stenciled over the first, suggesting motion into or out of an illusionistic distance. The top panel in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> recycles another Johns favorite of the early 1960s: a ruler, pinned to the canvas's left side, which appears to have been used to smear the paint beneath it in an arc. On the smear he has written the word "SCRAPE," and, nearby, a curved directional arrow points toward the ruler's current position. The ruler seems to have been interrupted in its course by another object, the horizontally-suspended fork. Consequently, this ruler, labeled "RULER," completes only a quarter-circle. Just outside this partial circle one can observe the imprint of an iron in the wax, over the top of which Johns has written "IRON." A second partial circle, identical in shape to the first, appears in ghostly outline in the bottom left-hand corner. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As should be evident, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> is a much more heterogeneous painting than <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. Johns assembles a number of elements that bear the connotative burden of their earlier uses in his <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>. For instance, "Passage" opens at a seashore: "Where the cedar leaf divides the sky / I heard the sea."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Accordingly, Johns draws on <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Sea</span> to provide his own "seaside" motif, the bands labeled red, yellow, and blue. This principle of metonymic substitution extends to technique as well as imagery. For example, "Passage" mentions an iron – "Why are you back here, smiling an iron coffin?"<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup>—so Johns, already having tried leaving impressions in wax in such 1961 works as <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting Bitten by a Man, No</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Liar</span>, melts an iron's shape onto his canvas.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, however, does not aim to illustrate "Passage" through a rigorous, one-to-one correspondence between its elements and the events and things that Crane describes. Rather, "Passage" becomes an occasion for Johns to try out his nascent visual "vocabulary" within a "plot" only loosely suggested by the poem's contents. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and "Passage" alike, the governing narrative convention is the quest romance. Crane's "Passage" portrays a speaker moving phantasmagorically through a shifting landscape (hills, a ravine, alleys, perhaps an orchard or field) buffeted by the forces of nature (a burning sun, rain, wind, the "spear" of an evening). The speaker confronts his opposite and antagonist, a "thief," and they engage in a ritualized exchange of words. The thief closes a book stolen from the speaker, and the sands of Egypt "trough" them.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> One is left uncertain whether they have been magically transported, suddenly slain, or metaphorically submerged in the sands of time.</p>
<p>In short, the journey in "Passage" is an arcane, archetypal one upon which a critic can build any number of equally valid interpretations.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Crane revisits the allegorical romance form of Edmund Spenser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Faërie Queene</span> but denies a reader the certitude of a stable allegorical frame. He undoubtedly learned this disorienting strategy from one of his favorite poets, Arthur Rimbaud, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Illuminations</span> stand behind not only "Passage" but also "Repose of Rivers," "Possessions," and "Voyages." These lyrics describe vivid elusive landscapes that recall those anatomized by Marjorie Perloff in her work on the French symbolist:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Rimbaud's cityscape is … a phantasmagoria. Like a stage-set, it makes use of stylized backdrops: now a scene of craters and copper palm trees, now platforms in the midst of whirlpools, now a Baghdad boulevard. It is the landscape of fairytale, of calculated artifice.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Crane, like Rimbaud, recounts journeys that ought to carry deep meaning but refuse to do so straightforwardly. They ensure that the poet-visionary, as a latter-day questerknight, shares marvels too lofty, strange, and evanescent to yield up their significance to mundane logic.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, Johns labors to create a similarly charged, evasive narrative. He creates a "passage" of energies that takes place in a downward motion across the field of his painting. The sharp nose of the iron nudges the ruler's quarter circle; the ruler collides with the fork; the fork casts a shadow; and a second "shadow," of the quarter circle,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> appears at the canvas's bottom edge. The written words "SCRAPE," "RULER" and "IRON" hint at players and motivations that may lie behind this domino-like vector of force. One with "iron" will, or a master of "irony," puts the "ruler" of the land into a "scrape," thereby toppling him. The ruler's fall casts long "shadows" into the surrounding territory or down the years.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> Johns tests new artistic territory, the placing of multiple, indeterminate, but already familiar signs in a pattern suggestive of an occulted storyline. Moreover, he uses a poem as model for how one might assemble such an artwork. He relies upon the symbolist inflection of the venerable romance quest to solve a particular artistic problem identified by conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth: how to arrive at "language forms" in which to organize one's "'private' codes" given modern art's "freedom from morphological constrictions."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Crane's revision of the romance narrative provides Johns a "morphology" for his painting, that is, rules for how to combine the elements in his growing artistic "vocabulary" in order to convey the desired effect.</p>
<p>Understood in this way, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> is not simply a "complexly displaced homosexual autobiography."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> A biographical reading of the painting arrives at one possible storyline generated by an allegorical framework that could just as readily generate two, three, or a hundred others.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> Johns even anticipates that his audience might assume that his work's inspiration is biographical, and he indicates that such a premise places undue weight on an artwork's antecedent conditions. One of the "passages" at issue in the painting is between artist, artwork, and viewer. In clarifying this relationship, Johns builds on the idea of the "death of the artist" already advanced in <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. The impression of an iron is serves to comment both on his source text and on his self-conception as an artist. Crane writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Touching an opening laurel, I found<br>A thief beneath, my stolen book in hand.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>"Why are you back here—smiling an iron coffin?"<br>"To argue with the laurel," I replied:<br>"Am justified in transience, fleeing<br>Under the constant wonder of your eyes—."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">A "laurel," a symbol of public acclaim for a writer, attracts the speaker's notice after the first phase of his archetypal journey. This "opening laurel" does not portend a triumph, however. The speaker discovers a "thief" has "stolen" his "book." This confrontation could be an allegory for the experience of publication. Once in the public sphere, once in competition for the "laurel" of success, a poet's work passes beyond his control. It enters the grasp ("in hand") of his readers, who have usurped his place (perhaps suggesting the fall of the "RULER" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>). Crane offers one means of redressing this imbalance. The poet can attempt "argue with the laurel," or make known his own interpretation of his art and vocation. Crane's speaker, like O'Hara, insists that he is "justified in transience." In other words, he has the right to evade his readers' demands, to flee before their eyes and become someone new, write something  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> new—thereby achieving the freedom of the "improved infancy" that the poem's opening lines promise.</p>
<p>In this context, the "iron coffin" that the speaker smiles seems intended as a threat. He has caught the reader / thief in the act of stealing his words, and he now will forcibly put things right. After <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>, however, Johns would have been predisposed to read more into the thief's line about the iron coffin. It becomes an effective bit of dramatic iron-y, so to speak. The speaker, as an alter ego of the poet, smiles an "iron coffin," because he is, after a fashion, dead. He is one of O'Hara's "ruses," a husk of what Crane once was for a brief time, Crane-the-Prophet-Poet as incarnated during the writing of "Passage."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> From this point of view, being "justified in transience" is not to achieve an "improved infancy." Or, rather, it might mean that for the artist, as he or she moves on from work to work. Any completed work, however, and therefore any authorial alter ego therein, is a "dead," sloughed off shell. In effect, the poem is a "coffin" that entombs a possible, momentary, or partial poetic "self."</p>
<p>Johns's decision to sear the encaustic of his canvas with an iron provides a macabre variant on an Abstract Expressionist technique commonly used to assert the living presence, not the "death," of the artist. The indexical traces of an artist's hand—brushstrokes, skin imprints, spills—in paintings such as Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Autumn Rhythm</span> and de Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> imply a harmonious unity between creator and thing created. A hot iron, however, is something that children from day one are told not to touch. The impression of an iron expresses Johns's violent repudiation of his artwork, which in turn becomes an "iron coffin" that "seals" away what is no longer alive to the artist and what is no longer wanted. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> the iron's imprint fittingly stands at the beginning of the chain reaction that leads down the canvas. An initial gesture of disavowal, or repression, takes place prior to, and in essence licenses, the narrative that follows. The "death" of the artist is thus a prerequisite for the creation of the kind of "language forms" that Johns's canvases propose. Biography might give one access to the prior circumstances that give rise to a particular artwork, but it also remains external to the resulting sign system.</p>
<p>By the time that he completed his first Crane painting, Johns had arrived at a sophisticated understanding of lyric poetry and its possible uses as an analog for a visual artwork. He came to treat a poem as an ordered set of signs on which one can draw in solving semiotic problems in other media. Moreover, he develops a thesis about the "death of the artist" that preres the death of the author <span style="font-style:italic;">topos</span> common in later French poststructuralist theory. After <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, he would long continue mining the theme of <span style="font-style:italic;">memento mori</span> in relation to the artistic process, all the way from the skull impression in <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrive / Depart</span> (1963–64) to the skulls and spinal cords of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tantric Detail</span> series (1980–81).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Dive In</h1>
<p>Johns's second Crane painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> , measures seven and a half by fourteen feet two inches [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Its mural-like size, unrivaled in Johns's previous work,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seems calculated to call to mind such powerful 1950s works as de Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Excavation</span>, Kline's <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting Number Two</span>, and Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lucifer</span>. Moreover, in contrast to the predominantly gray or dark blue paintings of 1961–62, <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> is a showcase for color: reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, and purples, in addition to whites, grays, and blacks. The oil paint has been applied in the manner almost invariably described as "de Kooningesque" by Johns's critics. That is, the large, irregular patches of color feature broad slashing brushstrokes, overpainting, drips, and variations in hue and thickness—traits stereotypically identified with the New York School of the 1940s and 50s. Significantly, in contrast to earlier paintings such as <span style="font-style:italic;">False Start</span> , these echoes of his predecessors are not satirical. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s scale does not come across as a mocking comment on his forbears, nor do the "de Kooningesque" portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> read as through-and-through inauthentic. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s relatively sympathetic treatment of this legacy deserves attention. In <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> Johns turned to a poet for leverage against Abstract Expressionism's doctrine of self-exposure. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> he learns from Crane to reject a straightforward, indexical link between his painting's surface and his own hand. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> seems to ask whether Crane and the Abstract Expressionist legacy might have more in common than Johns had first supposed.</p>

<p>To unpack what this affiliation might imply, one must first look carefully at the painting itself. The scale of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> is only one aspect of a very unusual work. Its five-panel, serial form, with wide variations in style from part to part, has no obvious precedent in Johns's pre-1962 <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, nor in U.S. art more generally. The proximate source for <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s formal strategy seems to be the poetry of Crane, whom Johns has repeatedly cited as the painting's inspiration.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s use of sequential panels suggestively recalls Crane's attempt in his volume <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>  to move beyond the composition of compartmentalized lyrics (such as "Passage") toward an "epic" mode based on the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tradition of the poem cycle. In a letter to his patron Otto Kahn, Crane describes <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> in terms that Johns would have appreciated:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[E]ach section of the entire poem has represented its own unique problem of form, not alone in relation to the materials embodied within its separate confines, but also in relation to the other parts, <span style="font-style:italic;">in series</span>, of the major design of the entire poem. Each is a separate canvas, as it were, yet none yields its entire significance when seen apart from the others.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Separate yet conjoined canvases; a conjunctive disjunction; a form allowing for maximal attention to each portion of a larger work as it is made, without denying the significance of the eventual aggregate. One could argue that Johns, having mastered the art of creating discrete, self-sufficient works—such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag, Target with Four Faces</span>, and, more recently, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>—discovered in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> a model of how to combine a talent for small-scale creations with the production of grander, "epic" art. Insofar as Abstract Expressionist canvases such as Newman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cathedra</span> and Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mural</span> had set the contemporary standard for "epic" achievement in the visual arts, Crane's plan might have seemed an ideal means for Johns to match the ambition of his predecessors without producing an overly derivative work.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> Johns accordingly rejects Pollock's alloverness and the "large shapes" of Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman as means to achieving a lofty style.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> He does not wish to inflate so much as to accumulate. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, relies on accretion and juxtaposition as its principles of construction. The first panel features a semi-circle of bright colors that have been smeared onto the canvas by a paint stick pinned to its edge. The second panel consists of a vertical tonal scale that ranges from black through violet gray to white and back into gray. The third and fourth present four handprints and two footprints symmetrically arrayed above a tape measure. The fifth panel displays several stenciled words—RED, BLUE, YELL[OW]—as well as a fork, knife, and spoon suspended in vertical position by a taut, horizontal wire. Here Johns brings together assemblage, expressionist brushstrokes, and geometric abstraction. He recycles old motifs such as color names, measuring instruments, skin impressions, and the cutlery from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> in a jumble that, like the miscellany of objects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, seems as enigmatic as revelatory. Yet one cannot even say that the painting is consistent in its principle of discontinuity. The final three panels are covered by a single field of colors that vary from red to blue to yellow as one moves diagonally from the lower left to the upper right. Just as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> pieces together lyrics of varying degrees of interrelation more through a mixture of fiat and recurrent motifs than internal necessity, so too Johns asserts cohesion through an uneasy blend of brute seriality and a selective blurring of boundaries.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>The connection between <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> goes well beyond such structural homologies, however. Key to their dialogue is the eponymous re of the Diver. In the painting's third and fourth panels, two footprints appear at the top of the work. Below them, two sets of handprints are linked vertically by strips of scraped paper. Barely visible beneath layers of brightly colored paint are graphite directional markers that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indicate, first, that the upper set of hands should be imagined as moving downwards and, second, that the lower hands move apart, outwards, and upwards, tracing mirror-image arcs. If one envisions these movements sequentially, they suggest someone taking a swan dive. Falling head-first, a diver stretches out his arms to meet the water, and, having broken the surface, he pulls his arms out and back up so as to plunge as deeply as possible. A viewer who knows that <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> belongs to the 1962–63 Crane series would correctly associate the painting's central re with the poet himself, who did, after all, die after leaping off a cruise ship into the Caribbean. But anyone who also knows <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> well would quickly appreciate that there is more to the story. In "To Brooklyn Bridge," on the very first page of Crane's book, the action is interrupted by a sudden suicidal gesture: "A bedlamite speeds to [the bridge's] parapets, / Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning" in full view of "the speechless caravan" below. Strangely, Crane does not tell what happens next. He writes instead that a "jest falls" from the crowd, that is, someone tells a joke, and, immediately afterwards, "Down Wall, from girder into street, leaks noon."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> These repeated, metaphoric movements downwards tease a reader with a desire to know whether the bedlamite himself has likewise traveled in that direction. Only at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, after many pages' suspense, after covering thousands of miles and hundreds of years of U.S. history and at last returning to Brooklyn Bridge, does someone at last hit the water. This time it is the poem's speaker who is immersed and, fearing drowning, prays to God, "O Thou whose radiance doth inherit me," to "hold thy floating singer late!"<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In between leap and splash the effect is rather like watching Bill Viola's video piece <span style="font-style:italic;">The Reflecting Pool</span> (1977–79), in which a man is caught mid-cannonball and left hanging above a body of water that continues roiling and reflecting the changing seasons. One could say that Crane's poem cycle as a whole occurs in the marvelously prolonged instant between beginning and completing an ecstatic leap.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in early Rimbaud-inspired lyrics such as "Passage," Crane constructs "fairytale" landscapes of pure artifice. Later, however, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, he begins to think about how such gloriously escapist episodes relate to the rest of everyday life. People, after all, do not imaginatively inhabit poetic landscapes in perpetuity. They enter and leave them <span style="font-style:italic;">ad libitum</span>. Or, to use the terms suggested by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, they leap—and then experience giddy motion until they land. As a metaphor for readers' interactions with a text, this is, it must be admitted, a peculiar one. By deliberating prolonging a fall for hundreds of pages, is Crane foolishly delaying the inevitable? Is he being heroic? By calling the jumper a "bedlamite," is he making a value judgment about the irrationality of a reader's willingness to "dive" into a book-length poem? Is he commenting on the insanity of his own project, his attempt to dilate a momentary joy (wheee!) until it attains epic sublimity? Regardless, by framing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> with a life-imperiling leap, Crane creates a parentheses that calls attention to a distinction between time "before" the text, time's passage "inside" the text, and the "after" external to it. Does the jump into a poem give a reader access to a different, special temporality—the order of eternity, in which Atlantis never sinks and floating singers never drown—or does a poem's contents unfold within the order of human causality, in which bedlamites have past histories and swimmers in the open sea can sink for well and good? <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In other words, Crane's increasing awareness of art's temporality leads him to call into question the division between the spaces of art and life. Intentionally or not, he also thereby provokes his readers to wonder about the interpenetration of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> and his own biography. The romantic myth of the poet who dies young was literalized in his case, but his poetry, in its attempts to grapple with the boundaries between the literary and extra-literary, lends the time and manner of his demise a thematic importance unequaled in other similar cases. The tragic early deaths of, say, Pushkin and Marlowe do not dominate discussions of their individual works to the same degree as Crane's supposed death wish governs debate of his. Mortality, and the poet's own death, become inescapably central to Crane's mature revision of romantic poetics. He "does not so much distinguish as superimpose the positions of the visionary and the suicide—as if these two positions, for all appearances, were simply identical."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns elucidates how the Diver, caught in his descent, becomes the precondition of Crane's epic. He perceives that this one image, present on the periphery of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>—in its proem and in its conclusion, as well as in the life of its author—is, in fact, its keystone. In turn, by making the Diver spatially and conceptually central to his painting, Johns asks that his viewers read his painting over and against his modernist precursor's masterpiece. Like Crane, he suspends us between the factual reach of artists and an eternal Eden that exceeds their grasp. The intimations of transcendence present in the rainbow-like arc or the ladder-like tone scale provide a spiritual or psychological "depth" to <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> that exist in tension with reminders of the canvas's flatness (the handprints) and obdurate materiality (the measuring tape). Perhaps tension is the wrong word. The coexistence of contraries does not produce conflict or a dialectic. The strange "superimpositions" and suspensions in Crane's verse prere Johns's ability to permit a wide assortment of tendencies, techniques, and ideas to find place within an artwork.</p>
<p>In the end, one can say that Johns shares Crane's romantic faith in the role of art to a surprising degree. They agree that the artist's quest for the ineffable may be quixotic or suicidal but it still yields value, in the concrete artifact if nothing else: arcs, bridges, and circles inscribed and defended as form wrested from chaos. But such forms are not prized in their purity. Just as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>—digressive, uneven, episodic—fails to achieve the kind of perfect spherical form prized by modernists such as W.B. Yeats, so too <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and its antecedents such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Device Circle</span> pointedly reject the abstract, geometric self-sufficiency of Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich. The art of Crane and Johns remains open to, and reproduces structurally, entropy, confusion, dispersion and all the forces that render utopian the dream of perfect order in the here and now.</p>
<p>By exposing his artwork to the external world—to randomness, to written texts, to a writer's life—Johns militates against the pure autonomy of art that the high modernists esteemed so highly. Painters such as Pollock, de Kooning, and Rothko may have believed in spontaneity and the utility of accident, but, as Alwynne Mackie's <span style="font-style:italic;">Art / Talk</span> makes clear, such moments were subordinated to the aim of creating an artwork that functions as a single unit, that is, a unique, holistic symbol that produces meaning independent of any extrinsic agent, sign-system, or body of knowledge.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> does not rest content with this decontextualized symbolism. Symbols it has in abundance—the Diver, the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ladder, the rainbow—but they are subordinated to a larger, curiously linguistic frame. The painting's five panels, advancing left to right, resemble the placement of words on a page. Johns also indicates that ending on a fifth panel is arbitrary. The edge of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> lops off the last two letters of what one assumes should be the word "YELLOW," given the nearby "BLUE" and "RED." All that is left is "YELL"—the word protests its own truncation! A viewer imagines an absent, sixth panel, which would complete the word, and if there could be a sixth, why not a seventh … <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> trails off like a sentence ending in ellipses.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s serial, paratactic form recalls Theodor Adorno's discussion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> about visual art that approaches the condition of "language":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Works of art approximate a language of things by virtue of the inner organization of their disparate moments, i.e. through their own language <span style="font-style:italic;">qua</span> art works. The more they undergo syntactical articulation, the more language-like they do become … Traditional aesthetics completely ignores this, prejudging the relation of whole and parts in favour of the whole.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">By adopting the additive principle that he discovers in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, Johns defies "traditional aesthetics" and the fuzzy organic symbolism to which it often gave rise in 1940s and 50s New York. He arrives at what Adorno calls "wordless syntax," a means of expressing "linguisticality" within the visual arts.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Symbols and icons become only a subset of many devices available for a painter to combine within the "language" that governs the "syntactical articulation" of an artwork. Hence <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s seeming unconcern about mixing heady symbolism with reminders of the canvas's materiality: the disparate elements can follow one another like words in a sentence. Johns creates a monumental painting whose themes include transcendental longing, fear of death, and joy in the act of creation—New York School favorites all—without having to perpetuate Abstract Expressionist dictates about how such subject matter should be rendered in paint. Crane teaches Johns how to take up where his predecessors left off.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Land Ho</h1>
<p>Johns appears to have been satisfied with the serial form of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. He would use it frequently in coming years in such landmark works as <span style="font-style:italic;">Harlem Light, Wall Piece</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled</span> . He does not appear to have been as content with the questions about transcendence that <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> raises. He seems to have been unsure whether it was an adequate response to Abstract Expressionist mystic symbolism to demote it to the status of one painterly device among many. Does such a strategy unpack or only suppress art's traditional role of constructing symbols referring to gods, ghosts, the unconscious, and a host of other intangibles?</p>
<p>As if to play fair, in 1963 Johns produced two further works inspired by Crane, the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>, which set aside <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s sentence-like form in favor of a more conventional, one-panel design. In these canvases, Johns grapples with art's transcendental capacities by reviving an issue that Clement Greenberg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had tried to relegate to the dustbin of history: the use of illusionistic devices intended to deceive the eye. Johns wonders whether such devices permit a viewer to pass "through" the flat surface of the picture plane and enter into an immaterial space, possibly language, the past, or another world. As he comments in his notebooks, "What seems literal can twist or be twisted into something else—as rigidly literal works tend to become transcendental."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>, the first-executed of the 1963 works, announces Johns's desire to restate <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s concerns within the compositional field of his earlier Crane-inspired work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. On one hand, <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> resembles an abridged, night-time version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. The paint stick attached to the upper right edge of the canvas has, like its counterpart in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, smeared a rainbow-spectrum—although black paint overlays and darkens it. One of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s directional arrows also remains, pointing downwards on top of an applied piece of paper. A handprint, like that of the Diver, stretches upward at the end of another strip of paper. Johns has used red, yellow, blue, orange, green, and white oil paint in various places in the background, but the predominant colors are gray and black, more closely echoing the first panel of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> in coloration and brushwork than that earlier painting's vivid hues in the third through fifth panels. These citations from <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> are placed against a backdrop borrowed from <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>. The RED / YELLOW / BLUE horizontal bands recur, as do small details, such as the twofold appearance of the word "BLUE," the second instance occurring smaller and directly on top of the first.</p>
<p>Appropriately, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> combines the elegiac impulses of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> with <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>'s intimations of action in a landscape. The 1963 painting depicts a scene that bears a strong resemblance to Crane's suicide, as described in Philip Horton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hart Crane: The Life of an American Poet</span> , a book that Johns is known to have owned:<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Crane walked quickly to the stern of the ship, and … [he] vaulted over the rail into the boiling wake. The alarm was general and immediate. There was a clangor of bells as the ship's engines ground into reverse; life preservers were thrown overboard; a lifeboat was lowered. Some claim they saw an arm raised from above the water.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The implied allegorical narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, which remains resolutely ambiguous, here gives way to a very traditional subject matter, an elegy for a drowning man. Crane waves to his would-be rescuers, or strains toward the setting sun, even as he sinks below the waves.</p>
<p>Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage, Land's End</span> does not refer by name to a specific poem or line in Crane's <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, but Johns could have chosen few titles more redolent of Crane's sensibility. The seashore is one of Crane's <span style="font-style:italic;">idées fixes</span>, showing up in such diverse lyrics as "O Carib Isle!," "Voyages" I, "Repose of Rivers," "The Air Plant," and "The Bathers." The seashore is a profoundly important liminal space for Crane. To one side stands the mundane world of agriculture, office work, and domestic life. On the other side looms the ocean, Crane's symbol for the sublime, infinite flux of the inhuman. Like a bedlamite hanging from a bridge, a man on a beach occupies a dangerous in-between position but attains proximity to the eternal. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>The beach is also the place where the living can encounter the no longer living, those who have lapsed back into chaos. "Cape Hatteras" and "At Melville's Tomb," both taking place on the seashore, are Crane's greatest elegies. To justify this choice of location in "At Melville's Tomb," Crane goes so far as to imply that Melville drowned at sea—something patently false, since Melville is buried next to his wife Elizabeth Shaw in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. One could, therefore, argue that, in sympathy with Crane's worldview, Johns positions his viewers at "land's end" so that we, too, may occupy Crane's threshold space and, presumably, so that we may enter into what "Cape Hatteras" calls a "junction elegiac."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>, another elegy, soon after <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> is identical in size to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and similar in composition. It, too, uses the tripartite canvas division of <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, although Johns restricts his pallet almost exclusively  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to grays, blue grays, and black. The rainbow-like "device circle" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> is, therefore, replaced by a fan-shaped gray scale, with its outer edge white and inner core black.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> The second crucial distinction between the paintings involves the placement of the ghostly arm. Instead of having it thrust upward in the center of the canvas, Johns has superimposed it over the device-circle's paint stick. Perhaps a viewer is to picture a swimmer's arm captured mid-stroke. Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>, where the absence of a body makes illusionistic sense—it would naturally be below the sea's surface—here a body's absence seems slightly disorienting, as if Johns has taken to an extreme the kind of cropping to which Degas subjects his ballet dancers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> takes its title from an early portion of Crane's poem "Cape Hatteras." Crane begins the poem by situating the Cape within immensities of geologic time and interplanetary space. He then begins to consider humanity's ability to perceive such sublimity:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>[T]ime clears<br>Our lenses, lifts a focus, resurrects<br>A periscope to glimpse what joys or pain<br>Our eyes can share or answer—then deflects<br>Us, shunting to a labyrinth submersed<br>Where each sees only his dim past reversed …</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>But that star-glistered salver of infinity,<br>The circle, blind crucible of endless space,<br>Is sluiced by motion,—subjugated never.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Crane contrasts the intermittence of revelation and the constancy of "infinity." The first part of the passage is a witty play on 1 Corinthians 13:12, "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face." Crane imagines the "dark glass" of perception in the fallen world (the "labyrinth submersed") as a "lens" receiving an occasional polish and the proper setting for us to "glimpse" celestial truth before again sinking back into the murk. Caught in this cycle, humanity can only parody the "endless," perfect circular movement of the heavens. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> reproduces, after a fashion, what "Cape Hatteras" describes.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In an ocean-like setting, a hand is poised midway between travel up or down. The scraped semi-circle indicates that it has tracked the entire course before, perhaps many times.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> retreat from the elusive allegorical mode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and the paratactic seriality of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. Their formal novelty lies elsewhere, in their complex handling of pictorial space. <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> contains several indications of downward movement, such as the directional arrow and the stenciling of several letters ("Y," "E," "W," and "U") in inverted or tilted fashion as "echoes" below their "original" position. These are counterbalanced by the upward-thrusting arm and hand. In addition, the word "RED" has a mirror-image to its right, suggesting oblique motion. In contrast to these vectors of force in the painting, which remain on the surface, "BLUE" and "RED" have second, smaller color words superimposed atop them, suggesting either recession or procession. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> displays a similarly busy surface. The letters "B,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "L," "U," and "E" are jumbled in heap below and to the left of "BLUE." A "Y" and "E" 39 appear oblique left of "YELLOW." "R," "E," and "D" have each been reflected across a vertical or horizontal axis and then strung along a diagonal toward the upper-right of "RED." <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, then, emphasizes centrifugal motion (left, down, upwards) and rotation in a third dimension. In both these paintings, Johns opposes active motion within the picture plane to a forward-and-back movement through it.</p>
<p>In "Jasper Johns" , Rosalind Krauss criticizes <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> in terms also applicable to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, she observes, offers a "mock-vista" that "wrenches open the painting to deep views into traditional pictorial space" instead of exhibiting a modernist "control of the surface."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> She worries that Johns, by violating Greenbergian principles, has relinquished his leading role in the avant-garde. She singles out his use of handprints for particular criticism because they produce an "illusionistic, spatial reading":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>By playing on the built-in ambiguity of the hand outline which can be read either as seen from the inside or the outside, the print image works here as though it emanated from a misty, luminous space inside the canvas, calling to mind the vague, but decidedly spatial quality of an x-ray photograph of a limb.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The two readings of the "hand outline" that Krauss presents—first, the artist's hand remains "outside" the canvas and, second, the hand should be seen as "emanating" from its "inside"—are not mutually exclusive. As we know, the raised hand in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> stands for Crane's. We are to imagine him reaching up out of the ocean in the moments before he sinks. But, as the record of a paint-coated hand pressed to the canvas, the hand also indexically stands for Johns's own. The one handprint thus ambivalently signifies two hands. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, one would presume, operates similarly. The hand on the end of the paint stick is, in some sense, both Crane's and Johns's, its identity depending on what kind of sign, icon, or index one chooses to read inscribed there. Or, just possibly, one is to imagine two hands approaching the surface of each canvas from different directions and, perhaps, touching. The seam between two sign-systems could become a point of contact. Johns's picture plane would then take on the role of Crane's beach as the boundary marker between living and dead, the present and the past.</p>
<p>To justify this claim will require some backtracking. Hands happen to have been one of Crane's favorite images, ring prominently in more than twenty five of his poems. In lyrics such as "Episode of Hands," "Bridge of Estador," "Voyages," and "Harbor Dawn," hands are intensely eroticized. Examples include the famous line "Permit me voyage, love, into your hands" as well as the more frankly sexual "your hands within my hands are deeds; / my tongue upon your throat—singing."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> For Crane, hands are also signs of agency. Frequently, they become a metonymy for a writer: for Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Erasmus.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> They are also a sign of natural or divine potency. Crane refers to the "hands" of the sea, the frost, the years, and autumn.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> And he refers to God in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> as "Hand of Fire."<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> Finally, hands link living and dead. In "My Grandmother's Love Letters," Crane, playing Orpheus, aspires "to lead my grandmother by the hand / Through much of what she would not understand" back to the living world.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The greatest "hand moment" in his verse occurs at the end of "Cape Hatteras," the poem which furnishes the titles for <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> and the lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>. Crane portrays himself going off hand in hand with Walt Whitman. In this one image, Crane attempts to combine the erotic, writerly, and supernatural connotations present in his other hand-references:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Afoot again, and onward without halt, —<br>Not soon, nor suddenly,—no, never to let go<br>    My hand<br>     in yours,<br>        Walt Whitman —<br>          so —<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The dead and the living poets come together in equality and amity. "Cape Hatteras," which dwells throughout on the horrors committed in the U.S. Civil War and in World War I, finds some compensation for these tragedies in this blissful act of communion. Not all the departed are gone forever, Crane teaches. The poetic imagination can resurrect the dead, after a fashion. The "Easters of speeding light" which "Cape Hatteras" foretells are made possible through rative language.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Like Crane in "Cape Hatteras," Johns in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> grants his dead hero an imaginary hand so that, through the medium of art, they can make contact. Unlike Crane, however, Johns cannot present this congress as joyous. He recognizes that Crane fudges an important distinction in "Cape Hatteras"—between the speaker and the author. Perhaps an alter ego of Crane can attain communion with Whitman, but Crane himself can only do so at a remove, through a misleading identification with this "dead," fictive projection of himself. <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> highlights this unbridgeable gap between actual and virtual artists. As <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> shows, Johns thinks of the artwork as a coffin containing a dead self or selves. While the end of "Cape Hatteras" might depict poetry as a refuge from "time's realm," Johns cannot imagine himself gaining access to such a space while still "alive." In <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> the two hands, the artist's and the poet's, can come together only via a parodic re-enactment of the close of "Cape Hatteras." The painting undertakes a three-fold elegy: for Crane, for a communion that can never be, and for a self that, entombed, might experience what the living artist cannot.</p>
<p>The pessimism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> might have motivated Johns to paint <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> almost immediately afterwards. The few differences between the canvases seem intended as correctives to the conclusions reached in the first one. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, the hand is not captured in the <span style="font-style:italic;">ave atque vale</span> pose of one drowning. The emphasis is no longer on stasis—the achieved artwork and its entombment of an impossible moment. Instead, the hand is portrayed as moving, seeking, and, in the process, creating an arc. As with <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, Johns and Crane alike consider that in itself an achievement, a means of holding the bounds against chaos. Moreover, if one imagines both Crane's and Johns's hands present simultaneously, they are likely to be pictured as moving in tandem. No longer two suicides, they are two artists engaged in coordinated action in their respective media. This innovation has the force of a conceptual breakthrough. The process of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> creating a work of art does not depend on identification between virtual or past artists and one living in the present tense. The "living" Johns does not need privileged access to the interior lives of those "former" artists. He can always learn from what "dead" selves accomplished, even if he can no longer be them, and he can learn from other dead artists, even if he cannot attain the ecstasy of union with them. These assorted incarnations of the artist can be conceived of as participating in a common mission unbounded by temporal or subjective limitations.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> seems a remarkably optimistic follow-up to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. The burden shifts from the "iron"-clad suppression of self that <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> suggests toward a less identity-obsessed formulation of an artist's relation to an artwork. If <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> concludes that the transcendence that art offers is real but sadly inaccessible, <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> shifts the inquiry back to process, namely, how to make a painting that points beyond the picture plane to indicate absent people, things, or concepts. Hands take center stage as signs of agency and shared effort. The 1963 lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>, a follow-up to <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, dramatizes this new attitude. It inflates <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>'s "device circle" until it fills half the work. A handprint appears squarely in the middle.</p>
<p>After <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>, the 1962–63 Crane series came to an end. His next major work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrive / Depart</span> (1963–64), was deliberately transitional. A handprint in the upper-right corner and a skull impression in the lower-right recall the Crane series. But it also contains elements, such as brightly colored, Hans Hofmann-like rectangles, that point toward a new phase in his career, toward such 1964 pieces as <span style="font-style:italic;">Watchman</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">According to What</span>. Johns seems to have found the answers that he was looking for during his most sustained foray into lyric poetry.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">All That Glitters</h1>
<p>In the fall of 1962, three of New York's most innovative artists, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol chose to redefine artistic agency in reaction to what they perceived as Abstract Expressionist excess. One path—that of Rauschenberg and Warhol—has dominated the way critics have written about the era. Johns's path represents a second option, one whose full importance has yet to be recognized. As Kirk Varnedoe writes, "histories of postwar American art" typically "freeze Johns's flame" around 1960, consigning him to "a lustrous but straitjacketed historical role as progenitor and man of transition for all that followed—the fuse-lighter of a different future." By omitting Johns's further development as an artist, "potted histories of postwar art" have falsely tidied up their narratives, making it seem as if there were only one possible direction in which the art world could evolve.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>After 1962 Rauschenberg and Warhol espouse an antihumanist position that has retrospectively come to be identified with Pop and other 1960s avant-garde movements. They deemphasized the shaping hand of the artist and instead draw attention to the self as a weak ego, inevitably shaped by social, economic, and other forces. The disturbing omnipresence of media images in U.S. life became their chief subject matter, not the imagination's autonomy. They lost interest in media that leave unpredictable,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indexical traces of the body of the person making an artwork. Silk screen was an ideal "hands-off" medium conveying impersonality and routinization. Working chiefly with mechanically-reproduced photographs, Rauschenberg and Warhol helped to usher in the parodic and simulacral sensibility anatomized by Fredric Jameson in <span style="font-style:italic;">Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</span>.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>And Johns? Like the other two painters, he rejects the "expressive fallacy," the belief that flinging paint on canvas expresses authentic, tumultuous emotion.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> Unlike them, he did not pursue this critique by switching to a flat, mechanical medium or by rejecting painterly gestures. He made the "death" of the unitary ego subtending the expressive fallacy an occasion for thinking through new ways of understanding an artist's relation to his creations. The "hand" of the artist became a "pressing" issue requiring investigation in a "hands-on" fashion. Moreover, whereas Rauschenberg and Warhol took the image as primary, Johns had long suspected that language was paramount. Rauschenberg's and Warhol's canvases are like screens against which pictures are mutely projected. In contrast, Johns's paintings, from <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> onwards, are sentence-like collocations of objects demanding to be "read" and meditated upon. Johns looked to poetry, not the movies or television, for his inspiration, and, by way of Crane, he was able mount a defense of traits supposedly spurned in the "cool" 1960s: affect, illusion, transcendence, monumentality, and handicraft.</p>
<p>In 1962, on the eve of Pop's explosive entrée into the New York art world, Johns dissented. He laid down a course for himself that employed certain but not all aspects of painterly high modernism. One could label this decision backwards-looking. Why, though, become embroiled in arguments over "late," "neo-," and "post-"? Why not speak of networks of affinity across time and place? Not revolutions, not movements, but a cooperative project that spans the twentieth century—as well as, it now appears, the twenty first. In 1997, Johns began <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge Suite</span>, a new series that employs a formal vocabulary derived largely from Crane's "To Brooklyn Bridge." The subject of Johns and Crane will soon require another study.</p>

<p>Writing to New York Public Library trustee Henry James in the spring of 1943, Left poet Muriel Rukeyser proposed an exhibition that would examine what she and her colleagues in the Office of War Information's Graphics Division called "the nature of total war."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The plan behind a series of single images may best be illustrated by such a series as the Graphics Division has carried out. The series on the Enemy does not show the Germans and the Japanese, for example, as brutalized and individual soldiers. It isolates a set of characteristics—suppression, starvation, slavery, torture, and murder—stamps them as the method of the enemy, and makes the positive answer of the United Nations: We t to Build a Free World. The qualities we t against are contained in the images; the answer which implements daily life in America, as we wish to see it functioning to t fascism, is contained in the text.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued"><span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span>, installed in a first-floor corridor of the NYPL's main branch on 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue, ran from June 18 to August 13, 1943. It was followed in the autumn by a weekly reading and discussion series whose participants included Rukeyser, exhibition coorganizer William Rose Benét, James Agee, W.H. Auden, Padraic Colum, Horace Gregory, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, Kenneth Patchen, and William Carlos Williams [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>].<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In its critical juxtaposition of text and visual image, <span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span> extended the Left avant-garde's earlier experimentation with the "social production of culture … and the new method of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> literary representation / production that accompanied it, <span style="font-style:italic;">factography.</span>"<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> As Benjamin H.D. Buchloch has argued, factography was the distillation of Soviet constructivism's effort not merely to apply modernism's technical innovations (particularly in film and photomontage) and formalist experimentation to a revolutionary context, but to involve artists "with materials and objects in actual space and the social processes that occur within it." In doing so, constructivists hoped to "transcend the historical limitations of modernism," moving from aesthetic mediation to direct participation in the processes of cultural production.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Rejecting liberalism's presumptive private/public divide and its geopolitical analogies, <span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span> contested many of the contradictions that emerged when earlier factographic and photomontage techniques were utilized in an already industrialized American context, contradictions that for Buchloch are exemplified by Herbert Bayer's photomurals for Edward Steichen's 1942 MoMA exhibition, <span style="font-style:italic;">Road to Victory</span>. The site of Rukeyser's exhibition is significant in this regard: its location in the NYPL's main corridor and its disjunctive, pedagogical technique emphasized "useful information and technical instruction," in direct contrast to MoMA's contemporaneous "modernization of what had come to be known among museum professionals as the 'aesthetic theory of museum management.'"<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Likewise, <span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span> retains a dialectical tension  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> between domestic American life and international fascism, implying that U.S. culture itself must be re-fashioned to counter totalitarianism both at home and abroad. Rather than channeling earlier leftwing political and artistic engagement directly into wartime propaganda, Rukeyser signals an ongoing conflict that emerged with the dismantling of the WPA, the move of "many arts projects participants … into the war information agencies," and the complex, mid-century transformation of American public culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Expanding Buchloch's narrow focus on the plastic and visual arts, Rukeyser's contemporaneous literary work explored the ways in which—as it interrogated the divisions of cultural labor that separate poetic technique from visual communication, historical knowledge, and political action—"the program of productivism and the methods of factographic production" informed specific literary/artistic projects, decades before these methods found more direct expression in the mid- to late-1960s.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In a globalizing postwar political landscape, domestic U.S. preoccupation with the production, transmission, and reception of networked information would reflect social as well as epistemological anxieties, especially at the site where these axes meet, a site that paradoxically appears, as a projected ral image, always to precede representation: the liberal citizen-subject.</p>
<p>Anticipating this shift by tracing its deeper history, in 1942 Rukeyser published a strangely hybrid "biography" of a nineteenth-century American physical chemist, Josiah Willard Gibbs, a text that reflects her future work at the OWI and on <span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span>. In her letter to Henry James, she writes that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[s]ince the publication of my book on Gibbs, I have been working in this Division, on government posters and picture books. We have been able, in the last six months, to develop graphically a number of basic war issues, and our hope has been to use this work as the foundation for the posters of everyday recommendations which are also part of the war.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ben Shahn's contribution to the Office of War Information's campaign against domestic racism, exhibited in <span style="font-style:italic;">Words at War</span>, exemplifies the "cultural front's" uneasy intersection of aesthetics and politics, reflected both in the relationship between the exposed, downturned face of the racially marked worker and the goggled, raised face of his foregrounded counterpart, and between that image and the underlying text [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. But Rukeyser's use of modernist documentary form is only one point of reference for her project. Anticipating the exhibition's factographic method and productivist program, but in a densely reflexive and paratactic style that assured the book an almost immediate obscurity, Rukeyser's study of Willard Gibbs also invokes what Sylvia Winter has called the "blurred genre" of "autosociography" that had been central to African-American culture's rejection of racial essentialism since the slave narrative form. The "explicitly Marxist analysis" of W.E.B. Du Bois's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dusk of Dawn: An Autobiography of the Race Concept</span>  and the more directly factographic form of Richard Wright and Edwin Rosskam's <span style="font-style:italic;">12 Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States</span>  were contemporaneous re-fashionings of this genre. In Brent Hayes Edwards's view, this hybrid poetics signals the "condition of possibility of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> emergence of a doctrine," the historical imperatives of a Black radical politics that extended through the WWII and Cold War periods, laying the groundwork for later, diasporic Black vanguard culture.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>In a curious relationship that is often noted but never explicated, <span style="font-style:italic;">Willard Gibbs</span> contained the most detailed available account of the 1839 rebellion on the slave-ship <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span>, an account that Rukeyser's fellow Left poet Robert Hayden utilized in constructing his landmark poem "Middle Passage." However, the complexity with which Hayden apparently read Rukeyser's source—decisively connecting his literary technique to his widely discussed historical revisionism and a poetics of transformation or metamorphosis that runs throughout his mature work—is barely suggested by his cursory note that the poem's third section "follows, in the main, the account of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> mutiny given by Muriel Rukeyser in her biography of Willard Gibbs."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Like Richard Wright, who in moving from the organized Communist movement and outside the territorial U.S. was initiating the post-nationalist project that would inform the remainder of his career, Hayden directly engaged the vexed relationship between modernity and race, grappling "with the big problem—the problem and meaning of Western civilization as a whole and the relation of Negroes and other minority groups to it."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Network of Cuts and Lines</h1>
<p>In his study of the post-WWII "organization complex," in which industrial capitalism's established divisions of labor were simultaneously preserved and transformed, Reinhold Martin states that "scientific knowledge and aesthetic strategies constantly change places in an epistemological blur."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Drawing upon the factographic tradition, but toward distinct ends, both Rukeyser and Hayden read this epistemological blur as performative, exposing an instrumental projection of socio-historical movement provided by liberal-democratic discourse (particularly the ideology of "uplift" as defined by judicial/legislative reform and embodied by a representative, emerging, and heroic middle class) and capitalism's global restructuring from the 1930s to the 1960s.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Bracketed by Roosevelt's New Deal and Johnson's Great Society, the long civil rights era was in this sense the product of a dual phenomenon: the Keynesian transformation of the liberal capitalist state during the 1930s and the emergence of black social movements that were urban, national, and transnational in scope and conception. The first created the conditions in which the classical liberal injunction to insulate market transactions from centralized state intervention was viewed as untenable, and in which nationalist principles of a social-democratic kind began to achieve an expanded purview over weakly integrated, racially stratified, state and local powers. The second constituted the social fact of racial inequality as a <span style="font-style:italic;">symbolic index</span> against which the achievement of U.S. civic ideals could be measured and the legitimacy of U.S. global aspirations could be assessed.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Shifting the entwined cultural and economic processes of domestic U.S. racialization to a global arena, this restructuring involved the very forms of subjectivity and citizenship, particularly across the core/periphery structure of public/private or national/ trans-national spheres, the consequent orders of knowledge that defined each, the systems by which the one was presumed to communicate with the other, and the modes by which the two halves of an incommensurate whole were represented.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> As Lani Guinier has argued, the nearly exclusive focus on de jure segregation leading up to the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Brown v. Board of Education</span> decision  led to a reversal of means and ends, whereby desegregation as a prerogative took the place of the meaningful redistribution of economic, social, and political power that desegregation was intended—in its public life—to promote. "This understandable preoccupation with de jure segregation disabled the [<span style="font-style:italic;">Brown</span>] plaintiffs' attorneys and their liberal allies from comprehending Jim Crow as the visible manifestation of a larger, constantly mutating racialized hierarchy."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Confronting this rapid mutation of means and ends, surface and depth, interest and divergence, Rukeyser and Hayden drew on the epistemological blurring by which factography extended and ultimately sought to transcend the legacy of modernist photomontage, in which "the network of cuts and lines of jutting edges and unmediated transitions from fragment to fragment was as important, if not more so, as the actual iconic representation contained within the fragment itself."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Reflecting the precedent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the Soviet constructivists in their attempted shift to productivism, but circumscribing U.S. culture and racialized liberalism in a global arena, Rukeyser and Hayden undertook overlapping and systematic historical investigations, rendering ironic the "quasi-scientific manner in which the constructivists … pursued their investigation of pictorial and sculptural constructs, <span style="font-style:italic;">as well as</span> the perceptual interaction with the viewer they generate."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Rukeyser and Hayden did so, like the constructivists, by developing a "systematic phenomenological grammar," not of the Western aesthetic tradition but of historical narratives and archives. Referencing Singh's "symbolic index," they did so by exploring "the material congruence of the sign with its signifying practice, on the causal relationship between the sign and its referent, and its focus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">indexical</span> status of the sign,"<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> in which the sign refers not a fixed, preceding object or reality as a one-to-one equivalent (as a photograph purports to do) but the social processes by which an apparently seamless reality and its dialectical negations are produced.</p>
<p>Exemplifying her revision of the constructivist project, and setting the stage for Hayden's similarly revisionist reading of her work, Rukeyser identifies her biographical plot as an open-ended mystery, framing (with the ral Gibbs) the inductive logic of the empirical sciences: "Who can solve the personality of a dead physical chemist?"<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> This is a mystery conventionally solved in advance by particular cultural narratives, including the structure of the Cartesian subject with its ahistorical, rationalist core and the contingent, peripheral surfaces of nation, class, race, and gender. Just as "the physical universe is the hero of our science," so scientific insight—explicitly coded as white, European, and masculine—is the hero of modernization.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Here Rukeyser directly engages the "speculative grammar" of Gibbs's friend and contemporary, the proto-semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly that method of logic that Peirce dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">retroduction</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">abduction</span>, utilized by cultural sleuths as diverse as Marx, Sherlock Holmes, and Freud. In contrast to induction's move from specific case to general rule, abduction runs from general rule to specific case, a difference that Peirce argued was not simply a symmetrical reversal:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The great difference between induction and hypothesis [i.e., abduction] is, that the former infers the existence of phenomena such as we have observed in cases which are similar, while hypothesis supposes something of a different kind from what we have directly observed, and frequently something which it would be impossible for us to observe directly.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Paradoxically, however, abduction is initiated with the observable clue, which as Rosalind Krauss has written,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>is precisely what was not meant, was never considered, what was inadvertent, unconscious, left by mistake. The clue is structured by the peculiar fact that though, as a trace, it is ineradicably connected to its "maker," its maker's connection to <span style="font-style:italic;">it</span> cannot be said to have the same perspicuousness. And with this slackening of the criminal's grip on the "meaning" of his own clue, his story likewise passes out of his hands, becoming a newly born narrative. No longer the tale of the crime's commission, it is now the story of the deed's detection.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> As Holmes liked to explain to Watson, it becomes a matter of "reasoning backwards."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Encompassing "the deed's detection" as well as "the tale of the crime's commission," Rukeyser read the surfaces and deeper historical implications of Gibbs's work in physical chemistry through the socio-historical lens of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> rebellion and trial. Her method was subsequently extended by Robert Hayden—against the inductive grain of established historiography—through the "void" to which the still-unfolding crime of the Atlantic slave-trade had, as unmoored signs, been largely consigned by liberalism's abolitionist and integrationist master-narratives. In transition from the lyric mode of his Popular Front writing to a more radical "instrument of significant silence," Hayden articulated race as an irreducible historical form, connecting literary practice to a cultural and political vanguard engaged explicitly with the intertwined processes of domestic anti-racism, global capitalism, and decolonization.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">War's Recording Surface, Its Film</h1>
<p>Tracing a speculative historical grammar through the "personality" of Willard Gibbs, Rukeyser signals her dual engagement with Marxism and psychoanalysis, anticipating the deconstruction of the Cartesian subject carried out by structural semiotics in the postwar decades. In doing so, she invokes Kenneth Burke's contemporaneous critical project, in which "the older, philosophical systems" of textual criticism are "piled in one after the other to be melted down and lose their separate identities," "in which the practice of idiosyncratic and sometimes eccentric textual interpretations is at one with the projection of a powerful theoretical resonance."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> As for Burke, the blurring effect of Rukeyser's formal ex-centricity is directed against the centralizing pressures of American culture under wartime conditions, a conflict that for the poet emerged publicly, so to speak, only with the official entry of the United States into WWII, but that could be read abductively as a central structuring principle of U.S. history from the ground up. Against the surface/depth or re/ground distinctions on which biographical ration is normatively structured, however, Rukeyser's speculative theoretical resonance is felt immediately as a restless, indexical surface-effect of the writing itself.</p>
<p>F.O. Matthiessen, reviewing Rukeyser's prize-winning first volume of poetry, <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Flight</span> , complained that the poet's words were "too flowingly allusive and often leave a blurred effiect."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Rukeyser's subsequent, explicitly factographic collection <span style="font-style:italic;">U.S. 1</span>  "uses poetry to 'extend the document,'" paradoxically turning both reflexively and ex-centrically toward the archive and other institutional contexts through which the orders of meaning are authorized.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> This equivocal passage between blur and extended document is driven to a crisis-point in Rukeyser's 1939 collection <span style="font-style:italic;">A Turning Wind</span>, with its explicit reference to Burke's 1937 <span style="font-style:italic;">Attitudes Toward History</span>, in which Burke contrasts the governing aeronautical trope of <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Flight</span> with the Futurist Marinetti's "sentimental acceptance" of technological positivism (exemplified by the aircraft as transcendental machine).<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Inserted into a series of historical "correspondences,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Gibbs is linked to other transgressive, formally hybrid or vanguard res of American radical culture, including painter Albert Pinkham Ryder, poet and essayist John Jay Chapman, Communist labor organizer Ann Burlak, and composer Charles Ives. Anticipating a technique she explored more fully in her later work, this analytic sequence developed factography's serial, informational-feedback method, identifying the subject as an effect of displacement among competing or interactive codes. Rukeyser thus invokes what constructivist theoretician Sergei Tret'iakov earlier called</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>the "biography of an object." By telling the spectator about objects these "biographies" should make the objects capable of informing him also about the people who use them. So the photographic sequences of the "factographers" are constructed to show "not the individual human being who passes through the system of objects, but the object which passes through the system of human beings."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Signaling her interrogation of the biographical re and the Western Enlightenment's subtending retinal model of knowledge, Rukeyser opens her biography with a super-subjective, prosthetic camera-eye: in 1839, the year of Gibbs's birth, "[t]he world was extending itself":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Europe was full, as it had always been, of self-destruction; America was gathering itself together for leap after leap to the west; Asia was vast and unsuspected to the rest, Africa open only at the edges, and there being bled for everybody's profit. We have to stand far off and see the world turning, its sands, its green, its mountains, its little colored towns, farther and farther off until the thoughts of people are a blur, the world is a blur of a hundred years ago. The round blurred earth, a hundred years ago to our presumption, and there are two ships visible on the curve of its blue oceans. Two ships unconscious of each other, sailing different seas, and carrying vastly different cargoes. But closely interlocked for us now, rocking on their oceans a hundred years ago.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">One of these ships was "the <span style="font-style:italic;">Java</span>, a three-master, sailing from Rotterdam to Surabaya, carrying 100,000 bricks and Robert Mayer."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> As ship's surgeon on this voyage, Mayer discovered the laws governing the conservation of energy—the foundation of modern thermodynamics—first by drawing a visual analogy to the human circulatory system, then by adapting that model in the face of empirical difference. The other vessel was the slave-ship <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span>, the rebellion of whose human cargo—marked by the visual system of racial categories—and that cargo's subsequent re-capture and trial marked a defining limit case of the American civic imaginary. Rukeyser sets these vessels on a collision course, not with each other but with the deeper, global conflict of which they are (literally) floating signifiers.</p>
<p>Rukeyser here foregrounds not relationality <span style="font-style:italic;">per se—</span>the aesthetic "free-play" that she, like Burke, opposed to "historical necessity" rather than scientific "truth"—but the specific geopolitical relations marked by the U.S. entry into WWII, represented initially by the converging seas on which the <span style="font-style:italic;">Java</span> (Pacific) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> (Atlantic) respectively sail. Rukeyser thus positions the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> within modernization's epic, developmental narrative, an irony marked by "the adventure of the system-building  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> spirit in the time of the breaking of systems …"<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> As she argues, the direct outcome of Gibbs's pioneering theoretical work would be the highly ambivalent transformation of American industry into a post-national model, based not only upon the synthetic chemical processes for which Gibbs laid the theoretical groundwork but upon the multinational corporations that exploited those processes while concealing their roots in established colonial relations. These corporations notably included the Aluminum Corporation of America (Alcoa) and I.G. Farben, created or transformed after WWI to skirt the Versailles Treaty's restructuring of imperial boundaries. Through this global structure, which Rukeyser plots not as an effect of Wilsonianism but at the very heart of the nativistic Jacksonian republic and the origins of the American industrial revolution (and thus both metaphor and metonymy of earlier European colonialism and the slave-trade), Rukeyser explicitly re-reads the work of the "progressive" U.S. historians, particularly Charles and Mary Beard's economic critique of Frederick Jackson Turner's "frontier thesis" and its emphasis on local-regional autonomy; it is the "Middle Period of the United States, the period surrounding the Civil War, [that includes] the years of Willard Gibbs."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> ring this middle passage from frontier republic to empire, from mercantilism to trans-national capital, post-industrialism, and globalization, Gibbs frames the differential between "the worker in pure imagination: scientist, poet, abstract artist, pioneer of system" and the War as a putative structural breakdown.</p>
<p>Exemplifying Rukeyser's abductive method, the ironies that characterize Gibbs and his legacy also prere him. Arriving in New Haven on September 1, 1839—the place and year of Gibbs's birth—the apprehended <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> captives, abjectly beyond any contemporary concept of citizenship, were themselves in a privileged position to view the transformations Gibbs will embody as at once a structural outgrowth of earlier principles—theirs was a journey <span style="font-style:italic;">in reverse</span> through U.S. history, a reversal especially important to Hayden's revision of Rukeyser—and the alchemical transmutation of those principles. In contrast to the captives' point of origin in West Africa, their passage through "angled Havana," their months on a zig-zagging course through the mid-Atlantic,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[t]his color that they saw, these flickering delicate elms, the wide sweep of the Green, the profound sky—nothing in the tropics, nothing on the sea, could have predicted this! But there was more; for past the avenues of feathers gleamed <span style="font-style:italic;">a whiteness never seen before</span>, in soft round pillars rising as marble never seen before, <span style="font-style:italic;">a new and enchanting whiteness</span>, fluted intricately, and rising to support great shapes that floated like <span style="font-style:italic;">white reefs</span> over these <span style="font-style:italic;">pale and columned porches</span>, whose steps rose up to them in <span style="font-style:italic;">the whiteness of astounding sand</span>…<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Stuttering with traumatic repetition, this filmic passage returns to the prosthetic camera-eye by which "the world was extending itself." Rukeyser's heuristic visual medium rises into a super-natural blurring of instrumental differences, echoing the rhythmic return to a transred (and transring) whiteness: a mutating, baroque surface that conceals the rationalist, neo-classical architecture within.</p>
<p>With a complex cosmopolitanism that distinguishes it from New England's earlier  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> colonial elites, New Haven is model for the more extensive structure in which the poet is interested. As <span style="font-style:italic;">genius loci</span>,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[t]he hub of this Green is Center Church, a beautiful traditional building modeled after St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, in London. With one difference. The two cornerstones of Center Church are two monuments set up to Goffe and Whalley, the regicides—two of those judges who condemned Charles I to death, and fled England at the Restoration. King-killers! Breakers of the deepest tabu of any ruled people. Three of these men had been concealed and protected in New Haven, and took their lives up again. Their graves are in the church's cornerstones. But it is high explosive that is buried in that gesture: violence, and daring, and the promise of new freedoms. And that, in a quiet town, accepting gracefully the limits of its high red palisades of rock and its curve of Sound—accepting its church, its college, its law.</p>
<p>But buried in its center, the hub of an American city, are those cornerstones.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The trial of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> captives revolved around this repressed revolutionary axis (explicitly urban and global, <span style="font-style:italic;">contra</span> Turner's regional and pastoral nostalgia) and its phantasmagorical white surfaces, a trial that took place two years after Andrew Jackson left office and a decade into the "high noon of the white republic."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Former President John Quincy Adams would famously lead the defense of the captives, arguing their natural right to individual self-determination, regardless of treaty conventions. First, however, a more pragmatic issue had to be resolved: would the captives themselves be permitted to speak, and if so, how would their words be heard? What would be the language of that exchange? After hiring council and following the appointment of a defense committee, "[t]he main problem now was one of <span style="font-style:italic;">communication.</span>"<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Gibbs's father, after whom Gibbs was named, was a professor of theology and sacred literatures at Yale. At the time of the New Haven <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> trial, he "had devoted his forty-nine years to religion, to the language of religion, and to the new comparative study of languages which German scholarship, in the early years of the century, was illuminating as a study of the nature of man expressed in his words, the sounds and the structure of their various grammars."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Emblematic of modernization, as the rationalization of racial practices was systematically shifted from a religious to a secular or scientific base, so hermeneutics moved from the study of scriptural transmission to the study of "natural" languages in translation, from the exchange of signs to a system of communicative networks by which such exchange could be developed and regulated.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Representing the deep social grammar on which Rukeyser is really focused, Josiah Gibbs had the captives count from one to ten, noting the phonetic equivalences of the English numerical system. He then traveled to New York City and walked the docks of Lower Manhattan, enunciating those syllables until he got a positive response from Mendi-speaking sailors who had been "liberated" from blockaded slave-ships and immediately impressed into the British Navy. The elder Gibbs returned with these sailors to New Haven, where they served as interpreters at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> trial.</p>
<p>Josiah Gibbs developed a hermeneutic model that reflected, as Rukeyser argues, a mid-nineteenth century modernization of American education and the public sphere  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that corresponded to a similar transformation occurring in the period around WWII. This hermeneutic model would inform Willard Gibbs's innovative scientific work as well as the respective synthetic or interdisciplinary projects of C.S. Peirce (in logic and semiotics), William James (in philosophy), and Henry Adams (in historiography). The elder Gibbs's role in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> trial also emblematizes an anti-systematic "pragmaticism" that anticipates Peirce and James by reacting to dominant empiricist models and charting a middle course between Darwin and Emerson.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Gibbs's British contemporary and friend, Clerk Maxwell, would exemplify this trajectory by developing "the theory of goalseeking or cybernetic devices" out of the simple analog computers of the time: the flyball governor, the map, the clock, the ruler, the thermometer, the volume control, the accelerator pedal, the sextant, and the protractor.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Rukeyser notes the irony that Willard Gibbs's focus on the representation of "internal relations" did not translate immediately to the language of physical chemistry, a translation that would, with ambivalent results, enable the practical, industrial application of Gibbs's principles. Maxwell, however, "went even farther."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The surface had been described, but again Willard Gibbs had stopped at the bare idea and left undone that step which might have bridged the gap between himself and his audience. Maxwell added the last personal expression, which must have touched and delighted Gibbs more than any other gift. They were both scientists using the most contemporary methods of making models and discarding them in time, instead of submitting to them, as did Lord Kelvin, for example.</p>
<p>Gibbs had not made a model. He had fallen short. Maxwell did that, sending a plaster statue to Gibbs in New Haven, and keeping two others for the Cavendish Laboratory.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The white contours of Maxwell's "statue of water"—perhaps the first non-objective sculpture, based not on mimetic resemblance but on the representation of non-visual relations, and in Rukeyser's book directly juxtaposed with a ral portrait of Gibbs— ironically recalls the intimate binding of space and time, the "new and enchanting whiteness" that for Rukeyser marked the simultaneously prosthetic and synthetic vision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> captives, reading ironically across American liberalism's public/ private divide.</p>
<p>In his pioneering papers "Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids" , "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermo-dynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces" , and "The Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" (1876–78), Gibbs explored methods by which chemical processes are represented, transforming the static, two-dimensional model that had been the norm in the empirical sciences to that point, a model that generally mapped only volume and pressure as rectilinear coordinates. The problem presented by the science of thermodynamics is one of complexity, simultaneity, and difference, as it is concerned with "two forms of the same thing: energy and entropy. [Gibbs] is absorbed in the problem of equilibrium between two or many components. He is dealing with the behavior of the components, whatever they may be, and the system, whatever it become."  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Predecessors such as Carnot, Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz, Clausius, Kelvin, and Rankine, "inspired by the behavior of steam inside an engine cylinder, were fascinated by its <span style="font-style:italic;">public life</span>. Gibbs, moving ahead, was concerned with internal relations, in the 'private life of systems.'"<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Contemporary Slavery, Historical Form</h1>
<p>It is in this striking formulation that the complex exchange between <span style="font-style:italic;">Willard Gibbs</span> and "Middle Passage" is most clearly legible. Hayden's poem was first published in Du Bois's <span style="font-style:italic;">Phylon</span> in 1945, but was dramatically revised for the annual Popular Front journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Cross-Section</span> in 1946, with Hayden excising the conventional epic framework that he'd originally given the poem. Displacing epic with factography, these cuts effectively heightened <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the poem's iconic, documentary moments <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the indexical tensions of its textual elements. As Vera Kutzinksi argues, Hayden's editing produced "the absence of a central, controlling consciousness or 'voice' in the poem,"<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> an absence that only emphasizes the poem's multiple mediations, its function as a constructed space. While Hayden creates "images of language, of the discourse of slavery, without claims to representational authority and historical truth," his textual weave reflects a consistent motivation: Hayden's sources "all have to do, directly or indirectly, with slave mutinies."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Like Rukeyser, Hayden explores the passage from blur to extended document, but in doing so he decisively articulates both a revolutionary core as well as the concealing surfaces of a "new and enchanting whiteness."</p>
<p>The poem focuses immediately on the rhetoric and grammar of motives, from the lists of slave-ship names—<span style="font-style:italic;">Jesús, Estrella, Esperanza, Mercy—</span>that project into the white space of the page, collectively becoming the subject of the stanza that follows: "Sails flashing to the wind like weapons,/sharks following the moans the fever and the dying;/ horror the corposant and compass rose." While these powerful images document the material history of the Atlantic slave-trade, the iconic quality of the names is displaced metonymically by the "sails," the "sharks," the "horror" that mark the ships' progress across the Atlantic. Through the intersection of corposant (or St. Elmo's Fire, the ball of light sometimes seen on a ship's masts or rigging during a storm) and compass rose, Hayden also "relays the equivocal character" of modernity's projective practices, simultaneously "the action of projecting images on a screen and the representation of a volume on a flat surface": "Spectacle and geometry, fields of activity far from each other, are mixed in the same word. With the slide or the film, it is nonetheless a matter of a comparable result: a volume transferred to a surface, illusion and geometric codification, mirage and science."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> The lists of ship's names—names that twelve lines later shift from Spanish to the English of <span style="font-style:italic;">Desire, Adventure, Tartar, Ann—</span>reflect not only the "increasing secularization of the language of slavery" from the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as Vera Kutzinski has argued, but the displacement of Spanish by English as the dominant language of an imperialist world system.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The documentary fragment that separates the Spanish and English names likewise embeds within itself the clash of signifying systems and a corresponding hermeneutics that attempts to mediate or regulate that clash, a mediation in which comprehension and control are inseparable imperatives: "'10 April 1800 —/ Blacks rebellious. Crew uneasy. Our linguist says / their moaning is a prayer for death, / ours and their own."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Hayden thus heightens the ironies of Rukeyser's account, in which the putative openness of communication between English and Mendi simply equilibrates the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> captives as subjects before U.S. law, in which liberty is already foreclosed or circumscribed by the autonomous liberal subject and the ascriptive racial practices on which it rests.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> The reader is forced against the narrative voices that insistently displace a ral representation of the enslaved; in this, Hayden invokes a form of allegory that Gayatri Spivak discusses in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Critique of Postcolonial Reason,</span> summarized by Brent Hayes Edwards as "parabasis, 'the activism of <span style="font-style:italic;">speaking otherwise</span>.' Allegory is a practice of 'persistent interruption' in language where the cognitive or epistemological is continually breached by the performative or ethical, forcing the attentive reader to move against the current of the prose, to hear the charge of what it pushes away." The poem's contradictory modes thus constitute the allegory equated by Paul de Man with irony, which he defines as "'the sudden revelation of the discontinuity between two rhetorical codes.'"<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In Hayden's own words, the opening section of "Middle Passage," "adapted from ships' logs, eye-witness accounts by traders, depositions," introduces "the motifs, the themes, of the poem—man's cruelty to man, the Negro's heroic struggle to be free. Irony is a constant element throughout the poem."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Through this factographic method, unbinding projection's embedded contradictions, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> uprising's representative heroic re, Cinquez, joins vanguard predecessors and antecedents such as Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Fredrick Douglass to form a system of correspondences, a radical counter-history in which public and private lives intersect in a collective "<span style="font-style:italic;">subject</span> of insurgency."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Revising Rukeyser's exploration of this subject in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Turning Wind</span>'s analytic sequence, Hayden also contributes here to a larger problematic, visible in the on-going efforts of Du Bois and others to rethink Black radical politics beyond "outbursts of merely 'episodic value'" within Marxism's historic conception of class struggle. <span style="font-style:italic;">Loa</span>-like, historical conflict takes possession of received meanings, constructing in indexical form what Ranajit Guha "calls the 'consciousness of insurgency' within a 'discourse of counter-insurgency'—that is, within the archives of colonialism and within the recesses of traditional bourgeois historiography."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> At the same time, implicitly linking Rukeyser's model with the abstract patterning of traditional West African textile designs and their African-American counterparts, Hayden's textual weave gives substantive volume to an instrumental void, generating the blur of a medium that meets and exceeds <span style="font-style:italic;">either/or</span> racial (and other) binaries, a medium that abductively reads <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> volume <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> void as constitutive of meaning.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the poem's first section, lines from the Baptist hymn "Jesus Savior Pilot Me" echo the salvation narrative encoded in the slave-ship names, registering "as counterpoint, as ironic commentary perhaps" on the multiple interpellations of the Middle Passage, the systematic stripping away of previously constructed African cultural identities during the production of the slave subject.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> The uniformly capitalized words of these lines are pushed apart by their spacing, prolonging their duration and emphasizing internal disjunction, while as a single but fractured syntactic unit they rhythmically disrupt the first-person testimony of the unnamed "Deponent," who as a slave-ship's doctor joins the "linguist" in representing European modernity's forms of clinical/scientific authority and control. The retinal bias of these projective forms—particularly in racial codification—is red ironically in the optical blindness  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> described by the doctor: a "plague among our blacks" has spread even to the "Capt.'s eyes" and the ship's "fo'c'sle," transgressing but re-absorbing the hierarchies built into the slave-ship's marine architecture.</p>
<p>Balancing the opening section's anti-absorptive montage effect, the poem's iconic second section presents "the reminiscences of an old slave-trader," a "composite" narrative "meant to suggest a ballad …"</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Aye, lad, and I have seen those factories,<br>Gambia, Rio Pongo, Calabar;<br>have watched the artful mongos baiting traps<br>of war wherein the victor and the vanquished</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Were caught as prizes for our barracoons.<br>Have seen the nigger kinds whose vanity<br>and greed turned wild black hides of Fellatah,<br>Mandingo, Ibo, Kru to gold for us.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Through the ballad's explicitly "folk" form, Hayden contrasts a vernacular documentary fragment to the earlier, almost Kafkaesque legal testimony given by the "Deponent," forcing the reader "to move against the current of the prose, to hear the charge of what it pushes away." Hayden thus exposes the putative primordialism of such vernacular forms as in fact the product of modernity's projective practices. Gamba, Rio Pongo, and Calabar are "factories" (a word repeated twice in this brief section) not simply for the production of modernity's racialized subjects but of a uniform, universally extendable space and linear time against which the simultaneously observed and observing subject is projected.</p>
<p>The return to a more complex textual weave in the poem's concluding section, in which Hayden draws most directly from Rukeyser's source-text, is signaled literally: "Shuttles in the rocking loom of history, / the dark ships move, the dark ships move, / their bright ironical names / like jests of kindness on a murderer's mouth." It is this disembodied "murderer's mouth," nominally that of the Spanish slave-trader Pedro Montez, that narrates the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> rebellion to a putatively American audience, pointing out the paradox</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty<br>are rooted in the labor of your slaves<br>should suffer the august John Quincy Adams<br>to speak with so much passion of the right<br>of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters<br>and with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero's<br>garland for Cinquez.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, Cinquez is framed abductively as an heroic, neo-classical rhetorical re, a point of ironic enunciation for an underlying racial grammar. This rhetorical re's ethical equivocations, its performative status, are clearly framed by the consistent referent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> displaced by the poem's documentary or iconic moments: the recurrence of slave mutinies. As Kutzinski has argued, Hayden is working through contradictions within the rhetoric of slavery, just as the abolitionists had, but does so in order to frame the equally contradictory rhetoric of liberalism, embodied in John Quincy Adam's "stale neo-classical clichés."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> By blurring and extending the documents of historical slavery, "Middle Passage" also engages the enduring or even proliferating conditions of "neo-slavery" contested by Black diasporic artists and activists in the post-WWII period, reframing a radical tradition that was born of the same historical correspondences— constructive of an ongoing, diasporic Afro-modernity—that Hayden identified in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Ballad of Remembrance</span> with Nat Turner, Cinquez, Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass, and later, in <span style="font-style:italic;">American Journal</span> (1978; rev. 1982) with Phillis Wheatley, John Brown, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Paul Robeson.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, I concur with Vera Kutzinski's conclusion that Hayden uses the Atlantic slave-trade to frame a particular discourse of freedom, conceived in liberal-democratic theory primarily as a control of signifiers. "Middle Passage" takes the process of signification—a racialized grammar of motives—as its subject. Once again, in this respect, factographic form itself encodes the revolutionary struggle to involve artists "with materials and objects in actual space and the social processes that occur within it," as Benjamin H.D. Buchloch has argued. In the poem's opening section, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span> is paraphrased: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Deep in the festering hold thy father lies,</span> / <span style="font-style:italic;">of his bones New England pews are made</span>, / <span style="font-style:italic;">those are altar lights that were his eyes</span>." The response to this call comes in the final section, augured by Hayden's repetition of the governing visual trope: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, / the corpse of mercy rots with him, / rats eat love's rotten gelid eyes. // But, oh, the living look at you with human eyes whose suffering accuses you, / whose hatred reaches through the swill of dark / to strike you like a leper's claw. // You cannot stare that hatred down or chain the fear that stalks the watches / and breathes upon you its fetid scorching breath; / cannot kill the deep immortal human wish, / the timeless will</span>." Hayden himself stated that this internal dialogue suggests "an ironic relationship" between Shakespeare's "themes of death and metamorphosis" and the idea that "there was some connection between the sea-change [Shakespeare] describes and the change from human beings into things, objects, suffered by enslaved Africans. This and the idea that slavery was a kind of death."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Similarly, Hayden sought "to correct the misconceptions and to destroy some of the stereotypes and clichés which surround Negro history."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Immediately following the repetition and difference of this paraphrase, the text shifts from Shakespeare to Rukeyser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> account, and as Kuzinski argues, one of the striking marks of Hayden's revision of that account is the framing device of the storm, narrated by Montez: "'But for the storm that flung up barriers / of wind and wave, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Amistad</span>, señores, / would have reached the port of Príncipe in two, / three days at most; but for the storm we should / have been prepared for what befell.'"<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>This ironic testimony, interpolated by Hayden into his source-text, suggests a further connection between Hayden's final, complex image and Shakespeare's play, in which the opening storm is not actually the dissolution of existing relations but the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> resolution of the play's back-story, not the metaphoric icon of a natural world but a metonymic index of social motives (Prospero's revenge against his usurping brother, Antonio). In this sense, the storm displaces the enchanting, phantasmagoric whiteness that Rukeyser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> captives observe upon their arrival at New Haven, a whiteness that they alone, for the very reason of their otherness to Western Enlightenment and its structural presumptions, have the vision both to <span style="font-style:italic;">see</span> and to <span style="font-style:italic;">see through</span>. As Kevin Gaines has recently demonstrated, Shakespeare's play performed an important role in the advent of a particular genre of writing by diasporic Black intellectuals in the period of African decolonization, a genre that extends the material movement of people and ideas embodied by the 1956 First World Conference of Negro Writers in Paris. These gatherings, Gaines writes, "as part of the widely anticipated demise of colonialism, fostered throughout the 1950s and early '60s a growing body of travel writing by African-descended writers, along with localized reflections on African-American or African Caribbean identity." An important example of this emergent genre is Barbadian writer George Lamming's 1960 essay collection <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pleasures of Exile</span>, "based in part on visits to West Africa and the US during the 1950s … In <span style="font-style:italic;">Pleasures</span>, Lamming frequently invoked <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span> as a central trope to re the altered balance of power between the colonizer and the colonized, symbolized by Prospero and his oppressive magic, and Caliban, his rebellious former slave who has appropriated the 'gift' of Prospero's language, that is, Westernization, as a weapon against foreign rule."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Shipwreck of the Singular</h1>
<p>Reading a global endgame abductively into U.S. history, countering "paranoid organicism on the one hand, entropic dissipation on the other," Rukeyser anticipates America's postwar romance with cybernetics and "new media."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> By resisting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span>'s absorption into liberalism's teleological narratives, and the reduction of the rebellion to a single, heroic, and ultimately foreclosed image, Hayden points Rukeyser's investigative poetics further toward a cultural and historical productivism, embodied by the "deathless primaveral image" of Cinquez, that was explored contemporaneously by the internationalist, anti-colonial vanguard of W.E.B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Shirley Graham, W. Alphaeus Hutton, Richard Wright, Julian Mayfield, Lorraine Hansberry, and C.L.R. James. Seeking a nonaligned "third way" between Cold War binaries, this vanguard "spoke to issues at the center of the reshaping of America in the post-World War Two era: the relationship of the United States to emerging Asian and African nations; definitions of democracy, freedom, and the very meaning of American citizenship and what it entailed; how political, economic, and civil rights were to be defined and who in America and across the globe was to have access to those rights." Penny Von Eschen argues that this diasporic vanguard was itself an index of the war's instrumental crises and the technological advances those crises heralded: as "wartime political alliances and innovations in mass communications radically altered the boundaries of the possible, this shared democratic vision gave rise to new political strategies."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Awareness of the complexity of New World African cultural performances has revised a conception of the historical Middle Passage solely as a void or as "a phenomenon of constricted space and limited time." Since Hayden's pioneering example, and implicitly following the ex-centricity of Rukeyser's factographic model, scholarship has extended the meaning of that passage "in time and space from the particularities of internal African migration to current meditations on the relationship of African Americans to their past, from the hierarchical spatial relationships of above/below (the deck of the slave ship and its hold) and center/periphery (e.g., the Great House and the slave quarters; in a more abstract sense, the primarily European construction of an Africa as well as an African diaspora outside of history) to the syncretic notion of a space in-between that links geographical and cultural regions."<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Rukeyser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Willard Gibbs</span> remained out of print for more than four decades before being reprinted by small Ox Bow Press in 1988, but the <span style="font-style:italic;">Amistad</span> chapter was excised to appear first in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Twice-A-Year</span> in 1942 and in a late manifestation of Popular Front culture, the 1946 anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Primer for White Folks</span>; there it accompanied an excerpt from Du Bois's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Negro</span> on "African Culture," Richard Wright's "The Ethics of Living Jim Crow," Langston Hughes's "What Shall We Do About the South?", "Democracy is for the Unafraid," by Chester Himes, and "Addressed to White Liberals," by Lillian Smith.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> In contrast, the final version of "Middle Passage" appeared in Hayden's 1962 <span style="font-style:italic;">A Ballad of Remembrance</span>, the first volume in Dutch scholar and publisher Paul Breman's pioneering "Heritage" series. This vanguard collection, the significance of which would be recognized by Langston Hughes and other judges at the First World Festival of Negro Arts, held in Dakar, Senegal in April 1966, appears to have little in common either formally or conceptually with Hayden's 1940 "'prentice" collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Heart-Shape in the Dust</span>.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> In fact, as Pontheolla Williams has pointed out, the earlier volume already demonstrates Hayden's attempt to combine Popular Front Marxism, a Romantic-symbolist aesthetic inspired by the poet's reading of the Anglo-American poetic tradition, the lyric, vernacular "voice" and folk materials associated most prominently with Hughes, Sterling Brown, and Zora Neale Hurston, and the fragmentary, largely vernacular archive of African-American and diasporic history.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">A Ballad of Remembrance</span> also reflects the dramatic technical transformation marked by Hayden's second collection (a surrealist- and symbolist-inflected collaboration with Myron O'Higgins) <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lion and the Archer</span>, published in 1948 by Nashville's Hemphill Press, founded by Hayden and other Fisk poets for whom publishing venues were nonexistent.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the factographic method that Hayden clearly read in and through Rukeyser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Willard Gibbs</span> works its ironies against reified or instrumental forms of communication, consumerist individuation, and the Cold War logic of strategic decentralization, techniques associated with the postwar "control society." Exemplifying the contradictory forms taken by the modernist legacy in the post-WWII period, and extending factography's feedback model into the era of de-colonization and globalization, both poets move from representation (as a practice of ral projection) to construction, treating historical documentation not as icon but index, in which  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "[t]ruth is understood as a matter of evidence, rather than a function of logic."<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Rather than attempting to escape mediation and the legacy of modernism altogether, as the Soviet productivists had sought to do, Rukeyser and Hayden pose the inescapably historical questions by which Western modernity lays bare its internal contradictions: what is the nature of the work of art through which conflicting communities and cultural traditions are linked, conflict that the entwined concepts of liberal discourse and communication—as the meeting of already equilibrated representatives—tends to erase rather than confront? How does the artist engage "system" as such, when it is systematic complexity that appears to overwhelm the individual subject and to obscure ongoing, historical inequalities? Invoking the cultural narratives on which psychoanalysis as well as historiography are based, these questions will frame radical Black artistic practices and its caustic dialogue with modernism after WWII.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Pioneered by Du Bois, Fanon, and a host of writers and artists, these practices re-frame the intersection of private-psychological and public-social structures, contesting U.S. culture as it passed from "the 1940s critique of colonialism, imperialism, and racism to the dehistoricized version of racism, stripped of all analysis of political economy, that flourished in the Cold War era."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of the obscurity into which Rukeyser's factographic model has fallen, the paradoxes of Hayden's revision of that model became especially acute in the poet's <span style="font-style:italic;">annus mirabilis</span> of 1966, "a year of extremes" in which, following the liberal watershed of the 1964–65 Voting Rights and Civil Rights Acts, the poet was awarded <span style="font-style:italic;">le Grand Prix de Poésie</span> (presented by Kwame Nkrumah) while being viciously attacked at the first Black Writers' Conference, organized at Fisk by novelist John Oliver Killens. However damaging to Hayden personally, the legible ironies of this conflict—in light of the still-metastasizing "war on terror," globalization's out-sourcing of U.S. gender, race, and class inequities, and the continuing recourse to "historical slavery" as a triumphant morality tale of Western liberalism—seem precisely the point.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  Alongside the well-known controversy about the coming of sound, the history of early cinema also includes a debate about titling: words printed on the silent screen. Anita Loos, a screenwriter and author of the best-selling 1925 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span>, developed a mode of writing in which literature and cinema unmoored the conventional relationship of the image to the word. Taken together, Loos’s titles and her novel show a cross-genre relationship of exchange that has the effect of reconceiving language and image. At a transitional moment when literary institutions were changing and the cinema was being born, Loos invents new forms of vernacular pleasure: the literary cinema, and the cinematic novel.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
      Anita Loos’s bestselling 1925 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span> has been all but eclipsed by the voluptuous shadow of Marilyn Monroe. Any text would have trouble competing with Monroe’s sugar spun hair, bursting bodice, and slick lipstick pout in Howard Hawks’s 1953 film adaptation of Loos’s novel. In its own time, however, few popular novels generated as much attention from both general readers and cultural critics of note. Well into the 1930s and 1940s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span> had considerable cultural traction and was adapted to nearly every medium imaginable—magazine, stage play, silent film, musical, sound film, comic strip, dress fabric, and wallpaper.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> While the novel’s superficial signifiers (champagne, diamonds, and dancing vamps) could be captured on film or paper a room, its most important characteristic, its voice, was paradoxically silenced with the coming of the sound film. This outcome is particularly striking given that Loos’s novel is fashioned from a convergence of literature and film.
    </p>
<p>
      The narrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> is Lorelei Lee, a gold-digging ditz who spends most of her time wheedling jewelry out of her paramours, shopping, dining at fashionable clubs, or lounging in her “negligay.” Lorelei is a sybarite who, when traveling in France with her sugar daddy, “Gus Eisman the Button King,” and her sardonic best friend, Dorothy, frets that she can not “tell how much francs is in money,” but decides that “Paris is devine” when she sees “famous historical names, like Coty and Cartier” along with the “Eyefull Tower.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> She begins keeping a diary when one of her admirers urges her to put her thoughts down on paper. “It would be strange if I turn out to be an authoress,” she muses. “I  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mean I simply could not sit for hours and hours at a time practising just for the sake of a career. . . . But writing is different because you do not have to learn or practise” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 4–5). While writing appeals to Lorelei, she confides, “The only career I would like to be besides an authoress is a cinema star” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 6).
    </p>
<p>
      Critics of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, from its initial appearance to now, have taken their cue from Lorelei’s two aspirations (cinema and literature) and have tried to place the novel in the cultural spectrum from mass culture to modernism. For Q. D. Leavis, Cyril Connolly, and Wyndham Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> epitomizes popular culture’s frivolity and idioms of idiocy. However, James Joyce, H. L. Mencken, Aldous Huxley, William Empson, George Santayana, Edith Wharton, and William Faulkner were positively giddy in their embrace of the novel. Mencken, Loos’s friend whose predilection for dim-witted platinum beauties was said to have inspired <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, wrote in a review, “This gay book has filled me with uproarious and salubrious mirth. It is farce—but farce full of shrewd observation and devastating irony” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, xi). Others who had no personal connection to Loos at the time were similarly enthralled. Huxley wrote that he was “enraptured by the book.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1926, Joyce wrote to Harriet Shaw Weaver that he had been “reclining on a sofa and reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span> for three whole days,” an image that ratively reverses Eve Arnold’s 1955 photograph of Monroe in a bathing suit reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Subsequently, critics such as T. E. Blom, Barbara Everett, and Susan Hegeman have attempted to locate <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> within conventional paradigms of modernism.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Loos’s “Blonde book,” as Faulkner called it, has proven tricky to categorize. As Faye Hammill points out, “the primary difference between the admiring and the critical readers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span> is that the former consider Loos as an ironic and perceptive commentator on mass culture and the latter see her as an emanation from that culture and a producer of its commodities.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Hammill proposes that middlebrow is a useful term to describe Loos’s work, which responds parodically to both modernist and mass culture. Rather than perpetuating the battle of the brows, however, I will suggest here that the significance of Loos’s work lies not in its adherence to existing literary paradigms or in generating a synthetic third category of cultural classification, but rather in its more specific project of creating distinct forms of vernacular modernism. <a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

      Lorelei’s blonde “ambishion” of intertwining literature and cinema reflects Loos’s participation in one of the most radical aesthetic projects of early twentieth-century art from within popular culture. Loos herself was a star “authoress” of cinema, having written numerous one- and two-reelers, along with features for Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith, two pillars of American filmmaking, and screenplays such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Red-Headed Woman</span>  and the adaptation of Clare Booth Luce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Women</span> . There has been a recent resurgence of interest in Loos, signaled by a series of trenchant articles on <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> and by <span style="font-style:italic;">Anita Loos Rediscovered</span>, which presents a selection of her extensive cinema writing; however, Loos’s contributions to cinema and literary histories have not been formally connected.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> During the silent era, Loos was widely known as one of the most innovative writers of titles (variously called intertitles, subtitles, or leaders).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      Film historians have presented the main story of early cinema as the controversy about the coming of sound, but there was also a passionate debate about titling, and Loos was an important part of this. Challenging the separation of literature and cinema as high and low culture, Loos develops a mode of writing in which literature and cinema together unmoor the conventional relationship of the image to the word. Taken together, Loos’s titles and <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> show a cross-genre relationship of exchange that has the effect of reconceiving language and image in a new way. Her novel borrows visual properties from film, and her films borrow textual strategies from literature. Both appropriations show how words exceed their contexts and signify not only through their meaning but also through their literal status as objects: letters printed on the page or projected on the screen. At a transitional moment when literary institutions were changing and the cinema was being born, Loos cross-pollinates the novel with the cinema to invent new forms of vernacular pleasure: the literary cinema, and the cinematic novel.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Horrors of Modern Pleasure</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> appeared at a time when readers were highly invested in the exercise of cultural distinction and, in particular, distinctions about pleasure. The novel—like all of Loos’s writing—draws much of its comedy from this discourse in which certain (feminine, bodily, visual, sensual, collective: “blonde”) pleasures are constructed as culturally corrosive and others (cerebral, individualized, written) are favored as edifying and worthwhile. Of course, this recapitulates what Andreas Huyssen calls “one of the most tired topoi of the modernist aesthetic and of bourgeois culture at large: there are the lower pleasures for the rabble, i.e., mass culture, and then there is the <span style="font-style:italic;">nouvelle cuisine</span> of the pleasure of the text, of <span style="font-style:italic;">jouissance</span>.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Tired, yes, but tenacious. From descriptions of the consumption of popular culture as a drug habit to the Frankfurt School critiques of “distraction factories” (“Fun is a medicinal bath,” Adorno grumbles),<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> from Eliot to Greenberg, distinctions about pleasure undergird classic articulations of cultural hierarchy.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Yet to conclude, as Lionel Trilling does, in a 1963 essay called “The Fate of Pleasure,” that the modernist desire to destroy “the habits, manners, and ‘values’ of the bourgeois world” results in a fundamental “repudiation of pleasure,” is too simple.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Loos, for whom both kinds of pleasure are compelling, slyly demonstrates how acts of cultural classification (and their undoing) are themselves pleasurable.
      </p>
<p>
	Leavis’s, Lewis’s, and Connolly’s readings of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> prove that conservative critics can be tone deaf to the charms of mass culture but also attuned to its fundamental elements. Leavis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiction and the Reading Public</span>  designates <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> as representative of popular fiction published in 1925, asserting that the novel’s “slick technique is the product of centuries of journalistic experience and whose effect depends entirely on the existence of a set of stock responses provided by newspaper and film.” The correlation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> and cinema, intended as a slight, is an acute observation. However, Leavis’s conception of mass culture—“crude and puerile,” “made up of phrases and clichés that imply fixed, or rather stereotyped, habits of thinking and feeling”—is willfully reductive: she could only wish that the attractions of mass culture were so nugatory. Leavis’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contrast between the pleasures of popular culture—bodily, auditory (music, voice) or visual (cinema)—and those of high culture—cerebral and textual (“the free play of ironical intelligence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage to India</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>”)—is the very paradigm around which Loos shapes <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Leavis seems amazingly (conveniently?) unaware of the fact that Loos both indulges in and satirizes idioms of mass culture.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Like Leavis, Wyndham Lewis describes Loos’s language as distinctively colloquial and verbal (spoken and heard rather than written) in his perverse yet inspired pairing of Loos and Gertrude Stein in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span>, in which he calls <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> “the breathless babble of the wide-eyed child.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> (In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Long Week End</span>, Graves and Hodge also highlight the “artless pseudo-baby language” of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>) Lewis joins Leavis in emphasizing Loos’s affiliation with cinema, dubbing her, together with Charlie Chaplin, “revolutionary simpletons.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Continuing this taxonomy of body and cinema versus mind and text, Cyril Connolly’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Enemies of Promise</span>  places <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> in the category of “Vernacular,” as opposed to “Mandarin” literature (for example, Eliot’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>). Hemingway is “the outstanding writer of the new vernacular”; he writes in “a style in which the body talks rather than the mind, one admirable for rendering emotions; love, fear, joy of battle, despair, sexual appetite, but impoverished for intellectual purposes.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	For all these critics, the distinctions between low and high, popular and elite, image and word, cinema and literature, are functions of the quality of <span style="font-style:italic;">pleasure</span> produced. Leavis praises the “cumulative pleasures” of Puritan reading habits, and the “extremely subtle kind of pleasure” valued by the eighteenth-century reading public “prepared to take some trouble for its pleasures,” as opposed to the “immediate,” “cheap and easy pleasures offered by the cinema, the circulating library, the magazine, the newspaper, the dance-hall, and the loud-speaker.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> One of the most explicit articulations of this formulation is Aldous Huxley’s 1923 essay “Pleasures,” in which he contrasts “old pleasures demanding intelligence” to “the horrors of modern ‘pleasure’”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  “Pleasure” (I place the word between inverted commas to show that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized activities officially known by the same name) “pleasure”—what nightmare visions the word evokes! . . . . To the interminable democracies of the world a million cinemas bring the same balderdash. . . . Countless audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of them, no participation; they need only sit and keep their eyes open.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	These polarized classifications of pleasure, in which cinema is inevitably the placeholder for cultural degeneration, are often so strict as to be farcical, and seem almost to beg to have their terms tousled, as was the case with Huxley, who loved <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> and wrote to Loos in 1945 about how he was planning a film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Brave New World</span> that would “revolve around the person of a very clever but physically unattractive scientist, desperately trying to make a gorgeous blonde” suspiciously like Lorelei.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Loos, such ideological inconsistency, whereby those who claim to be most invested in cultural distinction are receptive to the voluptuous allure of denigrated pleasures, is a springboard to satire. Loos cannily named Lorelei after a mythological German  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Rhine Maiden, a Siren, that re around whom Horkheimer and Adorno shape their Enlightenment dichotomies (modernism versus mass culture, mind versus body, bourgeois intellectual versus proletarian laborer, and “‘masculine’ rationalization” versus “‘feminine’ pleasure”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a>). Many intellectuals, lashed to the mast of cultural distinction, savored the giddy pleasures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>. (It is a happy coincidence that, at least according to Heine, the Teutonic Lorelei was, like Loos’s siren, also a blonde.)
      </p>
<p>
	In a context in which approved pleasures are deliberate, complex, and cerebral, Loos’s novel is strategically lightweight. When Lorelei is traveling through “the central of Europe” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 75), she goes to Vienna and sees the great doctor himself for psychoanalysis. “Dr. Froyd” marvels at the fact that Lorelei has no inhibitions and does not seem to dream at night. She explains, “I mean I use my brains so much in the day time that at night they do not seem to do anything else but rest.” She appears to have no capacity for conflict, sublimation, interiority, guilt, self-consciousness, or depth: in short, none of the interests of intellectual modernity. Lorelei recalls that Freud “seemed very very intreeged at a girl who always seemed to do everything she wanted to do” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 90). Loos gives Lorelei virtually all of the fearsomely pleasurable characteristics of mass culture: female, seductive, ravenously materialistic, American, and cinematic.
      </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> looks quite different if, instead of reading it as symptomatic of the degraded idiom of cinema, we see it as based on historically specific cinematic effects. The novel is framed by Lorelei’s film career: when it opens, she has retired, and her triumphant return to the movies closes the book. In between, she flits among some of Hollywood’s major names, meeting “Mr. Chaplin once when we were both working on the same lot in Hollywood” and lunching with “Eddie Goldmark of the Goldmark Films,” based on the film mogul producer Samuel Goldwyn (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 6, 16). More fundamentally, the language of the novel and its visual qualities are drawn from the distinctive voice Loos developed ten years earlier within silent film.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Handwriting on the Screen</h1>
<p>
	The story of literary modernity includes mass-produced texts such as newspapers and magazines, billboards, and other forms of advertising that inspired, for example, the skywriting in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, and the skittering Hely’s sandwich-board men in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. However, the huge words that silent cinema routinely cast in front of audiences are rarely a part of this historical narrative. Titles were introduced into silent film as the functional heirs of the nickelodeon projectionist who read out information to the audience. In early Edison films, titles were explanatory devices that patched over gaps in the narrative; in the early 1910s, they started to include direct dialogue.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> For the most part, titles were perfunctory, establishing only basic narrative facts; most filmmakers and critics regarded them as a crude but necessary tool indicating the technological limitations of silent film. In his influential <span style="font-style:italic;">Photoplay: A Psychological Study</span> , Hugo Münsterberg opines that intertitles should be regarded as “extraneous to the original character of the photoplay;” they are “accessory, while the primary power must lie in the content of the pictures themselves.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Manuals for aspiring photoplay  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> writers published in the 1910s insisted that “the use of a leader [title] is in most cases a frank confession that you are incapable of ‘putting over’ a point in the development of your plot solely by the action in the scenes—you must call in outside assistance, as it were.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The vigorous discussion about titling in film magazines and newspapers in the 1910s and early 1920s, Laura Marcus observes, raised “fundamental questions about the nature of film language and, indeed, the extent to which cinematic images could be understood as elements of a language.” Captions and intertitles were understood as an “intrusion of the literary into what should be an essentially pictorial realm.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> They were not, in the early 1910s, considered an artistic form for individual authorship, but were anonymous and banal placeholders. Loos changed this.
      </p>
<p>
	Loos’s debut in cinema was precocious and auspicious. D. W. Griffith bought one of her first scenarios, which became a 1912 one-reeler, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Hat</span>, starring Mary Pickford and Lionel Barrymore. Her early scenarios were fairly conventional, but she was already experimenting with the concept of words not just as representations of ideas but also as objects with their own material status. Loos’s 1914 one-reeler <span style="font-style:italic;">The School of Acting</span> features Professor Bunk’s drama school in which thespians are taught to emote according to “large cards, about two feet square, [on which Bunk] has printed in big type the names of the different emotions”: “Anger,” “Jealousy,” etc. Comedy ensues when actors are shown the cards in inappropriate circumstances and cannot help but act them out. The cards suggest titles, which cinema audiences read in tandem with the actors in the film, causing a metatextual collapse of viewer/actor and word/image. In “By Way of France,” a young French woman is kidnapped upon her arrival in New York; she manages to drop a note pleading “au secours! au secours!” but efforts to save her are thwarted because the man who finds the note cannot read French. Finally he finds a French dictionary and rescues her; they exchange a note: “Je t’aime.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Both films revolve around texts as concrete images—as material combinations of letters—and the complications caused by faulty readings of words. The titles do not just elucidate the plot but are themselves the plot. Both films express anxiety about literacy and cinema audiences’ ability or willingness to extend their attention to reading.
      </p>
<p>
	In the mid 1910s, Loos’s future husband, John Emerson, pitched some of Loos’s screenplays to Griffith, who pointed out that they did not follow the usual protocol: “most of the laughs are in the dialogue which can’t be photographed,” he said, and “people don’t go to the movies to read.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Nevertheless, in 1916, Loos displayed her idiosyncratic style of titling in her first of many screenplays for Douglas Fairbanks, <span style="font-style:italic;">His Picture in the Papers</span>. Loos led with a lengthy text: “Publicity at any price has become the predominant passion of the American people. May we beg leave to introduce you to a shining disciple of this modern art of ‘three-sheeting,’ Proteus Prindle, producer of Prindle’s 27 Vegetarian Varieties.” Parodying the Heinz Corporation with its “57 varieties” and the current fad for vegetarianism, Loos addresses her readers sarcastically (“a shining disciple of this modern art”) and peppers her sentences with alliteration, mixing precious locutions (“May we beg leave to introduce you”) with slang (“three sheeting”). A saucy title announces a scene in which Pete Prindle, the carnivorous son of Proteus Prindle (and brother of “PEARL AND PANSY . . . KNOWN AS “28” AND  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “29”), kisses his girlfriend, who has previously received a “hygienic kiss” from a vegetarian: “Wherein it is shown that beefsteak produces a different style of love-making from prunes.” Late in the story, a title comments about Pete: “Ain’t he the REEL hero?” This punning voice establishes an autonomous level of commentary that self-consciously gestures at the film’s REEL medium and the title’s REAL textuality.
      </p>
<p>
	The film was considered a milestone in titling and Loos received widespread attention in industry and general interest publications. Louella Parsons declared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Telegraph</span> that Loos had “revolutionized” titling.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Fairbanks signed an exclusive contract with Loos in 1916 to write the titles for all his films. In an article for <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Magazine</span> called “The Handwriting on the Screen,” Fairbanks told Karl Schmidt that “Time and time again . . . I have sat through plays with Miss Loos and have heard the audience applaud her subtitles as heartily as the lively scenes.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Even an anti-titling critic such as Vachel Lindsay, who bemoaned that “‘Title writing’ remains a commercial necessity,” conceded that “in this field there is but one person who has won distinction—Anita Loos,” who was as “brainy” as anyone could be “and still remain in the department store film business.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Loos saw titling as a locus of linguistic creativity and authorial power in film. “Titling pictures had all the fascination of doing crossword puzzles but was a lot more fun,” she remarked (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 103). Loos’s titles, which film historian Kristin Thompson calls “the Loos-style title,” or the “‘literary’ inter-title,” instigated the recognizable shift to witty and prolix titles in films of the late 1910s.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Fundamentally changing the concept of cinematic pleasure as passive vision (“they need only sit and keep their eyes open”), Loos’s titles presumed and even created an active audience to whom they offered a new kind of pleasure: <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> visual pleasure. Loos did not just coax people to read; she taught them to view words as images. <span style="font-style:italic;">American Aristocracy</span> , another Fairbanks film, is an exemplary “Loos-style” script. The opening title asks,
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Has America an aristocracy? We say yes! And to prove it we take you to Newport-bythe- Sea, where we find some of our finest families whose patents of nobility are founded on such deeds of daring as the canning of soup, the floating of soap and the borating of talcum.
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Satirizing the insular Newport colony, where capitalism produces its own aristocracy (“patents of nobility”), the film’s titles include puns, euphemisms, mock Latin, and other fairly intricate jokes, along with written documents—letters, newspapers, ads—that were commonly used in films at the time. But while the interpolated documents are incorporated into the plot in the conventional way (in other words, the audience reads them as the characters read them), the intertitles are often detached from the plot, either commenting upon it or embarking on an entirely new conversation. Thompson refers to this aspect of Loos’s titles as “double functioning,” in which “almost every expository title that begins a scene also makes a verbal joke of its own”—a style quickly taken up by other comic writers, including Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The hero of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Aristocracy</span>, played by Fairbanks, is introduced by a title:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  Now, Narraport Aristocracy possesses no interest for Cassius Lee of Virginia, amateur entomologist,* who has arrived in these parts on the trail of the migratory caterpillar.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  *Entomologist—High-brow term for bug hunter
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The footnote creates a level of diegesis two times removed from the cinematic plot (film diegesis: intertitle: footnote to intertitle). Moreover, the footnote splits the author’s voice between one that uses a “high-brow” term (and a fancy flourish like a footnote) and another that undermines this pretension. Loos never missed an opportunity to set high and low against one another.
	</p>
<p>
	  In “The Handwriting on the Wall,” Loos told <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Magazine</span> that her “most popular subtitle introduced the name of a new character. . . . The name was something like this: ‘Count Xxerkzsxxv.’ Then there was a note, ‘To those of you who read titles aloud, you can’t pronounce the Count’s name. You can only think it.’”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> The title, as described by Loos, establishes a direct relationship between the audience and the writer that entirely excludes the film. It insists that this jumble of letters cannot be treated as an oral artifact. Language here is neither visual nor audible but rather located in an abstract realm of thought. Words don’t just represent ideas: they are ideas in themselves. The fact that Loos considered this title—explicitly exclusionary, self-reflexive, and suggestively high modernist in tone—her “most popular” suggests how differently she imagined her audience from most critics of the time. Loos’s cinema offered the pleasures of interpretation and irony—those “mandarin,” “subtle,” and “intelligent” pleasures that Leavis, Connolly, Huxley, and others claimed were the purview of literature. Loos assumes that audiences could <span style="font-style:italic;">enjoy</span> the collision of different levels of cultural pleasure.
	</p>
<p>
	  This was the single historical moment when film could be so clearly exploited for literary purposes, and Loos did just that. She did it by flouting current theories that film should strive to be a purely visual form, and the idea of cinema as a seamless illusion with invisible techniques. Ignoring the injunction of critics such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Dramatic Mirror</span>’s Frank Woods that, “We the spectators are not part of the picture, nor is there supposed to be a camera there making a moving photograph of the scene,”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Loos’s titles directly addressed the spectator, the cinematic equivalent of breaking the fourth wall. Against the idea of film functioning like hieroglyphics (promulgated by Vachel Lindsay) or as a universal language healing the linguistic fragmentation of the Tower of Babel (associated with Griffith), Loos crafted a highly idiomatic cinema that cultivated tension, rather than harmony, between text and image. In both her cinema writing and subsequently in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, Loos employs a number of techniques to promote this pleasurable friction between word and image: visual and graphic subordination (subtitles, captions, footnotes), punning, homophones, phonetic spelling, a split voice, and a kind of artistic synesthesia (asking audiences to read images and see words).
	</p>
<p>
	  Loos’s 1919 short story “The Moving Pictures of Blinkville” dramatizes the process by which the pleasures of the text compete with the pleasures of the image. A trickster pretends to be a filmmaker. After the town’s denizens pose for his camera, he takes an old parade film and transforms it “by long and labored work at scratching and clouding  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the film,” like a form of writing. The resulting movie “projected on the curtain was not a picture—it was a series of blurs and blotches.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> He shows it to great acclaim as “Scenes of Blinkville.” The word, which is supposed to be subordinate to the visual spectacle, is rendered concrete and assumes a starring role. Audiences, without realizing it, are induced to “read” a film.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  At no other time in cinema history did the word exert so much power. Loos continued to capitalize on the battle between the image and the word, and the related disputes about hierarchies of cultural pleasure in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>. One film project was unexpectedly influential for Loos and for <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes: Intolerance</span>.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“A bathtub full of diamonds”: <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>
</h1>
<p>
	  While Fairbanks’s films represent classic Hollywood cinema, Griffith was a re caught between convention and innovation, pulling back toward the theater and forward toward cinema’s future with innovative techniques that inspired experimental filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, and that have led more recent critics to view Griffith as an early modernist.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Loos was invited to collaborate with Griffith and Frank Woods on the titles of <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> . The film, approximately three hours long, presents a sweeping metanarrative, the “history of how hatred and intolerance, through all the ages, have battled against love and charity.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> has a fugue-like structure that uses parallel montage to intercut among four narratives set in different eras (Babylonian, Biblical, seventeenth-century France, and Modern Day). Each narrative features characters (many of whom are given generic titles such as “The Dear One,” The Boy,” and “The Friendless One”) who act out analogous scenarios of oppression or “intolerance.” In the Babylonian narrative, one priest violently represses a more hedonistic sect; in the Biblical narrative, Jesus is martyred; in the French narrative, Huguenots are slaughtered on St. Bartholomew’s Day; and in the Modern Day story, a workers’ strike is violently suppressed and a self-righteous group of female reformers destroy a family.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Loos claims that she was “the first viewer ever to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> [in the editing room]. I must be honest and say I thought D.W. had lost his mind . . . In that era of the simple, straightforward technique for telling picture plots, Griffith had crashed slambang into a method for which neither I nor, as was subsequently proved, his audiences had been prepared” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 102). The dominant models of spectatorship—as intoxication or passive escape—fail to account for <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>, which requires its audiences to synthesize four widely disparate historical narratives and to relate allegorical images (the Book of Intolerance, the woman—Lillian Gish—rocking the cradle) to the stories around them. <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> calls upon its audience to construct its meaning, but it gives assistance through didactic titles, beginning with a sequence that addresses the viewer and explains how to watch the film—“you will find our play turning from one of the four stories to another, as the common theme unfolds in each”—and marking many of the bridges between the film’s different time frames. The titles are remarkably variable in their style and tone, reflecting, no doubt, the three different authors who worked  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on them. Many titles are bombastic and heavy-handed, for example: “My Lord, like white pearls I shall keep my tears in an ark of silver for your return. I bite my thumb! I strike my girdle! If you return not, I go to the death halls of Allat”.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In most cases, we can only speculate which writer was responsible for which title, but the stylistic differences are suggestive. Loos was clear about her role. In her memoir, she recalls, “D. W. bade me put in titles even when unnecessary and add laughs wherever I found an opening. I found several” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 103). Interspersed among the instructive and weighty inscriptions are lighter and more ironic captions that seem more reflective of the “Loos-style.” For example, in the scene in which The Dear One, who has jealously watched a woman’s undulating walk draw men’s attention on the street and decides to imitate her by tying her skirt into a hobble, a title dryly comments that “The new walk seems to bring results” as men flock to her ridiculous gait. In the marriage market in Babylon, when no one bids on the feisty Mountain Girl, she shouts at them, “You lice! You rats! You refuse me? There is no gentler dove in all Babylon than I.”
	</p>
<p>
	  Some titles are more subtle, as when the repressive High Priest of Bel-Marduk is threatened by the rival cult of Ishtar. The title remarks, “He angrily resolves to reestablish his own god—incidentally himself.” The final modifier sarcastically comments from outside the action in a distinctly contemporary idiom. The tone does not match the image, and the title elicits a snicker where the image is aiming for sober drama. Later in the film, in the Modern narrative, when The Boy is framed and put in jail, the title remarks, “Stolen goods, planted on the Boy, and his bad reputation, intolerate him away for a term.” The verb form “intolerate” can be read as a teasing poke at Griffith’s tendentious insistence upon the word and the concept of intolerance, which often seems like an elaborate defense against criticism of his race politics in <span style="font-style:italic;">Birth of a Nation</span>.
	</p>
<p>
	  Griffith shared with Loos an interest in making films more porous to high culture, as reflected by his use of Whitman and other literary and artistic intertexts. However, while Griffith used this material in a fairly traditional style, as epigraph or thematic support, Loos’s literary intertexts are usually cheeky. The one title for which Loos routinely claimed credit—and also the most controversial title in <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>—is such a text. She recalls, “At one point I paraphrased Voltaire in a manner which particularly pleased D. W.: ‘When women cease to attract men, they often turn to reform as second choice’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 103). While it may seem odd that Loos would claim authorship for a quotation that is arguably misogynist, she never hesitated to distance herself from feminism. Loos’s idea of female empowerment is more <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex and the Single Girl</span> than suffragette, and she was always at pains to emphasize her girlishness and insignificance even as she, like her titles, stole the spotlight. (Writing about how <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> had been inspired by Mencken’s barbs aimed at his fellow Americans, she remarks that “My book was certainly an offshoot of Mencken’s point of view, just as a gadget can be produced by the important theory of a scientist” [<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 217].) Loos flaunted superficial signifiers of cultural capital in her intertitles, not so much to make films “smarter” but to disrupt the expected relationship between the image and the word, vacuous mass culture and clever high culture. The epic complexity of <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>—its heterogeneity, didacticism and suggestion, melodrama and innovation—challenged Loos to be unusually resourceful  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and produce a subtle, insinuating voice for a film that defied current cinematic conventions and concepts of cinematic pleasure.
	</p>
<p>
	  Vachel Lindsay writes, “Anita Loos once said to me that <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> was ‘a bathtub full of diamonds’. . . . It was a humorous way of proclaiming that there were enough suggestions in <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>, to producers of imagination, to last the motion picture world for fifty years.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> This is certainly the case, but here Loos speaks, significantly, in the dialect of Lorelei: “kissing your hand may make you feel very very good but a diamond and safire bracelet lasts forever” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 55). Loos explicitly connects <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> to the world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> by giving Lorelei a cameo in the film. “I was doing quite well in the cinema when Mr Eisman made me give it all up,” Lorelei remarks at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 6). Her “last cinema,” was <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>, in which she played “one of the girls that fainted at the battle when all of the gentlemen fell off the tower” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 8). The battle in question is the fall of Babylon, which indicates Lorelei’s definition of “gentlemen” (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). Lorelei’s appearance in the film is preposterous but also has a particular logic to it.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As Miriam Hansen notices, one of <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>’s dominant themes is the dramatic “fate—and fatal power—of unmarried female characters throughout the ages” and how their environment thwarts or supports them; Michael Rogin adds that many of the narrative threads in the film promote female sexuality and public pleasure.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Babylonian narrative in which Lorelei acts features open eroticism, feasting, and elaborate dance sequences (according to accounts from the set of <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>, some of the extras hired to appear semi-nude in the scenes were, as Lorelei would say, “not nice”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a>). <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span> sympathizes with women of pleasure who are the victims of intolerance: the temple prostitutes/“Virgins” in Mesopotamia, Mary Magdalen, and the women who are herded out of the bordello under the gleeful eyes of the Modern Day reformists (the subjects of Loos’s “female reformers” title). Both Griffith and Loos were fascinated by hypocritical reformers. Henry Spoffard, who becomes Lorelei’s husband, is a wealthy cinema “senshure” who likes to assemble the “riskay” scenes he has excised into a movie that he watches recreationally with other men, like a reformist stag film (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 103). At one point in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, Spoffard tells Lorelei that she “seemed to remind him quite a lot of a girl who got quite a write-up in the bible who was called Magdellen. So then he said that he used to be a member of the choir himself, so who was he to cast the first rock at a girl like I” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 93).
	</p>
<p>
	  Loos leads her reader to infer a somewhat seamy quid pro quo underpinning the economics of Lorelei’s glamorous life, but critics are divided about exactly what goes on. Barbara Everett describes Lorelei as “a cherubic-faced nail-hard amateur whore” ; Regina Barecca remarks that Lorelei and Dorothy are “closer to con artists than to whores . . . far from professional courtesans” (xvii); Katharina von Ankum states that Lorelei “preserves her virginity” until she marries Spoffard.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> All these readings are technically plausible. “Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure” is as euphemistically apt a subtitle for <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> as “The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady,” which Loos, always taking advantage of structural subordination, subtitled her novel. What is certain is that Lorelei, like the profession to which she gravitates, the cinema, is in the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> business of selling pleasure. Loos went on to exploit <span style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span>’s linguistic subtleties and thematics of pleasure in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, where she plays Griffith’s vast historical epic as local comedy.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gentlemen Prefer Typists</h1>
<p>
	  According to Lorelei, she has “been” three careers. Back when she was still going by her given name, Mabel Minnow, her father sent her to “the business colledge” in Little Rock, but after just a week, a lawyer named Mr. Jennings hired her to be his new stenographer. She reports that she “stayed in his office about a year,” doing exactly what, she does not say. Lorelei’s first job links her to one of modernity’s favorite female icons, the secretary or typewriter girl,<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> who embodies the paradoxes of female pleasure and technologies of writing in ways that anticipate the cinema spectatrix and the cinema writer. On the one hand, the stenographer/typist/secretary earns money and works in the public sphere. On the other hand, hers is a labor of automatism, Marx’s “dead labor,” regurgitating the words of others. She is connected to writing, but only in the passive sense of recording or transposing someone else’s (usually her male boss’s) thoughts. Her job is copying, transposing, correcting errors, and rendering her work transparent;  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> she has no distinctive authorial signature. She bears a remarkable resemblance to the cinema titler before Loos transformed that role.
	</p>
<p>
	  The typist’s primary identity is as a worker, but there is, as Christopher Keep notes, an “excessive, almost obsessional fascination . . . with the assumed promiscuity of the female typist.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> As Lawrence Rainey remarks, “The typist, after all, is repetition personified,” but she is also imagined as “represen[ting] the promise of modern freedom: an allegedly new, autonomous subject whose appetites for pleasure and sensuous fulfillment were legitimated by modernity itself.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Eliot’s robotic typist in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, for whom sex is anhedonic, combines these features: “Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.” The typist’s sexuality is imagined as analogous to her production of language (anonymous, automatic). Loos wrote several secretarial screenplays exploring the misreadings accruing around this amanuensis of alienated words. Erik von Stroheim’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Social Secretary</span>  follows a stenographer who loses several jobs because she is harassed by her male employers, including a boss at the office of the New York Purity League who looks at “riskay” pictures—a forerunner of Henry Spoffard. <span style="font-style:italic;">Virtuous Vamp</span>  also features a talented stenographer who is fired because she distracts the men around her from their work. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Red-Headed Woman</span>, Jean Harlow plays the stenographer as a “sex pirate” (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 42). By giving Lorelei a brief past as a stenographer, Loos invokes all the narrative clichés associating debased writing and pleasure that surround this handmaiden of modern literature. Even more significantly, it is through this so-called career that Lorelei is “discovered.”
	</p>
<p>
	  Lorelei’s stenography stint comes to an end when she catches Mr. Jennings with “a girl . . . who really was famous all over Little Rock for not being nice” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 24–25). Lorelei recalls that when she “found out that girls like that paid calls on Mr. Jennings I had quite a bad case of histerics and my mind was really a blank and when I came out of it, it seems that I had a revolver in my hand and it seems that the revolver had shot Mr Jennings” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 25). Lorelei’s revolver is part Hedda Gabler, part Mae West, but it is recast as an instrument that conveniently—like the typewriter—erases her agency. During her murder trial, Mabel Minnow seduces the jury with her damsel in distress routine and is acquitted. The judge, who appreciates her act, bestows upon her a ticket to Hollywood and the stage name Lorelei Lee. “It was when Mr. Jennings became shot,” she remarks, “that I got the idea to go into the cinema” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 25). Never has the passive tense been deployed so tactically.
	</p>
<p>
	  In making stenography the gateway to the cinema, Loos cannily invokes the popular discourse of the 1920s that associates the typewriter girl with cinema.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> A classic formulation is Kracauer’s 1927 series of vignettes “The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies,” which asserts that “Sensational film hits and life usually correspond to each other because the Little Miss Typists model themselves after the examples they see on the screen.”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Iris Barry argues that one of cinema’s key consumers is “The typist in search of a thrill.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> The typist and the spectatrix seem to support one another; as Freidrich A. Kittler puts it, “at night [women] are at the movies and during the day they sit at their typewriters.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  The typewriter and the cinema are connected materially (both are American, individuality-flattening technologies that traffic in copies) as well as imaginatively.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Both are understood as feminized and offering paradoxical pleasures. Early film critics describe cinema going as an experience of fantasy and escape, but they also imagine cinematic pleasure as banal and standardized. (“That which determines the rhythm of production on a conveyer belt is the basis of the rhythm of reception in the film,” Walter Benjamin remarks in “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire.”<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a>) Even Iris Barry, one of early cinema’s greatest advocates, describes the “experience derived from the pictures” as “second-hand,” and “imitation excitement,” “almost as standardized as a church service or a daily newspaper”; “I wish that the public could, in the midst of its pleasures, ask for slightly better dreams.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Cinematic pleasure is understood as a kind of false consciousness.
	</p>
<p>
	  Loos turns to the typewriter girl to constellate—and also recast—the connection between mechanized writing, debased pleasure, and cinema writing. Lorelei, we can safely assume, is not much of a typist: she writes her diary in longhand, and not very well at that. And Lorelei is not a spectatrix, but a would-be actress. The cinema turns out to be the closest thing to a true profession to her. In making cinema a place of production rather than consumption, Loos alters the standard trope of passive celluloid just as her trademark cinematic style diverges from the paradigm of hypnotic spectatorship. The titler herself is historically positioned like the typist, alienated from her labor: Loos alters that by reinventing the form.
	</p>
<p>
	  Loos fashioned not just Lorelei but also herself through the typist/cinema correlation. In her memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">A Girl Like I</span>, a phrase taken from Lorelei (Loos often slips into such Loreleisms, as she does in her essays as well), Loos chose to reproduce a Ralph Barton sketch of herself, a well-known cinema writer, as a cutely infantile typewriter girl (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). Antonia Lant suggests that the proliferation of publicity shots of female cinema writers in the 1920s shown at their typewriters was a way of solving the “awkwardness in efforts to signify women’s acts of film writing, given the cultural desire to make her an object of visual study.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Loos uses the standard shot to render writing visual in a much more complicated way, adding a caption to the image in which she adopts the voice of Lorelei: “The only thing wrong with this picture is that an authoress like I never learned to type” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, unnumbered insert between 150 and 151). As in her cinema titles, texts that are supposed to be subordinate to and explain the image but instead upstage it, this caption undermines the image while purporting to support it. Ostensibly revealing Loos’s shortcomings, it in fact makes her superior to the typist. The sentence reflects the anxiety that cinema titling is regarded like typewriting: debased, anonymous, and subordinate, an inartistic stream of banal formulas rather than the individualized, scripted work of a legitimate writer.
	</p>
<p>
	  On the same page of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Girl Like I</span>, below Barton’s drawing, is a photograph of Loos sitting at a desk with a pen in her hand, a seemingly straightforward portrait of the artist at work. Yet Loos adds this caption: “My sole preparation for a career was to buy a fountain pen and a large yellow pad: no dictionary or grammar required. Some day I’ll give a course on ‘how to succeed in literature without any learning.’” This idea of producing literature without learning is as disingenuous as the usage of the words “education” and “literary” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>. While Lorelei inflates these words and her own  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “literary” labor, Loos deflates them. Loos implicates these two means of writing—the typewriter and the caption (analogous to the subtitle as a text linked to an image)—to position herself between low and high cultural pursuits.

<p>
	  In her film writing, Loos routinely disrupts visual pleasure and puts in its place the pleasure of the text. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, she follows the same principles, but because of her medium, the effect is slightly different. Her cinematic language creates literary visual pleasure and her novelistic language creates visual literary pleasure. Lorelei, acting as authoress in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, writes in a language that induces the reader to see words as images.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“Transparent negligays and ornamental bath tubs”</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> is a visual novel in several senses. Most obviously, it is illustrated by Ralph Barton, who was under contract with <span style="font-style:italic;">Harper’s Bazar: A Repository of Fashion, Pleasure and Instruction</span> (it became <span style="font-style:italic;">Harper’s Bazaar</span> in 1929), where <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> first appeared in serialized form. Loos was not responsible for the images, but they are routinely included in editions of the novel, so they have become part of its textual apparatus. As it happens, they reflect Loos’s preoccupation with technologies of writing. The first illustration shows Lorelei at her desk with a pen, writing in her diary: exactly the same pose as Loos’s publicity photo. The humorous caption Loos appended to her own portrait is perfectly appropriate for this occasion: Lorelei has “succeeded in literature  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> without any learning.” Barton’s second illustration shows Lorelei on a couch with a stack of books scattered around her, looking perplexed. When a “literary” admirer (a novelist) gives Lorelei several Conrad novels in an effort to “educate” her, she asks her maid to read and summarize them; she comes to the conclusion that they are “all about ocean travel” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 8). Lorelei is only marginally literate, but her mistakes have the effect of calling attention to her writing with comments such as, “I have just noticed that I have written clear across two pages onto March 18<sup>th</sup>, so this will do for today and tomorrow” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 5).
	</p>
<p>
	  Lorelei’s voice is reminiscent of other unreliable narrators—John Dowell, Nick Carraway, or Molly Bloom—but Loos adds a linguistic layer of textual play through Lorelei’s misspellings and malapropisms. Even as Loos constantly signals toward the textual production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> through these mistakes, critics such as Leavis, Lewis, and Connolly take Lorelei literally (“But writing is different because you do not have to learn or practice”) and understand her voice as just that, a literal voice—oral, idiomatic, and “artless pseudo-baby language.” They focus on the verbal qualities of Lorelei’s narrative and perceive it as “uncrafted” bodily speech rather than scripted language. Lorelei’s phonetic spelling and punctuation errors, along with Loos’s innuendos, euphemisms, and double entendres, do lend themselves to this reading—for example, Lorelei’s explanation that “of course when a gentleman is interested in educating a girl, he likes to stay and talk about the topics of the day until quite late,” or Dorothy’s suspicions about a girl in Paris who claims to be eighteen: “how could a girl get such dirty knees in only 18 years?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 4, 66). However, most of the humor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> depends upon visual word play.
	</p>
<p>
	  Lorelei’s trip to Europe affords Loos an opportunity to make multilingual puns (for example, Lorelei’s adventure with the French con artists “Louie and Robber,” her visit to “Fountainblo” and “Momart” [<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 62]). Lorelei remarks that “French is really very easy, for instance the French use the word ‘sheik’ for everything, while we only seem to use it for gentlemen when they seem to resemble Rudolf Valentino” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 69). Loos frequently crafts homophone puns such as Sheik/chic or Hofbraü/half brow (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 86), which, while based on words sounding alike, have to be seen to be perceived (as the “real/reel” pun in <span style="font-style:italic;">His Picture in the Papers</span>). As with the cinema title about the unpronounceable Count—which looks like a vengeful secretary has pounded on random keys—Loos’s language in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> highlights the details of its construction.
	</p>
<p>
	  Faulkner’s 1925 letter to Loos illustrates the many levels of voice and awareness in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Please accept my envious congratulations on Dorothy—the way you did her through the intelligence of that elegant moron of a cornflower. Only you have played a rotten trick on your admiring public. How many of them, do you think, will ever know that Dorothy really has something . . . My God, it’s charming . . . most of them will be completely unmoved—even your rather clumsy gags won’t get them—and the others will only find it slight and humorous. The Andersons [Sherwood and Elizabeth] even mentioned Ring Lardner in talking to me about it. But perhaps that was what you were after, and you have builded better than you knew. . . .<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  It is no wonder that Faulkner prefers Dorothy, Lorelei’s brunette sidekick who is the voice of overt irony, modernism’s signature rhetoric, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>. Faulkner divides the readers of Loos’s novel into those aligned with Lorelei (the “admiring public”) and those aligned with Dorothy (educated readers). Faulkner is not so sure where Loos herself falls. Mentioning Lardner, the acknowledged master of modern American vernacular, Faulkner then revokes the compliment by suggesting that the effect was not deliberate, but also jokes back at Loos by imitating Lorelei: “you have builded better than you knew.” Faulkner assumes two separate and hierarchical audiences who experience two different reading effects (irony versus mere humor), two different levels of comprehension, and hence two different kinds of pleasure. Faulkner does not acknowledge the ways in which Lorelei (who is hardly “elegant”), as scripted by Loos, is an only half proficient writer but a master of strategy. Lorelei’s voice is, in fact, more complex than Dorothy’s sophisticated but straightforward irony. Her grasp of language is comical, but she is nevertheless skilled in dissimulation. She is a surreptitious editor of her own diary, expurgating all evidence that would contradict her carefully constructed image of herself and successfully manipulating everyone around her. Lorelei is not as dumb as she seems or as smart as she thinks she is. Making Lorelei a barely literate writer has the effect of estranging the reader from language. Loos makes sure we do not mistake these strategies for modernism—Lorelei is quick to dispatch the Conrad novels to her maid—but rather sustains the juxtaposition of mass and high culture.
	</p>
<p>
	  At least Molly Bloom reads her own novels, even if they are “smutty.” But while Molly’s undulating run-on sentences are most intelligible when read aloud, Lorelei’s language, if read aloud (the way Leavis, Connolly, and Lewis seem to have read it) would produce only a few laughs at the “rather clumsy gags” (for example, “A girl like I”; “champagne always makes me feel philosophical”). If we are fooled into thinking that we are hearing Lorelei’s voice (à la Molly Bloom) rather than seeing her script, we are failing to see what is in front of us on the page. There is almost no descriptive imagery in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, which is odd, given the “lookist” visual economy that rules the novel. Instead, Loos directs the reader to look at the words on the page, much in the same way that she scolds the cinema viewer who tries to pronounce ‘Count Xxerkzsxxv.’ One has to read and analyze the words on the page to <span style="font-style:italic;">see</span> Loos’s more intricate jokes. <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> follows the principles of Loos’s cinema writing and asks its audience to view language materially, as visual images.
	</p>
<p>
	  One reader who paid close attention to the words on the page, despite his declining vision, was James Joyce. In the same 1926 letter in which Joyce tells Harriet Shaw Weaver that he has read <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span>, he describes his “Work In Progress,” which he put aside to read Loos’s novel. The next week (15 November), in a letter signed “Jeems Joker,” he sends Weaver the opening paragraph of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> It is not difficult to imagine why <span style="font-style:italic;">Blondes</span> would have appealed to Joyce. Lorelei’s voice resonates with those of Joyce’s own Sirens (who appear, like Dorothy and Lorelei, “bronze by gold”), his Nausicaa, and his Penelope. In Joyce’s own exploration of a contemporary, uneducated woman’s voice in the final chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, he merely jettisons punctuation, while Loos toys with all levels of language except syntax. Lorelei’s mangling of several  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> languages—French and German as well as “the english landguage” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 88)—corresponds to the riot of languages in <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>. Lorelei’s felicitous phrases (for example, her “Eyefull Tower”) may have stayed with Joyce (“a waalworth of a skyerscape of most eyful hoyth entowerly” [4.35]). More than specific puns, however, it is Loos’s comic choreography of concretized language that seems relevant for Joyce.
	</p>
<p>
	  Loos was aware of modernist and avant-garde writing and art.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> She visited Stein at the rue de Fleurus, but was less interested in her writing—which she describes through Sherwood Anderson’s summary: “one should look on it as one looks at the palette of a painter, appreciate the words merely as words”—than she is in finding Stein, among Hemingway and Fitzgerald, “the most manly of the lot” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GI</span>, 228). Loos routinely calls attention to the surface of words like Stein or like Picasso’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Still Life with Chair Caning</span> , in which the letters “JOU” are incorporated into the image as literary artifact (from a newspaper) and also as a pun. What is remarkable about Loos is that she deploys the “mandarin” mode of heightened textuality as the guiding principle of vernacular forms of culture without being gnomic, obscure, or inaccessible. For Loos, there was no inherent contradiction between these ostensibly different orders of pleasure, only systems of cultural classification that made this seem so.
	</p>
<p>
	  When Lewis compared Loos to Stein, he argued that the former “intended to reassure the reader of the mass-democracy that all is well, and that the writer is one of the crowd . . . not a detested ‘highbrow.’”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> But Loos had a much wider audience in mind, and she aims to disarm rather than reassure, always sustaining the tension of cultural hierarchy as she views distinction from the middle of the Great Divide. Lorelei eagerly asserts the ways in which she is “literary”; simultaneously, Loos targets the self-styled “intelectuals” (modeled on Mencken) who fall for Lorelei but attempt to maintain their vaunted values of distinction. At the end of the novel, Lorelei convinces Spoffard to become a producer of titillating “pure films” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 12). (Their first production, “founded on the sex life of Dolly Madison,” stars Lorelei [<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 114]). Simultaneously, she collaborates on scripts with her man on the side, Mr. Montrose, a frustrated screenwriter who “had quite a hard time getting along in the motion picture profession, because all of his senarios are all over their head. Because when Mr. Montrose writes about sex, it is full of sychology, but when everybody else writes about it, it is full of nothing but transparent negligays and ornamental bath tubs” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B,</span> 115). Loos’s work found a wide audience precisely because of the way in which it allowed viewers and readers the pleasure of cultural distinction and its undoing: a testimony to general audiences’ capacity to embrace the pleasures of innovation, and to “high brow” audiences’ susceptibility to the less cerebral pleasures of “transparent negligays and ornamental bath tubs.” Loos’s success suggests that she produced her ideal audience: a consumer who could read images and see words.
	</p>
<p>
	  The sound film put an end to the linguistic play of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span>. Hawks’s film drastically revises the plot of the novel (Lorelei and Dorothy, now showgirls, sail to Europe for Lorelei’s wedding to Gus Esmond, and all but a few minutes of the film are set on the ship) and, most crucially, jettisons Loos’s first-person narration. What we gain in iconic sex appeal, we lose in textual complexity. Significantly, Dorothy’s jokes—broad irony—translated well to the sound film, while Lorelei’s did  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> not. The only witticisms retained in Hawks’s film are obvious grammatical mistakes and malapropisms—for example, the phrase “A girl like I,” and Lorelei asking for directions to “Europe, France.” The pleasure of the text has dissipated. The disappearance of the text in cinema was strikingly marked within the film industry by the first Academy Awards in 1929, which gave the first and only Best Title Writing award to Joseph Farnham. (Gerald C. Duffy was posthumously nominated for his work on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Private Life of Helen of Troy</span>, a film that sounds like a Spoffard production.) The same year, a special award was given to Warner Brothers for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span>, signaling what was to come. Ironically, some viewers, such as Q. D. Leavis, complained that the sound cinema further distanced people from the written word: “the ‘talkie’ . . . does not even offer captions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>, 56). While the particular kind of pleasure Loos developed—literary visual pleasure—disappeared from most films, her playful word images would become the stock in trade of the next literary generation.

	      Miriam Hansen employs the phrase “vernacular modernism” to avoid “the ideologically overdetermined term ‘popular.’” As she conceives of it, the term, which includes forms such as fashion, radio, and cinema, “combines the dimension of the quotidian, of everyday usage, with connotations of discourse, idiom, and dialect.” See “The Mass Production of the Senses: Classical Cinema as Vernacular Modernism,” <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 6:2 (April 1999), 59–77.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  Using the careers of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein as examples, this article examines the creation of literary celebrity in the early twentieth century as a complex recursive process that involves authorial actions, the production of specific works, the promotion of texts and their authors, and audience reception. It ultimately contends that a more thorough exploration of this process can help scholars gain a better understanding of both the vocational sphere of authorship at the turn of the twentieth century and the texts produced at that time.

</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
      When F. Scott Fitzgerald submitted what would become his first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>, to Scribner’s for the third time in late 1919, young editor Maxwell Perkins had to deliver an impassioned speech to the board, effectively resigning over the book’s repeated dismissal, before <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span> was finally accepted for publication.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fitzgerald had only one story published in a major commercial magazine at this point in his career and was largely unknown outside the coterie of literary friends he had made during his undergraduate years at Princeton. Within a year, the novel became an essential text for many teenagers in the United States and Fitzgerald was heralded as the voice of the younger generation.
    </p>
<p>
      Gertrude Stein labored for nearly three decades to find a major publisher for her output, labored, that is, until writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> in the fall of 1932. Much like <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span>, this book was an immediate success. After excerpts appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span> sold its entire first printing, more than 5,000 copies, nine days in advance of its official publication date.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The immense popularity Stein achieved as a result of the book allowed her to begin publishing pieces from her massive collection of manuscripts. It also laid the groundwork for a successful tour of the United States in 1934. Stein’s trip from France was front-page news in nearly every New York newspaper and she was surrounded by interviewers and curiosity-seekers the moment she stepped off the boat.
    </p>
<p>
      While such stories of near-immediate national renown might seem commonplace today, the speed with which Fitzgerald’s and Stein’s names traveled across a continent and the extensive  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> opportunities that fame afforded them were relatively new phenomena in the early decades of the twentieth century. These phenomena were made possible, in turn, by the massive restructuring of the U.S. cultural landscape in the late nineteenth century. The rapid development of new resources and technologies that have come to be lumped under the general term “modernity” brought many people physically and imaginatively closer together. They also gave rise to processes that enabled the widespread consumption of relatively homogeneous products and messages. Thus, F. Scott Fitzgerald, three weeks after the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span>, could script an “interview” with himself and send it to his publishers in hopes that it might be reprinted simultaneously in newspapers, literary inserts, and book reviews around the country. He could, for the first time in history, anticipate submitting his opinions almost immediately to millions of contemporary readers across the continental United States.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Modernist Studies</h1>
<p>
	The early twentieth century has been studied extensively by celebrity scholars.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Part of the reason this period has received so much attention is because it marks both the first appearance of independent public relations firms and the film industry’s earliest forays into star promotion. For all the consideration that has been given to these significant developments, more attention needs to be paid to the complex interrelations between U.S. print and celebrity cultures at the time.
      </p>
<p>
	Newspapers and magazines began to reach national audiences during the last decades of the nineteenth century. This development helped to lay the groundwork for the sophisticated publicity campaigns of the 1910s and 1920s. It also encouraged national conversations about literature, conversations that became an important part of most major news publications in the early twentieth century. The increasing amount of space devoted to texts meant that columnists and writers kept a close eye on literary developments and almost any event or interesting detail could receive mention. Literary supplements, which provided a direct source of information about books and authors, became more popular as well. Inserts like the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> literary section expanded early in the century to meet the increased demand for such information and several prominent reviews were formed shortly thereafter. Both the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Herald Tribune’s Books</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Review of Literature</span> first appeared in the 1920s.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Gossip columns and literary reviews were so important in the years after the First World War that press agents who could develop relationships with columnists, and occasionally influence copy, often received significant advances for their services.
      </p>
<p>
	Beyond promoting conversations about literature, national media outlets provided authors with new channels for constructing public personae and they allowed writers to communicate rapidly with audiences all around the country. Conversely, readers’ engagements with literary texts were increasingly mediated by new sources of information about books and authors. Audiences also had greater access to writers after the turn of the twentieth century as book tours, promotional appearances, and public lectures became more common.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Critics early in the century often ignored or downplayed the importance of these complex engagements, particularly in connection with certain types of “literary” texts. One obvious reason for this attitude is that some authors at the time reacted to the increasing interpenetration of business and art by positioning themselves, at least nominally, in opposition to the market. Both F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, for instance, often attributed economic rather than aesthetic motivations to pieces of writing when they wanted to speak dismissively of them. Fitzgerald regularly disparaged his short story writing by describing it as a means of support for his “real” work, crafting novels. In one interview given in 1927, the year after he published his short story collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">All the Sad Young Men</span>, Fitzgerald said, “I keep myself pure in regard to my novels. I have written only three of them. Each one takes two or three years. Of course, there are my short stories--but, then, you have to live.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Stein similarly distinguished between what she referred to as her “moneymaking style,” and her “really creative one.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> She invoked this distinction most frequently in the mid-1930s, as a way of differentiating between her accessible and immensely popular memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, and her often obscure experimental writings.
      </p>
<p>
	Distinctions like these led some early scholars of modernist literature to propose that a select subset of authors strove to operate beyond the reaches of the marketplace or at least to create texts that were untainted by commercial impulses. While this extreme generalization can still be found in criticism today, many contemporary scholars, attentive to postmodern critiques of totalizing systems and poststructural disruptions of binary oppositions, have been highly critical of efforts to set “high” art in opposition to the mass market. Most critics reflecting on this shift, in what is now a well-worn story of the historical development of modernist studies, claim that the transformative re was Fredric Jameson. Jameson, in his widely-cited article, “Reification and Utopia in Mass Culture,” proposes that high culture and mass culture are interrelated and can only be understood through a historical analysis of their joint emergence under the conditions of capitalism.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> While some scholars have expressed unease with the wide acceptance of such a simplistic and linear narrative,<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> few would deny either the influence of Jameson’s work or the transformative effect that materialist critical approaches have had in the sphere of what is now called modernist studies. The last three decades have seen an explosion of volumes examining the various ways in which canonical authors, despite their occasionally dismissive rhetoric, have engaged with and been implicated in the marketplace.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Much as this work has complicated the traditional opposition between high culture and the mass market, many important developments continue to be subsumed into the more general operations of the marketplace. The increased cultural emphasis on celebrity personae in the early twentieth century is one area that needs more consideration. By the 1920s, there were enough products devoted to disseminating the images of, and information about, celebrities, from fan magazines to gossip columns to trading cards, that many historians and cultural scholars have unreflexively referred to the existence of a distinct “celebrity culture” during the era. Yet in Douglas Mao and Rebecca L. Walkowitz’s recent survey of studies devoted to “the marketing of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernism” in <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span>, celebrity did not even merit a mention.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> While this omission does not necessarily reflect a lack of interest in the topic, it does suggest the relatively unsystematic nature of contemporary approaches to literary celebrity. Much of the work in this area has emerged from studies of individual authors, either through close readings that examine the ways in which a particular re treated the subject of fame or surveys that explore how an author cultivated his or her persona. A relatively small number of texts focus on specific periods and even fewer pursue a general understanding of literary celebrity at a particular historical moment.
      </p>
<p>
	The following analyses lay the foundation for the latter kind of project by examining the creation of literary celebrity in the early twentieth century as a complex recursive process that involves authorial actions, the production of specific works, the promotion of texts and their authors, and audience reception. Subsequent sections briefly examine each of these forms of activity in order to demonstrate the impact that they could have on the image and reputation of writers. By emphasizing the potential effects that a wide range of res had on the production of authorial personae, this study seeks to complicate unreflexive conceptions that re a writer’s reputation as a static object readily discerned through the analysis of specific literary or critical works. In the increasingly media-saturated environment of the early twentieth century, public renown seems more usefully approached as the function of a dynamic process, a contested value that is continually renegotiated in multiple contexts by stars, fans, and a wide range of intermediary res.
      </p>
<p>
	To help contain my discussion of these issues, I will continue to use F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein as the primary examples in my analysis. I have chosen these two authors because they represent, by contemporary standards, “oppositional” career paths. F. Scott Fitzgerald received national recognition with the publication of his first novel and spent much of the next two decades struggling for critical respectability while writing for smaller and smaller audiences. Conversely, Stein spent decades generating cultural capital and cultivating relationships with influential patrons in the hopes of finding a publisher for her large collection of manuscripts. It was not until she was in her sixties, with a best-selling memoir to her credit, that she was finally able to secure a long-term publishing arrangement with Random House. Despite these different paths, both authors regularly engaged in self-fashioning efforts designed to influence responses to their work. Moreover, Stein and Fitzgerald shared a remarkably similar set of concerns about the potential effects such efforts might have on their reputations. In short, by focusing on the careers of these two res, I hope to illuminate the impact that celebrity media could have on authors regardless of their perceived ‘brow’ level or their cultural aspirations.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Textual Reception</h1>
<p>
	Many studies of the modern marketplace suggest the relevance that a systematic analysis of celebrity would have for the field as a whole, from Jennifer Wicke’s work on the dialectical relationship between advertising discourse and literature to Lawrence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Rainey’s examination of the material conditions underwriting modernist textual production. Rainey’s study in particular foregrounds the new strategies of authorial self-construction necessitated by economic and cultural developments in the early twentieth century. What these and many other works suggest, on the most general level, is that celebrity discourse, even in the earliest decades of the twentieth century, functioned as an important site for constructing meanings around texts.
      </p>
<p>
	Part of the reason this point has not been made more forcefully by scholars is that it stands in direct opposition to conventional theorizations of modernist textuality. Aaron Jaffe usefully elaborates these ideas in his study of modernist literature’s “promotional logic.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Jaffe argues that avant-garde writers were not removed from the scene of the mass market, but instead instantiated themselves indirectly in it by creating literary objects that bear a specific “stylistic stamp.” This stamp, or “imprimatur,” served the dual purpose of distinguishing a text from others in the marketplace and of sanctioning that text, particularly as the specific name attached to it began to accumulate value in the literary sphere. The endpoint of this “logic,” then, is that modernist authors successfully operated in the marketplace by turning themselves into “formal artifact[s].”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Jaffe’s book provides a useful account of one way in which writers accumulated cultural capital while at times remaining overtly opposed to the market. His focus on this particular form of “promotional logic,” however, moves his study away from any direct evaluation of the influential publicity efforts that such a logic dismisses as secondary. It would be difficult to argue, for instance, that T. S. Eliot, a major re in Jaffe’s study, gave public lectures in order to promote himself as a formally dispersed textual object, even though, as Jaffe would assert, both Eliot and the New Critics would have considered any publicity generated by the lectures irrelevant to the study of Eliot’s work. It is in part by dismissing these activities and focusing attention on the “masterpiece,” theorized as an autonomous repository of literary value, that many authors and critics were able to cultivate an air of objectivity and supposedly insulate their work from the corrupting influence of promotional activities.
      </p>
<p>
	One important consequence of these theories is that they help to deter questions about the potential influence marketing efforts could have on readers and critics. A brief look at the publicity surrounding F. Scott Fitzgerald in the early 1920s will demonstrate how useful such an analysis can be. Initially, Fitzgerald was promoted as both a brilliant writer and a representative example of the impetuous young adults that populated his early work. Advertisements, interviews, and Fitzgerald’s own autobiographical essays all emphasized his youth, his fast-paced lifestyle, and his literary talents. Over the next few years, as Fitzgerald’s antics kept his face in the newspapers and reinforced his image as a debauched young man, many of the articles written by and about him reiterated other aspects of his persona. Fitzgerald himself was quite fond of emphasizing how effortlessly he produced his popular stories. In one piece, Fitzgerald uses his experience writing the short story “The Ice Palace” to explain his “theory that, except in a certain sort of naturalistic realism, what you enjoy writing [and thus write quickly] is liable to be much better reading than what you labor over.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In another autobiographical article, he implicitly applies this theory to all of his early short stories, claiming, “the quickest [was] written in an hour and a half, the slowest in three days.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The success of this powerful media campaign can be seen in highbrow critics’ responses to Fitzgerald’s first two novels. Reactions to <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>  were incredibly diverse in tone and content, ranging from the lavish praise of H. L. Mencken, who calls the book “a truly amazing first novel--original in structure, extremely sophisticated in manner, and adorned with . . . brilliancy,” to the ambivalence of R.V.A.S., who applauds <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span> as “fundamentally honest,” but finds “the intellectual and spiritual analyses . . . sometimes tortuous and the nomenclature bewildering.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> By the time <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> was published in March 1922, however, many highbrow critics had reached a consensus about Fitzgerald’s work: the always-lively Fitzgerald certainly had talent, but he had not worked hard enough to master his abilities.
      </p>
<p>
	Gilbert Seldes, writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span>, asserts that Fitzgerald’s flippant attitude towards art overrides his considerable skill as a writer and severely damages the book.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Similarly, Henry Beston, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, writes, “The present endeavor marks no advance [over <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>] in either method or philosophy of life,” though “the book is alive, very much alive.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> John Peale Bishop, an established poet and friend, wrote a particularly scathing review of the book in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Herald</span>. Bishop begins by claiming that the protagonist, Anthony Patch, is “a re through whom Mr. Fitzgerald may write of himself,” and then launches into a series of attacks on Patch/Fitzgerald, mentioning, among other problems, his “inherent laziness” and his “illusion that he is rather superior in intellect and character to the persons about him.” This belief, however, is not true according to Bishop because Patch/Fitzgerald is merely the sort of man who “spent his time among many books without deriving from them either erudition or richness of mind.” Finally, after listing a series of more general problems with the book, he concludes, “these are flaws of vulgarity in one who is awkward with his own vigor.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The uniformity of these reviews is startling, especially given the wide variety of responses to <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>. In just two short years, this particular group of critics, many of whom railed against the ever-expanding celebrity media outlets and bemoaned the credulity of undereducated audiences, had come to an implicit consensus about Fitzgerald based in part on his media-generated persona.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The only significant difference between Fitzgerald’s self-presentation and reviewers’ depictions of the author was the standard they used to assess his persona. These critics all seemed to agree that Fitzgerald did, as he repeatedly claimed, have a natural talent for writing. Yet, for men who used education and an aura of sophistication to garner both cultural and financial capital, Fitzgerald’s supposed gift was not something, in and of itself, worthy of praise. They valued instead the industrious learning and knowledge of tradition that set them apart from more popular and, in some circles, less respected writers. Fitzgerald’s public disdain for just such labor, then, is precisely what prevents his work from being considered “True Literature,” a title that highbrow critics considered themselves uniquely able to confer.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Critics, of course, were not the only ones influenced by such large and sophisticated marketing campaigns. Knowledge of public personae could help to guide general readers’ interpretations of texts and, in more extreme cases, could even be said to replace  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the need to read altogether. Janice Radway has demonstrated how some texts in the 1910s and 1920s were promoted as objects of knowledge rather than as literary works that contained inherent value. Thus, educated middle-class readers who were anxious about remaining “current” could potentially reap social benefits by knowing about the currently fashionable literary titles rather than actually reading them.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Similarly, authorial personae functioned as an important site of knowledge production that could ultimately displace the texts upon which a writer’s fame supposedly rested. For instance, when Gertrude Stein came to the United States for a lecture tour in 1934, newspapers tracked her movements and some of the major papers even ran extended commentaries on the trip. Yet the focus was rarely on Stein’s writing or the content of her speeches, which had at least nominally occasioned the notices in the first place. Her clothes, her demeanor, and her effect on audiences regularly took precedence. (<span style="font-style:italic;">For more on Stein’s lecture tour, particularly her time in Chicago, see Liesl Olson’s article in this issue.</span>)
      </p>
<p>
	In addition, while people came in surprising numbers to hear Stein’s lectures, very few of them demonstrated a desire to learn more about Stein’s ideas. In one oft-told story, the author fired her tour organizer, Marvin Ross, shortly after arriving in the United States because over 1,700 people had tickets for one of her opening lectures at Columbia University, far more that the five-hundred-person limit she had specified. The transcripts of her talks, however, subsequently published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures in America</span>, sold poorly. In other words, this bold and mysterious woman who had long been a topic of conversation in the American press, gaining such nicknames as the Mama of Dada, Mother Goose of Montparnasse, the high-priestess of the Left Bank, the Mother of Modernism, and the queen bee of the expatriate hive, had managed to generate a significant amount of interest in her appearances without drawing audiences to her ideas. At the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, Stein’s memoir about the lecture tour, she explains this phenomena to her publisher, Alfred Harcourt: “Harcourt was very surprised when I said to him on first meeting him in New York remember this extraordinary welcome that I am having does not come from the books of mine that they do understand like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> but the books of mine that they did not understand.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity, Textual Production, and Promotion</h1>
<p>
	One danger of focusing on the reception of texts is that it often leads critics to oversimplify the production process and place an inordinate emphasis on the agency of particular individuals. It would not be difficult, for instance, to take Stein’s quote as an indication that her difficult texts were conceived as part of a larger effort to convince readers that she was, as she so often claimed to be, a “genius.” By extension, the high/low aesthetic divide can seem like little more than a tactical move perpetrated by authors trying to find a space in a thoroughly commodified literary marketplace. The complexity of a text certainly did have an impact on the way writers were categorized by readers; moreover, writers of all dispositions did attempt to shape the way they  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> were perceived by audiences. The efforts of individual authors, however, always exist within, even as they contribute to the formation of, a complex system of institutions and practices. The image of Stein that appeared in conjunction with the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, for instance, was noticeably affected by the prevailing conditions in the publishing industry, a field which had long struggled with the gradual commodification of literary texts.
      </p>
<p>
	As business and art became increasingly intermingled in the emerging consumer culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many publishers remained committed to the idea that art could possess an inherent, and transcendent, value not dictated by the operations of the marketplace. George Doran, for instance, an early partner of Frank Doubleday, often complained that good literature could not be successfully promoted. By the mid-1930s, when even “high” modernist authors like Joyce and Stein had published best-sellers after notable publicity campaigns, Doran ruefully commented in his memoirs, “the great profession of publishing has measurably degenerated into a business of mass production where each highly enterprising publisher of the era seeks by advertisement and other ultra-modern methods to outsell his contemporaries.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Doran’s fear that advertising led directly to the degradation of literature was not uncommon at the time. Henry Holt, for instance, had made a similar complaint thirty years earlier in a review of Walter Hines Page’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Publisher’s Confession</span>: “Books are not bricks, and . . . the more they are treated as bricks, the more they tend to become bricks.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	If the U.S.’s emergent consumer culture was already a concern for some established publishers at the turn of the twentieth century, the situation became far more problematic for those who attempted to form new houses in subsequent decades. Catherine Turner has demonstrated how, during the 1910s and 1920s, Donald Brace, Bennett Cerf, Alfred Harcourt, Donald Klopfer, Alfred Knopf, and Horace Liveright were all forced to mediate between the increasingly complex demands of an intensely competitive literary marketplace and the genteel notions of traditional publishing houses. A new firm could secure its reputation by supporting “quality” literature, that is, texts whose value did not, at least in theory, depend on sales. Yet, to remain competitive, the new firms had to employ the latest marketing techniques in order to promote both themselves and their books.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The contradictions that arose from such a position are readily apparent in Alfred Harcourt’s massive publicity campaign for Gertrude Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>. Advertisements appeared in all of the major literary supplements proclaiming Stein’s role as an “eminent American woman” at the forefront of contemporary artistic production. She had, many ads proclaimed, the knowledge to explain “why modern literature <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span>.” By implicitly constructing “modern literature” as something difficult, a phenomenon that needs explicating, Harcourt could draw on Stein’s reputation as an avant-garde author as well as on the gradually accumulating cultural capital of “modern literature.” Yet the ads also emphasize the readability of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span> and its sheer entertainment value. This memoir will be, the ads promise, both a major part of modern literature and a straightforward guide to the rarefied world of high art.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Such an advertising campaign reveals the complex interrelation of public personae, market conditions, and aesthetic theory in the early decades of the twentieth century. It also suggests how many different res in the book industry helped to shape the images that emerged before the public. While interactions among publishers, editors, and authors have been explored at some length in recent scholarship on the “marketing of modernism,” the impact that these people had on the cultivation of celebrity personae has received relatively little attention. Many other res crucial to the process have also fallen outside the purview of much contemporary scholarship, including literary agents and journalists.
      </p>
<p>
	If the previous example suggests one way that Stein’s image may have been inflected by external forces, Fitzgerald’s attempt to refashion his persona during the 1930s demonstrates how little control writers often had over their own personae. As noted above, Fitzgerald cultivated the image of an impetuous genius during the early years of his career and he was regularly characterized in the press as the voice of a new generation. By the end of the decade, however, Fitzgerald’s situation had radically changed. His alcoholism, on-going problems with <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender is the Night</span>, which would take him the better part of a decade to complete, and troubles with his wife Zelda, who was hospitalized in April 1930 and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, all began to take a toll on both the author and his career. Work became increasingly difficult for Fitzgerald and he spent considerably less time in, or seeking to be in, the public eye. In part as a result of these factors, Fitzgerald’s name retained its connection with the Jazz Age long after the Great Depression had redirected both public and literary discourse.
      </p>
<p>
	To counter the perception that he was a washed-up alcoholic, Fitzgerald began consistently adopting the persona of a sober, reflective literary man in his autobiographical writings during the 1930s. “One Hundred False Starts” , a humorous piece detailing the various unfinished projects that fill the author’s notebook, serves as a useful contrast to his earlier pieces. Unlike his articles from the 1920s, which repeatedly emphasize how easy writing is, this article takes as its subject the countless pages the narrator must write or, in the racing metaphor that dominates the piece, the “days and days” he must “crouch” in order to create the mere handful of publishable stories attributed to his name (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 130). The overriding irony of the piece, that is, Fitzgerald’s ultimate ability to take these failures and create a highly amusing story out of them, enhances its humor and helps to undercut the darker implications that could be read into Fitzgerald’s many “false starts.” He appears not as a washed-up alcoholic stuck in a pattern of failure but as a fairly typical writer struggling with the difficulties of his craft. After reiterating that he is “in every sense a professional,” Fitzgerald concludes the piece by praising hard work and the extensive experience, gained through false starts as well as successful writing, necessary to make that work productive (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 131).
      </p>
<p>
	Ultimately, the narrator of “One Hundred False Starts” suggests that this new outlook has changed both the writer himself and the kind of pieces he is capable of writing. One of his notebook entries, “Article: Unattractive Things Girls Do, to pair with counter article by woman,” recalls an earlier set of pieces Fitzgerald did with Zelda for <span style="font-style:italic;">McCall’s</span> in response to the question, “Does a Moment of Revolt Come Sometime to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Every Married Man?” From his current position, the narrator cannot even put the topic into proper perspective and he narrows the title from universal female characteristics to those reflecting “a great majority” of women to “a strong minority.” He finally gives up the article fragment as a remnant of a distant “gilded age,” a decision that takes on even greater significance in light of the fact that the author rarely attempted anything like his earlier pieces in the 1930s (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 128).
      </p>
<p>
	Fitzgerald cultivated this reflective and, perhaps more importantly, sober image throughout much of the decade. His autobiographical writings, his literary commentaries, and even many of his interviews portray a thoughtful and committed artist that stands in sharp contrast to the brash young genius of his early publicity pieces. Despite these fairly consistent efforts, Fitzgerald’s previous image continued to follow him in various forms throughout his life.
      </p>
<p>
	The inability to develop a new persona was not entirely negative for Fitzgerald, in part because his name periodically resurfaced during the Great Depression in popular references to the Jazz Age. If such mentions often ignored his continuing existence and referred only to a handful of early accomplishments, they did help him remain visible to the larger public.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> However remote this success may have seemed, Fitzgerald was still able to cash in on these old associations in his later years. In the summer of 1937, a time when he was regularly earning only $250 for a short story and had made less than $3,500 in six months, Fitzgerald was able to find work as a scriptwriter for MGM at a salary of $1,000 per week. His first job, not surprisingly, was to help patch up the script for <span style="font-style:italic;">A Yank at Oxford</span> , a movie about a young American student in England.
      </p>
<p>
	The flip side of Fitzgerald’s lingering association with the past was that many of his contemporaries dismissed him. As Budd Schulberg, who worked with Fitzgerald on the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Carnival</span> in 1939, later said, “My generation thought of F. Scott Fitzgerald as an age rather than as a writer, and when the economic strike of 1929 began to change the sheiks and flappers into unemployed boys and underpaid girls, we consciously and a little belligerently turned our backs on Fitzgerald.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Moreover, when Schulberg, who had long been an admirer of Fitzgerald’s fiction, first learned they would be collaborating together, he was surprised to hear Fitzgerald was still alive.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> And Schulberg was not alone. When Fitzgerald gained some notoriety for a series of articles he published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> about having a nervous breakdown, editor Arnold Gingrich quipped that any publicity would help a man many people thought was dead.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Even Fitzgerald’s partner, British columnist Sheilah Graham, claimed that she had, at first, associated his name only with the 1920s.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Celebrity and Authorship</h1>
<p>
	Fitzgerald’s on-going struggle with his public image reflects the increased importance of promotional activity in the early decades of the twentieth century. Over his twenty-year career as a professional writer, Fitzgerald wrote dozens of autobiographical, or seemingly autobiographical, pieces for popular magazines, gave numerous interviews, scripted several “interviews” of his own, and he participated, particularly during the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> early years of his career, in many well-publicized spectacles that made good copy for the gossip columns. He also worked with his editor and agent on the production and promotion of his texts. A quick glance through any of his business correspondence will offer numerous examples of these efforts.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> He was particularly concerned with production issues, making suggestions to his publishers about everything from layouts and fonts to bindings and the use of blurbs on dust jackets. He worried about the timing and manner of publication, including forms of serialization, the use of book clubs, and the size of his volumes. Finally, he suggested marketing tactics that would maximize the sale of his books.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Stein was also an ardent self-promoter who spent several decades circulating her work in three different countries. She cultivated relationships with famous artists, writers, publishers, and editors. She sent copies of her books to popular reviewers and critics. She even began writing “portraits” of famous and influential acquaintances at least in part to help her work gain wider visibility.
      </p>
<p>
	In 1911, for instance, she wrote her well-known portrait of Mabel Dodge, a wealthy patron of the arts who had visited Stein’s studio the year before. Dodge liked the piece enough to have it published in a private edition, which she circulated among her friends in Europe and New York. Dodge subsequently wrote the first major explication of Stein’s writing in conjunction with the Armory Show, an art exhibit designed to increase the visibility of contemporary French, German, and Spanish artists in the United States. Dodge’s essay, entitled “Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose,” was first run in the March 1913 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Arts and Decoration</span> and then re-run, along with Stein’s portrait, in the June issue of Arthur Stieglitz’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Camera Work</span>. Stein had similar success a few years later with her portrait of art critic Henry McBride, who also had the piece printed in a private edition and helped to secure its publication in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span>.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Again, such preoccupations with publicity were not uncommon in the early decades of the twentieth century. As Ann Douglas summarizes, “the dangerous business of attention management and exploitation fascinated all the writers of [this] generation, whether as subject matter or life-style or both.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> res as diverse as T. S. Eliot and Marianne Moore, Willa Cather and Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein all wrestled with the new media apparatus and emerging forms of promotion.
      </p>
<p>
	However, the claim that many, if not all, modernist authors deliberately engaged in some market activity is not necessarily as radical in its implications as some contemporary scholars might contend. Such a position does not mean that earlier work done on writers’ disdain for the market, or on the high/low binary that these studies frequently posit, must simply be discarded. It would be difficult to argue, for instance, that an underlying conception of “pure” art, existing outside the reach of a degraded and degrading mass culture, did not have imaginative appeal in the early decades of the twentieth century. Thus, as Michael Nowlin points out, Ann Douglas presses the point a bit too far when she applies Charlie Chaplin’s term “high lowbrow” as a general descriptor for a wide range of artists simultaneously seeking fame and critical acclaim in the 1920s. The situation was never quite as open or liberatory as this phrase suggests.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Many authors, like both Fitzgerald and Stein, participated in promotional activities while, at times, rhetorically distancing themselves from their own efforts. The year after Fitzgerald’s first novel made him a household name, he wrote his editor, “My one hope is to be endorsed by the intellectually elite &amp; thus be forced on to people as Conrad has.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This statement is a striking bit of posturing for a best-selling author who had begun sending self-promotional blurbs to his publishers as soon as his first book was released.
      </p>
<p>
	Gertrude Stein also regularly downplayed her own promotional efforts, particularly when communicating with aesthetes. She frequently gave acquaintances the impression that she had no concern for publishing or selling her work, as when she wrote Henry McBride, a critic who saw success as a corrupting influence on artists, to deny that she had any intention of writing a popular autobiography. This particular letter to McBride was written just a few years before Stein began <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> and, when she wrote it, Stein had already given literary agent William Aspinwell Bradley the explicit directive to make her rich and famous. At the same time, she was advising young writers such as Paul Bowles about the importance of cultivating large audiences, advice that certainly contradicted her own supposed commitment to non-commercial art.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Perhaps the most commonly cited example of Stein’s highbrow posturing emerged from the notable success of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography</span>. In “And Now,” an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span> shortly before Stein left for her lecture tour, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, Stein’s account of the tour published in 1937, she claims to have suffered a bout of writer’s block after becoming a best-selling author. While these statements might, at first glance, support a reading of Stein as a stereotypical anti-market modernist, this interpretation becomes problematic when the larger context is taken into account. Stein is worrying about her popularity in texts written specifically for mass audiences. In light of this fact, it seems quite limiting to read her professed anxiety outside of its constitutive function in the sphere of celebrity discourse. In the process of proving she can be both a commercial and a critical success, Stein reasserts the existence of these two separate fields of value and suggests the conflict between them. In this way, her anxiety can be read not simply as a reflection of her internal struggle but as a rhetorical move that inscribes the category of “high” art in what is supposedly an antithetical form of discourse.
      </p>
<p>
	This reading is supported by Stein’s descriptions of her writer’s block. She does not attempt, in either piece, to show the psychological effects of a breakdown in her writing process, nor does she attempt to detail her own tentative steps towards a resolution to the problem. Instead, she emphasizes the act of <span style="font-style:italic;">reflection</span>, which is to say she depicts herself, in a characteristically even tone, as someone who has overcome her difficulties. This position allows Stein to navigate between what Pierre Bourdieu has called “the field of restricted production,” in which artists produce for a coterie of elite consumers, and “the field of large-scale production,” in which artists produce for a more generalized “public.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> On one hand, Stein is crafting pieces that are intended for a mass audience. On the other, her supposed psychological difficulty with this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> process reflects a commitment to the values of the avant-garde, even as the posited state of resolution implicitly assures her audience that these issues have no bearing on the piece at hand. Put more simply, the trope of writer’s-block-overcome allows Stein to emphasize her status as an elite artist who has strong reservations about the literary marketplace while she is simultaneously writing pieces that will be marketed to a broad reading public.
      </p>
<p>
	This example demonstrates how an examination of celebrity media can do more than expand our historical knowledge of textual production and consumption at the turn of the century. It can also revitalize analyses of a wide range of texts produced during this period. The latter point is particularly important for scholars attempting to push beyond earlier binary approaches to the same material. The previous examples should make it apparent that traditional oppositions between “high” art and the marketplace do not sufficiently account for some of the major strategies of self-representation employed by Anglo-American writers in the early decades of the twentieth century. Authors who aspired to acquire cultural capital often found themselves negotiating between the supposedly degraded aesthetic forms of the mass market and the dictates of an increasingly prominent celebrity culture. Such writers did not want to be associated with the often anonymous hacks creating so-called “production line” pulp novels, nor did they want their output to be controlled by either the whims of the marketplace or publishers’ marketing machines. These conditions necessitated a distinct authorial presence to ensure the integrity of a given work. Yet authors could not simply market themselves and allow their personae to propel sales, as that would ultimately undermine claims about the autonomy, and the supposedly transcendent value, of “true” art.
      </p>
<p>
	Thus, even a basic understanding of the modernist author represented through “style,” as the selective consciousness suffused throughout a work but never directly represented in it, requires a tacit acknowledgement of the importance of public personae in aesthetic theories and practices during the early twentieth century. When put in these terms, it seems plausible to argue that the changing strategies of authorial self-representation at this time were as much a function of developing celebrity media and increasing public fascination with famous personalities as they were of changed epistemologies or the expanding circuits of consumerism. Pressing such discussions further could allow them to intersect with other contemporary critical conversations about representation, the relationship between modernism and postmodernism, the status of authorship, the regulation of aesthetic categories and hierarchies, the relation of print media to visual media, and the space of the “literary” within the larger cultural field. In all of these areas, celebrity could function as a useful interpretive paradigm, both from a historical perspective and as a unifying concept for textual analyses. On more traditional grounds, it provides a basis for rethinking key elements of modernist culture even as it points to new ways in which binary models can be expanded to better reflect the complex position of writers in the early twentieth century.
      </p>
<p>
	The emergence of a whole subset of cultural artifacts devoted to disseminating information about stars, both real and potential, raised many challenges for people working in the literary field. Yet the complex ways in which writers and other intermediary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> res responded to these difficulties, and the ways in which their efforts were received by an increasingly fragmented reading public, suggest many fruitful areas of inquiry that remain underserved by contemporary modernist scholarship. Both Stein and Fitzgerald attempted to cultivate recognizable images and promote their work to a wide audience. At the same time, they aligned themselves in many ways with elite conceptions of art and often denounced the very tactics they employed. These messages were then refracted through the work of various promoters and publishers before being taken up and/or transformed by journalists, critics, and readers, whose responses, in turn, often inspired more authorial posturing.
      </p>
<p>
	By tracing the specific historical contours of this recursive process, scholars can gain a better understanding of both the vocational sphere of authorship at the turn of the century and the texts produced at that time. Such analysis can also provide benefits that extend well beyond the field of modernist studies. A more systematic engagement with celebrity during this period, and the ways in which particular forms of celebrity media developed, will offer valuable insights into the subsequent restructuring of the cultural field in the latter half of the twentieth century. Understanding the shifting values associated with certain types of public personae might even help to explain the seemingly diminished space afforded to popular authors’ personae in recent decades. So, through more sustained analysis of modern celebrity, we can not only come to a better understanding of a world where Stein’s public appearances and Fitzgerald’s drunken antics were prominent news items, but we can also more readily approach a culture in which writers are rarely afforded such attention.

	  I do not mean to suggest that Fitzgerald’s publicity exerted a simple deterministic force on critics. It was only one of many factors that helped a particular reading of Fitzgerald’s life and work gain purchase at this time. It would, however, be difficult to examine the critical reception of Fitzgerald’s early works without taking his public persona into account.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

	    Perhaps the most famous account from this period came from another of Fitzgerald’s Princeton acquaintances, Edmund Wilson, who said that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> was “animated with life” and acknowledged that Fitzgerald had “an instinct for graceful and vivid prose.” He also said, “[Fitzgerald] has been given imagination without intellectual control of it; he has been given the desire for beauty without an aesthetic ideal; and he has been given a gift for expression without very many ideas to express.” Wilson, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shores of Light</span> (New York: Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc., 1952), 27. Less than a year before, Wilson wrote Fitzgerald a letter criticizing America’s “commercialism” and the “ease with which a traditionless and half-educated [American] public . . . can be impressed, delighted, and satisfied.” Wilson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters on Literature and Politics, 1912–1972</span>, Elena Wilson, ed.

	    Any discussion of Fitzgerald’s personal feelings about these references would take me far outside the scope of my argument. I will merely say that evidence suggests he was quite ambivalent about his lingering persona. On one hand, he still clearly felt pride in these notices and collected clippings until his death. For relevant selections from Fitzgerald’s scrapbooks, see Matthew J. Bruccoli, Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, and Joan P. Kerr, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">The Romantic Egoists</span> (Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1974), 204–205. On the other hand, Fitzgerald was not always pleased by these mentions, in part because they conflicted with his efforts to construct a more “literary” image. In a semi-autobiographical piece published in late 1936, “Afternoon of an Author,” the narrator stops to listen to music and bitterly remarks, “so long since he had danced, perhaps two evenings in five years, yet a review of his last book had mentioned him as being fond of night clubs; the same review had also spoken of him as being indefatigable. Something in the sound of the word in his mind broke him momentarily and feeling tears of weakness behind his eyes he turned away. It was like in the beginning fifteen years ago when they said he had ‘fatal facility,’ and he labored like a slave over every sentence” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AFT</span>, 181).

	  During the months just prior to the publication of any of his books, nearly every letter he wrote to his editor contained suggestions about publishing or marketing. His letter on February 5, 1934, shortly before the book publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Is the Night</span>, provides a telling example. First, he reminds Perkins that the indentations and the layout of his name on the cover should correspond with all of his other books. Then he warns against playing up the fact that some of the action in the book occurs in resorts on the Riviera, as the setting would only feed misconceptions of his work as trivial. He also discourages the use of blurbs because “the public is very, very, very weary of being sold bogus goods.” Finally, he suggests mentioning that several scenes were cut when the book was serialized in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scribner’s</span> magazine to entice people who had already read it.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  2010 marks the anniversary of a slightly older, and less strident, Futurism than that made (in)famous by the Italian impresario, F. T. Marinetti. On June 18, 1904, the Mallorcan poet and journalist Gabriel Alomar delivered his lengthy lecture, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, which subsequently achieved a certain prominence in European literary circles. Various scholars have squared off as to the extent of Marinetti’s indebtedness to the Catalan’s precedent. Yet <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span> need not be held hostage--whether nominally or notionally, politically or poetically--to its disparities from 
	  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
	    any
	  </span> 
	  other iteration of “futurism.” Aside from its importance to the fitful developments of twentieth-century Catalan and Spanish culture, and its unclassifiable resistance to various categorical imperatives (whether <span style="font-style:italic;">modernisme</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">noucentisme</span>, or unreconstructed <span style="font-style:italic;">catalanisme</span>), the text merits further consideration as a tract on its own terms. It is hoped that the present rendering--the first substantial translation in English--will at the very least afford Alomar’s writing more scholarly attention in the Anglo-American world.

<div id="body">
<p>
      With fanfare both ceremonious and critical, 2009 witnessed the exhumation of an incendiary tract that had demanded to be buried like a dead letter: the “Founding and Manifesto of Futurism” , which, now a noble manuscript in its own right, has found itself prodded back into the limelight over the past year like a reluctant Lazarus.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first in a long series of raucous interventions penned by F. T. Marinetti—poet, publisher, and tireless promoter—the manifesto appeared on the front page of Paris’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> on February 20, 1909. Seeking to liberate Italy from its role as Europe’s cultural cemetery—a storehouse of relics, an open-air museum for the ages—Marinetti proposed a ruthless purge of his country’s aesthetic and poetic sentimentalisms. He launched his venture from the most modern of European capitals, in a widely distributed daily; the hurly burly of the manifesto’s reception duly catapulted his ambitious program onto the world stage. For all of Marinetti’s famous condemnations of <span style="font-style:italic;">passéisme</span>, however, the shibboleth of his own movement was, by 1909, already a bit old hat.
    </p>
<p>
      We might think of 2010, in fact, as marking the incidental anniversary of a slightly older, less strident, Futurism. On June 18, 1904, the Mallorcan poet and journalist Gabriel Alomar (1873–1941; <a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) delivered his lengthy lecture, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, to a small audience at Barcelona’s Ateneu (a private literary society). The redacted version of his address appeared the following year in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">l’Avenç</span> (“advance,” “progress”)—an outlet, as its name would suggest, of Catalan political vanguardism—before  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> being translated into Castilian and published as a slim volume. Reviews in the Parisian <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France</span> and other publications further circulated the basic tenets of <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, as well as the importunate ambition of its name, throughout some prominent literary circles.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>
      Marinetti likely first caught wind of Alomar’s essay through Marcel Robin’s substantial 1908 review in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure</span>, a journal that Marinetti—like the better part of forward-thinking individuals in turn-of-the-century Paris—read avidly, and to which he occasionally contributed. This fact was not lost on Alomar, who reacted vehemently against the expropriation of his title, accusing Marinetti, in March 1909, of plagiarism.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> At the latter’s professed ignorance of Alomar’s essay, the Spanish poet Ruben Darío insisted, already in 1909, that the Italian impresario recognize “the priority of the word if not the entire doctrine.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> It remains impossible to verify the extent to which Marinetti availed himself of <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span> or its subsequent translations and reiterations.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The tracing of Alomar’s potential influence on Marinetti will necessarily remain speculative. Since Lily Litvak resurrected Alomar’s text from relative oblivion a few decades ago, however, scholars have squared off as to the extent of Marinetti’s indebtedness to the Catalan’s precedent.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      Alomar’s text did not prere Marinetti’s Futurist venture in any prescriptive, or even descriptive, sense. To be sure, the Catalan’s Futurists are notably “hyperaesthetic,” and he insists upon poetry and art as the only possible vehicles of social and political renewal. Yet he is not eager to adumbrate what his “future” will look like, nor to disarticulate and reconre—as Marinetti would—the very terms in which it might be conceived, conveyed, or hastened. The rupture with academic dogma and religious fetishism, Alomar promises, will entail a certain violence. But the look and feel of that violence in his rations—manifested as a butterfly shrugging off its chrysalis, for instance—seem naïve compared with the hard-bitten sneers of the century’s modernism that followed. Even when Alomar excoriates the encrusted institutions that his futurists would vanquish, his language remains eminently civil in tone, texture, and lilt. As Marcel Robin noted in his early review in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure</span>, while the rhapsodic energy of Alomar’s language is stirring, the dimensions of his particular “future” remain elusive.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Alomar’s invectives against “the catacombs of pedantic erudition,” and “our putrid educational system” stand, perhaps, as his most proto-Marinettian pronouncements— echoed in countless Italian tirades against “the despotism of pedantic academies,” and “the virus of routine, of imitation and pedantry.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Likewise Alomar’s harsh critique of the Church—and its hold on education in Spain and Catalonia (and, thus, his native Mallorca)—anticipates Marinetti’s violent denunciations of clericalism in both rhetoric and tone. The regeneration of Catalonian culture in particular significantly subtends Alomar’s project. His <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span>, in short, is inseparable from his <span style="font-style:italic;">catalanisme</span>. To a great extent, he conceived of the former as a handmaiden to the latter.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> As Jordi Castellanos has argued, Alomar helped to reconre the very concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">catalanisme</span>, from a retardataire dogma “opposed to modernity,” to a youth-driven sensibility increasingly in sync with a burgeoning literary avant-garde.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Any comparison with Marinetti’s writing is conditioned not only by the texts’ different formats and rations, but also by the divergent trajectories that they carved out for their respective authors. Alomar’s essay inspired the founding of a few journals under the (somewhat amorphous) designation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span>, as early as 1907. Though Alomar contributed to their short runs, his address at the Ateneu did not usher in a larger movement, whether aesthetic or political. As his project became rather quickly superseded by the increasingly reactionary impulses of Catalan <span style="font-style:italic;">Noucentisme</span>—headed by Eugeni d’Ors after 1906—Alomar channeled his own energies into more wide-ranging journalistic pursuits. Marinetti, by contrast, dedicated his entire life to the development of Futurism, as both an exponentially interdisciplinary enterprise and a political program. Whereas that program found an afterlife in—indeed, served as an animating prolepsis to—Italian Fascism, Alomar’s writings were largely shirked not only by d’Ors’s conservative agenda, but also by the dictatorships that followed.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Marinetti agitated unabashedly for Italian colonial expansion. The same year as he penned <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, Alomar, by contrast, dedicated an entire work to the defense of Algeria against French colonialism.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Alomar repeatedly disavows a facile nationalism in <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, taking pains at every turn to inflect his Catalanism with conditions and caveats.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      Despite its extensive appeals to a renewed poetic sensibility, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span> stands more as a treatise on political economy than an aesthetic manifesto, more a humanist homily than a proposed transvaluation of language itself. Its language represents, in fact, a hodgepodge of various nineteenth- and turn-of-the-century modes (transcendentalist, theosophic, and anthroposophic), shot through as much as with lingering Enlightenment principles as with anti-positivist, Bergsonian inflections. For Alomar, Giosuè Carducci’s “Hymn to Satan” still epitomized radical defiance; Marinetti and his cohorts dismissed the same poetry as “nostalgically monotonous weepy”—the epitome of <span style="font-style:italic;">passéisme</span>, despite its ostensible iconoclasm.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> While Alomar rejects as deficient the wan, “plaster model” of man cast by nature, he res its futurist foil as a marble statue—a metaphor inimical to Marinetti’s mechanized poetics, even constitutive of its chief anathema.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Even—or especially—in his Parnassian (and often <span style="font-style:italic;">pompier</span>) hyperbole, Alomar unwittingly caricatures certain nineteenth-century tropes and affectations. <a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> What Norbert Bilbeny calls Alomar’s “republican radicalism,” and what Joan Ramon Resina dubs his “positivist libertarianism,” unfurls in a Whitmanesque blend of fiery defiance and quixotic utopianism.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> By whatever name we call it—aside from Futurism—some form of dynamic liberalism appeared to Alomar as an exciting political prospect. The very yoking of these binaries seemed, to Marinetti and his ilk, a ridiculous prospect by the end of the century’s first decade. It is precisely Alomar’s lingering ingenuousness that now spares his text any suspicion of bad faith.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps not surprisingly, the tension between Alomar’s aims and his somewhat outmoded stylistics invites the dismissal of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span> as revealing simply a “vaguely modernizing curiosity.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Even the great modernist, Catalan poet, J. V. Foix would later describe Alomar’s writing as politically adventurous, but “anachronistic” in a literary sense.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Still, to chalk up Alomar’s text as “insufficiently modern” is to forget what passed muster as modern at the turn of the century, to disavow the shifting conditions of modernity—and its modernist foils—as they took shape.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> As Resina notes, innovation and historicism were inextricably intertwined in modernist discourse at the turn of the century. Consider, in this vein, Nietzsche’s deliberations on history’s “Uses and Disadvantages” (which, not coincidentally, earned him Marinetti’s categorical dismissal as a crusty “Academic Professor,” the philosopher’s most radical blasphemies notwithstanding).<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>, for its part, is as elegiac as it is exhortative. Alomar never posits the future—and the rupture that will usher it in—as entirely divested of the forces that brought about its becoming. “Tradition,” he writes, “is a supremely powerful cultural element, since, as you well know, no man may boast of the complete invention of any idea or method.” As Daniel Cottom has recently argued, Marinetti’s embrace of a misanthropic, mechanized poetics of anti-individualism—which literalized and fetishized novelty as a technological revolution, a notion entirely absent from Alomar’s purview—often betrays a fundamentally anachronistic sensibility, quite in spite of his intentions.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Conversely, some of Alomar’s earliest expositors claimed to spy another affect beneath his ostensibly humanist <span style="font-style:italic;">logos</span>. “Alomar,” Marcel Robin declared in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure</span> review, “is better armed for negative criticism, for offensive combat rather than the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> investiture of some impossible peace in his chimerical city; an anarchist should occupy himself solely with destruction.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> According to Robin, Alomar’s rhetoric of synthesis, of collaborative construction, gives the lie to some fundamentally iconoclastic—even “anarchic”—tendencies. This seems more the projection of contemporary French anxieties than the discernment of any actual political predisposition on Alomar’s behalf. Alomar’s anarchic “rebellion” is a rhetorical one, marked more by chivalrous earnestness than any militant machinations. His language insists, again and again, upon the constructive benefits of meliorist cooperation, based upon “Poetic” intuition and liberal individualism. Still, while Robin seems slightly off the mark as to the core of Alomar’s sentiment, he rightly identifies at its heart a dialectical tendency, the nuances of which become flattened when compared to Marinettian bombast.
    </p>
<p>
      In this vein, Alomar’s writing resonates far less with the latter’s scorched-earth rhetoric, than it does with the Florentine Futurists’ more nuanced approach to the politics of historicism. The “secular religion of spiritualized nationalism”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> developed by Giovanni Papini and Ardengo Soffici—beginning around the same years as Alomar’s first Futurist pronouncements, and taking further shape in the journals <span style="font-style:italic;">La Voce</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lacerba</span>—is rehearsed in terms strikingly similar to Alomar’s.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Florentines actively distinguished their “new sensibility” from Marinetti’s “new technicality”; they differentiated their “disdain for the <span style="font-style:italic;">cult</span> of the past” from Marinetti’s “disdain for the past,” <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Just as Florentine Futurism pursued conflicting Italian and Tuscan interests, so too Alomar’s text must be considered in the cultural, ideological, and epistemological contexts out of which it developed and to which it contributed. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span> need not be held hostage—whether nominally or notionally, politically or poetically—to its disparities from <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> other iteration of “futurism.” Aside from its importance to the fitful developments of twentieth-century Catalan and Spanish culture, and its unclassifiable resistance to various categorical imperatives (whether <span style="font-style:italic;">modernisme</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">noucentisme</span>, or unreconstructed <span style="font-style:italic;">catalanisme</span>), the text merits further consideration as a tract on its own terms. It is hoped that the present rendering—the first substantial translation in English, to my knowledge—will at the very least afford Alomar’s writing more scholarly attention in the Anglo-American world.
    </p>
<p>
      The pyrotechnics that have accompanied the centenary of Italian Futurism have passed over Alomar with barely a sound. If we are to take him at his word, he would have preferred at least some earnest refutation to utter silence. “Oh, the supreme delight that our sons may contradict us!” reads one of the last lines of <span style="font-style:italic;">El Futurisme</span>. This invitation to the funeral of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span>, even as he pens its birth announcement, envies little of Marinetti’s summons for new generations to bury his movement in its turn. More than a hundred years on, however, Alomar’s self-effacing cadences ring with far more sincerity.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A note on the translation</h1>
<p>
	The translation is based upon Alomar’s 1905 text (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), written in Catalan, reprinted in Gabriel Alomar, <span style="font-style:italic;">Obres Completes de Gabriel Alomar, Volume II; El</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">futurisme: seguit del articles d’El poble català, 1904–1906</span> (Mallorca: Editorial Moll, 2000). I have chosen to omit from the present translation Alomar’s lengthy excursus on the question of Catalanism, as it deals more specifically (and at times ploddingly) with internal political economy at the expense of the text’s other, more evocative, and representative themes.

	Cited in Lily Litvak, “Alomar and Marinetti: Catalan and Italian Futurism,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Revue des Langues Vivantes</span> 38:6 , 586. As early as 1909, Marinetti peremptorily (and perhaps defensively) averred that the tag of Futurism had occurred to him “in a flash.” See the preface to Gian Pietro Lucini, <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolverate (con una Prefazione futurista di F. T. Marinetti)</span> (Milan: Poesia, 1909). He reiterated the originality of his invention in 1915, writing, “For a moment, I hesitated between the words ‘Dynamism’ and ‘Futurism.’ My Italian blood, however, surged the more strongly when my lips proclaimed aloud the freshly invented word ‘Futurism.’” Marinetti, <span style="font-style:italic;">Guerra sola igiene del mondo</span>, reprinted as “Futurism’s First Battles,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">F.

	A few notable studies—from Lily Litvak’s pioneering essay more than three decades ago, to a more recent reappraisal by David Bird—have done much to elucidate the affinities and divergences, both potential and practical, between Alomar’s essay and Marinetti’s numerous Futurist writings. Lily Litvak argues for the two Futurisms as bearing “identical foundations and aspirations” (Litvak, “Alomar and Marinetti,” 603). Giuseppe Sansone and, more recently, Andrew Anderson, have argued for their fundamental difference. For a summary of the polemic, see Anderson, “Futurism and Spanish Literature,” 153–54. I concur with Joan Ramon Resina’s assessment in “Observaciones sobre la vanguardia catalana” that, while we cannot exaggerate the affinities between the two authors’ texts, or even their world views, the insistence to the contrary often comes at “the expense of Alomar’s modernity.” Joan Ramon Resina, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">El aeroplano y la estrella: El movimiento de vanguardia en los Países Catalanes, 1904–1936</span> (Amsterdam and Atlanta, GA: Rodopi, 1997), 18. David Bird’s recent essay scrupulously differentiates between the two authors, but admirably refuses, in doing so, to let Alomar’s Futurism to be “critically subordinated to Marinetti’s Italian one.” In other words, Bird seeks to reverse the prevalent iteration of Marinetti’s “Futurism” as the originary or paradigmatic one.

	In this regard, the congruence of Alomar’s writing to other European avant-gardists of the period seems as important as his potential anticipation of—or difference from—Marinetti. Writing during the very same years from Paris, the expatriate Italian, Ricciotto Canudo, describes a <span style="font-style:italic;">Homo Novus</span>, and repeatedly insists upon artistic “synthesis” as the only way forward: a gathering of all expression into the “Temple” of “universality.” Both Canudo and Alomar reveal the same millennial optimism, verging on the chronically vague, rendered in a new-age language in which grand concepts—Poetry, Music, Spirit—are capitalized and consecrated as the new (old) crux of society, both Mediterranean and modern.

Merjian, “A Screen for Projection: Ricciotto Canudo’s Exponential Aesthetics and the Parisian Avant-Gardes,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">European Film Theory</span>, Temenuga Trifonova, ed.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  This article draws on unpublished archival material to illuminate Gertrude Stein’s visits to Chicago during the 1930s. Stein caused a sensation all over the city--especially among the city’s literary ladies--but also met with resistance at the University of Chicago. Stein’s time in Chicago reveals the complex relationship among gender, literary celebrity, and the reception of literary modernism, as well as the ways in which an avant-garde lesbian writer becomes a “great” writer in a tradition that is dominated by men. Most importantly, Stein’s reception in Chicago is central to understanding new arguments not only about Stein’s identity but also about Stein’s aesthetic, which was significantly impacted by her experiences in a city characterized by its “middle”-ness and mobility.

<p>
	When <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> was published in 1933, Gertrude Stein became a literary celebrity. Her friend the photographer and novelist Carl Van Vechten told her that she was “on every tongue like Greta Garbo.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Stein and Alice B. Toklas found that Stein’s name lit up New York City marquees when they arrived in America for Stein’s 1934–1935 lecture tour; while across the country, in every town and city, she was greeted by crowds.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In Chicago, however, Stein’s reception was marked by initial difficulties. “Everywhere else it had all been easy but here [in Chicago] the trouble began,” Stein explains in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> . “For the first time they were making arrangements that did not please me and I was beginning to say so.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Stein had friends in Chicago and a wide readership eager for her visit—she had not been back to the United States since she left for France in 1903—but the University of Chicago (unlike other institutions) was at first resistant to her, causing much confusion about when and where and to whom Stein would lecture. Stein wanted her first lecture at the university to be the English department’s annual William Vaughn Moody lecture, named after a professor who had taught Stein at Radcliffe before coming to Chicago.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> But the selection committee hedged and eventually chose the popular but less experimental poet Edna St. Vincent Millay instead.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> There were also problems with finding a suitable lecture hall, with limiting the audience to 500 students or fewer (a request that Stein made for all of her American lectures), with overbooking, and with charging students an admission fee.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein thus cancelled her lectures there. Two of Stein’s friends who had been organizing Stein’s other engagements around the city—<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> writer Fanny Butcher and Bobsy Goodspeed, a prominent society re—stepped in to straighten out affairs. Finally, “Poetry and Grammar,” sponsored by the English department, was delivered at the International House on November 28, 1934 and “Pictures” the following week, sponsored by the Renaissance Society, an international organization promoting contemporary art on campus although not affiliated with the university.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Stein delivered both lectures to packed audiences.
      </p>
<p>
	Without such organizational difficulties, Stein spoke all over the city to many nonacademic audiences that were excited to see and hear her. She drew huge crowds at her December book signing at Marshall Fields department store. In her diary, Fanny Butcher describes how the store was “so jammed that they wouldn’t even let us off the third floor . . . . we nearly lost our lives getting to [Stein and Toklas].”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Butcher chronicled every step of Stein’s visits for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, the city’s most widely read paper at the time with a daily circulation of over seven hundred thousand readers and a Sunday circulation of over one million.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> She later wrote about Stein in her memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">Many Lives—One Love</span> . (Butcher’s “one love” is books.) My title comes from this memoir in which Butcher describes the sensation that Stein caused in Chicago but also the resistance Stein felt from the University of Chicago. Presumably, Stein is the “invincible force” and the University of Chicago is the “immoveable object,” though the ambiguity proves potent in my argument about how Stein’s personality is both an agent and also an absence in the critical reception of her work (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 419). This short but important story in the history of literary modernism, which I bring to light through unpublished archival material, raises questions about the performance of being a writer—in particular, a writer whose work the public does not wholly understand. It is also a story that reveals the complex relationship among gender, literary celebrity, and the reception of literary modernism, as well as the ways in which an avant-garde lesbian writer becomes a “great” writer in a tradition that is dominated by men, especially within the university. Along these lines, and most importantly, Stein’s 1930s Chicago visits illuminate a tension between the avant-garde and the institutional, between Stein’s radical experiments with language and the University of Chicago’s curriculum of “Great Books,” which was being launched in the 1930s by university president Robert Hutchins and his newly hired philosophy of law professor, Mortimer Adler.
      </p>
<p>
	Chicago was a city of mobility and middleness, and Stein projected these qualities in her time there. Stein did not have an exclusive group of readers in Chicago, as I will discuss in the first section below in context of Stein’s popular appeal. Rather, she found herself performing for and moving among various communities, including huge public audiences, an intimate group of literary ladies, and a university crowd. Indeed, once the University of Chicago experienced the success of Stein’s first visit to campus, President Robert Hutchins asked Stein if she would return later in her tour to deliver another set of lectures. Stein accepted, and in February 1935 she and Toklas stayed for over two weeks in Thornton Wilder’s Hyde Park apartment while Stein met with students and wrote and delivered lectures specifically for the University of Chicago audience. The  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> University of Chicago Press eventually published these lectures as <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span>.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Stein later wrote to Wilder: “I love Chicago and I guess I liked the two weeks there in your apartment and with all your family the best of everything, and I think I tell everybody so so much so that Alice tells me not to because it is not polite to the others but it is true and we did have a most awfully good time there” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 24). Chicago was the American city that Stein and Toklas preferred above all the others, and they returned to it four times on their tour (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 333–51).
      </p>
<p>
	Chicago’s distinctive qualities are numerous—especially during the 1930s when fresh capital, new immigrants, world-renowned architecture, jazz, and a rising cultural class vitalized the city—but perhaps the most obvious fact about Chicago is that it is a very big city in the middle of the country. During the 1930s most travelers between the coasts would pass through Chicago on the Century Limited or the Commodore Vanderbilt trains and often stay in the city for several nights; more lines of track fanned out from Chicago in all directions than in any other American city.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Chicago’s “geography,” a word that Stein uses in several of her titles, is an important concept for Stein, and crucial to understanding why she loved the city both literally and aesthetically. Geography signifies not only physical location but also the spatial arrangement of words on a page. In her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures at the University of Chicago, which I will discuss at more length below, Stein vaunted the mobility of American people and how they forced the American language to have “a different feeling of moving” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). “Moving” language, according to Stein, rejects classical narrative structure, rejects a “beginning and a middle and an ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Stein suggests that American writing poses a challenge to an Aristotelian concept of a work’s coherence. American language—like the city of Chicago—was language that expanded out in all directions, spatially unbound. And Stein’s geography of middleness and mobility was also part of her persona: Stein was a re who navigated the middle of things, who moved freely among different circles. As a long-time resident of France who was yet an American, a society lady who yet appeared manly, a Radcliffe-educated woman who was distanced from university culture, and a very famous writer whose major works were mostly unknown, Stein’s affiliations were inside and out.
      </p>
<p>
	Consequently Stein is a re upon whom many groups have laid a claim, from the French Dadaists of the 1920s and the visual artists she befriended, to the writers of the “Lost Generation,” scholars of feminism, Jewishness, and gender studies, and practitioners of language poetry, to name a few. Stein’s Chicago reception is central to an account of her fluctuating status and to understanding new arguments not only about Stein’s identity but also about Stein’s aesthetic. Critics of Stein’s work disagree in particular about how to understand its specific kind of difficulty. Powerful arguments have been made recently that suggest two very different approaches, and an examination of Stein’s time in Chicago illuminates the historical and sociological roots that lie beneath this theoretical divide. On the one hand, critics who champion language poetry argue that Stein wants textual interpretation to be governed individually by each reader; namely, meaning is localized by the experience of an “autonomous” reader every time the text is read, and thus a reader’s personality—and a reader’s sense of an author behind  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the text—can be very much a part of a text’s meaning. On the other hand, critics argue that Stein’s texts are themselves autonomous, that Stein’s commitment is to putting forth impersonal ideas apart from the reader or Stein herself.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> To look at how Stein herself advanced her work is to see how she created these two very different models: how she promoted pleasure and personality among a mainstream reading public, and how she promoted ideas and impersonality among a university crowd. Essentially Stein sought fame—which meant a positive, widespread response from all kinds of readers, across lines that demarcated class, gender, and geography. This fact explains why she welcomed varied responses to her work, and it also underpins our critical conception of her texts as oriented to each reader’s idiosyncratic experiences of them. But Stein also wanted her works to stand on their own, to have ideas in them that would make them great, and this fact upholds readings of Stein’s writing that emphasize its impersonality. Stein wanted it both ways.
      </p>
<p>
	The story of Stein’s visits to Chicago also expands our conception of what it means to “understand” Stein’s modernist aesthetic, which was characterized by humor, self-reflexivity, sexual punning, and musicality that immediately appealed to many readers even as they were outspoken about not “getting it.” Stein gave tips about how to read her work and she did not disparage those who might be called “middlebrow,” as another famous modernist, Virginia Woolf, used the term.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Stein explained to a reporter in 1935, “I like ordinary people who don’t bore me. Highbrows do, you know, always do.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> As recent studies have shown, many modernist writers challenged the equation between high modernism and elitism; Stein, too, broadly advertised her writing and was read widely across cultural and class lines.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the 1930s, popular periodicals— especially daily newspapers—were attuned to new writers like Stein more than ever before.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Stein was read differently, however, than the work of other modernist writers. During Stein’s lifetime the reception of her work—especially among the educated but academically unaffiliated—was characterized by pleasurable sensation and interpretative openness. Rather than trying to locate the essential meaning behind Stein’s texts, many of Stein’s readers were encouraged to hear it, sense it, and laugh at it without feeling that they understood it. The incomprehensibility of Stein’s work actually had the effect of promoting simple sensory pleasure. In her explanations about how to understand her work, as I will show, Stein raised the larger issue of how to understand <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> literary text, as if complete mastery could ever be achieved. These points should make us question the ways that Stein has been read as a modernist re akin to other modernists who had moments of fame despite the fact (or because of the fact) that their works are also notoriously difficult. Stein’s difficulty is not the same, and she publicized her personality—that is, herself—as naturally as she publicized her writings. Furthermore, Stein may be the mother of the avant-garde, but she was never so ahead of her times as to obscure, to her mind, the primary aim of a literary text—which is immediate, effortless pleasure.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	    Stein and Toklas mostly traveled by train throughout their 1934–35 lecture tour, but soon after arriving in America they took a last-minute flight to Chicago for the city’s premiere of Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints In Three Acts.</span> This marked the first time that they would see the opera performed, which Stein had written with Virgil Thomson. The flight to Chicago was also their first experience on an airplane. They loved it: the view of America from above, Stein writes, “made any one know why the post-cubist painting was what it was” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 197). When she looked down on America, she saw many places all at once, a geographical composition below her that she compared to modernist art, and which inspired her own aesthetic. Her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures describe the kind of language that corresponds to this geography of many places: “moving” language going in all directions. Flying to Chicago not only clarified, for Stein, the origins and direction of modernist art but also her understanding of who was receptive to it. It was the literary ladies of Chicago—Fanny Butcher and Bobsy Goodspeed among others who I will describe below—who greeted Stein and Toklas when they stepped foot off the plane. These women were eager for art and culture from back East but especially from abroad, and they enthusiastically embraced “La Stein,” as Butcher called her. In contrast, Stein did not have an advocate at the University of Chicago until Goodspeed introduced her to Thornton Wilder on Stein’s second trip to Chicago. Wilder was also very famous at the time, having won his first Pulitzer in 1928 for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</span>. Partly because of his success, Wilder was offered a special lectureship at the University of Chicago by its president, Robert Hutchins, who had been Wilder’s classmate at Oberlin and Yale. Indeed, even within an academic setting, the famous writer-in-residence—an offensive new position from the point of view of the professors—first welcomed Stein.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> She secured a popular audience much before she was established as a major modernist writer within the academy.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Longtime literary editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Fanny Butcher was someone who could navigate among the various groups of readers in Chicago, and she is key to my argument about Stein’s popular reception. Butcher came from very little money but she nonetheless made her way to the University of Chicago—commuting to campus at first though her mother complained that she was not “working gainfully” she was “just pleasuring [her]self” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 26). Butcher graduated in 1910 and soon began her career in journalism. She also opened and managed a bookshop in Chicago, Fanny Butcher Books, from 1919 to 1927, a job that combined pleasure with gain, and which kept her attuned to the market appeal of certain books (or lack thereof). Butcher befriended many of the most famous American writers of the time—including Sinclair Lewis, Edna Ferber, H. L. Mencken, Ernest Hemingway, and Willa Cather. Her cultural clout came also from her visits to Europe, where she met George Bernard Shaw,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> James Joyce, and in 1931, Gertrude Stein (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 416–19). Butcher’s readers could rely on her to introduce new books in a bright and straightforward manner. Butcher was a Midwesterner (she was born in Kansas and spent almost all of her life in Chicago), and her literary sensibility was both ambitious and consciously common sense. For example, consider a passage from a column (written months before Stein’s first visit) describing Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      You, as reader, have something of the feeling of a rock against which the sea of her words beats constantly, in rhythm, in flow and ebb . . . and although she writes more of ideas than she does of the actual doings of her characters, when you have finished “The Making of Americans” you know all the members of the Hersland family better than you have known any human beings you have met in literature.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Butcher here celebrates the reading experience as both purely sensory—the reader’s “feeling” is vital to the book’s meaning—and purely intellectual—this is writing of “ideas.” These modes dominate (and often polarize) Stein’s readers, but to Butcher they pose no conflict. Foreshadowing another famous review of Stein’s work—by John Ashbery, about which I will say more in my conclusion—Butcher offers her readers access to a very difficult work by emphasizing a reader’s centrality as well as the text’s essential intellectual greatness.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Like Butcher, Elizabeth Fuller Goodspeed—known as “Bobsy”—was a cultural arbiter in the city. Goodspeed had studied in Paris, and from 1932–1940 she was president of the Arts Club. This important gallery, where Goodspeed invited Stein to speak, introduced Picasso, Duchamp, Brâncuşi, Legér, and many other artists early on to Chicago. (Goodspeed’s husband, Charles “Barney” Goodspeed, was also a public re in Chicago; he was a Republican Party leader and a trustee of the University of Chicago [<span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 10].) A few other Chicago women played a role in Stein’s visits, including Alice Roullier, a gallery owner who organized the Arts Club exhibits, who was half-French, and who had traveled with Butcher to France and first met Stein and Toklas there, and Maude Hutchins, the wife of the University of Chicago president. Adopting Stein’s terminology, one could say that it was a group of American “wives” who first became enamored of Stein. Stein made a clear distinction between husbands and wives, describing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> how Alice sat with “the wives of geniuses” and she conversed with the geniuses themselves, the men.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> But in Chicago, gender played out differently: it was the wives who positively adored her. Stein would later voice conflicted feelings about the ways in which widespread fame, which now included this feminized readership, both overshadowed her work and inhibited her usual flow of writing. However, at the time of her tour, as she recounts it, she fully enjoyed the attention she received from the nationwide press—it had been a long time coming—and in particular from this group of Chicago women.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Stein’s presence also seemed to encourage more than usual intimacy and playfulness among these women, especially as they performed in front of the camera (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> and <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>). In photographs from a dinner party at the Lincoln Park apartment of Bobsy and Barney Goodspeed, where Stein and Toklas stayed for several nights, the women are  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">crowded together on a sofa, framed by men, as they pass around a flower that duplicates the flower in the Bernard Boutet de Monvel portrait of Bobsy Goodspeed above them. The large, free-standing film lamps in the photograph were set up for the short film that Bobsy Goodspeed made of the party, in which the women are visibly laughing. The Goodspeed home, designed by David Adler, housed paintings by Picasso, Calder, Matisse, and another portrait of Bobsy by the American impressionist Martha Walter. <a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Goodspeed wears a dress that resembles the one she wears in the portrait, and she flirts with the flower held to the nose of Richard Bokum, Fanny Butcher’s future husband. The self-awareness evident in these photographs—the play with surface representation and identity—tapped into Stein’s own aesthetic, as if the women have picked up on the indirect charm of a writer who constructs an autobiography from the point of view of her lover. The photographs also reveal the associative force between Stein herself—who sits on the sofa—and the aesthetic of her work, as mimicked by Bobsy Goodspeed.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Stein’s more experimental writing—like her long poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> —was similarly attentive to visual compositions in its playful, punning, and yet serious fashion. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> (which was published during Stein’s lifetime and thus available to Chicago readers) contributes to a larger modernist movement clearly embraced by Bobsy Goodspeed in the design of her home. Through a combination of sexual tropes, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> concludes:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The care with which the rain is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    This passage might function as a descriptive tag to a home filled with modernist art, in the sense that the colors and subjects of this art may be technically “wrong” and yet the art is composed with emphatic “care.” Modernist art aims not for verisimilitude but a fidelity or “justice” to what is represented, which is a different kind of “likeness.” The interior, feminized spaces suggested by <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span>, like the Goodspeed home, are spaces of domestic comfort and freedom, where there is “a chair and plenty of breathing.” Both realms—literal and poetic—toy with the energies of men: in the photograph, the men are on the fringes; and in the poem, the power of the phallic asparagus and fountain is created and—with humorous juxtaposition—subverted.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In fact there is some speculation that these women were open to exploring lesbianism, a point that emphasizes continuity from Stein’s contemporary readership through her promotion within fields of gender and sexuality studies today. In a letter that Stein’s friend Bernard Faÿ wrote to her in 1934 to encourage Stein to visit America, he describes Bobsy Goodspeed as “the lover of the wife of the president [of the University of Chicago].”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> That unnamed wife would be Maude Hutchins (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>), whose beauty was legendary and whose turbulent marriage of twenty-seven years ended in public catastrophe when Robert Hutchins left her in 1948 for his much younger secretary. Maude Hutchins then became a writer of sexually provocative novels, many of which dallied in lesbian fantasy.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Although there is no evidence other than Faÿ’s letter that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Maude Hutchins and Bobsy Goodspeed were lovers, it is fair to say that Stein and Toklas met a particularly receptive group of women in Chicago, who seemed very much attracted to Stein’s gender drag and her performative humor. Consider for example Stein’s inscription in a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lucy Church Amiably,</span> gifted to Bobsy Goodspeed: “For Bobsy, Lucy Church Amiably is amiable but Bobsy is so sweet and kind and we we like that kind of yes we do like that kind.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Or Stein’s inscription in a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> presented to Richard Bokum after he and Fanny Butcher, married: “For Dick not bunkum but Kokum for Dick Fanny’s Dick.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Who knows whether Goodspeed, Butcher, and Bokum understood the double entendre of Stein’s “kind” but they certainly would have known the coarse meaning of “dick.” These inscriptions and others amused Bobsy Goodspeed to such an extent that she collected them in a small private press book that she had printed for Christmas presents in 1934, and which Stein also sent as gifts, sometimes even inscribing her book of inscriptions<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). “Steinish,” as the papers called it, was a compelling language for the Goodspeeds’ group of Chicago socialites. Tantalizing with repetition, Stein had a way of saying and not saying it.

	    Apart from inscriptions, the playful repetitions in Stein’s writing were not perfectly clear to all of her readers in this cultural milieu. Fanny Butcher knew that most of Stein’s books were not suited to the marketplace, and she admitted in her diary to not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> understanding Stein’s more experimental language. The confusion that Butcher felt in regard to Stein’s work is worth looking at in detail, since Butcher’s response suggests two things: that the difficulty of Stein’s writing is different from other kinds of modernist difficulty, and that readers often respond to Stein’s work like they respond to Stein herself. Butcher at first treated Stein’s work as if she needed to decode its meaning but as she encountered more of Stein’s writing, and Stein in person, Butcher shifted her approach, enjoying on her own terms Stein’s work without needing to master it. This shift certainly has something to do with Butcher’s early aspirations as a student and her eventual authority as a literary critic and editor. But Butcher’s response also mirrors the responses of many readers who sensed that Stein’s work posed a subversive challenge to the very experience of understanding itself or to models of reading institutionalized by the university.

<p>
	    Butcher was someone both trained by the University of Chicago and also attuned to a wider culture of <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> readers: her response to Stein clarifies different modes of reading Stein’s work. Butcher read Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> when she was a sophomore at the University of Chicago but she did not read it for a course—Stein’s work was not then taught in literature courses there. Butcher was given <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> by a mentor whom she met at a Thursday evening salon hosted by a Viennese woman in Chicago (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 413–15). Butcher described the reading experience much later in her autobiography: “I couldn’t understand it, but neither did I understand Estonian, and I  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> felt that, if I could just learn the rudiments, I would have no trouble with the alien Stein tongue” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 416). This admission emphasizes both Butcher’s ambition and her desire to cultivate an appreciation for legitimate avant-garde art emerging from Europe. Stein’s language, however, is not compared to French or Italian or Latin; it is like “Estonian,” that is, outside of Butcher’s familiar linguistic terrain but accessible if she can simply “learn the rudiments.” It is writing with future potential. With the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, Stein made her writing more accessible to readers like Butcher; she exposed herself to what might be called “middlebrow” taste in the sense that the term frequently connotes an appeal to an aspiring class, especially a feminized, consumerist readership, or is pejoratively applied to works that are “accessible versions of avant-garde experiments.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Butcher’s position on Stein’s writing may reflect an enthusiasm for a style that she was beginning to understand, that she felt she <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> understand. Alternatively, her response may also indicate that she knows something unusual is at work in Stein’s texts—some quality that her University of Chicago education did not train her to recognize, the “moving” language of interpretive openness. Standing outside of the academy, in the case of reading Stein’s work, might actually aid her enjoyment of Stein’s “foreign” prose.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Many modernist texts require readers to decipher, translate, and connect elements to make meaning—to treat the text impersonally and analytically. Take, for instance, T. S. Eliot, who was becoming a literary authority whose work was lionized in the academy at the same time that an academic readership was resisting Stein. His work is exemplary both because of its allusiveness—impersonality thus defined as the submersion of self in quotations, fragments, and masks<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a>—and because of Eliot’s own claim in “Tradition and the Individual Talent”  advocating the impersonality of the artist. “The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality,” Eliot writes, suggesting that critics should not aim to find the artist or the artist’s “emotions” within a literary work. “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion,” Eliot writes, “but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The impersonality promoted by Eliot and carried forth as a major modernist tenet considers literature as a kind of science in which complex emotions are concentrated through language into something that is not an emotion at all. Contradictory in essence, as Sharon Cameron has recently argued, the concept of impersonality yet depends upon persons; it is not personality’s opposite. Rather, impersonality— “as a practice, as an ethic, as a representation,” in Cameron’s words—is “a penetration through or a falling outside of the boundary of the human particular.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> That is, to advocate impersonality—or to treat a text impersonally—is to see it as detached from <span style="font-style:italic;">particular</span> individuals. To recognize a text’s impersonality is to understand that the experiences it represents extend beyond the historical limits of a particular individual—the author’s or the reader’s.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Though Stein’s texts have been read as impersonal, they also have long been read in ways that privilege the experiences of Stein and her readers over anything else the work might impart. The reactions that Stein’s writing elicited are closely tied to readers’ reactions to Gertrude Stein herself, to how they read her as a particular person. And  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein’s writing is difficult partly because as a person she was difficult to read. Remarkably, however, confusion with Stein’s work did not necessarily limit a reader’s pleasure, an enjoyment that came from being quite pleasantly disoriented by it, and by Stein herself. Over twenty years after first reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> but before she wrote lavish praise for Stein in her pieces for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Butcher privately described meeting Stein at her country house in France in 1931 and confessed to not “getting” everything that Stein said. “There lives with [Stein] a strange, over-feminine woman whose name is, I think Alice Toutless,” Butcher writes in her diary, “She attends to the household affairs and serves the plates at table, and coquettes with the guests and quotes Gertrude Stein’s best mots to Gertrude Stein and the guests.” Butcher then describes Stein reading aloud from her own work: “I suppose I looked a little vague,” Butcher admits, “because she read it again and said ‘Do you get it?’ I didn’t, but I said I did because I hadn’t guts enough to ask her to <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> me get it.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Butcher conflates Stein’s domestic partnership with Toklas with Stein’s writing: both, to her, are strange. It would seem that Butcher might at this point abandon Stein’s work—not having understood it in college or later in Stein’s presence—but what happens instead is that Butcher finds a way of appreciating Stein’s writing without “getting” it and without fully “getting” Stein. Indeed, the aggressiveness of Stein’s question to Butcher (“Do you get it?”) is contrary to Stein’s more typical indirectness (both in writing and in conversation), as if Stein really asks the question to her American visitor with the full knowledge that her writing cannot be “got.” The more that Butcher reads of Stein’s work and consorts with Stein herself, the more she allows for the idea that “something of the feeling”—as she writes later in her review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>—can dominate the reading experience.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The Chicago newspapers—especially the society pages—are full of responses to Stein similar to Butcher’s. Many people frankly admitted to not understanding Stein while nonetheless enjoying what she had to say. Judith Cass of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> describes “Miss Stein” as someone “whom all . . . have met . . . like and admire but whose writing no one I know even pretends to understand.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Another <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writer describes the effect that Stein and Toklas had on the crowd at the Chicago premiere of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints In Three Acts</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      Perhaps never before . . . was there so little attention paid to the lovely ladies in the boxes, for short-haired, simply gowned Gertrude Stein was the center of attention. Her longsleeved, high-necked gown of a dark plum color completely overshadowed the colorful and gorgeous gowns of her feminine neighbors, although the huge pendant gold earrings of Miss Toklas did cause many to glance her way.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Even as Toklas often appears in the papers as Stein’s “friend and secretary”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> or inaccurately in Butcher’s memoir as Stein’s “childhood friend” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 411), there is clearly a way that Chicago understands Stein through a reading of her sartorial manliness. She is distinctly not “feminine” with her “short hair” and “high-necked gown,” a description that functions as a surface sign of her sexual difference. But Stein’s sexuality is comprehended in a way that is never made explicit, expressed as a “feeling” about  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> things rather than something definite. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writer here knows that something meaningful is happening in Stein’s presence but she is unable to state exactly <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> it means: is Stein simple (“simply gowned”) or is she complex (“a dark plum color”)? The description of Stein at the opera is also a description of Stein’s very prose: pleasure is found in it even as it is not clear what is signified by Stein’s reversals and visual play.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Bennett Cerf, Stein’s editor at Random House, knew that the American public needed a primer on how to read most of Stein’s texts and he encouraged her immediately on arriving in America to appear on Pathé Newsreels, a program shown in movie theaters across the country. For this short publicity film, Stein gave an overview of the lectures she would give, suggesting that her listeners would understand her if they allowed themselves simply to enjoy the experience. “My lectures are to be a simple way to say that if you understand a thing you enjoy it and if you enjoy a thing you understand it,” she says in the film. And then again, she states, “Understanding and enjoying is the same thing.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Stein’s use of gerunds suggests that comprehension of her texts is not fixed, but moves with potential like the very American language she celebrates. Associating enjoying with understanding—as unfixed and unstable—becomes a recurrent theme; in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> , the work that Stein wrote after her lecture tour in which she grapples with her new celebrity status, Stein writes:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      They ask me to tell why an author like myself can become popular. It is very easy everybody keeps saying and writing what anybody feels that they are understanding and so they get tired of that, anybody can get tired of anything everybody can get tired of something and so they do not know it but they get tired of feeling they are understanding and so they take pleasure in having something that they feel they are not understanding 
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 126).
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Stein suggests that readers are tired of having literary texts explained to them, perhaps tired of having to approach literary difficulty in an analytical fashion. Readers want to forego the work of understanding Stein’s texts in favor of sensation, the feeling of Stein’s rich word associations rather than an analysis of what the text “means,” as if meaning could be pinned down as a static quality.
	    </p>
<p>
	      This approach to reading Stein’s work is exemplified by recent critics who uphold the centrality of a reader’s experience of Stein’s distinctive language, and by practitioners of language poetry who see Stein as an important model. For instance, Juliana Spahr—both critic and poet—argues that Stein’s “polylingual grammars” shift the emphasis of reading away from a “single inherent meaning” instead allowing a reader “multiple strategies of response”: “Stein’s works allow a decentralized self-governance and autonomy on the part of the reader by giving the reading act as much authority as the authoring act.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Though it is unclear whether Stein ever would have wanted her own presence as author to disappear—a point to which I will return—her statements above about how to understand her work suggest that she was open to various readings apart from finding neat or right or even clearly articulated responses to it. Stein here welcomes personality, both hers and her readers, as a governing force in the interpretation of her work.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      What differentiates the wider public’s response to Stein from the academic community’s response, which I discuss next, is a readiness to accept pleasure without textual understanding—or rather, to accept Stein’s suggestion that this pleasure is its own understanding. The difficulty of Stein’s work did not necessarily demand that readers decipher its meaning but rather it allowed them to simply enjoy it as a sensation, and this held true for the lectures that she gave in Chicago. For many of her listeners—whether they could be called the cultural elite or the middlebrow—it was Stein’s humor and music that emerged from her difficult use of repetition, disconnected syntax, and nonstandard grammar. Furthermore, though the style of Stein’s American lectures is innovative and arresting, like a dress of “dark plum,” the arguments themselves are “simply-gowned”; they are not particularly complicated. For instance, in her lecture “What Is English Literature” (which she gave at the Arts Club), Stein claims that that glory of English literature comes from the fact that England for hundreds of years had the stability and wealth to sustain writers and a reading public. She traces a trajectory from Chaucer to the twentieth century by way of the continuous “daily island life” that characterizes the greatness of the country’s literature. She does not advance a theory of literature here that explicitly challenges conventional thinking. Moreover, Stein’s argument is kept in broad terms. Stein does not flaunt her erudition or burden her audience by making them feel as if she is teaching them something. She teaches them what they already know. Stein’s lectures appealed to an American public who wanted access to a famous writer at the center of the modernist movement in Paris but who would provide for them recognizable ways of thinking about writing and art. Stein amused the women who organized her visits and indulged her huge auditorium audiences: she was what the middle of America wanted an avant-garde artist to be.

<p>
		  Stein wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures for the University of Chicago while she and Toklas stayed in Thornton Wilder’s Hyde Park apartment on their third and longest stay in Chicago. The women circled back to Chicago on their tour—it was their hub—and the centrality and energy of the city deeply influenced the four lectures. Though the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures expand on the themes of the lectures that Stein gave earlier and elsewhere (published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures in America</span>) they are different in that Stein registers her sense of change in American culture as she was seeing it after thirty years away. Stein emphasizes the vitality of the American idiom as she read and heard it in advertisements, newspapers, road signs, slang, and local conversations. Her sense of fresh, compelling, modern language is not solely tied to “What is English Literature,” as she titled her earlier lecture, or is it even tied to literature at all. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> demonstrate a shift in Stein’s thinking about writing, especially, as I will argue, about the audience for it and the value of her writing over time. At the University of Chicago Stein confronted men with very strict claims about literary greatness, and her conflict with them reveals that she wanted her works to be read not just for their “feeling,” which would allow personality to govern literary interpretation. She also wanted them to be impersonal, to contain ideas that stood on their own and stood the test of time, but not ideas as defined in academic terms. Soon after her American tour in a 1935 lecture titled “What are Master-Pieces and Why are There so Few of Them” Stein goes so far as to claim that a masterpiece exists outside of a reader’s particular experience of it.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The reasons for Stein’s reconsideration of the role of reading emerge in looking at the criticism that some of Stein’s contemporaries voiced about her work and the history of her debate with them. Though the University of Chicago serves as a sharp counterpoint to Stein’s popular reception, and refined her judgment of what was exciting about American writing, ultimately Stein did not wholly reject the university’s approach to literature and they did not reject her. English department faculty voiced ambivalence about her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures even as they decided to publish them; and Stein disagreed with the men of Great Books even as she latched on to their idea of greatness and transformed it with her difference.
		</p>
<p>
		  Unlike her literary model Henry James who on returning to America in 1904 after twenty years abroad was appalled by the “alien” influences eroding the English language, Stein found that the mobility and lack of convention in American life (the lack of a “daily island life”) fostered the most dynamic developments in twentieth-century art and literature.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> She emphasizes in her first <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture “how the pressure of the non daily life living of the American nation has forced the words to have a different feeling of moving” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). Her description of American English is also an advertisement for her own, which is to say that her readers might experience her language as a kind of pleasant sensation, a “feeling of moving.” Stein suggests that American English is naturally less tied to tradition, and she connects her own purposefully nonstandard English with the innovative spirit of her home country that she was re-encountering with such pleasure on her tour. And in her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture, Stein’s emphasis on the movement of American writing takes the form of rejecting classical narrative structure, that is, “a beginning and a middle and an ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Whereas Aristotle argues that the construction of plot—by means of a beginning, middle, and end—is the most important feature of tragedy, Stein challenges the representation of time as indicated by a natural order of cause and effect. Stein is more interested in a constant middle—in the sense that the middle points in directions before and after—than she is in beginnings and endings, which are fixed in time, and signal a work’s wholeness and completion. Stein celebrates the dynamic openness of the most important experiences that writing should register, which “exist” rather than “happen”—for example, “Love” is the example she gives in her third lecture (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 38–39). Her aesthetic essentially embodies the very qualities that she witnesses in Chicago, that is, constant movement, shifts in direction, a sense of all things as present, open, and possible.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		  The University of Chicago Press and the university’s English department were not impressed by Stein’s creation of a language that has “a different feeling of moving” or by her lectures in particular. Thornton Wilder convinced the University of Chicago Press to publish Stein’s lectures in 1935—<span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> was the only work of hers that they published—but faculty who read the manuscript beforehand for the press were not supportive of the project. Professor Robert Lovett from the English department writes in his report: “Briefly, I do not agree with my colleague’s, Mr. Thornton Wilder’s, appreciation of these utterances. I think, however, that they may be properly published as part of literary history. Gertrude Stein is a fact, as Dadaism is a fact, and records of both ought to be preserved.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Lovett’s use of the word “utterances” suggests that he is unable to separate Stein’s writing from Stein’s performance: he reads text and person as one, as did Fanny Butcher and other <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writers. Another English department professor, Edith Foster Flint, writes that although she enjoyed Stein’s lectures when she first heard them, the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> left her with “a feeling of extreme irritation.” “I can see no virtue whatever in the manner of expression,” Flint writes, “And the ideas conveyed—so far as I am able to penetrate to them—do not seem to me so profound or novel as to necessitate, or warrant, the creation of a new medium, to me a grotesque medium.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Flint—like crowds of Chicagoans—found enjoyment in Stein’s performance but not in a more analytical reading of Stein’s texts, a reading framed by the values of an English department composed almost entirely of men.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Lovett’s and Flint’s strong responses highlight a moment when the categories that define Stein’s literary reception—between elite, middlebrow, and institutional, between women and men, between popularity and obscurity—explicitly break down. Moreover, the readers most resistant to Stein’s work were paradoxically also the ones who, in the end, were as invested as Stein in the concept of literary value.
		</p>
<p>
		  The re in whom all of these objections to Stein found their greatest force was Mortimer Adler, who had come to Chicago from Columbia University in order to establish a Great Books program (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). Like Wilder, Adler had been hand picked by Robert Hutchins in his first year as president. Hutchins wanted Adler to help him reform the undergraduate curriculum. But unlike Wilder—who was very popular at least with students—Adler was not well loved at the university, and like Stein, he was somewhat of an outsider to it.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Many faculty members were opposed to Great Books, preferring instead the implementation of what was called “The New Plan,” a two-year curriculum culminating in comprehensive exams across four fields: biological sciences, physical sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Students then went on to specialize in a particular field.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> But Hutchins—who team-taught Great Books with Adler—became even more convinced that Great Books was something that undergraduate curriculum should include because it favored classical training over more recent developments in the arts and sciences. Hutchins’s polemical 1933 convocation speech decried the emphasis put upon specialization: “The gadgeteers and the data-collectors, masquerading as scientists,” Hutchins said, “have threatened to become the supreme chieftains of the scholarly world.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> When Stein visited the University of Chicago, the debate over liberal arts education versus specialization was still very hot—it was a debate stemming  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> out all over the country—and she hit a nerve when she questioned Adler and Hutchins about their undergraduate program.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>
		  One infamous evening during a dinner party at Robert and Maude Hutchins’s home, Stein got into a very heated discussion with Adler and Robert Hutchins. The party took place on November 27, 1934—before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures—during Stein’s second visit to Chicago (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 342). According to Adler, Stein was “infuriated” by the idea that Great Books were read in translation; “She said that great literature was essentially untranslatable.” Adler describes how he and Hutchins “tried to argue with her, pointing out that we were concerned mainly with the ideas which were to be found in the Great Books. She might be right, we admitted, that fine writing suffers in translation, but ideas somehow transcended the particular language in which they were first expressed.” Apparently Hutchins elaborated, explaining that “the idea of justice” is the “same idea whether it is discussed by Plato in Greek, by Cicero in Latin, by Kant in German, or by John Stuart Mill in English.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Stein remained unconvinced, which prompted Hutchins to invite Stein to their Great Books class the following week. Stein writes to Van Vechten: “[B]ut this is a dead secret nobody knows that I am going to do it.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> So it happened that Stein—unannounced to anyone—showed up to teach the Hutchins and Adler class, a two-hour discussion of Aristophanes and epic poetry (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 343).
		</p>
<p>
		  What happened in that class? And more generally, why did Stein show such resistance to the Great Books program and Adler such resistance to Stein? Before offering  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein’s reaction to teaching Great Books and her own account of the dinner debate with Adler and Hutchins, I would like to outline several issues that emerge from Stein’s distinctive critique of Adler’s program. Overall, her clash with Adler reveals her complicated response to literary reception, to being favored by a popular audience including the women of Chicago rather than by a university crowd that was mostly men, even as that university was making changes to become less specialized and broader in its curriculum. Stein also quite likely had a problem with the pedagogical stiffness of Adler’s approach, his humorless aesthetic, and his rules guiding “how to read a book.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Moreover, Stein had her own sense of how her work should fit—and was fitting—within a canon of English literature. She almost definitely knew that Adler did not allow room for her, especially since the works on his syllabus when she taught from it did not include any works originally written in English or written by women.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> That is, despite Stein’s ability to play the “short-haired” man, her gender was clearly an impediment to inclusion in his literary canon. Finally, Stein did not believe in ideas in the same sense that Adler did, or rather, she had conceived of a different way in which her works contained ideas. She maintained, on the one hand, that ideas could be a kind of feeling—an experience in language—rather than a position to be debated in class. (And of course to argue that a text is untranslatable is to commit oneself to the experience of its particular language, not to its ideas, as I will discuss more fully below.) Yet Stein also maintained, on the other hand, that apart from an author’s or a reader’s experience of a text, the ideas were still there. Stein both celebrated personality as a governing factor of literary interpretation (how one “feels” a text) and she also argued that personality is absent from what makes a text great.

<p>
		  By her own account Gertrude Stein had an entertaining time teaching Great Books students. In a letter she wrote afterwards to Van Vechten, she admits to “immensely” enjoying the course because “they teach by talking.” She writes to him: “they are interesting students and they say good things to you and they catch you up and it goes hammer and tongs pretty well and I liked it I like it a lot, it lasted almost two hours and I guess a good time was enjoyed by all.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Stein was a great talker: her problem with the course clearly had nothing to do with this classroom experience at the University of Chicago. Stein’s recollection of her time at Radcliffe in the 1890s, however, suggests that she would have been suspicious of some basic pedagogical methods of university teaching. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, Stein describes her inability to take an examination in William James’s philosophy class, instead writing him a note saying, “I am so sorry but really I do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy today.” According to Stein, James wrote her back the next day to say that he understood “perfectly how you feel” and he “gave her work the highest mark in his course.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Learning, for Stein, came about through experience, not through test taking or right and wrong answers. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, she writes: “To me when a thing is really interesting it is when there is no question and no answer, if there is then already the subject is not interesting and it is so, that is the reason that anything for which there is a solution is not interesting” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 220).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		  Whereas Stein emphasizes what is “interesting” and how a reader might prioritize pleasure rather than a stable “solution,” Adler seeks the fundamental ideas that writers of Great Books put forth, or as Stein describes his aim, he wanted to find “all the ideas that had been important in the world’s history.”<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Indeed, Adler spent years compiling a list of ideas that the Great Books supposedly contain—102, according to him, catalogued and cross-referenced in his 2,428-page appendix with the title, “The Syntopicon.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Stein’s description of her heated discussion with Adler and Hutchins emphasizes why she does not believe in the concept of ideas as espoused by the Great Books program. Stein believes that ideas about identity are much more interesting than the “sociological or government ideas” that can be extracted from Great Books, catalogued, and debated in a class. This is not to say that Stein was an introvert or solipsist—hardly the case— but that much of her work explores a relationship between language that is a “feeling of moving” and identity that is unfixed. She describes her conversation with Adler and Hutchins in a long passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    What are the ideas that are important I asked him. Here said he is the list of them I took the list and looked it over. Ah I said I notice that none of the books read at any time by them was originally written in English, was that intentional I asked him. No he said but in English there have really been no ideas expressed. Then I gather that to you there are no ideas which are not sociological or government ideas. Well are they he said, well yes I said. Government is the least interesting thing in human life, creation and expression of that creation is a damn sight more interesting . . . real ideas are not the relation of human beings as groups but a human being to himself inside him and that is an idea that is more interesting than humanity in groups . . .

<p class="continued">
		    What Stein means by “inside” is central to understanding her disagreement with the Great Books men. The word occurs frequently in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, most memorably in the passage where she describes her first bout with writer’s block after returning to France from America:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      Nothing inside me needed to be written. Nothing needed any word and there was no word inside me that could not be spoken and so there was no word inside me. And I was not writing. I began to worry about identity. I had always been I because I had words that had to be written inside me. And now any word I had inside could be spoken it did not need to be written. I am I because my little dog knows me
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 66).
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      Stein here connects her identity with the language “inside” of her: writing is identity come to the surface. Stein’s writing is “inside” language made visible and public; identity thus becomes outwardly recognizable in that her dog knows her. This writing—words “that could not be spoken”—is different from speech, which Stein uses more practically. She understands her relationship to written words in terms of their capacity to define who she understands herself to be: writing mines the origins and creation of the self, taking the form of puns, dislocations, associations, and rhythms of the English language to emphasize formation and development. Stein’s problem with Adler is thus not only intellectual but also aesthetic, in the sense that she believes literary greatness  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> should include the language of movement and fluidity that is the direction American literature (specifically hers) is going.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Furthermore, Stein likely objected to Adler and Hutchins’s claim that ideas like “justice”—as purely a “sociological” or “government” idea—can transcend the text. As a point of contrast, the final words of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> (“The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain”) conre “justice” in context of the poem’s celebration of domestic, artistic, and sexual re-inventions as suggested by the poem’s verbal play. That is, justice depends on how one reads “likeness”; it depends on how one reads “asparagus” and “fountain”; it depends on juxtapositions within the text itself. Stein’s “justice” is also framed by the historical moment of the text’s production: the poem’s challenge to masculine power, to heterosexual conventions, and to representational art is particularly sharp when considering the text’s 1914 publication. But one point to notice about the very term “Great Books” is that it emphasizes books, not the people who wrote them or the cultures out of which the texts emerged. The course was not referred to as “The Great Philosophers.” Adler believed that Great Books offer a reader a deeper awareness of “the great and enduring truths of human life.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> The truths endure; the authors do not. One can find meaning in Great Books—at least in the way that Adler and Hutchins taught them—divorced from their historical and biographical contexts. But Gertrude Stein’s very idea about the origins of language suggests that it would have been very difficult for her to separate her “inside” from the texts that she wrote.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In Stein’s case, the book that made her into a popular literary re—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>—was impossible to isolate from biography and history, because the book itself was the story of Stein and Toklas’s life together, centering on their artistic salon in Paris and their relationships with such res as Picasso, Matisse, and Hemingway. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is a kind of twentieth-century local history, not a work in which Adler’s ideas would be embedded. Stein’s prose in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is relatively easy and bears resemblance to conversation, capturing the fact that she surrounded herself with people who would listen to her talk. If the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> puts forth any ideas, then they are so caught in situation and conversation as to be unrecognizable outside of the context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>. This book that made Stein famous—and which is still the book that keeps Stein selling—is a book that by Adler’s standards would not be called great.
		    </p>
<p>
		      However, some would argue that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is not representative of Stein’s real stylistic innovations, and not a work that best represents Stein’s ideas. If its language is more like spoken than written English, then by Stein’s own terms it is not a book about what lies “inside” of her, a fact that she playfully acknowledges by positioning the work from Toklas’s point of view. The prose is certainly very different from other pieces that Stein wrote—for instance, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span>, which Stein was writing simultaneously while she wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, as an antidote to the more accessible prose.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> (And whereas the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> was a bestseller, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> was not published in full until after Stein died.) Perhaps the more experimental language of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> is the better example of a text through which Stein realizes ideas “inside” of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> her, which is to say that reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> is an experience of understanding the work- ings of language, its openness, and creative potential. Consider for example the poem’s final fourteen lines:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
		      Why am I if I am uncertain reasons may inclose.
		    <br>
		      Remain remain propose repose chose.
		    <br>
		      I call carelessly that the door is open.
		    <br>
		      Which if they can refuse to open
		    <br>
		      No one can rush to close.
		    <br>
		      Let them be mine therefore.
		    <br>
		      Everybody knows that I chose.
		    <br>
		      Therefor if therefor before I close.
		    <br>
		      I will therefore offer therefore I offer this.
		    <br>
		      Which if I refuse to miss can be miss is mine.
		    <br>
		      I will be well welcome when I come.
		    <br>
		      Because I am coming.
		    <br>
		      Certainly I come having come.
		    <br>
		        These stanzas are done.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      The title <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> includes the Italian word for “room” and thus the open door in this final stanza extends the poem’s metaphorical space. The long poem may “close” and be “done” but the “I” wonders whether she can be “certain” of herself if there are many uncertainties, if the “door is open,” questions “remain,” and there is promise of more to “come.” Stein refuses an ending to a poem that emphasizes the flexibility of “I” as it flexes the capabilities of language. Furthermore, with the gentlest gesture to a sonnet sequence, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> also suggests development, the building of each poem or stanza upon the former through repetition and rhythm rather than narrative chronology—a beginning, middle, and end—or specificity of application. That is, the meditation is available to all of us. Stein of course upholds the idea that her writing is applicable to everyone in her autobiographies—as emphasized in the title of her second, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, as if despite the particularity of her life, everyone can understand a narrative of change and development. <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span>, however, is not like her autobiographical narratives: what she achieves by writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> from the “inside” is an exploration of the formation of identity not at the level of chronology and event but at the level of the structure of language.
		    </p>
<p>
		      The lack of particularity in much of Stein’s more experimental work, despite Stein’s play with proper names and references to her own life, informs a persuasive critical account of Stein’s work that emphasizes its impersonality and runs counter to a reader-centered approach. This understanding of Stein’s language has roots in Stein’s desire to have her works considered great, or in her own words, considered to be “master-pieces.” For instance, Jennifer Ashton argues that Stein herself insisted “on the autonomy of the work of art precisely by refusing any relation whatsoever between the work and anyone who might experience it, including the author herself.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Readers may respond to Stein’s work idiosyncratically, but according to Ashton, “their responses and experiences have nothing to do with what makes it art.” Ashton challenges a model  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of reading that advocates the subject position of both poet and reader to inform the meaning of the text, citing language poets like Lynn Hejinian and Susan Howe, who “turn to Stein as their mascot.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> To read a text impersonally, a reader’s “experience” cannot be equated with a text’s meaning. Stein herself suggests this approach to reading in a lecture that she gave on returning to Europe soon after her American tour, titled “What are Master-Pieces and Why are There so Few of Them.” Here, she offers an explanation that contradicts her earlier claims both about a reader’s pleasure and a writer’s “inside.” Stein maintains that a literary work is “no longer the property of the one who wrote it” and exists because it “came to be as something that is an end in itself and in that respect it is opposed to the business of living.”<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Stein’s shift in how she thought about literary texts suggests that she was less worried about <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> her work was known before she became a celebrity, but once she was assured that people knew of it, she wished that judgments of literary value not be predicated on the contingencies of a reader’s experience, or “the business of living.” But the very word “master-piece” reveals that Stein could never fully give up on the idea of a “master”—that is, an actual person—behind the work of art. The title of the lecture also indicates that her time in Chicago with the Great Books men continued to preoccupy her: she did not reject the idea that some works transcended others but she created a very different set of criteria to judge the distinction of “master-piece,” criteria that would naturally include her own writing.
		    </p>
<p>
		      The work that Stein promoted most aggressively as a masterpiece was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>, completed in 1911 but not published until 1925, a text to which she dedicated an entire lecture during her American tour and advertised again in her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture. Her claims about its literary value also reveal her vacillation between different modes of how this “master-piece” should be read. In her lecture “The Gradual Making of the Making of Americans,” Stein describes how she aimed to embody in this novel the uniquely American experience of temporality, “a space that is filled with moving, a space of time that is filled always filled with moving.” She explains that the long paragraphs, repetition, and sheer length of the novel were to enact “just how many seconds minutes or hours it is going to take to do a whole thing” which “everybody knows who is an American.”<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture also explains the novel in terms of its relationship to time, in this case time that rejects Aristotelian narrative structure: “A great deal perhaps all of my writing of The Making of Americans was an effort to escape from this thing to escape from inevitably feeling that anything that everything had meaning as beginning and middle and ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Her exegesis promotes reading as an experience—an experience of time’s “wholeness” or suspension rather than an artificial wholeness indicated by two points in time with a defined middle. But she also suggests in the first lecture that she wanted <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> to be a work that could be read impersonally: that by describing in the novel “every kind of human being that ever was or is or would be living,” Stein writes, “the enigma of the universe could in this way be solved.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>, according to this latter claim, offers readers an absolute conception of humankind, not an occasion for an experience in atemporality. Stein thus defines literary value both in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terms of a reader’s experience and a text’s intellectual stake in the “enigma” of human beings—that is, in different “kinds” of identities. And if <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> puts forth ideas, then they are not fixed ideas as Adler would have catalogued them, for Stein’s writing, as she describes it, is “always filled with moving.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      Adler’s and Stein’s accounts of their quarrel at the Hutchins’s dinner party will illuminate one final point about Stein’s aesthetic, especially as it relates to the issue of translation. Adler clearly did not recognize that Stein’s critique of his program, though serious, was also marked with humor, which both Stein and Toklas used to goad him. At the end of the evening as the party was breaking up, according to Adler, Toklas turned to him and said what I quote as an epigraph: “This has been a wonderful evening. Gertrude has said things tonight that it will take her 10 years to understand.” Adler remembers these words as if they are the final say on Stein. But in fact Toklas’s comment embodies Stein’s explanation of how to “understand” her language: enjoy the fact that its meaning is not fixed, that it will take more time to appreciate. Toklas is not patronizing Stein behind her back, she is celebrating Stein’s aesthetic. Stein did not speak straightly—straightness was never her style—including when she questioned Adler about translation. “Ah I said I notice that none of the books read at any time by them was originally written in English,” as Stein writes in her account, “was that intentional I asked him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 212–13). As many knew, Adler himself spoke no languages other than English—Stein did—and as someone herself on the fringes of the academy, she would have known exactly how to tweak Adler’s intellectual insecurity.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Stein did not actually have a problem with translations of literary works. She may have disagreed with Adler’s handling of translation—he famously did not consider the quality of the translations he promoted in his Great Books courses—and this would chafe at Stein’s attention to the materiality and pleasure in the experience of language. But Stein herself translated texts into English and promoted translations of her own work. Several books of hers were translated into French during her lifetime, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> An excerpt of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> also appeared in French translation.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Like many modernist writers, Stein may have understood translation to be an essentially generative and creative act, not an exercise in merely imparting a text’s essential content as Adler treated it.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Or Stein may have recognized, on some level, that her language was already a translation of sorts. That is, “Steinish,” as the Chicago papers called it (or “Estonian” for Butcher), was the product of being surrounded by foreign languages for her entire life: from the languages of her German-Jewish parents and her early childhood years in Paris and Vienna through the cosmopolitan environment of her Paris salon. Though she rarely wrote in French (despite living in France for thirty-five years), her English was undoubtedly influenced by her immersion in a European polyglot, an experience that helped to clarify her own linguistic aims. Stein’s familiarity with foreign vocabularies made her sharply aware of the texture and nuance of the English language, especially its rhythms, and she sensed in Adler someone entirely inattentive to its complexities.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Stein did not buy into the Hutchins and Adler program but these professorial men—and the contrast she felt between her mainstream audience and a masculine  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> university culture—emphasized a difference between popularity and literary posterity. Stein agreed with Adler’s conviction that only a limited number of books were great: she simply would have included her works and many other works on the list. Englishlanguage writers, women writers, and most importantly, according to Stein, modernists with her aesthetic should not be excluded from a definition of what constitutes a “master-piece.” Though the English department found her lectures akin to Dadaism, Stein traced her writing back through an English canon that includes, as she sketches it in “What is English Literature,” Austen, Dickens, Swift, Gibbon, Pope, Johnson, Milton, Shakespeare, and Chaucer (among others). As she frequently proclaimed of herself, she was a “genius,” the kind of rare re whose work transcends the ages. “I should think it makes no difference,” she writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span>, “That so few people are me. / That is to say in each generation there are so few geniuses.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> Stein’s objectives during her lecture tour in America—in Chicago and beyond—included recognition at the most prestigious American colleges and universities. She welcomed institutional fame.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      Moreover, one of Stein’s most frequent explanations for her use of repetition was that she wanted her writing to transcend time. In the 1920s she coined the term “continuous present” to describe her first attempts to escape chronological narrative structure, a strategy put to work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans.</span><a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> And in one of the last interviews she gave before she died, she said: “If time exists your writing is ephemeral. You can have a historical time but for you the time does not exist and if you are writing about the present the time element must cease to exist.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Stein wanted to write a book in which historical temporality could be suspended and something else could come to the forefront—not an idea by Adler’s definition, but an idea in the sense of a reader’s experience of “existing” in time, a reader’s sense of the formative power of language. But the fame that Gertrude Stein experienced in the 1930s changed her; it forced her to question herself “inside” and thus to question the source of her creativity. Writing came very easily and plentifully to Stein before her lecture tour, but fame as she described it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> and elsewhere was the source of her extended writer’s block.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> An aesthetic that conflated language with identity would naturally be challenged when identity was the subject of public scrutiny. In her third <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture, Stein in fact criticizes how newspapers misleadingly order events, giving a false impression of what has happened, and turning events into yesterday’s news. Newspapers often overlook the more important aspects of “existing,” Stein argues, including no doubt the event of her own existing in America. “I said newspapers make things too easy,” she writes, as if America’s influence on her and Stein’s influence on America is too diffuse for a newspaper’s conventional narrative structure (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37). And in the last lecture, she comically understates the impact of her “adventures” with American audiences, which were much bigger and more varied than she had ever expected, and which fundamentally shaped Stein’s literary aesthetic. “I have really found out quite a good deal about what an audience is,” Stein says, “by a simple series of adventures with it” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 47).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
			Was Stein an “invincible force” or was she an “immovable object,” as Fanny Butcher remembers her? The parallelism of Butcher’s sentence points to Stein as the “force” but the ambiguity of Butcher’s metaphorical language also foresees Stein’s presence and absence in the critical reception of her work. Even if Stein’s personality continues to exert itself upon how her work is read, Stein has also been treated as an object, in the sense that many literary, political, and cultural movements have claimed her as one of their own. Her <span style="font-style:italic;">autobiography</span>, as she somehow knew, is <span style="font-style:italic;">everybody’s</span>. Indeed, the status of Stein’s readers, the approaches to reading Stein’s texts, and her ideas about translation are as many-sided as Gertrude Stein herself. Though her “adventures” in Chicago emphasize ostensible divisions among classes, genders, and geographies, her ability to move among so many different kinds of readers—and appeal to them with her “moving” language—in fact breaks down these very divisions.
		      </p>
<p>
			As the Great Books philosophy gained nation-wide attention and was promoted as a curriculum in which ordinary men and women outside of the university could participate, it also became a movement with cross-over appeal, especially as it drew in readers dubbed middlebrow.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Dwight MacDonald—one of Mortimer Adler’s most vehement critics—widely criticized Great Books for being “Midcult,” that is, a bastardized version of High Culture that could be bought in a fifty-four-volume set.<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> And in his essays criticizing Great Books, MacDonald lumped Gertrude Stein into his example of what kind of art, in his terms, constitutes highbrow culture.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> But the uniqueness of Stein’s work and its reception, as I have been suggesting, fundamentally challenges many distinctions that might be drawn about the nature of her modernism.
		      </p>
<p>
			Mortimer Adler, too, is a difficult man to categorize. At one point—and this is a deeply ironic fact—he was alleged to write in a style very much like Gertrude Stein’s. These two adversaries superficially appeared to be much closer than they would have acknowledged. One folder in Adler’s voluminous and uncatalogued archives concerns the publication of a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> , which Adler wrote and Maude Hutchins illustrated (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). (She was at the time still married to Robert Hutchins.) It is a strange, provocative union of image and text. Hutchins’s line drawings of androgynous naked res in positions that suggest Greek gymnastics give one an indication of her future novels, prolific in their exploration of sexual fantasy and lesbian desire. Adler’s prose pieces, on the other hand, have titles like “Axiom,” “Topic,” “Description,” and “Analysis.” Here is the part titled “Analysis”:

			  Random House published <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> in a limited edition three years before Adler met Stein. <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine, not surprisingly, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> a “bewildering book” and then closed its review with this description: “To hardboiled booksellers <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> last week recalled Jacob Epstein’s sketches . . . and the literary monotones of Gertrude Stein.”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> Adler replied in a livid letter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine, “I don’t know whether you offend Jacob Epstein and Gertrude Stein as much as you do us, by comparing us to them or them to us. The comparison could only rest on the fact that all the things you don’t understand look alike.”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> Adler suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span>’s readers lack discrimination; difficult prose is all the same to them. What he misses is the reality that many of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> readers who read <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine would also embrace Stein and find pleasure in her work though very few bought <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span>. The emptiness of his prose—driven by logic, sheer content, and no form—is very different from the richness of Stein’s wordplay, which enrolled a wide audience into her modernist aesthetic. Adler in his letter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> thus has a very good point: his prose only superficially resembles Stein’s. His purely logical claims lack the humor and associative power of Stein’s language and there is little sense of the person who lies behind Adler’s propositions. To compare Stein’s prose with Adler’s is to emphasize the difference between a style that is attached to its maker and one that is not, a style associated with the personality of the author and style that seems to have no particular person behind it.
			</p>
<p>
			  In looking at how popular audiences welcomed Stein’s work, it becomes clear that it was virtually impossible for them to remove Stein herself from the text. A persuasive approach to finding meaningful pleasure in Stein’s work, as I have argued, continues to rely on personality as a governing factor—both Stein’s and a reader’s. And yet, another approach to reading Stein’s work is to treat it as if Stein the writer is not there, to read it like one should read Adler’s propositions, impersonally. I would like to conclude with a famous response to Stein’s work that conjoins these two theoretical approaches, whose historical and sociological underpinnings, I have argued, should be prioritized in our critical understanding of Stein’s work. After Yale University Press published its last posthumous volume of her work in 1957, John Ashbery reviewed <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> for <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> magazine. His review is titled “The Impossible,” which suggests the extent of his admiration for Stein: she did what no one else had done. “The poem is a hymn to possibility,” Ashbery writes, “a celebration of the fact that the world exists, that things can happen.” <a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> What is remarkable about Ashbery’s wry praise is that he also could be describing, in Mortimer Adler’s terms, what constitutes a great book: “it is usually not events which interest Miss Stein,” Ashbery writes, “rather it is their ‘way of happening,’ and the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> is a general, all-purpose model which each reader can adapt to fit his own set of particulars.”<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> The non-specificity that Ashbery emphasizes—the way that the text offers “a general, all-purpose model” rather than being contingent upon a particular history or the writer’s “inside” story— is near the justification that Adler gives of what makes a book great: it lasts through the years because it applies to everyone; it is inexhaustible. But Ashbery also suggests that each reader can adapt the text to “his own set of particulars,” which is to say that a reader can bring to bear his or her personality upon the text, rather than working to locate its fixed ideas, its essential meaning. Although Ashbery’s sense of adaptability is not exactly the same thing as accessibility, these qualities are related, as Stein herself knew. To feel that you can adapt a work of art to your own life is to have some real kind of access to it. The aim is not total comprehension or mastery—which Stein’s texts in fact challenge—but a sense of a text’s possibility.
			</p>
<p>
			  Stein’s profound influence on later writers—on Ashbery, for instance, and on twentieth- and twenty-first-century poetry more broadly—is proof that her writing has achieved some of the qualities that define a great book, not by Adler’s standards but by her own. Though <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> established her celebrity  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> status, her more experimental work, paradoxically, has had equally strong staying power. Stein’s visits to Chicago during 1934 and 1935 illuminate different approaches to reading Stein’s texts among the city’s various audiences, approaches that continue to dominate our theoretical understanding of Stein’s work today. Her time in Chicago clarifies how and why she oscillated between groups of readers, between the concept of reading as an experience and reading as a pursuit of ideas. Stein was charmed by the attention that she received in America, particularly by her intimacy with Chicago’s literary women and by the enthusiasm of the crowds at her public lectures and at the University of Chicago. These experiences strengthened Stein’s sense of the literary standard she wanted to achieve: “moving” language that was open and mobile, much like the city of Chicago itself.

			    Many recent studies of modernism have taken issue with Andreas Huyssen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</span> (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986) and the critical accounts of modernism as mainstream are now quite numerous. Most relevant to my argument is Karen Leick’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gertrude Stein and the Making of an American Celebrity</span> (London and New York: Routledge, 2009), which usefully details the response of the American press to Stein and her work—although not Stein’s response to it. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gertrude Stein, Modernism, and the Problem of “Genius”</span> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), Barbara Will also argues against a division between high modernism’s investment in artistic “genius” and democratic tendencies in Stein’s writing.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  “Forms of Havoc: The Malatesta Cantos and The Battler” demonstrates Ezra Pound’s exploration of boxing as an aesthetic practice through the use of boxing terminology and images in The Malatesta Cantos , reframing the text as a meditation on the constituent properties of aestheticized violence, and suggesting boxing’s impact on the formal features of the text itself. The article recovers Pound’s circulation in Parisian boxing subculture during the early 1920’s, and argues that the hectic style of boxing Pound practiced, known as battling, provided a contemporary vocabulary to make legible Malatesta’s life as a <span style="font-style:italic;">condotierro</span>, as well as the conceptual terminology for aesthetic violence in The Malatesta Cantos.

<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>
	  In his 1967 memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting and Bombardiering</span>, Wyndham Lewis offers a rare glimpse into the boxing of Ezra Pound and Ernest Hemingway:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Having found [Pound’s] abode, I rang the bell. A great deal of noise was to be heard but no one answered: therefore I pushed open the door, which opened practically into the studio. A splendidly built young man, stripped to the waist, and with a torso of dazzling white, was standing not far from me. He was tall, handsome, and serene, and was repelling with his boxing gloves a hectic assault of Ezra’s. After a final swing at the solar plexus Pound fell back upon his settee. That man was Hemingway.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  At first blush, Lewis’s anecdote seems to confirm many of the qualities associated with Pound and Hemingway as writers and literary res: Hemingway as uber-masculine and highly disciplined, Pound as comfortably frenetic, on the razor’s edge between collapse and creation. As this essay will make clear, a more acute synthesis of boxing and aesthetics can be seen in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the text Pound was drafting at the time of Lewis’s visit: the Malatesta Cantos. Lewis’s account, however, offers only a partial reconstruction of what these sparring sessions might have been like, and Hemingway’s description in a 1922 letter to Sherwood Anderson paints a fuller portrait:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I’ve been teaching Pound to box wit [sic] little success. He habitually leads wit his chin and has the general grace of the crayfish or crawfish. He’s willing but short winded. Going over there this afternoon for another session but there aint much job in it as I have to shadow box between rounds to get up a sweat.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Three weeks later, Hemingway wrote to Howell Jenkins,
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I’m boxing regular with Ezra Pound, and he has developed a terrific wallop. I can usually cross myself though before he lands them and when he gets too tough I dump him on the floor. He is a good game guy and has come along to beat hell wit [sic] the gloves—someday I will get careless and he will knock me for a row of latrines.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Hemingway echoes Lewis’s impression of his own athletic superiority and Pound’s lack of stamina. He also diagnoses Pound’s lack of technique in leading “wit his chin,” that is, attacking with his head out in front of his body rather than squarely balanced over his feet in a way that corroborates Pound’s self-inflicted fall. In another letter Hemingway suggested that the pedagogy was reciprocal, “I’m teaching Pound how to box and he’s helping me with my writing.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> What Lewis experiences as a display of crude will against athletic prowess, Hemingway glosses as an act of instruction corollary to Pound’s aesthetic tutelage.
	</p>
<p>
	  Critics have been keen to sketch the parameters of the Pound/Hemingway friendship, often stressing the influence Pound had on Hemingway’s early writing, both materially, as the animating force behind Hemingway’s publishing connections in Paris, London, and New York, and artistically, as someone who encouraged particular aesthetic values in Hemingway.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hemingway’s debt to imagism—his use of concrete language, rigorous precision, and stress on the reservoirs of significance in the objective world—are often attributed to his relationship with Pound, though critics debate whether Pound’s ideas about literature provided a program for the young Hemingway to model, or strengthened lines of aesthetic development that Hemingway was already pursuing.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Hemingway’s letter frames boxing and writing as reciprocal practices, the other half of the literary pedagogy we commonly take to be so integral to their relationship.
	</p>
<p>
	  Yet an interest in the Pound/Hemingway literary friendship has failed to account for its sustained interest in boxing. Noted by biographers but unregarded as a point of critical interest, Pound’s journey through Paris’s boxing subculture from 1920 to 1924 involved more than sparring sessions with Hemingway; he also frequented bouts at stadiums such as the Velodrome d’Hiver and the Cirque du Paris. Yet boxing is not merely a biographical curiosity, but also a neglected constituent of Pound’s literary aesthetic, particularly in the fruitfully troubled confluence of aesthetics and antagonism.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Pound’s early correspondence from his years in London often employs a slugging  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> persona, full of knockouts and bravado, as a way of ring literary debate. In a 1912 letter to Harriet Monroe, Pound insists, “It’s only when a few men who know, get together and <span style="font-style:italic;">disagree</span> that any sort of criticism is born . . . I’ve got a right to be severe. For one man I strike there are ten to strike back at me. I stand exposed. It hits me in my dinner invitations, in my weekends, in reviews of my own work. Nevertheless it’s a good t.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Battling against a literary orthodoxy, the idea of a fistt is a metaphor for struggling against “people who don’t care for the master-work . . . who make no effort toward the best, who are content with publicity and the praise of reviewers.” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 46). Pound’s sense of valuing a “good t” in literary circles is also expressed in a 1909 letter to William Carlos Williams:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    If you have saved any pennies during your stay in Nueva York, you’d better come across and broaden your mind. American doctors are in great demand in Italy, especially during the touring season. Besides, you’d much prefer to <span style="font-style:italic;">scrap</span> with an intelligent person like myself than with a board of directing idiots (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 41; my emphasis).
	  </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  In 1917 Pound would offer his head to Williams as a speed bag during an epistolary argument, “Or will you carry my head on a platter? Or would you like it brought over to be punched??” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 181). Later, in a 1928 letter to James Vogel, Pound continues to re literary debate in boxing terms, writing that, “The ones with nothing to say get scared, are afraid to recognize the qualities of others for fear there won’t be a place on the bandwagon for themselves, etc. NO GOOD WORK EVER KNOCKED OUT ANY OTHER GOOD WORK” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 221).
	</p>
<p>
	  Shot through with a related kind of aestheticized antagonism, the Malatesta Cantos are intricately webbed in this nexus of boxing and literary friendship. Like Hemingway’s <span style="font-style:italic;">in our time</span>, Henry Strater’s illustrations inform the deluxe edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Draft of XVI Cantos</span>, in which the Malatesta Cantos first appeared in book form. Hemingway himself might be said to be equally important to the Malatesta Cantos in a less apparent way. In 1923 Hemingway accompanied Pound on a walking tour of southern France and Italy which composed part of his research efforts from May 1922 to April 1923 for this section of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, offering Pound logistical help with many of the battles incorporated into the Malatesta Cantos.
	</p>
<p>
	  Critics have drawn due attention to the Tempio Malatestiano, the sepulcher built by Malatesta which contains the remains of Isotta degli Atti, his mistress and later third wife, as a model for, or expression of, the artistic vision of the Malatesta Cantos. Lawrence Rainey’s authoritative study of the Malatesta Cantos, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ezra Pound and the Monument of Culture</span>, confirms in its title a preference for the Tempio Malatestiano as an aesthetic ideal “which shaped [Pound’s] thinking at the outset of his work in 1922 and, indeed, for the rest of his life.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Through meticulous historical research, Rainey crystallizes a long-established strain of thinking about the Tempio’s importance for the Malatesta Cantos. In an early appraisal, Thomas Jackson suggests that “the image of successful direction voluntatis is the Temple, not Malatesta’s entire personality.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> As Christine Brooke-Rose puts it, “What [Pound] is really interested in is the building of the Temple, Sigismondo’s tribute to Isotta and the manifestation of his wholeness as a man,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as a patron of the arts and a true representative of the Renaissance.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Michael André Bernstein makes a more explicit comparison when he suggests, “Just as Sigismondo Malatesta constructs his Tempio out of whatever material is at hand and whatever artists he can employ, so Pound builds his presentation not just of Sigismondo himself, but of the entire era, out of a series of brief, memorable incidents.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Tempio’s palimpsest of Renaissance architecture over an existing gothic church, it’s blending of pagan and sacred iconography, its sheer heterogeneity and permanence, it is argued, all lend themselves to the formal features of Pound’s sprawling epic.
	</p>
<p>
	  Without taking away from the importance of the Tempio as a cultural product that Pound thinks seriously about, I wish to point out what is perhaps all too obvious about the Malatesta Cantos. That is, their preoccupation with the often violent process surrounding the Tempio’s production, indeed, with the very battles that Hemingway was logistically ring for Pound in 1923. Throughout Cantos VIII–XI, Malatesta ts—“And he fought in Fano,” “And he fought like ten devils at Monteluro,” “And we beat the papishes and fought/ them back through the tents,” “And he came up to the dyke-gate/ And fought through the dyke-gate”—as a contracted, professional warrior whose great aesthetic work is produced in, and often because of, a swirl of incessant violence.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In focusing on the formal properties of the Tempio, we miss the ways in which the Malatesta sequence puts these acts of violence and warfare at the core of Malatesta’s enduring cultural relevance.
	</p>
<p>
	  If a focus on the Tempio overlooks the Malatesta Cantos’ insistence on the historical record of Malatesta’s ting, its consequences are twofold. First, it has occluded the ways in which the Malatesta Cantos are an explicit meditation on the efficacy of violence in cultural production. Second, the legacy of Malatesta’s battles is doubly important for the ways that the working through of this idea involves the informing aesthetic of modern boxing. Kasia Boddy and David Scott have both recently suggested, though in very different ways, that boxing in the early twentieth century is a mass cultural sport with aesthetic valences, and the Malatesta Cantos belong very much in any conversation about the aesthetic potential of boxing or modern sport more generally.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  That said, the mass appeal associated with boxing was the furthest thing from Pound’s aim with the Malatesta Cantos. Pound followed the completion of the Malatesta sequence in 1923 with a letter to Kate Buss, in which he describes their publication in “a dee looks edtn of my Cantos (about 16 of ‘em, I think) of UNRIVALLED magnificence. Price 25 dollars per copy, and 50 and 100 bones for Vellum and illuminateds . . . Not for the Vulgus” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 187). Still, the Malatesta Cantos are an important stitch historically in Pound’s triangulated relationship with Hemingway and boxing during these years, and as will become clear shortly, Pound’s first extended meditation on the constituent properties of artistic and cultural production. In this essay I will recover the deep situation of the Malatesta Cantos in boxing discourse through their appropriation of the re of the battler: an untrained, exceedingly rough type of ter who articulated concerns in contemporaneous boxing discourse regarding the possibilities of recklessness and violence being undergirded by technical maxims. I will show how the formal developments most associated with the Malatesta Cantos internalize and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> project the imperatives of battling, and argue that a battling aesthetic pivots the notions of technique and form—so central to the aesthetic importance of the Malatesta Cantos, and whatever we may term the shared aesthetic of Pound and Hemingway—toward their formulation at sites of popular culture.
	</p>
<p>
	  Because few would argue with the importance of the Malatesta Cantos for both the fate of the Cantos as a whole and for the formal possibilities of modernist poetry, its relationship to boxing is a question of particular importance for modernist studies more generally. As Myles Slatin insightfully put it some time ago, “the design of [The Cantos] suddenly crystallized . . . as a result of the long and intensive labor which went into the Malatesta group.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Critics who differ on the salient implications of the Malatesta Cantos, for instance Lawrence Rainey, Marjorie Perloff, Richard Sieburth, and Michael André Bernstein, all agree on the transformative nature of the Malatesta Cantos for poetic form. Cantos VIII–XI mark Pound’s use of collage—the wholesale incorporation of blocks of quoted text—and his challenge to cherished distinctions between prose and poetry, poetry and history, high art and everyday culture.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> To revisit the Malatesta Cantos through the lens of modern boxing is to recognize the text’s assertion of the contingency of cultural production on a particular kind of violence, but simultaneously on a mass cultural discourse with a similar vocabulary for formal and technical violence. In this way, I will open up avenues for talking about modernist aesthetics in a way that depends on the dialectical relationship between modernist literature and popular culture, and which reconsiders the perceived antipathy of the Malatesta Cantos to mass cultural forms. The Malatesta Cantos demonstrate not only a delight in boxing, but a recognition of the aesthetic affinities between boxing and the innovations of modernist literary practice.

<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>
	  Rather than school Pound in the kind of scientific boxing which he knew well, Hemingway’s letters suggest that he encouraged Pound to box wildly, “to beat hell wit the gloves.” What Pound cultivated during those sessions was not the calculated precision of technical strategy, but a “terrific wallop,” and the capacity to “knock [one] for a row of latrines.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> While Lewis undoubtedly focuses more on Hemingway in his description of Pound and Hemingway sparring, the kind of ter embodied by Pound—rough, unskilled, excessively violent—was actually more integral for Pound’s literary production. In the early decades of the twentieth century, this description could have applied to any number of professional ters—Ad Wolgast, Battling Siki, Luis Ángel Firpo, Jack Dempsey, Oscar “Battling” Nelson, Jess Willard—all of whom were understood to be the kind of ter known as a “battler.” Hemingway’s most extended meditation on this re is the 1925 short story, “The Battler”; since the Malatesta Cantos lack such an eponymous connection, some identification of the key issues and ideas drawn together by the battler in boxing discourse will be necessary to secure their own link. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> magazine, the battler is a ter who “absolutely lacks science, makes no pretense at skillful boxing, but who depends wholly upon his terrific punching  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> powers to bring an opponent into submission.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> As ters of mesmerizing brutality and punching power, battlers were thought to be excessively violent and devoid of the ring tactics used by more cagey boxers. Their lack of “scientific” skill amounted to a form of savagery, and were often animalized or referred to as “cave-men” or “primitives.” For example, Jack London, who wrote boxing reportage for <span style="font-style:italic;">The San Francisco Examiner</span> from 1901–1910, said of heavyweight Jim Jeffries before his 1910 title t with Jack Johnson (which Johnson won) that, “Old mother nature in him is still red of fang and claw. He is more a Germanic tribesman and warrior of two thousand years ago than a civilized man of the twentieth century.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> first appeared on newsstands in 1922—the <span style="font-style:italic;">annus mirabilis</span> of modernism—and was the first transatlantic periodical dedicated to boxing. Intended to extricate boxiana from the salacious pages of publications such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Police Gazette</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Boxing</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Clipper</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> soon became boxing’s most important source of expert commentary and exchange about the emerging technical points of the sport. While <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> made available for public consumption stores of oral knowledge passed down in gyms, backrooms, and training camps, it also red that technical knowledge explicitly as boxing’s calling card in circuits of middle-class respectability: “Take for example,” <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> asked in 1928, “the great ts between Joe Walcott and Kid Lavigne, Joe Gans and Battling Nelson, Ad Wolgast and Battling Nelson [all noted battlers] and a horde of others. There will never be such combats as these under our present system of boxing rules and training. If gladiators were to present the condition in which Walcott and Lavigne found themselves, modern rules would probably call a halt by the referee.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  More importantly, the terms in which this appeal was made—decency established through new techniques and rules—successfully inscribed a particular conception of boxing that marginalized prizeters who relied instead on brute physicality and toughness instead of well-honed skills. In June 1922, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> published “Modern Pugilists Divided into Three Types,” an article in which it divided modern boxers into: “1: Light hitters, but clever boxers. 2: Fairly good boxers, but knockout hitters. 3: Sluggers without boxing skill—the equivalent of a bruiser type of ter.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The “slugger” type would have been synonymous with “battler,” and in fact recalled a cluster of similar epithets—mauler, bruiser, killer, etc. I use the term battler because the word evokes a sense of giving and receiving punishment, but also because it was the single term conjugated into a gerund and used as a moniker for certain ters: Battling Nelson, Battling Levinsky, Battling Siki, among others. Of all the possible names for this particular type of ter, the battler is the one most closely associated by virtue of grammatical flexibility with the conflation of praxis and character which allowed battlers, both black and white, to be labeled “savage” or “primitive.”
	</p>
<p>
	  The battler came to compartmentalize the more “primitive” aspects of boxing—its brutality, instinct, and carnality—during a period in which those qualities were quickly being downplayed. Insofar as there was a logic to battling, the battler was thought to work by instinct, ting without intellection or strategy. Battling Siki, for example, explained his victory over Georges Carpentier thusly, “When I got into the ring I shut  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> both my eyes and swung. I knocked my opponent out. How I did it I do not know.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> That Siki’s answer undercuts the premise of the question (how does one, after all, knock an opponent out without swinging?) suggests a tacit critique of the need for an explanation in the first place. Similarly, in a 1924 interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span>, Jack Dempsey rejected technical explanations for his own success, “I’ve never tried to be clever . . . I have only one thought in my head as I sit in the corner waiting for the t to start: ‘Where am I going to hit him? . . . t in the ring just as you would t on the street. If you’re in a street t you don’t stop to feint and to be clever—you hit! I know only one kind of footwork—the kind that brings me in close enough to sock.’”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  While the battler represented a form of ting at odds with orthodox boxing, the efficacy of battling attracted considerable attention and respect. As one reporter claimed, “Speed, cleverness and strategy are all subordinate to the wallop.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Commentators often foregrounded the battler’s ability to expose the fallacy of conflating sophistication with success, such as when covering Luis Firpo, an Argentinean boxer who briefly contended for the world heavyweight championship: “Firpo reminds the writer of the raw Jim Jeffries he encountered at Corbett’s camp, the Jeffries who bored such a wise handler of boxers as Billy Delaney because he was so ‘awkward’ and knew ‘so little’ about the game.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Ford Madox Ford, with a similar kind of ironic distance, spoke to this idea as well through a fictionalized narrator in <span style="font-style:italic;">Provence: From Minstrels to the Machine</span>:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    A boxer’s brain should be completely empty of every thought—of every desire even, except that for slaughter. Thought is heavy; it adds to the fatigue of combat; thought is relaxing, it slows down the speed of blows; thought softens, it leads you to think that you have punished your adversary sufficiently . . . That is true. As a former judge at I do not know how many Army boxing contests I confirm every word of it.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This interest in complicating assumptions about the processes and mechanics of battling—for in Ford’s novel the move to extinguish thought is a form of willed ratiocination—reflected a similar desire among boxing’s cognoscenti. Trainers and ters began diagramming technical explanations of particularly powerful, “savage” punches, such as the “Rabbit Punch,” or the “Sling Shot.” Advertisements soon appeared in boxing magazines promising “Knockout Punches of Champions, explained by Jimmy DeForest, World-Famous trainer and boxing instructor.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Since battling embodied an unorthodoxy of technique that was so effective, a formal logic was often mapped onto battlers’ seeming randomness of style; boxing experts became ciphers for the battler’s illegible axioms of skill and technique.
	</p>
<p>
	  Thus a tension emerges in the re of the battler regarding the seemingly disjunct concepts of form and recklessness. On the one hand, the battler functions as a kind of proximal antithesis to the discourses of scientific boxing, encapsulating all the particularly violent or reckless facets of the sport that “scientific boxing” excluded. On the other, the battler was also very much a re probed by questions of technique and form invited by the efficacy of precisely this perceived recklessness or instinct. In this way, the battler might be said to displace and locate anxieties about the violence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of boxing onto particular ters (or, more accurately, a particular style which ters could embody), but also to raise a related proposition about the possibilities of giving logic to the seemingly illogical, of formalizing a style of ting which at first glance seems to utterly resist any kind of formal scheme. As a ter who made little sense within the highly methodical style of scientific boxing, the battler offered the possibility for formal and technical sense-making to be consistent with, and not anathema to, excessive and unremitting violence. In this way, the battler tests the limits of modern boxing’s commitment to the discourses of form and technique because it understands those qualities to be operative at its most extreme margins. Yet it would also offer a model for modernist literary practice regarding the possibilities of a formalized recklessness.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>
	  Born into the ruling family of Rimini in 1418, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta’s life reads like a rap sheet of genealogical and personal violence. Commentators both in Malatesta’s time and after have been quick to emphasize the centrality of violence and depravity to Malatesta’s life and legacy, and indeed even the briefest account of Malatesta’s life finds these characteristics inescapable.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the midst of this perpetual ting, Malatesta commissioned the construction of the Tempio. As Rainey notes, romantic interpretations of the Tempio prevalent in the nineteenth century, which Pound both mimicked and fundamentally rebuked in the Malatesta Cantos, often framed its construction as a testament to dual depravities: on the one hand, Malatesta’s love for his mistress-then-wife, Ixotta, and on the other, paganism over Church beliefs.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Tempio has stood as a testament to these two forms of illegitimacy at various points in history, but the Tempio is of particular importance in the Malatesta Cantos for its position within the historical legacies of rape, pillage, and murder which accounted for its construction. For instance, in Canto IX, Pound excerpts from a letter “found in the post-bag” of Malatesta, addressed to Leon Battista Alberti, the Tempio’s chief architect, for:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>

	</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The exactitude of these orders makes them an awkward fit within the harried and often improvised scheme of Malatesta’s personal history evidenced elsewhere in the Malatesta Cantos: hiding neck deep in marsh water at the opening of Canto IX, caught “like a hen in a coop” in Ancona, and wriggling between the shifting alliances of Italian city states. Their made-to-order precision is, moreover, out of step with either the poetic form of the Malatesta Cantos or the post-bag which serves as its <span style="font-style:italic;">mise en abyme</span> in Canto IX,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as a collection of cobbled fragments. Thus the Tempio stands in unnatural relationship to the historical circumstances of its production: part of the violent and unpredictable Malatestan chronicle, yet also exceptional due to its precision and permanence. As Reed Dasenbrock puts it, “what [Pound] wanted Malatesta to show is precisely the tension or ambivalence between creativity and violence.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Yet to see nothing ambivalent or tense about the connection between creativity and violence is to see Malatesta as a kind of Renaissance battler: stigmatized as the embodiment of unrestrained vice, outside the accepted and acceptable narratives of Renaissance humanism, and seemingly bereft of method or scheme in his rape, plunder, and killing, in other words, analogous to boxing’s own threat to its social and legal legitimation narrative by being crude, violent, and exceedingly reckless. Malatesta’s violent and disreputable acts received extended attention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries</span> of Pius II, the most enduring Renaissance record of Malatesta’s life, and persisted as the core element of his reputation up to the time Pound began writing the Malatesta Cantos. Jakob Burkhardt, in his exemplary <span style="font-style:italic;">The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</span> , dismisses Malatesta with a single line, remarking on his “disinterested love of evil.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> One of the more damning passages from Pius II’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries</span>, often quoted in discussions of the Malatesta Cantos, is worth reproducing at some length for the specific character of its attack:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  He was such a slave to avarice that he was ready not only to plunder but to steal. His lust was so unbridled that he violated his daughters and his sons-in-law. When he was a lad he often played the bride and after taking the woman’s part debauched men. No marriage was sacred to him. He ravished nuns and out-raged Jewesses; boys and girls who would not submit to him he had murdered or savagely beaten. He committed adultery with many women to whose children he had been godfather and murdered their husbands. He outdid all barbarians in cruelty. His bloody hand inflicted terrible punishments on innocent and guilty alike. He oppressed the poor, plundered the rich, spared neither widows nor orphans. No one felt safe under his rule.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	As Michael F. Harper has observed, Pound’s perceived omission of this legacy had led to the dismissal for many years of the Malatesta Cantos as poor historicism, the willfully rosy portrait of a depraved power-glutton.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	It is indeed a peculiar appraisal of the Malatesta Cantos, particularly as Canto X neither omits this legacy nor downplays it, but rather reproduces exactly the crucial charges of this passage from the original Latin.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Following the authority of Giovanni Soranzo, a contemporaneous Malatesta scholar whose work did much to challenge Romantic interpretations of the Tempio, Pound suggests that Andrea del Benzi’s 1461 speech to the consistatory of Cardinals was in fact written by Pius II, and that the charges are trumped up and false. A cursory comparison between the two invectives corroborates more detailed historical scholarship that substantiates Pound’s claim: both emphasize murder, lechery, incest, and rape.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Pound’s suspicion of Benzi and Pius’s collusion isn’t identical to a rebuke of the charges, however. Rather than shying away from Malatesta’s identification with unheeded violence and lust, the Malatesta Cantos imagine them as crucial to, and at times constituting his contributions to Western culture. The presentation of these charges in Canto X is particularly significant, as it foregrounds the terms in which violence and degradation become cultural catalysts. Of the fourteen Latin epithets used to denigrate Malatesta, the middle term numerically and visually is <span style="font-style:italic;">audax</span>, “reckless one.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Audax</span> is not only the term at the numerical and visual center of the passage, but also of Malatesta himself, indicating a more abstracted idea of character than the rest of the epithets which all tie specifically to a particular act—rape, patricide, perjury, murder, etc. The passage thus confronts head-on the principal charges against Malatesta, but also identifies a core quality that organizes them into something more than a laundry list of depravity; <span style="font-style:italic;">audax</span>, in other words, proposes a rubric under which Malatesta’s personal atrocities both retain their undertones of unrepentant hedonism, and also fall under a more commodious concept of recklessness which opens a space for talking about such qualities as positive or progressive forces. For instance, after concluding the treatment of Malatesta’s indictment before the consistatory of cardinals and subsequent <span style="font-style:italic;">auto-da-fé</span>, complete with Pius’s praise of Benzi’s speech and burning ef, Pound quotes Borso d’Este as saying “the time was ill-suited / to <span style="font-style:italic;">tanta novita</span>, such doings or innovations” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 45). Again, Pound performs a similar move of translating <span style="font-style:italic;">tanta novita</span>—“such oddities”—with an emphasis on the newness and innovative nature of Malatesta’s character, its illegibility to those who would see his actions as an unregenerate cycle of illegitimate violence.
	</p>
<p>
	  One possible contention regarding the relationship between Malatesta’s scandalous biographical details and the aesthetic value of the Tempio is that Malatesta’s violence, for all its seeming insensibility, is organized, made sense of, and validated by the achievement of the Tempio. Yet the Malatesta Cantos resist this assertion, in part because violence, practiced in a certain way, can be an aesthetic in its own right. As the practical arm of building the Tempio, incessant and indiscriminate battling paradoxically restores a kind of coherence, if not connectivity, to a cultural matrix freckled by deceit, lies, and petty struggle for personal gain. In a letter to John Quinn, Pound spoke  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to the organizing power of portraying Malatesta as a seemingly disorderly individual, “I suppose one has to ‘select.’ If I find [Malatesta] was TOO bloody quiet and orderly it will ruin the canto. Which needs a certain boisterousness and disorder to contrast with his constructive work.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> As Pound’s letter suggests, his portrait of Malatesta self-consciously foregrounds his “disorderly” qualities and biographical details. It is, in other words, a disorder that registers coherently. Though Pound suggests that this “boisterousness” is antithetical to Malatesta’s more “constructive” work, the Malatesta Cantos ultimately offer a very different understanding of the relationship between disorder and aesthetic construction, one inchoate in the very form of the Malatesta Cantos themselves.
	</p>
<p>
	  Part of the boisterousness Pound discovered while doing the extensive research for the Malatesta Cantos was no doubt Malatesta’s reckless authority, which Rainey describes as “unchecked and arbitrary, his decisions ratified by no one, his choices subject to no identifiable norms or criteria.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> But part of it, as well, can be attributed to the nature of Malatesta’s chosen profession: condottiere. Though a fixture of medieval Italian warfare in certain respects, as Michael Mallett notes, “the tendency of the larger Italian state to expand and develop a more coherent and centralized political organization inevitably led to a greater emphasis on permanent defence.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> With resources traditionally oriented towards trade and finance, not war, Italian cities and provinces reckoned with the problem of a sudden need for protection by contracting armies led by condottieri. Because the relationship between warrior and city was contractually made, as opposed to feudally, the condottieri emerged as a newly professionalized kind of warrior-general, battling without specific allegiance. In the Malatesta Cantos, Pound records Malatesta’s warring in precisely these contractual terms—“Venice has taken me on again / At 7,000 a month”; “Sforza did bestialmente / as he had promised him, Sigismundo, per capitoli / to see that he, Malatesta, should have Pesaro” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 30). As a condottiere, Malatesta’s lack of intrinsic allegiance to any one ruler or city state, and indeed exploitation of this fact, meant that his ting could be the means as well as the ends of personal glory, a way of creating socio-political havoc within the very institution set up to control, order, and regulate the balance of power among Italy’s different local authorities.
	</p>
<p>
	  The similarities between the condottiere and the modern athlete have not gone unnoticed. In the introduction to his authoritative study, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Condottieri: Soldiers of Fortune</span>, Geoffrey Trease suggests,
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    If we are to attempt an analogy with modern professions, however, it might be better to compare the condottiere with the lawyer or the football-player. Each earns his livelihood by engaging in a succession of contests . . . the footballer transfers from club to club. In court or on the playing field, he faces adversaries who may have been his friends and colleagues a little while before—and who may be so again in the near future.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  As Jeffrey Sammonds and Dan Streible have each shown, by the 1920s a number of social and economic factors contributed to the emergence of boxing as an internationally popular sport, and concomitantly to the emergence of a group of professional boxers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who could rely solely on prizets and boxing exhibitions for a sizeable income.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As an emergent class of professionalized ters, modern boxers embodied the condottiere’s disinterested and highly prowessed relationship to military warfare and violence.
	</p>
<p>
	  Indeed, it was Malatesta’s disorderly agitation of Renaissance Italy’s network of alliances, marriage, and religious authority through warfare which the Malatesta Cantos often re through battling terminology and images. At times, this means the use of sporting language to describe Malatesta’s military campaigns, “and he nearly died out in Sparta, / Morea, Lakedaemon, / and came back with no pep in him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 50). But more often Malatesta is explicitly red as a battler. Canto IX, for example, records that “And [Malatesta] fought in Fano, in a street t, / and that was nearly the end of him.” Likewise, in Canto X, Pound translates a letter of advice from Count Pitigliano, “on the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, ‘Siggy darlint, wd. you not stop making war on / ‘insensible objects, such as trees and domestic vines, that have / ‘no means to hit back . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 42). These are two similar kinds of indecorousness, the first is a t at the outer limits of proper combat (both in military battles and boxing), the second an understanding of war as lacking the decency which creates boundaries between street ts and battles, men and plants. But what both testify to most loudly is the ubiquity of violence and warfare in renaissance Italy, its almost quotidian quality. The double negative in Pitigliano’s letter suggests that Malatesta’s “making war” belongs to a larger complex of militarism’s complicity in the maintenance and production of aristocratic power. In this context, the documentation of Malatesta’s violence is not about violence <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, but about the efficacy of violence to achieve particular aesthetic effects.
	</p>
<p>
	  The connection between aesthetic language and violence is one of the Malatesta Cantos’ abiding themes, and one the text approaches in different ways. It is evident in the emergence of obscenity as a constituent force in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span> which the Malatesta sequence marks—opening Canto VIII by putting “Slut” and “Bitch” in the mouths of Truth and Calliope, respectively, and labeling the Pope a son of a bitch in Canto X. As Biographer Charles Norman notes, Pound was so insistent on his epithet for Pius II that when Richard Aldington, acting as part-time editor for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, cut it out of the proofs for the periodical publication of the Malatesta Cantos, Pound “transferred the epithet to [Aldington] by mail.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> But a more direct connection between linguistic utterance and violence is encoded by athletics, and concerns their confluence in the space of performance. In Canto IX, Pound recalls a poetic contest between Basinio and Porcellio, the proposition of which is whether one can write good Latin verse without having studied Greek:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  And one year Basinio went out into the courtyard
	<br>
	    Where the lists were, and the palisades
	<br>
	    had been set for the tourneys,
	<br>
	  And he talked down the anti-Hellene
	<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 34).
	</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The “tourneys” would have been a series of athletic contests typically held in conjunction with feasts or ritual holidays, abstractions of the more real practices of early modern warfare such as jousting, archery, and wrestling, which recommend the skills  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of battle while minimizing their inherent danger. Pound’s line breaks privilege spatial awareness, enjambing its sense units such that “courtyard” and “palisades” form clear and successively clarifying visions of the location of Basinio and Porcellio, the anti-Hellene. Culminating in the image of the palisaded courtyard, such a spatial awareness emphasizes the connection between this poetic battle and Renaissance athletic tournaments. The layout of the passage on the page further foregrounds this common sense of squared enclosure, an elemental theater of contest that mimics in size and number of combatants a modern boxing match. Likewise, Basinio’s “talk[ing] down the anti-Hellene” should be recovered from the more modern sense of “talk down” as reasoning with an agitated individual, which the OED first records in 1946. Rather, Basinio’s words literally fell Porcellio, echoing aurally two more contemporaneously commonplace expressions: “takedown” and “knockdown.” In the battle of poets within the palisades, Pound envisions a more than analogical relationship between literary intellection and ting, more closely fusing the cultural function of poetic utterance and the play of violence in athletic contest: the performance of a culturally useful skill purely for the demonstration of technical merit.
      </p>
<p>
	In part, the possibility for aesthetics to be “disinterested” or purely concerned with technical merit is precisely what the re of Malatesta obliterates. One of the more familiar narratives of Pound’s career, articulated most clearly by Peter Nicholls, suggests that an early aestheticism was severely checked or repudiated by Pound amidst the confluence of personal and historical circumstances surrounding the First World War.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Hugh Selwyn Mauberly</span>, Pound’s “farewell to London” poem, marks most clearly the death of this aesthete-poet. Though Pound’s relationship to aestheticism throughout his career was complex, the Malatesta Cantos answer <span style="font-style:italic;">Mauberly</span>’s death of aestheticism with a re and aesthetic imbricated with the best and worst of the culture around it. The episode with which the battle of poets rhymes, Malatesta’s near fistt with Count Urbino in Canto X, speaks to the partial and the personal as violence’s most harnessed aesthetic valences:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	And Borso had the pair up to Bel Fiore,
      <br>
	The pair of them, Sigismundo and Federico Urbino,
      <br>
	Or perhaps in the palace, Ferrara, Sigismund upstairs
      <br>
	And Urbino’s gang in the basement,
      <br>
	And a regiment to keep the guards in, to keep order,
      <br>
	  For all the good that did:
      <br>
	“<span style="font-style:italic;">Te cavero la budella del corpo!”</span><br><span style="font-style:italic;">El conte levatosi</span>:
      <br>
	  “<span style="font-style:italic;">Io te cavero la corata a te!</span>”
      <div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 43)
      </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Malatesta’s possible fistt remains, even in Pound’s account, shrouded in an indeterminacy which aligns it with the battle of the poets in that language similarly inhabits the space of physical combat. The details of this encounter are obscured in particular ways; Pound cannot conclude definitely whether the exchange between Malatesta and Urbino happened in Ferrara or Bel Fiore. (Furthermore, as it happens, Bel Fiore is in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> fact not the name of Borso’s castle.) Nor can he keep straight the physical logistics of their t, whether upstairs or in the basement, with spectators or without. Yet in this way, violent language itself becomes the orienting device of the exchange; Malatesta’s threat to tear out the Count’s guts restores to this dislocated scene the embodiment it lacks, Urbino’s guts wrested out of his body and into the texture of the poem. The effect is to double the very work this scene does for the Malatesta Cantos at large, which shows Malatesta’s military acumen to be Malatesta’s bilious personality writ large, to be, in other words, as integral to his being as his guts. In an early appraisal of the Malatesta Cantos, Thomas Jackson suggests that “Sigismondo himself is not—cannot be—free of the disorder against which he asserts his ‘factive intellect.’”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Malatesta’s lack of “freedom” from disorder, I would submit, is as crucial as Jackson understands it to be, though substantially less vexed. Rather, the continuity between public and private personalities strengthens the place of disorder as an organizing principle for Malatesta’s actions.
    </p>
<p>
      The battle of the poets; Malatesta versus Urbino. These contrary visions of what place violence can have in an aesthetic are unified in their preference for an elemental theater of battle, a one-on-one contest that dramatizes a larger historical reality. They are indicative of a preference in the Malatesta Cantos for thinking about historical record in wholly embodied terms as the contest between two battling personae. The Malatesta Cantos demonstrate a real obliqueness about the logistics of war, such that so-and-so will “t” at such-and-such a “place,” and this kind of description suffices for what oftentimes is a major battle involving complex military formations. In Canto VIII, for example, a letter from Malatesta’s war camp, dated “<span style="font-style:italic;">aprilis 1449 contra Cremonam</span>,” stands as an historical record of a battle comprised of thousands of individuals and multiple city-state alliances. Rather than falling victim to a poor or obscurantist brand of historiography, the Malatesta Cantos suggest that history itself is this kind of essentialized narrative, an argumentative vision of what is worth cultural record.
    </p>
<p>
      The utility of violence in the life of Sigismondo Malatesta make the Malatesta Cantos not only a biting revision of accepted notions of Renaissance humanism, but also a comment on the status of the arts in post-First World War Europe. At points, this sequence about the relationship between war, violence, and cultural production comes close to the elegiac mood of certain passages in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hugh Selwyn Mauberly</span>, Pound’s most explicit meditation—though even this is an ironic ode—on the ravages of a war on those who “walked eye deep in hell / believing old men’s lies, then unbelieving / came home.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> As Canto XI moves swiftly through a series of battles conducted at Vitelleschi and Fano in which Malatesta fought papal armies for control of the region, for example, Pound records,
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
      And he went by ship to Tarentum,
    <br>
      I mean Sidg went to Tarentum
    <br>
      And he found ‘em, the anti-Aragons
    <br>
        busted and weeping into their beards
    <div class="attrib">
      (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 49).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      If Malatesta, as a rewriting of Mauberly’s dead aestheticism, represents the potential for aestheticism to be constituted by the materiality of contemporary life, it is compelling to see here the case of Pound’s own contemporaneity coloring an instance of that materiality. The lines directly incorporate battling slang into its description of these defeated soldiers. They also anticipate “the busted down pug” Ad Francis at the beginning of Hemingway’s “The Battler,” creating a similar tension through the contrast of such stasis with clear emotional turbulence: “The man looked to be alone. He was sitting there with his head in his hands looking at the fire.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Nevertheless, the pathos of this image is hardly the endpoint for either Malatesta or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>; the near-ceaseless anaphoric use of “and” in Canto XII denies any sort of pause at these moments. In calling attention to these ravages, the Malatesta Cantos offers an historical moment in which artistic and cultural production begin and end in violence, both bound up with and resistant to its obviously lethal effects. Indeed, the attempt to push dizzyingly forward in spite of social agitation is perhaps the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>’ most legible incorporation—at the level of sheer bulk—of Malatesta’s incessant urge to create.
    </p>
<p>
      The implications of this battling aesthetic for the formal features of the Malatesta Cantos—long considered the lodestone of their construction as a modernist achievement— lie in their unrelenting deployment of raw documents without apparent logic or principle, and the explicit threat which this strategy had for the idea of poetry itself. For all of Malatesta’s radical and problematic violence—conquering cities, raping children, murdering friends and enemies alike—Pound’s poetics are charged with a similar violent energy within the realm of literary discourse, an immediately registered attack on the terms and stakes of modern poetry. As Rainey notes,
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	The citation of historical documents, a procedure first adopted in the Malatesta Cantos, seems an especially intransigent form of this practice. The source texts are aggressively quotidian and antiliterary, invoking materials so alien to conventional notions of the ‘poetic’ as to reconstitute the boundaries of subject matter acceptable in poetic discourse.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Indeed, if there is one thing to note about the Malatesta Cantos it is how they amplify a tone of antagonism against existing historico-cultural records, which resonates at a sustained volume throughout the rest of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Ironically, the major component of this antagonism is not the physical violence or obscenity recorded in the Malatesta Cantos, but the formal arrangement of its sense units. If the re of the battler raises the proposition in boxing discourse that a seemingly chaotic, reckless aesthetic can, in fact, display logical coherence and method when properly looked for, the collage of the Malatesta Cantos reconceives of this proposition in literary terms. Like the courtyard of the battle of the poets in Canto IX, the Cantos are “where the lists were,” and where listing suddenly becomes an act of antagonism. Composed of the prosaic fragments of quotation from historical documents, breaking in its opening lines with high modernism’s poet most <span style="font-style:italic;">en vogue</span>, and written in a creole of Latin, English, American slang, Italian, and nonsense phrases, the Malatesta Cantos announce at every turn the newness and singularity for which literary criticism has prized  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them. Moreover, they re this newness in the terms which Pound articulated to John Quinn in 1922, as disorder and boisterousness, the selection of quotidian fragments made raucous through their seemingly chaotic deployment. Of course, the Malatesta Cantos attest quite soundly to the organizational logic of these discrete units. Yet to return to the material conditions of their production and the cultural milieu out of which they emerge is to recognize the affinity between these literarily reckless Cantos and the battlers with whom they shadowbox.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>
      On June 17, 1923, approximately one month after the Malatesta Cantos landed on T. S. Eliot’s desk for publication in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, Pound saw his sparring style reanimated professionally in a t between Battling Siki and Émile Morelle at the Velodrome d’Hiver in Paris. A Senegalese ter who six months earlier had controversially beaten Georges Carpentier for the light heavyweight world championship, Siki was a trademark battler in style: wild, unorthodox, and reckless. As biographer Peter Benson notes, depictions of him in the Parisian press often shaded these qualities with more overtly racist terminology such as “savage” or “primitive.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The t, which Pound attended with Henry Strater, Jane Heap, Robert McAlmon, and Ernest Hemingway, is a fitting capstone to the composition of the Malatesta Cantos in that Siki’s performance suggested both the creativity and the danger of boxing at its stylistic limits. In the fifth round, in defiance of the perceived one-sidedness of the officiating, Siki turned his back to Morelle, refusing to t. Siki would be disqualified in the sixth round for a low blow. Pound would later invoke the match twice in his published writing; in an unpublished letter to his father, dated June 20, 1923, Pound showcases a battler at odds with the institutional structures of ting:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	Saw Siki done out of a decision last Saturday; then a very grave polite and gentlemanly coon so determined not to let the umpire call him on a foul that he simply refrained from hitting his opponent.
      </p>
<p>
	Hem [Hemingway] had his opera glasses on Siki, s’oiseau [Bill Bird] was on the other side of the ring, and we all three had good seats, and could see NO foul. Siki very amusing, and perfectly aware that the cards were stacked.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      It is difficult to overlook the racism of Pound’s language here, though recent work by Michael Coyle and Michael North, among others, has done much to texture our sense of the origins and implications of Pound’s racial views.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> What I wish to point out here, in closing, is the way that Siki’s disqualification against Morelle, with its pervasive fatalism, throws into relief what we might call the implications of this battling aesthetic as practiced in the Malatesta Cantos for Anglo-American modernism. Part of the significance of the Morelle t for Siki’s career was that it effectively labeled him too “dangerous” or “reckless” for French boxing authorities, and led to his banishment by French boxing’s governing bodies. Thereafter, Siki’s career quickly went into a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tailspin, and in three years he would be murdered in New York over a gambling debt, penniless, drunk, and anonymous. It was, in short, the apotheosis of a career which effectively ended with that low blow in the sixth round. The Malatesta Cantos might be said to share with Siki’s 1923 t a similar sense of climax in Pound’s writing as a touchstone of significance, but their after-effect has been to solidify the importance of formal innovation in definitions of high modernism, indeed, to stake the very ground on which high modernism, unlike Siki’s career, comfortably persisted as a force in Anglo-American letters.
    </p>
<p>
      When seen for their commitments to battling discourse, however, the Malatesta Cantos belie an antagonism and disorder in their formal strategies which challenge such an instantiation, or at the very least alter the terms with which their importance can be evoked. Driven by its logic of oppositional resistance, the Malatesta Cantos dramatize the moment in which modernism’s characteristically self-conscious sense of rupture, couched in terms of formal discipline and rigor, turns inward on the fact that such an ideology had finally found itself at odds with the notions of revolt and the “new” with which it had once been freighted. In other words, the formal innovation of the Malatesta Cantos calls attention to the point at which a commitment to self-reflexivity, as practiced by other modernists, could be prioritized over the rupture and rebellion which formal commitments once represented. Pound’s adversary here, of course, is the poet with whom Pound in 1923 was most closely associated, who first published the Malatesta Cantos, and who is directly provoked in the sequence’s first line: T. S. Eliot. The Malatesta Cantos are important for literary modernism precisely for this prioritizing of havoc, rebelliousness, and superabundance over the precision, traditionalism, and careful tact which Eliot was increasingly beginning to espouse around the same time. In battling with Eliot in the pages of Cantos VIII–XI, Pound casts the lot of literary modernism not with its formal rigor and precision, but with the resonant energy of a ceaseless disruption, and an aesthetic of violence.
    </p>
<p>
      Part of the legacy of this position for Pound’s place in literary modernism, of course, has been his own marginalization, a queasy handwringing over his post-Malatesta textual output precisely because its imperatives both historically and ideologically align with Italian fascism.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Efficacy over nuance, violence over conciliation, antagonism over dialogue: these critical choices which the Malatesta Cantos signify can and have been read as an aesthetics of fascism. And while the Malatesta Cantos very much reflect this proposition, what the battler does is begin to take seriously the way that these aesthetic possibilities are very much in the air in the years after the First World War at a moment when they need not seem wholly fascist, indeed, when they might seem to be—in the fullest sense of the idiom—all the rage. The Malatesta Cantos’ absorption of battler discourse, their deployment of battling terminology and images, and the mediation of the aesthetic valences of violence by this commitment, recovers an interesting moment in Pound’s career because the qualities which later become so associated with fascism in Pound’s writing are revealed to have an alternative genealogy. But the Malatesta Cantos also have implications for literary modernism more generally for the ways that, as glimpsed in the snippet of boxing discourse covered in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this essay, they share an interest in the productively fuzzy line between literary and boxing discourses reflected in the work of other modernists such as Wyndham Lewis, Ford Madox Ford, and Jack London. As the informing aesthetic of the Malatesta Cantos, boxing does not negate the text’s commitments to fascism, but rather suggests ways of talking about those shared aesthetic valences as part of a larger conversation in Anglo-American modernism about the constellation of violence and form, disorder and revitalization, aesthetics and mass appeal, for which fascism has perhaps too long functioned as a tropological default.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Malatesta Cantos, Pound envisions a moment in which reckless violence and the creative environment of chaos are the constituent fabric of the arts, both Malatesta’s Tempio and his own. Years later, in 1945, in the qualitatively different chaos of an open-air, six-by-six foot steel cage at the Detention Training Center at Pisa, Pound scribbled the drafts of Canto 74, and shadowboxed for exercise. As the Malatesta Cantos suggest, the link between these two practices had been formulated far earlier, a matter of ideological import as well as practical necessity for the fate of literary modernism.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  In the early 1920s, the film industry seized on the furor over the modern girls’ demands for sexual liberty and fulfillment inside and outside of marriage to introduce not only new subject matter, but new modes of addressing its diverse audience. Social upheaval in this period coincided with the media industries’ movement toward unprecedented speed of adaptation and cooperation, making possible a powerful new intermediality. The film industry used this to generate layered meanings beyond the confines of the film text, encouraging bold viewers to see through the camouflage with which it sought to appease more traditionalist audience members. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, through a smokescreen of melodramatic conventions and moral lessons, it delivered a strikingly modern conception of sexuality and marriage to the big screen.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
      In November 1923, First National Pictures released a film adaptation of a scandalous bestselling novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, in which three upper-class sisters flout the conventions of proper courtship and girlish chastity held dear by the previous generation. The novel presents the sisters as examples of the revolution in sexual behavior of the modern girl happening in the United States and around the world. Record crowds flocked to the theater to see the wild partying, nudity, and sex of the book brought to life on screen.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, texts such as these were under close scrutiny for the effect that they might have on their audiences’ behavior. While they capitalized on public fascination and fears about the modern girl, they also developed strategies to tell such stories in ways that shielded them from censorship and excessive public outcry. Filmmakers were under even greater constraints than popular authors when it came to what they could portray.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not surprisingly, the film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> had to rework and tame the story for the cinematic context, but the contents of the novel were still a powerful presence in the film text. Indeed, the production history of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> demonstrates that the strategies which the film industry employed when adapting such a text encouraged considerable intermediality. Through its production and exhibition context, the film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> offered audiences the opportunity to read the film through the lens of the novel’s more controversial and modern vision of sexuality and marriage.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> is a virtual catalog of the strategies the film industry employed in this period to handle problematic modern  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> material. In adapting the novel, relatively little controversial material was cut outright. Most of its notorious incidents were rendered through a variety of cinematic techniques of atmosphere, performance, and implication, including shooting in silhouette, using editing to elide certain events, and leaving out intertitles for some of the characters’ spoken dialog (i.e. allowing viewers to lip-read some portions of dialog). The film version was also given an ending that provided a much stronger moral lesson than that of the novel, in order to justify its many shocking incidents.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      While the film adaptation camouflaged or moralized the novel’s incidents, it also made connections to the more daring novel both within the film text and through promotional materials. “Sensation-seeking” viewers were encouraged to play a game of filling in the blanks based on their knowledge of the novel and of modern mores in general. More sensitive or old-fashioned members of the audience were offered a viewing position that made plausible a more conservative interpretation of the film’s events. The strategy was only partially successful at shielding the film from censorship troubles. Literary adaptations pushed motion picture content beyond acceptable boundaries; indeed the initial focus of the Motion Picture Producers &amp; Directors Association (MPPDA) was on regulating the adaptation of potentially inflammatory literary works. However, <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>’s tremendous financial success ensured that it would be an influential model for later films.
    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> came to be identified as the film that launched the flapper film cycle and its star, Colleen Moore, was credited as the originator of the screen flapper (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>).<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The film established the formula and pushed the cycle to the forefront of Hollywood production. Writing about Colleen Moore’s 1924 film <span style="font-style:italic;">The Perfect Flapper</span>, Louella Parsons said, “You cannot find the word ‘flapper’ in the dictionary, but you can find it in nine out of ten comedies. Next to talk of breaking the Volstead Act I am convinced that the flapper is the most popular movie subject today.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The flapper film maintained enormous popularity throughout the decade, and gave Hollywood a new modern female type that combined the previously contradictory elements of youth, innocence, and sexuality. <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> can rightly be considered to be among the foundational films for the portrayal of modern women on the screen. A case study of the adaptation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> yields insight into how filmmakers were able to negotiate a place for this popular but controversial re.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rapid Adaptation, Intermediality, and the Modern Girl</h1>
<p>
	The context in which audiences viewed the film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> was shaped by the new practice of rapid adaptation of novels. The trend also encompassed other popular works such as plays and short stories, taking advantage of the notoriety of these works before it had a chance to fade. A pre-sold title had been a vital part of selling films almost since the beginning of the industry, but in the early 1920s the increase in cooperation between film producers and other media industries gave rise to new mutual marketing strategies. Though a variety of works were adapted in this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> period, the attention garnered by works that focused on the conduct of the modern girl made them a natural choice for rapid adaptation. The stories of the emblematic chronicler of modern youth, F. Scott Fitzgerald, were among the numerous properties adapted from magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Redbook</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">McClure’s</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ladies Home Journal</span>, and especially the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span> in the early 1920s, and throughout the decade.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Fitzgerald’s stories “Myra Meets His Family,” “Head and Shoulders,” and “The Offshore Pirate” were adapted as flapper comedies within months of their appearance in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span>.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>
	The explosion and cross-fertilization of such stories across a variety of media in the early years of the 1920s is thus an important context for the release of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>. More particularly, however, changes in the interaction of the film and publishing industries would shape the way that the film was presented to the public. Practices such as the advance sale of the movie rights of novels and the release of photoplay editions or novelizations of motion picture stories simultaneously with the showing of the film became widespread in this period. Trade publications for both industries encouraged booksellers and theaters to cooperate in their marketing practices, enhancing the intermedial environment for the reception of novels and films in the process.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	In June 1923, <span style="font-style:italic;">Publisher’s Weekly</span> singled out three bestsellers, <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Oxen</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Cordelia the Magnificent</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, all addressing issues of generational conflict and/or modern youth, as examples of the trend towards rapid adaptation of novels:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  In the past screen versions of popular books usually appeared at least two years after the publication of the book. Now the picture productions are being released within a few months after the book has attained popularity and publicity. Conspicuous examples of this new development are the picture versions now being filmed of “Black Oxen” by First National Pictures, Leroy Scott’s “Cordelia the Magnificent,” by Metro, and Warner Fabian’s “Flaming Youth,” which will be directed by Jack Dillon.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued"><span style="font-style:italic;">Manslaughter</span> , Cecil B. DeMille’s adaptation for Paramount of the 1921 Alice Duer Miller novel of the same name, about a jazz mad society girl who kills a police officer with her roadster, provides another example. <span style="font-style:italic;">Publisher’s Weekly</span> pointed out the opportunities for cross-promotion that rapid adaptation created for bookstores. “No bookseller can ignore the theater in these days. . . . Be ready . . . “Manslaughter” as a popular copyright and as a movie came out on about the same date in several cities. It was a sad oversight on the bookseller’s part if he didn’t sell well on the book.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A photoplay edition of a novel, which included images from the film version and often an endorsement by its star, went still further in merging the products of publishers and film producers. For example, in January 1923, <span style="font-style:italic;">Publisher’s Weekly</span> noted the release of the photoplay edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Prodigal Daughters</span>, a Joseph Hocking flapper novel, prior to the release of the film. The photoplay edition included an introduction “written” by the film’s star, Gloria Swanson. <span style="font-style:italic;">Publisher’s Weekly</span> reported that Famous Players-Lasky was giving “unusual emphasis to the bookselling possibilities of the tieup” in its promotional campaign for <span style="font-style:italic;">Prodigal Daughters</span>:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The company has sent copies of the book to all of its branch offices with instructions to use them in getting window displays in connection with the local showing of the picture. The producers are also furnishing the publisher and booksellers the dates of whatever advance bookings that have been arranged (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>). In addition to all this the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation is running articles about the book and film in newspapers and trade magazines. There will be a concentrated, country-wide campaign of publicity and advertising just before the general release date—April 15.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	Putting books and films before the audience at or near the same time and creating photoplay editions did more than simply generate mutual advertising. It also encouraged a closer association of the content of the two forms of a story. One result was that film producers could take advantage of the greater latitude accorded to written works in their exploration of the controversies surrounding the modern girl. Warner Bros.’ adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> , released in January 1923, provides a good example. The company played upon the reputation of the book and its author and exaggerated how daring the film was in its marketing, borrowing the novel’s atmosphere of modernity while playing it safer with the film itself.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	In its very first season, the infant producer Warner Bros. put the adaptation of modern novels and stage plays at the center of its strategy with seven carefully chosen films based on high profile recent works.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Their second release of the seven was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span>, which chronicled the degeneration of a flapper and her profligate young husband. Following his electrifying debut novel <span style="font-style:italic;">This Side of Paradise</span>, Fitzgerald’s widely anticipated second novel was both a critical and commercial success, and was serialized in <span style="font-style:italic;">Metropolitan</span> magazine.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
	“Just how wild a wild party can be is shown in this picture, presenting a contrast between the upright puritanical ways of the older generation and the giddiness of the new,” the press sheet promised.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, the novel’s explicit incidents and morally ambiguous tone presented a problem for the film version. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Photoplay</span> review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> noted how the film tamed the story. It gave high praise to Fitzgerald, calling him “the historian of the modes and manners of our day.” “If he depicts life as a series of petting parties, cocktails, mad dancing and licker-on-the-hip, it is because he sees our youthful generation in these terms.” The review complains, however, that much of Fitzgerald’s vision of the complex glamour and menace of modern youth has been boiled down to a moral message of regeneration in the film version. It concludes, however, that “all the mechanics of passable direction can not dull the edge of Fitzgerald’s fresh viewpoint.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Warner Bros. was certainly at pains to give its film the aura of Fitzgerald’s viewpoint, even if the content of the novel was inevitably watered down. As with its six other releases that season, it used the notoriety of the author to pre-sell <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> to distributors and played up Fitzgerald’s name in advertising and promotion. Its press sheet for the film proclaimed, “no novel published within the past few years has created as much discussion as ‘The Beautiful and Damned,’” and further asserted that “Fitzgerald’s name is a household word.” In a feature on publicity stunts for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span>, the exhibitors’ trade magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> reported that publicity for the film would make use of “many angles of publicity linking the name of F. Scott Fitzgerald, conceded to be one of the most popular of present day authors.” Among the reported exploitation accessories were doorknob hangers, stickers, and heralds featuring “the exact reproduction of cover design (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>) on the book.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Beyond this, Warner Bros. explicitly played on the salacious incidents in the novel. One pressbook article seems to imitate Fitzgerald’s writing style, promising that the film will reveal “wicked old New York, its unsavory dives, its white lights, its cafes and cabarets . . . cruel streets thronged with sharpers, criminals, adventurers, and demi mondaines, where harlot and virgin jostle each other, where clerk and millionaire rub elbows, where beggars gaze enviously at the gorgeous splendor of diamonded overdressed ladies.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Several advertisements reproduced pages from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span> that recount its most risqué incidents. Simulated holes “torn” into the pages abruptly interrupt especially interesting passages, with stills from the film inserted in their place, as if to suggest that the film would fill in the gaps. The reverse may in fact have occurred, as audiences were encouraged to fill in what could not be presented on screen with contextual knowledge of Fitzgerald and his novel.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Though it did not have the literary credentials or famous author of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> had much in common with Fitzgerald’s novel. Initially released on 25 January 1923, it too was serialized in <span style="font-style:italic;">Metropolitan Magazine</span>, gained even greater commercial success and provoked more controversy, and was adapted as a film within a year of its release.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> The publisher of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, Boni and Liveright (B&amp;L), was known for courting controversy as a way to sell its novels, and for being at the forefront of bold new marketing strategies. Its techniques included assertive advertising both in print and in new venues such as billboards, cooperation and cross-promotion with the film industry, and employment of the brand new techniques of public relations. These strategies created a buzz of interest and controversy around the novel that carried over to the film release. As Warner Bros. did for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span>, First National used the reputation of the novel to create interplay between the two texts that opened up broader reading positions for the audience than those provided by the film alone.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“His Kind of Baby”: <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, The Novel</h1>
<p>
	The name Warner Fabian was a pseudonym for Samuel Hopkins Adams, the famous magazine muckracker and later writer of the story on which <span style="font-style:italic;">It Happened One Night</span> was based. The true authorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> was a closely guarded secret until 1947, in part, he later claimed, because he had based it on the diary of a young friend, but also clearly to protect his reputation. He realized that <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> would be a controversial and critically dubious work. “I knew it was a book that could make a helluva lot of money,” he later said, “but I didn’t want my name on it.” According to Adams scholar Samuel V. Kennedy III, Adams/Fabian brought <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> to B&amp;L rather than his usual publisher, Houghton Mifflin “probably because the Boston firm would not have touched it.” By contrast, the book was a perfect fit for Boni and Liverights’ sensational catalogue of radical political tracts, Freudian sexual theory, modernist literature, and racy bestsellers. Bennet Cerf, who came to work with Liveright in 1923, said “Flaming Youth was his kind of baby—a book about the flapper age.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The novel generated as much money as controversy, going through sixteen printings in 1923 in spite of critical pans and general outrage over its contents. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookman</span> said, “Indubitably ‘Flaming Youth,’ though honest is shocking. We do not like it. It shocks <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span>.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>
	This reaction is not surprising, given that Adams used the Fentriss family to explore numerous areas of tension regarding changing modern sexuality. These included premarital “petting” and sex, the ideology of free love, the existence of lesbian sexual desire, the expectation of both emotional and sexual satisfaction in marriage, sexual infidelity, and the rights of wives to control their sexuality and have access to abortion. Other activities of modern youth that the novel portrays, such as dating and partying outside the home, drinking, and consumption of the burgeoning modern media were suspect not only in their own right, but also because of their links to these changing patterns of sexual behavior.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	As radical as these behaviors may have seemed, however, <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> explores them all without abandoning an underlying ideological certainty that true happiness comes from monogamous heterosexual marriage. The correctness of the girls’ behavior is ultimately measured by the impact on their marital success, which in turn is measured not by the social suitability of the match, but by their emotional and sexual compatibility with their chosen mates. As Stephanie Coontz has argued of marriage in this period, “. . . because the progress of industrialization and democratization had weakened the political and economic constraints forcing people to get and stay married, such deep intimacy was now seen as the best hope for stability in marriage.” Coontz continues, “living ‘happily ever after’ without outside constraints meant that people had to reach greater depths of emotional and physical intimacy than had been possible (or necessary) in the past. . . . Good sex, the experts argued, was the glue needed to hold marriages together now that patriarchy had lost its force.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Greater sexual openness before and during marriage, the novel hints, might contribute to the achievement of marital happiness. However, it also expresses powerful fears about the difficulties of sustaining monogamy in the face of the temptations that resulted from this openness.
      </p>
<p>
	The Fentriss family not only shreds Victorian standards of behavior, it provides a rather pessimistic view of modern marital felicity. The family members are watched over by their personal physician, Dr. “Bobs” Osterhaut, who carries a torch for Mona, the mother of the family. When the story opens, Osterhaut has diagnosed Mona with a fatal illness from which she dies about a quarter of the way through the novel. Her husband, Ralph, oblivious to his wife’s illness, openly entertains young girls in their home and visits his mistress in New York. Mona has had lovers of her own, and has been something of a “flapper mother” to her three girls, to whom she is more a friend than a revered matriarch. “The trouble with me,” she tells Osterhaut, “is that I was born too soon. I really belong with this wild young age that’s coming on the stage just as I’m going off; with the girls.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Mona leaves behind three daughters who have a “strong magnetism for men” and have been indulged in their wild ways (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 174). The girls smoke, drink, and throw wild jazz parties. In the absence of parental restraint, they get their misguided ideas about how to behave from novels, movies, and scandal sheets like <span style="font-style:italic;">Town Topics</span>, and they speak frankly about sex in their youthful slang. They not only neck with their assorted boyfriends but tease and control them by means of their sexual allure. Each sister has characteristics of a particular type of modern girl and each has her own shocking trajectory.
      </p>
<p>
	Constance, who is twenty-two at the start of the novel, is “the beauty”; seductive and “heavy lashed.” Early in the novel, she gets drunk at a party and spends the night in a man’s room. Afterwards, she says, “anything might have happened,” as she has suffered a black-out (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 51). She marries the man, Fred, shortly after, and his drinking and lack of money and her profligate spending soon trouble their marriage. She begins a romance with Cary Scott, an old flame of her mother’s, who is also married, but he is ultimately seduced away from her by her more interesting little sister, Patricia.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Mary Delia, or Dee, is “the athlete,” described as self-assured, browned, and tall. She repeatedly states her lack of interest in men, considers it a “rotten nuisance” that they want to kiss her, and ask her mother if this makes her “abnormal” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 65 and 90). The hint of her lesbianism is never fully explored, however, and she falls in love with an electrician named Stanley whose family has lost all of their money. Dee is the center of one of the most talked about incidents in the novel, when a group of partiers take advantage of a power outage to do some co-ed skinny-dipping. She is shamed when Stanley arrives and fixes the lights just in time to see her walking naked towards the pool. Stanley stills loves her in spite of her transgression, but with the example of Constance’s unhappy marriage in front of her, she marries a rich man, Jimmy, instead. Jimmy reneges on an agreement that they can be husband and wife in name only, and Dee refers to their marriage as “White slave stuff, on the respectable side!,” indicating that he forces her to have sex (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 225). To her disgust she becomes pregnant, and, with little sister Pat’s help, she has a dangerous illegal abortion. She later makes plans to run away with Stanley. However, when Jimmy is crippled trying to save a child from a car accident, she stands by him, refusing to leave with Stanley in spite of her love for him.
      </p>
<p>
	Patricia is the most truly flapperish of the three girls. At the novel’s beginning, she is an awkward, outspoken fifteen year old, flat chested and bobbed haired, with “the passion of rhythmic movement in her blood” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 36). Early on, she sneaks out of her room into a jazzy party at the Fentriss home and has her first ardent kiss. It is the first of her many “petting parties” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 58) and she comes to have a reputation as a “tease” of “precarious virginity” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 99). Her sexual experimentation comes to a climax when she has premarital sex with Cary Scott. The scene is written elliptically and euphemistically, but the fact that they have become lovers is indicated repeatedly and very clearly after the fact. Pat is not “ruined” by having sex, nor is she remorseful. Immediately afterward she “pants” that “‘I’m <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> sorry! I’m not! I’m not! I’m <span style="font-style:italic;">glad</span>!’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 246).
      </p>
<p>
	Scott loves her and vows to leave his wife for her, but she declares that she is not ready to marry. She takes up with a bohemian violinist, Leo Stenak, who doesn’t believe in marriage, and plans to run off with him to Boston, but changes her mind about “slumming” with the unkempt musician at the last minute. She next becomes engaged to a young football player from her “own set,” but breaks the engagement when she realizes that she is in love with Cary Scott. Cary returns to her, and she questions him about whether her experimentation with other men has any impact on his love for her. He assures her that, even if she had gone through with the affair with Stenak, it would have had no effect on his devotion to her. The novel’s last lines encapsulate its ambivalent attitude regarding the consequences of the new sexuality. Given her earlier resistance to marriage, Cary offers Patricia a one-month trial marriage to make sure that they are compatible. Pat replies, “‘Let’s make it twenty years instead of a month. But, oh, Cary darling!’ Her eyes darkened, brooded, dreamed, grew somber, subtle, prophetic as she gave voice to her warning. ‘As a husband you’ll have to be a terribly on-the-job lover. There are so many men in the world!’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 336).
      </p>
<p>
	It is notable that Pat was widely accepted as a sympathetic heroine in spite of her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seductive behavior that, in other contemporaneous texts, might be treated as vampish. An important device in this regard is the repeated assertion of the innocence and naturalness that motivates her actions in spite of her frank sexuality. It is also important that she ultimately relinquishes most of her modern ideas in favor of conventional marriage, in spite of her half joking warning to Scott to keep her satisfied. These strategies of suggesting the flapper’s underlying innocence and providing a moral ending were key to subsequent representations of the flapper both in print and on film.
      </p>
<p>
	Another narrative device that shields <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> is the character of physician “Bobs” Osterhaut, who serves as the voice of moral indignation over the girls’ behavior. Mona, who is a believer in spiritualism, makes him promise to write letters to her after her death, telling her about the girls. In the letters, which provide readers with periodic exposition, he details his concerns about the girls’ conduct. He also occasionally confronts them when they “go too far,” as when Pat helps Dee to obtain her abortion. Osterhaut also seems to speak with the authority of the author, as the ficticious Warner Fabian is also identified as a family physician and the books’ foreword implies that he is disguising the identity of actual patients.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The novel opens with a scathing (and titillating) indictment of the excesses of the modern woman written from the perspective of this fictitious doctor.
      </p>
<p>
	This device of portraying Fabian as a doctor making a moral commentary on the girls’ behavior was also employed in the marketing campaign by Boni and Liveright. The ads for <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> list the shocking attributes that the novel ascribes to the modern girl, and then state, “Everyone is asking, WHO IS WARNER FABIAN who thus indicts woman?”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The novel thus offers reading positions for both identification with and condemnation of the Fentrisses’ behavior. That the novel gives a happy ending to an unabashed and unrepentant Patricia, however, is a strong indication that condemnation was by no means its dominant impulse, a fact that no doubt contributed to the shocked reaction that it generated.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“It’s Not As Bad as the Book”: <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, The Film</h1>
<p>
	First National promptly snapped up <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> for adaptation, correctly anticipating that its notoriety would translate to success at the box office. As a <span style="font-style:italic;">Wid’s Weekly</span> review stated, “With this title and the word-of-mouth discussion that has developed around a racy book of this type, you certainly can re on plenty of business with this.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> delivered. The film did record business at many theaters, and it appeared on several lists of top box office performers for 1923 and 1924. It was named number two of ten “Outstanding Box Office Attractions” for 1923 by <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> and appeared among distributors’ lists of the “10 Best Box Office Titles” for two years running.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> More importantly for First National, it gave the company an exceedingly valuable commodity in the form of the first true flapper star.
      </p>
<p>
	First National was star hungry in 1923, particularly for the kind of star that would bring in young audiences. The production company was formed in 1917 by a group of key exhibitors as a way to expand their business vertically and thereby break Paramount/Famous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Players-Lasky’s stranglehold on production, which was largely based on its roster of the biggest stars. First National lured Charlie Chaplin away from Mutual in 1917 and Mary Pickford from Famous Players-Lasky in 1918, and went on obtaining prime producing and acting talent over the next several years.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> However, as it continued to expand production in the early 1920s, it lost a number of top stars, including Chaplin and Pickford, who left for United Artists when their contracts were up in 1922.
      </p>
<p>
	At the time, Colleen Moore was an up-and-coming featured player with a gift for comic performance who lacked a distinctive star persona. The industry’s flirtation with the flapper character over the preceding two years had built to the point that Paramount was willing to cast a major star like Gloria Swanson in a flapper role in <span style="font-style:italic;">Prodigal Daughters</span>, but as yet no one had made the flapper character their own.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Moore’s casting as a winsome version of the flapper allowed her to do just that. With her new “Dutch bob,” Moore had a modern look to match her modern role. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Post</span> reported that “Miss Moore as Pat has the role of the most modern of flappers—cynical, sophisticated, frank, and daring. This is an entirely different characterization from anything Miss Moore has done before.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> launched Moore’s rapid ascent to the top of the box office, so that by 1926 she was the top performing female star.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> First National’s interests were thus not simply to exploit <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> for a one time profit, but to use it to launch a new star. Moore’s later success relied upon keeping the star and her characters sympathetic to a wide variety of audience members. From the beginning, First National found strategies to balance Moore’s star persona between “modern” and “innocent.” Among these was the use of intermediality to make her films suggest more than they actually showed.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Not even Colleen Moore’s genius for imbuing the flapper’s “naughty” behavior with an aura of innocence could have made Patricia Fentriss, as portrayed in the novel, acceptable for the screen incarnation of the story. Based on surviving materials, the film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> toned down the events of the novel and reworked them using strategies distinctive to cinema.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Interestingly, however, the only major events of the novel that were completely eliminated were Jimmy’s marital rape of Dee and her subsequent abortion, which do not appear in any extant version of the film adaptation. The studio synopsis still indicates that Pat is “notorious in her set because of her promiscuity,” that she refuses Scott’s first offer of marriage on the grounds that it “will spoil romance,” and that Leo Stenak “asks all that love implies without marriage.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Other controversial incidents, such as Connie and Fred’s premarital night together and Dee’s affair with Stanley, remain in implied and/or vestigial forms or are given different emphases.
      </p>
<p>
	Despite this toning down, the film version used various strategies to evoke associations with the more daring novel. The shooting script has the film opening with an expository title that is a shortened version of the provocative diatribe against modern women that opens the novel. This is followed by the main title, which is described as follows: “Title superimposed over the cover, or one of the front pages of Flaming Youth.” The shooting script also indicates the filmmakers’ intentions to suggest with atmosphere and characterization what they could not show explicitly. For example,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> passages of scene and character description in the first two pages of the shooting script include: “Introducing Ralph Fentriss and characterizing him as indifferent to the fact that he’s married”; “Nothing of dissipation, in the sense of the word —actual drunkenness—here; but youth and vitality capable of absorbing a lot and showing it only in flushed faces and half-closed eyes (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). The liquor and rhythm of the dance has worked upon their temperaments variously”; and simply, “Get over atmosphere of Flaming Youth at a party.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In addition to creating the general atmosphere suggested by the novel, the filmmakers had to decide how to handle the novel’s well-known incidents. The notorious skinny-dipping scene followed an interesting path. It is absent from the shooting script, but appears in the surviving portion of the film print, and in fact is the subject of considerable stylistic emphasis. Though the reason for the absence of such an important scene from the shooting script can only be the subject of speculation in the absence of further information, this may indicate some degree of hesitation about including this scene in the film version.
      </p>
<p>
	As it exists in the surviving print, Dee is not the center of the scene, as she is in the novel, nor are any of the Fentriss girls directly involved. Pat attends the party at which the swim takes place, but she becomes alarmed at the escalating wildness of the guests and asks her companion to take her home before the actual skinny-dipping occurs. Her behavior here is quite inconsistent with that of Pat in the novel, who is portrayed as fearlessly modern and at the heart of every bit of revelry. With the protagonist/star thus distanced from the skinny-dipping, it is further buffered by stylistic choices that render the scene ambiguous. A picture title that opens the scene shows res in silhouette jumping into a pool, which might serve to alert those familiar with the novel that the nude swim is in the offing. After some further scenes of drunken partying, a young man says in a dialog title, “I vote to light up the swimming pool and take a plunge—any way we like!” The partiers are then shown in silhouette and from a distance, casting aside their clothes, cavorting wildly around the pool and leaping in. Without knowledge of the novel, it is not clear that a viewer of the scene would necessarily identify the implied nudity.
      </p>
<p>
	Similarly, Pat’s premarital sex with the married Cary Scott, which is explicit in the novel, is only implied in the film version. Based on the shooting script, the film uses the familiar device of an ellipsis to imply the sex act.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In a scene set on the porch of the Fentriss home, Cary is alone with Pat, who is described as wearing a “silk, clinging, lounging robe.” Shot 507 in the shooting script runs as follows: “Cary clinches (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>) his fists—tries his best to resist her—slowly comes toward her. Her arms go up over his shoulders. He clasps her passionately to him. His lips find hers.” A fade out to the passionate playing of the violinist Leo Stenak marks an ellipsis, after which we return to find Cary expressing his regret that he is not free to marry Pat.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> There is a similar ellipsis in the novel, so that the actual act of sex is not described. However, the novel confirms what has occurred between the two through later repeated and clear references to Pat and Cary having been lovers.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>

<p>
	In the novel, Pat also confesses that she is not a virgin to her fiancé Monty. In a parallel scene in the shooting script, in which Pat asks Monty about his past, the implication of Pat and Cary’s affair, though present, is more oblique, and requires lip reading on the part of the audience to fill in all the blanks. Monty admits that there has “been someone else” and Pat states that there has been for her, too. The shooting script indicates that Monty replies to her, but without a dialog title, “You don’t mean— My God, Pat!” and that Pat nods her head. At his outraged reaction, her subsequent dialog title states, “Do you mean to tell me that what’s all right for you is all wrong for me—that you expect me to forgive you when you wouldn’t forgive me?”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Relying on lip-reading for a bit of Monty’s most telling dialog is a fairly thin disguise for what has passed between the two. Unlike the novel, however, the scene does leave the question of what exactly it means that there has “been someone else” up to the imagination of the viewer, even if not much imagination is required.
      </p>
<p>
	One of the most significant changes from the novel with regard to sexual politics and narrative structure is the handling of Pat’s near affair with Leo Stenak. In neither version does she go through with her intention to “run away” with the passionate free love advocate. In the novel, however, her decision is made at the last minute as she pulls into the train station in Boston and sees Stenak waiting on the platform. She changes her mind not on moral grounds, but because she suddenly sees him as “uncouth” and “greasy” compared with the immaculate and classy Cary Scott. On a whim, instead of getting off the train to keep their rendezvous, she simply remains on the train and returns home (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 293–94).
      </p>
<p>
	The film version, again as indicated in the shooting script, moves the affair with Stenak to the end of the story and recasts it as a typical episode of virtue under threat  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> by a sexual predator in the grand tradition of cinematic melodrama. Stenak persuades Pat to go for a cruise on a friend’s yacht. Once he has her at sea, he asks her to “steal away to a land where there are no laws and rules and things—where we can be free!” Pat becomes frightened and struggles with Stenak, who grabs her and kisses her. Breaking free, she locks herself in a stateroom. He begins to chop down the door with an axe, at which point Pat “falls to her knees on the floor in the attitude of prayer.” In terror, she finally climbs through a porthole, swims away, and is rescued by a boatman.
      </p>
<p>
	Her swim and her loss of “the will to live” bring on a brain fever, from which she is only rescued by the return of Cary Scott. The shooting script ends with the final line of the novel, in which Pat warns Scott that he’ll have to be a “terribly on the job lover.” The line is given an entirely different tone, however, by the preceding melodramatic scene. The affair with Stenak, rather than being one of the protagonist’s passing romances, serves to punish Pat for her transgression and teach her a lesson before she is rescued by true love and brought back into the family fold. As with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and Damned</span>, the film version removes much of the moral flexibility of the novel and requires that the heroine undergo a marked redemption. Though both the novel and the shooting script end with the promise of a conventional marriage, the shooting script thus leaves a much stronger impression of a moral lesson than the novel.
      </p>
<p>
	There is, however, one more level of meaning generated for the adaptation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> that must be considered in assessing the reading position offered to audiences for the film version of this story. Promotion for <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> provided First National and the film’s exhibitors with further opportunities to open up intermedial play with the novel. In some cases they provided additional encouragement to those audience members who knew the novel to fill in the gaps with regard to the Fentriss sisters’ illicit activities, perhaps dampening the effectiveness of the moral lesson at the film’s end (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>).
      </p>
<p>
	The most often repeated visual element in promotion of the film, used in advertisements, posters, and billboards, evokes the notorious skinny-dipping scene. It shows an (apparently) nude female re in silhouette about to enter the water. Interestingly, this suggests the narrative situation of the novel, in which Dee is caught in the nude about to enter the pool, rather than that of the film, which removes the sisters from the scene and shifts the focus to a group of anonymous skinny-dippers. Some theaters, such as the Majestic Theater in Lacrosse, Wisconsin, found the image to be too daring for their audiences and declined to use it. The Metropolitan theater in Atlanta went to the other extreme, putting up a 17 by 35 foot sign with the nude silhouette, in black against a red and yellow ground. The manager reported long queues due to the fact that “a lot of people thought it was a scene from the play.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> The Latchis Theater in Keene Vermont evoked the novel’s use of the family doctor as a voice of authority and condemnation in its advertisements for the film. It ran ads stating that city officials found the film to be of moral benefit, and included in the text of the ad a Doctor’s “Warning to Flappers.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Mutual product placement in <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Oxen</span>, another First National Adaptation of a B&amp;L title, also encouraged viewers to make connections between the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> films and their originating texts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, Colleen Moore, as Pat, is seen reading a prominently displayed copy of the novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Oxen</span> in one scene. The Wid’s Weekly review noted that the film “registered a very good ad for another First National picture, ‘Black Oxen,’ when Colleen was shown virtually ‘eating it up.’”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Clara Bow’s flapper character in the film version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Oxen</span> is in turn shown reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, and later clutches it defiantly to her chest as her old-fashioned grandmother scolds her for her wild behavior.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

	Other exploitation strategies called more explicitly for audiences to create associations through knowledge of the book. The Strand Theater in Milwaukee placed a large book against the box office rail, with the advice “not to open the book and read page 305 unless a shock was desired.” Page 305 of the initial edition of the novel involves a conversation between Pat and Dr. Osterhaut about her sexual encounter with Cary and her refusal to marry him.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> held up this strategy as an example for other exhibitors to emulate. It reported that, “Of course there was no page 305 in the display and the curious had to hurry off to some book store and get a copy of the story and having gone to all that trouble, most of them were firmly sold on the idea of seeing the play on the screen as well.” Those who went to the trouble of pursuing this lead were also certain to interpret Pat’s relationship with Cary as a sexual one. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> article advised that exhibitors should consider carefully whether this “‘shocking’ angle” was best for their house, but added that it would be sure to sell tickets.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	An exploitation manager in Orlando, Florida frankly described the role of audience awareness of the novel in selling the film. He stated that, “Flaming Youth is a wonderful box office attraction if advertised truthfully. It is not as bad as the book, but people think it will be, so advertise it that way and they will come and the picture is good enough to send them away satisfied.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> added, “In other words, the sensation seekers will think that the statement that the story has been modified is camouflage and will come, but the manager has his fingers crossed and they can’t kick.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> This revealing comment indicates that <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> credited “sensation seekers” among the audience with a rather sophisticated understanding of the game that the film industry was playing in attempting to have their sensation and hide it, too.
      </p>
<p>
	Ultimately, their game was a mixed success when it came to <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>. By turning the explicit events of the novel into implication and atmosphere, adding some elements of old school melodrama and a moral lesson, and relying on audience knowledge of the novel to fill in any gaps, First National made it somewhat harder for the censorious to point their fingers at the film. However, many reviewers and, the evidence suggests, general audience members as well, weren’t convinced of the film’s innocence. The Seattle Board of Theatre Censors took the extreme position, arresting theater manager Leroy V. Johnson on a charge of “exhibiting a motion picture of objectionable nature,” for showing the film.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The gap between the film’s incidents and its “moral” ending was not lost on many viewers, and much of their attitude toward the film depended on which of these was given greater weight. For example, the Isis Theater in Houston, Texas ran advanced screenings of the film for censors and citizens’ groups. <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> reported, “The censors saw nothing objectionable in the picture, since they looked for the lesson, but the head of a local society said it was naughty-naughty, since he saw only the incidents.” Playing on the controversy as a selling point, “the theater paralleled the opinions in the newspaper advertising and left it to the public. . . .”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In New Brunswick, New Jersey, according to the New Brunswick <span style="font-style:italic;">Home News</span>, “showing of the motion picture, ‘Flaming Youth,’ starring Colleen Moore, at a local theatre has provoked a storm of protest.” The reception of the film there crystallizes two possible reactions on the part of the older generation. The members of a local women’s club were given a private showing of the film prior to its public exhibition and were scandalized, declaring that “it is not a fit picture for young people to see.” However, the Mayor of New Brunswick, who also attended the screening, refused to heed the women’s request that permission to show the picture be denied, saying that he could see nothing wrong with the film. “‘It is just what goes on in every day life,’ he said.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>
	When “what goes on in everyday life” is changing dramatically it inevitably raises profound challenges with regard to how everyday life will be represented in the popular media. In the early 1920s, the film industry seized on the furor over the modern girls’ demands for sexual liberty and fulfillment inside and outside of marriage to introduce not only new subject matter, but new modes of addressing its diverse audience. Social upheaval in this period coincided with the media industries’ movement toward  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> unprecedented speed of adaptation and cooperation, making possible a powerful new intermediality. The film industry used this to generate layered meanings beyond the confines of the film text, encouraging bold viewers to see through the camouflage with which it sought to appease more traditionalist audience members. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>, through a smokescreen of melodramatic conventions and moral lessons, it delivered a strikingly modern conception of sexuality and marriage to the big screen.

	    Lea Jacobs explains how this same basic narrative strategy, referred to as the rule of compensating moral values, came to be one of the standard methods of film industry self-regulators for dealing with the controversial fallen woman film from 1928 to 1934. <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> appeared at a time when the film industry was gradually formulating industry-wide strategies for dealing with controversial subject matter in films and the problems that it created for business. The MPPDA was created in 1922 to facilitate self-regulation of the industry, thus improving its reputation and avoiding costly external censorship. Its initial regulatory efforts under “The Formula” from 1924 applied only to notorious literary works acquired for adaptation by the studios. <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> was thus released just before the MPPDA began reviewing books and plays intended for film adaptation, rewriting and retitling those deemed offensive. Submission of scripts before they went into production began in 1928 and was “a routine part of pre-production” by 1931.

  These are all rather fanciful stories centering on unruly ingénues who take unconventional paths towards ultimately suitable marriages. For example, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Off-shore Pirate</span> features a flapper who rebels against the wishes of her father, only to fall in love with his hand-picked suitor when the young man poses as a pirate and kidnaps her to win her affection. “Myra Meets His Family,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span> (20 March 1920), was released by Fox as <span style="font-style:italic;">Husband Hunter</span> on 19 September 1920, “Head and Shoulders,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span> (21 February 1920), was released by Metro as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Chorus Girl’s Romance</span> on 17 August 1920, and “The Off-shore Pirate,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span> (29 May 1920), was released by Metro under the same name on 7 February 1921. Quickly adapted plays featuring the courtship and marital shenanigans of modern girls included Eugene Walter’s “The Flapper: An American Drama in Three Acts” (c. 15 April 1922), which Pyramid Pictures released as <span style="font-style:italic;">What Fools Men Are</span> on 29 October 1922, Martha M.

An article from 1924 also discussed the trend toward rapid adaptation, and pointed out its repercussions on the established selling patterns of the publishing industry. “Producers are anxious to get their films to the front while the book interest is keenest, with consequent publicity value,” it reports. “This brings it about that fiction now often appears on the screen within six or eight months of its first appearance in book form.” It goes on to state that formerly, when books reached the screen within a year or two, publishers kept to a formula of reprinting a year or two afterward. “With the speeding up of this program, the author and publisher focus their interest upon getting out a reprint within eight months or so of the publishing of the original. This has happened to three or four books in January.” “The Movie and the Book Again,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Publisher’s Weekly</span> (16 February 1924), 509.

    Discussing Swanson’s casting as a flapper in <span style="font-style:italic;">Prodigal Daughters</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> reviewer said, “The picture presents an unfortunate mishandling of Gloria Swanson which injures it in many ways. The fan public has been long accustomed to see Miss Swanson in a certain type of heroine, a woman  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of sophistication and the wearer of the last word in modes. This time they have made her a giddy flapper, and the result is a disappointment. . . . Miss Swanson doesn’t look herself, and from the way she plays she must have felt out of her element.” “Prodigal Daughters,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety Film Reviews</span> (10 April 1923).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f30" href="#f30-text">30. </a><span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Post</span> (3 December 1923), in <span style="font-style:italic;">Colleen Moore Scrapbook #2</span> (Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Los Angeles, CA). In the spring of 1924, the <span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> said, “If Colleen Moore didn’t invent the flapper she has crystallized that effervescent young person and set her on the screen for all to see and copy—and a whole lot of girls have done just that thing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle,</span> Sunday, 29 June 1924, in <span style="font-style:italic;">S#3</span>). F. Scott Fitzgerald later contributed to the belief that Moore originated the flapper on the screen, calling her, for example, “the torch” that lit up flaming youth. Moore herself also endorsed this view of the screen flapper’s origins. In her autobiography, she states, “With <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span> a new word entered the American vocabulary—flapper. She was the new American girl, Colleen Moore her prototype.” Colleen Moore, <span style="font-style:italic;">Silent Star</span> (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1968), 141, 135. More recently, Richard Koszarski has said, “Colleen Moore was the first to establish the screen archetype of the flapper, as early as 1923 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Flaming Youth</span>.” Koszarski, <span style="font-style:italic;">An Evening’s Entertainment</span>, 307.

    On 15 December 1923, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Screen Mirror</span> reported that, “As the incendiary flapper of ‘Flaming Youth,’ Colleen Moore is conceded by critics and public alike to have scored the biggest individual hit of the present season to date. Another success of this kind, and Colleen could easily head a presidential ticket next year” (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Screen Mirror,</span> 15 December 1923, in <span style="font-style:italic;">S#3</span>). Based on questionnaires filled out by 1600 exhibitors, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily Yearbook</span> reported that by the fall of 1924, Moore was tied for eighth as a box office attraction (“The Box Office Test,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Yearbook, 1925</span>, 5). In January 1925, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> said that “picture men concede that Colleen Moore is First National’s best money bet now that Norma Talmadge has announced she will in the future release through United Artists” (“So Big,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety Reviews,</span> 7 January 1925). By 1926, Moore led the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitors Herald</span> poll of female box office performers. She topped the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitors Herald</span> poll again in 1927, and was only knocked down to second place in 1928 by Clara Bow, another flapper star (<span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitors Herald-World Almanac,</span> 1927<span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitors Herald-World Almanac,</span> 1928, and 1929).

    The conversation on page 305 follows up on a section in the previous pages in which Pat asks Osterhaut if Monty will know that she isn’t a virgin when they are married and expresses her disgust that Monty was caught frequenting a road house in the past. The full text of 305 is as follows: “‘. . . isn’t the same. I may have been a silly little fool, but—oh, Bobs! Can’t you understand?’ ‘Who was the man, Bambina?’ At the old term of affection her face softened. ‘Can’t you guess, Bobs, dear?’ she whispered. A blinding, burning illumination lighted up his memory of a hundred small, vitally significant facts, against which the sudden certainty stood forth, black and stark. ‘Cary Scott, by God!’ Pat’s face was set. Her eyes, somber but fearless, answered him. ‘The damned scoundrel!’ ‘He <span style="font-style:italic;">isn’t</span>.’ ‘Isn’t? A man of his age to come into a house as a friend and seduce an innocent child!’ ‘He didn’t seduce me any more than I seduced him.’ ‘Don’t talk infernal nonsense.’ ‘It’s true; it’s <span style="font-style:italic;">true</span>, and you’ve got to believe it. It was as much my fault as his.’ ‘Was it your fault that he left you, like a coward?’ ‘He didn’t. I sent him away. He wanted to get free and marry me, and he would have done it if I’d let him. He was terribly in love with me, Bobs. Monty doesn’t love me that way. Nobody ever will again.’ ‘Well, why wouldn’t you marry him?’ queried the amazed physician. ‘Oh, I don’t know.’ She gave her shoulders the childish petulant wiggle of old, again the <span style="font-style:italic;">petite gamine</span> of Scott’s patient love. ‘He’s so old.’ ‘Then why in the name — ’ ‘You’re full of whys, Bobs. It happened; that’s all. Nobody ever knows why or how in these things, do they? I—I just lost my footing and drew him with me, if you want the truth of it’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FY</span>, 305).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  “A Soldier of Humour,” the opening story of Wyndham Lewis’s 1927 collection of short stories entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span>, is a neglected but important document in the history of modernism. Initially completed on the front line at the Battle of Messines Ridge, provocatively published in 1917–18 in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span>, and then extensively reworked during the 1920s, the story is central to Lewis’s thinking throughout the middle period of his career. Although <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> is usually seen as a document of early modernism, marked by a savagely satiric anti-humanism, we can instead read “A Soldier of Humour” as an expression of the social and cultural anxiety in England which results from the political and economic rise of America during the 1920s. Taken together with Lewis’s theoretical statements in “The Meaning of the Wild Body,’” this story points towards a distinctively late modern poetics in Lewis’s work.

<h1 class="sec-headA">“A Soldier of Humour”</h1>
<p>
	Looking back to the 1920s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting and Bombardiering</span> , Wyndham Lewis defined a period of self-imposed exile in his career. After publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Tarr</span> in 1918 “I buried myself,” Lewis wrote. “I disinterred myself in 1926, the year of the General Strike.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> But this is no simple bibliographic exercise. Rebirth is cast in mythological terms; Lewis is “disinterred,” not simply dug up, and steps out of his grave like a mummified king, brought back to the light from an intellectual cocoon. These have not been barren years: he left the world one diagnosis and he returns with a new one. A good deal of academic criticism has subsequently used Lewis’s demarcation of the General Strike as a waypoint for navigating his career and modernism more broadly.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> But little attention has been paid to Lewis’s immediate artistic concern as he rises from his rhetorical tomb. For it is not <span style="font-style:italic;">The Childermass</span>  or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Apes of God</span>  that initially focuses Lewis’s attention, but rather the short stories with which he commenced his career in 1907 and which were collected in 1927 as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> These stories represent a direct link from the early Lewis to the mature Lewis.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> And we can perhaps be more even specific, for it is “A Soldier of Humour,” initially published with <span style="font-style:italic;">Tarr</span> in 1917–18 and extensively reworked during the 1920s, which leads and subtitles the collection when Lewis is reborn. This is neither a piece of juvenilia nor an early modernist travel story. Rather it is a crucial document in the evolution of twentieth-century literature, distinctively and uniquely engaging with the rise of American politics and culture in the 1920s.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	“A Soldier of Humour” is, loosely, the story of Lewis’s trip to Europe in 1907 and 1908, told through the use of a first-person narrator called Ker-Orr. Bracketed at the start and the end by bohemian Paris, Ker-Orr travels first to primitive Bayonne and then to the Basque region. Bayonne, an important commercial center of seaborne trade, populated by both Basques and Gascons and sited at the margins of two European countries, provides Lewis with the perfect theater for the story’s confrontation of nationality, race, and origin. In the final 1927 version of the story, Lewis makes Bayonne into a glaringly modern city, distinctly postwar in tone and governed by an economy based on consumption rather than on agriculture. The symbol of this new economy is the hotel, likened to “the blazonry of cheap ice-cream wells, under a striped umbrella,” which acts to entice and menace Ker-Orr like an iridescent Marxist commodity. “Each frail structure shines and sparkles with a hard, livid and disreputable electricity, every floor illuminated,” Ker-Orr records and thereby establishes a series of uneasy oppositions that persist throughout the narrative. What Ker-Orr encounters in Bayonne is a denatured reality where desire consumes the individual. The hotels constitute a “competitive universe,” cut off from a natural world that in contrast is magically “spangled with the vivid spanish stars” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20). This is not the simple primitive Breton backwater, the landscape of peasants, puppets, and primitives typically depicted by academic criticism on these stories.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is also radically different to the Bayonne of Lewis’s contemporaries. Compare it for example to Hemingway’s pastoral Bayonne in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiesta</span>, published a year earlier in 1926. For Hemingway’s narrator, Jake, Bayonne is simply “a nice town . . . . very clean . . . on a big river.” Whereas Ker-Orr sees a “row of rather obscene little hotels, crudely painted,” Jake sees “pigeons out in the square” and “yellow, sunbaked” houses and hotels (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20).<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Hemingway has chosen to detail the picturesque elements of the city as a tourist; Lewis has transformed his initial encounter of 1907 unrecognizably and firmly accentuated its carnivalesque aspects.
      </p>
<p>
	Ker-Orr’s sense of artifice operating behind the scenery of the city is replicated at the level of form. It is not quite clear how we should react to this self-confessed “large blond clown, ever so vaguely reminiscent (in person) of William Blake” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 17). Lewis’s satire, instead of savagely disarming its objective content, is blunt, forced to double back and deliberately challenge its own pretensions to mean: “‘Fonda del Universo,’ ‘Fonda del Mundo’: Universal Inn and World Inn, two of these places were called, I noticed. I was tired and not particular as to which universe I entered. They all looked the same.” As Ker-Orr moves into this internal and unstable world, the pervading sense of duplicity, mystery, and fear continues. Everything inside is too glaringly visible through the “glass roof” and “glass door” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20–21). Special attention is given to one such door of “shining cut-glass” which seems to hold a clue to Ker-Orr’s fate and explain his paranoia: “[It] seemed the direction I ought to take when I should have made up my mind to advance.” The “unsubstantial pretentiously new appearance” of this Bayonne hotel soon starts to uncannily resemble a prototype of Frederic Jameson’s own “‘<span style="font-style:italic;">Fonda del Universo</span>,’” the Bonaventura Hotel, a “total space, a complete world, a kind of miniature city.” Both share a structure composed of mirrors and glass, an essential redefinition of internal space, and a confusion of entrance and exit, of internal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and external pathway.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Both act as spaces of heightened alienation, a concentrated version of the outside world:

	  It is in the hotel dining room, “compact with hard light,” that space becomes most supremely condensed. Nothing escapes the light’s persuasiveness, its ability to uncover honesty and newness. The electricity dissolves the object: “My eyes fixed on a piece of cheese which the high voltage of the electricity revealed in all its instability” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 22). The scene dissolves into anthropomorphic grotesqueness:

	    The primitivism of the early versions of the wild body stories has evaporated here, replaced instead with an inverted satire that struggles to control the horror implicit in both its content and form.
	  </p>
<p>
	    As Ker-Orr becomes increasingly destabilized he meets Valmore, the uncanny, “sublime,” and predestined source of his paranoia. Valmore is the very corporeal expression of the hotel, secreted into being by its bricks and mortar: “He issued from a void. . . . He was part of the mystery of this hotel; his loneliness, his aplomb, his hardy appetite.” The source of his mystery is an ambiguous national and racial origin, the detail of which is only revealed to us progressively. Initially, Valmore appears to be French born, dressed like a peasant in a straw hat and extravagant suit, from the “grimy commercial Midi,” blank and impersonal (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 21–23). But this is soon replaced by a realization that Valmore is in some way Americanized. It is not until toward the end of the story that it becomes clear that he is a Frenchman by birth and he has subsequently gained some form of actual or cultural citizenship in America. Ker-Orr explains, “‘he hails from the southern part of France, and americanism came to him as a revelation when youth had already passed.’” “‘He won’t leave Englishmen alone. He persecutes them, apparently, wherever he finds them,’” he adds (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 41). This cultural opposition forms the basis of the stories’ subsequent series of <span style="font-style:italic;">agons</span>.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What is crucial in Ker-Orr’s apprehension of this Americanization is his categorization of Valmore’s “illusion of superiority.” He sees Valmore embodying the characteristics of a new empowered class. Valmore carries “the air of being the real thing” and a “careless impudence.” He is “insolently heedless,” full of “colossal disdain,” and rooted by an “air of security” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 25). Valmore is depicted as a modern entrepreneur: hotelier, ship owner, and early property magnate. “‘He owns the Burgalésa and many houses in Pontaisandra. Ships, too—Es Américano,’” Ker-Orr is told by the locals (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 39). His “dark purple-slate suit with thin crimson lines . . . dark redhat-band . . . rose-buff tie, swarming with cerulean fire-flies,” initially seen as the primitive attire of a strawhatted  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> peasant, becomes some kind of modern zoot suit, the “soft national armour” of the “yankee” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 23 and 30). The same chain of concepts is used when Ker-Orr meets three “authentic” American friends, ironically multinational, called Morton, Blauenfeld, and Taffany:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Optimism, consciousness of power (no wonder! I reflected) surged out of them, my simple-hearted friends. Ah, the kindness! the <span style="font-style:italic;">overwhelming</span> kindness. I bathed voluptuously in this american greeting—this real american greeting. Nothing naturalized about <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span>. At the same time I felt almost awe at the thought of the dangerous nationality
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 41).
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      This complex of images is distilled to metaphors of language and particularly of accent and diction, and it is on these grounds that the successive contests with Valmore are fought.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In their first encounter, conversation can only begin once Ker-Orr establishes English as their mutual language. Valmore’s initial “‘Il fait beau ce soir!’” is met with “‘not at all,’” and it is not until Valmore, in ironic pastiche of the English obsession with the weather, shifts to “‘Oh! you’re English? It’s a fine day!’” that Ker-Orr can agree and their eyes can meet, “doubtfully.” But as soon as Valmore lapses into a New York accent the relationship changes. The movement from the perception that he is talking as an Englishman to a Frenchman, to the realization that he is in fact talking to some form of American, constitutes what Ker-Orr calls a change in “our relative positions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 22). Now the eyes that watch Ker-Orr do so “coldly, judicially, fixedly”; these are “facetted eyes—the eyes of the forty-eight States of the Union” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 24). And from this point the horror story is made real, the satire exposed as fear, as Valmore becomes cyborg in his nature, “dead and inactive . . . a phantom of his former self . . . a ghost” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 35). This story of the “virgin source of a racial hatred” is staged not between the old protagonists of Britain and Europe, but with an entirely new locus of power and energy (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 20). And the overriding fear is of suppression. Ker-Orr imagines Valmore as the colonizing force, the usurper, and himself as the “Redskin,” the indigenous population soon to be dispossessed. Kerr-Orr uses “Sioux-like, Blackfeet-like manoeuvres,” revealing a metaphorical tomahawk that is pretechnological in its naivety. In contrast, behind Valmore’s humor is a capitalist gun threatening Ker-Orr with a replay of extinction, the way “the american citizen . . . had at length overcome the Sioux and Cherokee” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 27). What this strange interplay of birthplace and adopted citizenship, origin and nationality, and language and accent documents is the anxiety associated with the process of cultural, political, and social hegemony we have come to term Americanization.

<p>
	      The humor of this particular soldier is then tinged with dark comedy. Indeed, the first complete version of the story was completed in the midst of physical battle, following Lewis’s attachment as a Second Lieutenant to 224 Siege Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1917.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Under the guidance of Ezra Pound, Lewis made a series of significant revisions to the story as he prepared to t in the Battle of the Messines Ridge, the prelude to his major encounter with war at Passchendaele. He wrote to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pound on June 8 and described, “the desolation of the Bosche concrete dugouts in a wilderness of charred spikes that was formerly a wood . . . dead Germans lying about like bloody waxworks.” In the same letter he asked Pound for the first eight pages of the draft short story left in his possession. “I should probably have time to put that right . . . P.S. Do not print Soldier of Humour until I have made that alteration,” he adds. Between June 14 and July 10, by which time he was hospitalized with trench fever, Lewis’s letters document the receipt of the manuscript from Pound and the final stages of the revisionary process.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Given the confrontation of Anglo-American manners in the story it is provocative, perhaps characteristically so, that the story was then finally published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> in two parts in December 1917 and January 1918. Not only was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> a self-consciously American publication, but following the journal’s move from Chicago to New York in January 1917 and the growing influence of the European avant-garde after Pound’s appointment as Foreign Editor in May 1917, readers had begun to actively complain at its foreignness, particularly as its focus shifted from poetry to fiction.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Lewis’s short story, with its direct confrontation of Anglo-American relations, intrudes out of war and into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> at an important moment in history.
	    </p>
<p>
	      But it is the historical backdrop to the revisions Lewis made to the final version of the story in the summer of 1927 that are most revealing. In the major historical accounts of Anglo-American diplomacy, it is the breakdown of negotiations at that summer’s Geneva naval armament conference that represents the nadir in twentieth-century bilateral relations.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although America’s economic growth and imperialism had posed a series of threats to the British Empire even prior to 1900, through a respectful recognition of each country’s territorial rights and ambitions, a sense of united heritage and language, and, perhaps most keenly, as a result of a united sense that the principal threat to both was from European imperial ambitions, and especially those of Germany, disputes had been largely resolved through compromise and conciliation. But America’s entry into the war in 1917 had altered the terrain, diplomatically and economically. Woodrow Wilson commented privately that, “when the War is over we can force them [Britain and France] to our way of thinking, because by that time they will, among other things, be financially in our hands.” In contrast, in Britain, Lord Northcliffe wrote to a friend in 1917 that “we are down on our knees to the Americans.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The economic consequences of Britain’s victory served to accelerate both the process of relative decline and advancement and the antagonism between the countries throughout the 1920s. Despite Britain’s significant war debt to the U.S., the British Empire still controlled most of the key basic resources, especially oil and rubber, necessary for industrial growth in the U.S. And Britain retained the world’s largest merchant fleet and managed the vast majority of the world’s communication cables.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The U.S. continued to push for free trade and feared exclusion from European markets, a situation exacerbated by increased naval building on both sides. Colonially, on the one hand the U.S. felt Britain had gained significant territory as a result of the First World War, albeit at huge human loss, on the other British politicians feared that Canada was becoming harder to defend geographically and moving intellectually and culturally closer to the U.S.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> But there were other non-economic and non-imperial frustrations. In the U.S.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> there was significant ill feeling directed at Britain and its Empire, particularly from displaced ethnic groups such as the American-Irish population after the suppression of the Easter Rising in 1916. Reciprocally, British society held American war neutrality, commercialism, and its supposed absence of culture with disdain. Yet there was a growing feeling in Britain that American society was dominating British culture. American rags and jazz numbers, previously frowned upon, became increasingly popular. Cocktails became accepted in higher society and chewing gum was advertised in newspapers for the first time; lipstick, rouge, eyebrow and eyelash colorings, white silk stockings, and beauty-parlors all became prominent in British metropolitan centers through the same American advertising.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span> commented on March 18, 1927 that American cinema was effectively taking over British life. The British “go to see American stars” the newspaper stated, to such an extent that, for at least a segment of the British population, a form of colonization is considered complete: “They have been brought up on American publicity. They talk America, think America, and dream America. We have several million people, mostly women, who to all intent and purpose are temporary American citizens.” Echoing the article, Elsie, the housemaid in Winifred Holtby’s <span style="font-style:italic;">South Riding</span>, published two years earlier in 1925, is described as being “like most of her generation and locality,” a trilingual speaker: “She talked B.B.C. English to her employer, Cinema American to her companions, and Yorkshire dialect to old milkmen.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> When many British industries were forced into systems of elaborate import tariffs to protect domestic trade from American exports, the motivation was sociopolitical and not just economic.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The Geneva Naval Conference of 1927 represented the culmination of this antagonism. Called by President Coolidge on February 10, 1927, as Lewis completed the first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span>, the conference and the prepublication revisions of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> effectively ran in tandem. The conference opened on June 20 and relations quickly deteriorated due to the intractability of the negotiating position taken by each side.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> While the U.S. insisted on expanding earlier naval agreements to include a broader class of vessels, Britain remained wedded to the underlying philosophy, if not the actual units of measurement, of the 1898 British Naval Defence Act, specifically that British naval strength should be calculated by reference to the size of her closest potential aggressor.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The resultant impasse triggered the start of a naval arms race, leading in February 1929 to the U.S. securing approval for the Cruiser Construction Bill.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Winston Churchill, fearing war, wrote to Cabinet on July 20, “however foolish and disastrous such a war would be, it is, in fact, the only basis upon which the discussions at Geneva are preceding. We do not wish to put ourselves in the power of the United States.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Austen Chamberlain, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, “thought it not only conceivable but probable that hostilities would break out.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      By the time Lewis wrote the “Foreword” to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> on July 6 and arranged for the final delivery of the manuscript to Chatto &amp; Windus, this private confrontation had become very public. Both sides expressly used the press to represent their own positions, each appealing to the other’s public opinion particularly by focusing on issues of affordability.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> For many years the newspaper industries had capitalized on Anglo-American frustrations to drive circulation growth. Robert Vansittart, Head  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the American Department of Foreign Office from 1924–28, records having been told by the “sub-editor of one of the cheaper [British news]papers [that] he could at any time double his circulation by open hostility to America.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In Britain, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span> covered the event extensively on a daily basis with a special correspondent in Geneva. In the U.S., the editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> was reported to have reminded his own Geneva correspondent, Wythe Williams, that he was reporting a “disarmament conference and not a battlefield.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> This very public standoff remained in the British imagination for many years. In Evelyn Waugh’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Decline and Fall</span>, published in 1928, when Paul Pennyfeather is asked against which country Britain will t the next war, he responds “stoutly” with the reply, “‘the Americans.’”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> America had firmly replaced Germany in British imaginations by 1927.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Lewis arrived in the U.S. toward the end of July, in time to experience the American response to the failure of the conference on August 4. Lewis wrote to Charles Prentice on August 1, from the Hotel Brevoort on Fifth Avenue, with mixed feelings about what he saw in New York: “You can here observe the ‘neo-barbarism’ in full flower. The high buildings are very impressive, especially the later ones, ‘hanging-gardens style.’”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> One of the few works of visual art produced by Lewis in the 1920s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhattan</span> (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>), can be dated to this period. As in the letter to Prentice, Lewis mixes architectural awe with a sense of fear that the rhythmic patterns of history, of cycles of violence, lay buried beneath America’s crowded streets: at the centre of the canvas lies a totemic re sacrificed at the hands of an ominous crowd holding aloft a bloodied triangular instrument.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Upon his return to London, Lewis emphasized the simultaneity of the threat and opportunity of America in “Paleface or ‘Love? What ho! Smelling Strangeness,’” initially published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span> in September 1927. “By key-nation I mean that what the United States are today, the other most ‘advanced’ countries we know, from experience, will become tomorrow. Karl Marx, in his day, told people to watch Industrial England, on the same principle,” he wrote as he envisioned the Old World’s eclipse. By the time Lewis expanded this essay into book form in 1929, the U.S. had become for him a new Roman Empire, the place where “the new Law and the new Norm” are defined by the “<span style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span>.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> America would dominate his thoughts from this point forward in “The Americanisation of Art” , <span style="font-style:italic;">Men Without Art</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">America, I Presume</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">America and Cosmic Man</span> .
	    </p>
<p>
	      Lewis’s confrontation of Anglo-American relations in “A Soldier of Humour” can then be mapped on to a broader global political, social, and cultural crisis. But what exactly was this crisis? As many diplomatic documents from the period suggest, war with the U.S. had always been seen as an impossible outcome for Britain. As early as 1909 the Colonial Office Defence Committee had determined that “in view of the remoteness of a war with the United States, and of the extreme difficulty of providing local defences adequate to deal with the formidable scale of attacks they could bring to bear, it has been decided . . . attack by the United States need not be taken into consideration in determining the standard of defences of parts of the Western Atlantic.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The much broader issue was that Britain’s leading role in the world had been usurped. A British government report of November 1928, following on closely from the Kellogg-Briand  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pact of August 1928, entitled “Anglo-American Relations,” made the situation clear. Britain could no longer afford to t the U.S. in so public a fashion:
	    </p>

<p class="continued">
	      That “impotent confession” had largely been made at Geneva. Economically, it had been true since the U.S. entered the war in 1917. Increasingly during the 1920s, as the British public bought American exports, it also became true at a social level. And aesthetically too, it is perhaps possible to remap Paul Peppis’s influential prewar opposition of British and European imperialism on to postwar Anglo-American relations.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Whereas Lewis’s enemies as he returns from internment in 1926 have been taken to be the English coterie of Bloomsbury and the Sitwells, this genealogy suggests the source of Lewis’s anxiety lies in America.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Indeed, since Lewis’s self-imposed burial, American modernism had started to find its own voice, shedding the influence of European expatriates linked to the New York dada movement. Lewis was acutely aware of America’s attempts to Americanize its art, to get rid of the “tell-tale ecstatically wriggling back-side, [which] remains in the Café du Dôme, Montparnasse” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PF</span>, 116). William Carlos Williams had launched the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Contact</span> in 1920 specifically to develop a native American modernism. Sinclair Lewis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Babbitt</span> , John Dos Passos’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhattan</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Transfer</span> , and Hemingway’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Torrents of Spring</span>  had all been published in the preceding years. The distinct American modernism that Lewis had anticipated since the war edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span>, “when it comes,” as “Mongol, inhuman, optimistic, and very much on the precious side, as opposed to European pathos and solidity,” had arrived.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> So by the time Lewis finally revised “A Soldier of Humour” he faced the possibility that a new cultural center was set to relegate, yet again, his own work to the margins, as an indigenous American modernism increasingly challenged an expatriate Eurocentric modernism located in Berlin, London, and Paris, replicating at an artistic level what was true politically and economically.
	    </p>
<p>
	      What then does this mean for our understanding of Lewis? It has traditionally been the case that the Left has seen Lewis as the quintessential embodiment of a certain type of modernist politics. While this has been theorized by Jameson and popularized by John Carey, we can trace it back to W. H. Auden’s contemporary depiction of Lewis as “That lonely old volcano of the Right” and Orwell’s categorization of Lewis’s and high modernism’s pervasive “<span style="font-style:italic;">pessimism of outlook</span>.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> This continues to persist in recent academic work.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> The central problem with this discourse is that it effectively places Lewis’s entire oeuvre, almost irrespective of historical specificity, in an early modernist literary tradition. Associating Lewis with this tradition may certainly have some validity when we think about him as a prewar Vorticist, but by the 1920s Lewis had swapped <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> first for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tyro</span> and then for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Enemy</span>, and his own attentions had simultaneously moved away from local imperial rivalries toward a future with America at its center. Indeed, Duchamp had already turned the avant-garde in the same direction, announcing to a journalist in September 1915, three months after his arrival in New York, that he believed “the art of Europe is finished—dead—and that America is the country of the art of the future.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Duchamp’s statement, as he escapes the horror of European war, is the first sign that early modernism, dominated and energized by a Europhilic American expatriate community, was shifting its focus back across the Atlantic. By the late 1920s Lewis had followed in the same direction: Gertrude Stein had replaced F. T. Marinetti as his artistic target; Hemingway’s accented English, the “volapük which probably will be ours tomorrow,” had become the major linguistic threat to the Romance languages of Europe.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Eurocentric, Anglo-American modernism had for Lewis largely lost its ability to engage with the modern world: Ezra Pound had become merely “A Man in Love with the Past.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Siamese Demon</h1>
<p>
	      There is however a twist at the end of Lewis’s story. Having left Bayonne, Ker-Orr continues his journey into Spain, traveling by train through Castille to Galicia. In Pontaisandra, an imaginary town on the Atlantic seaboard, Ker-Orr finds himself inadvertently staying in Valmore’s own hotel, the Burgalésa. He checks out the following morning in fear, and the battle recommences with his “wonderful american enemy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 35). In the story’s final scene, Ker-Orr hires the three authentic Americans to demonstrate to Valmore the nature of his American pretensions. As these four metaphorical soldiers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prepare for battle, as if entrenched ahead of the call for engagement, Morton produces a pack of photographs:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		He insisted on producing a packet of obscene photographs, which he held before him fan-wise, like a hand of cards, some of them upside down. The confused mass of bare legs and arms of the photographs, distorted by this method of holding them, with some highly indecent details occurring here and there, produced the effect of a siamese demon
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 42).
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		This strange image belongs to Lewis’s 1927 vision and not that of 1917. Whilst the photographs are present in the original version of the story, they exist in a less surreal form:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Morton possessed a little seraglio of photographs of ladies that his undecided and catholic fancy had made him indulge in . . . . He had his favourite photograph, of course. It was the least tactful, merely, I am afraid
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 346).
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Here Ker-Orr is judging Morton: the “of course” and the “I am afraid” are close to authorial apology. And the photographs are just one item of several in Morton’s possession, alongside a knife, a revolver, some money, an astrological book, a card-case, a dictionary, and a map. But by 1927 the one object, the fan of photographs, stands in for this whole inventory. The photographs are made to stand as the cultural representation of a particular viewpoint upon the products of American soft power, rendered in the bits and pieces of pornographic culture.
		</p>
<p>
		  Although I can find no visual equivalent in modernism for Lewis’s literary image, we might turn to Jay DeFeo’s photocollage, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blossom</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), to find the closest visual approximation. Completed between 1956 and 1958 as American Beat artists started to introspectively reflect on American power, DeFeo’s image graphically depicts the process by which the body is constructed from pieces rather than being something unified.
		</p>
<p>
		  DeFeo’s female body is constructed as it enters the symbolic order, represented in this case by the imagery of the advertising and pornography industries. In so doing the painting visualizes the process of Lacanian identity creation, namely the hallucinatory process through which the infant, despite initially experiencing the body in a fragmentary state as separate parts or pieces (arms, legs, fingers, and toes), learns to think that the body is both whole and continuous with the self. Lacan calls this originary and fragmentary state the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps morcelé</span>.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> But whereas DeFeo uses this discovery to redefine female identity, as an expanding vortex of energy that builds upon itself, Lewis uses it to show how the Lacanian <span style="font-style:italic;">moi</span> is threatened with break-up when such incompleteness is first discovered. For Lewis’s army, the photographs exert a totemic hold: unlike DeFeo they look rather than create. Blauenfeld grins inanely at them: “‘I know that coon,’ he insisted, pointing to one of the photos. ‘I swear I know that coon.’” Morton kisses one of them and as they threaten to intoxicate his army, Ker-Orr must confiscate them to allow his plan to come off. But they refuse to be silenced, and Ker-Orr too is hypnotized into spreading them out in the same fantastical fashion. Having  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sent his troops into battle, he finds himself suddenly struck by the role-playing nature of his game. As he tries to avoid thinking of the machinery he has set in process, we are reminded that this is indeed a mock, not a real, battle and that all the players are merely actors: “But the stage analogy affected me, in the sense that I became rather conscious of my appearance. I must await my cue, but was sure of my reception. I was the great star that was not expected. I was the unknown quantity” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 42–43). The cards trigger the realization of the performative nature of all identity: its constructedness, the way it too has been inscribed with race, gender, and nationality, and how it merely represents the playing of parts.

		  This very contemporary and un-modernist theory is lent support by Lewis’s essay, “The Meaning of the Wild Body,” one of the theoretical essays expanded in 1927 to help explain the concerns of the collected short stories. Although a great deal of criticism has been focused on the second part of this essay, “The Root of the Comic,” with its famous inversion of Henri Bergson’s theory of the comic as “the sensations resulting from the observations of a <span style="font-style:italic;">thing</span> behaving like a person,” significantly less attention has been given to the first part of the essay, subtitled “The Meaning of the Wild Body” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158–160). Lewis starts this part of the essay by arguing that his theory of satire assumes the validity of the Cartesian premise of the separation of mind and body. We laugh, he argues, when we observe the body’s absurdity: its lumpen inappropriateness, its sheer animality. This statement has often been used as a starting point for understanding Lewis’s anti-humanitarianism, with Cartesian dualism remapped as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the opposition of the laughing observer to the wild body, as reason to impulse, and as oligarchy to democracy.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> But if we examine this essay more closely we see that this is only incidental to Lewis’s thesis. He argues that absurdity is “the chasm lying between being and non-being, over which it is impossible for logic to throw any bridge, that, in certain forms of laughter, we leap.” When we approach the absurd “we land plumb in the centre of Nothing.” He goes on to suggest that the best way of experiencing or approaching this absurdity is through the experience of alterity, and particularly in the observation of nationality. Since everyday reality is engrained with preconception and assumption, it is only in the observation of difference that absurdity can be clearly revealed to us: “It is easy for us to see, if we are french, that the German is ‘absurd,’ or if german, that the French is ‘ludicrous,’ for we are <span style="font-style:italic;">outside</span> in that case” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 157–58). Observing national habits such as these—or the religious practices of the Jew or the class-based habits of the Oxbridge educated—serves as a mechanism for crystalizing the ontological chasm into materiality, which is rather similar to the point of textual contradiction in deconstruction theory. When familiarity has been removed we can begin to see the absurdity, or rather the extent to which being and behavior are functions of both culture and nature.
		</p>
<p>
		  Looked at from this perspective, Lewis appears dangerously close to articulating a theory of individual practice that relies, at least politically, on behaviorism’s arsenal of habits and learned gestures. Of course, Lewis’s antagonistic stance to behaviorism is apparent in his own work and has been well documented in academic studies.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> In order to resolve this inconsistency, criticism has tended to assume that Lewis was simply bifurcating the world into those masses for whom the laws of behaviorism were all too painfully true and those few decision-makers capable of an intellectual life.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Instead, I believe it is suggestive to consider Lewis’s essay in the terms laid out by Marcel Mauss in a 1934 lecture at a meeting of the Société de Psychologie. Mauss’s interest lay, as with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span> article of 1927, in understanding how cinema was translating American manners on to European bodies: “American walking fashions had begun to arrive over here [Paris], thanks to the cinema.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> This formed the basis for his theory on “techniques of the body,” the idea that every physical action carries the imprint of learning. For Mauss this acts philosophically as a means of escaping the circularity of Cartesianism or, in Lewis’s terms, as an attempt to re-establish logic in the gap between being and non-being. In the 1920s and early 1930s then both Lewis and Mauss found that the idea of a complete homogenous body, owned and controled by the subject, was under attack by historical process.
		</p>
<p>
		  Instead of advancing an early modernist attack on democracy, Lewis’s essay attempts to advance an alternative theory of behavior at a time of enormous sociohistorical change. He turns this theory inward rather than use it as a weapon to attack his enemies:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Again, it is comparatively easy to see that another man, as an animal, is absurd; but it is far more difficult to observe oneself in that hard and exquisite light. But no man has ever continued to live who has observed himself in that manner for longer than a flash. Such  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> consciousness must be of the nature of a thunderbolt. Laughter is only summer lightning. But it occasionally takes on the dangerous form of absolute revelation
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158).
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    In part this observation probably stems from the stern self-examination that Lewis had placed himself under during the internment of the 1920s. It is certainly keenly evident in the self-reflexive properties of a painting such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr Wyndham Lewis as a Tyro</span> (1920–21), where it is not so much that the sneer is a function of intellectual arrogance, but rather that the sitter is so self-consciously unpicked by his own posture and attitude, a situation made metaphoric in color by the sheer inappropriateness of the glaring yellow background. And as the 1920s progressed, while Lewis wrote extensively about the public world, his attentions had turned significantly inward to the theorization of the self, and the “not-self,” helped by his readings in non-Western traditions.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Lewis’s point is that to observe the self as absurd is to reveal two distinct truths. First, it reveals an inherent split in the nature of subjectivity: the absurdity of the German is ultimately also the absurdity of self. And second, it reveals the irreconcilable necessity of postulating a point of objectivity from which it can be observed that being is neither wholly objective nor wholly subjective: “We are not constructed to be <span style="font-style:italic;">absolute observers</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158). The thesis must collapse under its own demands. And at this point, as the futility of the project of reason is revealed, laughter becomes so dark that it threatens life itself, forcing the ego’s involvement with a fundamental process of break-up.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Lewis is forced therefore to protect his ego from the very revelation his story documents, and he has Valmore discover his own inauthenticity through a sadomasochistic homosexual performance. As the story closes, Valmore is enticed into a state of sexual excitement by his meeting with the three authentic Americans, “his old pop-eyes beginning to stick out of his old head, and his old mouth watering.” Morton is seen “on all fours . . . tickling his legs.” And by the time Ker-Orr finally arrives, having freed himself from the siamese demon, Valmore is in metaphoric chains, sexually cuffed as he turns “a pair of solemn, appealing, outraged dog’s-eyes” upon his eroticized master Taffany. Ker-Orr finally reveals the nature of his plan, and incensed by it, Valmore turns his eyes to Morton as if asking, “Would not his master repulse and chastise this insolence?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 44). In effect, Lewis transforms Valmore’s Americanization into a symbol of the European decay he so despised, and equates it with homosexuality. Such “male-inversion” stood for Lewis as the most obvious symptom of social collapse, and it linked in his mind to images of bodily strength, by the absence or presence of vitality or substance, what he calls “starch” in the body. Homosexuality for Lewis was a form of corporeal relapse, males becoming “what in Sodom are technically called ‘bitches’, in a process of almost physiological transformation” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PF</span>, 156). Accordingly, Ker-Orr’s victory is conceived as the imposition of such a transformation on his enemy Valmore, returning him to the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps morcelé</span>:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      My enemy pulled himself together as though the different parts of his body all wanted to leap away in different directions, and he found it all he could do to prevent such disintegration. An attempt at a bow appeared as a chaotic movement, the various parts of his body could not come together for it. . . . An extraordinary confusion beset his body
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 45).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			But this cannot disguise Lewis’s awareness of the pyrrhic nature of his victory. In revealing to Valmore that he is only a Frenchman from the Midi, it also reveals to Ker-Orr, and Lewis, the fabricated nature of identity. Lewis is in effect dismantled by his own work. What Ker-Orr encounters in his first meeting with Valmore in the hall of glass that makes up the “‘<span style="font-style:italic;">Fonda del Mundo</span>’” is ultimately a reflection of the self. Valmore’s mock-Americanisms are at once both wish-fulfillment for a new modernity and a revelation of the interplay between the objective and subjective elements involved in identity creation. The battles with Valmore, based around an investigation of alterity and a revelation of the tectonic changes in international economic relations, serve to reveal that the image of a whole body is merely armor. Britain’s role as the supreme center of politics, economics, and culture was ending in the late 1920s. A new American form of civilization, of which the supreme expression would be the era we now term postmodernism, would replace it.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> This process of dismantling, as Lewis described in “The Meaning of the Wild Body,” is like a “thunderbolt”: it is the horrifying discovery of the Lacanian Real, the fragmentary body that precedes the ruse of identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">WB</span>, 158). Rather than an early modernist aesthetics, it is nothing short of a postcolonial poetics, expressed as Britain became both a postimperial and late capitalist society. Indeed, this body, strangely in common with the idea of the colonial body encountered in much postcolonial literature, is fragmented, disordered, and displaced.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The fear of this rank and file soldier of humor, in an ironic reversal of terms, is then the fear of literal and metaphorical subalternity.

			  As Jameson discusses at length in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cultural Turn</span>, postmodernism, by definition, is essentially an American historical and cultural phenomenon. However, those works that have chosen to look for a British alternative to postmodernism have tended to theorize in terms of Britain’s social, economic, and political decline, rather than the rise of the U.S. See Hugh Kenner, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Sinking Island: The Modern English Writers</span> (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1987) and Joshua Esty, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Shrinking Island: Modernism and National Culture in England</span> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004).

<p>"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country. We don't have that in our country. I don't know who has told you that we have it." So, to the amusement and jeers of his audience during an appearance at Columbia University in September 2007, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad responded to a question about the report of executions in Iran of suspected homosexuals—<span style="font-style:italic;">hamajensbaaz</span> is the derogatory term the President used.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Literary modernism—neither European, British, nor U.S. modernism, but the early twentieth-century literature of Iran—might be able to provide Ahmadinejad with an answer to his bafflement. In the well-known "Aref nameh," a linguistically innovative verse satire that appeared in 1921—one year before the publication of Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>—Iraj Mirza, an Iranian poet and advocate of the modern Iranian state, makes graphically clear whom he thinks suffers from the curse of male homosexuality, and he does so in wry verses directed against a fellow Iranian poet and boy-lover, Aref-nameh of Qazvin (hence the poem's title):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Oh Lord, what thing is this pedomania<br>        That plagues Aref and greater Tehrania?<br>Why only in this commonwealth<br>        Does sodomy take place with little stealth?<br>The European with his lofty bearing<br>        Knows not the ins and out of <span style="font-style:italic;">garçon</span>-tearing.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Reversing the dichotomy that Ahmadinejad's rhetoric sets up by declaring Tehranian "garçon-tearing" foreign to the more <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  high-minded European, Iraj proceeds to make his polemical and political point. As long as Iran holds to archaic customs like the separation of the sexes and allegiance to a decadent monarchy, Persian men will not shed their pederastic predilections and the nation will remain caught in a regressive past, unable to enter the era of modernity that Iraj, like many other advocates of Iranian modernization, associated with Europe's virtues of constitutional government and heterosexual normality.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Obviously, Ahmadinejad abhors the western values that Iraj, eighty years earlier, embraced in the name of modernity, but the two men <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> agree on one point: sexuality between men has no place in post-Qajar Iran. The rhetorical difference is that Iraj sees Iranian homosexuality as a local problem in need of eradication; Ahmadinejad labels it a Western phenomenon completely foreign to his "motherland." Such a claim, as several recent historians of Iranian sexuality, including Janet Afary and Afsaneh Njamabadi,<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> have demonstrated, is belied by the rich, centuries-long legacy of source material, written and visual, attesting to the presence of men's homoerotic loves and dalliances in pre-modern Iran (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> &amp; <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>); it is also contradicted by ongoing efforts to eliminate not-so-foreign manifestations of this "phenomenon" from Iran, as well as neighboring Gulf states, by the harshest means possible (<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 3</a> &amp; <a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>).<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Behind this tangle of conflicting claims ("we don't have it"/ "yes we do") lies one of the great ironies in the history of relations between Christian Europe and Islamic Middle East, one with political as well as poetical resonances for this essay. For the morally charged language of unnaturalness, vice, addiction, and disease used by European commentators for some 400 years to condemn same-sex practice between men in the Middle East is the identical language now used by Islamic fundamentalists who wish to differentiate their cultures from the sexually decadent West. The implication is that if sex between men occurs in the Muslim and Arab worlds, it is a foreign vice the West has exported to infect and undermine Middle Eastern culture.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The way in which male homoerotic desire has provided the symbolic and embodied terrain over which attributions of unnatural sexuality have been volleyed between Christian and Muslim cultures for centuries is part of a complex history that cannot be reduced to the binaries—"East" and "West," "heterosexuality" and "homosexuality," "self" and "other"—that popular imagination too often summons forth when using aspersions of sex between men to categorize and castigate the unknown or unfamiliar. Likewise, the derision that met Ahmadinejad's proclamation at Columbia, however merited on one level, may reveal as much about the modern West's fantasies and misprisions of Middle Eastern sexuality as it does about Ahmadinejad's myopia. Take the photograph (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>) that circulated with some frequency on the internet in the wake of the Columbia incident, picturing Ahmadinejad kissing another man. The visual punch line plays on the commonplace that those who most vehemently deny homosexuality may protest too much; simultaneously it allows viewers critical of Ahmadinejad to congratulate themselves for being more open-minded than his ilk. Yet this superiority depends on ignoring the cultural mores that make such kisses a perfectly acceptable expression of non-erotic affection in much of the Middle East. A similar mode of humor operates in the cover illustration of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> (October 2007), where the image of Ahmadinejad playing footsie in a men's bathroom stall (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>) riffs on the Senator Larry Craig scandal. However gratifying the exposure of right-wing bigots harboring the desires they condemn, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> cover also capitalizes on, and perpetuates, an unconscious degree of homophobia by equating closet-cases and foreign threats as equivalent objects of ridicule.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Such humor elides an element of truth in Ahmadinejad's defiantly obtuse statement, insofar as the historical formation of sexual bonds between men in Iran's past has differed significantly from the West's evolution of sexual</p>

<p class="continued">taxonomies and sexual identities. Ahmadinejad is no social construction theorist, to be sure, but his avowal that homosexuality <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span> "does not exist" in Iran is, at least historically and linguistically, accurate.</p>
<p>As such instances evince, "re-Orienting" one's understanding of Middle Eastern sexuality proves a task easier said than done. Indeed, the disorienting effects of such attempted reorientations are evident in the varied topographies of early twentieth-century literary and visual culture this essay traverses. Ever since the opening of the Middle East to European diplomacy and trade in the late 1500s (England, for one, chartered the Levant Company in 1589 to negotiate trade within the Ottoman Empire, having appointed its first ambassador to the country in 1583<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup>), an array of western writers, travelers, administrators, diarists, artists, and adventurers has left a vivid record of the specter of sodomy and pederasty that haunts their encounters with Levantine sexuality. Sometimes these encounters have been entirely imaginative, and sometimes based in actual experience; sometimes they have been red as voyeuristic spectacle, and sometimes they've formed the traveler's covert goal. Whether feared or desired, I argue here and elsewhere that the sheer possibility of erotic contact with or between men of the "Arabic Orient" has underwritten much of the appeal and practice of the phenomenon we call Orientalism.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> From 1600 to the present, the imaginings and meanings of this perceived topography of male homoerotic desire has multiplied across regions, countries, eras, and cultures, and it has left its traces in fiction, poetry, diaries, travel literature, erotica, ethnography, artwork both high and low, photography, and film.</p>
<p>This essay narrows that scope, offering insight into the ways in which a handful of innovative early-twentieth artists operating outside the penumbra of high modernism participated in, exploited, and responded to this larger paradigm of Orientalizing erotics. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  The works examined in the following pages encompass some twentieth-century res that many students of modernism may never have encountered, such as English aesthete-mystic Aleister Crowley and Dutch Zionist poet Jacob Israel de Haan, some whose names remain unknown, some like Andre Gide who achieved prominence, and others usually associated with Hellenist rather than Orientalist erotica, like Wilhelm von Gloeden. What all these artists share in common is the extent to which they trafficked in the myth of a homoerotic Middle East—the "nearly" Middle East of my title—where male-male desires repressed in the West might more easily find realization, along with the attendant myth of the availability of beautiful youths within such geographies. This subset of queer modernist practice reveals the convergence of three elements:  the bracing impact of the general modernist rebellion against sexual censorship inspiring these writers to engage in daring, often gleefully graphic descriptions of homosexual activity;  the contexts provided by the burgeoning fields of sexology and anthropology, whose prurient-minded imitators produced innumerable volumes about the "Arabic Orient," forming a genre that İrvin Cemil Schick aptly names "ethnopornography"<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup>; and  the degree to which these writers create self-reflexive, allusive texts that imitate, or pretend to be examples of, centuries-old Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman literary genres in order to give historical authority to their homoerotic imaginings. Additionally, in the case of Gide, we see the modernist transformation of the prior century's European tradition of travel narrative into sensuous lyric prose-poems that share significant affinities with the imitations, forgeries, and borrowings of Middle Eastern genres like the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal, şehringez</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>. Throughout, this essay also analyzes the role played by visual modes of representation, particularly turn-of-the-twentieth-century photography, in promoting this queer strand of Orientalist modernism. The conclusion circles back to the contemporary present—by means of an archive of haunting photographic portraits of Taliban recruits unearthed in Afghanistan—to suggest the continuing resonance of these modernist re-orientations as they play out on an international scale today, especially as homosexuality continues to be a touchstone of intercultural impasse, forcing Eros to reveal its other face as Thanatos.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>The imaginative work of the early twentieth-century res at the heart of this essay is not simply the product, as sometimes assumed, of a hegemonic culture's unidirectional projections onto another culture. It is equally the product of a long, complex, and often fluid history of cross-cultural exchange, one that began in earnest when diplomatic and trade relationships among Christian, Ottoman, and Persian worlds began to flourish in the Early Modern period. From roughly 1550-1850 booksellers in Europe turned out a burgeoning number of travel narratives to feed a widespread fascination with, and at times envy of, the seemingly exotic customs, and more specifically the erotic practices, of what might broadly be described as Arab-Islamic culture. To be sure, the primary sexual curiosities that fascinated these writer-observers were heterosexual—most apparent in their fantasies of the harem. But a surprisingly large number of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  commentators turned their narrative eye, at least for an instant, to the abundance of male-male desire that they espied—or thought they espied—among other forbidden forms of erotic expression. In contrast to the unseen mysteries of the female harem, these homoerotic forms of sexual expression seemed—to European sensibilities—all too visible, too public, staring the observer right in the eye.</p>
<p>Along with a predictable dose of moral outrage, these early Western travelers express amazement time and again at what seems the relative openness of homoerotic expression in the Middle East and North Africa and at its entrenchment on all levels of society, from coffeehouse culture to sultan's court, from bathhouse to janissary barracks. Michael Baudier, a French traveler to Turkey in the 1620s is shocked to find that this vice "serves as an ordinary subject of entertainment" in men's everyday conversations. Three decades later his countryman, Monsieur de Thevenot, matter-of-factly notes that sodomy "is a very ordinary Vice amongst [the Turks], which they care little to conceal," while John Lithgow claims to "have even seene at mid-day" buggerings in Fez. As for Persia, the late fifteenth-century Venetian ambassador, Josafa Barbaro, comments on the existence of a "public space and school [for] Sodomy" in Tabriz, where customers "pay according to [the students'] beauty." A few decades later Portuguese apothecary, Tomas Piras, notes that "for all their good looks most [Persians] are sodomites," adding "there are even public places where they practice this for money." The seventeenth-century French traveler, Jean Chardin concurs with numerous other Middle Eastern travelers who call public coffee houses (Chardin himself is referring to those of Persia) "nothing else in Reality but Shops for Sodomy."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>While such expressions tend to miss an insider's understanding of the complex social and gendered circumstances in which such apparently flagrant public displays occur, one cannot dismiss these observations, <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>, as simple-minded examples of Orientalizing fantasy, exaggeration, or erotic projection. This point has recently been made clear by the groundbreaking work of a number of sophisticated theorists of sexuality whose fluency in Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish has enabled them to open up immense archives of hitherto unexamined source material. As two of these, Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpakli, put it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age of Beloveds</span>, "it was easy for the West to eroticize the relations with the Ottoman East because that East had already eroticized its own social and political relationships," such that the homoerotic "was everywhere available for western scholarship and the Western imagination to discover in the East."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> On the one hand, this new scholarship is careful not to over-idealize, as did some earlier gay scholars, the sexual mores of Arab-Islamic society; Ottomans, Persians, Arabs, or Egyptians did not, contrary to the impression given in such gay-affirmative criticism, live in ultra-permissive societies that indulged in sodomy with impunity. Rather, this scholarship plots out a complex system of sexual and social mores operating throughout Arab-Islamic geographies that allowed thriving if not always welcome homoerotic subcultures to coexist with other subcultures, including legal and religious ones, in a multilayered society whose constituencies often included overlapping members and whose social structures made room for mutually operative contradictions.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> On the other hand, these scholars also make it clear that up to the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries a flourishing culture of male lovers and beloved youths permeated <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the highest levels of social and political life in the Ottoman and Persian empires, with homoerotic patronage providing an acceptable path to power for youthful beloveds. Most relevant for our purposes, this phenomenon inspired a vast literary outpouring that celebrated this culture of lovers and beloveds: in poetry, in erotic treatises, in bawdy literature, and in the biographies of the great poets and statesmen.</p>
<p>Central to this literary heritage, and at the heart of the modernist appropriations of this tradition, is its celebration of the beautiful boy or beloved youth. The specialized form of lyric known as the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span>, emerging in the Arabic Umayyad period, flowering under the 'Abbasid caliphates and in Moorish Spain, then taken up by the Persian and Ottoman poets, was dedicated to extolling the male beloved's breathtaking beauty and petulant bravado.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> was perfected by the rambunctiously bisexual medieval Persian-Arab poet, Abū Nuwās, whose ability to combine eroticism and reinvigorate conventional poetic metaphor is apparent, even in translation, in lines such as these:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>From the tangled clothing<br>Whiteness surprises:<br>Above the skyline of his waist<br>The moon suddenly rises!<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>See the moon of his face glow<br>Lit by your lust! Wave, overflow<br>And flood this lovely garden!<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The romantic tropes typifying the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> can easily transform from florid encomiums into raunchy jests. Exemplary are the following lines from the verse of an unknown Turkish sixteenth-century poet. First apostrophizing the delicacy of the "satin skin" of his "darling boy"—so delicate that even robes made of "rose-petals" chafe him!—the poet suddenly shifts to the more carnal desires motivating his flowery paean:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>So fragile is your radiant thigh<br>It even gets hurt by the morning breeze.<br>Men have fought fiercely for his legs and thighs.<br>My darling boy's lower half is enough for my eyes.<br>Let his beautiful face belong to the others.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In contrast to Abū Nuwās's metaphor, which res the glowing face of the beloved rising like a moon <span style="font-style:italic;">above</span> the "skyline of his waist," this poet jestingly trades the "beautiful face" of his beloved for the equally moon-shaped delights existing <span style="font-style:italic;">below</span> the belt, on his darling's "lower half" (round white buttocks are repeatedly red as lunar landscapes in this poetry).</p>
<p>Such racy declarations are a staple in the tradition of obscene literature and pornographic erotica that also formed a flourishing genre in the pre-modern Middle East.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The following lines from sixteenth-century Turkish poet and court administrator Gazali's mock-encomium to the joys of the beloved's anus (<span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>) anticipates the bawdy explicitness we will see in Aleister Crowley's faux-Oriental poetry: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Sometimes it opens like a smiling rose, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>Sometimes it closes and becomes a rosebud lip in wonder, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>It so appears a silver mug of medicine that<br>Fittingly I call it the cure for all, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>What if cock the dragon always pushes at its edge?<br>It is a secret treasure cave filled with gold and silver, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p>Even closer to the modernist experiments this essay canvases is the poetic pleasure of cataloguing the range and variety of available beautiful youth that drives the Ottoman genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, or so-called "city-disturber," of which there are 44 extant manuscripts. Derived from an earlier Persian genre celebrating the attractive craftsmen and shop-boys of a given locale, the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> may either survey the gamut of handsome, rambunctious youth of a specific city—giving a kind of sociological cross-section of urban types and trades in lyric form—or it may provide a catalogue of male beauties from across the globe.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The first poet to substitute the more complex <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> for that of the four-line <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> in this genre and hailed by his contemporaries as a great innovator, Sayfī, vows in his catalogue of 124 <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> dedicated to the boys of Bukhara to drink prohibited wine so that the handsome policeman with whom he's enamored will haul him off to jail<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup>; another poet, Tahcali Yahya, teases the "brilliant Janissary, with a slender re," whom he's just bedded for being hard to kiss in his <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> to the "heart-ravishers" of Istanbul<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup>; and Ottoman poet, Zati, having just sung the praises of some 53 beauties of Edirne, Turkey, claims his effort has only skimmed the surface:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I have but limned some droplets from the sea<br>Brought some sun motes to visibility.<br>Cypress bodies throng this city's earth<br>T'would take till Judgment day to tell their worth.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This technique of serial cataloguing goes global in the work of one late eighteenth-century Ottoman court poet whose <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, as the next section reveals, plays a central role in an early-twentieth-century appropriation that strategically "re-orients" this poetic genre for queerly modernist ends.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>Fāżil Bey Enderuni's <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> (1792-93; "Book of Beautiful Boys") is one of five erotic works by this colorful diplomat, administrator, and poet, four of which he composed in <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> form. Fāżil Bey's origins may have influenced his fascination with detailing the charms of lads across cultures. Like many handsome youths brought to Istanbul to be trained as pages, Fāżil was a spoil of war: his father, of Arabic descent and the governor of the Palestine cities of Acre and Safad, had participated in an unsuccessful insurgency that led to his execution by the Ottoman Porte. The head of the occupying army was so taken with the good looks of young Fāżil and his brother that the two were presented to the Sultan as tribute-slaves. Fāżil rose within the Ottoman <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  bureaucracy to assume various diplomatic and administrative posts, fell out of favor, suffered exile on Rhodes, received a pardon from Selim III, and spent his last years back in Istanbul. His one poetic composition that is not a <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defter-i aşk</span> (1795; "The Register of Love"), is an "amorous autobiography," in Jan Schmidt's phrase, detailing the four great loves of his life, all male and one of whom, the gypsy Çengi Ismail, was a renowned dancer.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> This profession also sparked Fāżil Bey's creative attention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Çengi-name</span> (undated; "The Book of Dancers"). Written as a series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> form, this book includes licentious portraits of the city's 43 most famous <span style="font-style:italic;">koceks</span>, or boy-dancers. In addition to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span>, which surveys beautiful boys around the globe, Fāżil Bey authored a companion volume, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Zenan-name</span> (also illustrated and probably composed in the 1790s), enumerating the beautiful women of the world; its lyric portraits are far less complimentary than those in his catalogue of beautiful males (typical of the male elite's general misogyny).</p>
<p>The premise for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> is set forth in a frame poem, in which the poet is asked by his lover—metaphorically the "Sultan of the climate of the desolate heart"—to reveal "which nations are filled with the most beautiful countenances of youths, / which have the most beautiful men . . . tell me A to Z!"<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Fāżil Bey rises to his lover's challenge by writing a series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> that reveal the charms not only of Moroccan boys and Greek rowdies, but of British, French, and even New World youths. The manuscript of this verse catalogue in the Istanbul University Library is interspersed with 39 exquisite miniature paintings of such "beaux" (<a name="7-text" href="#7">. 7-10</a>). Each of these visual portraits reinforces the snapshot-like quality of the verse the miniature illustrates. Tantalizingly, these illustrations also demonstrate that the West's Orientalizing gaze was not a one-way street, revealing a Middle Eastern penchant for the charms of pink-cheeked European youths (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 11 &amp; 12</a>) as well as lads closer to home.</p>

<p>How did I learn of Fāżil Bey, and how does his <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> relate to queer permutations of Orientalizing modernism? My initial source—the only one available in a European language—was a slim volume, published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> in a limited edition of 350 copies in Paris in 1909, then reproduced in 1969. While the introduction claims the text is an accurate translation of Fāżil Bey's Ottoman Turkish to French and gives a brief account of the poet's life, an endnote in the 1969 text mysteriously and contradictorily remarks that "certain people" (unnamed) have attributed the 1909 volume "to Pierre Loti, Pierre Loüys, as well as [to] André Gide . . . [T]his book . . . remains anonymous and has never been reedited."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Loti, Loüys, and Gide, of course, are late nineteenth-century or early-modernist authors known for their artistic and homoerotic investments in the Middle East or North Africa. Robert Aldrich, a historian who stumbled on this French edition, takes this statement of anonymous authorship at face value in <span style="font-style:italic;">Colonialism and Homosexuality</span> , assuming that Fāżil Bey never existed and that the volume is a hoax, a pornographic "send-up" of Orientalism that self-consciously uses the form of the "lost manuscript"—accompanied by pseudo-scholarly introduction and pompous footnotes—to poke fun at European stereotypes of male love in the Arab-Muslim East.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As the biographical record indicates, Aldrich is wrong on the latter account—Fāżil Bey <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span>, indeed, a real person, a well-known poet, bureaucrat, and court administrator whose existence is documented in the Turkish record as well as in English accounts of Ottoman poetry. The purported source of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, the Ottoman <span style="font-style:italic;">Hubanname</span>, exists in manuscript form in various rare book collections and in a transliteration into modern Turkish printed in Istanbul in 1945.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> But as a comparison of the Turkish manuscripts and the French "translation" reveals, Aldrich is correct in his surmise that the anonymous editor/translator is an early twentieth century aesthete playing loose and easy with the original. True, this French "translator" occasionally borrows random lines verbatim—thereby revealing a precise knowledge of the original—but he typically bends these borrowings to fit his own poetic conceits, inserting extended riffs and elements of plotting entirely absent in the Ottoman text. The overall result is a series of prose-poems that are far and away the product of his own creative imagination, adding a degree of verisimilitude and erotic immediacy lacking in Fāżil Bey's allusive, generalizing style. While there is absolutely no evidence to support the 1969 edition's suggestion that notables such as Loti, Loüys, or Gide might have been the volume's anonymous author, the publisher's desire to circulate such rumors, if only a ploy to sell more copies, is a testament to the interface between this text's modernist and Orientalist impulses.</p>
<p>The most obvious sign of the French text's modern authorship lies in a comparison of the contents of the French volume and the Turkish manuscript. Notably, the French text creates out of whole cloth a number of portraits of boys of nationalities, countries, and cities not included in the late eighteenth-century Ottoman manuscript. These additions extend its Orientalist reach to include the <span style="font-style:italic;">beaux</span> of Ceylon, Java, Malaysa, China, and Borneo. Even more revealing is the fact that the French volume <span style="font-style:italic;">omits</span> all the portraits of Western youth who re as objects of desire in Fā. zil's taxonomy (including French, Austrian, Dutch, British, Spanish, Russian, and New World lads). Evidently the French author-translator assumed that such Occidental objects of desire were not "foreign" enough to meet the exotic expectations of a select European homophilic readership in quest of Orientalist thrills. Another suspect element is the pseudonym that the modern volume's introduction gives to "<span style="font-style:italic;">notre eminent collaborateur</span>," the purported translator working from the original: <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacha à Trois Queues</span>. Literally, the term refers to Turkish nobles who are allowed to use three rows, or lines ("<span style="font-style:italic;">queues</span>") of horses to draw their equipages. But as Aldrich correctly notes, and as turn-of-the-century French readers would know, this pseudonym puns upon the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">queue</span> is a vernacular term for "cock." Thus the "third line" or limb of the pasha, dangling as it were between his two other limbs or legs, is his penis.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The fact that our "Pacha" is said to be a Turkish native living in Paris and a bibliophile who has disguised himself in an array of native costumes to gather information about the "<span style="font-style:italic;">Beaux de toutes les contrées d'Islam</span>" provides another hint that the "Pacha" is a fiction, a front for the knowing author who has no doubt read his Sir Richard Burton.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>This trail of evidence suggests that the anonymous begetter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> was a European <span style="font-style:italic;">belle lettrist</span> familiar enough with a copy of the actual <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  render a convincing imitation: clearly, he is an erudite Orientalist, knowledgeable in the tropes of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> poetry, capable of making sometimes telling distinctions among various Middle Eastern cultures and customs. And he's a fairly talented writer as well, creating impressionistic mood pieces in the form of prose-poems that approximate the metaphoric lyricism and arch knowingness of the verse originals.</p>
<p>The opening lines of "The Beauty of Baghdad" give a sense both of the author's familiarity with prior tradition and his tongue-in-cheek self-consciousness, both of which work to belie the volume's claim to be a faithful reproduction of the work of Fāżil Bey:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The boy from Baghdad is the Khan of smirks and sugar-sticks.</p>
<p>His cheek surpasses the fresh rose, and his lips new wine. His curls are of hyacinth and his eyebrow of black ermine.</p>
<p>He knows the divine <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights and a Night</span> by heart, a book which the Turks have the stupidity of scorning.</p>
<p>Alas! Where are the Abbasids and my exhilarating precursor Abu-Nuwas? In that epoch, Baghdad was the paradise of poets, jewelers, striplings, and lovers. Now, it's only a heap of ruins.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">While the second line repeats the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span>'s traditional tropes of male beauty (cheeks like fresh roses, lips like wine, and so forth)—several of which occur in the much longer opening metaphors unfolded by Fāżil Bey—the first line is pure invention, and its sardonic acknowledgment that the city's youngsters are not all hyacinth and roses (nor hardly "Khan[s]"), but adeptly smirking actors, puts the conventional description that follows into rative quotation marks. Likewise, the references to "my exhilarating" (and bisexual) precursor Abū Nuwās and the "divine" <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights</span> indicate a self-reflexive use of literary history, a deliberate establishment of lineage ("<span style="font-style:italic;">my</span> precursor"), and a retrospective irony typical of modernist aesthetics (modern Baghdad as a "waste land").<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The latter image of Baghdad as a bygone paradise now reduced to a heap of ruins is entirely the creation of the modern author. Further, this <span style="font-style:italic;">mise-en-scene</span> provides the springboard for what becomes the persona's highly idiosyncratic portrait of the working-class Baghdad youth he claims as his lover:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But choice adolescents still flow between the ruins, and mine, for example, a carpet merchant from the bazaar, excelling at the art of putting off till tomorrow things that should be done today, wins more money with his idle buttocks than a miller can produce of flour turning his grist-stone always</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The punning analogy between the boy's buttocks and the miller's grist-stone cleverly condenses an anecdote in Fāżil Bey's poem, in which the son of miller who has gone to Baghdad refuses to return home to claim his patrimony because he's found that selling his "ass" in the big city is much more profitable than grinding flour. In fact, this bawdy anecdote is original neither to Fāżil Bey nor his purported translator—a version penned <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  four centuries earlier is included in al-Tīfashi's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delight of Hearts</span>.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> What follows for the rest of the portrait, however—the depiction of a sexual tryst between speaker and the Baghdad boy—is woven whole-cloth from the modern author's imagination:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We became acquainted with each other, he and I, in a narrow alley: there was, at the front of our impromptu chamber, an old wall without window, scaling and rough; and as we rested, he seemed to see in the protruding stone the outlines of res: there, the beautiful Zummurad, and there, the young jaundiced man, and there the sympathetic adulterer and Princess Nouranhour [characters from <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights</span>]; and our reverie followed their nighttime steps as they traversed the old capital of Al-Rachid, the wild one; his grand vizier, Giafar, uneasy in his thoughts; and the eunuch Massrour who rolls his white eyes</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31-2).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The dream of Baghdad's past grandeur is thus conjured up as a dream itself, a dream shared between sexual partners in a post-coital reverie in a realistically-drawn, debris-strewn alley where the Baghdad boy uses his imagination to create literary magic from a crumbling wall. This nostalgia for vanished greatness is at once a familiar Orientalist trope <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a sentiment common to the poetry of the 'Abbasids and Abū Nuwās; the existential rue in the 1909 speaker's juxtaposition of ephemerality (the tryst) and timelessness (the immortality of art) strikes a resolutely modernist note. Likewise, the coitus between poet and youth adds a level of erotic immediacy and empathy that, in contrast to Orientalist stereotype, complicates the hierarchies of subject/object. For, in the end, the lyric expression grants the boy an even greater inner life than the speaker—indeed, the last line leaves the reader inside the world of the boy's imagination, in a continuous present where, as the shift in verb tenses indicates, Massrour still "rolls his white eyes."</p>
<p>The climactic portrait in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, describing the Byzantium boy of Istanbul, captures the melding of the stock images of beauty expected of all Middle Eastern love poetry, the realistic grace-notes and glimpses of urban local color typical of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> genre, and an almost postcolonial understanding of the melancholies of dispossession and the operation of what Homi K. Bahba has called native mimicry.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> In the following lines, the youth—who turns out to be a dancing-boy, a profession associated with sexual availability throughout the Middle East—is following some prospective, lewd "clients" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">Francs lubriques</span>") up the hill of Galata, the Greek and European quarter of Istanbul where, since the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, homosexual trysts between Turks, as well as between Turks and foreigners, most often occurred:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The Greek boy descended from the Byzantines unites the eternal perfection and precision of form, the grace of ancient times, and a certain modern melancholy.</p>
<p>. . . As this stripling ascends Galata this morning under the splendor of an azure, sun-filled sky, trailing a group of lewd Franks, one of the latter comments that God must have created the boy from a divine blueprint encompassing all the delicacies born of the Mediterranean.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Imitating the traditional genre's mingling of high and low, the text next juxtaposes its universalizing description of this youth's beauty (his "eternal perfection" unites aspects of the entire Mediterranean) with a series of dashes of local color entirely original to the French text designed to evoke his earthy materiality and the immediacy of his daily existence:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Encircled by blockheads, curs, pickpockets, and Effendis in a string, he holds, from one hand, by its tied talons, a living goose and, in the other, he carries to his violet lips a flaky gateau glistening with honey.</p>
<p>. . . He has a delicate flaw in his way of pronunciation, though: he can't pronounce "ch": for <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacha</span> he lisps <span style="font-style:italic;">Passa</span>.</p>
<p>This is a small blemish, one that makes for piquant ambiguities: for <span style="font-style:italic;">chic</span> he says <span style="font-style:italic;">sik</span>; so much the better!"</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 77-8).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">So much the better, in the writer's opinion, because <span style="font-style:italic;">sik</span> is Arab slang for "cock." This pun is another clue to the portrait's European, modern provenance; for the pun only exists if one is speaking in French ("chic" for "sik").<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In a jaunty tone, the narrator assures his reader that, even if the market were to suffer a down-turn, this cocky Byzantium beauty would always be in demand among his admirers, both Ottoman and Franks. But almost immediately the portrait begins to grow darker, as narrator moves into the interior viewpoint of the boy himself:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>With reason, he abhors Turks to the bottom of his heart, but he dissimulates with the ease of a jaded diplomat, and he abides peaceably among their symposia of voluptuaries—those sons of Osman whom he wishes God would banish from Grand Constantinople</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 78).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The sudden interjection of this boy's hatred of Turks, along with the sardonic reference to the "jaded" profession of diplomacy, permits the narrator cleverly to evoke both the Ottoman Empire by which this descendent of Byzantium feels oppressed <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the practiced arts of disguise that allow this youth to veil his true feelings about the "sons of Osman" who seek out his sexual services.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This turn makes for the portrait's final, almost shocking shift in tone:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>If the opportunity were to present itself, he would wrench baby Muslims from the wombs of their mothers: in reality he restrains himself from such ruin, dancing instead in the taverns of Galata for all the bigots of d'Eyoub</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 78).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The fact that d'Eyoub is a conservative Muslim suburb of Istanbul drives home the point that many of the boy's pleasure-seeking patrons in Galata aren't just "Franks" but are Turks, "sons of Osman." Whatever the overall Orientalising tendencies of this twentieth-century free improvisation on the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> original, its portrait of the Byzantium youth <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> provides an acute, even poignant analysis of the psychological workings of colonialism, in this case from the point of view of one of the peoples subsumed under Ottoman rule after the conquest of Greek Constantinople in 1453. The <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  lingering resentments of this conquest contribute to the "modern melancholy" (line 1) of contemporary, ethnically diverse Istanbul depicted in this prose-poem (such melancholy, or <span style="font-style:italic;">huzun</span>, is also central to Orhan Pamuk's memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Istanbul: Memories and the City</span><sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup>), and the residue of this legacy permeates the ambiguous erotics whereby the Greek dancing boy allows himself to be the erotic darling of Franks and Muslims alike, as a cover for the profound hatred he really feels. In such instances, the modernist self-reflexivity accompanying this text's homoerotic thematics makes for an unexpectedly keen insight that pierces its Orientalist facade.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>The pseudo-scholarly apparatus that accompanies <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, including biographical preface and seemingly recondite footnotes, is a trademark of the burgeoning fields of anthropology and sexology from the turn of the century up to the 1930s. Often citing Sir Richard Burton as their inspiration, these texts compose what Schick in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Erotic Margin</span> calls "ethnopornography," a distinctive genre in which citation serves as the pretext for prurient accounts of exotic otherness. The sexual explicitness that characterizes much of literary modernism's rebellion against Victorian prudery gained its traction in part because of the influx of such pseudo-scientific publications into the marketplace, and in part because of those printers and publishers on the Continent interested in profiting from such sexually explicit examples of Orientalist erotica.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Boasting titles such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Turkish Art of Love</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Amour aux colonies</span> (1893; translated into English as "Untrodden Fields of Anthropology"), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Plague of Lust</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Moeurs Orientales: Le Huis-close de l'ethnographie</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthropological and Ethnological Studies in the Strangest Sexual Acts in Modes of Love of All Races</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Darkest Orient</span> , these "studies" anachronistically mix source materials from multiple time periods and cultures in order to create the image of an unchanging, timeless "Oriental sexuality." Significantly for our purposes, this ethnopornography also included numerous hoaxes parading (like <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>) as original work: purported translations of ancient Eastern erotica, discovered manuscripts, imprints claiming to have been published in Constantinople by non-existent presses to lend authority to their specious accounts, and the like.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Orientalist tradition of the faked translation is not new; Montesquieu exploited the format in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lettres persanes</span> , written in the voices of two fictional Persian correspondents traveling throughout Europe; Petit de la Croix produced an entirely fictional "translation" of "Arabic" tales under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Mille et un jours</span>  into order to capitalize on the success of Galland's <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Mille et une nuits</span>. What is new about these early-twentieth-century hoaxes is the degree of their sexual explicitness, which owes both to the war on prudery waged by literary modernists and the expanding field of ethnology. What is also new is the range of visual modes of ethnopornography available to such writers.</p>
<p>From the turn of the twentieth century on, various European entrepreneurs began producing erotic photographic images of North Africa and Middle East. Although such photography often purported to be "scientific," its goal was to cater to Europeans' sexual <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fantasies of exoticism, as Malek Alloula has demonstrated in his analysis of erotic post-cards in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Colonial Harem</span>.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Alloula dwells on the proliferation of images of nude women from the Maghreb, linking the scopophilic desire to peek inside the forbidden harem to the colonial imperative to master the colonized other. Less widely known is the thriving commerce in homoerotic images of Egyptian and North African male youth in the decades that Wilde, Forster, and Gide, among others, were seeking, and finding, sexual fulfillment in these regions. Baron Wilhelm Von Gloeden is best known for his vast photographic archive (some 7000 plates) in which boys of Taormina, Sicily, are posed nude and near-nude in what Roland Barthes identifies as kitsch Hellenic trappings in open-air tableaux.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> But Von Gloeden also dabbled in non-Hellenic modes of Orientalist homoerotica, contact sheets of which were mailed to the Baron's discrete homosexual clientele all over Europe. From such visual catalogues, his customers could select the images they wanted to purchase (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>). Although such photographs were originally slated for private collectors, Gert Schiff notes that they quickly "found their way into the most respected periodicals dedicated to photography, art, or ethnology," making the Baron a rich man.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>

<p>I want to propose that these contact sheets serve as modern-day, western, <span style="font-style:italic;">visual</span> equivalents of the poetic genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, offering a catalogue, in pictorial rather <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  than poetic form, of the supposedly available boys of the Middle East. Each individual image is crafted to intimate a story in which homoerotic desire and foreign otherness reinforce each other. But the mechanisms of representation complicate these portraits in unpredictable ways. In <a name="4-text" href="#4">re 14</a>, from the series "Ahmed 1890-1900," the pensive dark eyes of its subject gaze back at the camera from under an Arabic headdress, soliciting the spectator's gaze. To the degree that the eloquence of the boy's eyes seem to speak for some truth of self, this particular <span style="font-style:italic;">mise-en-scene</span> succeeds in eclipsing the reality lying behind that gaze: the fact is that "Ahmed" is in fact a Sicilian youth dressed up as an Arab—this is the "nearly" Middle East of Orientalist fantasy indeed. No doubt his headdress is one that von Gloeden pulled out of his costume box, given that a similar one appears in the photographer's own self-portrait, titled, ironically enough, "Il Moro" (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 15</a>).<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> In a second re from this series, the same model's robes have</p>

In contrast to Sicilian youths dressed up as Arabs, Von Gloeden shot one series, "Junger Araber," on location in Algeria, but the fact that he is using natives as his models on this occasion does not mean the images are any the less aestheticized or posed. These photographs make the most of the handsome features of its subjects, as the artful profile of the mascaraed young man in <a name="7-text" href="#7"> 17</a> and the muscular, raised arm of the turbaned man in <a name="7-text" href="#7"> 18</a> attest. The Orientalist obsession with tropes of veiling and unveiling, associated in the literature with the unseen mysteries of the female harem, is given an explicitly homoerotic, pederastic twist in one photograph in which the transparent "veil" draped over the model's body only emphasizes the fact that his anatomy is fully visible. The combination of Hellenic and Middle Eastern iconography in <a name="7-text" href="#7">re 19</a> creates an aura of sensual languor that could <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  exist anywhere in the southern Mediterranean: such a stripping of cultural specificity is part and parcel of the traditional machinery of Orientalism.</p>

<p>Ethnopornographic photography was also a specialty of the team of Rudolph Lehnert and Ernst Landrock, who established studios in Tunis and Cairo from 1905-30. Revealing a much more discerning eye for nuances of lighting, shadow, frame, and perspective than von Gloeden, photographer Lehnert shot everything from antiquities to nudes to feed a growing European appetite for visual representations of exoticism and difference. The fact that he worked on location, using indigenous models, might seem to give his work a greater stamp of ethnographic authenticity. But his subjects are as staged as those of von Gloeden in order to satisfy the tastes and predetermined fantasies of his audience. Of particular interest are two shots of one model wearing the same head-dress but different robes in different settings (<a name="0-text" href="#0">. 20 and 21</a>). One source labels the first image "Cairo 1910," another labels the second image "1904," yet another identifies the first as "Tunis 1910" and yet two more poses by the same model as "Tunis 1904"—whereas all were obviously photographed in the same time and place (the correct identification is "Tunis 1904"). This discrepancy tells us something about the spatial-temporal transportability of the erotic fantasy of the sexually available <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The taboo of race rather than age is breached in a series of rare plates titled "La Seduction" (Tunis 1907), where two adult men, one indigenous and one European, engage in erotic couplings in the outdoors; the noticeably darker Tunisian is at the service of his colonial master in each image. Other studios, such as J. Geiser, also circulated postcard images ranging from young boys (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 23</a>) to strikingly handsome Bedouins (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 24</a>). Not unlike the function that <span style="font-style:italic;">sehrengiz</span> verse catalogues filled for an earlier Middle Eastern culture, the genre of the homoerotic photograph catered to the fantasy among its European clientele that a cornucopia of riches in the shape of male beauties awaited for the taking in North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>The youthful male object of desire—along with the anxieties that his inconstancy may produce in his admirer—forms the through-line of Aleister Crowley's faux-Persian poem sequence, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden of Abdulah the Satirist of Shiraz</span>. This pornographic <span style="font-style:italic;">jeu d'esprit</span> appeared in 1910, the same period in which homoerotic postcards such as those produced by Lehnert and Landrock were traversing Europe and England. Notorious in his day as an occultist, experimenter in mind-altering drugs, and proponent of "sex magick," Crowley was also a voluminous writer, producing treatises on mysticism, books of sacred revelations, experimental fiction ("novelissim"), plays, and collections of poetry ranging from the pornographic to the spiritual. Although Crowley is largely forgotten today, aficionados keep his memory alive: the Beatles featured him as one of the cut-outs on the cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span>, and he lives on in various graphic novels and comic books that dabble in the occult. Crowley entered Cambridge in 1895, the year the Wilde trials began, where he was exposed to the Decadent movement in literature, explored his bisexuality, and became involved (like Yeats) in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. While in Egypt in 1904, he had a mystical experience in which his invocation of Horus led to a vision in which the god appeared and dictated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of the Law</span>, much of it in numerical cipher, which Crowley made the foundation of his religious philosophy Thelema.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> In Nepal Crowley set about studying the Persian language and Sufi doctrines when he decided to return to England via Iran. As part of his study, he began composing poems in imitation of the classical Persian poets. These efforts inspired the interconnected series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> published in 1910 as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden</span>, purported to be the mystic writings of one "Abdullah al Haji" (circa 1600 A.D.).</p>
<p>This ribald collection of homoerotic verse, like other modernist texts whose English authors feared the Home Office's censorship, was typeset in Paris, then made available in England by subscription through the London Orientalist Probsthain and Company in a limited edition of 200. The era was a touchstone for modernist battles against censorship, of course—Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was seized by New York Customs in 1923, Woolf <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and Forster testified at the obscenity trial of Radclyffe Hall's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Well of Loneliness</span> in 1928. The prospectus of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Perfumed Garden</span> bore the teasing disclaimer, "As typical of erotic literature, the circulation will be most strictly confined to bonafide scholars of mysticism, anthropology, and the like"—although it doesn't take much to imagine the clientele to whom "the like" refers (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 10). Nor did the winking claim of scholarly intent fool the HM Customs office, which confiscated the volume in 1924, destroying nearly all extant copies in 1926.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>If <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> disguises its modernist provenance by claiming to be a straightforward translation of Fāżil Bey, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden</span> wears its pretext much more lightly. Purporting on the title page to be the translation of a "rare . . . manuscript by the Late Major Lutiy and Another," the text is self-consciously structured, as Martin P. Starr puts it, as "a series of veils" that can only be penetrated by those readers of "empathetic interests" who possess the keys to unlock its knowledge (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 5). The reader's first clue that this is an invention for a homosexual coterie, much in the same spirit as Djuna Barnes's equally genre-defying <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies Almanack</span> , is the suggestive tone of the dedication that follows the table of contents. Utilizing a series of phallic metaphors, the fictitious translator, Major Lutiy dedicates the book "to those persons whose unbending uprightness, penetration, retentiveness, capacity for hard work, overflowing ability, and inside knowledge have so much enlarged the fundamental basis of my philosophy"—a philosophy literally grounded in the "fundament" or anus of the poems' beloved, a not-altogether-faithful Persian boy named Habib (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, n.p.). A second clue to the volume's status as a hoax exists in Major Lutiy's name: <span style="font-style:italic;">liwat</span> is Arab for sodomy, and a <span style="font-style:italic;">luti</span> is the active partner in the act of pederasty. A third key emerges in the fictive Lutiy's account of the discovered volume in his introduction. Stationed in "Mohammedan India" (and thereby adding to the colonialist <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span>), the Major hires an instructor to teach him Persian—a tutor whose last name is "Tantra," a sly allusion to the Eastern practice in which sexual intercourse leads to the mystical expansion of self.</p>
<p>As Lutiy also reveals in the introduction, his tutor is so impressed that his pupil hasn't, like other exploitative Anglos, peremptorily bid him "procure . . . a fat and fair boy" for his amusement, that he freely gives Lutiy something even better, namely "a sacred and secret" manuscript expressed, as Crowley puts it with a poker face in his autobiography, "in the symbolism of Persian piety."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> This manuscript, purportedly dating circa 1600 A.D., is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> (which translates "The Scented Garden"<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup>). The author of this "manuscript" is Abdullah el Haji—like Lutiy, yet another fictional construct—whose over-the-top poetic name or <span style="font-style:italic;">Takhallus</span>, El Qahar, translates "The Conqueror." The text's 42 <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> have been shuffled out of order, so Lutiy reports, but soon enough he discovers the key to their arrangement, thereby unlocking a "complete system of philosophy" in which nothing less than pederasty becomes <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> means of attaining transcendent Oneness. Citing his "very handy" knowledge of Burton's writings—a nod to the homosexual cognoscenti for whom Burton was as much a touchstone as Wilde—the fictional Lutiy presents the reader with a "translation" of this mystical text accompanied by scholarly apparatus: footnotes, footnotes within footnotes, the singling out of stanzas <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of spurious authorship (in what is itself a totally spurious text), and—the joke of all jokes—an appended essay by a fictional Anglican clergyman living in Mandalay who pleads in florid language for an understanding of the spiritual excellencies of pederasty (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 3). The good clergyman also makes an implicit case for proto-modernist writing when he links artists who care about form and style to homosexual men as equally elect minorities: "A stylist is as direct a miracle of God as a sodomite." The artist's "perfect freemasonry of style and manner" echoes Lutiy's description in his introduction of that "Freemasonry of Paederasts" who recognize each other instinctively, "mak[ing] the formality of introduction superfluous among free companions of the Craft"—a brotherhood that makes sure its "secret" doctrines, such as those revealed in el Haji's sacred text, remain the exclusive "property" of those elected ones "worthy of it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 30; 12-13). Indeed, Lutiy claims the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> manuscript has only been passed on to him because Tantra has recognized him to be "one of the <span style="font-style:italic;">illuminati</span>," that is, one with whom such contraband knowledge will be safe. The "Craft[s]" of the Artist and Pederast are thus teasingly interwoven in the fictive Lutiy's preemptive defense of the sexually explicit contents of his translation, serving notice to those "notoriously foul-minded Anglo-Saxon[s]" who would dare subject the manuscript's "exquisitely sacred" symbolism to "the prurient jest or prudish reproach."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>Halfway through the introduction, Lutiy also reveals that he has teamed up with another scholar (only referred to as "Another" on the title page), whose duty it is "to cover ethnographical, critical, and other interesting points"—a self-reflexive nod to the ethnopornographic traditions described in the prior section, even as the scholarly talents of this collaborator are called into question by his familiarity with those "<span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> interesting points" (which become all the more sexually suggestive for going unnamed) (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 10). An even more dizzying play of text, intertext, and countertext is created midway through this introduction when, in a parenthesis, this second personage informs the reader "Lutiy" has died! Thus he has taken over the editorship of the manuscript, adding his own footnotes to Lutiy's. Finally, a bracket at the very end of the introduction informs the reader that the Major's name, "Lutiy," is in fact a <span style="font-style:italic;">nom-de-plume</span> that the current (anonymous) editor has retained in deference to the wishes of the late Major's widow. No ground of origins or authorship remains stable in this <span style="font-style:italic;">jeu d'esprit</span>.</p>
<p>As in a Nabokovian text, the notes are as much part of the text's fun as the poems they gloss. They parody both the kind of note that Burton supplies in his work to add irrelevant but titillating detail and the pseudo-scholarly citation that ethnopornographers use to throw sand in the eyes their readers. They serve, too, to show off the author's depth of Orientalist knowledge as he teases out word-plays in the (non-existent) Persian text by setting calligraphic equivalents next to each other.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> The notes also parody the esoteric nature and excesses of literary criticism, especially in glosses where Lutiy and the unnamed second Editor assign wildly improbable "allegorical" meanings to sexual passages that are anything but spiritual. The sublimely ridiculous level to which such notes aspire is illustrated in poem 35, where El Qahar boasts of his member rising and falling a thousand times in one night of passion. Fumes "A.L." in the note: "Surely an Oriental exaggeration!" His successor, the second Editor, disagrees in a parenthesis he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  adds <span style="font-style:italic;">inside</span> Lutiy's note: "Not at all. I do not think El Haji necessarily means separate and distinct emissions; he may mean thrusts." Thereupon he calculates the number of thrusts-per-minute it would take to fulfill this requirement, concluding that El Qahar could have reasonably thrust 1000 times in four hours and ten minutes—a not unreasonable length of time for one practiced in the arts of tantric self-control (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 111)!</p>
<p>So much for the notes; what of the poem sequence itself? While the format is evocative of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, Crowley's sequence of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> focuses on a single erotic object, El Qahar's fifteen-year-old paramour Habib, rather than on a series of boys. More specifically, the sequence focuses on Habib's anus—or, in Crowley's preferred Latinate term, his podex. However wildly implausible it might seem to dedicate an entire volume to so "fundamental" a subject as the fundament, Crowley succeeds by giving the series of poems an arc reminiscent of the sonnet sequences of Wyatt, Sydney, and Shakespeare. The initial euphoria of all-consuming passion is followed by Habib's sexual betrayals and jealousy-inducing triangulation; El Qahar's torment and dejection yields to the sadistic reassertion of supremacy over his straying beloved. In turn, their reunion reinstates love's necessary illusion, which ironically means El Qahar's maintaining the fiction of the unblemished, rosebud-like delicacy of his beloved's podex after declaring it has been stretched impossibly wide by the boy's wanton behavior.</p>
<p>Crowley's playfulness in mixing the sacred and profane, and in bending traditional Persian and Sufi metaphors to his queer ends, achieves a kind of mastery in poem 6, whose title, "The Curtain," alludes to the hidden mysteries of the Greater Reality. The italicized summary running across the top of the page—"The Impotence of Thought to perceive Reality"—provides a clue to the poem's thematic: the true path to transcendent Reality, the still center of the spinning world, lies not in the mind but in an altogether more "fundamental" realm, one in which achieving potency is no problem at all:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Thy podex, like a rose, within<br>Thy buttocks, sprays of Jessamine,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Buds to my kisses; then the wine<br>Sets this old head of mine a-spin,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>So that I push thee to thy knees—<br>A worship, darling, not a sin. . . .</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such mixture of the sacred and profane—worshipping the uplifted buttocks of what could otherwise be a youth kneeling to pray—is typical of the Persian masters that Crowley is imitating; simultaneously it heightens the poem's modernist impulse to shock and titillate. In the immediately following lines, El Qahar bemoans the fact that no matter how deep he plunges, he cannot reach Habib's "Self," the hidden "real," as long as he is consumed by thought. Thereupon he draws the following distinction between reason and feeling: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Sex, not thought, is what sets the wheel of life spinning again, just as Habib's podex, the still point at the center of his swinging buttocks, turns out to be the pivot of the spinning world. If continual intercourse with Habib is the true vehicle to transcendent knowledge, all the more reason, the poet implies, to "once more begin!"<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>For all this sexual bravado, however, Crowley uses the occasion of Habib's infidelities to poke fun at universal male anxieties about prowess, virility, and size. El Qahar's greatest fear is that Habib is attracted to his other suitors because they are better endowed, which makes it all the more imperative that, upon Habib's contrite return, El Qahar re-instate the fantasy of his own phallic supremacy: "It is indeed the fact, O gazelle-eyed boy, that thy podex is excessively wide"—stretched, that is, by all his infidelities—"but my member can fill it . . . !", whereupon El Qahar proceeds to tell his readers why in graphic terms (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 70). Once joined together in intercourse, he rhapsodically assures Habib that their identities will dissolve, as in Sufi doctrine, into one greater unity as they enter</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ironically, such a blurring of sexual positions becomes the punch-line of the entire 42-poem sequence. Having secured Habib's properly abject devotion, the speaker in poem 41, "The Riddle," reveals that he is ready for Habib to slip <span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> boyish "almond member . . . in the podex of thine El Qahar" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 135). For the first time we learn that this conqueror, hitherto all cock and swagger, also has a podex. His secret desire to be pummeled by his boy provides the key, then, that unlocks the sequence's final sacred mystery, and as such becomes the fitting climax of the volume. "The end" (of the volume), in this case, <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> the "end" (the poet's derriere), the textual and the sexual complementing each other rather perfectly in this odd gem of an eccentrically modernist, playfully punning, obscenely exuberant text. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">V</h1>
<p>Another writer who fits intriguingly into this modernist revision of traditional Middle Eastern erotic verse forms is the Dutch Jewish lawyer, diplomat, novelist, and poet Jacob Israel de Haan (1881-1924), a married gay man and eventual émigré to Palestine. Like Crowley, De Haan was influenced by the Decadent movement in his university years, and, while beginning a career as teacher and journalist, wrote two novels in the first decade of the twentieth century filled with <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> decadence, homoerotic angst, and class rebellion. The first, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pijpelijntjes</span> ("Pipelines" or "Lines from Pjip," 1904), featuring a promiscuous lover of male youth, led to De Haan's dismissal from his teaching position; the title not only puns on the industrial slum of Amsterdam (Pijp) but—in the spirit of Crowley's lewdly modernist word-plays—tropes on the colloquial Dutch term (<span style="font-style:italic;">pijpen</span>) for fellatio. The second novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pathologieen</span> , plumbs the depths of a sadomasochistic, homosexual relationship. Completing law studies around this time, De Haan began to research the mass imprisonment of Jews in Tsarist Russia, which in turn inaugurated his growing interest in Zionism. Upon emigrating to Palestine in 1919, however, De Haan grew disillusioned with what he perceived as the Zionist party's antagonism to Orthodox Jews and Arabs alike. Shortly thereafter, he became a leading spokesperson for the ultra-Orthodox Haredim, a group whose willingness to broker a reconciliation of Jewish and Arab interests in Mandate Palestine pitted them against the secular and nationalist interests of the Zionist faction.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>The consequence was De Haan's political assassination at the age of 43, the year his final volume of poems, <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwatrijnen</span> ("Quatrains"; 1924), appeared. Containing some 900 quatrains written in the Persian <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> form in Dutch, the volume charts an interior voyage of discovery, one in which a spiritual quest to Palestine unlocks a sensual odyssey in which the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>'s celebration of pleasure combines with themes particular to De Haan's psychology: his obsession with fleeting time and the inevitability of death, mood swings between restlessness (<span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span> is one of his most repeated words) and states of peace, a tendency to masochism, existential despair, and solitude. But what gives this poetic journey of spiritual and sensual revelation its <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> is the frank degree to which De Haan turns the Holy Land into a homosexual cruising grounds where the objects of his desire are literally "others": Arab and Muslim boys from east Jerusalem and the surrounding Palestinian countryside.</p>
<p>"Doubt" is one of many quatrains in which the poet uses self-reflexive irony to foreground the dialectic between homoerotic desire and questions of faith:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>What awaits me in this evening hour,<br>In this City stalked by sleep,<br>Seated on the Temple wall:<br>God, or the Moroccan lad?<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">De Haan's eroticized response to a boy being bathed in "Hassan" inspires an equally jarring collapse of the sacred and profane: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>His mother rid him of his clothes<br>The water ripples in the tiny bath.<br>My heart trembles, in a shunned softening of endearment,<br>Is not Jerusalem God's holy city?<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The modernist shock-effect of such sacrilegious juxtapositions combines with a self-awareness of the traditional tropes of <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> verse throughout the volume. In "Nederval," for example, "lofty" prayer is abjured for lower pleasures as the poet boasts, "I turn from my lofty prayers / With restlessness burning in my limbs / To wine and pleasure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 157). The words "wine and pleasure" evoke, of course, Omar Khayyam, the twelfth-century master of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> form whom De Haan acknowledges as his great predecessor in several quatrains. The degree to which De Haan is deliberately rewriting Khayyam in a modernist vein is apparent in the strategic replacement of the "women" of "wine, women, and song" with other sensations, as in the phrase "wine, music, and <span style="font-style:italic;">roses</span>" or "roses, <span style="font-style:italic;">thorns</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">blood</span>."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> This elision clears room for De Haan's male-directed desires to emerge—along with the pained anguish that is never far removed from the momentary pleasures he grasps:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>If we die this night, die from it all,<br>This tender night, would that not be the greatest pleasure of all?<br>What more can we possibly gain from wandering through this life<br>Than a bit more happiness and pain?<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In another quatrain (also titled "Night") the motifs of roses, wine, and pleasure/pain combine with the imagery of probing hands to imbue the lines with an implied phallicism:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>The boldly probing whoredom of your tender hands.<br>The darkness . . . smelling of roses and of wine.<br>Tomorrow will brand us once again with cruel remorse.<br>But for today: blessed pleasure be ours.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 169)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Other quatrains forthrightly declare the male gender and youth of the desired object. In "Meeting," the speaker begins, "I ask his years. He smiles shyly and tenderly. / He blushes. Then he says 'fifteen years' . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 65). In "Bedouin," the poet watches a group of Arab boys frolicking in the ocean—"They stand naked in their brown fragility, / From head to toe slender built"—and then projects onto them an utter lack of "shame or shamelessness" that transforms their innocence into an implicit statement of his own adult shame as he "contemplat[es]" their nude bodies (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 103). If such instances of psychological projection and erotic voyeurism are standard features of Orientalism, De Haan's quatrains are also remarkable for his unsentimental acknowledgment of the gap separating himself from his desired objects. "Arab Boys," also from this sequence, shows De Haan's self-critical perception of his ultimate status as the outsider, the "other" who lacks a home both existentially and geographically: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>What do they have except for their nakedness and their clothes,<br>The breadth of the sea and beach?<br>Meanwhile joy and anguish consume my heart,<br>Restlessness propelling me through each and every land.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 106)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, the speaker's inner emotions are "consumed" by the gulf that separates him from these desirable youth—the gulf that, no matter how many trysts he consummates, will always leave <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span> the homeless wanderer, moving with "restlessness" from one "land" to another, alone and unsatisfied.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p>
<p>The portraits of desirable boys that are sprinkled throughout the 900 quatrains of the volume form a modern-day <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> of the available youth of Palestine. But like the two portraits from <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> examined in section II, De Haan's quatrains sometimes brutually critique the Orientalism of his own erotics:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>With Adil I have ridden horses,<br>With Said I've shared the forbidden wine.<br>With Mahmoud . . . with Nasief . . . I stretch out my limbs<br>Restlessly, in cruel agony.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 187)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The title tells it all: "The Night Ahead." By the third line, the acts shared drop out, only the names remain, then the names cease, since they could go on forever but without filling the void in De Haan's heart. For no matter how many loves he has enjoyed, the boys names ultimately form a chain of interchangeable signifiers beneath which the signified, desire itself, slips away. This absence leaves the poet in an agony of unfulfillment or "restlessness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span>)—and, on this particular night, such unrest also leaves him dreading the hours ahead, in which he will either extend his arms to embrace emptiness or—equally daunting—encounter yet another name in an endless chain. A similar logic governs "Suffering," the quatrain that immediately follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>With Adil . . .with Mahmoud, driven by lust,<br>With Hassan, with Khalil, drinking together.<br>I've always remained the same, alas:<br>Alone, and just another name.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 187)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, the modernist appropriation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>'s form and content yields a quintessentially modernist insight: while the boys continually replace one another in this mobile chain of desire, De Haan is doomed to sameness, to imprisonment in his own singular consciousness ("I've always remained the same"). He himself is "just another name," the marker of this doomed identity; yet, inversely and ironically, De Haan too is just one more "name" in the litany of encounters that each of these boys has had, as dispensable to these boys as they are, in fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span>-dispensable to his fantasy of fulfillment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For De Haan, as for Crowley and the anonymous imitator of Fā z.il Bey, Middle Eastern poetic forms and literary tropes become the avenue for modernist revision and homoerotic expression. In De Haan's case, this expression is the poetic record of the very real, and often agonizing, dichotomies marking his own personal quest: as a married man who was also homosexual, as a European aesthete who made his ultimate home in the Middle East, as a diplomat attempting to forge alliances between Zionist hopes and Palestine rights, and, ultimately, as an Orthodox Jew finding sexual fulfillment with Arab youths whose physical proximity yet existential distance only increased the ceaseless movement of his soul's <span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">VI</h1>
<p>Like De Haan's emigration to Palestine, André Gide's literary record of North Africa as a site of sexual awakening is grounded in experience, not merely fantasy; he traveled to Tunisia and Algeria six times before publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas: A North African Journal</span> in 1906.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> consists of four short journals spanning 1899-1904, in the midst of which Gide published the 1902 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span>, which discloses a narrative of pederastic awakening beneath a veneer of reticence and veiled allusion. In its way, <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span> constitutes a <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> in modernist novelistic form, as its narrator, Michel, takes up and discards a series of adolescent local boys while succumbing to the influence of a torrid African landscape that penetrates "the most . . . secret fibers of [his] being."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Gide achieves an equivalent kind of cataloguing, but of a very different aesthetic order, in the intensely lyrical <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>. Composed of dozens of short, poetic evocations of North African landscapes and cities, this travel journal discloses a voyage of homoerotic awakening and bliss, in spite of the fact that these journal notes are often void of any human re—no parade of interchangeable Arab youth as in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span> or De Haan's <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwatrijnen</span>. What Gide seeks to achieve in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> is nothing less than a modernist revision of the genre of travel narrative, recasting its realist attempts in lyrical fragments that become the vehicle for intense, if discrete, homoerotic expression. Whereas traditional travel narratives from the seventeenth-century on typically enumerate hundreds of pages of tedious detail in service of the impossible task of "authenticating" its record of the foreign and unfamiliar, Gide embraces, instead, the impressionistic subjectivity of the traveler's sensations, fixing them in lyrical glimpses that read as prose-poems. These poetic meditations draw on the evocative, rather than descriptive, power of language to convey the traveler's intimations of difference and discovery, of mystery and initiation, of losing one's bearings as one nears, without ever quite reaching, the otherness of one's own desires.</p>
<p>Further, Gide's prose in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> achieves a kind of photographic stillness, a sense of spots of time frozen in their immediacy, via its temporal structure. Not only are the four journals included in the slim volume arranged to move backwards and forwards in time, but the lyrical effusions of the entries—sometimes only a few lines long, often no more than half a page—weave back and forth in time, recollecting similar moments, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  revisiting old scenes, repeating tableaux from oblique angles of vision. The white gaps on the page separating these short effusions emphasize their discreteness as individual units while suggesting that there is always more that escapes the frame. As distinct from the generic fantasy of the "nearly Middle East" as a timeless space in which nothing ever changes, the slowing down of time for Gide is less Orientalizing than Woolfian: entering these snapshot moments, these verbally evocative pictures, allows a more profound perception of the very foreignness that the tradition of realist travel narrative attempted, but often failed, to capture through the piling on of excessive detail and the attempt to impose a comprehensive wholeness on the observed culture.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Gide doesn't also sometimes fetishize and exoticize difference—as when, for instance, he claims Tunis has lost the "intoxicating flavor of foreignness" that rivaled the "remotest Orient" and "the most secret Africa" a mere two years ago.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> But in general his projections onto North Africa intertwine with an empathetic perception of, respect for, and openness to the differences he encounters on his travels. For his deliberately unvarnished journal entries—each existing on its own, not reworked into a "<span style="font-style:italic;">more coherent whole</span>"—seek to capture an order of seeing and knowing distinct from that pursued by realism, attuning the reader to a different ontology of being in and interacting with unfamiliar cultures (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 60). What counts for Gide are the small details, the evanescent flashes of perception, the incidental moments that occur in the margins that his style of lyric minimalism, modernist indirection, and allusive suggestiveness works to evoke. "The distended void of the desert teaches the love of detail," he observes in a passage that suggests his artistic goal in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 146). Listening to a four-noted flute that is the only sign of life in a lonely oasis, Gide reiterates this minimalist aesthetic: "If only, from page to page, evoking four shifting tones, these sentences I am writing here might be for you what that flute was for me, what the desert was for me—of diverse monotony" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 138). "Diverse monotony" is the perfect enunciation of the state that Gide seeks to capture in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>: the plentitude that desire, if liberated from the constraints of rational thought, uncovers in a landscape that only <span style="font-style:italic;">seems</span> to be a blank slate.</p>
<p>Gide gilds his aesthetic intentions with a homoerotic frisson through a series of repeating images: half-open doors, glimpses briefly caught through openings, settings on the margins or by the "wayside," dreams of permeable boundaries, closed interiors. The labyrinthine streets, byways, and alleys of the North African medina have served for many European writers and travelers as symbols of the labyrinthine trajectories of the libido seething beneath the surface of consciousness. Similarly, Gide likens his traversal of the covered alleys of the souks of Tunis to entering a "subterranean" realm, "a second city in the city" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 15). The lure of anonymity and losing one's way in such mazes has an especially richly connotative power for the homoerotic male imagination, as the history of gay cruising suggests. This sensibility limns the sense of mystery in the Algerian streetscapes photographed by Gide's contemporary, F. Holland Day (<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 25 &amp; 26</a>), and it resonates in contemporary French-Tunisian artist Michel Giliberti's homoerotic evocation of passageways in Tunis (<a name="7-text" href="#7">. 27-31</a>).<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> So, too, in Gide's lyrical prose, doors, openings, and passages take on a charged libidinal valence, making <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> an intriguingly sensuous rewriting of the genre of travel narrative. In Gide's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">imagination, secret turns in a street, concealed niches in cafés, hidden staircases, and unseen exits become eroticized sites that hold the promise of unnamed desires that lie on the other side of such mysteriously alluring thresholds.</p>
<p>A paradigmatic example occurs in Gide's account of an evening stroll in Blida in the last section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>, "Travel Foregone." It is night and Gide is strolling down the street of the Ouled-Naïls or female prostitutes—a locus that allows an acceptable if illicit aura of overt sexuality to enter the narrative. Yet at the very moment "a woman was calling to me," ironically, his attention is diverted <span style="font-style:italic;">elsewhere</span>, to that which appears on the very margins of vision:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But the loveliest thing I saw that evening (in passing, and in the time it takes to blink . . .) through that open door traversed by my desire in a single bound, was a dark narrow garden I could barely make out . . . and further on, lit from behind, closing off a mysterious threshold, a luminous white curtain</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 99).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ignoring the call of the Ouled (and forgoing the salacious details one might find in other travel narratives), Gide responds to a modality of desire that exists "in the time it takes to blink": the fleeting vision of one threshold framed within the other, culminating in the tantalizingly "luminous white curtain" whose translucence intimates an unseen world of life glowing on the other side.</p>
<p>The opening lines of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> metaphorically take us across that luminous threshold, as Gide describes coming upon an opening in a craggy range of mountains near the oasis of El Kantara: "Here is the portal; we enter." What he finds on the other side of this "portal" (which is of course also this first page of text) is "a different world . . . alien, motionless, taciturn, . . . at peace." Beyond the sound of a flute and a child's laughter in the distance, Gide finds what he now realizes he has always desired but hitherto feared: "<span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span>; no misgivings, no thoughts. Not even repose: here nothing ever stirs. It is still" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 3; emphasis added). This is the stillness of a desire in which "diverse monotony" can yield its treasures; it is the "nothing" that exists once the mind lets go of its inhibitions and strictures. A few pages later, on one of his innumerable nightly "prowls," Gide recounts the breaching of a second "entrance," and this passage begins to disclose the sensual recompense that underlies the promise of entering a world of "nothing." "Of all the Arab cafés, I have chosen the darkest, the one most out of the way," he notes, then teasingly asks, "What draws me here? <span style="font-style:italic;">Nothing</span>; the shadows, a graceful body weaving round the room, a song—and not to be seen from outside: the solace of secrecy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 5; emphasis added). Gide's carefully chosen images reveal, indirectly, the attractions this particular locus holds. For by choosing the café that is "darkest" and "most out of the way," Gide gains, in the first instance, closeted anonymity—"the solace of secrecy," of not being seen "from the outside," as he puts it. If Gide's ostensible answer to his "What draws me here?" is "Nothing," the immediately following phrases reveal that this "Nothing" actually consists of at least two <span style="font-style:italic;">somethings</span>. First, there are "shadows," which in the pages that follow become the text's shorthand for Arab men moving through the night in their white robes; second, the "graceful body weaving round the room" is in fact a boy dancer performing for the café's male clientele. Gide's "nothings" turn out to be pregnant with unspoken but palpable homoeroticism.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The erotic thrill of discovering such remote places, particularly sites not patronized by other westerners, attains psychodramatic intensity in Gide's impressionistic renderings. In "Wayside Pages"—a section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>—he emphasizes the fact that he always uses "that other entrance, narrow and recessed" to the souk in Tunis, where "dim alleyway[s]" lead to equally "dim café[s]" whose seductive habitués, Sudanese men wearing sprigs of jasmine behind their ears, exude "voluptuous languor" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 17, 18). The French "cannot find such places," Gide writes with a sense of superiority, refashioning himself as the insider who knows how to spot the "low door" leading into the dark cubbyhole where spectators watching the "obscene" Karaghioz puppet show rent shadowy "niches" in the wall that serve as divans (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 19-20). The sexual undertones of such crannies become explicit as Gide describes, "another stall" where, he admits, the puppet "play is merely an excuse for encounters." Here, a "strangely lovely child" plays his bagpipes for an appreciative audience of male admirers whom Gide likens to "suitors" in "a kind of <span style="font-style:italic;">cour d'amour</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 20, 21). Such homoerotic connotations accumulate throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>. A different Arab town, a different night, a different year: deliberately avoiding the quarter's four or five brightly lit French cafes, Gide discovers a "suspect stairway" that leads to an "upper city" of the town, all darkened and inscrutable, where, following the sound of an Arab guitar, he discerns the "faint glow" of a "scarcely noticeable" Moorish café (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 69). Pausing in the darkness, he ponders, "Shall I go in? What will I see. . . [?]" Opting to stay outside, he calls upon "the night [to] penetrate me, insinuate itself with the music," just as—as if in answer to his desires—an Arab emerges from the café and "moves toward me" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 70).</p>
<p>If the rhetorical questions that the narrator poses—"What draws me here?", "Shall I go in?"—hinge on a fantasy of being penetrated by the worlds of difference imagined to lie beyond these mysterious portals, Gide also knows—and this is where his somber insight, like De Haan's, mitigates his nostalgic Orientalism—that such sentiments are part of an ultimately <span style="font-style:italic;">impossible</span> fantasy of leaving the known self behind and becoming the desired other. This awareness adds a note of melancholy to his yearning: "Oh, to know, when that thick black door opens in front of that Arab, what will welcome him behind it . . . I should like to be that Arab, I should like what awaits him to await me" (Gide's ellipses).<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> What Gide fantasizes awaiting behind the door is part of an dream of homoerotic jouissance that is at once <span style="font-style:italic;">secret</span>—uncontaminated by western disapproval—and <span style="font-style:italic;">open</span> to his participation, as open as the "gaping garments of the Arabs!" whom he apostrophizes in his last journal entry where, back in France, he dreams of "the desert spring" and the "Companions! Comrades!" he has left behind.</p>
<p>The evocation of desert companions raises the question of the place of actual paramours in Gide's entries. The homoerotic reimaginings of Crowley, De Haan, and the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, as we've seen, depend on the explicitly sexualized representation of available youth, often presented serially as interchangeable objects of desire. Every now and then, Gide's entries make mention of various males, but in general sexual corporeality is absent in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>—the highly autoerotic passages where Gide communes with nature in orgasmic frenzy are as close to "sex" as the text gets. And this overall <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> of embodied objects of desire forms what is most innovative, and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  interesting, about Gide's modernist reworking of travel narrative for homoerotic ends: his talent lies in being able to make the most insignificant of details or even inanimate objects—the glimpse of a mysterious rear door, the discovery of a room, the description of a lonely oasis—resonate with an unnamed, yet nonetheless pervasive, homoerotic sensibility. Stylistic indirection, fragmentation, and allusion—hallmark traits of literary modernism—work in tandem with Gide's narrative lyricism and episodic structure both to give tacit expression to his own desires <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> to suggest the opaque but nonetheless tangible layers of homoeroticism that pervade North African male culture.</p>
<p>The additive quality of these homoerotic tableaux, moreover, form a modern approximation of the poetic tradition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> by capturing, like pictures in an album, snapshot images of desire that may be savored in a future time. But whereas the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> and the camera typically operate by objectifying their subjects, the minimalist aesthetic underlying Gide's prose-poems—staking their claim on life in the margins, on the diversity that exists in seeming monotony—works against blatant appropriations of North Africa and likewise pushes against the European desire to possess the essence of "Oriental" sexuality. To the contrary: Gide intimates that the reader who really wants to understand his message must engage in a textual erotics that res the journal as an extension of Gide's queer body: "Publish [these entries]—for whom?," Gide ponders back in France, "They will be like those resinous secretions which yield their perfume only when warmed by the hand holding them" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 153). The erotics of this text takes two; the reader's warm touch is necessary to the release of Gide's "secreted" meanings, making one an enabling partner on this intimate journey.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup></p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>How does this particular literary and visual geography of queer modernism transform our understandings of Orientalism and its others? These pages have focused on two venues by which early twentieth-century artists harnessed literary genres and traditions associated with the Middle East to impart often innovative and, for their times, sexually explicit visions of same-sex desire. One venue, embraced by Gide, involves rethinking travel narrative through a modernist lens, in which understated impressionism and lyricism summon up a more visually tactile image of foreignness than does exacting realism's attempt to create "word pictures" through exhaustive detail. The second venue, practiced by the unknown author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, Aleister Crowley, and Jacob Israel De Haan, involves borrowing from Persian, Ottoman, and Arabic literary traditions, freely improvising on poetic forms like the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal, şehrengiz</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> to convey a modernist <span style="font-style:italic;">ars homoerotica</span>. These latter genre revisions share in common the topos of the beautiful youth, at once a staple in traditional Middle-East literature <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a marker of Orientalist projections and western desires that sometimes remain blind to their colonializing propensities. This potential to appropriate the other as material for Orientalist fantasy is most obvious in turn-of-the-twentieth-century ethnopornography and erotic photography. The latter's visual catalogues of "nearly" middle eastern boys call to mind, in turn, another trait shared by the genres of travelogue and erotic poetry <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  traced above: the stringing together in serial form of scenarios and/or objects of desire that, like photographs pasted in an album, become mementos of the elusive attempt to fix desire, to remember fleeting moments that have already passed, moments whose framing will always suggest the inadequacy of the effort to bridge otherness.</p>
<p>I don't want to end by giving the impression that the literary borrowings and improvisations of these queerly-inclined modernist artists are simply the esoteric byproducts of a relatively minor offshoot of modernism, to be shelved with other oddities of early twentieth-century literature—although these texts are also just that, "wayside" pieces that exist outside the mainstream. "Minor" as these works individually may be, they participate in a larger phenomenon of Orientalist homoerotics in which issues of visibility and visuality continue to set off minefields in the cultural politics of East and West. Exemplary in this light is a recently unearthed archive of photographs that uncannily recall—with a major difference—the visual <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> produced 100 years before by purveyors of erotic postcards in the Middle East. Published in the volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Taliban</span>, these pensive photographs of young soldiers posing singly and in pairs were found by Thomas Dworzak in a closed-down studio in Kandahar shortly after the Taliban fled the city in 2002.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> The eerie continuity and discontinuity between images such as Lehnert's photograph of two boys arm-in-arm and these Taliban youth (<a name="2-text" href="#2">. 32 &amp; 33</a>) exists not only in the subject matter, but in photographic technique, particularly the use of hand-tinted coloration and blatant props.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> It is a commonplace that the</p>

<p class="continued">Taliban's young recruits came from the countryside where, despite Taliban condemnation of homosexuality, the tradition of male sexual apprenticeships and relationships was still widely practiced, as Ahmed Rachid notes.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> This historical reality so suffuses these photographs with a palpable if unworldly homoeroticism (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 34</a>) that Dworzak was accused by the Left of demeaning and "othering" these resistance ters by taking these pictures himself (and passing them off as "originals") and then colorizing them in the style of gay artists Gilbert and George in order to turn them into camp aesthetic commodities. But, as Dworzak attests, these "found objects" are exactly that, photographs whose contradictory valences—artillery, narcissism, intimacy—tell stories worth sharing.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> So intent on seeing a narrative of western appropriation, Dworzak's critics failed to see these images for what they are, and in doing so, revealed not only their own latent homophobia but, once again, how easily homosexuality can be used as a political weapon to reinstate a reductive "West-versus-Middle-East" binary. Seeing these images "as they are" does not mean their new viewers will ever know with certainty the precise nature of the desires inspiring these photographs or the relationships they recorded. But it does mean that viewers can open themselves to the "contradictory cultural context of these oddly beautiful photographs," acknowledging the sheer "risk layered into these shots, and the triumph [over risk, over prohibition] they contain," as Jeff McMahonon puts it: "[these images reveal] an intimacy we have trouble interpreting; we know the frame but don't recognize these pictures. These are men who are comrades, and perhaps more. They are also soldiers of a horrifically repressive and puritanical regime. How can one pose with flowers, arm around your buddy, kohl highlighting beautiful young eyes, and yet be a foot soldier for those who would punish you severely for such an abomination?"<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup></p>

<p>If uncanny similarities of content and style link these images separated by 100 years, there are also equally resonant differences. Unlike Landrock's youthful models, paid to strike provocative poses to cater to a specialized European market, the subjects of the Kandahar photographs participate in a very different economy and erotics of circulation: they are not performing intimacy for some unknown other but for each other, nor are the images intended for public distribution or for profit. Shot furtively (since photographic studios had officially been banned by the Taliban), these images offer silent testimony to the fact that these recruits have chosen to defy their leaders' prohibition on representing the human face. Why? Perhaps out of the desire to memorialize themselves, if only for a frozen instant, before embracing martyrdom and death. Perhaps out of the desire to honor bonds whose actual nature can only be guessed at, but whose intimacy is achingly clear. For early twentieth-century gay writers like Crowley and Gide, Eros is celebrated precisely as a stay against, a deferral of, the inevitability of death; but here, in these twenty-first-century images, Eros readies to become Thanatos with each click of the camera's shutter.</p>

<p>Whatever one's thoughts about the ruthless brutality of the Taliban, the subjects in these photos convey an almost excruciating poignancy as, individually and in couples, they yield themselves to the gaze of the camera, preening in their best turbans and accenting their eyes with kohl, standing against incongruous backdrops of American ranch-style houses and Swiss chalets, holding plastic colored flowers along with their guns (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 35</a>). The homoerotic genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, reaching from sixteenth-century Middle Eastern poetry to the queer modernist revisions analyzed in these pages, is granted an ambivalent but haunting afterlife in this photographic archive—an afterlife that, staring one in the eye (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 36</a>), forces viewers to resist simplifying the complex, unstable, combustible relation of sexuality and the phenomenon we call Orientalism. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

Iraj Mirza's tongue-in-cheek vitriol is intriguingly complicated, as noted by Janet Afary, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Politics in Modern Iran</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), by the fact that the poet was himself a lover of male youth well-known for his homoerotic <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> before his political alliance with the Constitutionalist movement "converted" him to heterosexual advocacy (pp. 93-94). Afsaneh Njamabadi, <span style="font-style:italic;">Women with Moustaches and Men without Beards: Gender and Sexual Anxieties of Iranian Modernity</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), comments on the poem in her analysis of the excision of male homoerotic relations entailed by the birth of Iranian feminism .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>On the recent in-depth accounts of the history of same-sex relations between men in Persia and Iran, see especially Afary, Njamabadi, and, in a less thesis-driven vein, Willem Floor, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Social History of Sexual Relations in Iran</span> (Washington DC: Mage, 2008). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Although sodomy was criminalized in the Iranian Penal Code in 1925 (article 207), the law had little effect on daily life during the Pahlavi period. Immediately after the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, Floor reports that "hundreds of political opponents were executed on the grounds of having engaged in sodomy," and the new Penal Code instituted in the early 1990s included articles 108-126 defining the crime and punishment of sodomy in great detail. Ironically, a 1978 decree by the Ayatollah Khomeyni allowed for sex-change surgery, since it is not mentioned in the Koran, as a "remedy" to male homosexuals. See Floor, pp. 352-61; the chart in <a name="4-text" href="#4">re 4</a> appears on p. 360. The hanging in 2005 of the two youths depicted in <a name="3-text" href="#3">re 3</a> has been the source of considerable international protest, as well as ensuing controversy about whether the two minors were executed for consensual sex or for gang-raping a younger boy (the official version), as Jasbir K. Puar notes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times</span> (Durham: Duke University Press, 2007). While the demonization of Iran as a terrorist enclave obviously contributed to the international attention given this event, western concerns about patterns of increased homophobic violence need not always, or only, translate into "Islamophobia." State sanctioning of homophobic violence is not unique to Iran but part of a growing pattern across the Middle East. In addition to the Queen Boat prosecutions of men patronizing a "gay" nightclub in Cairo, Egypt, explained in note 5 below, see, on Saudi Arabia, "Islam's Loathing and Lust for Homosexuality" (19 October 2007), on the website www.islamicmonitor. org; on Iraq, "Hate Army Beats Gay Students" on the website of Iraqi LGBT, Molly Hennessy-Fiske's "Since Invasion, Gays in Iraq Lead Lives of Constant Fear (<span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span>, August 5, 2007), A6, and Liz Sly's "Gays Being Targeted and Killed in Iraq" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span>, August 18, 2009), A19. The journalist Brian Whittaker enumerates more incidents of government-condoned or sponsored homophobia in <span style="font-style:italic;">Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East</span> (London: Saki, 2006).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>The language of homosexuality as a foreign (western) vice was rife in the aftermath of the raid on the nightclub the Queen Boat in Cairo in 2001, during which over 50 men were arrested and accused of being homosexual perverts and Satanists. The headline in <span style="font-style:italic;">Al-Ahram al-Arabi</span> (August 25, 2001) declared, "Be a pervert, and Uncle Sam will approve," and <span style="font-style:italic;">Al-Masa'</span> (May 15, 2001) ran a story, "Confessions of the 'Satinists' in 10 Hours: We Imported the Perverse Ideas from a European Group," claiming the defendants bragged that they had "imported" their "perverse" sexual practices from European subversives.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>See Dan Coleman's speculation on the underlying reasons this particular comment by Ahmadinejad solicited so much mileage among humorists: "Of all the inane comments Ahmadinejad has made . . . it's interesting that the satirists have chosen to focus on this one. Denying the existence of gays in Iran is no more empirically absurd than denying the Holocaust. So why the emphasis on the sexuality comment? . . . <span style="font-style:italic;">[Is] it because sexuality offers an always convenient way to take a political enemy down a peg</span>?" (emphasis added). See Coleman, "Satirizing Ahmadinejad: the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> Picks Up Where <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night Live</span> Left Off" (October 8, 2007), on <a href="http://www.openculture.com" target="_blank">www.openculture.com</a>. The headline's mention of <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night Live</span> refers to a music video that aired on the show, "I-Ran From You," in which a male singer croons a song of unrequited love to Ahmadinejad that verges on xenophobic and homophobic stereotyping when the singer extols the President's "butter pecan thighs" and likens his sexual appeal to that of a "very hairy Jake Gyllenhaal" within which exists a feminine (read: homosexual) inner self we glimpse (via a cross-dressed look-alike) in a red evening dress draping himself over the grand piano while swooning to the vocalist's amorous pleas.</p></div>

Angelika Neuwirth, Michael Hess, Judith Pfeiffer, and Borte Sagaster (Wurzburg: Ergon Verlag, 2006), Thomas Bauerk notes that by the ninth and tenth centuries the beloved is "almost certainly a male youth," as distinct from traditional <span style="font-style:italic;">nasib</span> love poetry where the beloved is a girl. The Arabic <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> was typically 5-12 lines, with a specific rhyme scheme and the author's penname, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Takhallus</span>, embedded as word-play in the final line; the intent was less to create an original expression but evoke emotions that the audience would recognize and respond to through the manipulation and extension of a standard repertoire of images and situations.

The basic feature of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  (<span style="font-style:italic;">sharashub</span> in its Persian form) is its at once humorous and complimentary "representation of the beloved as a youthful artisan or member of another social group having such marked features as to allow a poet to make fanciful allusions to this quality" (Sharma, quoting De Bruijn [1983:7], p.142). Noting that the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> had been popular in the Ottoman world since the poet Meshi (d. 1513), Jan Schmidt, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Joys of Philology: Studies in Ottoman Literature, History, and Orientalism (1500-1923), Vol. 1: Poetry, Historiography, Biography, and Autobiography</span> (Istanbul: Isis Press, 2002), also points out that a central artistic amusement of such poetry was "the invention of puns on the names of the boys" being celebrated within the verse's metaphors and language, and that by the nineteenth-century, the format was "regularly suppressed by the Ottoman censor" for its homoerotic content (36, 38).</p></div>

In celebrating Von Gloeden's queerness, Barthes simultaneously participates in Orientalist fantasies of otherness, fetishizing Sicilian boys' dark, almost "black" skin, "dirty peasant" hands, and (supposedly) "swollen" foreskins. See Russell, p. 62, for an apt critique of this aspect of Barthes' essay.

In <a name="0-text" href="#0"> 21</a>, the way in which the youth looks to the side, rather than into the camera, connotes a daydreaming state of mind that suggests an autoerotic fantasy; in other images, the model stands in front of a dark, grilled exterior, suggesting the mysterious depths from which he has emerged as well as the shadowy recesses in which an amorous encounter may follow.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f58" href="#f58-text">58. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 16) The homoerotics with which Gide imbues North Africa is inseparable from the economic and colonial factors that made Algeria available to Gide. For a reading of the ambivalence in Gide's sexual/colonial politics, see Michael Lucey, <span style="font-style:italic;">Gide's Bent: Sexuality, Politics, Writing</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). Analyzing Gide's account of his euphoric, initiatory sexual experiences in Algeria in the autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">Si le grain ne muert</span>, Lucey shows how the purity and egalitarianism Gide attributes to these encounters depends on his repressing their colonial underpinnings; the youth with whom he has his first sexual experience, Ali, is his hired servant, Mohammed's "<span style="font-style:italic;">petit corps sauvage</span>" has been procured for Gide with Wilde's money. Certain of these less desirable reminders of the inequities built into the practice of "sexual tourism" are sidestepped, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>, the choice to homoeroticize sensation and environment rather than specific individuals or bodies; such re-framings forgo the occasion to analyze the socio-economic realities of colonialism, as Gide himself admits three decades later in a self-implicating statement where he confesses he was fully aware of the various social and economic inequities occasioned by colonial rule in the regions covered by <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> at the time he recorded his impressions, but decided issues like the "devious exportation of small Arab farmers" weren't his "cup of tea. I would have felt that as an artist it was beneath me to turn my pen to such vulgar concerns" (quoted in Lucey, 152). Jonathan Dollimore offers a short reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> as a pastoral narrative of loss and self-recovery that veils the extent to which privilege and power facilitate Gide's appropriation of Africa's "otherness" for his artistic emergence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 240-44. For more on sexual tourism and literary enclaves in the Mahgreb, see my "Vacation Cruises; or, The Homoerotics of Orientalism," <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 110 : 89-107.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f59" href="#f59-text">59. </a>Day's closeted homosexuality is assumed by art historians. See, for instance, Allen Ellenzwerg's chapter comparing the photographic work of Von Gloeden and Day in chapter 3 of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homoerotic Photograph: Male Images from Durieu/Delacroix to Mapplethorpe</span> (NY: Columbia University Press, 1992). The talented Giliberti, an openly gay artist of Tunisian heritage who lives in France, is also a novelist. His paintings are reproduced in <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyage Secret: Tunisie</span> (Paris: Bonobo, 2004). My interviews with Giliberti (Paris 2006) confirm his deliberate blending of the homoerotic and indigenous to form a counter-colonialist visual response to Orientalist stereotypes of the "other." Day's homoerotic fascination with Arabic subjects is also apparent in his photographs of the teenaged émigré, Kahlil Gibran, a protégé and the eventual author of the best-selling <span style="font-style:italic;">The Prophet</span> , whose prose-poetic imitations of Sufi poetry align him in interesting ways with "imitators" of the form like Burton and Crowley.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>Such suggestive but simultaneously elliptical wording is similar to the rhetorical device of the <span style="font-style:italic;">anacoluthon</span> that Roland Barthes locates in Loti's <span style="font-style:italic;">Aziyadé</span>, in which ideas are introduced but never finish and "drift away." See Pierre Loti: <span style="font-style:italic;">Aziyadé</span>,» in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le degré zéro de l'écriture suivi de nouveaux essais critiques</span> (Paris: Seuil, 1972), 170-87. Emily Apter also cites this concept in her analysis of Michel's use of incomplete phrases that trail off in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoralist</span>, in which what is left unsaid "<span style="font-style:italic;">pre</span>-res" the "unstated subtext of homoeroticism," in <span style="font-style:italic;">André Gide and the Codes of Homotextuality</span> (Stanford: Stanford French and Italian Studies, 1987), 113-15. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 106) Giliberti's evocatively titled painting, "L'entrée des contes" ("The threshold to stories"), reproduced as <a name="7-text" href="#7">re 31</a>, might be read as a counter-Orientalizing response by the very "other" that Gide is imagining behind that "black door"—but in Giliberti's version, this re has stepped out front to become a kind of watch-dog or guardian, and his direct gaze at the viewer both simultaneously challenges the Orientalist fantasy of entry and invites us to imagine the <span style="font-style:italic;">contes</span> that unfold to those permitted to enter.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f62" href="#f62-text">62. </a>The legacy of Gide's modernist innovations in travel narrative can be traced in the Moroccan journal Roland Barthes included in his posthumously published volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Incidents</span>, trans. Richard Howard (Berkeley: Universtiy of California Press, 1992). Like Gide, Barthes renders his impressions in a series of fragmented, brief, verbal "snapshots" meant to evoke as much as describe. But unlike Gide, Barthes interweaves these textual impressions with descriptions of the various Tangier youths who catch his eye. In this regard, his technique recalls the serial erotic catalogues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Livre des Beaux, The Perfumed Garden</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwaitrains</span>. In stark contrast to Gide's intensely affective engagement with North Africa, Barthes's narrative voice remains distant, coolly postmodern, as it reduces each boy to a few brushstrokes: each is fair game to be had in the vacation itinerary that traveling in Morocco offers Barthes. To grant these boys textual individuality would rob Barthes of the flaneur's <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> of exotic otherness, and himself of the colonialist's pleasure of enjoyment without guilt.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f64" href="#f64-text">64. </a>Sigel hypothesizes that in colonial postcards, the use of supplementary color or tints is meant to "accentuate the primitiveness of the scene . . . painted-on, primary colors suggest a primitive, uninhibited gaudiness" . While the idea is interesting, it may be an over-reading, since many turn-of-the-century photographs in America and elsewhere were tinted—some by the photographer, some at home—to "beautify" and "bring to life" the images. In the era of pre-color photography, and in situations where colorized photography is less affordable, tinting may have been a substitute that then became a style unto its own, not simply a "primitive" aesthetic. In the case of the tinted Lehnert and Landrock re pictured above, the colorization certainly adds to the sexualizing of the image by feminizing the boys, rouging their lips and cheeks.</p></div>

<p><a name="f65" href="#f65-text">65. </a>Anderson, in the section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Taliban</span> titled "After the Revolution," notes that "Afghans from other regions joke about the high incidence of pederasty among Kandahai men. They say that when the crows fly over Kandahar they clamp one wing over their bottom, just in case" (n.p.). Dworzak, writing of his experience of being routinely approached while on assignment in Afghanistan, writes that "If I had my balls grabbed by the soldiers (considered a neat chat-up line) in the north maybe once a week, in Kandahar it would happen daily. Soldiers there would tickle the palms of my hands; there were furtive caresses in crowds" ("In Downtown Kandahar," n. p.). In a <span style="font-style:italic;">Slate</span> online podcast on Dworzak's project, Ahmed Rachid comments, "There is a very strong homosexual tradition in which an older man will . . . adopt a young man and become lover, become student, and teach him whatever skills he may have." Ironically, Mullah Omar's Taliban movement really caught fire, according to Rachid, when he attacked and killed a local warlord who had kidnapped young boys he was forcing to serve as his concubines. Thence Omar emerged as a kind of Robin Hood re protecting the poor against oppressive warlords. One of first things Mullah Omar did was ban homosexuality, but given long-standing tradition, it continued, albeit very surreptitiously.

<p>Modernity, of course, has no single meaning, not even in one location. This polylogue—constructed collaboratively with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison—voices particular views shaped by different planetary positionalities.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Globally and locally, modernity appears infinitely expandable. Listening to these diverse voices, reading their scripts, I despair—especially for the new scholar just entering the field of dreams, a Tower of Babel with too many levels to climb; but also for the older scholar, trained in the old modernist studies: vertigo out on a limb, whirled up into a vortex of the new. Yet I also rejoice. Change is what drew me to modernism in the beginning. Why should it ossify? Why should the fluid freeze over, the undecidable become decided?</p>
<p>All that is solid melts into air.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> We know that. Why should we want a stability for the field that the modernists themselves rebelled against? Caught in the polylogue, we are in the thick of things. At the level of scholarship and teaching we inhabit what it is we study. As W. B. Yeats asks, "How can we know the dancer from the dance?"<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> We are participating in what we study, and we should not be apologetic about it. This is a planetary epistemology of modernity, of modernism.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The New Modernist Studies: Expansion and Containment</h1>
<p>In their 2008 overview of the "new" modernist studies in <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> Douglas Mao and Rebecca L. Walkowitz characterize the field's expansions along three major axes—the temporal, horizontal, and vertical, by which they mean the growing historical and geographical reach of modernist studies as well as the dissolution of divisions between high and low art and culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Jennifer Wicke has dubbed the field's making itself new a form of rebranding, a commodification of the field that ensures our own complicity in the logic of globalization.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Disciplining Modernism</span>, Pamela L. Caughie asks whether modernism can or should be contained and if so, what would be the ethics/politics of such "disciplining"?<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> We wonder, have the field's boundaries become so boundless as to incorporate everything and thus lose all definitional cogency or analytic utility? Does this rebranding exhibit imperial ambitions to colonize other fields? Or is this new planetary reach an unraveling of foundational hierarchies? Modernism, like modernity, exceeds definitional and disciplinary limitations. And yet, these terms require some set of meanings to provide any functional use. The conjunction of the need for limits and their failure to contain characterizes modernist studies today, recapitulating the logic of  itself. As Garry Leonard suggests,  is like the internal combustion engine: both exhibit an endlessly recurring dynamic of explosion and containment. The logic of modernity follows the hydraulics of pressure and explosive release; containment and then movement.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Beyond Anxiety and the Comfort Zone</h1>
<p>There is a palpable anxiety pervading modernist studies, according to Stephen Ross, a meta-critical angst about the nature of the field that manifests in uncanny attempts <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to define modernism and "make it new," thereby creating an ethically unjustifiable need for ourselves as a professorial elite.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> But a retreat into the comfort zone of a modernist studies based on late nineteenth-early twentieth century "high modernist" experimentation in Europe and the U.S., is neither desirable nor possible. The cat is already out of the bag. And yet, the danger of an expansionist modernism lapsing into meaninglessness or colonizing gestures is real.</p>
<p>To navigate between these extremes, I advocate a <span style="font-style:italic;">transformational</span> planetary epistemology rather than a merely expansionist or additive one, one that builds on the far-reaching implications of the linkage of modernism with modernity. This link, reflected in the title of the Modernist Studies Association's journal, <span style="font-style:italic;"></span>, might seem so obvious by now as to be unworthy of note. But it wasn't always so. In the early days of the field, modernism was understood primarily in formalist terms as a loose affiliation of movements coalescing around certain aesthetic rebellions, styles, and philosophical principles and resisting the aesthetics of immediate precursors in the arts and literature of so-called "high" culture.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Curiously, the substantive link between modernism and modernity appeared in Malcolm Bradbury and James McFarlane's introduction to their 1976 volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism</span>. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Modernism is the one art that responds to the scenario of our chaos. It is the art consequent on Heisenberg's 'Uncertainty principle', of the destruction of civilization and reason in the First World War, of the world changed and reinterrupted by Marx, Freud, and Darwin, of capitalism and constant industrial acceleration, of existential exposure to meaninglessness or absurdity.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In spite of their book's limited canon, the seed was sown for a radical departure from aestheticism as the definitional foundation for modernism.</p>
<p>Modernism, for many, became a reflection of and engagement with a wide spectrum of historical changes, including intensified and alienating urbanization; the cataclysms of world war and technological progress run amok; the rise and fall of European empires; changing gender, class, and race relations; and technological inventions that radically changed the nature of everyday life, work, mobility, and communication. Once modernity became the defining cause of aesthetic engagements with it, the door opened to thinking about the specific conditions of modernity for different genders, races, sexualities, nations, and so forth. Modernity became modernities, a pluralization that spawned a plurality of modernisms and the circulations among them.</p>
<p>To resist the definitional expansions in modernist studies is to t modernism's constitutive link with modernity. Could it be that the anxieties about the geohistorical and generic expansion of modernist studies represents an uncanny desire to re-establish a particular early twentieth-century Western aesthetic style as the <span style="font-style:italic;">sina qua non</span> of modernism? What is the ethics of that interminably repeated comfort zone? How are we to break the hold of the old modernist mold? That is the question, if we want to foster a planetary modernist studies. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Thirteen ways of looking at the interconnections of modernism slash modernity. The point of Wallace Stevens's iconic poem—like the point of Cubism—is epistemological: that seeing is multi-faceted; that what is seen must be seen from multiple points of view. Hold it up. Walk around it. Mull on its multiplicities. Listen to others who hold it up, walk around it, mull on its multiplicities. Resist fixity, finality, single perspectives.</p>

<p>Interrogate the slash! A planetary epistemology in modernist studies begins by looking at the meanings embedded in that slash between . The slash both connects and separates, it is the paradox of all borders. Many regularly assume that modernism mirrors, reflects, reacts, or responds to modernity—as if the historical condition of modernity precedes the aesthetic response to it, as if modernism comes belatedly as the avant-garde of dissolving epistemological and political hegemonies. I want to suggest however, a simultaneity of effects and practices. I think we should stop positing modernism as modernity's self-reflexive other, its symptomatic reaction formation, its oppositional consciousness.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest we regard modernism in its different geohistorical locations and periods as a powerful domain <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> a particular modernity, not something outside of it, caused by it, or responding belatedly to it. From this perspective, modernism is a force effecting change as much as it intersects other domains of change. Thus, I am suggesting that we treat modernism as the domain of creative expressivity <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> modernity's dynamic of rapid change, a domain that interacts with the other arenas of rupture such as technology, trade, migration, state formation, societal institutions, and so forth.</p>
<p>The slash between modernity/modernism implies a simultaneity, but also a distinction; a connection, but also a separation. Modernism is a part of modernity, a part that is centered in modernity's aesthetic dimension, which is distinct from other dimensions but not separate from them. Though interlocked with institutional or economic forces, for example, modernism's expressive domain is a product of particularly human agencies in the media of the creative, the aesthetic, and the representational. Focused on the contradictions of the slash, this approach opens doorways to seeing how the aesthetic interacts with other arenas of change. It also empowers a planetary approach to modernism that breaks the Anglo-European hold on the field. Every modernity has its distinctive modernism. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>I must confess, however, to some anxieties that I have not yet resolved. The power of those early concepts of modernism as the crisis of aesthetic representation, with a repudiation of nineteenth-century realism, remains very strong within me. It is one thing to claim, as I have, that texts like Tayeb Salih's <span style="font-style:italic;">Season of Migration to the North</span>  and Arundhati Roy's <span style="font-style:italic;">The God of Small Things</span>  are "modernist," defining a postcolonial modernism both interlocked with and yet distinct from Euro-American modernism.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The formalist experimentalism of these texts makes them philosophically, psychologically, and aesthetically attuned to writers like Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner, however different their modernities. It's another thing entirely for me to make such a claim about a novel like <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> , Monica Ali's predominantly realist novel of Bangladeshi migration to London. <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> deliberately echoes <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, embeds epistolary narratives from London and Bangladesh, and deals centrally with what migration scholar Nikos Papastergiadis calls "the restless trajectories of modernity," the dialogic and contrapuntal psychologies characterizing the "turbulence of migration."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> But is <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> a "modernist novel"?</p>
<p>I'm caught in a conundrum of my own making—my insistence on a planetary approach to modernism, alongside my anxiety at the implications of its scope. This is a confession. I find it hard to call a novel like <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> "modernist." But I think this is my problem, not the problem of the more capacious understanding of modernism as the expressive domain of modernity I proposed earlier. I think the struggles within the field are embedded in my psyche. The anxiety is there, but I'm not proud of it. It needs to be worked through, as a holdover from the past. That's what it means to leave the comfort zone.</p>

<p>A planetary epistemology of  must break the mold of Eurocentrism. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Eurocentrism</span>," writes Aamir Mufti, is "an <span style="font-style:italic;">epistemological problem</span>" ("Global Corporatism," 493). Epistemology signifies ways of knowing and embeds the political questions of who is doing the knowing, for whom knowledge is produced, how knowledge is deployed, and who benefits from that deployment. Eurocentrism, of course, is not the only centrism on earth—all societies construct narratives of their own centrality, exceptionalism, and world view through which others are viewed and against which they are measured. But in modernist studies, Eurocentrism is the dominant centrism to confront because the West's narrative of itself is the story of its own invention of modernity <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and because the field of modernist studies itself began in the West as a study of Western modernities and modernisms. A planetary modernist studies begins with "provincializing Europe," to invoke Dipesh Chakrabarty's resonant phrase.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Add to this an awareness that the concept of "the West" is itself deeply centric, repressing the heterogeneities and peripheries <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> Europe and North America and the degree to which the West has never been and is not "one." Eurocentric "structures of historical knowledge," as Mufti writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>normalize and <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> normative the idea of Europe as "the scene of the birth of the modern". . . . It is the social and cultural <span style="font-style:italic;">force</span> of this idea of Europe in intellectual life . . . that I am referring to here as Eurocentrism. . . . Humanistic culture is saturated with this informal developmentalism—a "first in the West, and then elsewhere" structure of global time. . . in which cultural objects from non-Western societies can be grasped only with reference to the categories of European cultural history, as pale or partial reflections of the latter, to be seen ultimately as coming late, lagging behind, and lacking originality.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The old mold of modernist studies narrates just such a tale of informal developmentalism—" we" did it first in the West (although the origin dates and locations differ radically, from Baudelaire to Imagism, from the Impressionists to the Cubists); and then "they" did it elsewhere: derivative and belated.</p>
<p>The power of the field's originary narratives of modernism is a wonder to behold.</p>

<p>How can we challenge those Eurocentric originary narratives, exploding radically out of their forces of containment, to invoke Leonard's combustion metaphor? The first step is to set aside the nominal definition of modernity as it has so commonly been constructed:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Modernity is: [fill in the blanks]</p>
<p>a.</p>
<p>b.</p>
<p>c.</p>
<p>d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Anthony Giddens, for example, a progressive doyen of sociological modernity studies, defines modernity as a specific historical development characterized by the rise of the nation-state, panoptic bureaucracies, and capitalism as developed in the West from the eighteenth century and spread to many parts of the world by the twentieth century. In his view, globalization is the diffusion of Western modernity to the rest of the world. He is not alone.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>A planetary epistemology of modernity, in contrast, needs to be relational, delineating not a nominal set of characteristics (e.g., "big" = x, y, and z), but rather defining <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  one thing in relation to another (e.g., "big" is not "small"). It focuses on the dynamics of change, the self-consciousness of change, or even the illusion of change—a "before" and "after," an "old" and a "new."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> As Bruno Latour writes, "Modernity comes in as many versions as there are thinkers or journalists, yet all its definitions point, in one way or another, to the passage of time. The adjective 'modern' designates a new regime, an acceleration, a rupture, a revolution in time." <sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> This relational, adjectival approach to modernity is more suited than a nominal definition to planetarity because it enables recognition of a spatial dimension to modernity's temporality, an interactional set of relations throughout the globe that may also manifest differently in particular places and times. It provides a comparative framework that balances the commensurable—what different modernities share—with the incommensurable—how they are different.</p>
<p>Of course, the relational dynamic of old and new is fraught with contradictions. Elsewhere, I have posited modernity's relational structure as a temporal narrative that invents the "before" as "tradition." Tradition is itself a construct of modernity, coming into being at the moment of its loss, a process both celebrated and lamented. In relational terms, Modernity contains within it a struggle—often a violent one—between modernizers and traditionalists—evident, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the U.S. and the Middle East today. It also contains a palimpsestic layering of new over old, one that often involves a misrecognition of powerful continuities that is constitutive of modernity. For some, such misrecognition involves a haunting of the old in the new, a return of the repressed occasioned by the ruthless forgetting of the past that Nietzsche and De Man theorized as constitutive of modernity.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For others, it represents illusory thinking based in what Bruno Latour describes as the needs of the moderns "to invent the Great Divide" between themselves and the premoderns."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In facing the question of how new is "the new," and how much must we forget to think of it as "the new," we also bump squarely into a major difficulty with the relational approach. Where the nominal definition provides the comfort of relative stability (modernity = a, b, and c), the relational approach opens us up to the difficult question of whether anything is "not modern," and thus whether any expressive form is "not modernist." Is there a historical period which is not undergoing rapid change across a spectrum of social indicators? Are there texts which are not engaged with that change? For any text that I might name, would someone rise up to defend its particular form of engagement with a particular modernity? Milton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost</span> for example? Willa Cather's <span style="font-style:italic;">O Pioneers!</span>? Norman Mailer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Naked and the Dead</span>? For <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity/ modernism</span> to have utility as analytic categories, even relationally defined, must we identify the <span style="font-style:italic;">not modern, not modernist</span>? <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>Although I still struggle with these questions, let me briefly share an experiment; an attempt to draw a verbal map of modernity relationally defined as a set of conditions—dare I say structures?—open to a vast array of distinctive articulations across the <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée</span> of history.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="sec-headB">Modernity as Matrix of Converging Changes</h2>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

<p>Striking, you might say, how much that map exhibits a modernist poetics drawn from the early twentieth century in the West. In fact, Satya P. Mohanty challenged my chart on just those grounds, saying that it represents an imposition of an aesthetic perspective onto modernity, instead of the philosophical one featuring individualism that he prefers, or the socioeconomic one Giddens delineates. He may be right.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Perhaps all relational definitions slide into the nominal, incorporating willy-nilly some presupposed characteristics. As I struggle with this problem, I acknowledge that I am what I study, formed by my background in literary studies—this is epistemologically true. I cut my critical teeth on manifesto modernism—perhaps my efforts to move outside of my epistemological frame end up repeating it. On the other hand, for the word <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span> to mean anything at all, we need to think about what is put into relation with what, and how that relationship takes on different forms at different geohistorical locations. Perhaps the modernist poetics of the early twentieth century in the West presciently articulated a logic at work in other times and places.</p>

<p>A relational epistemology allows us to see the globe afresh, to see that modernity which is not one, to see modernity in its multiple and diverse forms in the geohistory of the world. In step with the rapidly proliferating rhetorics of plural modernities, I ask, here, for an approach diametrically opposed to that of Fredric Jameson in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Singular Modernity</span>, in which he argues that "Everyone knows the formula by now. . . .you talk about 'alternative' or 'alternative' modernities. . . . But this is to overlook the other fundamental meaning of modernity which is that of a worldwide capitalism. . . . I believe that the only satisfactory semantic meaning of modernity lies in its association with capitalism."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such a reductionist view limits the nominalist definition, even more radically than Giddens does, to a set of one: capitalism. Jameson's notion of singularity impoverishes what needs to be a complex approach to the overdeterminations of history and the enmeshments of different systems of power in understanding modernity.</p>
<p>The profusion of terms for modernity's plural formations belies the singularity Jameson seeks. The field abounds in such adjectives for modernity or modernities as <span style="font-style:italic;">multiple, polycentric, early, at large, alternative, other, peripheral, divergent, discrepant, uneven, conjunctural</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">recurrent</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Each term is its own keyword, with different nuances, particularly in what it suggests about the relation to Western modernities. I like how they suggest a spatial approach to modernity, a necessity for globalizing a concept that has been predominantly temporal. I like how they assume an uneven temporality for the emergence of different modernities. Some arise at the same time, such as the modernities of colonizer and colonized in the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> of Britain, Egypt, and India. Some arise at different times, such as the early modernities of India in the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries or the postcolonial modernities of Africa after 1960. I like how the term <span style="font-style:italic;">polycentric</span> posits each modernity as its own center, with others as their peripheries. I also like how the terms <span style="font-style:italic;">uneven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">discrepant</span> invite analysis of unequal <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  power and privilege, both between differently located modernities and within a single location. I do object to the way such terms as <span style="font-style:italic;">alternative, other, peripheral</span>, and even <span style="font-style:italic;">divergent</span> reinstate Western modernity as the center, with all the "other" modernities as marginal or derivative. In sum, I like terms that suggest the fluidity and multiplicity of modernities, terms that refuse to use one modernity as the measure of all others.</p>
<p>I have been probing the potential of yet another term, <span style="font-style:italic;">recurrent</span> modernities, because it suggests that human history cycles unevenly through periods of relative stasis and then explosive kinesis; between retrenchment and expansion, continuity and change, consolidation and risk; between inward and outward mobilities.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The concept of recurrent modernities requires a capacious historical archive, the <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée</span> of world historians or what Wai Chi Dimock calls "deep time."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Different points of the globe flare up at different times as nodal points of transformational change across a wide spectrum of societal domains, each taking a particular form in its geohistorical location—from long ago world systems to today's globalization. As Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar writes, "<span style="font-style:italic;">everywhere, at every national/cultural site, modernity is not one but many, modernity is not new but old and familiar; modernity is incomplete and necessarily so.</span>"<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>

<p>"There is no modernity without coloniality," Walter D. Mignolo writes.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> He is speaking specifically of European and Latin American modernities formed constitutively through conquest since 1500. He regards them as distinctive modernities, but thoroughly enmeshed, formed through interaction with each other through conquest, or through colonial and postcolonial relations. "We have come to understand colonialism and conquest as the very condition of possibility for modernity and for aesthetic modernism," writes Andreas Huyssen of Euro-American modernism.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Have we all come to this understanding, I wonder, or do (post)colonial modernities and modernisms remain at the periphery of the field?</p>
<p>More fundamentally, do other, even earlier empires combine periods of violent conquest with rapid technological change, world-systems of trade and cultural exchange, the bang/clash of different peoples and their world views, and new representational practices in the arts and other expressive domains? Yes, I think they do. For starters, the Roman Empire; Tang Dynasty China; the Muslim Empire centered especially in the commercial and cultural capitals of Baghdad, Al-Andalus, and Timbuktu; the Mughal Empire in India; and the largest land empire in human history, the Mongol Empire—all encompassed these phenomena I am calling modernity <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> the modernities of the post-1500 world-system. All produced explosively creative mixtures of peoples and cultural practices.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Putting the formation of Western modernity within that <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée</span> does not diminish its global power, but it does change the exceptionalist, diffusionist, and hierarchical originary myths of modernity that have dominated the field. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Recognizing the violence and conquest that are so often a constitutive part of recurrent modernities helps prevent discourses of modernity's fluidity, multidirectionality, and reciprocal exchange from sliding into a utopian rhetoric of happy hybridity. To counter this tendency, I keep reminding myself that the massive ruptures of modernity across a spectrum of social formations are most likely to occur during periods of rapid, often brutal conquest that cause wide-scale material, psychological, spiritual, representational, and epistemological dislocation.</p>
<p>And yet, with the dislocations of imperial or hegemonic dominance come creative re-locations. With suffering also come the transformative agencies of the human imagination. Recurrent modernities, I believe, are neither pure defeat nor pure progress. They are geohistorical moments of dynamic kinesis that put in dialectic the dystopic with the utopic, slaveries with freedoms, destructions with creations. At the center of these contradictions lie the self-reflexive and representational domains of modernity, the arena of all modernisms.</p>
<p>Just think of jazz: Remember that Paul Gilroy argues that the first modern subjects of the Enlightenment period were the Africans torn from their homes, enslaved in the New World—alienated, exiled, transplanted, and infinitely creative.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> And in that new world, their descendants blended European and African musics to create creolized musical forms that have themselves transformed, traveled, and transplanted throughout the planet.</p>

<p>Polycentric, recurrent modernities and their modernisms develop not in isolation but always relationally through encounters with other societies and civilizations, encounters which are transcultural, not unidirectional. "Les contacts entre les cultures—," Édouard Glissant writes,—c'est là une de données de la modernité" / "Contact among cultures is one of the givens of modernity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 39/26). Historians of the global ecumene like André Gunder Frank trace large-scale patterns of encounter through commerce, war, technology, migrations of people, and cultural practices.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Anthropologists like James Clifford and Arjun Appardurai trace traveling cultures, intercultural networks, and the processes of cultural translation and transcultration, asserting that distinctive cultures form through hybridic interaction with others.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hybrid Muse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Transnational Poetics</span> Jahan Ramazani adapts these concepts of circulating cultures to propose a planetary poetics of modernism that is "both discretely located and thoroughly enmeshed, networked, cross-racialized."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> As Laura Doyle and Laura Winkiel argue in <span style="font-style:italic;">Geomodernisms</span>, thinking "in terms of interconnected modernisms" "breaks open" the term <span style="font-style:italic;">modernism</span> into something they call "geomoderisms," a landscape of interlocking engagements with "cultural and political discourses of global modernity."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In "Modernism, Geopolitics, Globalization," Melba Cuddy-Keane brings the "interactivity and interdependency" of "cultural globalization" to modernist studies, insisting on the multidirectional, kinetic, and impure fluidity of "disjunctive global <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  flows."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Reginia Gagnier's Global Circulation Project is a vast online dialogue among scholars around the world on the circulations of different Anglophone modernisms.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>The borderlands of contact zones create creolizations on all sides through patterns of imitation, adaptation, transculturation, and cultural translation. "I call creolization the meeting," Glissant writes, "the interference, shock, harmonies, and disharmonies between the cultures of the world, in the realized totality of the world" ("Unforeseeable Diversity," 290). Beyond <span style="font-style:italic;">creolization</span>, dozens of keywords in English are being used—and presumably in other languages—for these processes, each with different resonances, often suggesting both utopic and dystopic forms of intercultural encounter. Think, for example, of the opposing weight of terms like <span style="font-style:italic;">contamination</span> versus <span style="font-style:italic;">adaptation</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">theft</span> versus <span style="font-style:italic;">translation</span>. I have been collecting these keywords and sorting them into distinctive rhetorics based on the biological (e.g., adaptation, bastardization, contamination, grafting, rhizome, transplantation, etc.); the corporeal (e.g., incorporation, absorption, cannibalization, ingestion, etc.); the commercial (e.g., borrowing, commerce, exchange, lending, traffic, etc.); the political (e.g., accommodation, alliance, appropriation, collaboration, co-optation, etc.); the technological (e.g., interlocking, network, web, transmission, etc.); the cultural (e.g., assimilation, blending, encounter, hybridization, vernacularization, etc.); and the representational (e.g., mimesis, cutting and pasting, distortion, translation, versioning, etc.). In short, the vast array of keywords for interculturalism on a global scale point to the major domains that constellate different modernities.</p>
<p>Models of planetary cultural traffic, mimesis, and translation need to supplant older concepts of modernist internationalism, which are typically based on binaries of Self-Other, modern-traditional, civilized-savage, high art-primitive art. The appropriation model in particular regards the modernists of the West as cosmopolitan producers of culture who cite or steal the traditions of the Rest to break out of the repressive, clichéd, or narrow representational conventions of the West. Whether used in praise or critique of the West's modernism, the appropriation model recapitulates the logic of imperialism, with the Rest providing the raw material transmuted into modernist art in the West. As Jahan Ramazani argues, "Criticism that reduces high modernist . . . 'appropriations' to orientalist theft or primitivist exoticism may risk circumscribing instead of opening up possibilities for global and transnational analysis." <sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Demoiselles D'Avignon</span> , with its incorporation of African masks into three of the five faces of the prostitutes in the painting, is often invoked as the iconic example of this appropriation model.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>] As Simon Gikandi has argued, such discussions often refuse to grant African art the position of aesthetic or formal innovation, instead reducing it to the fetishistic and psychological.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In contrast to the appropriation model, a planetary approach to cultural circulation would stress how the agencies of African artists producing and being collected in Africa in the late nineteenth century were part of a colonial modernity, constituting a colonial modernism that Picasso and the cubists indigenized, that is, made native to Parisian modernism. The creative agencies of modernities outside the West circulated into the West as transformative influences. Who, we must ask, is derivative of whom?

<p>A planetary aesthetics of modernism needs to be transformative rather than merely additive. It is worthwhile to identify texts—visual, verbal, auditory—outside the West that exhibit the aesthetics of so-called "high modernism," but a fully planetary approach should aim to detect the different forms that representational rupture take in connection with different modernities. We need to let go of the familiar laundry list of aesthetic properties drawn from the Western culture capitals of the early twentieth century as <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> definitional core of modernism. I'm attached to that list, as I have confessed. But we need to provincialize it, that is to see "high" or "avant-garde" modernism as ONE articulation of a particularly situated modernism—an important modernism but not the measure by which all others are judged and to which all others must be compared. Instead, we must look across the planet, through deep time, and vertically within each location to identify sites of the slash—modernity/modernism—and then focus our attention on the nature of the particular modernity in question, explore the shapes and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  forms of creative expressivities engaging that modernity, and ask what cultural and political work those aesthetic practices perform as an important domain within it.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not suggesting we abandon consideration of the aesthetic, the formal, particularly the creative agencies of expressive culture that put into question the representational conventions of their time and place. I want to avoid the familiar polarization of aesthetics and politics that privileges one over the other. Rather, I hope that we can be open to different kinds of aesthetic innovation linked to different modernities around the world and through time. In this regard, the aesthetic is always imbricated in the political, the historical. And <span style="font-style:italic;">vice versa</span>. Not a single set of formalist characteristics, but rather the formal <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, however it might articulate the modern.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the experimental blend of high and low culture as aesthetic markers of an African diasporic modernity in the Harlem Renaissance. Langston Hughes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Montage of a Dream Deferred</span> weds a jazz and blues aesthetic to the lyric sequence form of the twentieth-century long poem and the dialectical principles of cinematic montage:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>      Dream Boogie<br>Good morning, daddy!<br>Ain't you heard<br>The boogie-woogie rumble<br>Of a dream deferred?</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Listen closely:</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>. . . . . . . . . . . .<br><span style="font-style:italic;">You think</span><br><span style="font-style:italic;">It's a happy beat?</span></p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>. . . . . . . . . . . .<br>Sure,<br>I'm happy!<br>Take it away</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>      Hey, pop!<br>      Re-bop!<br>      Mop!</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>      Y-e-a-h!<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Take the particular intertextuality of postcolonial modernisms. The global citational strategies of Pound and Eliot are reinvented in the dialogic engagement of the colonized with the colonizer, through denaturalizing mimicries or indigenizing transplantions, as in Tayeb Salih's or Arundhati Roy's rewriting of <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>. Roy's play with Conrad's title—"Dark of Heartness tiptoed into the Heart of Darkness"—does more than mimic in a colonial register. It relocates the "darkness" of all states (colonizing, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  colonized, and postcolonial) from the purely geopolitical to the interpenetrations of public and private, institutional and personal, thereby fostering a rereading of Marlow's lie to the Intended.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Postcolonial intertextualities are not derivative; they innovate, in a different register, breaking with other and often multiple conventions.</p>
<p>A planetary modernist poetics must be plural, opening up the concept of formal ruptures to a wide array of representational engagements with modernity. "Rather than privilege the radically new in Western avant-gardist fashion," writes Huyssen, "we may want to focus on the complexity of repetition and rewriting, <span style="font-style:italic;">bricolage</span> and translation," or the layering of high and low, realism and experiment, " thus expanding our notion of innovation."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In Latin America, Mary Louise Pratt argues, European avant-gardism developed alongside other experimentalisms with rural, frontier, and ethnographic aesthetics blending orality, popular forms, realism, the vernacular, and the supernatural—as in the modernist magic realism of Gabriel García Márquez.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>

<p>How can modernist studies be planetary if it is monolingual, if it operates within the <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> of any given era, if it reproduces the linguistic hegemonies of modernity's imperial legacies, if, for example, it remains within the confines of global English today?</p>
<p>"Le dit de la Relation," Glissant writes, "est multilingue. Par-delà les impositions des puissances économiques et des pressions culturelles, ils s'oppose en droit au totalitanisme des visées, monolingues" / "Relation is spoken multilingually. Going beyond the impositions of economic forces and cultural pressures, Relation rightfully opposes totalitarianism of any monolingual intent" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 31/19). Even more than multilingualism, however, Glissant advocates a "worldness" in which "we write . . . in the presence of all the world's languages, all of them, leaving none out of consideration":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>If we say that we write, henceforth, in the presence of all the world's languages, . . . If we rediscover the fact that we can change through exchange with others, without losing ourselves. . . then we are able to glimpse what I would like to call worldness, which is our common condition today.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Unforeseeable Diversity," 287)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Modernity's polylogue is a vast archive of hundreds of languages beyond the ken of any individual. But Glissant's "worldness"—his concept of "planetary consciousness"—asks not for the impossible linguistically, but rather for a transformative epistemology: that we write with the consciousness of the diversity of languages and cultures and the richness that these differences bring. In this sense, the multilingual archipelago of the Caribbean is his model for "worldness." Creolization, for Glissant, is not the synthesis or fusion of difference into a monolingual sameness, not a global homogenization. Instead, <span style="font-style:italic;">creolité</span> represents the principle of linguistic differences in mixture: the contact zones <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of encounter, linkages, interconnections—a poetics of multilingual relation based in the continual play of multiple vernaculars.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Translation has a central role to play in the multilingual globalization of modernist studies. Translation involves a paradox of the commensurable and incommensurable, as Emily Apter argues in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Translation Zone</span>. Equivalence from one language to another, one culture to another is not possible, but the existence of world systems for thousands of years has necessitated the continual presence of translation, evident in the ancient Rosetta Stone in Egyptian hieroglyphics, Egyptian Demotic, and Greek from 196 B.C.E. and the more recent Chengde Imperial Stele in Manchu, Tibetan, Chinese, and Mongol from the Qing Dynasty in the eighteenth century. [<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 13</a> and <a name="4-text" href="#4">14</a>] Planetary cultural circulations, networks, and enmeshments of the global and local all depend upon translation, broadly understood from the linguistic to the cultural. Indeed, linguistic translation is essentially a practice of intercultural encounter and border thinking, the basis upon which other cultural traffic depends. Translation is a form of adaptation, transplantation, indigenization—from one culture to another. The multidirectional traveling of modernities and their modernisms is fundamentally a translational practice.</p>
<p>On a planetary scale, the multitude of vernaculars coexists with the singularity of a <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span>, a common language that enables the cultural flows of the global ecumene—from Aramaic, Latin, Sanskrit, and Chinese to Arabic, French, and English. The coexistence is a dynamic and tense one, with the vernaculars perpetually under threat, with the native speakers of the common language privileged above all others.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Translation in planetary modernist studies today ought to be reciprocal and multidirectional. But it is too much of a one-way street, with the rest of the world translating English texts into other languages, with many fewer works being translated into English, and with English translation too often serving as the mediation between two other languages.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Challenging modernity's complicity with colonialism in the formation of a planetary modernist studies requires studying, reading, and empowering the vernaculars.</p>
<p>Every modernity plays out linguistically in a dialectic of the vernacular and the cosmopolitan. The linguistic cosmopolitanism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses, The Cantos</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> is famously citational, absorbing languages from elsewhere into English. Make no mistake, however. The opposition between vernacular and <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> or cosmopolitanism does not reproduce the binary of traditional/modern. The vernacular has often signaled a modernity of a different kind, a resistance to the hegemony of the language of elites of all kinds as part of widespread societal change.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Chaucer's Middle-English and Dante's Italian were harbingers of the Renaissance, breaking with the dominance of Latin. Women, at times denied access to the languages of "high literature," wrote and read in the vernacular, helping local spoken languages develop literary cultures: for example, Lady Murasaki in the early eleventh century, broke with the dominance of Chinese in high culture, by writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tale of Genji</span> in Japanese.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In medieval Al-Andalus, a new poetic form arose called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Muwashshahāt</span> counterpointing the parallel love laments of a man speaking in classical Arabic and a woman speaking in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the vernacular, as Maria Rosa Menocal shows.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> In fifteenth-century Orissa, a group of low-caste (sudra) poet-saints challenged the Sanskrit-educated elite in producing revolutionary poems in Oriya, the local vernacular, according to Satya P. Mohanty. One of these, Balaram Das, writes an explicitly feminist narrative in the vernacular that advocates gender and caste equality ("Alternative Modernities," 3-5). In his novella, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Broken Nest</span>, Rabindranath Tagore conflates the association of the vernacular with modernity and women writers by having a woman's anonymously published, fresh, modern writing in the vernacular take literary Calcutta by storm for its break with the artifice of convention-ridden Bengali poetics.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> The vernacular, as Amit Chaudhuri writes, is "the idiom of modernity."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>

<p>I see doubt in your faces; I feel doubt in my own. Ten ways of seeing that blackbird have produced an archive of modernisms that is staggering in its global and temporal reach. That way paralysis lies. What's a poor scholar to do? This is too much. That's just going too far. Don't we need to discipline the proliferation of modernisms and their interconnections? Can't we just globalize modernism within a single and identifiable historical period—let's say, 1890 through 1950, as the Modernist Studies Association's website proclaims, or 1840 through 1950, if we want to include the French? <span style="font-style:italic;">Genug</span>, enough already! <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Ah, that old comfort zone again, the return of what is so hard to repress in modernist studies. I suggest, however, that we return instead to the full significance of the slash: . If modernism is constitutively linked to modernity as the creative and expressive domain within it, then we are bound to recognize that particular modernisms take shape within different modernities and can potentially end up looking very different from each other. That slash has consequences.</p>

<p>To work within a planetary framework, no single scholar need do it all. Instead, we can recognize the foundational meaning of collaboration in the project of scholarship—we share a common project, however our views, methods, and languages differ. We can each locate ourselves in a manageable way among the multiplicity of critical practices in modernist studies. We can find our own place on the critical map of the field, one that suits our particular interests and knowledge base. As navigational guide, I suggest one or more of four main critical practices, each distinctive but also blendable: Re-vision; Recovery; Circulation; Collage.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Re-vision</span> is the act of looking again, of defamiliarizing the familiar archive by looking anew through different lenses, asking new questions of "high modernism": Picasso, Pound, Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, and so forth. What are the traces of other modernities within the texts of European and Anglo-America "high modernism"? Where are the footprints of the planetary in the local formations of the West? What is the ghost in the machine? Scores of scholars since Simon Gikandi's pathbreaking <span style="font-style:italic;">Maps of Englishness</span> have learned to read coloniality in the modernisms of Europe and the U.S. <sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> But the planetary not only incorporates Western empires but also exceeds them. The planetary of what Dimock calls "deep time"—a transcontinental spatiality as well as <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée—</span>needs to be reread in the modernisms of the West.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recovery</span> is the act of digging, an archaeology of new archives—other modernities outside the familiar Western ones and thus other forms of creative expressivities. New books on other modernisms are proliferating, working with modernisms contemporaneous with or in different time-frames from Western modernisms. In his translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kalapurnodaymau/ The Sound of the Kiss</span> from the Telegu of the sixteenth century, V. Narayana Rao, for example, claims an early modernism for Pingali Suranna, citing his invention of the novel-in-verse genre for Telegu literature, his radical disruption of literary conventions, and his psychologizing of the human mind. Rao also translates a more recent Indian modernism: <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanyasulkam/ Girls for Sale</span>, an 1892 Telegu play using parody, masquerade, and satire to attack both the colonial government and the gender system within Indian culture.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Multilingual scholars are the avant-garde of such recoveries, locating buried and forgotten texts in the global archive of languages, but scholars working in translation are also essential to bring knowledge of these modernisms into the <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> of the field.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Circulation</span> is the archive of mobility, calling for the act of seeing linkages, networks, conjunctures, creolizations, intertextualities, travels, and transplantations connecting modernisms from different parts of the planet. Often the pathways are the routes born of colonialism, passages to India, Africa, or the Caribbean by western writers like Forster or Conrad; passages to the colonizers' metropole by writers like Jean Rhys, Mulk Raj Anand, or Tayeb Salih. How is that relationality experienced, reflected upon, represented? What is the interplay of roots and routes in those circulations across the globe? Unlike a center/periphery model, circulation stresses the interactive and dynamic, assuming multiple agencies, centers, and conjunctures around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Collage</span> is the archive of radical juxtaposition, the scholar's act of paratactic cutting and pasting. It establishes a montage of differences where the putting side by side illuminates those differences at the same time that it spotlights commonalities. Ideally, collage is a non-hierarchical act of comparison, a joining that illuminates both commensurabilities and incommensurabilities. Take, for example, from different parts of the world and different decades, Aimé Césaire's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notebook for a Return to the Native Land</span> and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictée</span>. Voila! What comes into focus is a diasporic modernism based in the instabilities of colonial exile and the imaginative recreation of lost homes: for Césaire, Negritude reuniting the diasporas of slavery with black Africa; for Cha, the maternal body as route to a syncretic phenomenology of home and homeland. Both invoking the rhythm of <span style="font-style:italic;">aller/retour</span>.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Re-vision, Recovery, Circulation, and Collage: Four strategies for reading particular modernisms within a planetary epistemology. This is manageable. We can each find our place on the map without vertigo, paralysis. We don't need to try to do it all. We can change our epistemological framework and locate our specific method within it, as one part of a large, fluid, mobile project to which all of us are contributing, differently.

<p>Planetarity in its very name invokes the Earth in deep time. Does the planet have its own modernities, crises distinct from those of the human species? The critical practices of re-vision, recovery, circulation, and collage can examine the meanings of the non-human world for the human and the interactions of human modernities with the Earth as a planet in the cosmos. Can we, for example, re-vision Eliot's waste land in the context of ecological disasters and read the human mind as objective correlative of the landscape scarred by war? How do the rivers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness, Season of Migration to the North</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The God of Small Things</span> both shape and exceed the human stories upon them? "Time passes," Woolf famously writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, with human modernities a mere parenthesis within nature's geohistory.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more answerable is to examine the intersection of human modernities with the earth's non-human species, diversities, and cosmic rhythms. Ursula K. Heise <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  calls for an "'eco-cosmopolitanism', or environmental world citizenship" that frees the term cosmopolitanism from early twentieth-century modernist "connotations of social privilege and leisure travel."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Glissant's poetics of relation includes a call to recognize the "relational interdependence of all lands, of the whole Earth," and the particularly harsh consequences of the "politics of ecology" for the poor (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 146). He asks for an "aesthetics of the earth" which is not "anachronistic or naïve: reactionary or sterile," but rather an "aesthetics of rupture and connection," of "disruption and intrusion" that can encompass "the half-starved dust of Africas," "the mud of flooded Asias," "in epidemics, masked forms of exploitation, flies buzz-bombing the skeleton skins of children," "in city sewers" and so forth (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 150, 151). In what way do our human modernities Other the Earth, he wonders.</p>

<p>Planetarity as I use the term is an epistemology, not an ontology. On a human scale, the "worldness" the term invokes—to echo Glissant—means a polylogue of languages, cultures, viewpoints, and standpoints on . It requires attention to modes of local and translocal meaning-making and translation, to processes and practices of perception and expression on a global scale. It is not nominalist, fundamentalist: it doesn't name a singular , thereby privileging one over all others. It must, by its very "worldness," encompass multitudes on a global grid of relational networks. And that means encompassing contradictions, tensions, oppositions, and asymmetries. Like rooted and situated cosmopolitanisms, planetarity suggests a capacity to engage simultaneously with local and global modernities. It embraces the generative energies and synergies of modernism's Tower of Babel. In that, it is utopian. Not very quotidian, I know; not down and dirty in the trenches of reading, teaching, conferencing, publishing. But nonetheless planetarity is a vision that can percolate through the practices of everyday professional life.</p>
<p>Planetarity is not a threat, it is an opportunity. It means leaving the comfort zone for the contact zone.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>I use the term <span style="font-style:italic;">planetarity</span> in a different sense than Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in <span style="font-style:italic;">Death of a Discipline</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003), where she invokes "planetarity" as a utopian gesture of resistance against globalization as the geohistorical and economic domination of the Global South. Terms such as <span style="font-style:italic;">planet, planetary, globality, globalism, world, worldness, worlding</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">worldliness</span> abound in cultural theory without stable meanings; they are often utopic or dystopic, typically connoting a transnational consciousness or world system beyond the national paradigm, though seldom denying the continued significance of the nation-state. I use the term <span style="font-style:italic;">planetarity</span> in an epistemological sense to imply a consciousness of the earth as planet, not restricted to geopolitical formations and potentially encompassing the non-human as well as the human.

<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>In her great modernist polemic "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," Virginia Woolf constructed not only her "Georgian" canon but also her roster of "Edwardian" precursors entirely of male writers: "Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy I will call the Edwardians; Mr. Forster, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Strachey, Mr. Joyce, and Mr. Eliot I will call the Georgians."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Although some recent critics have written about the ironic as well as strategic nature of the Georgian list, modernist scholars still tend to take Woolf's word that available Edwardian models were male novelists.</p>
<p>Yet recent scholars of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> like Elaine Showalter, Ann Ardis, Talia Schaffer, Kathy Psomiades and Marysa DeMoor show us a critically-acclaimed and widely-read group of female and often feminist writers of the generation preceding Virginia Woolf's who produced novels that were aggressively "modern" in their attitudes and subject matter, if not in their relation to inherited narrative forms and styles.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Woolf read, and in some cases wrote, reviews of fiction by these women writers. Her relation to them, however, was at best ambivalent; her refusal to mention them in her major documents about the Edwardians protected them from her direct criticism, but in the same gesture implicated them in the judgment "that there was no English novelist living from whom" writers of her generation "could learn their business" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CB</span>, 99). Furthermore, by refusing to mention these female writers in her great canon-forming polemics, Woolf helped make them forgotten by much of twentieth-century literary history, or at best, regarded as minor. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The feminist writer of this group who is the most evident Edwardian antecedent of Virginia Woolf is the American-born London actress, actor-manager, suffrage spokeswoman and critically acclaimed novelist, Elizabeth Robins. Jane Marcus and Joanne E. Gates have written about Robins as a foremother of Woolf, a writer of the previous, maternal generation of fiction writers who shared Woolf's concern for women's rights and understanding of women writers. But both critics see the relation between Robins and Woolf as congenial and unproblematic.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Two reviews that Virginia Woolf wrote of Robins's books and several of her references to Robins in diaries and letters as well as some anecdotes in Leonard Woolf's memoirs indicate that, on the contrary, to Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Robins was outdated, "a prewar writer" who also put herself forward as a public re in ways that made the younger woman acutely uncomfortable.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Some of Robins's novels were also prime examples of what Woolf decried in "Mr. Bennett and Mr. Brown" as the characteristic incompleteness of Edwardian novels, provoking frustrated readers "to join a society, or, more desperately, to write a cheque" to finish them (<span style="font-style:italic;">CB</span>, 99). Yet Robins wrote about some of the same subjects that Virginia Woolf addressed only a few years later. Her anonymously published <span style="font-style:italic;">Ancilla's Share</span>, a denunciation of "sex-antagonism," made many of the points and used many of the images that appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>, published five years later.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Her 1905 scandal novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>, treated sympathetically, but with a very different attitude toward doctors, the themes of sexual trauma and the rest cure that appeared in Woolf's 1925 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>. And as this essay will discuss, a 1913 scandal novel, published in England as <span style="font-style:italic;">Where Are You Going To . . .?</span> and in the U.S. as <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, deals with the same questions about the education of young women and female sexual slavery as does Virginia Woolf's first novel <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, published in 1915. I use this original edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, based on the 1915 Duckworth publication, rather than the Harcourt edition, which reproduces the text that Virginia Woolf revised in 1919-20, because the Duckworth edition demonstrates that even in the first published version of her first novel Woolf was experimenting with a narrative strategy of withholding or presenting conflicting tonal cues, thus at key points refusing to give readers authorial guidance about how to evaluate events, comments or characters.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The clearly feminist themes are raised and complicated very differently in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> (I use the shorter U.S. title throughout) than in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>. In its own terms <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> is a brilliant novel, a gripping and persuasive horror story with a memorable message about female sexual slavery and female education.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> It has been overlooked until recently because modernist aesthetic values largely triumphed over those of late Victorian and Edwardian precursors. These modernist aesthetic values included repugnance for sentimentality and overt social and political engagement, and constructed late Victorian and Edwardian feminist polemical novels as a useful "other" to innovative early twentieth-century art and aesthetic theory. Scholars of modernism, however, can step back from the prohibitions that historically helped generate a new body of work—including the fiction of Virginia Woolf. This essay thus suggests another kind of antecedent for Woolf's modernism, and suggests further that we take seriously the tradition of the feminist polemical novel, which continued into the 1930s and arguably resumed with Second Wave feminist fiction in the 1970s. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The differences between Robins's and Woolf's novels illuminate, on one hand, the unexpected strengths of the sentimental tradition used by Robins to deal with provocatively "modern" subject matters in her polemical novel, and on the other hand, the counter-polemical tendency that complicates and qualifies ethical, political and aesthetic issues in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The earlier drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, initially titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, show how conscious and measured the process was whereby Woolf arrived at a different form—and consequently, I will argue, more radical thematic as well as stylistic possibilities—for her first novel.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> The stylistic difference in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> is most centrally a calculated complication or withholding of <span style="font-style:italic;">tonal cues</span>—evaluative markers signaling how readers are supposed to "take" key phrases and passages, scenes and characters.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Like <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister, The Voyage Out</span> raises urgent questions about the education and position in society of young women, female creativity and aspiration, the potential and dangers of heterosexual romance, and the most obvious model of the public woman, the prostitute. Further, Woolf's first novel aligns the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildungsroman</span> theme of being brought "out" with an entry into imperial and racial otherness.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Yet even in this early work, Woolf often refrains from presenting an attitude or pronouncement that can be recognized as authorially sanctioned.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Crucial scenes where readers are denied clear directions telling them what attitudes to assume toward an event, character, statement or description include Rachel's reaction to Richard Dalloway's kiss; the two dream sequences—the first following on that kiss, the second when Rachel is in the coma that leads to her death; the trip into the interior of Santa Marina; and the characterization of Evelyn Murgatroyd. Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> manuscripts present clearer values and often allow the third-person narrator to guide readers' attitudes, these drafts cannot be used to put political and ethical positions "back into" the published novel without a dubious theory that the drafts constitute a somehow truer, purer or uncensored form of the novel that Woolf finally submitted for publication.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Her revisions, like all those in her ensuing novels, tended toward greater sophistication and stylistic complexity as well as tonal ambiguity. To treat <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> as an archive of governing intention, a means of "clarifying" recommended attitudes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, is to disrespect Woolf's choices in the process of revision. This essay, on the contrary, sees these revisions, and especially the increased uncertainty in affect and value, as part of Woolf's modernist turn. The contrast with Robins's very different feminist project using many of the same themes points up how radical Woolf's techniques were from the beginning of her career as a fiction writer, at the same time that it emphasizes how these techniques involved presenting conflicting, unclear or simply absent tonal cues, so that readers are often uncertain about how they are supposed to feel and judge. The end result of such evasions is consonant with what Rebecca Walkowitz has called "critical heroism" and, wryly, "bad modernism." As Walkowitz explains, the purpose is ethical as well as aesthetic: "one must risk being bad—uncertain, inconsistent, and unsuccessful—in order to keep being good."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Problems of the Public Woman</h1>
<p>When in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, the young protagonist Rachel Vinrace becomes excited about a brave new world that has such people in it as Richard and Clarissa Dalloway, she consults the book on board her father's ship that promises to provide the most concrete information on the subject: <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who</span>. There she finds "biographies of bankers, writers, clergymen, sailors, surgeons, judges, professors, statesmen, editors, philanthropists, merchants, and actresses," only the last category apparently containing women, for the list continues, "what clubs they belonged to, where they lived, what games they played, and how many acres they owned" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 85). The incident sums up the situation of a 23-year-old upper-middle-class English girl in the first decade of the century who is realizing that there are other points of view than those of her immediate family. Although Rachel goes on from this passage to entertain a "vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else," she has also learned something about the social limits to her possibilities (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 86). The only women granted the distinction of a listing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who</span> are those ambivalent res actresses, who <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> they are professionally in the public eye are popularly associated with that most fearsome emblem of the public woman, the prostitute.</p>
<p>The prostitute was the shadow attending the newly public status of middle-class women. She was the woman "of the street," who incarnated a threat to the reputation, and even the body, of any female claiming the independence to step out on her own. As an actress and actor-manager whose immersion in Ibsen converted her into a highly effective public speaker for the suffrage cause,<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Elizabeth Robins was acutely aware of how indeterminate both professions could be in public discourse—and of the connotations of "profession" in any reference to women. As she noted, "[t]o say 'a public woman' is, or was recently to say a woman of the streets."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> In her great suffrage novel of 1907, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Convert</span>, she played on the ambiguity by making the suffrage activism of its protagonist a consequence of prior sexual vulnerability. Vida Levering becomes a public polemicist for the movement in part because she earlier had a sexual relationship with a man who coerced her to get an abortion when a child was unsuitable to his political future. Her "fall" motivates her to enter public life, not because she has no honor left to lose, but because her experience prompts her to question the standards of gentility giving chastity its value and isolating privileged women from their working-class counterparts. But in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Convert</span>, as in Robins's other overtly feminist works such as the 1908 short story "Under His Roof" and the provocative 1913 best-seller <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, educative sexual experience seems to preclude further heterosexual entanglements. In Robins's fiction, the move into the realm of politics and social organizing comes at the expense of traditional romance. The protagonist enters the public sphere instead of continuing a relationship with a man. Despite some gestures toward male feminism and the strategic value of women who are married to powerful men, Robins in her explicitly political fiction presented activism and leadership as clear alternatives to the kind of steamy sexual partnership she had portrayed in her 1905 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the character who chooses public life is the significantly unnamed narrator: the older sister, the counterweight to Bettina, who is the "little sister" of the title. The decision of this narrator to devote her life to medicine, or to public agitation against sexual slavery (or possibly to both: the terms of the final-page dénouement are vague) comes as a consequence of Bettina's kidnapping and disappearance into "one of the most infamous houses in Europe" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 258). The narrative of this older sister, who is "made of commoner clay" than the conventionally beautiful and accomplished Bettina, provides an implicit antidote to the disastrous story of an early twentieth-century doll, who is restricted not by an overbearing man, but by her own hyperbolically feminine mother to the infantilizing doll's house (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 36). The narrator recalls critically her own and Bettina's protective upbringing and spells out the logic that left them ignorant of men's sexual desire but wholly reliant on men's protection.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> on girls' education, however, the widespread public response to the novel focused entirely on Bettina's story and its lurid climax. In most reviews, the narrator dropped out of sight altogether. For example, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>' enthusiastic report, Robins had written "this heart-breaking story of the little sister, whom we accompany through her watched and exquisite childhood, her wildflower maidenhood, willful, a little spoiled, but utterly lovable, and whom we leave dancing and laughing on the edge of the ghastly abyss, into which she is so soon to be pushed."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> If this account seems blind to the way Bettina generally res only in the background of key events (because, the narrator explains, she is too delicate to take risks or responsibilities), it expresses a contemporary fascination with "white slavery" that mixed indignation with prurience. (The racially loaded designation "white slavery" does not appear in Robins's novel.) Robins initially conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> as a joint project with her friend W.T. Stead, the publisher of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and author of the famous 1885 article "Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," which first exposed to a mass audience the practice of child sexual slavery in the East End of London.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Because an abbreviated version of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> was first published in serial form in the U.S. magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">McClure's</span> in 1912, it reached an American public shortly after the Mann Act, criminalizing aspects of the traffic in women, was passed by Congress. Robins exploited the sensational nature of the topic and adopted a particularly extreme version of the style of sentimental fiction—by that point a genre associated almost entirely with mass-market writing. For these reasons, although she had structured her novel around a set of devastating dramatic ironies, her style and the context of her treatment in effect discouraged readers from looking for subtleties.</p>
<p>Yet the central irony of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> stands in direct opposition to a dominant ideological tenet of sentimental fiction: that there is an essential and redemptive feminine difference, usually embodied in female sexual purity. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span> Woolf remarked on "[t]hat profoundly interesting subject, the value that men set upon women's chastity and its effect upon their education."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Robins addressed that profoundly interesting subject directly, suggesting with characteristic irony that one effect of the value set upon women's chastity is an education fitting women only <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> prostitution. The training Bettina receives in the arts of pleasing prepares her beautifully <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  for a career in a brothel, where she is last seen singing a childhood song—full of suddenly apparent double entendres—to a circle of fascinated gentlemen. Throughout the course of the novel, neither she nor the narrator has any notion that prostitution exists, or even "that men desire women," to borrow a circumlocution from Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). After Bettina is absorbed by an international prostitution ring, the narrator realizes that many of the same police and eminent gentlemen to whom she turned for protection are involved in maintaining the brothels, and moreover are responsible for allowing the kidnappings by which procurers cater to a taste for young virgins. Using all the resources of a sentimental stylistics already in the process of being discredited, she emphasizes the implications in terms of gendered knowledge:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Eric, and all the rest (this it was that crushed hope out of my heart)—they all <span style="font-style:italic;">knew</span>. And they accepted this thing.</p>
<p>That was the thought that again and again tore me out of my bed, and brought the great Darkness.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 299)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The overriding theme of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> is that feminine innocence is sustained by a calculated withholding of exactly the information that might allow women to protect themselves.</p>
<p>In a subsequent essay, Robins wrote that she had deliberately set the story among the upper classes because readers would not take seriously a novel about forced prostitution if it involved a "common girl."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In a context suggesting that the only real violation consists in the fact that the missing Bettina has more influential friends than does the usual kidnappee, a London policeman voices this bias in the novel: "But usually it's poor girls" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 294). In <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, class is a crucial part of the prohibitions that bear on both sexuality and gender. The narrator broods over the way her widowed and mysteriously traumatized mother turns out a pregnant housemaid and refuses to shelter and feed a female migrant farm worker with her infant child, although this same mother cannot bear to hurt a spider.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> And when this narrator falls in love with a scientist and naively aspires not only to be with him but to be <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> him by studying to gain entrance to medical school, both the mother and the scientist himself find her ambition vulgar as well as unfeminine. Claims of gentility and purity combine to keep "respectable" women in the private sphere.</p>
<p>As Robins indicated, however, private and public cannot be separate in a society where successful marriages are a matter of packaging and value for money. A "discussion of supply and demand" initiated by an intrusive neighbor points up the similarities between prostitution and the licensed sexual servitude of marriage:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Lady Helmstone laid down the law that a girl's best "opportunities" came before she was twenty. In these days of Gaiety girls and American heiresses the whole question had grown incomparably more difficult. "Mothers with a sense of family duty—I may say of patriotism—have to think seriously about these things." She herself, having married off three daughters and two nieces, might be considered something of an expert.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 140-41) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The mother is furious at this mercantile approach on the part of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nouveaux riches</span>, but she is equally disdainful of her older daughter's incipient professionalism, preferring to provide for her children by offering only a more mystified version of a wife's relationship to her breadwinner: "'You will have husbands, I hope, to take care of you'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 44). The catastrophic conclusion makes Bettina the object lesson and the narrator the student who learns it. Apparently discarding her lover, who has proved capable of taking care of no one, she turns toward some unformulated ideal of public activism. In the novel's terms, the entrance of women into the public sphere is an unmitigated good.</p>
<p>The relation of young women to the public sphere is far more complicated in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, although Woolf's novel, too, considers the dangers of naivety, narrowness and prolonged childhood. For Rachel Vinrace, however, ignorance of the ways of the world and almost complete isolation from society have allowed her access to something else, something that Woolf signaled here—as later in "A Sketch of the Past"—with the word "reality":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling they felt, but that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not talk about, one could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people, without often troubling to think about it, except as something superficially strange.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 32)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The reality "dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not talk about" is not the same reality revealed in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the masculinist structure of society with its framework of unspoken class and imperial assumptions and Victorian conventions, including conventions about male sexuality and female economic survival. The major contrast in Woolf's novel is not between private and public spheres, but between, on the one hand, a world of commonplace and shared meanings and values that incorporates both private and public, and on the other hand, a world of essentially solitary, ontologically privileged experience.</p>
<p>From the opening pages, Rachel seems most at home in what is almost a parallel universe of unmediated contact with the real, where like a Heideggerian metaphysician she is "overcome with awe that things should exist at all."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Her suddenly defamiliarized apprehension of a tree, "which, although it did not grow across her path, stopped her as effectively as if the branches had struck her in the face," is one paradigm of an encounter with Heideggerian <span style="font-style:italic;">Sein</span>, Sartrean existence, the "Mere Being" celebrated in Stevens's poem, or, for that matter, the "reality" or "being" that in "A Sketch of the Past" presents Woolf herself with "shocks": "It was an ordinary tree, but to her it appeared so strange that it might have been the only tree in the world. . . .Having seen a sight that would last her for a lifetime, and for a lifetime would preserve that second, the tree once more sank into the ordinary ranks of trees."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Her gift for music is the sign of her aesthetic (and implicitly metaphysical) way of taking hold of things, a means that enables intense responses at the expense of conventional communication.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Yet these same intense responses inevitably bring her into <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  intimacy with the strange and fascinating population inhabiting her brave new world, "human beings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 143). Like the sheltered girls in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, she grows up to have experiences as a body with other bodies despite, or perhaps because of, her ignorance about sexuality and gender relations. In her case, too, these embodied experiences seem to lead to her destruction.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, sexual ignorance has equivocal connections with the central theme of silence—the subject for a novel that Terence Hewet proposes, involving "the things people don't say" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 238). Hewet's phrase has two distinct applications within the story. First, it designates the realm of reality that Rachel tenuously inhabits at the opening, a range of ineffable experience that by definition is distorted and constrained by the attempt to translate it into conventional modes of expression. Second, however, "the things people don't say" comprise the official codes of behavior and institutions that are unmentionable in polite society. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the most important of these is prostitution.</p>
<p>The specter of the prostitute haunts the tiny community of English tourists who comprise the fictional universe of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> An unspeakable woman ("I wouldn't like to say what <span style="font-style:italic;">she</span> is!" another character remarks [<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 123]) drifts through the life of the San Marina hotel residents. Not only unspeakable, she is speechless, and thus a fitting revenant of the things people don't say, passing between rooms in the night until she finally is "hoofed out," in St.-John Hirst's phrase—an instance of scapegoating that causes the more progressive and Bloomsbury-like of the characters to reflect on the Ibsenesque theme of the "monstrous, hypocritical smugness" of the English (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 342). To Helen Ambrose, St.-John Hirst and Terence Hewet, prostitution is a fact of life, a bourgeois masculine accommodation to the Victorian ideology of sexual repression. Implicit in their attitude is a desire to minimize this sort of fact and this sort of life: not to allow details like prostitution to affect the day-to-day functioning of educated, civilized people.</p>
<p>But as <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> has shown, the existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements. After reporting that Richard Dalloway kissed her, Rachel responds to Helen's information "that men desire women" (women's desire, a major focus of this novel, is never a subject of conversation) by demanding, "Tell me . . . what are those women in Piccadilly?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). The Piccadilly streetwalkers are the most visible prostitutes in the lives of officially respectable young London women, and serve for them as an outward manifestation of their worries about sexual impulses, gender subordination, class and the relation of sexual ownership sanctioned by the institution of marriage. Evelyn Murgatroyd, the novel's ambiguous example of a young woman who yearns to act in the public sphere, confides one of her projects to Rachel: "We ought to go into Piccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say: 'Now, look here, I'm no better than you are, and I don't pretend to be any better, but you're doing what you know to be beastly, and I won't have you doing beastly things, because we're all the same under our skins, and if you do a beastly thing it does matter to me'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 276). This speech suggests how a young woman, at the age when she is by definition concerned with her marriage prospects, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  regards her situation as in some inchoate way bound up with that of the prostitute. The link must remain inchoate because it threatens the whole distinction between the nubile girl and the woman for sale. Despite her social concerns, Evelyn does not venture to wonder <span style="font-style:italic;">why</span> somebody might do "a beastly thing." Both girls inhabit a universe in which marriage, although conventionally represented as the romantic choice of a life partner, is still the prime means of subsistence for women.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">What Girls Should Know</h1>
<p>The question of education in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> is not limited to whether young women should learn about male desire and alternate ways of earning a living, nor is a career presented as the alternative to the marriage market. Although written before British women got the vote and the right to enter the professions, Woolf's novel—in striking contrast to the narrator's yearnings in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>—in a sense assumes these advances as rights, if not yet achieved facts. Secondary characters like Evelyn Murgatroyd or Mary Datchet in <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>—women who are in some respects independent or aspire to independence—embody a reservation about what Evelyn calls "doing something" as the chief goal of female endeavor. The overriding concern Woolf had with the female artist, perhaps most tellingly articulated in her discussion of the woman of genius in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>, entailed prizing qualities that require shelter from public scrutiny: not only the solitude and independence implied in the demand for a room of one's own, but also a kind of anonymity or invisibility that informs the presentation of female characters in such novels as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> To Evelyn's accusation, "We don't <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> things. What do you <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span>?" Rachel answers "I play," a punning assertion Evelyn takes in only one sense: "That's about it! . . . We none of us do anything but play" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 275). After all, Bettina in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> played—and in fact played the piano—as part of her preparation for being kept as an upper-class wife. Rachel, however, "plays" as an artist. Her activity bears little resemblance to what the voices of English respectability regard as work. The Dalloways, for example, are comfortably censorious in their assumption that art is escape, or as Clarissa elaborates, "shutting oneself up in a little world of one's own, with pictures and music and everything beautiful, and then I go out into the streets and the first child I meet with its poor, hungry, dirty little face makes me turn round and say, 'No, I <span style="font-style:italic;">can't</span> shut myself up—'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 41). In many respects Rachel's "play" is the novel's most privileged activity—a point I will come back to a bit later.</p>
<p>But Rachel's "play" is also the activity most endangered by the process of bringing Rachel "out." The power of her own sexuality and the shock of learning about the importance of sexuality in the great world of "human beings" provide her with momentous experiences, which make clear that her sexual feelings, like the emotions aroused and assuaged by music, belong to the realm of the "real" to which the novel gives aesthetic and metaphysical priority. At the same time, they force on her an understanding of her availability and vulnerability. She responds to Richard Dalloway's kiss with a range of entirely physical reactions, to her uninterpretable, and presented in the text without <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  interpretation: "Rachel stood up and went. Her head was cold, her knees shaking and the physical pain of the emotion was so great that she could only keep herself moving above the great leaps of her heart. She leant upon the rail of the ship, and gradually ceased to feel, for a chill of body and mind crept over her" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 77). As her attention drifts away from her own sensations, however, she encounters an image of ease, acceptance and peace, and her feelings adjust to the mood suggested by the "little black and white sea-birds" who rise and fall "with smooth and graceful movements in the hollows of the waves" and seem "singularly detached and unconcerned." She addresses them, "You're peaceful." And her mood follows this identification: "She became peaceful too, at the same time possessed with a strange exultation. Life seemed to hold infinite possibilities she had never guessed at" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 77).</p>
<p>One of the great achievements of this description is that it tells a great deal about the incident without in social terms defining what has happened and thus without prescribing how readers should feel about and judge it. For example, it does not reveal whether Rachel likes or dislikes the kiss, is aroused or horrified by Richard Dalloway, is attracted to or repelled by men. The description of her dream that follows, with its motif of entrapment in a deathly vaginal tunnel and its gibbering "barbarian" men, establishes for her the threat posed by male, and perhaps also her own, sexual desire (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 78). But nothing in these accounts provides readers with unmistakable clues about Rachel's sexual preferences or attitudes, or even responses to this particular incident. This passage withholds tonal cues from readers in the same gesture as it represents Rachel not knowing herself how she feels.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> She wanders among the possibilities encoded in ready-made expressions, telling Helen "I like him," "I became terrified" and "I shall think about it all day and all night until I find out exactly what it does mean."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> The fluctuations and intensity disturb Helen, who counsels, "The pity is to get things out of proportion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). But for Rachel, as later for Septimus Smith in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, proportion may signal assimilation into socially restricted, "normal" classifications of thought and feeling. Rachel's nonverbal and nonrepresentational art seems to draw her away from restraints and norms. She runs to extremes. Rachel's gender, on the other hand, constitutes within the world of the novel an overriding social reason that she should submit to social molding.</p>
<p>In direct opposition to the message about education for women in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, for Rachel, knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact. The ominous analogy of "the white, hairless, blind monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea, which would explode if you brought them to the surface" suggests that in being brought "out," Rachel moves fatally out of her element (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16). Instead of exploding, however, she appears to be compressed into lethal clarity, as the representational strategies of the narrative define her body more and more in terms of an observer's gaze. At the beginning of the story her physical appearance, from Helen's point of view, is vague and blurred, described as much through negations as through assertions: "Her face was weak rather than decided, saved from insipidity by the large enquiring eyes; denied beauty, now that she was sheltered indoors, by the lack of colour and definite outline" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 13). Three months into her stay in the South American town of Santa Marina, however, she has acquired more precise form: "a keen observer might have thought that the girl was more definite and self-confident in her manner than before" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 100). By the night of the dance she has modulated into a suitable heroine for a romance plot: Helen judges her "certainly more attractive than the generality of young women" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 174). And Terence recognizes his own attraction to her when he acknowledges that she has "a body with the angles and hollows of a young woman's body not yet developed, but in no way distorted, and thus interesting and even lovable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 227). Once she is in focus, Rachel manifests the physical qualities that fit her for heterosexual love and its concomitant institution, marriage. Or, more disturbingly, she manifests a <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> of the physical qualities that will <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>fit her for this generic requirement. Her body is "not yet developed" but, the narrator assures us (suggesting that Terence assures himself), "in no way distorted." Although the initial description of creatures lying at the bottom of the ocean associated her with the monstrous and perhaps also the marvelous, by the time of her engagement she has congealed into the right sort of shape.</p>
<p>The external description of Rachel's increased definition is only one of the strategies indicating that something supremely important is lost in the voyage that brings this young girl from the state of being an inchoate subject of experience to the state of being visibly and acceptably delineated. This peculiar process of social embodiment, in which Rachel acquires hard edges and discernible attractions in the eyes of her beholders, incarnates a more overt concern that Rachel herself voices about the inadequacy of cultural forms of representation. "Why don't people write about things they do feel?" she demands of Terence as he tries to mold her literary tastes (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 330). Her point, reiterated at key moments in the story, is that the established categories for containing and conveying reality are so irrelevant to her own impressions and sensations that they amount to lies. The implied parallel is that her own socialization into an appropriate appearance and role is also a lie—and a danger, because to become appropriate is to be appropriated.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Music and Reality</h1>
<p>The opposition between reality and conventional categories that Rachel embodies is identifiably modernist. The idea of a noumenal but (partially or tangentially) accessible realm different from the common-sense formulations and functional understanding of everyday life characterized the popular philosophical writings of Henri Bergson and the aesthetic formulations of Viktor Shklovsky, which helped define modernist literary aesthetics.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Woolf's middle-period experimental novels "of vision" and the treatment of "being" or "the real" in "A Sketch of the Past" assume this opposition (<span style="font-style:italic;">SP</span>, 70). When we first encounter Rachel thinking over the difference between words and music, she functions to some extent as the vehicle of Woolf's nascent modernist aesthetics. In her groping formulations, Rachel reflects that reality is apprehended by feelings, and that music, rather than language, gives apposite shape and expression to these feelings. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, Woolf made a non-literary art the re for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a reinvented version of narrative, in this instance a version gestured toward but not formally enacted, by the novel itself.</p>
<p>Unlike painting, music has a long tradition in the West as an inherently nonrepresentational form. Against the self-styled and culturally sanctioned literary (and Cambridge) men Terence Hewet and St.-John Hirst, Rachel stands for an art defined and judged by the internal coherence of its structure.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> In the imaginative process of representing a nonrepresentational mode of art, Woolf described Rachel's temporal performances on the piano in terms of designs in three-dimensional space, aligned with the abstract and artificial structures of architecture: "Now she stumbled; now she faltered and had to play the same bar twice over; but an invisible line seemed to string the notes together, from which rose a shape, a building" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 55). The analogy suggests an aesthetic form that invents rather than represents, and suggests further that this form is something to inhabit, if only for a brief period. In all these respects, Rachel's experiences of music have clear affinities with what Woolf would call in "A Sketch of the Past" moments of being.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>As the most evident prototype of modernist aesthetic sensibility in the novel, Rachel displays a detachment from the social realm that accompanies a frequently shocking readiness to make observations about its fundamental assumptions. She tries to get at what Hewet means when he refers to the sorts of question no one asks, by inquiring, "Whether we've ever been in love? . . . Is that the kind of question you mean?" until Helen tells her she is like "a puppy that brings one's underclothes down into the hall" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 154). In turning over in her mind Richard Dalloway's smug picture of a world wholly contained by the tenets of the Conservative Party, she considers unity and continuity not as high-minded abstractions, but as applied, with enormous effort, to the concrete elements of her own experience: "How if one went back far enough, everything perhaps was intelligible; everything was in common; for the mammoths who pastured in the fields of Richmond High Street had turned into paving stones and boxes full of ribbon, and her aunts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 67). Her naivety has the satiric effect of defamiliarizing ordinary situations, provoking wonder about what purposes they might serve and what realities they might veil. By the time she declares "I tell you, Helen, the world's bad. It's an agony, living, wanting—," she has established so much credibility that her tirade rips through the surface of the things people don't say with the force of prophecy (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 292). Perhaps the world <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> bad. Perhaps living and wanting <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> only agony, with no fulfillment possible. At the close of the novel, various characters consider and do their best to dismiss these possibilities in the wake of her death.</p>
<p>The aesthetic capacity that allows Rachel to gesture at the ineffable also brings the most acute feminist critical perspectives into the novel. Her defamiliarizing gaze is not always directed at ultimates and universals. On the contrary, it often has the force of cultural criticism, and never more so than when she is learning or revealing the unspoken rules of gender division. When Richard Dalloway declaims about the wealth of possibilities in "the age we live in" and concludes, "But what about yourself?" she says, "You see, I'm a woman"—a demystifying remark indicating that his talk of possibilities applies to an audience other than his present one, although Dalloway characteristically <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  recognizes the assertion of difference only as a provocative reminder of sexuality (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 76). Her conversations with Terence similarly dwell on difference: his own well-lit, much-discussed tradition and future as opposed to "this curious silent unrepresented life" led by women throughout the history that ignores them (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 234). Terence is feminist inasmuch as he is passionately curious about this life, especially as led by Rachel, but her attitude toward it disconcerts him, indicating as it does a way of existing so at odds with his own that he infers "she would never care for one person rather than another; she was evidently quite indifferent to him." What she says is</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"A girl is more lonely than a boy. No one cares in the least what she does. Nothing's expected of her. Unless one's very pretty people don't listen to what you say. . . . And that is what I like," she added energetically, as if the memory were very happy. "I like walking in Richmond Park and singing to myself and knowing it doesn't matter a damn to anybody. I like seeing things go on—as we saw you that night when you didn't see us—I love the freedom of it—it's like being the wind or the sea.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 236-7, Woolf's ellipses)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This speech shifts course abruptly when apparent pathos emerges as power. Without warning, Rachel suddenly displays the curious, silent, unrepresented life of women as a force undermining the priorities that Terence has accepted without question. Her maiden aunts, for example, strike her in the telling as "very real," and she describes them "building things up" so that "there's a sort of beauty in it. . . . so unconscious, so modest" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 235). Like Rezia Warren Smith or the retooled Clarissa in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, or like Mrs. Ramsay in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, these women make art out of their restricted domestic spaces and concerns; the restriction essential to the art, a defining element of its form and harmony.</p>
<p>Thus in praising unknown women, Rachel voices a part of Woolf's own complex feminist position, perhaps most clearly set out in the famous passage of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span> suggesting that Anon "was often a woman."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The arts historically practiced by women were a by-product of women's historical subordination, just as Rachel's aesthetic development follows from Rachel's mediocre and thoroughly typical at-home education, which "did not teach anything, but. . . put no obstacle in the way of any real talent that the pupil might chance to have," so that "Rachel, being musical, was allowed to learn nothing but music . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 29). This account of the undemanding curriculum designed for girls destined to be gentlewomen recalls the contrast set out in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> between the self-discipline and altruism characterizing the male scientist and the chagrin of the narrator at her own unfocused home schooling (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 78). The important difference, in many respects the most obvious index of Woolf's own modernist turn, is that in the case of Rachel the gendered absence of academic standards and demands has a complex value, positive as well as negative. The mediocrity of her education paradoxically fosters the aesthetic capacity that gives her a more intense and ontologically valuable reality of her own at the same time as it gives her a privileged viewpoint on the manners and mores defining the new world of social interactions in which she finds herself. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Social Killings</h1>
<p>Yet as in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the qualities of the feminine private sphere come into direct conflict with the power that installs and sustains them: not just male dominance, but in particular the dominance of masculine heterosexual desire. Such desire penetrates even into the ontologically privileged realm that Rachel sporadically occupies because it claims authority over how to interpret her experiences as a body. Especially because she is a woman and subject to exploitation, she cannot simply <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> these experiences. She must classify and define them in ways that make them normal, communicable and bearers of unambiguous value, even if such translations inevitably misrepresent what she feels.</p>
<p>When she describes to Terence "what it's like—to be a young woman," she lists the subjects that have come to preoccupy her: "Women one sees in the streets," "Men kissing one," "Things one guesses at" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 236). As in the aftermath of Richard Dalloway's kiss, it is impossible for readers to discern whether these experiences are "terrors and agonies" in themselves, or whether they terrify and agonize because they are unexpected and unknown, "[t]hings one guesses at" as a consequence of overwhelming ignorance. Once again, the suggestion is that Rachel herself does not know. Her relationship to Terence promises her an opportunity to find out. But this relationship, which begins with striking examples of how both are unable to comprehend their own desires, turns quickly into an appropriation—society's appropriation of both of them into its categories of romance and engagement and then as a corollary, Terence's appropriation of Rachel in accordance with the rules of romance and engagement.</p>
<p>What is touching and promising about the initial connection between the young man and woman is that it does not conform to established categories that either of them recognizes. Terence first acknowledges that he has singled out Rachel when he wonders, "Did love begin in that way, with the wish to go on talking?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 198). Rachel's feeling for Terence is nothing <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span> physical sensation, characteristically unverbalized: "When she thought of their relationship she saw rather than reasoned, representing her view of what Terence felt by a picture of him drawn across the room to stand by her side. . . . but what it meant she did not know" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 248). Against the familiar typology of romance presented by pictures on piano music, descriptions in popular literature and the dampening example of the newly engaged, thoroughly ordinary Arthur and Susan, these beginnings suggest the possibility of a wholly different kind of heterosexual bond based on conversation and companionship (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 197; 247; 148-9). Rachel holds on to this possibility even when Terence has lapsed into the comfortable sentimentality of regarding them as "in love." "No!" she cries, "I never fell in love, if falling in love is what people say it is, and it's the world that tells the lies and I tell the truth. Oh, what lies—what lies!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 326)</p>
<p>Despite her objections, once their bond acquires a name, Rachel is translated completely into the idiom of social relations. The engagement goes public during a startling moment in which she is abased and displaced: first struck to the ground and "[r]olled this way and that," and then presented with a view of the "great heads" of her aunt <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and her lover kissing in the air above her—as Laura Marcus suggests, a sort of primal scene in which she is pushed back into infancy while the alternative couple become her parents.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> As in so many of the important moments in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, psychological conflicts here becomes literalized in officially playful acts of physical dominance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>A hand dropped abrupt as iron on Rachel's shoulder; it might have been a bolt from heaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears. Through the waving stems she saw a re, large and shapeless against the sky. Helen was upon her.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 315)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The violence apparently disappears for Rachel when "she too realised Helen's soft body, the strong and hospitable arms," but as is often the case in Woolf's work, the maternal is also a menace. In particular, the sentence "Helen was upon her" anticipates the uneasy musings of another fragile and perceptive character, Septimus Warren Smith in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, who regards the threat to his freedom as coming from another ostensible caretaker, his doctor—"Holmes was on him"—and also from the vast conspiracy of what Rachel called human beings—"Human nature . . . was on him."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> At this point, individual caretakers and society <span style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span> loom over Rachel. As in the story of Septimus, their idols are ultimately proportion and conversion. Helen comments after Richard Dalloway kisses Rachel, "Men will want to kiss you, just as they'll want to marry you. The pity is to get things out of proportion. It's like noticing the noises people make when they eat, or men spitting: or, in short, any small thing that gets one one's nerves" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). The examples of purportedly similar things one should not get "out of proportion" are themselves hilariously disproportionate—and from a category of vulgar and obnoxious behavior, an odd way to locate a first kiss. Helen's attempts to teach Rachel "how to be a reasonable person" seem aimed at denying that an experience should, or even can be momentous (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 85). The process that I have called translating Rachel into the idiom of established social relations might by another metaphor be a conversion to a belief in a particular system of meanings for experiences.</p>
<p>The jarring event of Helen's appropriation follows a dreamlike idyll in the jungle in which both lovers feel they are under water. It inaugurates a series of events establishing Rachel as beached on the shoals of the marriage plot, although she ts valiantly to return to her element. At one key moment she and Terence again literalize the combat of their newly acquired gender roles by playfully ting "for mastery" over whether, as he contends, she will throw him "into the sea" or whether she herself will be "flung into the sea, to be washed hither and thither, and driven about the roots of the world," an idea she finds "incoherently delightful" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 331). When he prevails, throwing her to the floor, she cries, "I'm a mermaid! I can swim . . . so the game's up" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 331). It appears that although she might dry and harden, she can never drown.</p>
<p>But Terence has already begun trying to alter her miraculous and monstrous abilities, criticizing her art and undertaking to revise her aesthetic understanding by replacing the "antiquated problems [sic.] plays" she favors with "poetry, poetry, poetry!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 325). Ironically, his own opinions take on a resemblance to someone like Thorvald Helmer <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in that antiquated problem play <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span>, in that he begins to assume that any accomplishment she displays should be for his ultimate benefit.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Irritated by the late Beethoven sonata she is practicing, he complains, "I've no objection to nice simple tunes—indeed, I find them very helpful to my literary composition, but that kind of thing is merely like an unfortunate old dog going round on its hind legs in the rain" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 324). In the midst of scenes of puppyish tussling, this remark is oddly resonant. It looks forward to his assessment of the "curiosity and sensitiveness of perception" that she can bestow on him, an assessment, however, that is joined to an aesthetic appreciation of her naivety: "What would experience give her after all, except a kind of ridiculous formal balance, like that of a drilled dog in the street?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 333). It also summons into textual memory Samuel Johnson's famous remark about a woman's preaching being "like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Bringing Rachel "out" involves refashioning her into the sanctioned form of the helpmeet. In the process, it rules out her art.</p>
<p>Terence's discovery of what he loves in Rachel ironically foreshadows this development. In one of the most affecting moments of their eccentric courtship he arrives at a revelation: "'Oh, you're free!' he exclaimed, in exultation at the thought of her, "and I'd keep you free. We'd be free together" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 271). But <span style="font-style:italic;">keeping</span> someone else free is an oxymoron. The whole notion of keeping entails control. A keeper may not drill a dog to walk on its hind legs, but he makes sure the animals in his charge stay within bounds. More ominously, the scientist who desires to keep in specimen bottles the "monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea" may be intent on preservation, but what is preserved will not be alive (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16). In the case of the submarine creatures, in fact, they will never even reach the embalming stage. As Mr. Pepper earlier explained, they will explode if brought to the surface (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16).</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> sets up its catastrophe very carefully. This catastrophe is in its own way as lurid and shocking as the catastrophe of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. In both novels a young woman is annihilated, although in Robins's story it is unclear whether Bettina literally dies. In both novels, the annihilation is linked to a culturally-enforced denial of education and experience predicated on gender- and class-based definitions of the lady. But <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> refuses to provide the object lesson of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Robins's novel is clearly "Edwardian" in the sense Woolf described in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown": it leaves the reader with such a sense of "incompleteness and dissatisfaction" that "it seems necessary to do something—to join a society, or, more desperately, to write a cheque" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CD</span>, 99). Needless to say, the society and the cheque are responses Robins actively solicited. Like the gallant and pathetic Evelyn Murgatroyd in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, she urgently wanted to "do something," with the difference that she was well informed about what, exactly, should be done and how one might go about doing it. She constructed her novel with the intention of reevaluating the education given to women of all classes, as well as exposing forced child prostitution and gaining widespread support for legislation against it.</p>
<p>In contrast, and against Evelyn (and in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, Elizabeth Robins), Rachel is committed to "playing"—which is to say art and aesthetic experience, the stuff of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  what Woolf would later call vision. Her own entrance into the region of sexual desire has positive potential, signaled by the strength of her physical responses and her resistance to routinizing these responses into the banal formulations of social interaction. In this respect, her erotic awakening is like hearing or playing music, or perceiving suddenly the unanalyzable being of a tree. It is unlike aesthetic experience, however, in portending consequences in the public sphere. As in the case of Richard Dalloway's kiss, rather than being allowed to "think about it all day and all night until [she finds] out exactly what it does mean," Rachel must yield her sexuality to a public system of signification in which female desire ultimately translates into being kept or being conquered (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 81-2).</p>
<p>This tension between the experiences of sexual life and their social implications sets up the extraordinary account of Rachel's dying. Three motifs re-emerge with particular force in the part of the last chapters focalized through Rachel's consciousness—or more often, through Rachel's unconscious.</p>
<p>First, the metaphor of the underwater creature—mermaid or monster—returns to suggest that when Rachel falls into a coma she returns to the element from which she has been pulled. In a new version of the dream she had after Richard Dalloway kissed her, the oozing, dripping tunnel through which she passes is under the Thames, and eventually she escapes the requirement of attention to events outside herself and the pursuit of her "tormenters" by falling into "a deep pool of sticky water" where she lies, "not dead, but curled up at the bottom of the sea" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 368, 378). As she approaches death, however, she suffers the fate of the white hairless blind monsters taken as specimens and floats limply "to the surface of the dark, sticky pool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 385-6). Her return to consciousness signals to her doctor that she has little hope of survival.</p>
<p>Second, the menace that Rachel apprehends becomes in these chapters more feminine than masculine. Instead of "the little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering" of her first dream, there are "little deformed women sitting in archways playing cards" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 78, 368). When Terence later kisses her "she only [sees] an old woman slicing a man's head off with a knife" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 376). These images transform earlier psychic material, working not only on the dream of "barbarian men" but also on subsequent events of her life in Santa Marina. The deformed woman is most obviously the nurse who plays cards by her bed. During the church service in which she repudiated any religious belief, Rachel judged this woman "slavishly acquiescent" and engaged in "adoring something shallow and smug," qualities that in her mind come to epitomize the role of respectable women in British culture (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 253). The banality of the letters of congratulation she must answer—and does answer, finding herself using virtually the same formulaic phrases—intimates that with her engagement she has been swept into the world of female civility, in which women in myriad ways ease social interactions. Terence, the self-proclaimed writer of the couple, regards such compositions as her exclusive duty.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The hallucination of decapitation recalls the scene Rachel viewed from a hotel window of an old female servant cutting off the head of a chicken. The metamorphosis, and the image of the woman rather than the man as executor (and implicit castrator), suggest that she fears her own ferocity in the sex war that her social <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  experiences reveal to be the underside of heterosexual bonds. This image of aggression, like the dream of barbarian men harassing her, comes in response to a kiss. Still further, the multiple images of female violence suggest that her own sexual desires are a source of revulsion because they have betrayed her into the social world where she is pursued and tormented. And of course the old women, especially, suggest a second betrayal by the mother (the first betrayal was her mother's death), and perhaps also a betrayal by the primary object of her desire. Helen has been adept in turning Rachel's newly awakened affection toward heterosexual objects, including wildly inappropriate ones: at one point she solicits the socially maladroit, arguably homosexual St.-John Hirst to teach Rachel "the facts of life. . . . What really goes on, what people feel, although they generally try to hide it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 174). The terrifying or repellent res of women in Rachel's hallucinations signal a self-loathing and a mistrust of the maternal within the amniotic environment of the "sticky pool."</p>
<p>Third, the idea of chastity acquires new prominence. Rachel becomes ill when Terence is reading aloud to her from Milton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span>, a masque about the attempted violation of a Platonically inclined Lady. Moreover, Rachel acknowledges her headache at the point where the goddess Sabrina is invoked to "Listen and save!" the Lady whose virginity the pagan god has menaced.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Sabrina, the <span style="font-style:italic;">genius loci</span> of the Severn River and herself a virgin, is another version of salvation (perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> death) by water, as well as being a female and vaguely maternal refuge. When Rachel moves from <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> to coma, she thus brings together a group of ideas not only about male sexual conquest, but also about female suicide. And in this context chastity becomes an issue to Rachel herself, and many of her concerns begin to resemble those of Bettina and the narrator in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> Robins separated female eroticism from female achievement and service in the public sphere. Following through the logic that gradually emerges during the course of the story, Bettina's sister implicitly decides that autonomy and activism cannot be reconciled with the model of romance offered by her suitor. Her realization that love seems inevitably to entail dependency for the woman comes through a play on the idea of "need." As the two girls travel to London to stay with their ostensible aunt, the narrator confides to Bettina what she regards as a devastating truth about gender relations: "We don't only care more than men do . . . . We <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> men more than they need us" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 226). Her discovery is based on the observation that men's lives are full of interests and responsibilities, whereas women's lives are full of men. After Bettina's disappearance, however, the narrator revises her opinion to accommodate what seems a far more horrible truth. "So I had seen 'the need' wrong," she realizes. "The lamp of a young girl's hope, held up in her little world, to help her find a mate—that light was pale beside the red glare of this fierce demand from men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 298). In this account, female desire is not only weaker than, but also different in kind from male desire. The narrator's conclusion moves the fictional universe close to the tenets of the late nineteenth-century Social Purity movement, making the "red glare" of male sexual needs so strong as to be uncontrollable. Men "need" women more; thus they take and use them. The narrator's culminating burst <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of imagery to describe what she imagines has happened to her sister suggests how committed she has become to an anti-(hetero)sexuality, in which penetration is painful and so toxic as to cause death:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>When I was not delirious, the reason I lay still was sometimes half a nightmare reason; a feeling that the muffled night-sounds were like the bees at home in the rhododendron, drumming softly so long as we sat still. The moment we rose up, the bees rose too, with angry commotion, ready to fly in our faces and sting. Just so with that muted hum of London. If I were not very still, if I were to rise and venture out, all the stinging, angry noises would rise, too, and overwhelm me.</p>
<p>And out there in the heart of the swarm, Bettina. Being stung and stung, till feeling died.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 302-3)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachel does not "need" men in the sense the narrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> initially means. Terence both fears and admires the way she seems to depend far less on him than he does on her: in her "impersonality" as she plays piano, and in her apparent capacity to "cut herself adrift from him, and to pass away to unknown places where she had no need of him" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 323, 336). But in acquiring the status of fiancée, Rachel also moves into the realm where like the Lady in <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> she requires saving from his need—not, however, his sexual desire, but the desires that arise from his position in the social system, desires that seem ordained to violate the purity of her solitary, unverbalized experiences. In this way the notion of rape is finally articulated in the novel, not as the real issue cloaked by gendered euphemisms ("the lamp of a young girl's hope . . . to find a mate") but on the contrary, as a <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span> for the act of cooptation that threatens to disperse Rachel's aesthetic integrity into the various and banal duties and identities that attach to the dependent wife.</p>
<p>What Rachel needs is a body detached from social consequences and left in the realm of the purely physical. In an essay on Woolf's middle-period novels I called the representation of such protected corporeality the "visionary body."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, we see how the heterosexual romance plot puts the experiencing body of a young woman at enormous social risk. In this first novel only illness can give Rachel this purely physical body—through the irony of trumping social consequences by providing instead the alternative of dying. Visualizing the "glassy, cool, translucent wave" that <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> has presented as an escape for the beleaguered Lady, she finds "[s]he was completely cut off, and unable to communicate with the rest of the world, isolated alone with her body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 366). In a 1926 essay, "On Being Ill," Woolf treated illness as a privileged site of both physical experience and impenetrability. In this essay she identified illness as another ineffable experience, uncannily like the moments of being and sharing with the visionary a resistance to everyday language: the patient "is forced to coin words himself, and, taking his pain in one hand, and a lump of pure sound in the other . . . so to crush them together that a brand new word in the end drops out."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> On the overt level of plot, Rachel's illness is purely contingent, something picked up in the tropical climate and probably linked to the walk she and Terence took in the jungle, when they became engaged. In terms of the narrative logic, however, the disease is a consequence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of the move into sociality culminating in the engagement.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> It is the redemptive mode in which Rachel's inviolability and integrity are preserved. Its <span style="font-style:italic;">reductio ad absurdum</span> is death, which preserves these qualities forever.</p>
<p>Rachel's death thus raises the disturbing question of whether there is any role or adult position in life that Rachel could occupy within the social world without sacrificing her own identity and aesthetic capacities. The question may have pressed on Woolf herself, who, as she was beginning the book, wrote to a friend about her own attachment to a noumenal, ineffable realm: "My present feeling is that this vague and dream like world, without love, or heart, or passion, or sex, is the world I really care about, and find interesting. For, although they are dreams to you, and I cant express them at all adequately, these things are perfectly real to me."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> During the eight-year period she was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, she turned from her close relationships with women to experiments with several kinds of courtship and several kinds of men, married Leonard Woolf, and entered a period of mental illness in which she attempted suicide.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> draft shows that the emphasis on growing up and socialization as itself a tragedy came into the narrative quite late. In the earlier version Terence is far less overbearing and Rachel more receptive; the illness is not coded as redemptive; and Rachel remembers "that she ought to t something" even when she is dying.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> In the published version, on the contrary, "[s]he did not wish to remember; it troubled her when people tried to disturb her loneliness; she wished to be alone" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 385-86).</p>
<p>The conclusion—of Rachel and of the novel—is correspondingly more radical than the conclusion of Bettina in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Far from surrounding Bettina's disappearance with a haze of inevitability, Robins maintains in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> that the tragedy could and should have been prevented. In the process, of course, she enlarges male "need" into a conspiratorial force that finally seems to contaminate any act of heterosexual penetration, so that the viable alternative for women appears to be celibacy.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, however, it is difficult to see that Rachel has any alternatives to dying. While the last two chapters juxtapose the contingency and horror of her death with various characters' inadequate efforts to find reasons or purposes for it, there is a larger sense in which death is the necessary ending to her story. Rachel cannot become an adult and a wife without ceasing to be Rachel. Woolf's first novel implies the unsettling conclusion that for a young woman a "real" or "visionary" mode of being cannot survive social incarnation.</p>
<p>In a relatively early scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, Rachel chooses to read a "modern book" "such as Mrs. Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman's downfall upon the right shoulders, a purpose which was achieved, if the reader's discomfort were any proof of it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 131). This uncomfortable fiction might well be Elizabeth Robins's <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, a late example of the "incomplete" sort of work that irritates the reader into joining a society or writing a cheque. But <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> itself is about a woman's downfall. It does not distribute the guilt anywhere in particular, providing instead a range of complicated social, environmental and perhaps even developmental reasons—some clearly mutually exclusive—for the death of a young woman. Although it is the first novel in Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, and frequently termed "Victorian" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or "realist" in the relative traditionalism of its narrative technique, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> does not use its third-person narrator to articulate political (including feminist) <span style="font-style:italic;">positions</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">opinions</span>—although as numerous writers on Woolf have pointed out, all the novels have important political and especially feminist <span style="font-style:italic;">themes</span>. Rather, it produces effects of political and ethical questioning, qualification, revision, indecision and indeterminacy. The ambiguities of affect and judgment that I describe here became even more marked in Woolf's later novels, starting with <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> and taking especially extreme forms in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves, The Years</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>.</p>
<p>The ambiguities of feeling and value that Woolf created in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> show up vividly against the example of its near-contemporary <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Robins's novel not only directs readers' sympathies but obviously tries to arouse outrage at the masculinist exploitation of women in all the different classes of society. In contrast, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> seems in many ways to be <span style="font-style:italic;">about</span> tonal ambiguity: about not knowing how to feel, speak, act and interpret a world that in many respects seems to require learners to begin from scratch. Rachel thus embodies the reader, who has no explicit indication of how to "take" the dreams, Richard Dalloway's kiss, the scenes in the jungle and the village, and her final catastrophic illness. Her immediate, untranslated, and by implication untranslatable, experience prompts both wonder and criticism, evading ready-made categories that entail ready-made feelings and assessments.</p>
<p>But as I intimated at the beginning of this essay, the comparison between Robins's and Woolf's novels also has another and contrary effect. It reminds us why chroniclers of "a woman's downfall" might want to assign guilt, producing perhaps not only discomfort but also enlightenment and action. Seeing the tradition of the feminist polemical novel as one of her early influences allows us to indicate more precisely what Virginia Woolf turned away <span style="font-style:italic;">from</span> in her modernist turn. It also affirms that insofar as modernist innovation is a continuation as well as a reaction, Woolf's novels took on themes and criticisms pioneered by female writers of the maternal generation. Elizabeth Robins, both nemesis and progenitor of Virginia Woolf, provided subject matter and examples of audacity that Woolf could appropriate and complicate.</p>

Reviewing the novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>, the young Virginia Stephen wrote (revealingly), "It explains how you fall in love with your doctor, if you have a rest cure. She is a clever woman, if she weren't so brutal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Letters of Virginia Woolf</span>, ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann, 6 volumes [New York: Harvest, 1975-80] Vol. 1: 190). Robins, who had been a friend of Virginia's mother, became a neighbor in Sussex, and the Hogarth Press published one of her memoirs. At that time Virginia described her as "a great curse to me" with "her infinitely intense, exacting, persnickety demands" and reported later that "L[eonard] was riddled &amp; needled by Miss Robins for 2 hours (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span>, 5: 21, 5: 278).

"Most women" was a characteristically precise bit of wording. Other remarks in letters and diaries further suggest how irritating Virginia Woolf found Elizabeth Robins's "indescribably female charm."</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Farfan notes that Robins's performance style in defining roles as Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Hilda Wangel in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Master Builder</span> were avant-garde moments that transformed theatrical tradition while at the same time Robins made use of traditional melodramatic conventions combined with Victorian traditions of moralizing (11-33). As a theatrical performer too, then, Robins was paradoxically both traditional and modernist.

<p class="display">The Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen was one of the most important formative influences on the polemical feminist novel in Great Britain. Ibsen's particular modernity, as Martin Püchner observes, derived from challenging a tradition of stylized actions with a bleak, corrosive naturalism. (Introduction, <span style="font-style:italic;">Six Plays By Henrik Ibsen</span>, trans. William Archer [New York: Barnes and Noble Classics, 2003], xii-xiv). This turn in the European theater to what theorists of the novel would regard as a mode of realism led to a radical change in modes of dramaturgy and performance. Productions of Ibsen's plays in London and provincial theaters inspired national debates on feminist subjects like "Is Marriage a Failure?" (Mona Caird, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Westminster Review</span> 1888, cited in Elaine Showalter, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siécle</span> [Harmondworth: Penguin, 1991], 39). Furthermore, Ibsen's theatrical innovations inspired a generation of feminists to write not only polemical plays but also polemical novels with the Ibsenesque project of unmasking bourgeois hypocrisies about the roles and status of middle-class and sometimes also working-class women.</p><p class="display">One irony of this story of influence is that, as Farfan notes, Ibsen himself was no feminist, and in fact had little interest in any of the social movements that based arguments on characters and events <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in his plays . Yet not only feminists but also democratic socialists like Bernard Shaw saw in Ibsen's exposés of the bourgeois family and its role in hiding problems from blackmail to syphilis a call for fundamental social change. Among British intellectuals and activists, "Ibsenism" became a political philosophy (Bernard Shaw, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Quintessence of Ibsenism</span> [New York: Hill and Wang, 1966]).</p><p class="display">One reason Ibsen was so important for novel writing, at least in Great Britain, was that he brought previously private concerns into the public arena of the theater. While novels had during the course of the nineteenth century opened the private family house to the attention of a widespread readership, novel readers are by definition solitary, and the novel is historically centered more on individual agency than on collective conditions and actions. Ibsenesque political theater, however, combined naturalism with elements of melodrama to incite organization and collective action, using realist staging and performance to enact possibilities for intervening in the public sphere. The political novels inspired both by Ibsen's plays and by British plays taking Ibsen's work as models similarly combined empathic elements, notably features of the sentimental tradition, with a brutal naturalist representation of oppression and exploitation at all levels of society.</p></p></div>

Louise DeSalvo (New York: New York Public Library, 1982). DeSalvo notes that in a 1909 letter to her brother-in-law Clive Bell, Virginia Stephen defended what Bell had seen as her tendency to be "didactic, 'not to say priggish. . . . My boldness terrifies me'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, xxiii). That such "boldness" was transformed in subsequent revisions into something quite different, a multiplication of affective and evaluative possibilities, does not necessarily entail that this innovative narrative strategy was motivated by timidity.</p></div>

Interestingly, Farfan shows that Robins eventually criticized Ibsen for his lack of tonal cues, which she associated with feminist emphasis as well as other sorts of ethical and political evaluation: he was "not so much profound in his judgements of women as vivid in his powers of transferring materials for judgement to the mimic scene" ("Some Aspects of Henrik Ibsen," Lecture at the Philosophical Institute of Edinburgh, 1908 [Typescript Elizabeth Robins Papers, Fales Library, New York University], quoted in Farfan, 21).</p></div>

An interesting exception is Christine Froula's <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde: War, Civilization, Modernity</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), which treats the published drafts and the original published text of each work as though they constituted one large and varied text.

This essay acknowledges the many homoeroticisms of the novel, especially between Rachel and Helen, but finds the notion of any specified sexual identity problematic both because of the absence of clear tonal cues and because, as I go on to develop, such notions of identity constitute a narrowing and hardening antithetical to Rachel's creativity.

It takes one back to pre-historic times" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, 63). The voiced explanation is banal—perhaps necessarily so, given the way it limits the complexity of possible responses. Woolf decided very late in the long process of writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> to conjoin Rachel's feminist knowledge to an emphasis on the ineffability of Rachel's aesthetic and metaphysical insights. The latter emphasis, distinctively modernist, adds a radically new dimension to the story of a young girl's education and destruction.</p></div>

It was that slowness, that confidence, that content which she hated. . . . but the real things were surely the things that happened, the causes, the wars, the ideals, which happened in the great world outside, and went on independently of these women, turning so quietly and beautifully towards the men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 357). Evelyn voices an opinion congenial to Robins's novels, and in accord with certain parts of Woolf's own polemical essays. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, however, her position is compromised, in that the "real things" that Rachel understands are of a very different ontological order, residing in the noumenal rather than either public or private <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  worlds. The character of Evelyn is complicated and fascinating because she embodies in part values that Woolf endorsed in part. She is more like the earlier Rachel of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> drafts, who was significantly more self-possessed and critical than Rachel in The Voyage Out. Evelyn's desire to "do something" and her commitment to (inchoate) public activism are treated ironically—for example, usually aligned with Evelyn's forthright approaches to, and then boredom with, various suitors.

<p>This essay begins to untangle the complex and ignored erotic friendship and collaboration between Bryher and Marianne Moore, during the years 1920-1923. Until recently, as Wayne Koestenbaum explains in <span style="font-style:italic;">Double Talk</span>, critics have often disparaged and misread collaboration. He contrasts the Goncourt brothers' exceptional declaration that their work represented one self, one confession, one "I" with the conventional notion of the male genius working alone. Given that "male collaboration had already earned a reputation for perversity," the dual authorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, for instance, was initially concealed.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Even so, Koestenbaum explains, the poem unveils "an epoch we might call The Age of Inversion, when heterosexuality was in the process of being undermined and traduced by its eerie opposite."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The startling discovery that J.A. Symonds (spokesman for Decadent modernism), shortly before his death, had collaborated with Havelock Ellis on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Inversion</span>  is emblematic of how collaborative relationships, like the works they produced, were in themselves modernist experiments.</p>
<p>What of female collaborations in the "Age of Inversion"? While all collaborations are not based on friendships, the two are usually linked. Much work has been done to illuminate the networking and collaboration within female modernism.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Same-sex friendship, like collaboration, has remained a somewhat sacrosanct zone, set apart from romantic or erotic entanglements. In her fascinating study of negative or "backward" feelings in modernist queer writers, Heather Love writes: "The history of friendship is a particularly attractive archive for the exploration <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of same-sex relations, partly because of the relative absence of stigma, and partly because of the relatively unstructured nature of friendship as a mode of intimacy."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> More pertinently here, friendship apparently "holds out the promise of an autonomous space away from the tremors of eroticism, and also from eros's relentless narrative logic of pursuit, consummation, and exhaustion. Being with the friend is an end in itself. There is no orgasm of friendship; wedding bells do not ring for friends."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> It is against this "promise" of friendship that I propose a more muddied conflux of attraction and collaboration—one inspired by Love's emphasis upon "negative structures of feeling" and the call for an expanded queer literary historiography. My argument relies to a large extent upon a psychoanalytic model of transference, developed during modernism, which provides a necessary vocabulary for reframing collaboration. Transference, as a complex term of art, will be further defined and teased out later in this essay, but suffice it to say at the outset, that transference is part of all relationships, and can be differentiated from the conventional analytic situation, and newly enacted when unstated emotional currents and projective fantasies between individuals are routed through material, in this case literary, production.</p>
<p>As an illuminating case study, I examine Moore's erotic friendship, collaboration and transference with Bryher, born Annie Winifred Ellerman, illegitimate daughter of Sir John Ellerman, a shipping magnate, and the richest man in England upon his death in 1933. Bryher is an exemplary re through which to explore the question of "inverted collaboration" and transference, given her numerous material and psychic interactions with cohorts, friends, lovers, and analysts. However, Bryher is, to a much greater extent than Moore, recognized more for her <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> in modernist history than otherwise. For instance, Jayne Marek writes Bryher's "multifaceted support of publishing activities has been largely overlooked"<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup>; I would go further and say that virtually all Bryher's "activities" have been "largely overlooked." Bryher was decidedly not T.S. Eliot with his vague inklings toward inversion, as Koestenbaum portrays him in his "perverse" collaboration; rather, she repeatedly and unabashedly claimed she should have been a boy, and resisted her mother's attempt throughout her adolescence to mould her into a perfect miss. In February 1919, Bryher met sexologist Havelock Ellis, who confirmed "she was only a girl by accident."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Armed with the terminology of inversion and her new romance with the poet H.D. (born Hilda Doolittle, dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">H.D., Imagiste</span> by Pound), Bryher still could not embrace an openly lesbian or transgender life. Instead, she married twice for "convenience," and eventually adopted H.D.'s illegitimate child, Perdita, a scenario paradigmatic of the closet as well as of Bryher's radical meddling with the Edwardian family.</p>
<p>Bryher wrote the first critical book on Amy Lowell, fourteen novels, three memoirs, and two books of poetry. These books are to a great extent buried, and Bryher is known, if at all, for her roles as lover, companion, and caretaker of H.D., and secondarily as a patron of experimental modernists.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Yet Bryher not only monetarily and emotionally supported the creative endeavors of H.D. but also those of a host of other modernists in varying degrees, among the most notable—James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Norman Douglas, Edith Sitwell, Dorothy Richardson, Sylvia Beach, and Moore. Her wealth <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  enabled her to fund alternate artistic and political ventures as well as psychoanalysis; she used her home in Switzerland in the late thirties to smuggle over a hundred and five refugees fleeing Nazi Germany (many of them psychoanalysts). Her "accidental" gender, her own illegitimacy, and great wealth, among other factors, kept her giving endlessly, fuelling what I elsewhere refer to as "the melancholy of money," and what Moore called her "suicidal generosity," suggesting her need to compensate and substitute for an ongoing sense of loss.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> In essence, Bryher's literary and cultural reputation was thwarted by her overt expression of what Judith Halberstam has dubbed "female masculinity," or in Bryher's contemporary parlance, her inversion.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In fact, her intimate relationship to the bisexual H.D. for over forty years as well as her wealth, which established the reputation of dozens of others, did more to obscure Bryher than foreground her.</p>
<p>What has this to do with Moore specifically? There is no existing book-length biography of Bryher,<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> let alone consideration of her as a serious re within Moore's creative and affective universe, with notable exceptions being the respective biographic and archival work of Patricia Willis and Linda Leavell. Cristanne Miller, in addition, has opened up new perspectives on Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">in relation</span> to others, especially as a transnational re, linking her with Else Lasker-Schüler and Mina Loy.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Nevertheless, most critics underestimate Bryher's pivotal role in Moore's life, and common lore (in spite of Willis and Leavell) persists in branding Moore as asexual. In turn, the relationship between Bryher and Moore is often generalized as sanitized friendship without the "tremors of eroticism."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> While I have no pleasure thermometer by which to measure such tremors, my aim here is two-fold: to uncover through close reading and archival research a significant modernist collaboration, Bryher and Moore's; and to redefine female collaboration as having multi-dimensional creative, psychological, monetary, and ultimately, transferential aesthetic and erotic significance through the more ignored Bryher.</p>
<p>Driven by personal and passionate desires, Bryher's work often conred itself in triangular collaborations. For instance, through her ménage a trois with Kenneth Macpherson (her second husband of convenience) and H.D., Bryher spearheaded the first film journal in English <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> in 1927, which garnered translations of Sergei Eisenstein, contributions from Gertrude Stein, theoretical analysis by the psychoanalyst and founder of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Imago</span>, Hanns Sachs (Bryher's analyst), and even several film reviews by Moore. The trio also made the avant-garde film <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> , starring Paul and Eslanda Robeson along with H.D., with its intricate montage work, what Macpherson called "transferential," a word he used to denote slippage and emotional transfer between shots and characters.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> I point to these later collaborations for their almost overstated fusion of the erotic and aesthetic, pointing up a necessary refining and expansion of modernist love, friendship, and collaboration. I realize these are large terrains, but I contend that these categories overlap, are not uniformly positive, and require greater biographical nuance within an historical context of stigmatized non-heterosexual bonds. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like the later "transferential" relationship enacted with H.D. and Macpherson, with its origins in the group's psychoanalytic reading of desire and transference, Bryher's relationship to Moore between 1920 and 1923 sets forth a template for Bryher's future collaborations. Transference, in this context, becomes a form of collaboration, a psychological as well as aesthetic enactment. Given that I rely on the process of psychoanalytic transference throughout this piece and that, to my knowledge, my application of them to modernist writers and lives has not been tried, I first sketch out the terminology's main elements. For Freud, transference "emerges as <span style="font-style:italic;">the most powerful resistance</span> to the treatment," given that this resistance will be to the uncovering the prototypic unfulfilled desires from early development: "If someone's need for love is not entirely satisfied by reality, he is bound to approach every new person whom he meets with libidinal anticipatory ideas" which become played out with the analyst.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> James Strachey summarized this early theorizing in 1934: "Transference was regarded predominantly as a <span style="font-style:italic;">libidinal</span> phenomenon. It was suggested that in everyone there existed a certain number of unsatisfied libidinal impulses, and that whenever some new person came upon the scene these impulses were ready to attach themselves to him."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Further developing my working terminology, in Freud's language, transferences are enabled as "new editions or facsimiles of the impulses and fantasies that are aroused and made conscious during the progress of the analysis; but they have this peculiarity . . . that they replace some earlier person by the person of the physician."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Through transference, love that is "thrown by the patient upon the analyst provided the necessary extra force to induce his ego to give up its resistances, undo the repressions and adopt a fresh solution of its ancient problems" ("Therapeutic Action," 53). Furthermore, transferences can be negative or positive: not all the emotions unleashed are loving; some are hostile and aggressive ("Therapeutic Action," 53).</p>
<p>Even though both Freud and Strachey broaden the occurrence of transference outside of analysis to "whenever a new person came on the scene," strictly speaking, transference would seem to necessitate analyst and analysand. Thus it would seem inappropriate to apply it to two writers, given that they are not replicating the analytic situation in its closed enactment and with, of course, the analyst usually positioned as the re of authority. Counter-transference would allow for a two-way projection of libidinal desires, but depends upon an initial transference and control by the analyst; by contrast, collaboration occurs between a duo that is not fixed, and the positions of analyst and analysand (as it were) ostensibly shift continually.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Moore and Bryher were not in analysis with one another. Nevertheless, I argue that transference theory offers potent and appropriate language for discussing what Freud called the "conditions for loving," wherein an analysand replicates an earlier prototype or the "infantile roots of her love."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Transference love, then, according to Roy Schafer, "is sheerly repetitive, merely a new edition of the old, artificial and regressive [. . .] and to be dealt with chiefly by translating it back into its infantile terms. [. . .] On the other hand, transference is a piece of real life that is adapted to the analytic purpose" ("Conditions for Loving," 405). The blurring of the analytic situation and "real" life is already present in Freud's provocative assertion: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "it is true that the [transference-] love consists of new editions of old traits and that it repeats infantile reactions. But this is the essential character of every state of being in love. There is no such state which does not reproduce infantile prototypes."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> For my purposes, it is helpful to think of Bryher and Moore's charged relationship—with its regressions, repressions, projections—as creating a proto-analytic situation, where correspondence, writing, and publications became markers of the "latest edition" of an earlier incarnation of shadowy love, or the "conditions of love." I construe literary collaboration as possessing a more erotized, emotional contour when transference is included as part of the equation.</p>
<p>I particularly seize upon Bryher's bond with Moore to examine the mechanics of creativity in the age of inversion where to "transfer" emotions and experiences had plural meanings for those who experienced at least some of their desires as unwanted or misdirected. Through this prism, I shed light on how modernist same-sex collaborations functioned, as did theirs, within a complicated mesh of power, debt, desire, and friendship. Bryher's relationship to Moore constituted an aesthetic erotic conjunction, supplementary to the poet's "aesthetic domestic conjunction" with her mother, who must be deferred to as Moore's most significant collaborator as well as transferential object.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> In aesthetic-erotic conjunctions, intellectual imperatives converge with erotic and economic ones; collaboration then becomes a matter of different forms of psychic interaction that extend beyond literal publication of a jointly conceived work to a larger field of exchanges. In the period I examine, Bryher and Moore engaged in the excitement of mutual criticism and recognition, the first flush of friendship, identification, homoerotic flirtation, and disavowal of erotic attachment. Their significant, if elusive, literary and transferential collaboration has passed mostly under the radar, yet it had immediate impact upon Bryher's development, upon Moore and, in less quantifiable ways, upon modernism more generally.</p>
<p>I here first lay out the arc of the essay as a whole before taking up each phase in this complex relationship. To highlight Bryher's and Moore's "courtship" as a form of transference, I zoom in upon a forgotten work and document of modernism, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Bryher's novelistic telling of her travel in America. It is a narrative that foregrounds her developing "romance" with Moore and projects her own sense of herself as male adventurer, as well as her desire to mimic and reframe her father's mobility as shipping magnate. Drafted during Bryher's cross-country journey from 1920 through 1921 and culled from her correspondence with Moore, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> (published as <span style="font-style:italic;">West</span> in 1925) provides an intriguing site to examine their collaboration.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> A back and forth exchange of letters (as if part of an ongoing analysis) during this period helped create <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, given that Bryher incorporated Moore's language, and then sent the manuscript back with this recycled material for approval, and then for marketing (at Moore's invitation). In Bryher's seeking approval, taking on both the role of the young, still-developing writer and rescuer, Moore became a kind of "auxiliary super-ego," the role Strachey assigns the analyst ("Therapeutic Action," 61). Moore responded to the portrait of herself by Bryher as speedily enacted (written as it was upon the pair's early friendship), a reaction underscored in her further displeasure at Bryher's hasty and, for Moore, unexpected, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even "inconvenient," first marriage of convenience on Valentine's Day 1921 to Robert McAlmon. Outside <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, "wedding bells do ring for friends," only not for my two friends, or erotic collaborators, but for Bryher and their mutual associate, McAlmon. The marriage was followed by the funding, editing and publication of Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> (July 1921) by the gang of three—Bryher (at the helm), H.D., and McAlmon. <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, I suggest, was a form of unwanted ravishment of Moore by Bryher, whose sense of being seduced by Moore replicates the conventional transferential trajectory, while it does not erase Moore's own erotic feelings for Bryher. Meanwhile, Moore repudiated <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> while "feeling flattered and encouraged by what she calls 'the chivalry of the undertaking.'" <sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Bryher's "transferred" affections that went into showcasing <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> coincided with Moore's continued efforts to market <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>. In 1922, Bryher published <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span>, a book of poems generally dismissed as "backward," evidently influenced by Lowell and H.D.'s imagism; the poems express an extremely open eroticism, and bear some traces of what she wrote about Moore in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> as we will see.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Subsequent to these historic personal and aesthetic events, Moore's later poem "Marriage" , was largely prompted, as Patricia Willis reveals, by Bryher's marriage and Moore's own identification with those who need to apply their "criminal ingenuity" to "avoid / it."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Bryher's literal wedding thus helped to beget "Marriage," a commentary upon those included as well as excluded by the heterosexual imperative, containing a personal address to Bryher as Eve "so handsome / she gave me a start." "Marriage" confirmed an ongoing behind-the-scenes collaboration, based on a desire to nurse perceptions and projections, drawing upon and recreating the other's writing and communication, formulated in the poem's borrowed quip: "'I should like to be alone; / why not be alone together?'" (This paradox anticipates D.W. Winnicott's description of the intimacy of analysis as "being alone together") ("Conditions for Loving," 411). Such an "ideal" mode of collaboration, without explicit contract (alone and together), exists along both the axis of the aesthetic—including the pragmatic aims of being published—and the erotic. In an earlier manuscript of the poem, Elizabeth W. Young discovered an excised line from the drafted beginning of the poem: "This institution should one say enterprise which is universally associated with the fear of loss."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Yet it is rather the fear of loss that precludes erotic adventure and deep attachment. Moore's ceaseless marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>—a book she didn't fully endorse but which expressed Bryher's affection for her—suggests that Moore continued to hold on to the disarticulated fantasy of their flirtation. Marketing was a way of consolidating the pair's bond: <span style="font-style:italic;">to get someone published</span> (crude as this sounds) can have an erotic dimension, standing in for a publication of bans for a marriage. In this case, it also nicely calls up Freud's idea of transference as minting a "new edition" of a loved prototype. With such biographical and literary events in mind, my essay calls for a reconration of modernist collaborations between women through the emotional thoroughfare of transference.</p>
<p>At first glance, Bryher's overtures towards Moore may look more like non-collaboration, or the acts of someone in need of monopolizing the other. But Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">did</span> "co-labor" with Bryher, and did take her very seriously. In reading drafts and the final copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in 1921, Moore reinforced the image Bryher fashioned of Moore <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as "boy scribe" and eccentric "pterodactyl," even though she found aspects of the manuscript to criticize—this too is part of what we may call negative collaboration. Understandably, inter-subjective collaboration is fraught with projections on both sides, yet where established in correspondence and other writing, it should be considered as part of a broader continuum of creative and affective transference, beyond idealized romantic friendships. If Bryher called upon Moore in her psychic processes of fashioning an identity apart from England and her father (perhaps even apart from H.D.), Moore reinforced a view of her own self as "boyish," both in need of and not in need of "rescue," while she also praised and internalized Bryher's repertoire of male identifications. This, of course, complicates how we regard lesbian desire: both women variously identified as boy-like, which did not exclude their desire for each other. We might think of Moore's multiplicity as incident to Bonnie Costello's apt description of the poet as "kleptomaniac of the mind," in her use of fragments and quotations from many sources;<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> the interpersonal scenario I invoke denotes "liftings" and transfers, collage (slang for marriage),<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> inter-psychic borrowings and identifications.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Before Bryher met Moore in the flesh in September 1920 and began what I am calling the collaborative transference constituted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, she had already been seduced. The courtship was conducted in black and white. I provide here a synopsis of what they knew of each other through published writing. By 1918, H.D. supplanted Amy Lowell as Bryher's primary mentor (Lowell directed Bryher to H.D.'s work). H.D. captured Bryher's complete intellectual and erotic attention; in short, Bryher memorized <span style="font-style:italic;">Sea Garden</span>  before she first sought out the poet in July 1918. She then incorporated H.D. as her poetic "ego-ideal" as they two engaged in their own unusual romance. Moore, I contend, would temporarily divert Bryher's aesthetic and psychological affections. Bryher fell for "The Fish" when it appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in 1918, and at H.D's instruction, Bryher read every poem she could find of Moore's.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> On the one hand, "The Fish," with its submarine explosions and mutilations, conveys the contemporary experience of war; on the other hand, it evoked the freshness of Bryher's beloved Cornwall—the fish, evasive, swift, touching upon bodies of light and texture, while moving in and out of "crevices." The "defiant edifice" of "The Fish" struck a chord that would continue to sound, so that by 1940, Bryher was still writing about it: "I had to be shown Marianne Moore but once I discovered 'wade // through black jade / of the crow-blue mussel shells' I was her prisoner for life."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>But what of Bryher's effect upon Moore? After meeting H.D., Bryher published several poems Moore would have seen, including "Adventure" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bostonian</span> (February 1919) with its plea "Do not pass me like the wind," as well as Bryher's first two forays into prose publication, which evidenced telltale signs of inversion.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> A couple months after H.D. introduced the pair in New York in 1920, Moore praised Bryher's essay "Elizabethan Drama and The Girl-Page" (written in 1918, and published in 1920 in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fortnightly</span>, exploring girls dressed up as boys): "Your 'Girl-Page' has come <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and I hope you do not begrudge me the pleasure I have had from it." She confessed to have copied two paragraphs in her commonplace book, and continued: "I like the exposition of wildness. At the end, 'the imagination of a child joined to the freedom of a boy' sums the thing up very well."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Indeed, this synthesis might encapsulate the psychosexual trajectory of both women who identified strongly with Peter Pan.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure:</span> the Kiss</h1>
<p>One and a half year old Perdita and her nurse in tow, Bryher, and H.D. arrived on September 10, 1920 in New York. In her "Unpublished Autobiography," Perdita dates her first memory to this transatlantic voyage with "two mothers" on the S.S. Adriatic.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> All of her adolescence and early adulthood, America dominated Bryher's fantasies of adventure and creative fulfillment. Her father worried it was unstable and dangerous, but for Bryher, the First World War cast a pall over London, leaving it utterly dead. Imagining that in America she could not only tap into H.D.'s creative sources, but could also strut about in trousers and be as mannish as she liked, she threatened her transatlantic correspondent Lowell that she would come dressed as a boy. Lowell had already written to Bryher that she'd be better off wearing men's clothes in London, warning: "in one of our small Western towns, the speed with which you would find yourself in the lock-up would really astonish you."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Nevertheless, Bryher cut her hair in preparation for the journey, which she considered the most important act of her life up to that point. As it turned out, both America and Lowell disappointed Bryher. However, sometime in September 1920, H.D. arranged a meeting for Moore and Bryher at the historic Hotel Brevoort, and across the tea table was Moore—an idiosyncratic homo-emotional incarnation, a soul mate, who lived with her mother and whom Bryher believed needed rescue from her family. The photo (below) of Bryher taken in Cornwall in 1921 after her return to England from America nicely captures one of Bryher's characteristic poses and would have been close to what Marianne saw when she met Bryher. Although Bryher masqueraded in dresses in New York, this particular stance of boyish defiance was what, as we shall see, Bryher communicated to Moore in her correspondence. The shot of Moore leaning on a ship deck in the summer of 1920 shows the poet just before the pair met. Moore looks plucky, reserved, and sexually indeterminate—a re immediately appealing to Bryher, who had always dreamed of running away to sea. Such were the twin "female masculinities," who identified with and cultivated each other.</p>
<p>In 1920, Moore was thirty-three, and had not yet published her first book. The twenty-six year old Bryher began a campaign of encouraging, teasing, aggravating, promoting, and flirting with the poet. This desire was self-reflexive: Moore was a gender outsider whose own brand of flirtation and liminal position mirrored Bryher's.</p>
<p>Bryher's ongoing drama of self-fashioning included a desire to foster Moore's "development" (a word that obsessed Bryher), and to render it part of her own narrative of "inversion." Leavell has demonstrated that, while Moore probably did not consider herself an "invert," she did recognize a divide between herself and the heterosexual <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  template. After a major crush on William James's daughter, Peggy, a classmate, at Bryn Mawr, where such crushes were an "institution," Moore became a passionate celibate, a "literary bachelor": "[a]lthough she may never have had a sexually intimate relationship, she did participate in what (Adrienne) Rich has defined broadly as a 'lesbian continuum' that can include many forms of 'primary intensity between and among women.'"<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In addition, Bryher's motifs of male identification, adventure, and mobility percolated in her own work. The two also cherished <span style="font-style:italic;">Swiss Family Robinson</span> as well as popular boy's adventure tales. I go further to suggest that Moore was far from asexual, and Bryher was not simply looking for the next great modernist poet; that the pair's mutual identification of female masculinity and transferential collaboration constituted Moore's most likely erotic affair after Peggy James.</p>

<p>A back and forth sparring, an overture in letters, revolving around aesthetic sensibility began in Bryher's pivotal letter to Moore on September 24, 1920 from Santa Barbara, California. She expressed respectful puzzlement and wonder in the face of her new friend's elliptical style:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I am not sure that I have succeeded in discovering the precise meaning of the poems. I have a general impression of a world before the fish age where shells cling to a rock and whether the shell was just a shell knowing its own rock perfectly—the boundary of its own ledges—or whether the shell was the entire world I have neither discovered nor decided.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In some sense, Bryher is asking if the shell <span style="font-style:italic;">knew</span> its eco-relation with the rock, or whether the shell believed it was "the entire world"? To put the implied questions bluntly: did Moore know her limits, crave contact with the larger world, and desire relationship? Perhaps this is a leap, for Moore gave a cool, if gracious, response: "I have had so much curiosity about the world before the fish age that I am pleased to have reminded you of it" (October 17, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span> 134). Yet the "rock" is another re for the Sapphic island. To Bryher, Moore was not of her age, but existed from the perspective of literary experiment at its cutting edge. Moore was thus a perfect "case study" for Bryher's ongoing obsession with the process of development: How do conventions of education and social training hamper it? How does the female or queer artist develop—in isolation or with others? What does she do with her "boyish" proclivities? Bryher casts Moore into a "fish-age," suggestive of a sensual, aqueous world without fixed gender norms; at the same time, throughout her correspondence with Moore, she craves some more definite expression. There is a moment in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Gatsby</span> when a pair of lovers at a grand party is about to kiss, but they never do; for Fitzgerald, this ideal moment before fantasy degrades into reality. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, the kiss never happens, but desire remains in circulation, and was only fulfilled through the contact produced in the pair's manuscript exchange.</p>
<p>Within the time frame examined here, Moore read the draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in progress; she encouraged the book and then vigorously tried to market it. There are at least two narratives expressed in this interchange: Moore's variegated letters, both flirting and resisting, in response to Bryher's urgings in letters and her draft, and Bryher's incorporation of this correspondence into her own "plot." These women took letters very seriously, so that an epistolary form allowed them to work out creative processes, express divergent desires tantamount to sexual activity, and to contribute to a larger exchange within modernism.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after their meeting, Moore introduced Bryher to McAlmon, another up and coming poet at the periphery of her circle. He co-edited a low-budget American-centered journal with William Carlos Williams, <span style="font-style:italic;">Contact</span>. H.D. encouraged Bryher's separate friendships with both Moore and McAlmon. During the first couple of months in America, Bryher sent Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> before launching upon <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> (inspired by Moore). Bryher wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>, a memoir/novel begun in 1916 and published first in Britain in July 1920 by Constable and then in America in December the same year, due to Lowell's marketing efforts (the edition contains an explanatory preface by Lowell). Bryher regarded her boarding school experience as a "violation of the spirit."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Bryher sent Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> while traveling across America with H.D. and family. This first novel/memoir of Bryher's further fit into the epoch's growing recognition of the existence of the so-called "third sex,"<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> and captured Bryher's apparently insoluble predicament: "Her one regret was that she was a girl . . . She tried to forget, to escape any reference to being a girl . . . She was sure if she hoped enough she would turn into a boy."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Moore praised <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> in a letter: "[t]he positiveness and absence of exaggeration in the narration give it an authoritativeness which is very striking and instinctiveness and intenseness of the wording, give to a great many of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the lines, the force of poetry" (November 29th, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 136). Bryher's experience of gender eccentricity struck a chord with Moore: "the great feature of [<span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>]" is "[t]he exposition of the baffled sense one has of being outside what it is one's birthright to enjoy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 137). Moore's largely favorable review the following year (in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> 70, May 1921) praised the book as "a flower cluster mounted on a tall spike," while noting that "in human development the flowering stage is many times this side of maturity." <sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Moore's combination of gender connotations—"cluster" "spike"—suggests that the "flowering stage" may not arrive according to social dictates or expectations. "Juxtaposed," she observed, "we have impetuosity and philosophic endurance of what cannot be helped," while also noting that Bryher's "envying a boy his freedom and his clothes," was a "view" that is "somewhat curtailed" (note Moore's witty pun) for "woman is more nearly at liberty to assume man's dress than man is able to avail himself of the opportunities for self-expression afforded by the variations in color and fabric which a woman may use."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Although H.D. regularly corresponded with Moore during this period, the emotional tenor of their letters never seemed to fire any attraction. Despite separate intrigues, H.D. and Bryher managed to forge a new family, including H.D.'s daughter, Perdita, and H.D.'s mother (Mrs. Doolittle was dubbed the "Beaver" by the set). Together they made a pilgrimage from New York City to California and back. During her trip West, Bryher corresponded with Moore and McAlmon, all the while penning <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> with both poets as characters in it, Moore taking center stage. The travelogue combines fiction and memoir, incorporating her ongoing correspondence with Moore. Its thinly disguised characters include Bryher as Nancy, H.D. as Helga, Lowell as Lyall, Moore as Anne, and McAlmon as Magnus West. <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> thus binds multiple strands of Bryher and Moore's unusual romance of ambivalent but mutual attraction and exchange. Moore as Anne Trollope is not a purely platonic friend, but a re of attraction: "[h] er austere boyish head, her flushed face about the prim white collar was vivid with excitement" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 35). Enamored with the "boyish head," Nancy demands Anne "send [her] everything" she has "ever written."</p>
<p>Written as the "adventure" was unfolding, the novel/memoir records the arrival "at the gates of New York"—"War and the old world were eastward in the blackness. Lights were ahead of them . . . rifted stars . . . an outline . . . swinging lanterns" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 22)—the short meeting with Moore (as Anne), and follows the menagerie from New York to Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to Carmel and back through Los Angeles to Monrovia. From Monrovia to the Mexican border, they confront orange orchards, competing with advertisements for Sunkist, Pasadena's Million Dollar Homes, and a booster's slogan: "Come to California and Forget You're Forty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 123). They leave the land of broken dreams and ripe fruit, speeding by train through Arizona—with the hot sun, red canyons, white cattle bones and sage. They pass through open fields, and a blizzard in Chicago. When Nancy arrives back in New York, she has seen an alien world, imperfect but wondrous. Rounding out her adventure as its homo-emotional apex, she has lunch with Anne in Greenwich Village. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>While in Santa Barbara, Bryher had prodded Moore (in the same letter where she affectionately situated Moore in "the fish-age") to publish a poetry volume because she explains "it is a little difficult to get people interested in your work when it has to be sought for in the sparse pages of magazines."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> The advice proffered by Bryher's letters parallel that of her fictional character, Nancy, urging Anne to publish. For Bryher, we recall, Moore's poems had a porous relationship between "edge" and center. To be at the edge was also the state of mind Bryher navigated as she traveled—a state where collaboration was conditioned by distance, movement and indeterminate edges.</p>
<p>After Bryher praised Moore's attractive difficulty in this letter, she speculated upon the pair's possible differences: "I imagine we are so different in thought that it makes for barriers. I should have been very happy in Carthage watching elephants with Tyrian laurels crush the marigolds as they moved along the paths while you, I fear, would prefer the thin lines of a herd of gazelles that merge in with desert and are swift and quiet" (<span style="font-style:italic;">RML</span>). Bryher's discontent with the conspicuous consumption of Santa Barbara ("Everyone is rich, everyone has one, two or three motorcars, and there is no a sign of wildness or freedom"), returned the meditative traveler back to Moore's poems:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Since the war in England most girls go about in riding breeches and old coats in the country and I thought out here I could get into them again all the time but certainly it is not possible here. It is much too civilized. I liked New York so much and I hope to come back there for two or three months next spring. To me it was so beautiful and free of the sense of death that hangs over all of Europe since the war. I feel Europe is a bleak nightmare I do not wish to remember. [. . .] I like "Dock Rats" best of the poems but all interested me very much. As I wrote I see a cold sea, a few rocks, one or two shells thinking about the fish to be born perhaps in a million years; all sharp lines. <span style="font-style:italic;">I hope soon the poems will be collected into a volume</span></p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">RML</span>; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even though Moore had not met Bryher when the former published "Dock Rats" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span> , it anticipates the entrance of the shipping heiress into her life and iterates the call for adventure and "a good / place to come / home to", summed up in various vessels the poem catalogues ("square-rigged four-master, the liner, / the battleship, like the two- /thirds submerged section of an iceberg" and "ferry boat," hinting at Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry." It is understandable why Bryher singles the poem out, considering its publication in a known experimental venue, its reminder of her father's industry, and her voracious desire for travel: "to one who has been accustomed / to it, shipping is the / most congenial thing in the world" ("Dock Rats," <span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 247). The poem also begs the question if Bryher knew (perhaps through H.D.) that her family called Moore "rat" (she will by December). Still the letter (as quoted above) represents how Bryher's imagination was becoming entangled (together and alone) with Moore's. "As I wrote I see" indicate Bryher's effort to make her letters catch up with present experience, ready to transmute into <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>. The passage further underscores her sense of Moore's style—"the fish to be born perhaps in a million years" is both archaic and oriented towards the future. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In her letter to Bryher dated October 15, 1920, Moore emphasized her new friend's desire for adventure as well as her own:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I hope you have been able to wear your riding breeches and do as you please. Have you found any horses? I cannot imagine anything more delightful than riding through the woods by the sea, in California. Unless it were to look at the elephants of which you speak—in Carthage. I hope that I don't give a false impression of myself in my poems for there is nothing I love more, than the concrete and there is an especial romance I think, about elephants</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 134).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Just as Bryher projected herself out among the rocks to see "all sharp lines," Moore participated in Bryher's fantasy "romance" of Carthage and elephants, and reinforced the depiction of herself in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is an "especial romance," but it is also a survey of American prohibition, commoditization, superficial friendliness and "suburbia gone reckless" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 52). A billboard epitomizes slogan optimism: "Plenty of Water. Plenty of Sun. Settle in Albert and Forget your Neurasthenia" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 123). Yet while <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is filled with Bryher's critique of America, the book's main drive is to pursue Anne, as representative American experimentalist. Helga, who "bade [Nancy] live," resides in the background, an interlocutor to poke fun at Nancy's past exaltation of America—"It must be quite a day since you told me that America is the future and that the only hope of the human race lies in the West. What has happened?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 48). Helga's poetry evokes "[f] lower leaf and salt water and a mind like a bird, diving everywhere"; Nancy as narrator then highlights the more restrained Anne, with her "submarine poems and her rock scratchings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 69). In plucking out what she can from their correspondence, rewriting it into <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Bryher thus collaborates with Moore as a psychic presence within the novel-memoir, akin to what Moore does with the texts she admires and refashions in her poems, letters, and reviews. But it is more than simply quoting the other; Bryher and Moore respond to each other in a highly tuned intimacy.</p>
<p>Just as Helga makes Nancy the butt of her own idealism, the real life Bryher courted and flirted with Moore, growing ever closer, even devising a pet name for her (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157-8). In response to Bryher's inquiry, Moore offers Bryher a multitude of names: "I shall like any name you select for me; am in my family, a weasel, a coach-dog, a water-rat, a basilisk and an alligator and could be an armadillo, a bull-frog or anything that seems suitable to you" (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157). This flirtatious pliancy with someone outside Moore's family reflected a singular familiarity. Based on an excerpt of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> she read in December 1920, Moore happily accepted the nickname, Pterodactyl. The literary text <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> thus sealed this appellation, and anchored the exchange. Bryher's portrait of the Pterodactyl Moore in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> has "heraldic" imagist force:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Beyond the window the tall width of the station held the summer sky on the square ledge of its roof. When the evening darkened gold would leap, barbaric fashion, in beads and rings along the midway floors. Anne leaned back, her hands folded on her lap, like some <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  heraldic version of a pterodactyl stiffly watching from its Jurassic rock, sea anemones open and close to the rhythm of the tides.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 39)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The description recruited Moore's identification, bearing the influence of "The Fish."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> In this light, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> seems almost written <span style="font-style:italic;">for her</span>—as a plea for Moore to collect her poems in a volume and to encourage Moore to come away to Europe or somewhere else exotic for an adventure. This small fragment of inter-psychic collaboration suggested how Bryher used her novel/memoir as a courtship, inter-cutting Moore's likes and dislikes, while wrestling with her dismay that America did not offer an immediate "going wild."</p>
<p>The process of writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is akin to two films (at least) playing simultaneously: Bryher incorporates Moore's letters into her travel novel, and into her fantasy of Anne Trollope swimming among the seaweed and anemones. At the same time, the book records Bryher's post-war shock and reflects her relatively new relationship to H.D.—which was ostensibly overtly erotic.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> In Carmel, Nancy feels "billeted," given three movie crews are setting up scenes, firing guns, creating explosions (she was trying to escape the war, she cries out). Bryher records a funny scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: several takes of a rescue in the waves are shot while a journalist snaps pictures of the filming with her Kodak; onlookers, among them, Mrs. Tinker admires the star, Martha Heywood (in real life, Mary Pickford):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>'Martha, Martha,' the crowd rose with homage. The re kissed her fingers to them, stopped, called her maid.</p>
<p>'You can see she is a good woman,' old Mrs. Tinker sighed. 'She never takes off her wedding ring. Not even in a scene like this where she is supposed to be fifteen.'</p>
<p>'But she was divorced last month!'</p>
<p>'Oh, no, it wasn't legal. She had not been in residence long enough.'</p>
<p>Martha held up her hand for the crowd to watch. The ring was covered with a thick flesh-coloured substance.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 88)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In truth, Mary Pickford had been divorced in March 1920 in Reno. The headlines of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> in that month declaimed that Pickford pledged never to marry again, but in light of her subsequent marriage to Douglas Fairbanks the same month, this anecdote is not only interesting film gossip; it also directly underscores Bryher's own considerations of the rituals of matrimony as artifice, American prudishness, and sentimentality (that is Mrs. Tinker's naïve reaction). In spite of her sense of the film crew's unwanted invasion of Carmel, Bryher also penned an article "Mary Pickford in California," published in December 1920.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Bryher's inclusion of the filming scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> oddly comments on Bryher's ménage, her incipient "false" union with McAlmon, and her attachment to Moore, who as Anne, is depicted as mounted on a rock; similarly, her piece on Pickford features a photograph of "Martha" rescuing a dying sailor on a rock and a film child on her lap.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>By January 1921, within four months of meeting Moore on only a few short occasions in the midst of debating numerous topics, including Carthage, fashion limits <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  upon women, her own writing before she met Moore, and both women's publishing possibilities, Bryher had made it clear that she viewed Moore's life as too limited. Bryher threatened to rescue Moore from what she perceived as the poet's confined circumstances, which paralleled both her own condition in England as well as her novel's conclusion, as we shall see. Bryher further wants to cut Marianne's luxuriant hair, and take her on exotic travels (Moore to Bryher; January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141). Repeated in the memoir-novel, Nancy describes Anne as "'really a young Byzantine scribe, all strange colours and angles,'" exclaiming to Helga: "'I should like to cut her hair short, her wonderful hair. Break her from everything to which she is accustomed and plunge her into a new world'"; Helga, meanwhile, wishes Nancy "'could try the experiment'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 102).</p>
<p>Echoing the above passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and other letters from Bryher, Moore dissociates herself as third person, or rather third creature: "The pterodactyl has often thought of shortening its hair" (January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 142), further objectifying the "pterodactyl": "[i]ts craving for peacock blue is the scandal of its rock." In Moore's fantasy about cutting her own hair, there was a coy yet erotic submission to the novel-memoir's suggestion, though Moore is already looking sexually indeterminate in photographs of the period. "Pterodactyl has an open mind with regard to Freud," the January letter continued. And then: "The pterodactyl's conscience hurts it." With a mock confession of guilt, her signature expressed both submission and resistance: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Love to H.D. Your trusting but disobedient</span>, pterodactyl."</p>
<p>Moore's fixation upon Bryher surfaces in her correspondence not only with Bryher, but also with H.D. as well as her brother. In the middle of one train of thought in a letter to H.D, she asks abruptly: "So B. is considered 'cute'?" (January 11, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 139). Though this query may be small, it points to her interest in Bryher's appearance. Although she had known Bryher for several months, Moore wrote to her brother, with the breathless enthusiasm she reserved for delicious gossip, a description of what Bryher planned to wear the next day to tea: "She looks as if she were 18 or twenty but is 26, had some beautiful Empress Josephine clothes Hilda says which she discarded for silks and suits when she turned artist. She is going to wear a cute black silk dress with short sleeves tomorrow with a red pattern of little flowers in circles and a high, low neck cut square" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143). Moore characteristically dwelt upon clothing and fabric, while signaling her attraction and ambivalence towards the rather femme (in this incarnation) rich girl "turned artist."</p>
<p>The very writing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> between 1920 and 1921, as the pair exchanged letters, marked an unusual courtship and complex transference which characterized Bryher as "hasty" and commanding, with Moore confessedly "not swift" and "disobedient." In the crucial letter of January 23, 1921, with her first signature as "your trusting but disobedient, pterodactyl," Moore's tone was playfully defiant, deflecting Bryher's insistence that she write and "forward [her] novel." This unpublished novel was evidently one of the confidences she shared with Bryher, yet she protested: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But I am telling the truth when I say that if I had all the time in the world, I should not write anything for some years . . . I should like to look into certain things and <span style="font-style:italic;">make up my mind</span> with regard to the relevance or irrelevance of certain other things; . . . I have no swiftness. . . . The library is to some extent an incubus. . . . On the whole we live like anchorites . . .</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141-2<span style="font-style:italic;">;</span> emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Where Bryher "got" Marianne wrong, the letter advises, is in expecting gazelle-like swiftness in producing poetry or prose. She had let on to H.D. and Bryher she had started a novel, but she subsequently recants its readiness or plausibility.</p>
<p>Near the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, the chapter "Mushrooms and Pistachio Ice" (after what Anne orders for lunch) begins: "The Dactyl waited. A hasty message had summoned it. It was disguised in an Alpine hat, a frog-green coat and skirt. But unmistakable Jurassic eyes were swift to greet them and it hunched forward with decisive steps, fearful yet assured" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 145). Byher's attraction to the pterodactyl appears in the poem "The Pool" (also a H.D. title) from <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span>: "Has no wing touched your cheek? / Is there no bird / to weave a nest between your sullen limbs / and hatch a songster, / (amber with lizard eyes) / to chirp above your phrases: " Love, love, love . . ." Notable is the poem's explicit sexuality as well as the phrase "(amber with lizard eyes)," echoing her description of Moore as "prehistoric" and now part of a series of poems called "Songs from the Stone Age," unwittingly calling up the language of transference which purportedly takes one back to "ancient" longings and early object choices. Meanwhile, in this scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Nancy speculates that the jazz in the background at lunch is all that holds back chaos and the "prehistoric": "Had it not been for the sound the shapes would have fallen apart, black-and-white, orange, grey fur, into some entangled prehistoric heap, smoldering without purpose in the too white air" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 147). To Nancy's relentless effort to convince the poet to leave New York, Anne replies: "'Dactyls don't have to be rescued. They rescue themselves when the time comes'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 145).</p>
<p>In its bid to "rescue" the Dactyl, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> attacks the "reactionary women" who have forgotten the "horror" and "awfulness" , projecting her own dilemma upon Anne:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Why did Anne carry it on, this Victorian tradition? . . . [I]t clashed with her hair, that curious bright forest colour, with her body that had the <span style="font-style:italic;">austere outline of a young scribe's form</span>, and with the bright mosaic of her mind. Her shrinking from life was masculine rather than a feminine gesture. It was the <span style="font-style:italic;">boy's denial of himself</span> for some misunderstood ideal</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 159; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even if Anne (or Moore) did not accede to this reading, this passage intimates that the pterodactyl (and by extension Moore) is construed as "inverted" (like Bryher). Nancy demonstrates both a desire to "have" and to "be" this masculine young scribe who she wanted to liberate from "denial."</p>
<p>In reply to Bryher's conception of her as stunted, Moore claimed that her "ice-bound state" couldn't be blamed on bad education of the kind elucidated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>; she <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  jokes: "You could not see any education that I have had, with a microscope" (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 137). According to Willis, "Bryher feared Moore was suffering the fate she tried to avoid <span style="font-style:italic;">while Moore felt alarm at Bryher's adventures to which she might have succumbed had her circumstances been different</span>" (emphasis added).<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> To some extent, Bryher imagined and inflated Moore's narrow straits. While Moore didn't envy Bryher's money, she might have imagined that with greater economic surety she would have more freedom. She admired the mobility of the "girl-page," wistfully telling Bryher, for instance, she wanted to fence (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 138), and then asking in the next month: "Does your father ever fence now? I am much excited to hear of his prowess, not to speak of your own" (January 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>).<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In this letter, Moore deflects Bryher's intense desire to bring her off her "rock" through complimentary spars and provides some basis for the depiction of her as seeking a larger sphere of action. In other words, within the correspondence, as depicted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, fantasy and reality blur as they do in psychoanalytic depictions of transference.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to her brother John, "the Badger," Moore expressed "absolute stupefaction" in the face of Bryher's continual reiteration that the poet should be out having adventures. Moore quotes Bryher "saying that she can't see the use of her [Marianne] being cooped up and kept to work when she might be writing, or riding an elephant." Moore's brother had not met Bryher, but he knew of her from his sister's letters. Bryher had proposed, offering the carrot, that <span style="font-style:italic;">if</span> Moore finished her novel, her father [Sir Ellerman] would finance an expedition. This trip, as Moore ambivalently appreciated, was "extended on the point of a sword," and echoing Bryher, that she'd have to behave like a "'good pterodactyl that will come out of its rock'" (January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141). To her brother, then, Moore gently mocked Bryher's "Dadda" who would arrange a cabin on the White Star Line, yet she considered "giving in": "I don't suppose we can go but I think there is some possibility that we might go. Mole [nickname of Mary Warner Moore] doesn't know what to say about it either. The library might let me go but if there is a possibility of Mole's being more worried than benefited by going, it would be out of the question." Bryher often set conditions, but Moore had her own conditions, teased back, while admitting that riding elephants and such places as Carthage tantalized her. To evade Bryher, Moore admitted to all sorts of faults, of having "shyness, scepticisms, lethargy and other tiresome qualities." She begged Bryher to "put up with her." Even after her marriage, Bryher tried to coax Moore into adventure abroad (with the ruse of a typing assignment); as Moore writes, "cables from Winifred Ellerman this week. One, 'please come secretary summer' the other 'come summer'" (to John Warner Moore, May 3, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157). To Bryher, she refused such "musical therapeutics," and framed her position both dramatically and ambiguously: "I should not like at this time to leave the library unless it were to save a life or unless the situation here, for me, were so unbearable that by staying there wouldn't be anything of me left to go when I did want to go" (May 3, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 158). This was a convoluted way of expressing that it was choice and obligation that kept her at the library and at home, and only the most drastic circumstances could take her away; still she left the door open for wanting "to go" at some point, a confession held up in a letter the following <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  week, also dramatically expressed: "I am only too eager to be in England this minute but I cannot come before next year even if by that time it should be too late" (May 9, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 159).</p>
<p>In her novelistic version, Nancy taunts: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Sitting here like a pterodactyl on a rock afraid to move. I suppose you feel that if you fell off it into the sea you'd enjoy swimming among the anemones" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 150). Anne's response, like Moore's in real life, rejects Nancy's proposition: "'I should like to come with you,' Anne's eyes were bright, 'but it is not possible.'" Perhaps with some self-mocking, Bryher parses Anne's reply from Moore's letters: "'Your kindness is gratifying that you wish me to be with you. But if I am to write a novel it may not be for some years. I know I am not ready. You see,' Anne cut in two a large black mushroom slowly, 'I feel if I am to create anything I shall do it when I am, say, forty-five'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 148).</p>
<p>Moore had written provocatively to her brother: "When there are no strangers about she is most sprightly. Piggy [Moore's name for McAlmon] has a bad crush on [Bryher] . . . Winifred wants Mole and me to go over to England with them for the trip and to spend a month or two. She tried most of one evening to get me to promise to take a check for a Mediterranean trip as soon as she got it from her father. She said, 'Dactyl if you don't take it delicately with <span style="font-style:italic;">a swish of your tail</span> it will be very awkward. You see my father wants to encourage me to get rid of money'" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143, emphasis added). The date is significant: "Piggy" courted Bryher, while Bryher courted "Dactyl." Moore knew from Bryher that her father planned to bring Bryher back to England, but she was flabbergasted when the next day at her tea party, H.D. and Bryher announced that the "ceremony" at City Hall with McAlmon had taken place a couple hours before. Moore called this the "worst event" of a busy two weeks, a veritable "earthquake" (to John Warner Moore, February 20, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 144). For Moore, the marriage short-circuited what had been developing between the pair over the few months preceding, what can only be called a collaborative and transferential romance lacking a literal kiss or consummation.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, with her menagerie about to cast off for Europe, the purportedly "real marriage" with McAlmon is elided, while Bryher's imprecations for Moore to abandon her virginal existence constitute the book's emotional core. New York is all imagist clarity: "In the February morning the city became sharp as a photographic plate magnified many times. [. . .] The tallest skyscraper become a point on the horizon. The waves beat more swiftly, the sea was before them. Europe lay eastward; ready for rediscovery" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 191). In the chapter of lunching on mushrooms and pistachio, Nancy tries to woo the Dactyl by praising this very photographic ability in her: "And nobody else can make those hard little photographs. Of elephants and coral reefs. You ought to come and catalogue Europe before all the beauty of it disappears" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 148-9). The Dactyl remains the anchor point of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> with the very writing of the book a kind of seduction plot. Although it ends with dissatisfaction, the book offers a tantalizing model of inter-subjective transference. As if completing this courtship at a later date in an "especial" romance, Moore eventually sent Bryher a provocative lock of her hair.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Continuing a dialogue with Bryher's description of her <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as shell on a rock, and after Bryher's abrupt marriage, Moore was "impatient" to see <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: "You are by no means off the rock; nor shall a husband share it with us" (May 9, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 159). Thus Moore placed herself in the scene Bryher had depicted, and then superimposed Bryher with her on the "Jurassic rock" surrounded by sea anemones; there was no room for a husband. Even after the marriage, she would sign her letters with either "loving" or "affectionately" and "Dactyl"; by 1932, the signature cooled to merely initials.</p>
<p>When Bryher, McAlmon, H.D., and Perdita returned to Europe as a new ménage in 1921, it was as if Bryher had lived out several lifetimes. This period represented an extraordinary set of interpersonal and creative revolutions. What can these overlapping triangles tell us about the unique creative processes of these poets at this cultural moment of "homosexual panic" that motivates in part the rich daughter (really a boy) to marry the bohemian bisexual poet, McAlmon, rather than remain in the awkward position of "companion" to H.D. and proto-lover to Moore? Bryher's marriage, oddly conservative in light of her simultaneous efforts to wrench Moore from her "narrow limits," was a concession to her parents as well as a stratagem to pursue yet another vision of creative co-operation—to give McAlmon an allowance for travel to Paris, and at the same time, to retain her own autonomy. This "experiment" ran parallel to her "impossible" relationship with the erotically independent Moore. He became a surrogate for the evasive Dactyl.</p>
<p>For their part, Bryher's parents were delighted to have a son-in-law to supplement Bryher's "queer" relationship—though they probably didn't detect the queerness in Bryher's friendship with Moore. Moore wrote H.D.: "I have just had a letter from Bryher which makes me very happy. She says her father and mother are pleased with Robert and I hope they are. Perhaps I exaggerate the momentousness of marriage" (March 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 149). Moore took pleasure in the family's obliviousness: "I can only smile very ironically at Robert's harmonizing so nicely with the family, in his adaptability to Perdita." By late March, Moore was still trying to make the best of the inconvenient marriage; she imagined Piggy's new wardrobe, deflecting erotic feeling through the bond she shared with Bryher—a love of men's clothing:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The sample, nipped from your belt, is beautiful—the color, and I like the peculiar, napless feel of it. I thought when you were here, that perhaps black velvet and gray Japanese silk would be becoming to you, or some shade of blue but when I saw your pink pongee with the embroidered pockets, I saw that you ought to wear deep pink or have a little of it on anything you wear. Old gold has an irresistible attraction for me; so has orange. . . . I wish I could see Robert's ties, suits and riding-breeches. Enthralled as I am by women's clothes I am much more enthralled by men's</p>
<div class="attrib">(to Bryher, March 28, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Moore's most immediate outward expression about the marriage was concern over Bryher's emotional state. Of Piggy, she wrote, "I am still shocked by him. Anyone who is so ignorant as not to know that he was doing Bryher an irreparable injury by doing as he did, is not fit to marry her" (to H.D., March 27, 1921, <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 149). Alternately, she lamented: "There is no such thing as a prudent marriage; marriage is a Crusade; there <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is always tragedy in it; in the case of one with so finely adjusted a mechanism as Bryher, one's spiritual motive power is sure to receive a backset." By 1923, she could memorialize her various affective responses in "Marriage" through a collage aesthetic.</p>
<p>Moore's many comments on Bryher's marriage reflect her understanding of the "motive" of such beards, but also her hurt, and moreover, her sense of abandonment on the collaborative "Jurassic rock." Further, her reactions are difficult to disentangle from the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, five months after Bryher's taking Piggy as groom. Produced by a triumvirate (Bryher, H.D. and McAlmon), the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> was not, at its birth, what Moore wanted. Moore understood the collaborating trio (especially Bryher) admired and also infantilized her by arranging publication without her involvement and consent. Collaboration as a form of negative transference, as this set of aesthetic-emotional details represent, has a murky side.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"<span style="font-style:italic;">Your now naked</span> Dactyl": <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> and the Marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>
</h1>
<p>It is seldom noted that in reviewing <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> and purveying <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure,</span> Moore took on the role of ambassador for Bryher; at the same time, she used the opportunity to point out Bryher's hastiness in publication. In November of 1920, two months after their meeting, a reciprocal offer of help seemed purely business: she thanked Bryher "for all [her] care in telling [her] of modern English writers" while advising her to send one of her essays to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> or to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yale Review</span>, though she wasn't sure of their editorial policy (November 29, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 135-7). This letter, after sharing her kindred dislike of dolls as "the dreariest, tawdriest things in the world," Moore closed with gratitude: "Thank you for looking after my interest in the matter of the essays. Do, if I am not burdening you, secure me anything you can." Both thus conceived of each other as capable of creating venues for their writing, another stitch in the collaborative skein. By December, when <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> was inaugurated, the exchange took on stronger emotional nuances, including Moore's fear of having her friend rejected, and subsequently in the following year, her own sense of being chaperoned too strongly in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>.</p>
<p>As Moore's letters testify, her "no" did not mean a "yes," as Cyrena N. Pondrom conjectures.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Moore's resulting sense of disempowered vulnerability as "your now naked Dactyl" (her closing), presented a vivid self-comparison for one so enamored of armor and fur. The trio, we may consider, were making an effort, albeit a clumsy one, to consolidate an aesthetic vision, and claim Moore as "one of their own" apart from the more entrenched the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span>, which gave Moore in 1924 its top award for <span style="font-style:italic;">Observations</span>, hosting fifty-three poems (some written after 1921) plus index and notes, while the premature publication had less than half the number. While representative of a concrete, not entirely successful, product of another collaboration, <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> took place on a transferential sphere, with Bryher projecting her own desires to "assist" Moore while shoring up her own psychic investment in modernist poetry and the Dactyl in particular. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Moore asked to read all of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in May 1921, and by July (the same month as the fateful publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>), the poet took it around to various houses. At the same time, Moore undoubtedly felt the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> both rash and generous. She wrote T.S. Eliot that she "felt that it was no literary advantage to publish this work but Miss Bryher had been so optimistic as to disagree" (July 15, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 171); to her brother, she reiterated her preference <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to be published "now that the thing is out as much as I did before" (July 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 170).</p>
<p>Moore began her long letter of July 7, 1921, as a feat in transference itself (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164-7). After laying out her criticisms of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, she explained: "I have pounced on these details for <span style="font-style:italic;">I think it is not good for an artist to be hurried" (SL</span>, 164; emphasis added). Depicting herself as "<span style="font-style:italic;">a pterodactyl with no rock in which to hide</span>", "a Darwinian gosling," "a variety of pigeon that is born naked without any down whatever," Moore expanded upon Bryher's name of her and conveyed her dismayed vulnerability: "I wouldn't have the poems appear now if I could help it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164; emphasis added). In effect undermining the whole venture, she admitted: "the product is remarkably innocuous." Moore was "very much touched by the beauty of all the printing details" and the "unstinted care" in the "outlay," yet her own compositional care had been foreshortened (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164). Archly, she requested that Bryher give Harriet Monroe notice of "this opus" even though, as she critically observed, nothing had been reprinted from the 1915 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span>. The July letter's introductory paragraph ended with the oblique but telling, "Poor Hilda!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). Seeming to veer away from her hairless condition, she claimed "[t]o turn to more important matters." If <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> was meant as a kind of "auxiliary ego-ideal," on Bryher's side, to consolidate her relationship to Moore, the edition was mirrored back as a less than ideal version of how Moore perceived her progeny. With the sense that a book functions as an extension of a self if not an armature, in an aggressive swerve, Moore's letter then noted Macmillan's turning down <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>; the editor, she reported, had "said he was convinced that if the book appeared in its present form it would not be out two months before [Bryher] would regret having published it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). This parry anticipated other defensive strategies—first, a whole paragraph to her first impressions of Hilda and "her bedrock reliability"; and then, in a catalogue of books she has read, her reference to Frank Parson's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Psychology of Dress</span>, underscoring Moore's felt nakedness (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). She elucidated: "[t]he cocoon style with small waist and two or three yards of ruffled train (I explain this, my dear baby dactyl as you would not remember)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166). Bryher had apparently forgotten Moore's desire to be "cocooned" until ready. Moore reveals a "ruffled" sense of being infantilized as "gosling," a process she reverses by dubbing Bryher "baby dactyl" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166).</p>
<p>Indeed the whole letter, traversing multiple subjects, can't get away from its initial image of the naked gosling, unready for flight. The particular jumps and omissions that so invigorate Moore's epistolary style reveal an unsettled yet revealing emotional score. Describing her visit to the Bronx zoo to see "a white snake with pink eyes," she informed: "[I]t eats mice without any fur" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166). There is no transition between her observation that she "think[s] macaws should not be kept in a wire-enclosed field" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and her return to the letter's core subject: "As for Hilda's part in gathering the poems, I am too much in awe to be articulate; I cannot grasp the benevolence and compassing of the whole enterprise and Robert too, is prodigious" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). Indeed, she "cannot grasp" the part played by each collaborative player, though she knew Bryher's money backed the "enterprise." After a series of jumps in subject, her signature laid all bare: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Your now naked</span>, Dactyl" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). In this context, nakedness could only be vexingly pleasurable, yet it evidences the basis of considering Bryher and Moore's relationship as friendship riddled with transference. Her postscript complicated matters: "I should like to be very decent to Miss Weaver (at Egoist Press) but so far have ordered only ten copies. I don't know what to do with these and don't know what to do next" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). The copies are excessive, unwanted "editions," poor reflections of what Moore envisaged; yet Moore understood the flirtatious, generous, and even aggressive intentions motivating Bryher. As if to reinsert herself back into the Dactyl's intimate ground, Bryher's response, to essentially being blamed for going over Moore's head in publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, was to send a cedar bear to add to the poet's menagerie. Moore named it after its giver, "W. Bryher" and reports that "[i]ts inquisitive nose is very affectionately and respectfully received by the other animals and its little dagger teeth and curling tongue tip are a profound source of admiration" (July 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 173). Bryher had also sent one of Robert's letters as another token of confidential connection; the letter, Moore wrote, she would not speak of, and commented: "Also I like his not saying anything when I reproached him for a hasty marriage" (July 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 173).</p>
<p>In August, Moore informed Bryher that she would take the "revised" <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> back to the rejecting Macmillan (August 31, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 178). "I have not read the new version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> as it has just come. But what I should like to do is to take it back to Macmillan. . . . My choice of publishers is as follows: Macmillan, Doran, Knopf, Huebsch. As for commission, no compensation would induce me to take the manuscript anywhere <span style="font-style:italic;">if I did not wish to take it</span> and if I took ten manuscripts a month about for you, I should not feel that you were under any obligation" (August 31, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 179; emphasis added). This letter is signed "albino-dactyl," suggesting some color has been drained from her. Oddly, Moore both expressed her belief in the manuscript and duly reciprocated for the imprudent publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> as well as for Bryher's "hasty" marriage to "Piggy." In her report in November 1921, Doran rejected <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and so the devoted Moore "took it at once to Knopf" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 181).</p>
<p>In another turn of the screw, Harriet Monroe quoted Bryher in a review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems; "[Poems</span>] is the study of a Marco Polo detained at home. It is the fretting of a wish against wish . . ."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> In the context of their prior correspondence, Bryher sounds a bit like a spurned lover. Her highest compliment of this "triumphant book" makes Moore a masculine woman, setting her outside the Genteel school: "The spirit is robust, that of a man with facts and countries to discover and not that of a woman at tapestries. But something has come between the free spirit and its desire" . (This echoes a line in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, which Moore had already seen: "Anne sat back in her chair, a Marco Polo stayed at home, twisted to silence by some strange repression"; 37). Clearly, personal feeling has come between the critic's perception and Moore's work, given her role in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the publication. It is as if Moore's development was, in Bryher's mind, still repressed and sidetracked from adventures.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Burying the Bones: 1922-1923</h1>
<p>It is striking that Bryher offered Moore a "writing fellowship" in 1921 and 1922 so that the latter could travel—apparently with her—to distant parts; what is more striking is the manner in which Moore refused it. The pair would continue to read each other's work and help where possible, so that in the "cooling off" period of this literary infatuation, Moore once more assured Bryher: "I am indeed glad to take care of ADVENTURE" (April 25, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). Bryher would send Moore multiple gifts, and as she did for others, very often with an extremely sensitive eye for the actual desires of the recipient. In March, she sent Moore "collars," a classic garment in Moore's outfits (recall the line from <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: "[h]er austere boyish head, her flushed face about the prim white collar was vivid with excitement.") Here is how Moore responded, after informing Bryher she was then wearing one of the collars given her: "You are very indomitable in your vicarious collecting of choice possessions. Mother says <span style="font-style:italic;">I bury every bone beyond recovery</span>; these I shall keep above ground. I have had such pleasure in wearing the collar and it gratifies me to have your gift admired over and over" (June 13, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>; emphasis added). A collar is of course a resonant item, suggestive of submission. But does her poignant response suggest that Moore hides most all her love objects—all the "bones" she has savored, and most of the love offerings that have given her pleasure?</p>
<p>She returned the writing scholarship, as I said, even as she appreciated the evidence it bestowed. The money put Bryher's affection into intelligibility. Moore began her letter of June 26 with acknowledgment of what Bryher "gave as a sort of guarantee of leisure for writing"; she then asked the benefactor to find a more suitable recipient:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[the fund] ought to be used by someone who would justify your application of it and from your letters I know that you constantly come upon such artists. My processes are inherently different from the usual ones. Traveling hinders my work and doesn't help it; nevertheless I want to take the trip west that we are just starting on. [. . .] Therefore I have transferred the three hundred dollars to you, opening an account in your name in the bank where it has been since you gave it to me. They will send you a pass book and card for your signature, and while you may be for the moment deeply disappointed [. . .] you will have large consolation in the fact that the possession of it has been a true enrichment to me; <span style="font-style:italic;">without its actuality, I could not have known so well as I do, the strength of your friendship, its solidity and dependability</span>.</p>
<div class="attrib">(June 26, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This act of setting up a bank account for a wealthy woman announced Moore's piquant ethics and desire to read affection apart from money, even if it was ratified by it. Moore and her mother left for Seattle July 3 to visit "Badger" who was then stationed as a Navy Chaplain nearby, and where the poet would write her great "Octopus," inspired by Mt. Rainier<span style="font-weight:bold;">.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></span> Traveling to Seattle was Moore's escape hatch (to some extent) from Bryher's intense imprecations; she did, however, correspond with Bryher during this <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  period, once to reinforce that she did not usually mix travel with writing, and another to praise the release of Bryher's <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span> , poems with traces of Bryher's passion for both H.D. and Moore.</p>
<p>To further bolster Moore's rejection of Bryher's "fund," Mary Warner Moore wrote her daughter's admirer while in Seattle<span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> "Is it not a reasonable thing for her to put back your keeping the beautiful 'scholarship' you conferred that memorable New York visit?" She adds of the projected "Syrian trip": "I wish that I had youth and health to throw myself into the breach to do for you just what I should so gladly do for Marianne, were she wishing to take the trip you are to take—that is, were you and she taking it together. But Marianne herself has no facility in that sort of forging forward—" (July 24, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). The same infantilizing letter underscored that Bryher should not make "Marianne [her] personal conductor" and that "secretary work is back breaking" (this in reply to Bryher's off-hand somewhat absurd attempt to "employ" Moore if she could not get her to travel otherwise) and "hard for one so frail," concluding that Moore's job at the library with its four and half hour shift was "enough." Moore's mother acted as conductress here, blocking Bryher's manifold plots to have the Dactyl near her. These plots were foiled, yet the monetary layer in Bryher's courtship reflected (as it deflected) the erotic longing present in the pair's aesthetic exchange. Not every bone was buried without recovery.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>In the same time frame of Bryher's intense entrancement with Moore between late 1920 and 1921 (underscored in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and their correspondence), Bryher hoped matrimony would grant her the respectability she needed to go on with her queer ménage with H.D. and Perdita, giving her freedom from parental domination. Unhappily, she and McAlmon were treated poorly by the press, which reduced him to a fortune hunter, hanging on to Bryher as masculine benefactor traveling with a "wife" (H.D.), who had an illegitimate child and who was estranged from her husband. Even if she might have taken the marriage as a semi-affront considering the coincident courtship unfolding between herself and Bryher, none of the "queerness" of such an arrangement would have been lost on Moore. Moore's "Marriage" of 1923 reflects this, given that Bryher red as the provocative Eve ("so handsome /she gave me a start"). The poem appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Manikin</span>, a journal brought out by Monroe Wheeler, who lived with Glenway Wescott in a "domestic" relationship. According to Moore, they were "able to maintain a relationship true to the spirit of marriage without the benefit of social contract" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 464). Further placing her within the fabric of the age of inversion, Moore (as Willis points out) drew upon Ellis's <span style="font-style:italic;">On Life and Sex</span> in her depiction of marriage as "Crusade" both in letters to Bryher and H.D., and then in her poem "Marriage." (Again, as with <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, fact and fiction blur.)</p>
<p>Moreover, Moore wrote Bryher in 1922 with usual equivocation: "I like Havelock Ellis so much that I am perhaps too eager to find something new in what he writes . . . " Moore's associative eagerness is both occluding and revealing; in reading Ellis' <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  injunction "to persevere," she thought of Trollope: "'for love that will gaze an eagle blind, that is a Hercules still climbing the trees in the garden of the Hesperides, forty-five to seventy is the best age. Up to that time men are merely flirting,' but perhaps that makes some seem willing to tease and I don't mean to be flippant" (March 22, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). Is she suggesting here—or rather confessing—her own teasing disposition towards Bryher and affirming her commitment to bachelorhood? The quote from Trollope reappeared in "Marriage," thus situating Ellis as a mediating strand within Moore's inverted relationship to Bryher (with the respectable Trollope as screen). She thereby reasserted her defense of "merely flirting." Further, Moore was not naïve about lesbian pairings: Moore recommended, for instance, Stein's "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene," and in the same letter of 1923, expressed envy of Man Ray's photo of Bryher (to Bryher, July 5, 1923; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 200-1). She was also not naïve about her choice <span style="font-style:italic;">not to marry</span>. However muted, she made several things clear: she had been flirting, she had been disappointed in Bryher's marriage, and she was a bachelor who had temporarily entertained the overtures of the butch shipping heiress. The strong erotic undertones in her letters to Bryher were finally abstracted in the poem "Marriage."</p>
</div>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>In this period, both Bryher and Moore (alone and together) crystallized and joined aesthetic with erotic goals; they reflected upon geographic and familial identity; they worried about publication as it hinged upon gender. <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> itself commemorated Bryher's arc of arriving in America, meeting Moore, touring the country and then reuniting with the poet. Strikingly, Bryher would later repudiate <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> turned <span style="font-style:italic;">West</span> in 1925 (as if incorporating Moore's criticism of it as hurried, and then burying it); indeed, the book comes early in Bryher's writing career, yet the novel/memoir lucidly portrays Bryher taking Moore into her modernist imaginary and vice versa.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> At the same time, Bryher's relationship to Moore is an exercise in literary collaboration as transference.</p>
<p>The publication relationship presented in this article is a detail in a much larger cultural mosaic of Bryher's life as "female husband" to modernism; she is a kind of female Pound, considering her multilingual internationalism and multiple acts of shepherding other artists (other than H.D., Moore was the first "official" writer to whom Bryher offered a writing fund). When Pound visited H.D. in 1920 and found Bryher alone in their apartment, he pronounced her quite dull; she shared the same view of him. Moore recounted to her brother about Bryher's meeting Ezra: "Bryher said, 'I let him in; I thought it was the bread or the potatoes and I was very sorry I had. He talked to me an hour about a Saxon king and a Danish chief and <span style="font-style:italic;">how one wanted to carry off the other's wife</span> and things went on till but one was left. He said afterward I didn't stand up very well without H.D'" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143; emphasis added). Pound's anecdote about the exchange of wives signals the patriarchal control artists like H.D., Moore and Bryher faced. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In November 1921, Moore wrote to H.D. and Bryher jointly regarding a review in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>, comparing herself to Edna St. Vincent Millay and Anna Wickham as women who "'contracted marriages with wit'" (as though contracting an illness) and "committed themselves to careers of brains"; "'Moore,' the critic continued, 'one admits right away, must best be taken for worse. She wedded wit, but after divorces from beauty and sense'" (to Hilda and Bryher, November 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 181-2). Moore's quotation from the review raises prominent questions about marriage and divorce in the modernist period. Unlike H.D. or Bryher who married for diverse reasons, Moore herself never married and lived with her mother after college as a kind of "couple" until Mary Warner Moore died in 1947. However, Moore was aroused by Bryher, and participated in a flirtatious attachment to the self-described "girl-page," a scenario that somewhat explains Moore's excessive disappointment in Bryher's marriage as well as her protective response—she worried that "it was an outrage for anyone to marry Winifred Bryher in such a style so unromantic" (to John Warner Moore, April 4, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 152). Moore saw through the compulsory convenience of the marriage, but probably could not fully sympathize with Bryher's capitulation to the "heterosexual/homosexual binary." The invocation of "marriages with wit" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> review also suggests the way women writers, alone or unmarried, (or as Leavell frames it in Moore's case, celibate or committed to a mother/daughter relationship), are held accountable along the axis of heterosexual romance.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that collaboration as a form of transference needs further refinement in cases where women (or men) do not fit within expected relationships; there are many degrees of affective and intellectual kinships forged where contracts are not available (nor even desirable) for solidifying them. In the case of Bryher and Moore, the literal encounters between them were brief, but their relationship was long and significant, layered and nautilus-like: they steadily corresponded, commented upon each other's writing, and wrote about each other (Moore wrote reviews of Bryher's novels in the 1950s and 1960s). By the late 1920s, Moore would accept a steady allowance (what Bryher referred to as "covenant") which kept Moore and her mother afloat through the Great Depression and beyond, up to Moore's death in 1972. Bryher also continued to send gifts, a stream of mad money for broaches, clothing, and other artifacts that caught Moore's eye. As further evidence of exchange, Bryher published Moore in her cinema journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> (the poet reviewed, among other things, the lesbian 1930 cult classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">Maedchen in Uniform</span>); Bryher would continue to take tips from Moore about films, discuss politics and mutual friends, visit her when in New York, but 1920-1923 remains the apex of their romantic collaboration.</p>
<p>The very concept of collaboration as transference I conclude demands refashioning to accommodate Bryher's modernist circle, of which Moore was central. Georgina Taylor has posited an "intersubjective" counter-public sphere that flourished among women modernists between 1913 and 1946 (with H.D. at the center) where "new ideas emerged through a process of interaction" primarily through the little magazines.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Yet I suggest that even when "intersubjectivity" enters the question of collaboration, the homo-emotional and/or erotic dimension often goes missing, especially in cases like <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Bryher's—who often passes as only patron, rather than full-fledged collaborator; and in cases like Moore's—who is often dubbed asexual, with her poems fulfilling the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> reviewer's implication that she suffers from lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">real</span> conjugal union.</p>
<p>Bryher's transference with Moore reads like an attempt to act out an earlier self when being a boy seemed possible—a facsimile of frustrated longing she was still in the process of re-creating when she met Moore, who could allow her to act out her own male enterprising, testing the waters of her ability to express desire and take masculine roles outside her family. According to Schafer, the analyst in a transference scenario provides the "[c]ondition of the convincing, sustained readiness of those who are loved to contain one's more or less projective assaults on them, to tolerate the role of bad breast or phallus, arbitrary authority or violation of some other kind, and to endure being abandoned" ("Conditions for Loving," 408). Further, "having met this condition for loving, the analyst [again Moore and Bryher take turns in my case] is loved gratefully as a good mother, father, breast, womb, phallus, friend, and analyst. Not all at once, of course, and not once and for all, and not altogether, for this is only part of the work" ("Conditions for Loving," 408). Ambivalence and doubt are key to the work of transference, and in my mind, also to collaboration, where the old and new become "blurred, and "meaning is multifaceted"; we enter a territory where "one has found and accepted a new mode of experiencing one's self and one's world, which is to say, asserting a transformation to one's own subjectivity" ("Conditions for Loving," 409, 415).</p>
<p>Building upon Freud's notion of creating a new "edition" of the self, transformation takes place, according to Schafer, through the "psychology of metaphor," where some experiences can only be expressed metaphorically. In poems as in collaborative transference, "[m]etaphor is a new experience rather than a mere paraphrase of an already fully constituted experience. The metaphor creates an experience that one has never had before. It is an experience one has not realized by oneself. . . . it is a creation rather than a mere paraphrase or new edition" ("Conditions for Loving," 415). Metaphor—in the exchange between Bryher and Moore—was loaded: Bryher becomes Moore's publisher, her father, her rescuer, her child, her super-ego, her comrade, her usurper, even her seducer (and vice versa), across the course of their most intense interactions. Moore is Pterodactyl of the fish age, and Bryher is overweening adventurer who needs reining in; later, Moore's "edition" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, turns into an assault that tests the limits of love, which appears to survive, even while the tenor of it necessarily changed. For Bryher and Moore, money and gifts became metaphoric monikers of personal and poetic value: can money transcend value of self or creativity? Can one "take" a gift without shame? Can one give it without shame? Can Bryher give it as a means of identification with her powerful shipping magnate father, and then transform this identity within the context of Moore's measures and gratitude? Can one gain purchase over the intangibles of an erotic connection, amidst the swirl of indeterminate nomenclature of female bachelors, of inverts, of queers? Transference, as I redefine it, is a kind of collaboration where "reference" travels between selves, and is not confined to a single text or "edition." In this essay's close up of Bryher's early "coercion" and urging of Moore, her writing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and wanting to have it too, along with Moore's little-known promotion of the book, begin to elucidate the projections, introjections and subtle intimacies of modernist collaboration as transference.</p>

As to Bryher's primary role in the journals she engineered and edited, she did participate in her own erasure by making sure others received more credit: in the instance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, she gave Macpherson centrality, though creating the first film journal in English was certainly the brain-child of <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> Bryher and Macpherson; with <span style="font-style:italic;">Life &amp; Letters</span>, she occluded herself almost entirely, although Moore, for instance, herself wrote the emerging poet Elizabeth Bishop to send her manuscripts directly to Mrs. Macpherson (September 8, 1935; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 353). The editor in chief of <span style="font-style:italic;">Life &amp; Letters</span>, appointed by Bryher, was Robert Herring, and he certainly deserves much credit; at the same time, Bryher asked her name not to be on the masthead although she worked closely with Herring in his selections.</p></div>

Thus, Bryher's relationships must be considered in light of her own sense of the overwhelming cultural significance of psychoanalysis. H.D. had certainly read Freud before meeting Bryher; likewise, Bryher knew Freud's work well before meeting Moore. Moore, on the other hand, didn't have any great faith in psychoanalysis. Still the language of projection, transference, and the incipient field of object relations, inspired by Freud and expanded through James Strachey and Anna Freud up to contemporary theorists like Jessica Benjamin, are useful in thinking about Moore and her modernist circle.</p></div>

<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>Five years ago, reading in the E. M. Forster papers in the King's College Archive Centre at Cambridge, I came across a scrap of manuscript from the late 1950s, composed when the British novelist was almost eighty. The catalogue title was "Notes on the Future of Civilisation."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Even in old age Forster remained a notably public re, commenting on nuclear proliferation, British policy toward India, post-war suburban planning, and the role of the arts in society. Until 1959 he reviewed books for the BBC magazine the <span style="font-style:italic;">Listener</span>, where his close friend J. R. Ackerley served as literary editor. So when I opened the manuscript, I did not expect Forster's thoughts on the future of civilization to concern Liberace. But here was the American showman, described in Forster's spidery hand—Liberace and his "horrid" piano. Forster described "[f]emale teenagers" touching Liberace's clothes "as if they were the hem of the garments of Christ. Take care they don't tear you to pieces."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The old man was clearly fascinated and repelled by the pianist, who first played concerts in Britain in the summer of 1956.</p>
<p>Until I saw them on the page together, Forster and Liberace seemed to occupy wholly separate conceptual spaces. Forster, the Edwardian, the buttoned-up Englishman, published his last novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Passage to India</span> in 1924, when Liberace was just five. Wladziu Valentino Liberace, the self-styled "simple boy from Milwaukee," by this time had perfected his extravagant <span style="font-style:italic;">persona</span>—the white fur coat over the dazzling, rhinestone-encrusted white tie and tails, the towering candelabrum as a camp homage to Chopin, and the swimming pool in the shape of a grand piano.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> But here were their lives momentarily intertwined. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The thread of this queer narrative led me to the discovery of a political turn in Forster's private life. Forster collected a vast archive of his gay life, which he hid with exquisite caution, recorded with exacting precision, and deliberately preserved for gay posterity. There is no record that the two men ever met. But the Liberace allusion in Forster's private musing opens a new chapter in Forster's long, queer, modern life. For Liberace was legible to Forster and his friends. And Liberace's actions offered a concrete vision of "the future of civilisation" for these gay men.</p>
<p>Everything about Liberace's first international tour was designed to magnify his celebrity. Already a fixture on BBC television, he played Paris and Monaco; with his mother and brother, he attended a special audience with Pope Pius XII at the Vatican. He sailed to England aboard the luxurious Queen Mary and commissioned his own private train—"The Liberace Special"—to transport him from Southampton to Waterloo station. He drew fans from all social classes—selling out the Royal Albert Hall, the huge vaudeville-palace of the Palladium, and elegant supper clubs. Everywhere he faced a melee of fans. The Metropolitan Police had to lay on a whole separate squad for his protection. The music critics were less awful than one might expect. Despite the "circus-turn and the fancy-dress parade," some reviewers had to admit that Liberace had mastered a florid version of the Romantic repertoire (<span style="font-style:italic;">LAA</span>, 193, 190).</p>
<p>In coming to England Liberace appeared to be recapitulating the successful ascendency to stardom he had begun in the United States. But the tour was a deliberate escape, designed to distract from a welter of accusations that the thirty-nine-year-old entertainer was not only homosexual, but also a predatory seducer of young straight men. A series of tabloid stories suggesting he was "Mad about the Boy" and the failure of his first film had cut into his ticket sales.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Forster could have told Liberace that post-war London was not the refuge he imagined it might be. For gay men, the Blitz had been a time of remarkable freedom—paradoxically, despite the heightened atmosphere of security, so much could be hidden in a blackout. Forster, and many of his friends—who were a generation younger—cruised the streets of the city. Then, in the immortal words of Quentin Crisp, "Peace broke out."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>By the early 1950s, the British government began a crackdown on sexual license. The tabloids echoed the lament of Viscount Samuel in the House of Lords, who decried the "insidious poisoning" of Britain's "moral state," complaining "the vices of Sodom and Gomorrah, of the Cities of the Plain, appear to be rife among us."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> To curb this scourge, police <span style="font-style:italic;">agents-provocateurs</span> were sent out to entrap homosexuals through solicitation; a special division of the Metropolitan Police was formed solely to patrol public urinals. The number of prosecutions for homosexual offenses skyrocketed.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The press fanned this moral crusade in tones both salacious and indignant. Powerful and famous men were paraded as examples, including the recently knighted actor Sir John Gielgud and a Labour MP, who were arrested for cottaging. In the sensational Montagu case, three prominent men—including a young peer and the chief diplomatic correspondent for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span>—were charged with conspiring to commit indecency; the timing of the arrests was orchestrated by the police so the story could <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  appear prominently on the front pages of the Sunday newspapers.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Newspapers were in a race to outdo each other in reporting on sex while spinning out contradictory stereotypes about sexual criminals with increasing certainty and fervor. In May of 1952 the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Pictorial</span> devoted a full-page feature to ways to recognize these "Evil Men"; nine years later it helpfully explained "How to Spot a Homo."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Readers could discern a homosexual by his sedate tweed jacket, suede shoes, and pipe, or alternately by his telltale effeminate manner and mincing step. These "exposés" reflected the anxieties born of the paradox that homosexuals, forced to live a double life, proved to be quite successful at it.</p>
<p>Forster was one of those men. He was sixteen in 1895 when Oscar Wilde was sent to prison for gross indecency. All his life he had lived cautiously as a closeted homosexual. In his old age Forster began to rethink this posture. He wrote a friend "The older one grows, the less one values secrecy perhaps, anyhow there is very little of me that I feel worthwhile to lock up."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Now, 60 years after Wilde's conviction, Forster sent a copy of a letter he had published asking for "less social stigma" towards homosexuals to Lord Samuel, as a kind of catnip. The Viscount took the bait. "Incomprehensible and utterly disgusting as [homosexuality] appears to all normal people," Lord Samuel replied to Forster, "it seems to have the capacity to form a habit as potent as alcohol or narcotics."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The law that was used to convict Wilde was still on the books when Liberace arrived in London.</p>
<p>Enter <span style="font-style:italic;">Cassandra</span>—in this case the dire penname of William Connor, a gossip columnist for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span>. The frenzied fan-worship drew Cassandra's ire. The day after Liberace arrived in London, before he had played even a single concert, Connor diagnosed a cultural malady in tones of hysterical invective. He was "appalled" and "terrified":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[Liberace] is the summit of sex—Masculine, Feminine and Neuter. Everything that He, She and It can ever want. . . . This deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated, scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love has had the biggest reception and impact on London since Charlie Chaplin arrived . . . There must be something wrong with us that our teenagers longing for sex and our middle-aged matrons fed up with sex alike should fall for such a sugary mountain of jingling claptrap wrapped up in such a preposterous clown.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Reading these words, Liberace construed that he was being accused of effeminacy and homosexuality. He rightly concluded that the stigma would threaten his career. "He, She and It"—he later said—"was the passage that decided me to sue. That was the one I was afraid would haunt me all my life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LAA</span>, 226). Like Oscar Wilde, Liberace brought a civil case of libel. It would be three years before the case came to trial, in the summer of 1959.</p>
<p>A counter-narrative about the relation between sexual attitudes and the future of civilization was developing, at first in private, in Britain during these years. On the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 1954, the Home Office appointed a committee of clergy, peers, and respectable academics to investigate the twin problems of female prostitution and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  male homosexuality. This became the Wolfenden Committee, named after the educator Sir John Wolfenden, which would recommend three years later that "homosexual activity between consenting adults over the age of twenty-one in private be no longer a criminal offense."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> It took almost another decade to enact these recommendations into law, and even then the statute was "mild and aetiolated."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Even in the mid-1960s, the vaunted milestone in homosexual rights was largely symbolic.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>It is not customary to see Forster as a champion of gay rights, but the archives reveal that during this period he made several feints in the direction of public advocacy. During the committee's deliberations, Forster had a quiet, and heretofore unrecorded, luncheon with Sir John Wolfenden, during which he outed himself. Forster came away impressed, but not sanguine about the prospect of true reform. He composed a letter (published under a friend's signature) protesting a horrifying case in Abergavenny, Wales; a gay sting, which sent eighteen men to prison for twelve years—one attempted suicide, and a nineteen-year-old walked in front of a train.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Later, Forster published a letter in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> protesting the treatment of a gay seventeen-year-old boy from Consett, Durham who, denied bail though his family had raised the money, committed suicide as he awaited trial.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Forster also donated £500, a huge sum, to the Homosexual Law Reform Society, dryly noting in his diary that he did not expect to see much return on his investment.</p>
<p>Sometimes the police crackdowns came very close to home. His close friend Mattei Radev was arrested for cottaging, and Forster contemplated testifying on his behalf and outing himself. A second scare came on the heels of the first, when a police raid on a Soho club (fetchingly named the "Mousehole") caused J. R. Ackerley to caution Forster against frequenting it until the scandal blew over.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Indignant about the "Mousehole" raid, Forster persuaded Ackerley to write a letter in protest, cagily appropriating a neutral subject position:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Be frisky, but not 'we homosexuals' nor so much about yourself, lest it humourlessly be brought against you. 'I have occasionally drawn a cup of coffee at the Mousehole myself little knowing of my peril, or that a policeman might be observing me and might demand my name and address because my taste in clothes differed from his'—is about the level.</p>
<div class="attrib">(Letter to J.R. Ackerly [circa January 1958])<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Liberace's trial in the summer of 1959 was front-page news. For two weeks in June the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>, to which Forster subscribed, reprinted column upon column of verbatim testimony. In the courtroom Liberace almost appeared to be following Forster's advice, disguised as the comically understated version of a "normal" man. Setting aside the white tails and rhinestones for a grey flannel suit, Liberace testified that Cassandra's words had attacked his manhood, made his mother ill, and "cost me many years of my professional career by implying that I am a homosexual. . . . It has caused untold agonies . . . and made me the subject of ridicule" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LAA</span>, 228). On direct examination Liberace lied, as Wilde had done, saying he was not homosexual, nor had engaged in homosexual practices. He persuasively wrapped himself in the mantle of family values. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  He testified that, "My feelings [about homosexuality] are the same as anybody else's. I am against the practice because it offends convention and offends society."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Liberace's case depended on the very cultural ideology about masculinity that the tabloids had reinforced in their endless articles on "gay-watching." Occasionally, reliance on these unexamined assumptions had the unintentional effect of queering every aspect of upper-class Britain. Sir Gilbert Beyfus, QC for Liberace's case, argued at the outset that Liberace's "elaborate wardrobe of what may be called fancy-dress" did not signify anything about the performer's masculinity:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Before we jeer at the American public for enjoying this added glamour or at Liberace for acceding to it, it is well to remember that less than 150 years ago, in the Regency period, our men dressed up and one of the greatest arts was that of tying a necktie. In these days of somewhat drab and dreary male clothing, remember the guards at Buckingham Palace, the Horse Guards in Whitehall, the Beefeaters at the Tower, the uniforms of the Privy Councillors at a Levée, Knights of the Garter and Peers of the Realm at the opening of Parliament. Look at the hunt ball when tough hunting men prance around in pink coats with silk lapels of different colours. Some add dignity, all add glamour.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">He continued, importuning Mr. Justice Salmon to</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Look at me, my Lord, and my learned friends, dressed in accordance with old traditions, which lends dignity to our proceedings. Because we dress like this here, it does not mean we dress like this in our ordinary daily life, nor does Liberace.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Indeed, Ackerley and his friends had made quite a study of "remembering the guards at Whitehall," regaling Forster with stories of cruising handsome young men in uniform. Archives from Texas to the north of England contain colorful correspondence in a camp vein. Forster himself found this sort of humor infectious, once remarking that he had caught the poet William Plomer in an "unguardeed moment."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>As with the Wilde trials—or the Monica Lewinsky affair, for that matter—the trial afforded a public venue for the discussion of sexual matters that were usually not mentioned in public. On the stand Liberace managed his testimony carefully, conveying the "intimacy" of his concert performances onto a new stage. He spoke the offending words plainly, and professed to be standing up for his fans in pressing the libel suit. "At Sheffield when he went on the stage," the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> reported, "there were cries from the audience. They seemed to come from the gallery and were 'Queer' and 'Fairy' and such things as 'Go home, queer.'" Beyfus inquired if these taunts upset Liberace. The pianist replied "Very much, sir; and it upset the audience, too, because I would say a good many people in the audience were embarrassed at hearing these comments."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> He proclaimed that "I have tried in all my performances to inject a note of sincerity and wholesomeness because I am fully aware of the fact that my appeal on television and personal appearances is aimed directly at the family audiences."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The jury of ten men and two women determined that the pianist had reason to believe that Cassandra's words implied he was a homosexual, and reason to fear they <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  would harm his career. They awarded him the largest libel verdict to date, £8,000, the equivalent of about a quarter of a million dollars in 2010 currency. Afterward, Liberace remarked that he had "laughed all the way to the bank."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>When Forster was a young man, it was fashionably scientific to describe homosexuals as "inverts," men whose soul was effeminate, and whose sexual identity was a distorted reflection of real masculinity.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Forster never accepted the term, coining the neologism "minority" to describe his sexual identity in his unpublished diary.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In one sense these intertwined narrative threads—Forster's private story and Liberace's public one—are both tales of inverts, of men forced to camouflage and dissemble, to divide and deny because of their sexual identity. But to gay men in the 1950s, Liberace's trial was a thrilling inversion of Wilde's famous trial. Both Wilde and Liberace were anarchic res who poked fun at, and deployed, bourgeois values to magnify their celebrity. Both were iconically recognizable by their habits of dress. Both were extremely funny and playful. Both used, or attempted to use, the public attention of the Justice system to make a personal case about the power of words to destroy a gay man's career.</p>
<p>But Liberace won the day. The verdict offered an outcome more satisfying than mere reform, revenge. Of course it is not possible to view Liberace's trial as an unalloyed blow for sexual justice. To win the case the great showman had to domesticate his image, mouthing platitudes of self-loathing. But the very cheerfulness of his victory had a salutary appeal. He was not crushed by the encounter with the Justice system, as Wilde had been. Liberace's victorious lawsuit against the "implication that I am homosexual" rewrote the story of Oscar Wilde's trials—the traumatic minatory lesson of Forster's teenage years.</p>
<p>There is no direct evidence of Forster's reaction to the trial. But the very existence of this scrap led me into the wonderland of this complex cultural moment of post-war sexual liberations, and alerted me to Forster's advocacy. We think of queer lives as trafficking in hyperbole, but my experience researching my new biography of Forster has shown the opposite. Again and again a tiny shard of evidence leads to a complex subterranean story.</p>
<p>Both Cassandra and Forster sensed an anarchic power in Liberace's story, a struggle for "the future of civilization." Forster was suspicious of the very idea <span style="font-style:italic;">of civilization</span>, or rather of what he called "the brassy rattle of civilisation so-called." Fifty years earlier, he had written a letter to his friend Florence Barger, celebrating a love affair with an Egyptian man. He thanked her for understanding that this first fully-realized love was as legitimate as heterosexual love stories:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I imagine it is indeed worthy to be thought about; it is such a triumph over nonsense and artificial difficulties: it is a sample of the . . . other triumphs that I am sure come off but of which we hear nothing through the brassy rattle of civilisation so called. . . . When I am with him smoking or talking quietly ahead . . . I see beyond my own happiness and intimacy, occasional glimpses of the happiness of 1000s of others whose names I shall never hear, and I know that there is a great unrecorded history.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p>Forster most likely recognized Liberace's rewriting of Wilde's unhappy ending as part of a new counter-narrative. Just about the time of the Liberace trials, he began to revise his long-suppressed <span style="font-style:italic;">Maurice</span> manuscript, drafting an explicit love scene between Maurice and Alec. He began to plan for its posthumous publication, its entrance into a counter-canon. But Forster was also deeply aware that oppression of homosexuals was an ineluctable note of "civilization's brassy rattle." As the Wolfenden Report languished and no law was forthcoming, he composed a "Terminal Note" to the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Maurice</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Homosexuality</p>
<p>Note in conclusion on a word hitherto unmentioned. Since <span style="font-style:italic;">Maurice</span> was written there has been a change in the public attitude here: the change from ignorance and terror to familiarity and contempt. It is not the change towards which Edward Carpenter had worked. . . . And I . . . less optimistic, had supposed that knowledge would bring understanding. We had not realised that what the public really loathes in homosexuality is not the thing itself but having to think about it. If it could be slipped into our midst unnoticed, legalised overnight by a decree in small print, there would be few protests. Unfortunately it can only be legalised by Parliament, and Members of Parliament are obliged to think or to appear to think. Consequently the Wolfenden recommendations will be indefinitely rejected, police prosecutions will continue, and Clive on the bench will continue to sentence Alec in the dock. Maurice may get off.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tug of war over the future of civilization did not resolve with the momentary victory of the Liberace trial. But the subversive voices of gay life had a long history too. Forster had read Roger Casement's Black diaries and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses, Lolita</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Giovanni's Room</span>. And just down the street at the local cinema, Elvis Presley, "a handsome boy," sang and danced "most provocatively" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Jailhouse Rock</span>. Joe Ackerley recommended it (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span> 338).</p>

<p>I like wine. Air raids much less.</p>
<div class="attrib">—Virginia Woolf<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter that scholars provisionally date to March 18, 1941, Virginia Woolf explained to her husband Leonard why she was "going mad again." "I begin to hear voices, and cant concentrate," Woolf records: "You see I cant even write this properly. I cant read. What I want to say is that I owe all the happiness of my life to you."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In the intervening days before she took her life on March 28, Woolf sent a copy of her last novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> , to John Lehmann, managing director of Hogarth Press. Despite his enthusiastic praise for the text, Woolf wrote Lehmann on March 27 to declare that she would continue to revise the novel,<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> which she had earlier called "a concentration—a screw" amidst the "many air raids" of World War II and a "concentrated small book" that contained "many varieties of mood" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 311, 114). The next day, Woolf wrote Leonard a note similar to her letter of March 18—omitting the sentence about her inability to "concentrate"—and drowned herself hours later in the River Ouse.</p>
<p>A writer who believed that "to shut out, to concentrate—that is perhaps—one of the necessary conditions [. . .] of genius," <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Woolf knew that retaining her concentration was also, by the time she omitted it from her final letter to Leonard, a necessary condition of survival (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 179). World War II escalated the struggle that Woolf had endured throughout her life to retain such focus: numbered 115 and 116 on Hitler's secret arrest list for England, the Woolfs both planned to kill themselves should Hitler invade England, which seemed increasingly plausible during the Blitz (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 165). Contemplating the alternatives of "we in concentration camps, or taking sleeping draughts," Woolf avowed her intention to do the latter or gas herself in her garage rather than submit to Hitler, for "capitulation will mean all Jews to be given up. Concentration camps. So to our garage" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 292-3). The Nazi concentration camps presented Woolf with two fatal options—taking her own life or having it taken from her—that would eliminate the possibility of concentration altogether.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At the expense of finishing what she otherwise considered to be a "triumphant" novel, however, Woolf did retain through her final days "a concentration" in the "concentrated [. . .] variety of moods" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, a book that critiques the Nazi regime and that provided Woolf focus during the Blitz (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 340). As her use of the word to describe both her personal attention and her novel's aesthetic suggests, concentration was, for Woolf, not only a state of mind in this period but a medium of aesthetic, ethical, and political agency. Her March 18 letter to Leonard establishes such links as it correlates Woolf's personal facility to "concentrate" with her aesthetic abilities to "write" and "read." The goal of this correlation, she says, is to express her belief in and gratitude for intersubjective bonds: "I owe all the happiness of my life to you."</p>
<p>Woolf's concentration thus highlights a central aesthetic and ethical paradigm in her late work, namely the need to overcome the boundaries of the self in order to sympathize with a world of others, what Natania Rosenfeld calls Woolf's "politics of intersubjectivity."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> While her association of the phrases "to concentrate" and "to shut out" might appear to imply just the opposite, Woolf actually concentrates by shutting out the self, specifically the self's socially-constructed identity. Woolf's concentration is as she says "a screw," a binding agent between subject and object made acutely necessary by the war, during which she wrote that "now's the time to see if the art, or life, creed, the belief in something existing independently of myself, will [. . .] hold good" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 264). As a transitive verb, "concentrate" requires such selective focus on others: it denotes the fixation of personal faculties on an object, and it can mean bringing a group of objects together.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> For Woolf, these definitions work simultaneously, for she posits in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> that one must divest oneself of self-identity—threatening but never achieving biological death—in order to create a collectivity that might survive, and in fact prevent, the self-obsessed sources and goals of warfare.</p>
<p>As the force required to screw objects together suggests, however, this ethic troublingly posits that instances of violence by and to the ego yield communal cohesion. Especially in her late work, as Patricia Klindienst Joplin argues, Woolf explores "whether it is possible to constitute an identity, whether as an individual or group, except at the expense of an other."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In her memoir "A Sketch of the Past" , for example, Woolf records how the Blitz reinforced her belief that "nothing is so much to be dreaded as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  egotism. Nothing so cruelly hurts the person himself; nothing so wounds those who are forced into contact with it."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Yet such violence, she had claimed of World War I, can also yield a "whole people [. . .] concentrated on a single point" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 1: 217), a concentration that Woolf calls during WWII "the community feeling: all England thinking this same thing—this horror of war—at the same moment." Horror like war is prerequisite for collective concentration, she writes, lest come "the lull &amp; one lapses again into private separation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 215).</p>
<p>While scholars have examined the politics of community in Woolf's late work—most persuasively as a critique of modernist preoccupations with interiority—they have largely overlooked how Woolf's ethic of self-divestiture hinges on this principle of violence.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Yet this ethic inheres in another denotation of "concentrate": to strengthen through distillation, even purification.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Formally and thematically, Woolf's vision of concentration in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> enacts such violent purification on the model of atavism, or the reversion of biological forms to prior stages of development, an idea popularized in the modernist period by Charles Darwin, whose work Woolf read and wanted to write about during WWII (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 274, 294, 331). Darwin based his theory of descent partially on the evidence of atavistic traits in humans, which he terms "reversions" and "rudiments," the former concept referring to biological structures that reappear during a species' development, the latter referring to obsolete structures that nonetheless endure.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Together, Darwin writes, "reversionary, as well as the strictly rudimentary, structures reveal the descent of man from some lower form in an unmistakeable manner" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 130). In his documentation of "reversions to a savage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 173), Darwin offered one of the most famous violations of anthropocentrism in modern thought. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, Woolf extends this violation to a civilization whose efforts at domination betray, and threaten to destroy, its members' collective "lower form."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Thematically, Woolf creates a concentrated community in this novel by stripping individuals of the pretensions to civilization that constitute individual and national identities alike. Such pretensions structure the novel's premise about a small English village community that gathers in the summer of 1939 at a country estate named Pointz Hall to witness and participate in an annual pageant play meant to celebrate English literary and political history. Woolf stages that play outdoors, however, in a natural setting that vexes the play and causes the audience to realize, as one anonymous character says, "'there's a sense in which we all, I admit, are savages still.'"<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> By atavistically despoiling her characters' individual identities, Woolf concentrates them into an unidentified "we."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> As an anonymous portion of the audience muses, "'It's a good day, some say, the day we are stripped naked. Others, it's the end of the day'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 106). "Living near to the bone" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 328), as Woolf described life during the war, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s characters have no choice about whether to regress: only about whether their submission to that reversion will constitute their civilization's renewal or its death.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Formally, Woolf enacts this distillation through the novel's direct discourse and objective third-person reportage. Both formal traits detach the narrator (when one appears) and the reader from characters' private lives. This narratological detachment, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or stripping away of mediation, explains Woolf's preoccupation with the drama in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, for the novel form is distinguished by narratological mediation, whereas drama typically forgoes mediation and relates character through dialogue and action. Stripping her novel of a mediating "I" (or any consistent narratological voice), Woolf presents a community in the process of self-divestiture. Such techniques led Woolf to claim that she had "got at a more direct method of summarising relations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 200) and found "a new combination of the raw &amp; the lyrical" while writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 259). Through such aesthetic concentration, the novel formalizes its atavistic thematics.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Disturbing even on their own terms, Woolf's aesthetic and ethic of concentration run troublingly close to the eugenic logic practiced in the Nazi concentration camps, which Hitler's regime used in a genocidal campaign initiated before and escalated after Woolf's death.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The Nazis murdered homosexuals, Jews, and other social minorities in an effort to purify the race of degeneracy, a term that arose with evolutionary theory to denote biological forms that were atavistic and/or enervated.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> adumbrates this genocide, as characters read about murders and imprisonment on the continent, discuss Jewish refugees, and fear invasion as they watch threatening planes fly overhead during the pageant (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 32; 84; 131; 135). Depicting her characters in a universal state of degeneration—"all savages"—but proposing that such degeneration is salvific, Woolf parodies eugenic forms of concentration that endorse material destruction, even as she supports a form of concentration that propagates material difference by distilling social identity. With such parody, as the epigraph above suggests, Woolf employs a relentlessly humorous tone throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> that engenders the "variety of moods" that she claimed her "concentrated small book" contained.</p>
<p>A paragraph from the early typescript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> exemplifies this strange concatenation of humor and horror in Woolf's principle of concentration:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>To some, a snatch of poetry, if it were only the rhyme on a tear-off calendar, was as necessary a part of the toilet as any other; they read as they brushed their teeth. But the concentration necessary was unhygienic; they could no more read poetry by the hour—unless stretched in a sand pit or under a tree with a pine needle for marker, dipping and ceasing, dipping and ceasing—than they could do dumbbell exercises or pray. It was a concentration, a pressure upon the mind—poetry—that turned it to diamond. And how could a pressure like that be maintained without injury to the delicate fibres?</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 50)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Framed within a laughable scene of British gentry reading poetry while brushing their teeth, Woolf's description of concentration, with its parodic attention to hygiene, subverts the Nazis' eugenic logic of purification. For Woolf, concentration upon aesthetic matters is "unhygienic" by normative standards: it requires "dipping and ceasing" into atavistic poses "in a sand pit or under a tree"; it demands a focus that exceeds the boundaries of self-care and must incur "injury to the delicate fibres." Yet such violence to civilized identity may be constructive, Woolf implies, for this "pressure upon the mind" transforms the mind into "diamond." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Although she omits this scene from the novel's final—but for her only provisional—iteration, Woolf uses this simultaneously humorous and disturbing logic of concentration throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> to undermine the egotistical self bent on dominating others with its own sense of identity. Epitomizing one of the novel's refrains, "the laughter died away," <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> is riddled with affectively incongruous episodes: reflections on rape inspiring reflections on the weather, a tale of suicide followed by an adult's defending her own immaturity, murder in the name of "a child's game," and a woman (indeed a whole community) who looks "nearly extinct" as she "clapped and laughed loud" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 40, 42, 45, 16, 31, 68, 65). Such episodes themselves riddle the text's long pageant play, a pastiche of English comedies that fails so miserably that its author repeatedly likens it to death (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96, 122).</p>
<p>Scholars have long debated about whether such scenes position <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> within the comedic or the tragic mode, yet I argue that Woolf's aesthetic of concentration distills the tragedy of civilization into a comedy of nature.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Woolf pits the historically subordinate, feminized mode of comedy against the traditionally dominant, masculinized mode of tragedy to create a formal allegory for the novel's feminist politics: as Woolf herself claimed, "when tragedy and comedy collide it is comedy that wins."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Whereas tragedy classically offers a "change of fortune [that] should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Woolf's comedy of nature employs the tragic structure of decline as a good: as a submission and return to a Darwinian understanding of nature as infinitely heterogeneous and transformative, one wherein "species are not immutable" but exist in "infinitely varied diversities."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Distilled to this state of material mutability, <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span> might renounce its civilized claim to a static identity and submit to the remarkably "protean and polymorphic" quality that, Darwin believes, characterizes the human species (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 249).<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> For Woolf, the transformative possibilities inherent in the atavistic human seem promising in an era tragically committed to ideological stasis.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>When Woolf's character Isa requests a "new plot" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, then, a "plot [that] was only there to beget emotion," Woolf provides one in the form of what Dana Seitler terms the modernist "degeneration narrative," which, "rather than resulting in the closure of the conventional heterosexual love plot or adventure novel, results in the regression of an individual to an atavistic state," such that its plot "regresses as it progresses."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Refusing a heterosexual telos, Woolf's degenerative comedy presents a complementary mode to what Michael North calls the 20<sup>th</sup>-century's "machine-age comedy," a historically unprecedented form inspired by that century's innovations in mechanical reproduction, for the post-Darwinian comedy of nature produces difference through a variety of reproductive and non-reproductive means.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> On the evidence of productive forces like the "spontaneous variations of instincts," in fact, Darwin argues that it is "certainly an error" to suppose "that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction" (<span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 245, 32). Whereas the machine's comedy emerges from a confusion between the mechanical and the natural, nature's comedy emerges from their disarticulation: from the disarticulation of any identification, in fact, wherein production could be mistaken for reproduction alone.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, Woolf represents such potentially non-reproductive diversities in a queer social world that arguably realizes the "anonymous and secret Society of Outsiders" that, she envisions in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> , might t fascism pacifically by rejecting nationalist motivations.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The "many variety of moods" that permeate <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s queer world may accordingly be synthesized as <span style="font-style:italic;">camp</span>, an aesthetic whose resistance to definition itself exemplifies the novel's affective indeterminacy.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> In her 1964 essay "Notes on 'Camp,'" nonetheless, Susan Sontag provides some consistent traits of the aesthetic that bear relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>: that camp "is alive to a double sense in which some things can be taken"; that camp "corrupts" and "appreciates vulgarity"; and that "camp and tragedy are antitheses," for camp "proposes a comic vision of the world" and evinces "love for human nature."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Reinforcing Jed Esty's insight that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> "represents a group's wish to avoid collective identity as a positive feature <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> its collective identity," the novel's camp aesthetic corrupts individual and national identities to propose a communal ethic of "human sympathy," of "love for human nature."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In contemporary theoretical accounts of queer experience, however, feelings like camp are characteristically set in opposition to scientific understandings of nature, as is queerness generally. Writes Sontag, "camp objects, and persons, contain a large element of artifice. Nothing in nature can be campy" ("Notes," 55). Upsetting such critical orthodoxies, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> depicts queer feelings like camp as natural on the Darwinian logic that nature itself is queer, or endlessly transformative and defiant of material or conceptual normativity.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In contrast to the green nail polish and mangy fur coat that adorn this period's most famously campy character, Christopher Isherwood's Sally Bowles, the novel offers a distilled version of camp that, with its emphasis on forms of concentration, including biological and cultural atavism, might be called <span style="font-style:italic;">concentrated camp</span>.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> This term encapsulates how Woolf enacts in form precisely the ethic that she propounds in content: she strips an aesthetic typically laden with civilized trappings to its bare material core—the unidentified, feeling body—just as she proposes that European civilization degenerate to a social mode of material interconnection before the artifice of identity takes on such force that it eradicates materiality altogether.</p>
<p>As Steve Lipman and Viktor Frankl record, a related form of humor pervaded the atavistic conditions of the concentration camps themselves, where prisoners "found humor, sometimes sardonic humor, in all aspects of their disrupted existence" as a way to "embrac[e] the wider cycles of life and death" and to reject "false illusions" and "artificial optimism."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Woolf similarly disparaged wartime's artificial feelings: she mourned that "most people are numb &amp; have surface optimism" derived from "the emotional falsity" of "that dreary false cheery hero-making strain" that emerged in German and British war propaganda (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 231, 292). For Woolf, such propaganda sanitized war's horror under the patronizing, and paternalistic, guise of heroism: "I dont like any of the feelings war breeds: patriotism; communal &amp;c, all sentimental &amp; emotional parodies of our real feelings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 302). With her camp aesthetic, Woolf parodies these "emotional parodies" themselves to foil the horror that Nazi propaganda rationalized under the name of health and British propaganda under the name of heroism. Such parodies might, she hoped, shock the wartime community out of its <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  numb optimism and transform Hitler's oppressive concept of "nature as guarantor of unchanging order" on the Darwinian logic that nature is the guarantor of a changing order.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> If camp "refashion[s] as a weapon of attack an oppressive identity inherited <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> subordination," Woolf's concentrated camp refashions nature as guarantor of the chance that queer lives might proliferate beyond eugenic concentration.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>

<div class="attrib">—Donna Haraway, <span style="font-style:italic;">Primate Visions: Gender,</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science</span><sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup>

</blockquote>
<p>As detailed in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, Woolf characteristically described war in gendered terms, viewing fascism as a product of European patriarchy.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> As we will see, Woolf also characteristically described humor as women's best weapon against such forces. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s obscene camp, she expands this feminist politic to the realm of queer aesthetics. In the October 1938 letter in which she announces her first work on the novel, in fact, Woolf claims that she is "going to write a comedy about" the idea "that marriage [. . .] reduces one to a damnable servility."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> By making such reduction humorous, Woolf aims, as Christine Froula argues, "to form a radical public to whom women artists, like Joyce and Proust, can 'say everything,'" including, as Rebecca Walkowitz aptly puts it, that "one must risk being bad—uncertain, inconsistent, unsuccessful—in order to keep being good."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Woolf's attempt to be good with bad aesthetics—a definition of camp itself—is cause to reassess what some have deemed her pacifism and passivity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> As Pamela Robertson argues in her unprecedented analysis of female camp, "camp offers a slightly different model of negotiation to account for the overlap between passivity and activity in a viewer who sees through, simultaneously perhaps, one mask of serious femininity and another mask of laughing femininity."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In a position of active passivity, Woolf's characters present a frighteningly comedic response to war: submitting to degradation, not just to martial violence but to natural violence, including the queerly sadomasochistic pleasures of sex. Such sexual submission, Leo Bersani writes, offers "the terrifying appeal of a loss of the ego, of a self-debasement" that, by shattering the ego's "sacrosanct value of selfhood," may also prevent "sexuality [from] becoming a struggle for power."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, this degradation emerges through evolutionary tropes of atavism that derive from Darwin's theories of natural selection and variation in, among other texts, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origin of Species</span> (1859; 1872), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</span> , and the first volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span> . Woolf offers these atavistic tropes in earnest; the parodic element <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of her evolutionary art derives from Darwin's misogynist renderings of sexual selection in the second volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>. Claims like the following, for example, have long made the idea of a Darwinian feminism seem like a contradiction in terms:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Man is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage state he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the male of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should gain the power of selection. Women are everywhere conscious of the value of their beauty; and when they have the means, they take more delight in decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments than do men.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 371-2)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Whereas most of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>'s second volume details how sexual selection works on the logic that females are attracted to their more beautiful male counterparts (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 78), Darwin reserves this reductive characterization of beauty-conscious females for the human species, perhaps under the pressure of Victorian gender standards. Regardless of his motivations, Darwin makes beauty, rather than any other aesthetic state, the paradigm of sexual reproduction amongst all species, and he depicts all females in the thrall of males, whether to their beauty or their power. For <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span>, Darwin's alarming conclusion from these explorations is that "man has ultimately become superior to woman" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 328)—a conclusion upon which Hitler seizes in his eugenic practices.</p>
<p>In his rhetoric against degeneration, which Woolf followed assiduously on the BBC and in newspapers (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 5: 245, 263), Hitler declares war against the unsanitized and degenerate on the Darwinian logic that, as he writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span> (1925-6), "every historical event in the world is nothing more nor less than a manifestation of the instinct of racial self-preservation."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Within the eugenic programs that he endorsed to eliminate degeneracy, programs including forced sterilization and state-run marriages, Hitler aimed to prevent women from working and to subjugate them into maternal roles, for every girl, he averred, "is one day to be a mother" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 376). Coupled with his attempt to eliminate homosexuals, whom he considered as "infectious and as dangerous as the plague," Hitler's campaign against non-reproductive women attempted to institutionalize reproductivity as the only natural state of sexual being.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>True to his pseudo-Darwinian rhetoric, Hitler calls upon "Nature" to justify his eugenic programs, citing it as a model of "selective breeding" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 39). While Darwin does flirt with eugenic ideals at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>'s second volume, he more consistently holds that nature is not a selective breeder but a random collection of "dimly understood laws of variation [that] are infinitely complex and diversified" and whose "number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 403; <span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 34). Natural selection cannot work in states of homogeneity, Darwin writes, for "the possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability," such that "close interbreeding, by lessening [species'] vigour and fertility, aids in their final extinction."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Deploying Darwin's invariant theory of sexual selection to the point of obfuscating his theories of natural selection and variability, Hitler perverts evolutionary theory to legislate its laws, especially the laws of sexual nature, despite his claim that "man must not ever fall into the error of thinking that he was ever meant to be the lord and master of Nature."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Owing in part to such deployments of Darwin's science of gender, Woolf was generally suspicious of science, and she particularly distrusted her doctors, many of whom were active in the eugenics field.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Nonetheless, she read more sexological work in the last three years of her life than any period theretofore, including not just Darwin but "Victorian psychology" that denigrated women (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 132).<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> In portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, Woolf earnestly condemns this field's doctrine about women's "bondage" to men, to a cult of beauty, and to the preservation of hygiene. The character Mrs. Swithin, for example, reads throughout the novel a book titled "Outline of History," a fictionalized version of George Trevelyan's <span style="font-style:italic;">History of England</span> , a text premised on Darwinian principles. Such reading leads Swithin to wonder "'Who makes sex susceptible to beauty?'" and then skeptically to liken beauty to a boat that "sometimes leaks" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 139). Isa, moreover, considers reading Darwin—specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent of Man</span> in the early typescript—but instead reads a newspaper story about a woman raped by British soldiers (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 14; <span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 54).</p>
<p>Woolf's direct transition here from misogynist text to misogynist act clearly indicts Darwin. Rather than disregarding his theories altogether, however, Woolf proposes that women must redefine nature as infinitely mutable, Darwin's most consistent theorization of the concept. She records this ambition in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, writing that "Nature it was claimed who is not only omniscient but unchanging, had made the brain of woman of the wrong shape or size [. . .] Science, it would seem, is not sexless; she is a man" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 39). Like Elizabeth Grosz, who has recently demonstrated Darwin's urgent relevance to contemporary feminist theory, Woolf does not repudiate nature altogether on the basis of such constructions but asks instead, "Must we not, and do we not change this unalterable nature?"<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, during the composition of which she claimed to "want to take naturalists notes—human naturalists notes," Woolf changes science's misogynist nature by parodying it: she depicts all of humanity under the weight of Darwin's oppressive principle of feminine submission, stripping life of constructed difference to return it to Darwin's infinitely variegated state of nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 339). Woolf camps sexual selection, in other words, to concentrate natural selection and variation.</p>
<p>With this parody, Woolf also attacks Hitler's deployment of Darwin's theory of sexual selection in his rhetoric of <span style="font-style:italic;">völkisch</span> hierarchy and submission to the Führer. Resonant of Hitler's demand that the masses adhere to "the aristocratic principle of Nature" and "like a woman [. . .] rather bow to the strong man than dominate the weakling," Woolf forces <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s female protagonists (indeed, all of its human characters) to submit to the domination of a post-Darwinian nature: as Isa muses, "'How I am burdened with what they drew from the earth [. . .] 'Kneel down,' said the past'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 69, 50; <span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 106). Even Giles, the novel's self-declared "active" character who famously kills a toad-engorged snake in a scene of suggestive homophobia, feels "manacled to a rock" in preparation to watch the pageant, "forced passively to behold indescribable horror."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Whereas dominant modernist feminist movements attempted "to reverse the old association of woman with Nature"—the ideological fiction of nature as passive and unchanging that still permeates critical theory today—Woolf portrays women <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and men alike submitting to a transformative nature, such that submission to it is not a concession of but an acquisition of agency, specifically the participation in universal material differentiation.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> thus offers a queer feminist ethic of submission that parodically repudiates Darwin's, not to mention Hitler's, insistence that women embody hygienic and passive roles in socio-sexual relations mediated by the aesthetic of beauty.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In historical terms, this ethic represents what Theodor Adorno calls modern art's "feeling for nature," or art's ethical attempt to reveal the "wound" of what the Enlightenment aesthetics "of freedom and human dignity" ultimately "oppressed: animal, landscape, woman."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> This wound "is sensually displeasing and repugnant," Adorno writes, and includes feelings involved in "polymorphous sexuality," for the Enlightened aesthetic taboo against nature was in many ways "a sexual one: Nothing should be moist; art becomes hygienic" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AT</span>, 47, 116). Woolf requests such a feeling for nature in her essay "On Being Ill" , wherein she complains that "literature does its best to maintain that its concern is with the mind" and calls for "a new language that we need, more primitive, more sensual, more obscene" that can represent states of physical degradation like illness.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Considering that degeneration was considered a biological ailment and that Woolf declared that "the war is like desperate illness," "On Being Ill" anticipates how Woolf deploys primitive, obscene language in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, during the composition of which she was conscious of her "defiance of professional decency. About being an outsider" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 285, 251).</p>
<p>In her late work, Woolf's feeling for nature consistently emerges in her depictions of how women acquire agency in unhygienic states and locales. Expanding the spatial, temporal, and sensory coordinates of the "sound-proof room" that she requested in 1929 on the feminist logic that "intellectual freedom depends upon material things," Woolf replaces the room of one's own with the prehistoric cave and the public restroom stall (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 49, 101). These rooms are rooms of our own: rooms in which the human species publicly exposes its submission to nature, rooms in which personal freedom depends upon the freedom of material things like bodies themselves.</p>
<p>The conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> features this first kind of space: the cave, an atavistic site of violent sexuality. Discussing Isa and Giles, the married couple whose strained relationship suffuses the novel's pages, the scene reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Left alone together for the first time that day, they were silent. Alone, enmity was bared; also love. Before they slept, they must t; after they had fought, they would embrace. From that embrace another life might be born. But first they must t, as the dog fox ts with the vixen, in the heart of darkness, in the fields of night.</p>
<p>Isa let her sewing drop. The great hooded chairs had become enormous. And Giles too. And Isa too against the window. The window was all sky without colour. The house had lost its shelter. It was night before roads were made, or houses. It was the night that dwellers in caves had watched from some high place among rocks.</p>
<p>Then the curtain rose. They spoke.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 149) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">At first glance, this scene might seem anything but queer, let alone feminist, for it resolves the novel's marriage plot between Isa and Giles, forcing them to both "t" and "embrace" in the night to come, where the word <span style="font-style:italic;">embrace</span> functions as a euphemism for sexual intercourse that "might" reproductively bear "another life." Signaled by an equivocal "might" that includes the possibility of non-reproductive sexual behavior, however, this scene is actually written by a queer character in the novel named Miss La Trobe, who scribes the two plays featured in the novel: the first, the failed pageant play; and the second, the play with which the novel closes but that, unlike the pageant, is not demarcated by discourse tags. With what are ultimately stage directions for a new play, Woolf strips her novel of external mediation here and makes the novel the drama.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>As I will explore more fully in the next section, La Trobe's first play spoils national political and literary tradition through its ironic failure. If the camp aesthetic, construed "in terms of deficiency, decline, and the past [. . .] might be said to function as a kind of <span style="font-style:italic;">ironic</span> nostalgia," the pageant camps its characters' nostalgia for an English history wherein "all the important things had stayed the same."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> As the pageant degenerates into chaos, its audience members degenerate into an emotional collectivity stripped of claims to national identity, one resembling the Society of Outsiders that Woolf claims must reject "all such ceremonies as encourage the desire to impose 'our' civilization or 'our' dominion upon other people" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 114). Before the play, the owners of Pointz Hall admire their own genealogies and how their home was built "'obviously to escape from nature'" despite its proximity to a "cesspool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 6, 3). Yet the owner's sister Mrs. Swithin realizes while reading her "Outline of History" that there were once "rhododendron forests in Piccadilly; when the entire continent [. . .] was all one" and contained "the iguanadon, the mammoth, and the mastadon; from whom, presumably, she thought, jerking the window open, we descend" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 7). Allegorized in the pageant's paratactic disruption of historical continuity, history in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> becomes a circle rather than a line so that Swithin may wonder whether women like herself not only "descend" from mastadons but may be, as Giles' father fears, "'ourselves, degenerate descendants'" and descend to their ancestors' level—may devolve toward nature rather than be able "'to escape from nature'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 34).</p>
<p>La Trobe's second play literalizes this descent and disrupts the heteronormative telos of Isa and Giles' sexual behavior. In its atavistic context, this disruption also unsettles what, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolution's Rainbow</span> , Joan Roughgarden has persuasively proven to be the heteronormative implications of Darwin's theory of sexual selection. La Trobe's ironic euphemism <span style="font-style:italic;">embrace</span>, for example, reads laughably high amid the harrowingly low context of dog fox and vixen ting, which in the early typescript Woolf rendered as their murderous attempt "to tear each other asunder" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 188). These cave-dwellers' sex moreover concludes with biting irony a novel wherein characters wring their hands about what constitutes the "unhygienic" and may parody Hitler's proclamation that "he who would live must t. He who does not wish to t in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist," a proclamation that could derive from Darwin's sentiment that "the season of love is that of battle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 109, 118; <span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 261; <span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 48). It is doubtful that Hitler, who endorses only the most <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  civilized, even superhuman, kinds of sexuality, would agree that animalistic sex is the kind of ting that ensures one's "right to exist."</p>
<p>If, as Jane Marcus argues, Woolf suggests in this scene that "the origin of aggression, war, and oppression is in the origin of the species, in the drama of the battle of the sexes," Woolf also indicates that the comic resolution of such tragic forces may be found by descending to that origin.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Both possibilities inhere in Darwin's unidentified origin of the species, which he calls a "mystery of mysteries" and which is if anything a metonymy for the perpetual transformation of species' identities.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Framed by ironic camping, La Trobe's equivocal "might" responds "yes" to the audience members' collective question about her first failed play: "'D'you think people change? Their clothes, of course. . . . But I mean ourselves'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 83). Submitting to nature, La Trobe suggests, people can and should change much more than their artificial trappings.</p>
<p>As the novel's queerest re, La Trobe in fact insists that sexual feeling itself can change with atavistic devolution. Whereas Elizabeth Abel argues that "heterosexuality is repeatedly insinuated as our covert truth" in res like Isa, Isa maintains an ironic distance from her own heterosexuality throughout the novel.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> The narrator claims that, externally, Isa "never looked like Sappho or one of the beautiful young men whose photographs adorned the weekly papers," yet Isa interally bucks convention: she feels "entangled, by her husband, the stockbroker," for example, and "loathed the domestic, the possessive; the maternal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 11-12, 5, 14). Rather than forcing Isa to capitulate to misogynist oppression, as Marcus argues, La Trobe's script for Isa proposes that she make public such private emotions by denuding herself of the civilized identity that makes her "'loo[k] what she was: Sir Richard's daughter.'"<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>La Trobe strips Isa of this identity by troping her as an animal and cave-dweller. In her atavistic descent, Isa submits to the "enormous" husband of whom "she was afraid," thus literalizing "marriage" as a "damnable servility," yet she thereby grows powefully "enormous" herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 35). Isa gains such agency, I would argue, because La Trobe has made her submit to her ego's shattering, a shattering that releases Isa's private non-normative feelings. As animal and cave-dweller, Isa looks nothing like "Sir Richard's daughter," and her ability to challenge Giles and the social normativity he represents grows proportionally as she allows her queer nature to violate her social identity.</p>
<p>Queering the novel's most seemingly heteronormative woman, La Trobe quells Isa's frustration with her own life's plot: "love and hate—how they tore her asunder! Surely it was time someone invented a new plot, or that the author came out from the bushes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 146). Considering that Isa's age is "the age of the century, thirty nine," her new "plot" could metonymically represent the queer plot that Woolf advises her own era to follow (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 14). Whereas the pageant play records English history, after all, La Trobe's second play records a sexual history wherein reproduction submits to the object world's unpredictable productions and what they "might" bear. In a scene that comprises Woolf's boldest display of queer feminism, La Trobe violates to humble, not condemn, dominant social forms like heterosexuality before nature's queer transformations.</p>
<p>In her final completed piece of writing, a short story titled "The Watering Place" —which she typed palimpsestically on a draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>—Woolf writes a similarly <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  disturbing scene about the end of days from a perch in another obscene room of our own: a toilet in a public women's restroom. Inspired by Woolf's listening to women "powdering &amp; painting, these common little tarts, while I sat, behind a thin door, p—ing as quietly as I could" in "the ladies lavatory at the Sussex Grill at Brighton," the story depicts the daily habits of people in a small seaside town, focally those in a women's restroom pervaded by a "fishy smell" and divided into two sections by a door: "on the one side of the door the claims of nature were gratified; and on the other, at the washing table, at the looking-glass, nature was disciplined by art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 356-7). In a scene of bathroom humor foreshadowed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>,<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Woolf depicts here the irony that women's restrooms are places where people go to defecate and urinate, to let nature run its course, but also to discipline nature through the self-application of cosmetics. The story then documents "three young ladies" who "were exerting their rights upon improving nature, subduing her, with their powder puffs and little red tablets. As they did so they talked; but their talk was interrupted as by the surge of an indrawing tide," the sound of a toilet flushing. As the women gossip about a man whose amorous behavior may lead him to "'be courtmartialled,'" the narrator records the ability of the natural "tide" "to uncove[r] these little fish," the artificial women, and the "queer fishy smell that seems to permeate the whole watering place."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>The "queer fishy smell" of the watering place, or bathroom, is evidently the natural odor of decay that cannot be concealed with "powder puffs and little red tablets." The story concludes with Woolf's dire vision of what the town becomes at night: "The town has sunk down into the water. And the skeleton only is picked out in fairy lamps."<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> When nature dominates civilization—when a town appears "sunk down into the water"—artifice, the "fairy lamps," can only illuminate the denuded core of humanity: "the skeleton." Rather than a grim portrayal of death's inevitability, these sentences offer this otherwise humorous story's serious theme that civilization must strip itself of its constructed identity, especially in the face of more trenchant problems than how carefully one's facial powder is applied or whether a man's sexual behavior warrants legal prosecution. To do otherwise is, as Woolf's skeletal vision evokes, to cultivate race suicide caused by artificial decadence and not, as most degeneration theorists proposed, biophysical degeneration.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> From her stoop on the public toilet, Woolf's narrator encapsulates Woolf's notion in "On Being Ill" that "it is only the recumbent who know what, after all, Nature is at no pains to conceal—that she in the end will conquer [. . .] but with the hook of life in us still we must wriggle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 4: 198). For Woolf, it is not by "conceal[ing]" but by being down, "recumbent" and "ill," that allows one the chance to "wriggle" within the necessarily agonizing process of being biological that Darwin calls the "Struggle for Existence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">OS</span>, 77).</p>
<p>"The Watering Place" extends the savage indictment of the cult of beauty that Woolf began in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> not only with its final scene but also with the character Mrs. Manresa, who envisions herself as a "wild child of nature" but who is too preoccupied with upholding her image to engage the world around her, which shows how her "nature was somehow 'just human nature'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 29, 71). During the pageant play's "present day" scene, in fact, in which La Trobe forces the audience to reflect on itself <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by directing her actors to hold mirrors to the spectators, Manresa uses the mirrors to apply her make-up, missing entirely La Trobe's point that, as one of the servants at Pointz Hall thinks, "if it was painful, it was essential. There must be society" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 26). A "woman of action" alone, Manresa wants to dominate nature with artifice, which is for Woolf tantamount to murdering nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 76). Through the example of such characters, Woolf rejects the cult of beauty in which Darwin and Hitler alike inculcate women and proposes in "Watering" that women cultivate themselves in rooms that expose their "queer fishy smell."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>As she does with <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s "embrace," Woolf offers with this story's titular word <span style="font-style:italic;">watering</span>—not to mention her diary's redacted word "p—ing"—a euphemism about obscenity that parodies the cult of sanitization that her narrator hears in the restroom. Both texts' euphemisms exemplify what Walkowitz calls "the tension between decent feelings and dissenting thought" in Woolf's work that produce "models of social critique that would resist social codification."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Woolf uses euphemism here in part to parody wartime propaganda's own sanitary euphemisms of health and heroism. Like David Jones, who in his long poem <span style="font-style:italic;">In Parenthesis</span>  mocks the technology of modern warfare for producing a "perfectly sanitary war," Woolf derides civilized decency as ethically indecent: as culpable for the violence it conceals with ethical platitudes or, in the case of "Watering," cosmetics.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> To refuse this discussion is to relegate the ineluctable conclusion of biological being, what Woolf called the "tremendous experience" of death, to fodder for either egoistic ideals or the patronizing presumption that death is the failure of life (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 230). If Woolf's camp renderings of a couple's violent sex or a town's mass death disturb, then, it is because she does violence to our own attempts to sanitize death, attempts that are for her a violence to death—and the life that led to it—itself.</p>

<p>If "p—ing" is what happens in Woolf's public restroom stall, "f—ing" is what happens not only in her atavistic cave but also throughout the degenerate, theatrical world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>. Woolf uses such euphemisms at the level of diction to place into relief the obscenity she depicts through dramatic form, including the obscenity of national and literary tradition. The novel's rising curtain, after all, makes theatre of Isa and Giles' intercourse, locating laughable and terrifying private acts on the public page and stage. Woolf offers this scene of "f—ing" as her own contribution to the literary and national histories she mocks in the pageant play, using the drama to concentrate—both distill and make public—the novel of interiority. Opposed to her view in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that her "Society of Outsiders," "remaining outside, will experiment not with public means in public but with private means in private," the Society of Outsiders in the book that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Woolf herself called "the wild, the experimental" literally remains outside, experimenting with private means in public both to strip privacy of its location in the self and to shock the public into a concentrated collectivity (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 113; <span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 228).</p>
<p>The very title of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> suggests how Woolf uses the drama to distill particularities, for she changed the title from "Pointz Hall, the Pageant: the Play—finally [to] Between the Acts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 356). Moving from a specific location steeped in national identity through particular artistic forms to an abstract concept of liminality, the title's mutation allegorizes how Woolf's aesthetic of concentration propagates variety by despoiling singularity. Such variety, she writes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, includes "all lit. discussed in connection with real little incongruous living humour; &amp; anything that comes into my head; but 'I' rejected: 'We' substituted [. . .] perpetual variety &amp; change from intensity to prose. &amp; facts—&amp; notes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 135). With the "perpetual variety &amp; change" of the novel's form, Woolf substitutes the singular "I" of modernist interiority with a collective "we" that feels the novel's "variety of moods," including "incongruous living humor."</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s titular transformation also highlights Woolf's career-long fascination with the tension between the novel and the drama, about which she ultimately theorized a relationship. She claimed that "it's possible that the novel to us is what the drama was to the Greeks" and Elizabethans and valued especially their comedies' "very sharp delicate laughter."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> When she goes on to compare contemporary novels with "the comic passages" of Elizabethan plays, Woolf claims that "the emotion [is] all split up, dissipated and then woven together, slowly and gradually massed into a whole, in the novel; the emotion concentrated, generalised, heightened in the play."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> Woolf suggests here that the novel, which distills emotion from the general ("split up") to the particular ("massed into a whole"), might learn from the drama, especially comedy, how to distill and thereby proliferate emotion from the "concentrated" particular to the "generalised" plurality.</p>
<p>In "The Narrow Bridge of Art" , Woolf explains how this generic concentration is both aesthetically and affectively queer. She mourns the loss of poetic drama from contemporary letters because drama can encompass "monstrous, hybrid, unmanageable emotions," "this discord, this incongruity, this sneer, this contrast, this curiosity, the quick, queer emotions": in short, "that queer conglomeration of incongruous things—the modern mind."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Because the novel has, she writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, been burdened by "the dominance of the letter 'I' and the aridity [. . .] it cases within its shade" , the novel that survives literary tradition "will be dramatic, and yet not a play. It will be read, not acted. By what name we are to call it is not a matter of very great importance."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Here Woolf encompasses the formal and epistemological premises of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, which shall be a "monstrous, hybrid" book that, like the collective queer feeling it examines, defies taxonomy, or "what name we are to call it."</p>
<p>On the structural level of narrative form, Woolf's dramatic theory of fiction shapes how <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> conveys the conflict between individual and collective experience. Woolf outlines these effects in her uncompleted essay "Anon," which she began to write just after completing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and which she intended to be a history of English literature. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  In the text, Woolf envisions an androgynous character named Anon, similar to the writer she had envisioned in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, a "sometimes man; sometimes woman" who "lives a roaming life" singing "the call to our primitive instincts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 91-2; <span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 675). A metonymy for "the theatre," Anon represents the kind of atavistic, anti-identitarian self that Woolf wants, but purposefully fails, to produce in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 678). "Anonymity was a great possession" in the age of drama, she argues, but modern literature requires that "the individual on the stage becomes more and more differentiated," such that "the theatre must be replaced by the theatre of the brain. The playwright is replaced by the man who writes a book. The audience is replaced by the reader. Anon is dead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">GOM</span>, 692, 693). Resurrecting Anon in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s theatrical form, Woolf also threatens Anon's anonymity with the novel form's focus on individuality, as evidenced by the pageant's playwright, who is both sexed and named—though only, importantly, surnamed. Identity's threat to Anon thus constitutes the formal and thematic drama of Woolf's novel.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, Woolf maintained that this conflict was best conveyed through the mode of comedy. She believed that "you can only get comedy by using the surface layer," but such surfaces are for her detritus to be stripped away, revealing "much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface" and "the most enduring form of life [in] scenes which are outwardly trivial" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 347, 197). An admirer of Jane Austen's comedies, Woolf averred that such comedic stripping was an eminently feminist mode.<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> In her 1905 essay "The Value of Laughter," for example, Woolf writes that "comedy is of the sex of the graces and the muses," whereas tragedy's "decorous [. . .] spirit of solemnity" is male (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 58). As it has throughout literary history, "comedy has a hard t for it," Woolf believes, because laughter is said to be "an inarticulate utterance like the bark of a dog or the bleat of sheep, and it is beneath the dignity of a race that has made itself a language to express itself thus" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 58-9). Co-opting such misogyny, Woolf embraces the bestial, "inarticulate utterance" as a tool with which to humble, for "laughter more than anything else preserves our sense of proportion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1: 59). Whereas men are burdened with the "hideous excrescences that have overgrown our modern life, the pomps and conventions and dreary solemnities," women possess, Woolf says, "a knife that both prunes and trains": the "flash of laughter which, like lightning, shrivels them [the excrescences] up and leaves the bones bare."<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>Such pruning is central to Woolf's antifascist politics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, she claims that "laughter as an antidote to dominance is perhaps indicated," laughter that allows one "to strip each statement of its [. . .] vanity motive [. . .] before you make up your mind which fact about politics to believe" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 182, 96). Just as laughter prunes fascism's vanity, generic hybridity dismantles fascist attempts to dominate variety with purity. Woolf in fact complains in her essay "Modern Fiction"  that the writer "seems constrained [. . .] by some powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall to provide a plot, to provide comedy, tragedy, love, interest, and an air of probability embalming the whole."<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> Rejecting that tyrant's dictates, Woolf yearns for a style about which "it is impossible to say 'this is comic,' or 'that is tragic,'"<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> a style that might take the shape of formal opacity: as she writes, "Ease and freedom, the power to change and the power to grow, can only be preserved by obscurity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 14). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The "obscurity" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s formal structure ironically derives from its very light pageant play, which paratactically juxtaposes scenes from English comedies resembling texts like <span style="font-style:italic;">As You Like It</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Love for Love</span>. Woolf replicates the pageant's confusing parataxis at the level of her narrative's diegesis. In the novel's first fifty-three pages, an unidentified narrator reports the actions, speech, and interior thoughts of various characters (the latter through free indirect discourse). When the play begins, however, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> consists primarily of staged dialogue and of dialogue between and among the audience members in response to the play, itself an obscuring narratological technique since actors' and characters' speech often blur together such that characters wonder, "was it, or was it not, the play?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 53). With intermittent narrative and stream-of-consciousness paragraphs, this dialogue continues for eighty-three pages; the text then reverts to narrative mediation in the remaining nineteen pages. Altogether, then, the play and characters' dialogue about the play—Isa says, "'I wish the play didn't run in my head'"—arguably occupies more space in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> than does the narrative reportage.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>Given this proportion, why, if Woolf thought that "Pointz Hall is to become in the end a play," did she frame that play within prose narrative (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5:139)? An answer to this question resides in the novel's title, which invokes not only the plot's temporal location between two acts of world war but its structural division between two kinds of speech act: the mediated and the unmediated. Framed between its mediated narrative acts, the characters' increasingly unmediated dramatic speech—such that even scripted theatrical speech comes to resemble spontaneous public utterance—exposes them at their most individually and collectively concentrated forms. As Froula persuasively argues, "in the acts between the acts, and in the spectators' thoughts and feelings, pageant and novel seek a 'natural law' by which to build civilization's broken 'wall.'"<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> Unable to understand the play's paratactic structure, the audience members abandon private reflection and attempt to communicate verbally about the text's meaning; in doing so, they imitate the natural world around them, "the trees tossing and the birds swirling [who] seemed called out of their private lives [. . .] and made to take part" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 129-30; 80-1).</p>
<p>Woolf uses the drama to elicit public feelings from her private characters, then, going so far as to represent their private thoughts in public form. When Giles "said (without words), 'I'm damnably unhappy,'" for example, William Dodge and Isa "echoed" and "thought" in response "'So am I'" and "'I too,'" respectively (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 119). Violating novelistic privacy by publicizing the individual's thoughts as dramatic speech, Woolf allegorizes in this passage the conflict between the novel and the drama genres. In distilled, simple sentences, the passage reports only the audience's negative feelings. In accord with Woolf's comparison of these genres, the drama concentrates the novelistic characters' emotions such that Isa later realizes the pageant "was only there to beget emotion. There were only two emotions: love; and hate. There was no need to puzzle out the plot" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 63). If, as Darwin writes, "laughter" is "analogous with weeping" because both release "superfluous nervous energy," Woolf strips her characters of superfluous affects with a play that enjoins them to feel in concentrated form.<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>What La Trobe repeatedly calls the play's "failure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 68, 142) thus produces distilled, incongruous emotions in the audience and what Sontag would call a "naïve, or pure, Camp" aesthetic in the novel, one in which "the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naïve" ("Notes," 59). La Trobe in all earnestness aims to create "a vision imparted [that] was relief from agony," and when that vision fails, she reacts in the most "exaggerated" and "passionate" of terms: "Blood seemed to pour from her shoes. This is death, death, death, she noted in the margin of her mind; when illusion fails" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 68, 122). Since biological death does threaten the entire community, La Trobe's "fantastic" response appears laughably naïve, as does her literalist attempt at play's end to make the community reflect upon itself with mirrors. Although La Trobe wants in this scene "to expose them, as it were, to douche them, with present-time reality," her "douche" simply confuses her audience, who wonders, "'if we're left asking questions, isn't it a failure, as a play?'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 122, 135). Since the British pageant play traditionally functioned to glorify empire, yet this play ends with La Trobe lecturing her audience about how they're "<span style="font-style:italic;">Liars most of us. Thieves too</span>," one might answer "yes" to the audience's question (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 127). But as a play whose camp failure yields the audience's public intimacy, the pageant succeeds.</p>
<p>As a character, La Trobe embodies the very camp aesthetic that her play produces. She "had the look of a commander pacing his deck" and "the attitude proper to an Admiral," for example, yet La Trobe captains a small community play whose props consist of "cardboard crowns, swords made of silver paper, turbans that were sixpenny dish cloths"—a night at the Hippodrome this is not (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 43). La Trobe's entire life is in fact filled with failures: "Rumour said that she had kept a tea shop at Winchester; that had failed. She had been an actress. That had failed. She had bought a four-roomed cottage and shared it with an actress. They had quarrelled" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 40). While she actually shared a bed with that actress, La Trobe—like Dodge, the novel's would-be gay male character—is never identified as a lesbian in the text: she fails, one could say, to achieve that identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143).</p>
<p>La Trobe is so prone to failure that one might call her a masochist, or a Darwinian feminist, for she continually seeks ways to abuse herself. This sentiment was dear to Woolf herself: in 1934, for example, after learning of Wyndham Lewis's latest decrial of her work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Men Without Art</span> , Woolf writes that "I am feeling the calm that always comes to me with abuse: my back is against the wall [. . .] the queer disreputable pleasure in being abused—in being a re, in being a martyr. &amp; so on" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 251). Feeling powerless, backed up against the wall—the same phrase she uses to describe England in wartime and to describe how she does her "best work"—Woolf claims that "the feeling of being dismissed into obscurity is also pleasant &amp; salutary," for abuse teaches her to "to be supple &amp; naked to the truth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 297, 189, 252). In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf summarizes this view in aesthetic terms: she converts "moments [that] brought with them a peculiar horror and a physical collapse; they seemed dominant; myself passive" into a source of aesthetic pleasure and inspiration, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  such that "these sudden shocks [. . .] are now always welcome [. . .] And so I go on to suppose that the shock-receiving capacity is what makes me a writer." Violence thus teaches Woolf "that we—I mean all human beings—are connected with [. . .] the work of art [. . .] we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>With an acute "shock-receiving capacity" herself, La Trobe takes a "queer disreputable pleasure in being abused" and dismisses herself into obscurity for much of the pageant, central though she is to its creation. If "she was an outcast," as the narrator reports, whom "Nature had somehow set [. . .] apart from her kind," La Trobe casts herself further into nature's kind as she barks orders at actors and audience alike from behind a tree (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143, 53). Posed in "a stooping position" for much of the play, La Trobe is a diva without an audience, an admiral of a mutinous crew, a leader with only half a name (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 141). She is a camp failure as a character who embodies the dialectic between states of particularity and generality, identity and anonymity, that she, like Woolf, attempts to communicate with art wherein "all human beings—are connected."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Comedy of Natures</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</blockquote>
<p>Both of the plays that La Trobe composes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> could be called comedies of nature insofar as that mode's plot resembles a modernist degeneration narrative. In their relative discordance—the first more humorous, the second more harrowing—the plays comprise <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s own comedy of nature and proliferate the "infinitely varied diversities" and "variety of moods" that both Darwin and Woolf see in the concentrated world. Proliferating natures in nature—a material world where non-self-identity reigns supreme—Woolf parodies what Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno call fascism's endeavor "to place oppressed nature's rebellion against domination directly in the service of domination."<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> Bearing out Stephen Barber's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> "vigorously confronts the homophobic impulse of modern British culture to extinguish queer existence," the more that nature dominates in this novel, the more that its queer natures rebel against social domination.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>In point of fact, despite their attempts to escape from nature, <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s audience members watch the pageant play outdoors, which allows nature to interrupt the performance repeatedly, such that the natural and the theatrical fuse.<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> Most remarkably, just when La Trobe likens the play to death for failing, a herd of cows, as a campy <span style="font-style:italic;">deus ex machina</span>, "t[akes] up the burden" and begins to bellow, for "one had lost her calf": "From cow after cow came the same yearning bellow. The whole world was filled <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  with dumb yearning." This "primeval voice" transitions from tragic mourning to comic perversity, however, when "the whole herd caught the infection. Lashing their tails, blobbed like pokers, they tossed their heads high, plunged and bellowed, as if Eros had planted his dart in their flanks and goaded them to fury. The cows annihilated the gap; bridged the distance; filled the emptiness and continued the emotion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96). Tragic, comic, and above all theatrical, Woolf's campy cows bridge the gaps in La Trobe's paratactic play: the missing link in this literary history is nature.</p>
<p>Violating the play's attempt to consolidate human history, the cows are what Adorno would call the pageant play's "wound": they are the play's feeling for nature, for they show how "the reticence of nature was undone, and the barriers which should divide Man the Master from the Brute were dissolved" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 125). The cows dissolve that barrier by spreading their affective "infection" to the audience, as when "suddenly the cows stopped; lowered their heads, and began browsing. Simultaneously the audience lowered their heads and read their programmes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 96). Ruining the play, the cows ruin the audience's grip on its anthropocentrism: the audience becomes a herd led not by a dictator but by nature, specifically its incongruous, theatrically displayed feelings. Woolf allows nature to take back its claim to humanity by offering such scenes in which "nature takes her part" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 130). As La Trobe muses in the text's early typescript, "The great bosom of nature, she thought, takes our failures; but after all, she needs them."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to Marina MacKay's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s "closing emphasis on disintegration and fracture is so extreme that no centre could hold these characters together," the novel depicts nature as the unstable "centre" to which its failed characters concentrate.<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Locating the drama of identity and its concentration in the dash between the repeated words "<span style="font-style:italic;">Unity—Dispersity</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> depicts a social world in constant vacillation between collectivity and individuality (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 136). When the audience "t[akes] up the strain" of the pageant's refrain "<span style="font-style:italic;">Dispersed are we</span>," then, they ultimately perform a version of Woolf's concentrated camp: they ruminate about their own fracture, producing at play's end what reads like a collective stream of consciousness (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 66, 134-5). As Woolf's most innovative formal attempt to collapse the novel and the drama, this moment employs the most individually concentrated of modernist techniques to unite and disperse the text's characters. Such oscillation between civilization and nature, individuality and collectivity leads Mrs. Swithin to reflect that "sheep, cows, grass, trees, ourselves—all are one. If discordant, producing harmony [. . .] the agony of the particular sheep, cow, or human being is necessary [. . .] <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> is harmony, could we hear it," for we do not live in ourselves, she realizes: "We live in others."<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>With her first comedy, La Trobe helps the audience to "hear" Woolf's belief that "agony [. . .] is necessary" to produce "harmony." With her second play, La Trobe helps herself to hear to it. Her humiliation after the first comedy fails leads La Trobe to degenerate emotionally: "What she wanted, like that carp [. . .] was darkness in the mud; a whisky and soda at the pub; and coarse words descending like maggots through the waters" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 138). Absorbing the shock of her failure, La Trobe becomes enthusiastic about a new play but cannot conceive of its language: "'I should group them,' she <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  murmured, 'here.' It would be midnight; there would be two res, half concealed by a rock. The curtain would rise. What would the first words be? the words escaped her" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 143). But when she looks on a picture of "a cow in a stable; also at a cock and a hen," La Trobe finds her inspiration for those words in degeneration: "Words of one syllable sank down into the mud. [. . .] The mud became fertile. Words rose above the intolerably laden dumb oxen plodding through the mud. Words without meaning—wonderful words" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 144).</p>
<p>Able now to "hear it," La Trobe finds the "more primitive, more obscene" language—words fresh from the mud—with which Woolf writes <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and with which La Trobe composes her new play, the play that closes <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> and that unites, by concentrating the conflict between, the novel and the drama. In accord with Horkheimer and Adorno's belief that "only when apprehended as knowledge does [nature] become the urge of the living toward peace, the consciousness which, from the beginning, has inspired unerring resistance to <span style="font-style:italic;">Führer</span> and collective," La Trobe's temporary degeneration—her submission to the overpowering facts of nature—yields her regeneration, her ability to find peace within her failures.<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s final sentence, "They spoke," thus offers La Trobe's hopeful gesture that her comedies of nature will yield a new dialogue about our objects of concentration. Produced by her two comedies of love and hate, this dialogue might begin with the word "peace." As Isa earlier thinks, "peace was the third emotion. Love. Hate. Peace. Three emotions made the ply of human life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 64). It is Woolf's queer ambition with <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> to transform Isa's thought into speech, so that we might "hear it," perhaps even say it: so that peace might become the object of her public's concentration.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>While I do not intend to postulate about the motivations for and meaning of Woolf's death, it is worth noting that, while taking one's life could be one expression of the will to overcome egotism and self-containment that, I am arguing, Woolf endorsed, it would also foreclose her ethic of active concentration. Woolf's personal records and her final novel suggest that, whereas death marks the end of distraction and concentration both, the threat of death—the affective and psychic violation of the ego's boundaries—might motivate concentration. For a more sustained analysis of how Woolf represents in her life and writing "a division between a feeling of selfhood and a feeling of selflessness" through tropes of death and sexuality, see James Naremore's <span style="font-style:italic;">The World without a Self: Virginia Woolf and the Novel</span> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1973), 248.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>Perhaps not coincidentally, Darwin attends to the affect of sympathy more than any other emotion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Descent</span>, claiming that sympathy grounds the moral sense that distinguishes <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span> from the progenitors with whom he otherwise aims to correlate humans (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 394). Like Woolf, Darwin believes that sympathy "is one of the most important elements of the social instincts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 2: 393) yet is a somewhat masochistic emotion: "the basis of sympathy lies in our strong retentiveness of former states of pain or pleasure [. . .] we are thus impelled to relieve the sufferings of another, in order that our own painful feelings may be at the same time relieved" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 81).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f14" href="#f14-text">14. </a>My focus here on the degenerate side of modernist literature shares with Scott Herring's <span style="font-style:italic;">Queering the Underworld</span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007) an attempt to understand how modernist writers "sidestep sexual group identifications" . Herring examines a queer modernist literary tradition in which "queer" denotes not just the non-normative but the verbs "to puzzle" or "to spoil, put out of order," especially "to spoil (a person's) undertaking" . Whereas Herring proves how such spoilage undermines any attempt at community , however, Woolf creates a society of the spoiled: a society where feeling degenerate is a vehicle for social concentration.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>Woolf repeatedly tropes "living near to the bone" throughout her diary entries of this period. Most notably, after the bombing of her home in Tavistock Square during the Blitz, Woolf writes that "its odd, the relief at losing possessions. I shd like to start life, in peace, almost bare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 332). One of the few possessions that Woolf recovered from this bombing was a collection of Darwin's writings .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>As revealed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall: The Earlier and Later Typescripts of</span> Between the Acts, ed. Mitchell A. Leaska (New York: University Publications, 1983), Woolf enacted such emotional distillation in each draft of the novel. In general, Woolf made the text more humorous and less violent. As discussed on page 649 of this essay, for example, the novel's conclusion first ended with Isa and Giles intending a far more violent encounter than their ultimate "t." Moreover, the three emotions that Isa finally feels—"love, hate, peace"—were initially "four emotions [that] made the ply of man's life" in the drafts, where love and hate remained constant and were coupled alternately with "fear," "death," and "sorrow" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 105, 103-5). In the novel's final iteration, Woolf distills these negative feelings to "hate," which (like love) could but need not produce fear, death, and sorrow. Correcting her emotions' negative imbalance, Woolf focalizes how the incongruity between love and hate might produce "peace," a pacifist vision that relies not just on a concentration of emotional states but on the simultaneously positive and negative emotions that the camp aesthetic enjoins. <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall</span> hereafter abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f17" href="#f17-text">17. </a>Woolf could not have known of Hitler's Final Solution, announced in 1942, nor of the extermination camps; however, concentration camps that held political prisoners, Jews, homosexuals, and other persecuted people were beginning to be used for eugenic cleansing when Woolf finished <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>. One might nonetheless question the ethical or, more simply, the analytical use of contemplating Woolf's relation to the concentration camps if she not only did not live to know about their ultimate horror but did not herself experience the camps. Such an objection would rely, as Amy Hungerford writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Holocaust of Texts: Genocide, Literature, and Personification</span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), on the trend in Holocaust studies wherein "memory (the knowledge of what we have experienced) is privileged over learning," a position that limits imagination to identity . Yet "there is reason to believe that a just society requires imagination," not just memory, Hungerford writes, on the logic that "we must find not ourselves in the other (or the other in ourselves) but the other as we can know them without being them" . In my own imaginative endeavor to understand how Woolf aestheticizes WWII in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, I am analyzing not only Woolf's experience of the concentration camps, being placed in which seemed to her an acute threat, but her imagination of them—one that breaches an ethics of memory in the name of an ethics of imagination.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f18" href="#f18-text">18. </a>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific and Estoteric Studies in Sexual Degeneration in Mankind and in Animals</span> trans. Ulrich Van Der Horst (New York: Anthropological Press, 1932), Charles Samson Féré distinguished degeneration from atavism , but Cesare Lombroso—one of the first proponents of atavistic theory—held the majority view by, in texts like <span style="font-style:italic;">Genio e follia</span> (Genius and Insanity)  and <span style="font-style:italic;">L'uomo delinquente</span> (Criminal Man) , aligning degenerates with prior forms of biological development, whether in non-human animal or human stages (Daniel Pick, <span style="font-style:italic;">Faces of Degeneration: A European Disorder, c. 1848-1918</span> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989], 120). Darwin himself did not equate degeneracy and atavism: for him, reversion could be beneficial, destructive, or neutral, depending on the variation (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 124, 236). In his 1895 polemic <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneration</span> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993), Max Nordau voiced his agreement with Lombroso while expanding the definition of degeneracy so capaciously that it could include nearly anything that evoked a negative feeling (555-6). As Sander Gilman claims, "Degeneracy became as key for explaining the negative moments of human history as it was for explaining evolutionary regression in biology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Difference and Pathology: Stereotypes of Sexuality, Race, and Madness</span> [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985], 205). In its ultimate capaciousness, the term <span style="font-style:italic;">degenerate</span> came to denote in the 20<sup>th</sup> century—and still denotes today—a qualitative mode of experience rather than an identity: from a scientific perspective, degeneracy can refer to a process of biophysical enervation and/or reversion; and from an aesthetic perspective, degeneracy denotes a range of qualities associated with the negative but especially qualities (sexual license, aesthetic experimentation, racial otherness) that contradict dominant expectations for civilized culture. For more on modernist theories of degeneracy and atavism, see Dana Seitler's <span style="font-style:italic;">Atavistic Tendencies: The Culture of Science in American Modernity</span> (Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press, 2008) and Eugene Talbot's <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneracy: Its Causes, Signs and Results</span> (New York: Scribner's, 1898).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f19" href="#f19-text">19. </a>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Comedy and the Woman Writer: Woolf, Spark, and Feminism</span> (London: University of Nebraska Press, 1983), Judy Little persuasively contends that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> offers a "festive comedy" that "celebrates th[e] capacity of nature, and of human nature, for regeneration" ; in "The Politics of Comic Modes in Virginia Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 105.2 [March 1990]: 273-85), Melba Cuddy-Keane similarly argues that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> lies primarily within the comic genre" . Yet Jed Esty calls the novel "a tragic document of the liberal imagination under pressure, forced to confront the political limitations of the 'English way'" , and Mitchell Leaska nominates it as no less than "the longest suicide note in the English language" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 451). Despite their diametrically opposing views, these scholars are not only writing about the same novel but highlighting crucial elements of this incongruous text that mutually inform Woolf's vision of a queer feminist politics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiction and Repetition: Seven English Novels</span> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), J. Hillis Miller attends most faithfully to this dual sentiment when he writes that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> is throughout, especially in the pageant, a work of outrageous and hilarious parody [. . .] Parody is repetition as praise, but it is destruction too" .</p></div>

As Michael North disclaims in <span style="font-style:italic;">Machine-Age Comedy</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), any attempt at defining the comedic mode is challenging, if not impossible, because its manifestations have changed throughout literary and theatrical history—itself a subject of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s pageant play . For the purposes of this argument, nontheless, it is worth noting that the mode classically features several of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>'s formal structures. In terms of character, comedy typically focuses upon a society rather than individuals such that, in narrative terms, comedy lacks a stand-out protagonist. Comedic societies consist, Aristotle records in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetics</span>, of base characters: "Comedy aims at representing men as worse [. . .] Tragedy as better than in actual life" . The comedy is "an imitation of characters of a lower type," then, where "lower" is determined by "some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive" . Because of this focus, comedy has, in the history of Western literature and performance, assumed an inferior role to tragedy, that "highest" of dramatic forms, ironically because tragedy charts the degeneration of a privileged (typically male) character to ignominy . In terms of plot, comedy presents a conflict that destabilizes and then restores the status quo with which the plot opens . Comedy may be deemed structurally atavistic, then, for it returns to its origin rather than develops toward some inevitable telos, the linear goal of tragedy . See James English's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comic Transactions: Literature, Humor, and the Politics of Community in Twentieth-Century Britain</span> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1994) for a compelling examination of comedy in British modernism, including in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>, and Joseph Meeker's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Comedy of Survival: Literary Ecology and a Play Ethic</span> (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1997) for an insightful discussion of the structural similarities between comedy and evolution.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f23" href="#f23-text">23. </a>Darwin bases this claim on the evidence of innocuous racial differences, which show <span style="font-style:italic;">homos sapiens</span> to "have remained extremely variable, owing, as it seems, to their variations being of an indifferent nature, and consequently to their having escaped the action of natural selection" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 249).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f24" href="#f24-text">24. </a>Following Woolf's lead, I avoid the term "tragicomedy" to describe this novel not only because that mode has proven even more difficult to define in literary history than tragedy and comedy but because no definition of the mode attends to the plot reversal I am describing here, wherein tragedy's plot is made comedic. The most standard definitions of tragicomedy are that it features tragedy's danger without its deaths (<span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> features several reports of death and a bloody murder); that it reverses the roles of gods and slaves (<span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> abjures the god role, or elevation, altogether to propose total degradation); and that it envisions a yet unrealized future, whereas Woolf gives her characters that future in the atavistic past. See Verna Foster's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy</span> (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004) for further discussion of the mode.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>By describing Darwin's theory of nature as queer, I mean to highlight that Darwin theorizes the material world as endlessly mutable and non-normative (defiant of any telos or regulatory standard) and therefore inclusive of what would by any era's terms of sexual normativity be deemed non-normative sexual feeling. In the past few years, a spate of scholarship written largely from an ecocritical perspective has addressed the concept of a "queer nature," including Myra J. Hird's "Naturally Queer" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Feminist Theory</span> 5.1 [2004]: 85-9), Timothy Morton's "Queer Ecology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 125.2 [March 2010], 1-19), and Catriona Mortimer-Sandliands and Bruce Erickson's edited volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Queer Ecologies: Sex,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature, Politics, Desire</span> (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2010). While I am in sympathy with such work, I aim in this essay and the larger project from which it emerges to examine less the eco-political than the literary historical and queer theoretical implications of Darwin's theory of the material world.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f33" href="#f33-text">33. </a>As Isherwood portrays in his 1939 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Goodbye to Berlin</span> (in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Berlin Stories</span> [New York: New Directions, 1963]), German cabaret performances featured similar blends of horror and humor to ridicule the Nazi regime, which quickly closed the cabarets upon its rise to power. Though Woolf rejects those cabarets' investment in camp's material trappings, it is worth noting that Isherwood's descriptions of Sally Bowles's nails as "hard, bright, ugly little beetles"  and her coat as the "skin of a mangy old dog"  anticipate Woolf's atavistic aesthetic. Though they lack Woolf's comedy of nature, many artistic texts have used concentrated camp to examine the Holocaust. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Laughter in Hell:The Use of Humor during the Holocaust</span> (London: Jason Aronson Inc., 1991), Steve Lipman records a substantial portion of such texts, including Charlie Chaplin's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Dictator</span> —which was itself subject to ethical scrutiny, including Chaplin's own after the war —Tadeusz Borowski's short story collection <span style="font-style:italic;">This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</span> , Mel Brooks' slapstick film and Broadway musical <span style="font-style:italic;">The Producers</span> (1968, 2001), Peter Barnes' play <span style="font-style:italic;">Auschwitz</span> , Art Spiegelman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Maus I</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Maus II</span> , Robert Benigni's film <span style="font-style:italic;">Life is Beautiful</span> , and Jonathan Safran Foer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything Is Illuminated</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</span> . Rodney Ackland's 1951 play <span style="font-style:italic;">Absolute Hell</span> (London: Oberon Books, 1990) is of particularly relevant note, since it features a group of queer characters that gathers in a bar after WWII to talk about the relationship between the prison camps and the camp aesthetic, a relationship one character synthesizes as "horror camp" (36, 38, 56).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f34" href="#f34-text">34. </a>Lipman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Laughter in Hell</span>, 9; Viktor Frankl, <span style="font-style:italic;">Man's Search for Meaning: an Introduction to Logotherapy</span>, trans.

Frankl warns against pious attitudes toward camp victims "mingled with sentiment and pity"  and records that the camps were filled with a rigorous ethic of humor, even as (and surely because) "the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded" . "Humor was another of the soul's weapons in the t for self-preservation," he writes, as evidenced by Lipman's record of how children in the camps played games like "Gas Chamber" and "Gestapo Agent" and how prisoners formed a clandestine theatrical group in Dachau, scribing and performing plays with lines like "Everything is hell / Soon it will get well / Through this magic word: humor, humor!" (42, 14, 72). Such humor was necessary, Frankl writes, in the face of the apathy that often accrued from witnessing so much suffering. Indeed, "disgust, horror and pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel any more" because death and decay "became such commonplace sights" . Humor allowed a kind of ironic shock to the apathetic system, Frankl avers, "a trick learned while mastering the art of living" . Frankl also records that camp life required a "retreat to a more primitive form of mental life": one stripped of civilized provisions wherein "the effort of having to concentrate on just saving one's skin led to a total disregard of anything not serving that purpose," which "explain[s] the prisoners' complete lack of sentiment" (27, 32).</p></div>

"Those reproductive habits which on the one hand are determined by social pressure and, on the other, by financial considerations," he says, "lea[d] to absolute degeneration" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 226). His solution for such socially-based matrimonial arrangements—those that lead to cross-race and cross-class reproduction—is for the State to sanction marriage "as an institution which is called upon to produce creatures made in the likeness of the Lord and not create monsters that are a mixture of man and ape" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 365).</p></div>

To remedy venereal disease, Hitler proposes early marriages, which will allow men to settle down early; women's choices are irrelevant, "for women are, after all, only passive subjects in this matter" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MK</span>, 228).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f49" href="#f49-text">49. </a>Specifically, while composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, Woolf was not only exposed to the experience of her close friend Lytton Strachey, who was a member of the British Society for the Study of Sex and Psychology, but met with feminist and sexologist Marie Stopes; "read all Havelock Ellis," whose work she found "teased and tired" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 5: 270); and read Freud for the first time, despite having published him for years. Although scholars have focused profitably on the implications of Woolf's reading of Freud while she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> (see Cuddy-Keane, "Politics of Comic Modes," 274), few scholars have considered her perhaps even more remarkable attention to Darwin's work while composing the novel. For analyses that begin to broach Woolf's engagement with evolutionary science in this text, see Harriet Blodgett's "The Nature of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Language Studies</span> 13.3 [Summer 1983]: 27-37, 36); Gillian Beer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: The Common Ground</span> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996); and Elizabeth Lambert's "Evolution and Imagination in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pointz Hall</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>" (in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: Themes and Variations</span>, eds. Vara Neverow-Turk and Mark Hussey [New York: Pace University Press, 1993], 25-32).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f50" href="#f50-text">50. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">TG</span>, 49) Woolf's call for a Darwinian feminist epistemology here anticipates Grosz's contemporary intervention into feminist politics in both <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution and the Untimely</span> (Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2004) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Travels: Feminism, Nature, Power</span> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2005). Writes Grosz, "A reconration of nature as dynamic, of matter as culturally productive, of time as a force of proliferation, is thus central to the ways feminism itself may be able <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to move beyond the politics of equalization to more actively embrace a politics affirmative of difference elaborated in the most dynamic forms of feminist theory today" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nick of Time</span>, 72). Grosz's study insists perhaps too limitedly, however, on what she calls Darwin's being "one of the few thinkers of the nineteenth century to prere, not simply an egalitarian feminism, but a feminism, or perhaps more broadly, an ontology of sexual difference" wherein such binary difference is "irreducible" (10, 67). This irreducibility would appear to defy Grosz's (let alone Darwin's own) claims to nature's non-binary variability. As Joan Roughgarden has more recently and extensively in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People</span> (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004), Grosz acknowledges, after all, that sexual selection "produces variations—the intersexes—that lie between bifurcated categories," such that "the posthuman future is more likely to be sexually differentiated (in whatever form) than anything else we recognize in the present" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nick of Time</span>, 67).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f51" href="#f51-text">51. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">BTA</span>, 69, 41-2) Giles kills the animals because the snake-toad looks to him like "birth the wrong way round—a monstrous inversion" . With his heteronormative, masculinist logic about right ways to reproduce, Giles condemns "inversion"—a <span style="font-style:italic;">fin-de-siecle</span> sexological term for queerness—and thereby the novel's queer characters. Giles specifically targets William Dodge, a man whom Woolf refuses to taxonomize as homosexual but whom Giles thinks of as a "perversion" and who is elsewhere described (sometimes self-described) as a "half-breed" , "a toady" , a "half-man," and "a flickering, mind-divided little snake in the grass" . Woolf in fact denies her characters the ability to name Dodge's "perversion" by anything other than these bestial labels , a fact that coincides with Stephen Barber's claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> "stages a deliberate resistance to regulatory procedures of labeling homosexuality by giving the name 'Dodge' [. . .] to a gay character" ("Lip-Reading: Woolf's Secret Encounters," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction</span>, ed. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997], 401-443, 403). Further buttressing Barber's claim, Woolf changed a sentence about Dodge in the early typescript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span> from "Can you condemn people for their sexuality?" to "Can you condemn people for the way they feel?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 81). Rejecting the identitarian terms on which sexuality has been regulated and condemned since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Woolf prefers to think of sex in terms of mutable affectional states rather than any particular taxonomic "sexuality."</p></div>

For helpful examinations of modernist conflations of women with a passive conception of nature that resonates in contemporary critical theory, see Grosz, <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Travels</span>  and Rita Felski's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernity</span> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995; 38-9).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f53" href="#f53-text">53. </a>Although this phrase may seem to be a contradiction in anti-identitarian and identitarian terms, I mean "queer feminism" to be aligned with Woolf's own hybrid politics, that which acts on behalf of historical political outsiders, even as it anticipates a vision beyond the need for such political action. Woolf envisions, as Grosz describes, a feminist theory that engages "the struggle to render more mobile, fluid, and transformable the means by which the female subject is produced and represented" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time Travels</span>, 193).</p></div>

Robert Hullot-Kentor (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997), 71, 62-3; hereafter abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">AT</span>. Adorno claims that art that has a "feeling for nature" does not master nature rationally but temporarily suspends its inevitable loss in the polymorphous realm of historical feeling . Indeed, Adorno, like Darwin, posits that that which derives from nature, "purportedly ahistorical, is at its core historical" . Art's feeling for nature—the suspension of loss, what Woolf might call a moment of concentration—is therefore, in Adorno's view, "all the more compelling for its ephemeralness": it is, like camp, both hopeful and sorrowful at once .</p></div>

This sentiment is not actually new to Woolf, though it might be newly expressed in her fiction of this era. In a book review as early as 1918, after all, Woolf writes, "Perhaps it is coarseness—the quality that is the most difficult of all for the educated to come by—that is lacking. By coarseness we mean something as far removed from vulgarity as can be. We mean something vehement, full-throated, carrying down in its rush sticks and stones and fragments of human nature pell-mell" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Writers</span> [New York: Mariner, 1976], 89).</p></div>

The most precise—yet still tentative ("appears")—origin of not only the species <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sapiens</span> but the "whole vertebrate kingdom" is thus a queer body, a body that vacillates between binary Victorian constructions of sex. Accordingly, Darwin claims in his theory of reversion that even gender differences bear the mark of undifferentiated similarities between gendered bodies, for all reproductive systems contain "a part which is always present and efficient in the one sex, being represented in the other by a mere rudiment," as in the case of mammary glands and homologous constructions like the uterus and vesicula (<span style="font-style:italic;">DOM</span>, 1: 30-1). Contradicting his rigid schema of sexual selection, then, Darwin's theory of reversion posits that gender differences always bear the stamp of their undifferentiated origin.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f66" href="#f66-text">66. </a>Woolf elsewhere explicitly links women's self-aestheticization with Nazi politics. In "Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid," Woolf writes that "the subconscious Hitlerism that holds us down is the desire for aggression; the desire to dominate and enslave. Even in the darkness we can see that made visible. We can see shop windows blazing; and women gazing; painted women; dressed-up women; women with crimson lips and crimson fingernails. They are slaves who are trying to enslave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 4: 174). Although one might balk at Woolf's comparison of window-shopping to fascism here, her interest in Darwinian science and Nazi politics at this time may explain how she conceives of women's inculcation into a cult of aesthetic beauty being tantamount to the supposedly civilized endeavors of Nazi domination.</p></div>

In her plans for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, for example, Woolf writes that the novel "should include satire, comedy, poetry, narrative, &amp; what form is to hold them all together? Should I bring in a play, letters, poems?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DVW</span>, 4: 152). In "Modern Novels," similarly, Woolf envisions the possibility of creating "a vague general confusion in which the clear-cut features of the tragic, the comic, the passionate, and the lyrical were dissolved beyond the possibility of separate recognition" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 3: 33). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f74" href="#f74-text">74. </a>Woolf deems Austen "the most perfect artist among women" and arguably envisions herself as Austen's torchbearer (<span style="font-style:italic;">Common Reader</span>, 206). In a 1918 review, after all, Woolf writes that "the capacity to criticize the other sex had its share in deciding women to write novels, for indeed that particular vein of comedy has been but slightly worked, and promises great richness," a promise she seems to hold for herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Writers</span>, 26-7). One of the predictions she makes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Room</span>, in fact, is that, should women have the resources to write, "comedy is bound to be enriched" . Although she rejected an invitation by the "the Womens Institute" to "write a play for the villagers to act. And to produce it myself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span>, 6: 391) while she was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Between</span>, the novel itself functions as a kind of play suitable, in its feminist inclinations, for that institute.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f75" href="#f75-text">75. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 60) Woolf extends the essay's sentiments elsewhere when she claims that "humour, after all, is closely bound up with a sense of the body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Common Reader</span>, 57) and that "the book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that women's books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ROO</span>, 78).</p></div>

<p>Modernist studies has been deeply enriched by the archival impulse that has lead critics to emphasize the material culture of modernism as a phenomenon that circulated in little magazines and limited editions, and then crossed over into mass and middlebrow mediums.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Pulp magazines, with the exception of the noir breeding ground <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Mask</span>, have not been included as significant participants in the material culture of modernism. Indeed the pulps' open courting of a mass market, their status as cultural artifacts that seem specially marked out for ephemerality, and their emphasis on satisfying readers' demands all provide clearly marked grounds for drawing a stark distinction between the pulps and modernist little magazines. Following Mark Morrisson's suggestion that the "contamination anxiety" theory of the modernist response to mass culture oversimplifies a complex set of engagements, I propose viewing the "contaminated" medium of the pulps as an alternative site for working out concerns about cultural integrity, the politics of representation, and access to a literary tradition that also run through more recognized venues for modernist writing.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In modernist studies, the adjective pulp has come to be synonymous with the hard-boiled noir, leading Paula Rabinowitz to theorize noir as America's pulp modernism.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Studies of detective pulps have effectively bridged the "great divide" between modernism and mass culture.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> In the process, however, the broad range of pulp writing has been effaced. In the spirit of literary recovery championed by Cary Nelson in modernist poetry, I suggest broadening modernist studies' engagement with pulp fiction.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Within the wide range of pulp styles, the blend of fantasy, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  science fiction, and horror referred to by its practitioners as weird fiction and most associated with the pulp magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> during the years between 1923 and 1940 offers an especially useful contrast to the detective pulps. While I focus on H. P. Lovecraft, the most recognized of the writers from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group as evidenced by the publication of a collection of his work by the Library of America in 2005, I emphasize his participation in a network of writers that includes lesser known names and his work as a ghostwriter for writers whose names have long been forgotten. In these pulp fictions of fantastic cultural contact some unexpected topics arise. My primary interest is to show how questions arising from the elaboration of the modernist culture concept in the rarified circles of academic communities and modernist aesthetic circles work their way into popular culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Lovecraft's work sheds an especially strange light on the status of the archive, a crucial component of both new modernist studies and modernist cultural production.</p>
<p>My discussion has four major components. Firstly, I suggest that the temporality of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> archive can enrich our understanding of what is at stake in the archival turn. Secondly, I show that Lovecraft uses techniques from ethnography and antiquarianism to produce both a model of culture and a fantastic universe that draws its claims to verisimilitude by means of a strategic practice of citation. Thirdly, I illustrate how Lovecraft's investment in two different modes of cultural collection (ethnography and antiquarianism) shapes his worldview. Lovecraft effectively negotiates between two different and opposed archives: an antiquarian trove of the familiar and reassuring and a pseudo-ethnographic one of the different and horrifying. Fourthly and finally, I read Lovecraft's "The Shadow Out of Time" as a textual site in which all of these concerns come together in a horrific tale of the archive. In Lovecraft's weird fiction I find a distorted "archive story" that both illustrates the crucial importance of cultural archives in the modernist moment and offers a cautionary tale for contemporary scholars working in the archive.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The archive comes alive in this weird story, reaching forward in time to act on those who attempt to use it. Through this image of an archive possessed of disturbing agency, Lovecraft's work challenges the tendency of high modernist writers to present themselves as authorities who control the archive and its meanings.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Weird Tales of the Archive</h1>
<p>One reason why modernist studies benefits so greatly from the turn to the archive is that so many major modernist texts construct themselves as archives by virtue of their citation of, allusion to, or direct invocation of texts running a broad gamut from contemporary to ancient, literary to scientific, erudite and elevated to banal and popular. These effects become even more pronounced when, for example, Marc Manganaro reads <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> against the model of culture presented by Edward Sapir, a contributor to the same famous 1922 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span> in which Eliot's poem first appeared.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Such effects bear witness to the hand of a meticulous editor constructing interwoven and carefully structured contents in each issue of the magazine, producing a document which is itself an intricate modernist object. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Such editorial care might be unexpected in pulp magazines; however, this would ignore how many of these publications fit Erin Smith's description of <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Mask</span> as "a pulp with pretensions."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Editors such as John W. Campbell at <span style="font-style:italic;">Astounding Stories</span> (later to become <span style="font-style:italic;">Astounding Science Fiction</span>), Hugo Gernsback at <span style="font-style:italic;">Amazing Stories</span>, and Farnsworth Wright at <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> all had recognizable house styles and made claims for their writers as an unrecognized vanguard. <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> wore its pretensions as a subtitle: "The Unique Magazine." This uniqueness most obviously refers to the as yet unconventional blending of styles that takes place in what would later be codified as horror fiction; however, it might also refer to the textual practices of citation, borrowing and ghostwriting that make each issue of the magazine a weird archive in itself. When I refer to the weirdness of this archive, I am referring to the uncanny temporalities both of the archives red in these pulp works and of the pulps as archives.</p>
<p>The writers associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> create an especially fascinating intertextual archive that seems at times to continue and at others to parody modernist fascinations with ethnographic depictions of difference and intertextual efforts at consolidating a cultural tradition. This archive provides a fun-house mirror-version of the modernist archive that provocatively reminds us that archives are uncanny things: collections of marks on paper that bear witness to the otherwise inaccessible thought processes of long-departed beings. In Lovecraft's work the reader encounters rations of archives that are fundamentally biased; here archives with which Lovecraft's Anglo-Saxon, New England-based, protagonists can identify are valuable and comforting while archives marked by any sign of difference are destructive and horrific. The imaginary nature of these archives could make them easy to dismiss as nothing more than the fantastic constructions of a virulent racist. I maintain, however, that they may be valuable resources for theorizing critical engagements with more tangible archives and the literary histories that they legitimate. Here I follow Marilyn Booth's suggestion that "To see fictional narrative as an alternative site of archival imagining simply highlights the shifting and suspect nature of the archive."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In Booth's analysis she follows the work of Roberto González Echevarría in treating fiction, and the novel in particular, as a form that "exposes . . . authoritative texts . . . as 'simulacra' of the authority to speak, to name."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Booth and González Echevarría work on Egyptian and Latin American literary traditions, respectively; contexts in which the national literature undermines the truth claims of colonial texts, and the archives against which these very different writers struggle is in both cases an official imperial construct. Lovecraft is obviously situated quite differently as he constructs himself as both a true representative of United States cultural authority and an heir to a British imperial tradition (he frequently claimed to identify most fully as an eighteenth-century Englishman).<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Lovecraft's status as a writer in a paraliterary genre, however, places him in a very different, but still oppositional relationship to official literary history.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Moreover, the reactionary ends to which Lovecraft directs his skeptical interaction with the idea of a stable or impartial archive offers a useful reminder that not all attacks on objectivity and scientific rationality lead to a libratory undermining of official discourse. Where T.S. Eliot and other conservative <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  custodians of literary tradition in the modernist moment place a preeminent value on the care for and guardianship over the archive, Lovecraft's use of the archive as a fiction fits less comfortably into narratives of modernist literary history.</p>
<p>Lovecraft's work, however, shares many modernist concerns, most significantly an investment in constructing and preserving tradition and an elaborate and idiosyncratic variation on the modernist culture concept. In both cases, Lovecraft's interests are shaped thoroughly by his antiquarian interest in Anglo-colonial folklore and his conviction that the twin encroaching forces of modernization and multiculturalism threatened this cultural tradition. This set of beliefs makes Lovecraft an easy fit into the survey of nativist modernism offered by Walter Benn Michaels.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Timothy Evans has recently argued for the centrality of Lovecraft's folkloric interests, as displayed in a lengthy series of travel writings, to an understanding of his frequent fictional evocations of the horror of lost or adulterated traditions.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Furthermore, although Lovecraft seems to have little or no sympathy for the literary endeavors of his high modernist contemporaries, he recognizes that many among them share his aversion to modernity.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>What I have called the weirdness of Lovecraft's modernism results from the peculiar temporality both of the pulps themselves and of the fictional archives and traditions referenced in <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span>. The practice of reprinting earlier writers who may be claimed as enabling ancestors for <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> writers and readers could simply be seen as an attempt to buttress the magazine's pretensions. The claim on a subscription form for the magazine that "If Poe were alive he undoubtedly would be a contributor to Weird Tales" both mobilizes the earlier writer as an ancestor and is interestingly silent about the reprinting practices which made Poe into a posthumous contributor to the magazine.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Indeed, Lovecraft's first contribution to <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span>, "Dagon," appears in the same October 1923 issue as the magazine's first Poe reprint, "The Pit and the Pendulum." While reprints are marked as such when they appear in an issue, readers, such as a contributor to the "Eyrie" in February 1928, who refers to H.G. Wells as a "<span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> writer," would not necessarily make a strict distinction between a reprint and an original.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> For Wells, whose work reprinted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> was originally published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Strand</span> and whose major novels were all reprinted by <span style="font-style:italic;">Amazing Stories</span>, to become a <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> writer requires a drastically revised account of his career. While it would be simple to use this as an example of the ignorance of pulp readers, it also speaks to the function of the pulps as aggregators of a vast range of cultural materials, which, by virtue of being bound between the same flimsy and luridly illustrated covers, are yoked together as participants in a shared aesthetic agenda. Through pulp practices of reprinting, textual artifacts of earlier eras gain an uncanny afterlife.</p>
<p>Given the prominence of reanimated corpses and collections of uncouth texts in the works by Lovecraft and his circle, it is hardly surprising that a member of that circle would write a story that works as an allegory for pulp practices of reprinting. In 1951 a story by Robert Bloch titled "The Man Who Collected Poe" appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Famous Fantastic Mysteries</span>, a pulp magazine that published both reprints of classic horror writers and original fiction. Bloch, the youngest member of the Lovecraft circle, was a prolific contributor to the circle's intertextual network. In addition to contributing his <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  own volume of pseudobiblia, he also engaged in an intertextual exchange with Lovecraft wherein each writer wrote a story dedicated to the other in which a fictionlized version of the other met a horrible end after reading pseudobiblia.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> "The Man Who Collected Poe" tells of the narrator's encounter with Launcelot Canning, the self-proclaimed "world's leading collector of the works of Edgar Allan Poe."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> As it turns out, this collection extends beyond rare editions and memorabilia to include, in a macabre twist, Poe's reanimated corpse. This story about a weird Poe archive, which appears in a magazine that had reprinted the nineteenth-century writer as an ancestor for authors of weird fiction, calls attention to the pulps' archival function. Bloch's collector reanimates Poe and makes him speak in another time. Similarly, the pulps repackaged earlier authors as enabling res for upstart, un-pedigreed genres and styles.</p>
<p>The interest of Bloch's story to a theorization of the archival roles of the pulps does not end with its literalization of the practices of reprinting. Another presence inhabits Bloch's story: the mad collector learns the arts that allow him to bring Poe's corpse to life by consulting a library of volumes of arcane lore. After learning the secret of Canning's Poe collection, the narrator notes for the first time the presence of books that were not authored by Poe on Canning's shelves:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Here was the Chiromancy of Robert Flud; the Directorium Inquisitorium, a rare and curious book in quarto Gothic that was the manual of a forgotten church; and betwixt and between the volumes of pseudo-scientific inquiry, theological speculation and sundry incunabula I found titles that arrested and appalled me. De Vermis Mysteriis and the Liber Eibon, treatises on demonology, on witchcraft, on sorcery, moldered in crumbling bindings. The books were old, the books were tattered and torn, but the books were not dusty. They had been read—.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The narrator's tour of Canning's library is a nod to the conventions of weird fiction, in which the horror of—in this case, a reanimated corpse—is partially routed through texts. The slow build-up in this passage to the revelation that these arcane texts "had been read" suggests that the act of reading forbidden lore is equivalently horrific to reanimating a corpse. This library also serves a complex archival function. The first two texts mentioned are existent books that are also referenced in Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher," the model for Bloch's story.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> The second two are pseudobiblia, the first being Bloch's creation and the second that of Clark Ashton Smith, another member of the Lovecraft circle. Placing his imaginary text alongside of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Liber Eibon</span> intertextually links Bloch and his story to works by the founders of weird pulp fiction. Although it is published in a different venue from the majority of the Lovecraft circle's work, the citations in the story construct intertextual links that move well beyond the flimsy covers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Famous Fantastic Mysteries</span>. The relative lateness of Bloch's story is also a useful reminder of the fluidity of pulp archives; when discussing pulp fiction it is especially difficult to draw hard and fast lines of periodization as successful pulp writers from the past are repackaged for later eras and contemporary writers continue to invoke pulp ancestors.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Moreover, Canning's possession of the texts mentioned in Poe's story suggests that at times the effort of "collecting Poe" requires the collection of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Poe's intertexts. This readerly desire to possess not only a writer's work, but also items that appear in that work, is crucial to the network of pulp pseudobiblia that emanates from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group. The network of textual transmission in which Bloch's story participates provides a tentative model for a reconceived theory of the pulp archive. The pulp archive deviates from more traditional archives in that it, like the corpse of Poe, remains productive after its death.</p>
<p>An example of the posthumous productivity of pulp archives that resonates closely with Bloch's story involves the posthumous publications of Lovecraft's work, some of which were almost entirely written by August Derleth from Lovecraft's notes or fragmentary drafts.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Pulp archives resist scholarly attention, as they tend to lack the kind of institutional standing that renders an archive official or legitimate.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> One of the specters haunting these archives, which distance them from the official archive even as it speaks to the repressed truth of all archives, is that of the obsessive fan or collector. The extent to which pulp archives are a direct function of desire raises a slew of scholarly red flags, not the least of which being the possibility that the organizer's desire might have motivated the removal of items from or addition of materials to the archive. Here we might see the pulp archive as a not-yet-mystified version of the official archive. As Burton puts it: "If desire is in fact a crucial constituent of the archive experience, discourses of rationalization—of archive logics—have helped to obscure this dynamic at least since the nineteenth century."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> That this desire to alter the archive extends to professional academic users of archives is attested to by Burton's claim that, "More than one scholar has confessed to me a desire to take objects from the archive—a photo of Tito signed by Churchill, a nineteenth-century pencil dangling from a hand-written diary—and who knows how many others have actually done so."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The combination of the dubious reliability of pulp archives and their lack of pedigree makes them easy to pass over. Within the pulp archive, however, we find a strange presence that complicates the criteria defining a good archive as a base for scholarly knowledge production. Lovecraft's work in particular troubles and potentially undermines the scholarly conventions of ethnography.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Pseudobiblia and Paratextual Cultures</h1>
<p>At first glance, the proposition that purposefully "weird" fiction may be compared to ethnography might seem far-fetched. After all, ethnography gains its claim to validity through a scientific textual apparatus that documents the existence of the peoples being studied. Moreover, ethnographic representation actively seeks to avoid playing up the element of the "weird," or, as Bronislaw Malinowski puts it, "Ethnology has introduced law and order into what seemed chaotic and freakish."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Weird fiction, on the other hand, would seem to flout any such claim to verisimilitude by virtue of its inherent commitment to that which is chaotic and freakish. But it is commonplace, indeed conventional, for works of genre fiction to provide a pseudo-ethnographic apparatus (the paradigmatic example remains Tolkein's elaborate catalogues of the linguistic, geographic, and historical minutia of Middle Earth). In his introduction to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a study of the history of fantasy writing, Lin Carter offers the following story of the origin for such pseudo-ethnographic paratexts:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>E. R. Eddison, the British romancer of the 1920s . . . revolutionized fantasy by bringing in documentation . . . it was Eddison who buttressed his romances with firm chronological tables and detailed, seemingly realistic maps—imagined historical dates, to be sure, and invented geographies, of course: but they <span style="font-style:italic;">looked real</span>.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<div class="leftcolumn"><p>This introduction of documentation into fantastic texts occurs simultaneously with the incorporation of documentary photographs, maps, and tables attesting to the ethnographer's presence in the field in the new ethnographies being produced by Malinowski, Franz Boas, and their followers.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Whether or not Eddison was motivated by a conscious desire to mimic the ethnographic textual apparatus, the establishment of such an apparatus within a self-consciously scientific field could only enhance the reality effect to which Carter refers.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p></div>
<p>As Lovecraft published almost exclusively in the medium of the pulps, presenting such a paratextual apparatus as an appendix to his work was not a viable option. Since illustrations and editing decisions at the pulps were routinely made without consulting the authors, the publication of such an apparatus would be an unlikely event indeed. This did not, however, keep Lovecraft from cultivating a reality effect in his own fiction. He produces such an effect through a careful and inventive process of textual citation. A Lovecraft story will commonly include within it citations of real scholarship (particular favorites were J. G. Frazer and Samuel Adams Drake) alongside of citations of purely fictitious authorities.</p>
<p>The spurious authorities that make up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> groups' archive of pseudobiblia owe their existence to a carefully managed practice of intertextual citation that occurred within the pages of the pulps. Authors such as Lovecraft, Smith, Derleth, Bloch, and Robert E. Howard invented authoritative texts for the occult traditions that served as sources of horror in many of their stories. References to Lovecraft's <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>, Smith's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Eibon</span>, Derleth's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cultes des Goules</span>, Bloch's <span style="font-style:italic;">De Vermis Mysteriis</span>, and Howard's <span style="font-style:italic;">Unaussprechlichen Kulten</span>, and many others, appear not only in each author's own stories, but also crop up in the works of other members of the group and in tales ghostwritten or revised by the group members for paying clients (Lovecraft was especially active in revising and ghostwriting). As Lovecraft confided in a letter in relation to other authors' uses of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>, "I like to have other authors in the gang [i.e. fellow contributors to <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span>] allude to it, for it helps work up a background of evil verisimilitude."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In the stories, these imaginary texts are frequently found shelved in fictional libraries alongside of extant occult documents and ethnographic studies of witchcraft and voodoo, heightening the reality effect. In other places, Lovecraft compares his writing to the narratives of confidence men and "crooked witnesses," claiming that they all share a similar goal, in his words, "to 'put across' a deception."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The imaginary archive of weird texts projected by these practices of citing pseudobiblia simultaneously constructs a literary tradition (of hoaxes) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  while also parodying the academic methodology through which such traditions are consolidated.</p>
<p>Knowing that their stories would appear next to one another and be read by the same readers, Lovecraft and his friends play on the physical form of the pulp magazine, to produce a dense network of citations referring back to their invented texts. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>, as the first of these pseudobiblia, provides a model for the later horrible texts and authorizes them as the new imaginary texts can be compared and related to it. In many cases, other members of the Lovecraft circle use the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span> to provide a sort of horror by association for their own volumes. Thus Clark Ashton Smith's <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of Eibon</span> gains horrific status when a character discovers in his comparison of Smith's and Lovecraft's pseudobiblia "many correspondences of the blackest and most appalling significance, together with much forbidden data that was either unknown to the Arab [the fictional author of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>] or omitted by him . . . or by his translators."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> While the reader of <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> obviously cannot engage in such a comparative analysis of these non-existent volumes, he or she can go through back issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> seeking out references to this esoteric knowledge. For the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group, then, the magazine is both an integral part of their compositions and an archive for their imagined worlds.</p>
<p>This archive opened up new avenues of interconnection, as fans sought out connections between different authors' mythic res. One fan, for example, inquired about the possibility of a connection between Lovecraft's Cthulu and Howard's Kathulos, inspiring Lovecraft to treat the two res, originally the independent conceptualizations of their respective authors, as variant accounts of the same supernatural entity.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> This example of unintentional intertextuality, and Lovecraft's decision to embrace this conflation, provides another reminder of the extreme flexibility of the pulp archive. In this venue a misreading that creates a likeness between two different res from two different fictitious mythologies paradoxically can be marshaled to further enhance the putative reality of each. As in new media, in the pulp archive the generation of intertextual links confers authority.</p>
<p>Kathulos appears in Howard's "Skull Face," serialized in <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> from October to December 1929. Cthulu debuted in Feburary 1928 in "The Call of Cthulu." On the face of it, these seem like two entirely distinct entities. Howard's Kathulos is a humanoid sorcerer from Atlantis who has been preserved through mummification for unspecified eons. Lovecraft's Cthulu, on the other hand, is rigorously non-humanoid to the extent of defying description. The most confident assertion about the form of Cthulu and the other "Great Old Ones" in "The Call of Cthulu" is that "they had shape . . . but that shape was not made of matter."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Just as the appearance of Lovecraft's Cthulu defies description, there is no clear sense of what a world dominated by Cthulu and the Old Ones would look like except that "the liberated Old Ones would teach them [worshipers of the Old Ones] new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom" ("Cthulu," 183). By contrast Kathulos has a tangible aim of establishing "a black empire, with himself as emperor of the world!"<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Other than consonance, these two res are united by one other shared trait: both pursue their nefarious plans by using webs of human followers. To achieve Kathulos's "black empire," "he has banded together in one monstrous conspiracy the black, the brown, and the yellow" ("Skull Face," 257). The members of the Cthulu cult are also racial others, although like the entity they worship, their otherness is less easily pinned down. They are an "indescribable horde of human abnormality," hybrid spawn," "mongrel celebrants," and, most concretely, "men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type" (:Cthulu," 180-1). Howard's "monstrous conspiracy," like the hybrid bodies of Lovecraft's Cthulu cultists, gathers its monstrosity from its capacity to bring together races, indeed the British secret agent who investigates Kathulos's conspiracy is especially taken aback by the "power that Kathulos has that draws together black men and yellow men to serve him—that unites world-old foes" ("Skull Face," 263). It seems, then, that the anonymous correspondent's conflation of Cthulu and Kathulos can be justified as both res stand in for a vague sense that multicultural modernity is a sinister conspiracy hostile to the white Western tradition that both Howard and Lovecraft hold dear. In the pulp archive, these cognate res can become the same re and this re attains an even more authoritative stature because it is present in multiple invented mythological systems that readers may access via a single subscription.</p>
<p>This practice of intertextuality, with its careful attention both to paratextual apparatus like the letters page and to imaginary intertexts, calls attention to one of the distinguishing characteristics of the archive. As anyone who has processed manuscript collections can tell you, the arrangement of items in an archive is as, if not more, important than the content of those items.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The intertextual practices of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group produce an archive that suggests, by virtue of its arrangement, the existence of another paratextual archive of pseudobiblia. This archive, if it can be said to exist at all, exists only as a series of citations, as a network of titles that have no content whatsoever. Confronted with this strange archive, Walter Benjamin's observation that "if there is a counterpart to the confusion of a library, it is the order of its catalogue" comes to mind, as this paratextual archive does away with the need for a material library, leaving only a list of titles for the reader to organize into a catalogue.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> An immaterial archive is either a pure archive (all arrangement and no content, the neatness of a finding aid without the messiness of manuscripts) or a parody of archives.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Creating such an immaterial archive produces what could be called an archive effect that preserves the feeling of referring to tangible sources in a gesture that actually points to a space that is purely imaginary. Considering that even public archives are relatively inaccessible, the cultivation of the archive effect reduces the technique of legitimization through intertextual citation to a merely textual device.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of Lovecraft's enduring antipathy to T.S. Eliot (he wrote a parody of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Paper</span>), it is tempting to see his participation in the fabrication of such an intertextual network as a parody of the dense tissues of intertextuality that characterize Eliot's poem. Indeed, Lovecraft at times seems to see his work as a veiled critique of modernist theories of culture. In an especially manic letter, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Lovecraft makes recourse to uncertainty theory and relativity to claim that his Cthulu mythos and Eliot's philosophy of culture have an equal probability of being "'esoterically true'" although, in his case, "its creator . . . invented it in jest or fiction."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Thus part of the payoff of theorizing pulp archives comes from the distorted version of the archival and the scholarly that they provide. Where Eliot constructs in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" a model of literary tradition that exists in an ideal realm and which is dynamically altered by each new addition to it, Lovecraft goes a step further to produce a non-existent tradition of occult writing that is altered any time a member of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group invents a new addition to this canon of pseudobiblia.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Thus Lovecraft's imaginary tradition ironically reveals the element of invention that goes into the production of any tradition.</p>
<p>Lovecraft's intertextual citation of imaginary authorities on non-existent folkloric traditions also inverts and ironizes the working method of actual ethnographers. Ethnographic texts stand as second-order representations of actually existing cultures. Lovecraft's <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>, on the other hand, exists only through citations, and the tradition it is said to document exists only as the fictional subject matter of a fictional text. This did not, however, stop Lovecraft from writing "The History of the Necronomicon," a detailed account of the composition, reception history, and translations of the imaginary volume, which he followed carefully in his references to the work to ensure the internal coherence of his paratextual world. Indeed, Lovecraft saw such an attention to the details of his impossible creations as the defining feature of his work:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Inconceivable events and conditions have a special handicap to overcome, and this can be accomplished only through the maintenance of a careful realism in every phase of the story <span style="font-style:italic;">except</span> that touching on the one given marvel.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is my contention that in order to craft this "careful realism" Lovecraft directly appropriated aspects of the style and methodology of ethnography, seeking to provide a fictional version of Malinowski's ethnographic "law and order" to the creatures of his "freakish and chaotic" imagination.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Such an endeavor of drawing structural homologies between divergent materials is not without precedent in ethnography; Ruth Benedict's <span style="font-style:italic;">Patterns of Culture</span> deploys the dramatically different cultures of the Zuñi, Dobu, and Kwakiutl to demonstrate her claim that "culture . . . is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Where Benedict provides a framework in which different cultural extremes may be comprehensible, Lovecraft uses such a framework to make the fantastic seem real.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Eldritch Horror of Ethnography</h1>
<p>This is not to suggest that the horrible aliens that fill Lovecraft's fiction are derived only from his imagination. In fact, Lovecraft's epistolary descriptions of the plight of living in a nation beset by growing tides of immigration resonate tellingly with his tales of fictional horrors encroaching on mundane reality. Lovecraft's correspondence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  during the period in which he lived in New York City offers an especially rich field for such an analysis.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> The horror that Lovecraft felt in encounters with those whom he believed to be racially and culturally alien to him is expressed emphatically in the following lament:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[T]here [in New York] the problem assumes its most hideous form as loathsome Asiatic hordes trail their dirty carcasses over streets where white men once moved, and air their odious presence and twisted visages and stunted forms till we shall be driven either to murder them or emigrate ourselves, or be carried shrieking to the madhouse. . . . It is not good for a proud, light-skinned Nordic to be cast away alone amongst squat, squint-eyed jabberers with coarse ways and alien emotions whom his deepest cell-tissue hates and loathes as the mammal hates and loathes the reptile, with an instinct as old as history . . . <sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The sheer linguistic overload of this description, its flood of demeaning adjectives that move beyond the dry clichés of stereotypes into the excesses of passionate racism, would fit perfectly into one of Lovecraft's tales. Moreover, Lovecraft's sense of the absolute difference, coded in his metaphor relating relationships between peoples to an imagined antipathy between classes of vertebrates, that separates himself, the "proud light-skinned Nordic" from the "loathsome Asiatic hordes," reappears in his fiction when his characters encounter creatures so alien that seeing them drives men mad, if not to death. A passage from "The Call of Cthulu," written later in 1926 after Lovecraft's return to Rhode Island, resonates especially strongly:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing can not be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. . . . The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awakened to claim his own.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Cthulu," 194)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Note that the author of the account possesses a Nordic surname, and that the fantastic alien contradicts not only the narrowly held values of Nordic men but of everything that subtends human existence. In short, this is the terror of the inassimilable other carried to its hyperbolic conclusion.</p>
<p>Lovecraft's loathing of his fellow inhabitants of Brooklyn is not always displaced onto the fantastically inhuman bodies of his most famous creations like Cthulu. In "The Horror at Red Hook," the monster is the immigrant population of Red Hook, Brooklyn. Lovecraft describes this population as "a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian, Spanish, Italian, and negro elements impinging upon one another, and fragments of Scandinavian and American belts lying not far distant. It is a babel of sound and filth, and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the harbor whistles."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> This description concentrates Lovecraft's fear of miscegenation (the "hopeless tangle," "babel of sound and filth"), and his visceral repulsion from modernity as symbolized by the shipping infrastructure <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of the Red Hook piers. The brief flash of industrial shipping that is suggested by these oily waves, grimy piers, and monstrous harbor whistles receives an implicit critique in the sentences that directly follow, in which the narrator hearkens back to an earlier time in which "a brighter picture dwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets" ("Red Hook," 128). The narrator proceeds to "trace the relics of this former happiness" by giving the reader a brief antiquarian tour of the surviving marks that were left by the past inhabitants of Red Hook.</p>
<p>This antiquarian departure, as well as the frame narrative of the story which places the protagonist safely in the more homogenous climes of village life in Rhode Island, clearly instantiates a differentiation between a valued and imperiled past of ethnic solidarity and a dreaded but irresistible future of miscegenation red by "the polyglot abyss of New York's underworld" ("Red Hook," 127). The antiquarian Lovecraft manifests himself in the narrator's comments. This collector also has an anti-type who makes a brief appearance in the narrator's description of the story's protagonist, the New York City police detective Thomas Malone:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>He was conscious, as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge, that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive half-ape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist's shudder the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the small hours of the morning.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Red Hook," 129)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In this narrative, the antiquarian is pleased and soothed by his discoveries while the anthropologist's relationship to his subject matter is summed up in a characteristic "shudder." Along these lines, we might say that Lovecraft has elaborated two distinct affective modalities of cultural collection: one personified by the happy antiquarian and one personified by the shuddering anthropologist. Inasmuch as anthropology, in the passage above, is associated loosely with collecting the fruits of cross-cultural contact in the present and antiquarianism with intracultural artifacts from the past, we might also lay out two models of the textual archive produced by such endeavors: the latter produces therapeutic reminders of one's proper place in time and space, while the former yields catalogues of horrific and absolute otherness.</p>
<p>Lovecraft's folkloric interests can shed light once more on the cultural dynamics at work in his terror of contact across difference. It is crucial to remark here that the folkloric traditions that Lovecraft was attracted to share one common trait: they were elements of the "culture stream" that he claimed as his own. Therefore, to properly understand Lovecraft's investment in ethnography, we must be careful to distinguish between ethnographies that focus on sameness and those that focus on otherness. For Lovecraft, rational, scientific representation is only proper when the subject matter is the familiar. When the subject matter derives from a foreign culture, in fact, Lovecraft maintains that such a pose is actively misleading in its implication that such material could or should be relevant to a member of another culture. He frequently criticizes such attempts at intercultural comprehension as empty language games in which the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  participants fool themselves into believing that an expression retains its meaning when lifted out of its cultural context. Indeed, he suggests that curiosity about other cultures is itself a weakness:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Nothing but <span style="font-style:italic;">artificial sentiment</span>, of a thin, unreal sort insufficient to hold any but a few imaginative individuals like you or me, could make any normal terrestrial Aryan care a hang about either Jupiter and Saturn's rings on the one hand, or Chinamen and negroes on the other hand. Nothing means anything vitally to us except something which we can interpret in the light of conditions we know.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">With the door thus closed on the possibility of representing the other as a potential participant in dialogue or any other kind of significant reciprocal exchange, Lovecraft's choice of horror as the dominant mode for representing the other can be seen as a purposefully estranging representational choice bent on correcting such "artificial sentiment."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> In addition to supporting his sense that the other is horrifically different, Lovecraft's attraction to these tales of absolute otherness reflects his philosophical conviction that the universe is hostile and resolutely non-anthropocentric.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lovecraft's absolute distinction between cultural materials that are familiar and therefore relevant and those that are unfamiliar and therefore ghastly informs his imagination of the archive. The kind of folkloric work that Lovecraft both admired and produced in his antiquarian writing functions as a textual archive of the reservoirs of anti-modern homeliness that he typically located in rural northern New England. Lovecraft's account of his first impression of Vermont offers a clear example of his sense of such spaces as threatened reservoirs of the past. After a typically hyperbolic execration of the "blight of mutation and modernity" that has tainted southern New England, Lovecraft offers the following account of his response to the Vermont landscape:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Only in the remoter backwoods can one find the pristine and ancestral beauty which was southern New England's, or the unmixed signs of continuous native life whose deep roots make it the one authentic outgrowth of the landscape. There are traces enough to allure and tantalize, but not enough to satisfy. With our keenest pleasure and satisfaction is mixed a certain melancholy; for it is upon the ghost of something beloved and departed, rather than upon the thing itself, that we gaze. Our own country and history seem subtly dissolving away from us, and we clutch frantically at the straws and symbols through which our imaginations may momentarily recall and recapture a past which is really our own.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The geographic archive of Vermont provides Lovecraft with an anti-type for the monstrous textual archives that proliferate in his stories. This construction of a regional space reads like an application of the techniques of salvage ethnography in the service of a nativist convinced by the doom-saying of books like Lothrop Stoddard's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rising Tide of Color</span>  and Madison Grant's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passing of the Great Race</span> .</p>
<p>The idea of a horrible text that would archive unspeakable otherness is commonplace in both Lovecraft's published work and his sketches and ideas for unwritten stories.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> This trope is hardly original to Lovecraft. His frequent mentions of Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Portrait of Dorian Grey</span> and effusive praise for Arthur Machen in his correspondence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  suggests a source for Lovecraft's hideous texts in the fatal book of turn-of-the-century decadence and aestheticism.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Lovecraft's image of the horrific book is a distillation of the alienness of both the immigrants that repelled him and the creatures of his imagination that populate his stories. Indeed, in "The Horror at Red Hook" the protagonist realizes that he cannot act on his literary ambitions and narrate his experience: "The horror . . . could not make a story—for like the book cited by Poe's German authority, '<span style="font-style:italic;">er lässt sich nicht lessen—</span>it does not permit itself to be read'" ("Red Hook," 127). Not only is this imaginary text unreadable, but, in a typically Lovecraftian twist, it is intertextually unreadable as it joins the "Hortulus Animæ" invoked by the narrator of Poe's "The Man of the Crowd" at both the beginning and ending of the tale. In Poe's story, however, the unreadable text stands as a metaphor for the unapproachable story of the inner workings of the titular man of the crowd as the story ends with the following sentence: "The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Animæ,' and perhaps it is but one of great mercies of God that '<span style="font-style:italic;">er lasst sich nicht lessen</span>.'"<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Lovecraft eschews such a ral relationship; in his work someone inevitably reads that which should not be read, and his story recounts the very events that the narrator deems unreadable. This makes "The Horror at Red Hook" a tale destined to disappoint, and its ensuing revelation of a fantastic ring of illegal immigrants celebrating demonic rites in catacombs beneath the city streets is only intolerable as a result of its frank and unrepentant racism.</p>
<p>This is not a mistake that Lovecraft repeats; he tends to be careful to keep that which should not be read carefully disguised, typically by invoking his books of forbidden lore through their titles or brief excerpts and later dramatizing the effects of consuming them. The citations of, and references to, Lovecraft's pseudobiblia become more and more glancing as his career continues; in his later works he frequently stops at indicating that a character is familiar with selected volumes from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group's canon of pseudobiblia. In "The Call of Cthulhu" Lovecraft provides a tantalizing glimpse of the Necronomicon:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much discussed couplet:</p>
<p>"That is not dead which can eternal lie,</p>
<p>And with strange aeons even death may die."</p>
<div class="attrib">("Cthulu," 183)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This reference presents the reader less with a clear sense of the content of this arcane text than with the effect that these contents are the subject of occult debate taking place in circles unknown or inaccessible to the reader of <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span>. At one level, the result is a kind of negative intertextuality: the titles of these books lead literally nowhere. These books are not vehicles of expression but alien, unapproachable things. On another level, however, this passing reference to an inaccessible world of textual debate resonates tellingly with references to modernist writing in the popular press.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> The pseudobibliographical archive is constituted by these intertextual references and these references induct the reader into a truly <span style="font-style:italic;">imagined</span> community of commentators and interpreters of this archive. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Weirdness of Being Archived</h1>
<p>Near the end of his career, Lovecraft adds a new wrinkle to his established theme of working with horrific texts. While texts such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span> are terrible because of their sheer otherness, in "The Shadow Out of Time" (first published in 1936 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Astounding Science Fiction</span>) Lovecraft attempts to imbue what would seem to be a completely innocent textual artifact with a similar kind of loathsome difference. In this story the most important horrible library does not compile the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group's usual volumes, but instead a set of handwritten depictions of Earth authored by its inhabitants. Following the logic that underpins Lovecraft's distinction between the anthropologist's shudder and the peace of the antiquarian, such a collection should be a homely thing for those who participated in writing it. Through a series of complex displacements, Lovecraft makes the narrator's experience of recognizing his own handwriting a scene of profound alienation.</p>
<p>"The Shadow Out of Time" tells the story of a New England academic, Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, who falls prey to an elaborate scheme by which an alien intelligence from far in the past, referred to as the "Great Race," takes possession of his body while transferring the professor's consciousness backward in time into the body of his possessor. I read this scenario as a nightmare vision of ethnographic fieldwork. Instead of simply taking up residence within the culture, Lovecraft's inhuman participant observers take over bodies in order to sate their desire for knowledge of a world that is not only culturally different, but also hugely temporally distant from their own reality.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> The vast temporal distance that separates the members of the "Great Race" from the narrative present of the human world, compounded with the gross physiological difference between the races (the Great Race have conical bodies, tentacle like appendages, and three eyes set in an antennae-laden head), produces a fantastic version of the hyperbolic difference that, in Lovecraft's mind, separated him from the immigrant population of Brooklyn. In this context, the Great Race's desire to acquire knowledge produces revulsion, not enlightenment; even the books that Peaslee reads during his displacement are horrific:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>There were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes, and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes. There were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts, and frightful chronicles of grotesque-bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Shadow," 744)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The terrible nature of the experience of reading these texts results partially from the strangeness of the worlds they describe and from the diminished sense of the significance of human experience within this vast library that spans time and space. The physicality of the above description, especially the reference to "grotesque bodied intelligences," offers a key to Lovecraft's sense of this horror. Reading these texts seems analogous to the narrator's predicament as he reads: being trapped in an alien body. Reading ethnography of the other thus threatens a sense of familiar, stable embodiment.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This tale is especially interesting to discussions of early ethnography as a striking fictional account of the predicament of becoming an object of ethnographic analysis. Without making a case for Lovecraft as a prescient critic of ethnographic methodology, I wish to consider the aspects of ethnographic endeavor that his narrative mobilizes for its horrific effect. The Great Race takes pains to ensure that the flow of information produced by the displacement of the consciousness of the studied being is strictly one-way: the displaced being's memory is erased before it is returned to its own body, ensuring that the Great Race is the only one to profit both from the endeavors of the participant observer in the future and from the autoethnographic writings of the displaced being. This strategy of physical possession of the ethnographic object at once literalizes the idea that ethnographers are subject to the temptation of going native and shuts down any possibility of reciprocal exchange. All knowledge is the property of the ethnographer and the ethnographic object is literally dispossessed of his/her personal history. The superior technological ability of the Great Race thus allows them to act out a pernicious assumption regarding the knowledge produced by early fieldwork.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Or so they think. In Lovecraft's story something has clearly gone wrong. The subject returns to his body to find himself haunted by dreams and "pseudomemories" in which he is in a loathsome body, in a strange place with alien architecture, and possessed of knowledge of a world far beyond the scope of human experience.</p>
<p>At this point, Lovecraft's narrative could be read as an allegory of the transformative force of ethnographic contact. Despite the utmost efforts of the ethnographer to preserve the integrity of the observed culture, contact leaves its marks, just as Peaslee's artificially suppressed memories return as dreams. However, this interpretation is exactly what the narrator seeks to avoid. The middle section of the story is largely taken up with Peaslee's attempts to provide a psychological explanation for his "pseudomemories." In this narrative, Peaslee simply suffered from a mental break during which he became obsessed with occult research. After a while his sanity returned and he forgot the material he studied during this episode only to have it return to him in his dreams. This psychological explanation is a "saving influence" as it protects Peaslee from a sense of his, and humanity's, absolute vulnerability to the machinations of the Great Race ("Shadow," 753). It is telling that upon his resumption of "a very normal life of work and recreation" Peaslee begins writing a series of academic articles for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Psychological Society</span> that describes his experience ("Shadow," 753). Refusing the position of the object of knowledge, the narrator turns to scholarly discourse to author an interpretation in which the meanings of his experience begin and end within his psyche. Through disciplinary rigor, Peaslee is able to transform these disturbing memories. He transmutes his personal horrific archive of the other into a reassuring archive of the self.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> The loss of this subject position provides the final twist of Lovecraft's tale.</p>
<p>After having been informed that rocks bearing inscriptions similar to those described in his articles have been located in Australia, Peaslee leads a dig at the site and the stage is set for the final horrific encounter of the tale, in which he discovers the volume of autoethnography that he wrote for the Great Race in the ruins of their library: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>No eye had seen, no hand had touched that book since the advent of man to this planet. And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in that frightful abyss, I saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-browned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of the earth's youth. They were, instead, the letters of our familiar alphabet, spelling out the words of the English language in my own handwriting.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Shadow," 783)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This is the end of Lovecraft's story. In comparison with his other works, which often leave the reader confronting an alien horrific being, it seems relatively benign. When viewed, however, in the context of Lovecraft's folkloric aesthetics of identity, this ending takes on additional disruptive significance. A document that should stand as a confirmation of Peaslee's place within his particular "culture stream" instead becomes proof of his commerce with, and possession by, the other. This, for Lovecraft, is the horror of ethnography: that a code of writing has come into existence that potentially can be manipulated to make one "culture stream" the property of another. Here Lovecraft translates the eugenic fear of contamination manifested in his descriptions of New York City into a larger allegory of the limits of cross-cultural representation.</p>
<p>The tableau that the text closes with, in which Peaslee gazes at the text that confirms his status as an ethnographic object, strikes me as an especially sophisticated ironization of a central trope of ethnography, the reciprocal gaze. For modernist ethnographers it was crucial that the reader identify with the ethnographer's perspective on the natives and become the object of perception from the native point of view, an experience that purposefully disrupts an aesthetics of similarity.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Peaslee's encounter with the text that he authored for the Great Race's archives alters this cultural logic, making the Westerner the object who recognizes his own captivity in the familiarity of the cultural forms that have been appropriated as the ethnographer's knowledge. In this scenario ethnographic documents do not enhance cultural understanding; instead they exacerbate Peaslee's alienation by reminding him of the radical contingency of the social and political forces that subtend his particular version of Western, modern, rational subjectivity. This potential contingency of the power and knowledge that affirm Peaslee's existence is the final horror of multicultural modernity in Lovecraft's fiction.</p>
<p>The contents of Peasley's autoethnography, like those of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span> and its analogues, are of secondary, if any, importance to the overall narrative. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group's mock archives do not, however, remain devoid of content. It seems that as soon as a fake volume was referred to in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span>, fans began attempting to extrapolate the subject matter of these texts from the authors' purposefully cryptic references. Members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> group typically were quite forthcoming about the fictional nature of their pseudobiblia when fans inquired about the volumes' availability in correspondence. However, they also continued to build on the cherished air of verisimilitude that surrounded these ersatz documents, occasionally producing accounts of the histories of the texts and cultures that the texts purported to document. Characteristically, the most detailed of the authorial contributions is Lovecraft's self-proclaimed mock erudite "History of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>" (written in 1927, posthumously published in 1938). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This history is worth dwelling on for a moment. It provides an elaborate account of the transmission of this document including its composition by "Abdul Alhazred, a mad poet of Sanaá, in Yemen" under its original title <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Azif</span>, its translations into Greek, Latin, and English, and its later reception including a printing history, a list of extant copies, and a fictitious papal ban of the volume.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Even the name that Lovecraft gives to the author of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span> adds another wrinkle to the strangeness of this archive. According to Lovecraft this name originated as "a favorite dream-character of mine—indeed that is what I used to call myself when I was five years old and a transported devotee of Andrew Lang's version of the Arabian Nights."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> Thus, Lovecraft, or at least his dream self, <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> the author of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicon</span>, even though, as he puts it, the text is "something which must yet be written in order to possess objective reality."<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> Lovecraft's turn of phrase here, which calls attention to the possibility that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Necronomicon</span> might be written in the future, brings us once again to the most striking oddity of the weird archive: its tendency to grow posthumously.</p>
<p>When speaking of an archive, we commonly assume we are speaking historically about a collection of documents that bear witness to a past era. So what are we to make of an archive of texts that point toward their own possible future composition? In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Necronomicon</span> this question is not completely theoretical. Many university libraries now have catalogue entries for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Necronomicon</span> (although the books have not yet taken their places on the shelves). More to the point, no fewer than three different texts have been published under the title. While each falls short of providing the horrific knowledge promised by Lovecraft's original references, their material existence stands as evidence of the power of his citational method. The archive of imaginary books projected by these citations has now called into existence an archive of its own. That is to say, these hoax <span style="font-style:italic;">Necronomicons</span>, that are typically a mixture of earnest attempts at producing a spell book and painful efforts to emulate Lovecraft's purple prose, do not complete or close down this weird archive. Instead, they open new avenues of spectral afterlife for these ideas. Like the reanimated Poe in Bloch's story, trapped in a building modeled on the house of Usher and compelled to produce his posthumous work, the pseudobiblical archive produces its own afterlife while remaining at the mercy of obsessive fans.</p>
<p>Viewed in the context of recent theorizations of the archive, the temporality of this weird archive is only an extreme case that exposes the temporality of all archives. According to Carolyn Steedman, "The archive is a record of the past, at the same time as it points to the future. The grammatical tense of the archive is thus the future perfect, 'when it will have been.'"<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> This tour of a weird pulp archive offers a way to think about how contemporary negotiations with different modernist archives shape the future course of modernist studies.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>Lovecraft's conservative investment in tradition is hardly an idiosyncratic response to modernity.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>Lovecraft's antipathy to the modernist projects of contemporaries like James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Amy Lowell, and T. S. Eliot is dramatically attested to in his voluminous correspondence and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  frequent essays. In a particularly striking parody of Eliot's famous declaration of his loyalties in "For Lancelot Andrews," Lovecraft incorporates the following into a hyperbolic rant on the merits of cheese in one of his letters: "I am a caseist in diet, a cattist in zoölogy, and an Anglo-Cathartic in religion. Shantih! Shantih! Shantih!" (Letter to Frank Belknap Long, October 17, 1930, <span style="font-style:italic;">Selected Letters: 1929-1931</span> Volume 3, eds. August Derleth and Donald Wandrei [Sauk City: Arkham House, 1971], 191). In a 1929 letter, Lovecraft contextualizes his embrace of tradition as a bulwark against modernity in relation to similar gestures by his contemporaries: "I'm not the only one to see a really serious problem ahead for the sensitive aesthete who would keep alive amidst the ruins of the traditional civilisation. In fact, an attitude of alarm, pain, disgust, retreat, and defensive strategy is so general among virtually all modern men of creative interests, that I'm sometimes tempted to keep quiet for fear my personal feeling may be mistaken for affected imitativeness! God, man—look at the list . . . Ralph Adams, Joseph Wood Krutch, James Truslow Adams, John Crowe Ransom, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley . . . Each has a different plan of escape, yet concedes the same thing to be escaped from" (Letter to James Ferdinand Morton, October 30, 1929, <span style="font-style:italic;">Selected Letters</span> Volume 3, 52). Michael Saler reads this shared diagnosis as a sign that Lovecraft shared what he terms "the ironic imagination . . . a form of the modernist 'double consciousness'" ("Modern Enchantments: The Canny Wonders and Uncanny Others of H. P. Lovecraft" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Space Between</span> 2.1 [2006]: 12).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f23" href="#f23-text">23. </a>In the case of Lovecraft this is especially telling; recent reprints featuring introductions by celebrated contemporary writers function similarly to the pulp reprints, except in this case it is frequently the contemporary writer who lends an air of respectability to a chosen ancestor (the Modern Library's "definitive edition" of Lovecraft's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">At the Mountains of Madness</span> with its introduction by China Miéville, a pioneer of "The New Weird" is one case in point).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f58" href="#f58-text">58. </a>Another potential avenue for situating Lovecraft within the context of modernist culture could be opened up by comparing his queasiness when confronted with the idea of occupying the subject position of the other with Wyndham Lewis's criticism that Pound, with his interest in adopting models from the past and from other cultural traditions, was bent on trying to "get into the skin of somebody else" (quoted in Peter Nichols, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernisms: A Literary Guide</span> [London: MacMillan, 1995], 268).</p></div>

	  Eric Hobsbawm once made the startling claim that the most original work of avant-garde art produced in Britain between the wars was Harry Beck’s Tube Map.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In an essay published in the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagined Londons</span>, David L. Pike has examined the basis for this polemical assertion and concluded that “By simplifying the complex network of urban railway lines into a visually pleasing and easily legible map bearing little or no relation to either the experiential or the physical metropolis of London, Beck codified a particularly modernist conception of space.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In Pike’s view, the Tube Map fits into a genealogy of modernist space that originated in the mid-nineteenth century with the blue, red, and yellow lines Baron Haussmann imposed upon a map of Paris. “Such projects undertook, in the physical space of Paris, to control the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> chaotic, ungraspable reality of the modern city through color-coding, straight lines, and diagonal cuts.” (Pike 104–105) Beck’s Map achieved this same goal but in a manner symptomatic of the history of such schemes in London, through its impact upon the representational, rather than physical, space of London. The tangle of sub-surface railways, tube railways, and light railways, built at multiple times and at various levels, had been flattened out and homogenised in a totalising vision of what French sociologist Henri Lefebvre termed <span style="font-style:italic;">abstract space</span>, that is to say, the conception of space as a coherent, homogenous whole, which can consequently be bought and exchanged in the same manner as any other commodity: “Abstract space is a planned and organised space, thought rather than lived, and known conceptually rather than directly experienced.” (Pike, 107) But while modernist space is typically understood to have had no place for the individual, everyday contingency of the city dweller, the Tube Map can be seen to have perpetuated the possibility of individual reverie even as it constrained its limits—and according to Pike it is to this factor that the phenomenal popularity of the Tube Map is to be attributed.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> “While it makes the tube into a closed system, the map also retains the possibility of such an infinite journey through an alternate London space”(Pike, 112). In concluding, Pike speculates that this freedom was facilitated by the primary feature borrowed from its failed predecessors: the bright colours that remain a Victorian trace in Beck’s modernist work of art. Pike continues:

	    Thus, in Pike’s analysis, the Tube Map owes its success to a variation on mainstream modernist practice—the conservation of an oneiric pleasure in an otherwise abstract, rationally organised space. But the Tube Map is, of course, merely one artefact among many to result from the history of modernist innovation in relation to the London Underground, opening up the possibility that the synthesis embodied by Beck’s Map might represent the culmination of a specifically London-based modernist aesthetic. The patronage of postimpressionist artists in the interwar years by the Underground is now common knowledge, having featured in many beautiful, profusely illustrated books published by Capital Transport. Yet there is surprisingly little criticism on the English avant-garde’s intense interaction with the tube-network. Richard Cork provided only a brief overview in an essay on Eduardo Paolozzi’s mosaics at Tottenham Court Road; and, though Michael Saler has produced a remarkable and comprehensive reassessment of the extent of the modernist achievement in England, the focus in his work is very much on the personality of Frank Pick, the executive officer of the Underground and the man behind the company’s innovative design and publicity between the First and Second World Wars. This top-down approach tends to perpetuate the fixed ideas about modernism that Pike has shown to occlude alternative approaches to modern urban space. The specific aesthetic that persuaded artists and architects to channel their energies into the transformation of the London Underground is subsumed into that totalising vision pursued by Frank Pick, who was in any case prepared to take up any product, modernist or not, if it proved to be conducive to the unity of the tube-network. In the following essay, I will establish what the English avant-garde hoped to achieve in participating in the creation of Pick’s Earthly Paradise. I will show that their involvement in this project resulted from a commitment to refashioning the non-places of modernity on a pattern, like that of their continental counterparts, that would impose order on the modern age, but which would preserve that spirit of euphoric reverie that is missing from the schemes of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. In so doing, I reveal common ground for future consideration of the fissiparous modernisms that occupied London at this time, facilitating the ongoing re-appraisal of this collective achievement in relation to the international mainstream centred in Paris.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Mapping the Futurist City</h1>
<p>
	      “I travelled by a tube train yesterday,” enthused F.T. Marinetti in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Evening News</span> in March 1912. “I got what I wanted—not enjoyment, but a totally new idea of motion, of speed.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Since the thought that the Tube might excite such a sensation seems somewhat ridiculous today, these remarks should be put in their historical context. The deep-level tube-railways were for the most part less than six years old in 1912,<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> were excavated not with the tried-and-tested “cut-and-cover” technique, whereby a street was uprooted, the railway put in and covered over and the street replaced (the technique used to build the Paris Metro), but with an innovative mechanical shield that forced the tunnels right through the London clay in a vigorous manner that might have been calculated to please a Futurist. (“I had, of course, travelled by tube [sic] in Paris,” remarked Marinetti, “but it was not the same sensation at all.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>) In 1912, the tube-railway was simply the last word in urban transit. Powered by the largest electricalplant in the world at Lots Road, Marinetti’s tube-car would have rattled and swerved through narrow tunnels far below London: the same ecstatic sensation of power and speed he had taken from automobiles, imparted to the Futurist through a mechanism that constituted an entire urban environment!
	    </p>
<p>
	      In Marinetti’s view these new sensations were a reproof to the artists of England. “Turner once painted an engine, but it was a dead engine, just its outside appearance, not its soul, the soul of power and speed.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> They had failed to capture the spirit of the modern that Marinetti perceived in the tube-railways and in the brilliant-hued motorbuses and in the enormous glaring posters. “London itself is a Futurist City!,”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Marinetti declared, and the Futurist aesthetic was therefore perfectly adaptable to English conditions. Marinetti himself claimed to be preparing a picture that would show what an English Futurism might look like: “I have an idea which may be developed by one of our artists. But I cannot tell you any more about it yet.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> It is entirely possible that this cryptic remark referred to a painting that has since been lost called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> by C.R.W. Nevinson, shown at the London Group exhibition in March 1914. Although no visual record of the work has survived, Richard Cork has observed that contemporary reviews indicate that the piece was a literal fulfilment of Marinetti’s exhortation to the artists of England two years before in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span>. The critic Frank Rutter recalled that the piece was “a circular picture of the interior of a compartment in a ‘Tube’ in which the vibration of seated res and strap-hangers was kaleidoscopically expressed in vivid bright colours.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Westminster Gazette</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> was a “mixture of streaks of light, and fragments of advertisements, and curves, and colour, with lines that suggest straphangers here and there.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> And with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> in mind, P.G. Konody in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Observer</span> declared of C.R.W. Nevinson that
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		He is obsessed with the idea of speed, devotes himself to conveying by pictorial means the sensation of speed in railway trains, and other means of movement by displacing objects, making them penetrate each other, in fact, making several movements simultaneous.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Having garnered more newspaper attention than any other work at the London Group exhibition, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> had established the Tube as a key symbol of that spirit of modernity that the English avant-garde would have to engage with if they were to take up the challenge posed by Marinetti.
	    </p>
<p>
	      But such a straightforward application of Futurist theory to English material was untypical. In fact, the single instance in which the Tube is used as a symbol for a Futurist vision of urban modernity occurs in a story by Russian science-fiction novelist  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Yevgeny Zamyatin, written in 1917, shortly after his sojourn in the UK. In “The Fisher of Men” the Tube is the sweltering belly to an urban-organism brimming over with physical vitality, wherein “the frenzied blood pulsated and sped more frantically along the resounding concrete tubes.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> When London is subjected to aerial bombardment, it is to the white tiled catacombs of the Tube that the city’s inhabitants retreat:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		They clung on to the footboards and then with a roar sped along the tubes, without caring where they were going and got off without caring where they were. They crowded together in the delirious underground world with its concrete sky hanging over them, its confusion of caves, staircases, suns, kiosks, vending machines.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(Zamyatin, 90)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
		The English avant-garde were to take up the challenge of Marinetti very much on their own terms. In fact, Nevinson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> only seems to have received so much press-coverage because it was already considered to be relatively intelligible, compared to the latest work shown at the London Group exhibition by artists such as Wyndham Lewis and David Bomberg, who were moving towards the new aesthetic that was soon to be called Vorticism. Lewis believed that Futurism had its points, but as he explained to the incredulous Marinetti in a water-closet one day: “We’ve had machines here in England for a donkey’s years. They’re no novelty to <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span>.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In Lewis’s view the Futurist’s ecstasy at tube-railways and automobiles could only appear naïve or romantic or even absurd in England, where the impressionism of speed had been memorably expressed some years earlier, in that decidedly un-modernist text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind In The Willows</span> , by Mr. Toad of Toad Hall: “Here to-day—in next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped—always somebody else’s horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O my!”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Marinetti’s rapturous response to the Tube is precisely a case in point. The Italian had perceived merely a new idea of motion and speed. His English counterparts would have been better informed.
	      </p>
<p>
		The creation of the Tube represented a particularly traumatic event in the socioeconomic history of the UK. The earliest tube-railways had been widely considered symptomatic of the threat posed by American innovation and investment to British technological, economic, and political supremacy. The introduction of open-plan American <span style="font-style:italic;">cars</span>, for instance, and a uniform fare, was often seen with horror to impose a foreign vision of social equality upon London.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> And this anxiety on the part of the English toward their new tube-railways had become outright hostility when two American financial tycoons—Charles Tyson Yerkes and J. Pierpont Morgan—began to buy up the rights to construct lines under London, battling it out amongst themselves as each struggled to control the capital’s transport infrastructure. American business methods had provoked outrage at every level of national life, from the pages of the satirical magazine Punch to the floor of the House of Commons. The new idea of motion that Marinetti perceived in the Tube would thus be hard for English writers and artists to embrace without reservation, entangled as it was with the ruthless capitalism that had forced the tunnels through the London clay. In fact, with its enormous glaring posters and tiled stations, built to a formulaic pattern in a prescient attempt at  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> corporate branding, the Tube continued to present Londoners with an overwhelmingly Americanised environment, which anticipated by many years the chief characteristics of those international spaces spawned by Late Capitalism such as motorways, airports, or supermarkets, which Marc Augé has since christened Non-place: a virtual environment that seems to be everywhere and nowhere, entirely cut off from local topography and re-presented to the passenger-consumer through the medium of maps, images, and texts.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
		English artists seem to have held few illusions regarding the political significance of the Tube. In his mural for the Omega Workshop project <span style="font-style:italic;">Scenes of Contemporary London Life</span> (1916–1917), Roger Fry depicted the Underground as the polar opposite of everything that Marinetti had celebrated. The mural shows a weary woman slogging up the steps of a tube-station under the company’s roundel. Excessively large and oppressive, the scarlet circle presses down upon the woman’s hat, the angular border pushing into her face. Far from being caught up in a new idea of speed the woman-passenger is hampered by the bleak confluence of angular planes produced by wall and stair-rail. And on the blocked-up doorway in the room’s wall, Fry painted a railway bookstall, fitted out with newspapers and publicity material (including an advertisement for the Omega Workshop!), reinforcing the corporate connotations carried by the roundel, and reflecting the fact that the Tube is a heavily mediated space produced by a new global brand of consumer-capitalism.
	      </p>
<p>
		If the English avant-garde were to successfully capture the spirit of the modern world they would first have to take into account their own problematic perception of the space picked out by Marinetti as its embodiment. This struggle surfaces in a cluster of Imagist poems published shortly before WWI, reproduced by Andrew Thacker in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Through Modernity</span> . As Thacker notes, Marinetti may have influenced the Imagists, but the latter group never quite eulogised machinery in the manner of the Futurists: “For Imagism transport represented a modern world redolent with anxieties as well as mechanical delights.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> F.S. Flint’s lyric “Tube” was first published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in January 1914, and presents an unspoken address to a second person who examines his or her fellow passengers in vain for a sign, for a light in their eyes. But the passengers are said to sit stolid, lulled by the roar of the train in the tube, content with the electric light, assured, comfortable, warm: “this is the mass, inert; / intent on being the mass, / unalarmed, undisturbed.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The speaker’s despair is momentarily alleviated by the reflection that he and his companion are a “spirit that moves.” The phrase possesses a Futurist flavour, and this suspicion is confirmed by the subsequent lines in which the speaker claims that this spirit of movement is imbued with a transformative potential: “we leaven the mass, / and it changes; / we sweeten the mass, / or the world / would stink in the ether.” The new idea of motion and speed celebrated by the Italian is re-situated in the re of the intellectual—providing him with the means to humanise <span style="font-style:italic;">non-place</span>. The Underground is depicted by Flint as a psychopathological space that might be rendered a habitat through something rather like Marinetti’s urban aestheticism.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Thacker is therefore not entirely correct in saying that “What Imagist poetry celebrated in the machinery of the Underground was not necessarily speed, but rather its ability to stage a poetic encounter which could stress fixity amid the vertiginous bustle of modernity.” (Thacker, 86). On the contrary, Flint’s Tube is rather like Marinetti’s “dead engine”: a technological space that has to be transformed into a <span style="font-style:italic;">metaphor—</span>a vehicle for movement—through the moving spirit of the artist. According to the Imagist Richard Aldington what is new in Flint’s poetry is not the objective so much as the rigour of the form through which the poet seeks to reconcile us to a forced existence in a “gloomy-market-prison-metropolis.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in May 1915, Aldington writes, “The escape is not to be found in chanting of abstract chimneys and racing automobiles, in ecstatic sentimentalizing over super-aeroplanes and turbines, and such-like romantic balderdash.” Instead,
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  there is an escape from artificiality and sentimentality in poetry, and that is by rendering the moods, the emotions, the impressions of a single, sensitized personality confronted by the phenomena of modern life, and by expressing these moods accurately, in concrete, precise, racy language.

		  These faces once again lack the spirit of movement; and this phenomenon is heightened by their juxtaposition with a material environment so dynamic it even serves to lend these apparitions the illusion of vitality.

<p>
		  As well as an Imagist, Aldington was a signatory of the Vorticist Manifesto published in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> in June 1914, and his poem could be interpreted as a polemical illustration of the variation in the Futurist and Vorticist response to the mediated spaces of the modern world. The opposition between the inert passengers content to be carried by the mechanical means of conveyance laid on by their market-prisonmetropolis, and that moving spirit of the artist, which re-fashions modern life in concrete, precise and racy language, is set out in the following passage by Ezra Pound, when he contrasts those who think of man “as the TOY of circumstance, as the plastic substance RECEIVING impressions” with people like himself who “think of him as DIRECTING a certain fluid force against circumstance, as CONCEIVING instead of merely observing and reflecting.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> As Rod Mengham has demonstrated, this is in fact the fundamental difference between Futurism and Vorticism:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    an antithesis that might help to differentiate between two very different artistic enthusiasms for the machine, the one accompanied by a zest for adrenalin, the other by a respect for order; between the Futurist embrace of sheer dynamism and what we might now think of as the kinematic priorities of Vorticism.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
		  Rather than submitting in awe to the new idea of motion and speed embodied by the Tube, the Vorticists followed Flint in situating the moving spirit of the modern world within the artist: “In a Vorticist Universe we don’t get excited at what we have invented,” Wyndham Lewis, ringleader of the Great English Vortex, declared in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span>; “If we did it would look as though it had been a fluke.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Thus, in Lewis’s highly experimental play, “Enemy of the Stars,” the spirit of movement in the Tube is a symbol for the creativity possessed by the Artist. The play is set just south of the Arctic Circle, where the characters Hanp and Arghol live together in a hut at the bottom of a pit. Arghol is the Artist: he has fled from the city to the wilderness, where he dwells in abject poverty, and is beaten regularly by Hanp, who stands for the hateful mass of humanity that both envies and despises the Artist. The Tube is referred to in the Stage Arrangements: “A GUST, SUCH AS IS MET IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE TUBE, MAKES THEIR CLOTHES SHIVER OR FLAP, AND BLARES UP THEIR VOICES.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> In addition to reinforcing the bleakness of the locality, this reference to the unseen forces at work in the Tube evokes Arghol’s “underworld of energy and rebellious muscles” , which ultimately initiates the action of the play. And the Tube was to do so again in Lewis’s work; providing a locus for the violent but potentially redemptive force of the modern artist in a short sketch published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in March 1916 which depicts a young soldier in the Tube:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    This young man was strung to a proud discipline. He was a youthful favourite of Death’s something like a sparring partner. He had the equivalent of chewing-gum, too, in the cynical glitter of his face, and his lazy posing.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Lewis compares the “profound and sinister business” of the soldier to the “functional existence” of the woman, and concludes that our vigorous world would “certainly maul the Constellation of Hercules if that misguided organisation should come in our direction” . Given the polemical stance taken by <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST 2</span> against the German Empire, it seems likely that this militant constellation is a symbol for the Kaiser, and the playful, aggressive, disciplined force of the soldier (problematic in the notorious short-story “Cantleman’s Spring-Mate”) is here a straightforward paradigm for the Vorticist.
		</p>
<p>
		  But the clearest expression of the Vorticist response to the forces at work in the new urban spaces exemplified by the Tube is to be found in Lewis’s short-story collection <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> , in an essay called “The Meaning of the Wild Body.” Seeking to explain his theory of the comic, Lewis remembers how, one day in the Underground, as the train was moving out of the station, “I and those around me saw a fat but active man run along, and deftly project himself between the sliding doors, which he pushed to behind him.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Although there was nothing especially funny about his face or general appearance, “his running, neat, deliberate, but clumsy embarkation, <span style="font-style:italic;">combined with the coolness of his eye</span>, had a ludicrous effect, to which several of us responded.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to Lewis it was <span style="font-style:italic;">the eye</span> that was the key to the absurdity of the effect:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    It seemed to say, as he propelled his sack of potatoes—that is himself—along the platform, and as he successfully landed the sack in the carriage:—‘I’ve not much “power”, I may just manage it:—yes just!’ Then in response to our gazing eyes, ‘Yes, that’s me! That was not so bad, was it? When you run a line of potatoes like ME, you get the knack of them: but they take a bit of moving.’
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    This incident perfectly illustrates Lewis’s view that the root of the comic is to be found in detachment. The new idea of motion that Marinetti experienced in the Tube was less marvellous than the fact that sacks of potatoes like ourselves should move of our own will at all. The Tube can only reinforce our sense of ourselves as fundamentally material objects: and this can result either in the slavish response of Marinetti and Aldington’s passengers, or in the liberating detachment of the fat man who has not made the mistake of identifying “himself with his machine” . The modern urban space of the Underground therefore possessed, in Lewis’s view, potential for profound human comedy: where Aldington’s precise language had tried to neutralise a threat, the polished sides of the Great English Vortex would instead celebrate its comic mastery of the material-world.

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p class="continued">
		  The result was a highly cartographic art:—one has only to flick through the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> to see that this re-ordering of the forces at work in the space of the modern world increasingly came to resemble the two-dimensional format of the map or schematic plan. The process is incomplete in the first issue, where the image that best illustrates this tendency is Lewis’s “Plan of War,” but by July 1915 “The Island of Laputa” and “Atlantic City” by H. Sanders, “Hyde Park” by Frederick Etchells, “Design for ‘Red Duet’” by Lewis, and “Rotterdam” by Edward Wadsworth (that is, every image of a modern landscape featured in the second issue) can be seen to evoke the form of the map or diagram. In this respect, the Vorticist Aesthetic rather recalls the urban redevelopment projects of the modernist mainstream—which, it will be remembered, set out “to control the chaotic, ungraspable reality of the modern city through color-coding, straight lines, and diagonal cuts” (Pike, 104–105). In fact, the momentous introduction of Le Corbusier’s architectural theories to the English-speaking world might have been a consequence of their perceived resemblance to the Vorticist Aesthetic. The English translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Vers Une Architecture</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Urbanisme</span> were both undertaken by the Vorticist Frederick Etchells, who believed that the main thesis of the book translated as <span style="font-style:italic;">The City of To-morrow and Its Planning</span> , “is that such a vast and complicated machine as the modern great city can only be made adequately to function on the basis of a strict order.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Le Corbusier had denied that his theories indulged the mere fancy of some neurotic passion for speed, noting that speed is now a brutal necessity and that western cities must reorganise these mechanical forces on an orderly rational plan, like that for a “City of Three Million Inhabitants”. “This is no dangerous futurism, a sort of literary dynamite flung violently at the spectator,” Le Corbusier explained. “It is a spectacle organized by an Architecture which uses plastic resources for the modulation of forms seen in light” . It must have seemed that Le Corbusier was fulfilling in the field of town-planning what the Vorticists had hoped to achieve in graphic art. Etchells’s eagerness to re-situate Le Corbusier’s thought within the framework of the English discourse of the London Underground is signalled by his curious decision to change the word “metro” to “tube” throughout and to reproduce a full-page sectional image of the rebuilt Piccadilly Circus Tube Station in his introduction, as an illustration of the menace posed by mechanised forces lacking in organisation.
		</p>
<p>
		  But having pointed out this shared emphasis on mapping one should note that the effect the Vorticist hoped to achieve was rather different to that for which Le Corbusier was striving with his “City of Three Million Inhabitants.” For if the Vorticists rejected the Futurism of Marinetti, they were equally unsatisfied with the lifeless formalism of the Cubism that had inspired Le Corbusier: “Picasso’s structures are not ENERGETIC ones, in the sense that they are very static dwelling houses,” wrote Lewis. “They are inappropriate in the construction of a man, where however rigid the form may be, there should be at least the suggestions of life and displacement that you get in a machine.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> As Andrzej Gasiorek observes (in an essay that contrasts Lewis’s views on the role modernist architecture should play in regenerating society with Le Corbusier’s), if Lewis argues in favour of re-ordering and regulating life he also fears that the process of rationalisation may have dystopian consequences, speculating that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> society “might become as mechanical as a tremendous insect world, all our awakened reason entirely disappeared,” and that we might finally be “overpowered by our creation”. <a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> In contrast, as Paul Edwards notes, the typical Vorticist design was not directly transferable to architecture:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    To be true to the two-dimensional multivalency of the pictures, the architecture would need its own form of three-dimensional multivalency, preserving the pictures’ suggestion of multiplying life’s possibilities instead of imposing on the user of the building a univalent experience.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Where the International Style was solemn, uniform, and closed, a Lewisian architecture would have been zestful, pluralistic, and open, “would have as its aim to increase gusto and belief in life, to use our inventions to enjoy all the possibilities of organic life experienced by other species without being reduced to animal or mechanical functionalism” . In calling for the forces that constitute the modern metropolis to be reorganised in line with the brash, colourful, open-ended forms developed by the Vorticists, in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span> , Lewis’s primary objective was to enhance the oneiric urban pleasures celebrated by Marinetti, which would turn out to have no place in the functional International Style.
		</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Sets for a Movie about Babylon</h1>
<p>
		  Lewis believed the Vorticist movement should aim for nothing short of a physical reordering of the visible part of the modern world. He noted in his journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tryo:</span></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    A man might be unacquainted with the very existence of a certain movement in art, and yet his life would be modified directly if the street he walked down took a certain shape, at the dictates of an architect under the spell of that movement, whatever it were.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  He continued, “To take a small example, the posters on the hoardings and in the tubes to-day [1922] would not be quite what they are [ . . . ] if painters and draughtsmen in their studios had not done paintings [ . . . ] of a certain type, during the last ten years”. In Lewis’s opinion this program of renewal would do well to begin with the reinvention of commercial art, particularly the commercial art that appeared in the Tube:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    [ . . . ] if Tube Posters, Magazine Covers, Advertisement and Commercial Art generally, were ABSTRACT, in the sense that our paintings at present are, they would be far less harmful to the EYE, and thence to the minds, of the Public.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast 2</span>, 47)
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Lewis had intuitively understood that our day-to-day experience of modernity is heavily mediated by corporate images and text, and believed that, in imposing their orderly aesthetic upon the medium of the advert, the Vorticists could move very far very quickly toward the production of a space conducive to cultural revolution.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		    His choice of the Tube as a starting point was no coincidence. As shown in the previous section, the London Underground possessed a peculiar symbolic resonance for the Vorticist. Its reordering would constitute a final victory over the vision of the Futurist City in the very space that Marinetti had declared to be a paradigm of the modern world. By the time Lewis published <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span>, the Tube’s status as such in the discourse of the English avant-garde had been confirmed time and time again by those writers who wished to express their own view on the proper relationship that should exist between the space of modernity and the art of the moderns. Perhaps the most notable instance occurs in T.S. Eliot’s famous review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacre du Printemps</span>, published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span> in 1921. Eliot was careful to include the “roar of the underground railway” among the “barbaric cries of modern life” that Igor Stravinsky had related to the rhythm of the steppes and transformed into music. Since this emphasis on “interpenetration and metamorphosis” has been interpreted as an important preliminary to the mythic method of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, it is interesting to note that in praising this reorganisation of modern barbarity into a formally-ordered composition Eliot is echoing a central element in the Vorticist Aesthetic.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    In fact, the symbolic resonance of the Tube for self-consciously modern writers and artists had become such a commonplace that it even became the subject of satire in Aldous Huxley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Crome Yellow</span> . In this novel, the monstrous intellectual Mr. Scogan explains that he prefers the modern style of painting because he likes to see pictures from which nature has been completely banished—exclusively the product of the human mind—and that this is why he always chooses to travels by Tube:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      For, travelling by bus, one can’t avoid seeing, even in London, a few stray works of God— the sky, for example, an occasional tree, the flowers in the window-boxes. But travel by Tube and you see nothing but the works of man—iron riveted into geometrical forms, straight lines of concrete, patterned expanses of tiles. All is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds. All philosophies and all religions—what are they but spiritual Tubes bored through the universe! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is recognizably human, one travels comfortable and secure, contriving to forget that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass of earth, endless and unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus every time

</blockquote>
<p>
			But it must have appeared far from probable in the early twenties that the Vorticists would in fact have the chance to make-over this richly resonant space in line with their aesthetic. Frank Pick, the Publicity Manager for the Underground Group, had certainly achieved something of a reputation for innovative design. Frank Pick had commissioned the radical sans-serif type-face and the roundel for the station-signs (which subsequently became one of the earliest corporate logos) from typographer Edward Johnston. He had ventured into the hitherto disreputable poster-industry, commissioning posters from E. McKnight Kauffer and F. Gregory Brown. But, prior to the inter-war period, Pick’s interest in modern art had hitherto extended no further than the Impressionists. Moreover, the vast bulk of the pictorial material he had commissioned up to this point had been in exactly that tired style of poster-art (by Frank Brangwyn and his ilk)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that Lewis had attacked in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span>: “the sugary couple on the walls of the Tube, that utter their melancholy joke and lure you to the saloons of the Hackney Furnishing Company” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caliph</span>, 132).
		      </p>
<p>
			But, set aside for one moment, the style in which such early posters were produced and one can see much the same preoccupation with movement, modernity and mapping that had so preoccupied the avant-garde. The emphasis upon movement and modernity is particularly evident in two posters by Charles Sharland: <span style="font-style:italic;">Light, Power and Speed</span>  depicts new trains brought into use following the electrification of the system in 1905, while <span style="font-style:italic;">Paddington New Station</span>  presents a sectional image of the first moving-staircase in the UK, introduced at Earl’s Court Station in 1911.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Furthermore, a need, like that of the Vorticists, to refashion the spaces of urban modernity emerges in a series of posters, such as the famous image by John Hassall in which an elderly couple ask their way of a policeman who silently jerks a thumb to a map of the system on the wall of a tube-station.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> As Michael T. Saler shows, Pick believed London was a terrifying sprawl, and sought to promote a public image of the tube-network as an integrated entity, in order to achieve in microcosm that organic unity he had failed to find in urban modernity.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>
			Pick’s objectives thus had much in common with those of the Vorticist Aesthetic. Perhaps Pick realised this when he saw an image by Nevinson, on a poster to advertise an exhibition of war-paintings in the Tube in 1918. In this image Nevinson’s fluid Futurism had hardened into the angular energy that is such a marked characteristic of Vorticist Art. The arresting impact of this poster is reflected in the prominent reference to the artist in Walter Bayes’s painting of exhausted Londoners sheltering from aerial bombardment, in the station at Elephant &amp; Castle, called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Underworld</span> . However this may be, soon after the appearance of this poster Pick began to commission posters from E. McKnight Kauffer that reflected that artist’s intense involvement in the Vorticist Movement.
		      </p>
<p>
			McKnight Kauffer came to England in 1914, and found work with the Underground Group through the commercial-artist John Hassall, producing posters that depict rural landscapes near London in a style that combines elements from Van Gogh, Fauvism, and Art Nouveau. Kauffer’s engagement with the Vorticist Movement first became evident in 1917, following the creation of a striking image called <span style="font-style:italic;">Flight</span> (subsequently converted into the poster that launched the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span> in March 1919). The first version of this image is in the form of a woodcut, a vehicle favoured by several Vorticist artists, such as Edward Wadsworth and David Bomberg, and the final version perfectly exemplifies the incorporation of the Futurist impressionism of speed into a formal geometric pattern that serves to amplify the sensation of movement.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
			In that same spring Kauffer became Secretary to the London Group and produced posters for their exhibitions and for commercial clients that reflected his increasing fascination with Vorticism, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sale at Derry &amp; Toms</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Vigil the Pure Silk</span> for Walkers Brothers, and was instrumental in encouraging Wyndham Lewis to resurrect the English Vortex as X Group in 1920 . According to Mark Haworth-Booth, the X Group exhibition was “the last flourish of Vorticism,” but while the failure of X  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Group certainly marks the end of the Great English Vortex as an organisation, it also heralded the period in which the peculiar aesthetic developed by the Vorticists enjoyed its greatest popularity . In fact, some of the most brilliant, and by far and away the most influential, plastic art in the style came in the years following the fall of X Group, as Pick permitted former Vorticists to realise their ambitions for the reordering of the metropolis in projects commissioned by the Underground Group. Not least among these belated works of art were the striking posters in which Kauffer found an outlet for his interest in the Vorticist Aesthetic. As Lewis later remarked, Kauffer “disappeared as it were belowground, and the tunnels of the ‘Tube’ became thenceforth his subterranean picture galleries” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting,</span> 212).
		      </p>
<p>
			Kauffer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales are best reached Underground</span>  was the first produced for Pick in the Vorticist style, and was described by Roger Fry as a “fascinating silhouette of dark forms to begin with, and out of these forms gradually disengage themselves hints of the flutter of mackintoshes blown by a gusty wind, of the straining forms pushing diagonally across the driving rain.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> According to Fry, this poster marked a move toward abstract form: “the familiar shapes of such a scene are taken as the bricks to build up a most intriguing pattern”.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Kauffer’s Vorticism soon manifested itself again in a series to promote various museums commissioned by the Underground Group between 1922 and 1923. Angular patterns convey the inorganic growth of crystal in the poster for the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Museum of Practical Geology</span>, and recall images produced by Lewis shortly before WWI. And as Haworth-Booth observes, the spectacular stylised flames that evoke the Great Fire of London in the poster <span style="font-style:italic;">London History at the London Museum</span> are almost certainly derived from Edward Wadsworth’s woodcut <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Country, Blast Furnace</span>  (34, 6). But the final poster with the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales are best reached by Underground</span>  is by far the most successful application of the Vorticist Aesthetic to the commercial medium of poster-art.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Inessentials are stripped from bold blocks of colour held in a tense network of forces. Two female shapes barely sheltered by umbrellas swept about like the folds of their coats move between bars of rain that are slanted to strike them, but are sustained by curves of warm brown and red that move the eye on to the entrance of a tube-station. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales,</span> Kauffer perfectly captures the spirit of movement embodied by the metropolis in a brilliant two-dimensional plan thereby enhancing, through the change posters effected in the semiotic space through which the passenger moved, the element of reverie in travelling by Underground.
		      </p>
<p>
			Inevitably these experiments provoked a ferocious backlash from reactionaries. Following the appearance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales</span>, the Advertising Manager at <span style="font-style:italic;">Pear’s</span>, took Kauffer to task in an attack that seems to have extended to the artist’s earlier work.

			The hostility rumbled on throughout Kauffer’s Vorticist Period, culminating in the coinage of the term “McKnightmare” in a trade journal in 1924 . This constant criticism may have provoked Kauffer’s retreat into a tamer style. Though it is impossible to tell whether this retreat took place at Pick’s instigation or on the artist’s own initiative, it is certainly the case that some years were to pass before Kauffer again produced posters in as strident a modernist style as that employed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales</span>.

Kauffer’s Vorticist Period had indeed proven very popular with the “higher thought.” The wry tone in which Evelyn Waugh’s Charles Ryder confesses to hanging Kauffer posters on his college wall in <span style="font-style:italic;">Brideshead Revisited</span> may even suggest that in the early twenties Kauffer possessed something like the highly paradoxical combination of mass-popularity and counter-cultural cool currently enjoyed by the street-artist Banksy.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> And this support may well have encouraged Kauffer to work back toward a modernist style in the posters he produced for the Underground Group from the late twenties—a style more rigorously oriented to the medium than his early efforts, but which retained that peculiar fusion of mapping and movement that characterised the Vorticist Aesthetic.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The most perfect example of this new style is <span style="font-style:italic;">Power—the Nerve Centre of London’s Underground</span> .<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> In this poster, text and image are integrated into a design wherein a rudimentary representation of the power-station that generated electricity for the network is shown superimposed upon what seems a swirling dynamo about the corporate logo, from which lashes out sinuous and sinewy a black and blue-veined fore-arm and fist that strikes a bolt of jagged energy at the word “Underground.”
		      </p>
<p>
			The triumph of the Vorticist Aesthetic in the Tube opened the medium of the poster to other members of the avant-garde in England. Clive Gardiner, C.R.W. Nevinson, Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious, and Edward Wadsworth, and leading res with an international profile, such as Man Ray, Zero (Hans Schleger), and Lazslo Moholy-Nagy, were all commissioned to produce posters for the London Underground.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> And soon other corporations, such as Cunard and Shell-Mex, began to emulate the Underground Group’s success, commissioning innovative poster-art from Kauffer throughout the thirties.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Through Kauffer’s tube-posters Vorticism achieved an immeasurable impact on the field of commercial art, and on the mediated spaces that are such an important component in the non-places of the modern world more generally. Without the example of Kauffer, Beck’s Tube Map, with its bright colours and orderly abstraction, would have been unthinkable, and such schematic maps have, of course, become an integral element what Augé termed the non-place.
		      </p>
<p>
			Kauffer’s success also paved the way for the reordering of the physical space of the metropolis in line with the Vorticist Aesthetic—as Pick sought to apply the modernist principles Kauffer exemplified in poster-art to the architectural composition of the city itself. The most highly publicised instance of this process was the fateful decision to commission sculpture from Jacob Epstein, for the Underground Group’s Headquarters Building at 55 Broadway, in 1928. Epstein had been a leading member of the Vorticist Movement. As Cork has noted, the sculptor had in fact been instrumental in persuading Ezra Pound that a new initiative in modern British art was worth supporting: “So far as I am concerned,” Pound wrote, “Jacob Epstein was the first person who came talking about ‘form, not the <span style="font-style:italic;">form of anything’.</span>”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>
			Epstein’s sculptures for the Underground Group were to achieve an international exposure unlike that previously accorded to any other piece of modernist art produced in the United Kingdom. As Henry Moore later observed, “he took the brickbats, he took the insults, he faced the howls of derision … and as far as sculpture in this century is concerned, he took them first”.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The unveiling of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> on May 24 and <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> on July 1, 1929 provoked a barrage of philistinism and xenophobia that was immediate and ferocious. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>, for instance, described <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> as “a great coarse object in debased Indo-Chinese style, representing a creature half-Buddha, half mummy, bearing on its knees a corpse-like child of enormous proportions,”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> and this report was reprinted in newspapers as far away as Melbourne in Australia and Christchurch in New Zealand. The sculpture <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> was too extreme even for Pick. “I have only seen pictures of it, and in these I must say it looks awful,” Pick confessed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Evening Standard</span>; “But you cannot get the right perspective by taking it by itself. It must be judged in relation to the whole building, and then I think people will not find fault  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		      </p>
<p>
			Epstein’s two monumental sculptures closely echo the stepped form of 55 Broadway. <a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Each group features a seated re whose legs suggest the pillars on either side of the door beneath and the first tier of the building, behind which loom the high-rise blocks set back from the street. The seated re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> is a mother re, remote and sombre, who supports the head of a male re lying in her lap, over whom she passes a huge and powerful hand. The seated re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> is a father re with a flat fierce face that stares implacably out, who shelters—and seems about to raise—a male child, its head improbably but expressively twisted to face the father, its crotch pushing controversially out at the street, as though rising with the father’s massive hands. Contrary to what Holden believed, each sculpture is responsive to the possibilities presented by its environment. <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> is flattened toward the front to take full advantage of the noon sun: the res stand apart from the façade, the effect of their mass amplified by the light, the outline unbroken by shadow. The rounded back serves to emphasise the volume, the latent power of the father re, when the sculpture is viewed from an angle. Combined with the child’s recessive chest, and the forward thrust of the father’s arms, the sculpture seems to have swollen open to the sun, as though the father re’s back were some tremendously thick, stony husk. <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> is also very well suited to its situation: positioned on the north side, banished from sunlight, the sculpture is now stained with streaks of moisture and is tarnished with patches of moss and lichen that lend the piece a fitting atmosphere of human neglect and inhuman vitality. To have “stuck” any group on 55 Broadway that paid no regard to Holden’s design would have produced “a very restless effect,” Epstein explained to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manchester Guardian</span>.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Epstein’s sculptures therefore interpret the purpose of the Headquarters Building for the Underground Group—and what they show are elemental godlike res that rouse and lay to rest. Epstein revealed that he had first considered representing the traffic moving in and out of stations, and his final work clearly conveys the powerful, pervasive, and parental control the Underground Group had assumed in the life of the capital.
		      </p>
<p>
			The sculptures of the Four Winds by Eric Gill, Eric Aumonier and Henry Moore, high above <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> serve to reinforce this message. Facing the four points of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the compass, the res emphasise the totalising cathedral-like element in the Headquarters Quarters Building, which, with its cruciform plan, immediately opposite Westminster Abbey, is at once in continuity and in conflict with that embodiment of English history. Though Holden later claimed that the cruciform plan was purely functional, permitting the pedestrian to cut across the site, the monumentality was surely a factor—as Sir William Holford observed—or why the masonry cladding when he might have chosen to highlight his functional steel-frame with glass curtain-walls?<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> With the Headquarters Building Holden re-enacted the cultural <span style="font-style:italic;">tour-de-force</span> effected by the English Cathedral, but through an architecture of horizontal bands and small vertical setbacks that evoked the Babylonian Ziggurat or the bristling energy of the New York skyline: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span>, for instance, thought 55 Broadway “perhaps the nearest approach to a skyscraper in London.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Similarly, while Holden commissioned avant-garde sculptors who would celebrate the Tube’s modernity, power, and speed, he insisted that Epstein carve directly onto the building after the practice in the Middle Ages. 55 Broadway is thus the culmination of an astonishing, London-based variation on the modernist aesthetic. The cathedral skyscraper embossed with the four winds, with day and night, is expressive of a harmonious totality, of a mastery of time and space, even as it evokes the Futuristic City praised by Marinetti and the atavistic urban fantasy Lewis had sought to capture in his plans for a city that would have looked like “sets for a movie about Babylon.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

			Charles Holden had come as close as conceivably possible to realising Lewis’s call for a transformation of the architectural space of modernity in a style congruent with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the Vorticist Aesthetic. Holden had worked with Epstein when the two collaborated on the building for the British Medical Association: he would therefore have been aware of his colleague’s involvement with the Vorticist Movement, and must have read its pronouncements on the future of architecture with interest. However that may be, it is clear that Holden evolved a singular architectural style that seems rather more closely related to the spirit of Kauffer’s poster-art, for instance, than to the constructions of the Bauhaus. Though his stations on the Morden extension are in the International Style previously little known in England, they possess a historical and topographical resonance absent from the universalist designs of the European mainstream. The folding screens that bear the corporate logo are framed by façades built not in concrete but Portland Stone, a building material with strong historic associations with London. And the station-buildings on the extensions to Cockfosters and Uxbridge follow a similar procedure. These functional box-like structures with their enormous square windows might have been created by Le Corbusier had they not been constructed in the beautiful brick common to southern England. This humane modern architecture is probably inspired by the fusion of German Bauhaus and American Organic Architecture practiced by the Dutch Modernist Willem Dudok; but other elements in these stations remain hard to explain. Holden’s supposedly functional station-architecture is invested with the historically resonant and the futuristically fantastical. Mediaeval stained-glass, wheels with leaf-springs, narrow fin-like towers, a spire like an electrical tesla coil, and the re of an archer like a car’s hood-ornament by Eric Aumonier: Each emphasises the magic of the machine-age metropolis, in a manner that evokes a specifically Vorticist Aesthetic.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

			This fantastical functionalism found full expression in the re-built Piccadilly Circus. Though entirely practical, facilitating passenger-flow by opening out cramped passages into a single circular space, Holden’s subsurface interchange still fires the imagination. The futuristic ambulatory is plated in Travertine marble, the building material synonymous with Rome; over the escalators a map of the world, painted by Stephen Bone, highlighted the territories controlled by the British Empire; and a clock showing the time at various places about the globe was later installed.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> declared that the renovated space had been “utterly transformed by modern architecture and modern art into a scene that would make a perfect setting for the finale, or indeed, the opening chorus of an opera.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> With this triumphant reordering of an architectural space at the heart of the metropolis, in a form that combined functional and fantastical, Holden had, in fact, fulfilled the final objective in the Vorticist Manifesto:

<p>
			By the mid-thirties the English avant-garde had transformed the London Underground into Europe’s pre-eminent modernist space, avoiding the pitfalls that awaited the grand plans of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, at a time when these, for the most part, remained on the drawing-board. The brightly-coloured but rational map, the fanciful but forceful commercial art, the playful but functional architecture: according to any criteria the Vorticist Project in the Tube must be considered a success that put the achievement of the Parisian Purists at that point in time into the shade. According to any criteria, that is, other than that of the movement itself. The Vorticists had really believed that the revolution of material reality would bring about a cultural revolution, transforming the way in which the public perceived and interacted with the modern world. As Lewis himself later acknowledged, in this they had not been correct. “Though one Kauffer does not make an Underground summer, poster art is somewhat more alive than it was, and a few shop-fronts, here and there, give a ‘modern’ flavour,” he remarked, in an influential review of the Vorticist achievement in the UK:

			  the element of utopian reverie that found no place in the International Style, Vorticist art had still lacked sufficient sensual appeal, resulting in interiors “obviously designed for a particularly puritanic athlete of robotic tastes, with an itch for the rigours of the anchorite, and a sentimental passion for metal as opposed to wood.”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> But, as Andrzej Gasiorek has convincingly argued, the real fault is surely that, in spite of its sane and humane aesthetic, Vorticism ultimately shared Le Corbusier’s conception of the modern city as a problem, envisaging “a scenario in which <span style="font-style:italic;">design</span> (order) was pitted against the <span style="font-style:italic;">everyday</span> (formlessness) on which it sought to bestow meaning” (Gasiorek, 143). For all its attention to the contingency of the passenger, the transformation of the London Underground was still a totalising plan imposed on the capital by a central authority— a Design Caliph—which in rationalising only served to reinforce the nascent spaces of consumer-capitalism. Henri Lefebvre’s critique of the International Bauhaus can therefore equally be applied to the Vorticist Movement: “The curious thing is that this ‘programmatic’ stance was looked upon at the time as both rational and revolutionary, although in reality it was tailor-made for the state—whether of the state-capitalist of the state-socialist variety.”<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Lewis later confessed that at the time he wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span> he had not appreciated the extent to which the “hideous foolishness of our buildings, our statues, our interiors” was matched by the “hideous foolishness” of our social and economic life: “nor how impossible it is, until that core of bottomless foolishness is altered for the better, to acquire the kind of gay intellectual shell that I wished” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Rude</span>, 169). In creating a bright, new, and enchanting capital, the Vorticists  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had produced the blueprint for a Babylon that was more <span style="font-style:italic;">functional</span> than if had it been <span style="font-style:italic;">functionalist</span>. They had perpetuated the spaces of the market-prison-metropolis. They had formulated the Art of Being Ruled.

			  This might explain why the English avant-garde persisted in depicting the Tube as a symbol for an as yet unredeemed Modern World. In W.H. Auden’s “Letter to Lord Byron” , it is “The bowler hat who strap-hangs in the Tube / And kicks the tyrant only in his dreams, / Trading on pathos, dreading all extremes.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In Aldous Huxley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Point Counter Point</span> , a naïve young member of the intelligentsia called Walter Bidlake is shown to approve the nationalisation of the mines, but is unable to stomach sitting next to an elderly man who spits on the floor of the Tube and smokes a pipe that stinks: “Walter looked away; he wished that he could personally like the oppressed and personally hate the rich oppressors.”<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> And as Hugh Kenner pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mechanic Muse</span>, it is the Tube that T.S. Eliot turns into a metaphor for descent to the Underworld in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Quartets</span>—drawing upon his own experience travelling from South Kensington to Russell Square every day well into his mid-forties: “To change from the one line to the other he had to ‘descend lower,’ as puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Burnt Norton</span>. One way down was by spiral stairs, on which you turned and turned the narrow gyre in half-darkness.” Or he could take the lift, an abstention from movement, while the world moved, “in appetency on its metalled ways”.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In the Underground, Eliot had found a space of alienation that could provide him an objective correlative for the mystical Way of Negation:

In insisting on the everyday as the site of the unplanned and open-ended creativity of the individual, Lewis had initiated a new phase in the struggle to make a home of the modern world.

<p>
				From the invasion of the station-platforms in the Blitz depicted by Henry Moore and Bill Brandt, to the station-busking celebrated by Eduardo Paolozzi, to the graffiti-art memorialised by novelist John Healy—every subsequent desecration of the ordered space of the network has found champions among writers and artists in the modernist tradition. Even Metroland, an environment formerly reviled by the intelligentsia, has found champions who recognised it, at long last, as a significant triumph of the individual over the non-places of the Modern World. But in the final section of this article I would like to draw attention to a forgotten modernist masterpiece produced in the inter-war period that already seems to exhibit the shift in perspective prescribed by Lewis.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
				Anthony Asquith’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Underground</span>  is an innovative motion-picture that shares the Vorticist preoccupation with the reordering of urban impressions of speed into a rigorously stylised aesthetic. But this little-known piece is also a celebration of cinema’s long love-affair with urban transport.<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> The long opening shot, in which a point of light opens up in the darkness like the iris of a camera to reveal a tube-station rushing to fill the screen, echoes the Lumières short of a train arriving and (swiftly followed by a shot in which elevator-steps slide up over the screen like a film-reel) serves to impress forcibly upon the viewer the intimate bond that exists between the motion picture and the railroad. As Lynne Kirby notes,
			      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
				  As a machine of vision and an instrument for conquering space and time, the train is a mechanical double for the cinema and for the transport of the spectator into fiction, fantasy, and dream. It is a metaphor in the Greek sense of the word: movement, the conveyance of meaning.<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
				Kirby speculates that directors were quick to seize on the train for the “sense in which the railway journey provides a contained space and time, a special ‘nowhere’ outside the sphere of normal rules and codes of conduct” . And this observation seems particularly suggestive given the formative role the Tube has played in the development of the <span style="font-style:italic;">non-lieu</span>. In associating the camera with the train, the elevator with the film-reel, Asquith implied that the modern medium of the motion-picture can best represent and make meaningful a non-place that more traditional art-forms had failed to comprehend. Shots that recall the primitive short-films of sensation and spectacle are incorporated into a piece with the haunting symbolism of Expressionist Cinema. Importing a lighting specialist from Germany, and choosing a lead-actress “with the face of a Modigliani,” Asquith produced what is perhaps the UK’s single important contribution to modernist cinema in the silent period.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>
				But what sets the film apart from other modernist representations of the Underground by English writers and artists in the interwar period is the unprecedented interest evinced in the everyday lives of the people who use the space: “The ‘Underground’ of the Great Metropolis of the British Empire, with its teeming multitudes of ‘all sorts and conditions of men,’ contributes its share of light and shade, romance and tragedy and all those things that go to make up what we call ‘life.’”<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> It is for this reason, the opening title-card explains, that the Underground is the setting for a “story of ordinary work-a-day people”. The sensational shot that opens the movie is thus followed by an intimate sequence set in a packed tube-car that attempts to convey something of the subtle interactions that take place between passengers while they travel to work.
			      </p>
<p>
				There is too little space for a full account of Asquith’s extraordinary motion picture. But the scene in which Bill and Nell fall in love (following the shot of the elevator-steps rising like film-reel) merits special mention: walking in opposite directions, the wrong way up parallel elevators, half-way along the shaft, Bill and Nell appear to be holding back time as they flirt over the barrier as well as gloriously abusing the most functional of spaces in a tube-station. Later, as they stand next to one another apart from the crowd,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> innovative lighting reveals the passion seething beneath their humdrum conversation. The camera pans back to show us what they would like to be doing: when they part, Bill and Nell leave their titanic shadows locked in a fierce kiss.
			      </p>
<p>
				And the finale is also of particular interest. At this crucial moment in the film, Asquith once again chooses to mount the camera on a mechanism for movement (in this instance, a lift), thereby transforming this transport system into a moving picture, an optical instrument for observing the capital that serves to heighten, rather than marginalise, our imaginative and emotional engagement with the space; realising that experience of the city that the Vorticists had sought to capture and refine in their art.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> In this, his first solo project, Asquith had proven that film might easily achieve that end for which more traditional mediums such as painting had struggled so hard: a truly <span style="font-style:italic;">kinematic</span> art.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> An art which pointed a way to move beyond a blueprint for Babylon; the project of making ourselves at home in the modern world.

	There are three mythic towers. The first was the “useless and monstrous” blot on the skyline erected in 1889 not by an architect but by a “builder of machines,” an aesthetic blight so despised by the cultural old guard of France that, to use a notorious example, Guy de Maupassant preferred to dine at its base since that was the one place in Paris where he was assured of not having it in view.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then there is the icon which, when it appears onscreen in Hollywood films to signify Paris, is accompanied by the title, “PARIS,” because it is so hard to believe that this image could really be of <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> Eiffel Tower, the real one in Paris, and not just another simulacrum. Between these—that is, between the novelty and the cliché—is the tower internationally celebrated by avant-garde artists and writers. This tower was regularly identified as a new Tower of Babel,<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> thereby calling to mind all of that myth’s rich and often contradictory implications of unity and diversity, ascension and downfall, and grandeur and folly. Though this association was first prompted by the tower’s terrific and novel height, it proved all the more fitting as the tower came to represent a shared circuit of communication that superceded and transgressed geographic, national, and linguistic boundaries. It served, of course, as a modernist visual icon, the subject of so many and so various visual representations in the early decades of the twentieth century as to defy cataloguing (the paintings of Robert Delaunay, the photographs of László Moholy-Nagy, the collages of Jaroslav Rössler, the posture of dancer Milča  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Mayerová in Viteslav Nezval’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Alphabet</span> [1926], any number of concrete poems, films, plays, and so on). Moreover, it was the inspiration for a European network of towers, including the Petřín tower in Prague  and Tatlin’s proposed <span style="font-style:italic;">Monument to the Third International</span> . Radically innovative conceptualizations of space were nourished by the tower’s scale, the openness of its structure, and the multiplicity of viewpoints provided (both of it and from it). Yet these spatial renegotiations were not solely visual, and it is a different sensory perception of the tower that I would like to consider in focus here.
      </p>
<p>
	Gustave Eiffel’s denigrators were quite right: he <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> a builder of machines, and it was precisely this “new architectural order,” as Fernand Léger recognized it in a 1924 manifesto, “the architecture of the mechanical,” that fascinated poets ready for formal and sensory experimentation.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> The tower was as much a new kind of machine as it was new architecture. In a 1932 radio broadcast on the collapse of a bridge in Scotland, Walter Benjamin draws upon notes that we find in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Passagenwerk</span> to praise iron construction, and specifically the Eiffel Tower.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> His source in both instances is Alfred Gotthold Meyer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Eisenbauten: Ihre Geschichte und Ästhetik</span> , and the passage he fondly repeats describes the construction site where “the sound of chisels” cannot be heard; rather, “thought reigns over muscle power, which it transmits via cranes and secure scaffolding.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> More than to the novelty of this new construction material, Benjamin was drawn to what struck him as a new <span style="font-style:italic;">method</span> of construction and, by implication, a significant new function to its result. Essential is the verb “transmits”: the Eiffel Tower is not just a transmitter but itself a transmission. Indeed, the emphasized reign of thought suggests a psychic transmission, and the effect of the tower in this context becomes suggestive of the “auratic perception” that Benjamin pursued and which is perhaps too much, too exclusively associated with sight.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
	French salutes to the tower by Guillaume Apollinaire and Blaise Cendrars are well known to students of modernism,<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> though their far-flung dissemination represents a history still in the making, and it is easily forgotten that neither Apollinaire nor Cendrars was in fact a native son of France. This commonality is of interest precisely because the tower’s call extended beyond the borders of France: it could be “heard” rather than “seen” in such diverse places as Moscow, Madrid, New York, and Prague, and, what’s more, the call could be answered, from city to city. Within a decade of its construction (though experimentation had begun even before it was completed), the tower became a transmitter for <span style="font-style:italic;">télégraphie sans fil</span>, iconically abbreviated “TSF,” a phenomenon repeatedly celebrated (often in direct connection with the tower) in various languages in Futurist poetry, but also in the poetry of Ultraismo, Orphism, Paroxysme, Surrealism, Poetism, Zenitism, and of course Simultanéisme. For example, Nicolas Beauduin’s “paroxyst” book, <span style="font-style:italic;">L’Homme Cosmogonique</span> , a book wrongfully neglected by much of modernist scholarship, hails “la gloire de Paris moderne” as the city’s vibrations are felt by the human body. Beauduin excitedly calls the tower a “living machine”:

	Beauduin’s rapturous, frenzied invocations of age of “the electric cities”  are illustrative of how, in so much poetry, the subjectivity of the speaker often merges with that attributed to the city, the tower, the machine. This powerful self-identification is perhaps most concisely declared by the German Expressionist poet Alfred Richard Meyer, as overcome by Paris as he was by Apollinaire’s “Zone”: “Ich glühe tief und weiß: / Ich bin der Eiffelturm!” (“I burn deeply and know: / I am the Eiffel Tower”).<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> As further examples to be discussed below attest, this recurrent phenomenon might even be seen as a poetic analogue to the Jerusalem syndrome: whereas afflicted visitors to Jerusalem, even those with no previous religious convictions, become psychotically convinced of new and fantastic ones, poets come to early twentieth-century Paris become overwhelmed, galvanized by a newfound unity with the tower.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>
	TSF ought not to be equated with “radio” as we experience what is today a commonplace medium, often relegated to meaningless background. Its arrival was a disorienting event. Cendrars’s reference to “Les arcencielesques dissonances de la Tour dans sa télégraphie sans fil” (“The Tower’s rainbowesque dissonances in its wireless radio”) in a poem titled “Crépitements” (“Cracklings,” 1916)<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> is a somewhat ironic comparison of the distorted and broken messages of the new TSF with the divinely simple and clear covenant signified by the rainbow (Genesis 9:13–16). Not to be misinterpreted as an earnest elegy for religious certitude or meaningful communication, the poem itself is a faulty message, a sign of the times: “j’envoie ce poème dépouillé à mon ami R . . .” (the phrase “poème dépouillé” can be interpreted in various ways: the stripped poem, the skinned poem, perhaps by implication the barely transmitted poem). Just as the fragmentation of so much of modernist poetry can be likened to the break-up of a radio signal, it is interesting to consider whether the “blank space” of the carefully laid-out poetry of this period ought to be read—and even perhaps voiced or sounded—as radio interference, the various forms and sizes of typography as variations in frequency and volume. (Unfortunately, these very qualities are muted or lost in their reproductions in this forum and the poems’ effects thus diminished, a point worth remembering.) The reorganization of the space of the visual page coincided with the recalibration of sonic space.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	“TSF” did not originally designate a commercial or public enterprise; nor was it suggestive of a human voice until after 1906. It was not until 1921 that the first public radio broadcast came from the Eiffel Tower, and thus the first popular enthusiasm for it was by turns scientific and mythological, and a new, spontaneous, and transnational genre can be evinced by reading poetry published in avant-garde and experimental literary journals in this period: the wireless poem. Like contemporaneous urban odes to electricity, jazz clubs, music halls, subway systems, skyscrapers, and other excitements, the wireless poem effectively serves as historical documentation of this period of international and cosmopolitan urbanization. To observe hyperbole within these poems, even as a primary characteristic, is only to begin to acknowledge the extent of the excitement felt by those who contemplated radio towers such as the Eiffel and understood them to be capable, as Julian Przyboś put it, of “liberat[ing] thought from matter” (“Na wieżach radia z materii myśl wyzwoli”).<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In 1903, the tower had regular communication with city military posts; in 1905 its range was national; by 1908 it reached across the Atlantic.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The tower was most literally “avant-garde” in that it was a military instrument, intercepting enemy messages (such as, most famously, the one that revealed Mata Hari as a German spy in 1917). Its military role was not confined to radio—consider the fantastic-sounding report of how parrots were kept in the tower during the war to listen for enemy aircraft and presumably mimic the dire sound of their approach<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a>—but the essential point here is that its capacity to <span style="font-style:italic;">hear</span> as well as be heard underwrites those many poetic suggestions of the tower as not merely animate but conscious, and capable of conversation.
      </p>
<p>
	In a 1923 poem, Vladimir Mayakovsky has “a little chat with the Eiffel Tower,” in which he whispers “buzzzzz / in her / radio-ear” and tries to woo her to Moscow:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	I’ve agitated all things made and built.

<p class="continued">
	He concludes with a vision of the tower broadcasting radio waves from her brow into the Russian stars, and the promise to get her a visa if she agrees to come with him. It is interesting to note that Mayakovsky converses with the tower in a more respectful  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> fashion than he does with the sun, though being Mayakovsky, he is conspicuously in- formal with both manifestations of something akin to the divine.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> For him, the tower is not at all synonymous with Paris, a place of “dandies and dudes” and “yap-yawning boulevards.” This in itself is important, for although the gendering of the tower in this way is rather conventional—an extension of the same feminization of France, its capital, and Liberty—the proposed separation of the tower from the city and nation which it is commonly thought to represent, made to seem so easy and so right by the seductive Mayakovsky, is as radical a conception as to imagine Hugo Chávez inviting the Statue of Liberty to elope with him to Caracas. For Mayakovsky, as for so many other non-French poets in conversation with the tower (such as his countryman, Alexei Kruchenykh, who had four years earlier written of “blissing off into infashomnia / —YANK!— / like the Eiffel Tower on a string!”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>), the radiant and radiating tower as “model genius of machines” is the exclusive property of no one individual, nation, or culture.
      </p>
<p>
	The tower’s answer is not included in Mayakovsky’s poem, and while judging from its current address, the answer is obvious, it is well worthwhile considering what the voice of the tower sounded like. Morse code might have seemed an erratic sort of disembodied pulse, but the tower’s standardizing (Greenwich) time signal (in use by 1911) to coordinate shipping routes was steady and authoritative. Weather reports, too, were transmitted in Morse code. By 1914, amateur electricians were sharing tips as to how easy it was to tune in:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  An open umbrella makes a good enough antenna when within 30 miles of Paris, and all that is done is to connect one of the metal clips through a flexible cord to the umbrella and connect the second clip to the ground. With a larger metal object, such as a bicycle or automobile, the signals can be heard as far as 120 miles from the Eiffel Tower, so that the tourist can stop anywhere out on the road in order to ascertain the exact time and set his watch. Other metal objects, such as a stove, wire fence or grating, bedstead and the like can be used, and for long distances, such as 300 miles, a good plan is to use a telephone circuit as an antenna, by connecting on to any existing telephone apparatus.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The use of such objects as umbrellas and bicycles as radio receivers may prompt us to reconsider their origins and value as favourite totems of Surrealism. Moreover, the ready and regular availability of the time signal offers insight into both the repeated asking after and stating of the precise time in so much of modernist Parisian poetry. Yvan Goll’s “Paris Brûle” , for example, bristles with news items ranging from the momentous to the absurdly trivial (a railroad workers’ strike, a new rise in the price of sugar, heated announcements from horse races and boxing matches, the death of a seal in Greenland) and ends with the question: “Quelle heure est-il?” (“What time is it?”).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	More and more data came from the tower in the years following the war. Its first news broadcast was heard in 1922, the year that Polish poet Bruno Jasieński wrote that “The city hears it all,” and listed an array of far-flung, disparate news items from California, the Himalayas, and Timbuktu, only to declare:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

<p>
	Unless, that is, poets become themselves receivers, careful listeners, avant-garde interceptors who want their news—the news that will stay news, to borrow Ezra Pound’s germane and readily recycled phrase<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>—firsthand. Poets are effectively superfluous if they reject the opportunity to commune with the international network, the “true gigantic poetry” that affords a modern rhythm to anyone with ears to hear—superfluous if, in short, they remain out of the loop. Jasieński had already exhorted artists to “take to the streets!” and embraced new technology as not just the medium for mass art, but as that art itself: “the telegraphic apparatus of Morse is a 1000 times greater masterpiece than Byron’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Don Juan</span>.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In contrast to Mayakovsky, poets such as the Chilean Vicente Huidobro and the Czech Jaroslav Seifert listen <span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> and are seduced <span style="font-style:italic;">by</span> the Eiffel Tower, which has drawn them to Paris (and more specifically, the Paris of Apollinaire). Huidobro’s “Tour Eiffel”  is most often cited for its opening image: “Tour Eiffel / Guitare du ciel” (“Eiffel Tower / The sky’s guitar”). Yet this is more than an image—it is a metaphor that acknowledges the tower’s multisensory effects. On the one hand, the tower is absorbent, an enchanting summons, a centripetal force (“La télégraphie sans fil / Attire les mots / Comme un rosier les abeilles” [“Wireless telegraphy / attracts the words / as a rosebush attracts bees”]); but it is (to use the word Delaunay and Apollinaire favoured) simultaneously projective, enunciating, centrifugal; the guitar and the bugle from which its music emanates (and as Huidobro asks, “Qui n’a pas entendu cette chanson?” [“Who has not heard that song?”]). A buzzing “ruche de mots” (“a hive of words”), a song-filled “volière du monde” (“aviary of the world”) is how Huidibro characterizes the tower, and he is enthralled by the sound. “Pour monter à la Tour Eiffel,” Huidobro writes,

      Here three definitions of “scale” are playfully conflated (the height of the tower, the act of ascension, and the musical scale) and the act of “mounting” the Tower can be interpreted in a number of ways. The “hive of words” is a symphonic variation on the overpowering dynamo that Henry Adams observed “scarcely humming an audible warning to stand a hair’s-breadth further for respect of power.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The conception of an urban “hive” was not in itself new: Balzac’s Rastignac had gazed upon “cette ruche bourdonnant . . . et dit ces mots grandioses: ‘A nous deux maintenant!’” (“that humming hive . . . and spoke these grandiloquent words: ‘It’s between you and me now!’”).<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> It is not unlikely that Huidobro was directly answering Balzac and the tradition of French literature that Balzac embodies, taking up the challenge to take Paris by storm. Gabriel Insausti has aptly observed that the linguistic manner of “Tour Eiffel” is that of “international diplomacy,” and Huidobro’s decision to write it in French stamps it as “his letter of introduction, his most definitive credential in the eyes of the writers and artists whose recognition he sought.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> That is, in communing with the tower, Huidobro sought the international community of poets of and to which it sang.
    </p>
<p>
      This same broadcast promise of community was sought by Jaroslav Seifert, who in a 1925 poem mourning Apollinaire (whose work Seifert translated), answers and elaborates upon the master’s image of the tower as “Shepherd”:

      As Martha Kuhlman has noted in a recent essay, Seifert’s visit to Paris precisely “parallels Apollinaire’s visit to Prague” and his impression of what Czechs referred to as the “Eiffelka” is filtered through Apollonaire. Kuhlman puts this in visual terms, suggesting  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that “Seifert sees the sights of Paris . . . through the enchanted lens of Apollinaire’s life and poetry,”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> but in the short passage I have just quoted, the emphasis is on hearing (“hark”), so it seems at least as fair to say that Seifert tuned into the Apollinairian frequency as it was transmitted by the tower. Seifert’s characterization of the tower as a “harp” and its conflation with the wind correspond exactly with Huidobro’s “guitar” and “electric wind.” Yvan Goll likewise pairs musical instrument and wind:

      However fanciful it might seem, the sobriquet “magicien” was apt: Gustave Eiffel can be seen as a bold composite of architect, prolific author, impresario, and scientist. His tower was employed for research into wind and air resistance as early as 1903, and at the foot of the tower an aerodynamics laboratory, the first in France, was installed in 1909.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> He even oversaw experiments “to determine the effects of altitude on the human organism,” which “concluded that ascending the tower was excellent therapy for anemia and dyspepsia.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> The ardour, the energetic “high” embodied by the poems of Goll, Huidobro, and others is in a sense reflective of the transformative effects felt by those who ascend and commune with the tower.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The pomp and exhilaration of the poems gathered here for comparison are ably encompassed in Goll’s phrase “acoustique interplanétaire.” These poems are emphatically utterances, projections, soundings-out as much as soundings-off. Yet they also suggest fantastic methods of transport. When Mayakovsky promises to procure the tower a visa, one suspects that the poem is itself being offered as a passport, or at least a ticket to ride. Huidoboro’s poem is a “letter of introduction,” Cendrars’s is an “envoy” or message dispatched, Seifert’s invokes a sailing voyage. To hear and to broadcast is to be part of a voyage. The Spanish Dadaist Guillermo de Torre, too, acutely felt what  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> he called the “<small class="caps">irradiación de los instintos viajeros</small>” (“<small class="caps">irradiation of the traveling instincts</small>”) and mapped out the radiant stations:

		  Transnational currents of information and travel are by this point a given, a prompt to higher ambitions. Like Mayakovsky and Goll, de Torre seeks to project his voice not only across earthly borders but into the stars. The Tower had pointed them in that direction.

		  Douglas Kahn offers a valuable framework for the consideration of transmission as an experience. Transmission, according to Kahn,
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    implied a proliferation and differentiation of objects and situated them in a totalizing notion of space. This particular characteristic can be explained by distinctions between phonography and wireless/radio. Phonography established the objecthood of sound and the ability to replicate a myriad of objects, but it did not strongly imply sounds from a distance. Wirelessness immediately meant great distances . . . Yet, this newfound and newly populated space was not acoustic; the distance between replicated objects was a vacuum that collapsed space to an ideal of instantaneous transmission and reception, a communication without mediation. . . . This structure was anthropomorphized in several accounts of radio and transmission in general to ideas of unmediated communication, thought transference, and signal as corporeal sensation.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  “Communication without mediation” is a concise summary of modernism’s ambitious dream, and ideas of poetry as itself a direct sensation are the very ideals of the avantgarde. These are “words in freedom,” indeed: for the poets I have been discussing, the bliss of communing with the tower surpasses any hitherto highly limited forms of communication.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		  John J. White, a critic who has given much attention to “the telegraphic idiom,” has noted that the “prominent role played . . . by the Eiffel Tower [in Goll’s “Paris brennt”] bridges the gaps between the notions of political revolution, the wireless imagination and unfettered fantasy.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Certainly this claim can be extended to all of the poems noted in this essay, but the phrase “unfettered fantasy” may constitute a refusal to examine the furthest, most ardent and extreme hopes invested in this merging of revolution and imagination. The prospects of transmission—reiterating Kahn: the collapse of space, unmediated communication, the transference of thought and sensation—signify more to the avant-garde than an “idiom” or matter of style. Rather than see form as divisible from poetics, the “telegraphic” qualities and style of the poems of Goll, Cendrars, Jasieński, Beauduin, and others ought to be acknowledged as effects or even symptoms of the “fantasy,” or fantastic-seeming aspirations.
		</p>
<p>
		  After all, the historical context of the observer dictates what constitutes the “fantastic,” not to mention “unfettered.” Barthes, who understood this principle even as (and perhaps to some extent <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span>) he collected the tower as one of his bourgeois mythologies, offers his strongest praise when he suggests it “achieves a kind of zero degree of the monument.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> While Barthes probably means that <span style="font-style:italic;">visually</span> the tower is both there and not there, his invocation of the “zero degree” can be taken as an invitation to consider how the tower functions as a creative force, rather like the “dead” author, and as the embodiment of an aspiration, like the “degree zero” which writing may attain, from Barthes’s well-known meditations on these subjects. The poet who declares “I am the Eiffel Tower” simultaneously declares himself a monument of international stature and effaces his own individual identity;<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> just as, in Barthes’s formulation, the writer dissolves at the instant of writing, these wireless poets seek to transcend the confines of national, linguistic, and even, in a sense, corporeal identity and isolation.
		</p>
<p>
		  De Maupassant may have retreated from the sight of the tower, but it remained above him, listening and singing, and it might be argued that a significant difference between France’s cultural “old guard” and the international avant-garde was that the former could not or would not perceive the tower other than visually, could not or would not hear its song. It is precisely the communicative powers credited to (or discovered in) the tower that explain why “poets were tardy in discovering the Eiffel Tower compared to painters, who immediately saw its visual potency.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> There is more to the experience of the tower than seeing it, just as there is more to the experience of poetry than its appearance in print and more to the avant-garde than iconography and image.
		</p>
<p>
		  If we concede the force of Marx’s observation that “what separates the worst of architects from the best of bees is that the architect erects a structure in the imagination before making it real upon the ground,”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> we can see how this “hive of words” signified an avant-garde breakthrough, for this structure stood so tall both on the ground and in the international—truly transnational—imagination.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		    Likewise, it might be said that avant-garde studies remains by and large preoccupied with the visual. A subtext rather than the specific thesis of this essay, this suggestion challenges readers of avant-garde poetry (excluding the obvious case of Zaum and sound poetry) to think about with what other senses we experience these poems. When a much shorter version of this essay was presented at a conference, Charles Altieri asked about the significance of form, and my answer was and remains: <span style="font-style:italic;">experience is form</span>. This statement holds not just for the reception but also the production of poetry, and a poetics of transmission requires us to study the means of transmission, the transmitter—in this case, the tower.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Modernism and Memory Crisis</h1>
<p>
	Speaking at a conference in Rome in 1961, the Syrian modernist poet Adonis launched a famous and famously intemperate attack on traditionalism in Arabic poetry and poetry criticism. His talk, entitled “al-Shi‘r al-‘arabī wa mushkilat al-tajdīd” [Arabic Poetry and the Problem of Renewal], began by reviewing the classical tradition of literary criticism. Critics of the ‘Abbasid era (c.750–1250), Adonis argued, had only ever sought to inhibit poetic creativity, setting themselves up as guardians of tradition and obstacles to renewal: “The critics defended inherited values [<span style="font-style:italic;">qiyam mawrūtha</span>] and clung to the ancient, exalting it because it was ancient, even when it was ridiculous.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Adonis went on to assert that the traditionalism espoused by these critics had not diminished with the passage of centuries, but rather had become stronger: “The understanding of poetry that dominated our past with all the force of tradition [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-taqlīd</span>] continues into our present with the same force. Indeed, it has grown in acuteness and complexity.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> For modern poets to free themselves from this powerful and creeping sclerosis, they would have to undertake radical measures. It was in this spirit that Adonis announced a “revolt against the traditionalist mentality.”
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Renewal cannot be accomplished by reverting to tradition or by adapting to its poetic conventions, for such a reversion would mean a separation from the present, a shackling of sensibility, a betrayal of reality.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Poetry, he declared at the end of his talk, reaching for the rhetorical heights, was “an act of salvation and liberation” [<span style="font-style:italic;">khalāṣ wa taḥarrur</span>].<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Stephen Spender, one of the respondents to Adonis’s paper, must have heard echoes of his youth in all this (translated echoes, so to speak). But he wondered if Adonis hadn’t overstated the case. T. S. Eliot, Spender reminded the audience, had been both a modernist and a traditionalist. Perhaps the Syrian poet, with all his talk of “revolt,” had been reading too much Rimbaud? Spender ended his brief remarks—according to the Arabic transcription, which is the only one that survives—by reproaching Adonis for his “complete disregard of the ancient heritage [<span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>] of Arabic poetry,” and calling his paper “extremist in its demolition of poetic traditions [<span style="font-style:italic;">mutaṭarrifa fī taḥṭīm al-taqālīd al-shi‘rīya</span>].”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The exchange between Adonis and Spender evokes several of modernism’s familiar and apparently insoluble contradictions: heritage versus modernity, rupture versus continuity, the revolutionary <span style="font-style:italic;">Jetzseit</span> versus the long <span style="font-style:italic;">durée</span> of tradition. While Adonis argues that a reversion to the classical heritage would entail “a separation from the present,” Spender counters that a dismissal of this heritage leads to a separation from one’s own cultural past. Backwardness or inauthenticity, here are the two equally intolerable options that confront so many modernisms of underdevelopment, which experience these contradictions with especial sharpness.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is perhaps because their choice is an impossible one—a choice between two kinds of alienation, we might say—that these modernisms so often employ a rhetoric of crisis, a mode of self-articulation that is frequently extravagant and even melodramatic.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is this excessiveness or “extremism” that Spender objects to explicitly. But while Spender accuses Adonis of chasing after the new and foreign at the expense of the inherited past, other readers have accused him of doing precisely the opposite, claiming that his version of modernism is only a kind of covert pastism, a classicizing movement that calls itself revolutionary. So the Moroccan critic, Abdullah Laroui, in his seminal essay, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis of the Arab Intellectual</span> , lumps Arab modernists together with their European confreres—he mentions Eliot, Pound, and St. John Perse—“all of whom are exponents of tradition and order, and who take as models and foundations of the ‘poetic’ the attitudes and works of the classicizing periods.” Laroui argues that the modernity of these poets merely “consists in their recombining of transmitted culture according to a conscious and unvarying code (poetic technique).” “Now,” he asks rhetorically, “have all the ‘modernists’ of Arab poetry, from Abū Nuwās to Adonis, done differently?”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
	I will argue that Arabic poetic modernism offers neither a flight from the past, nor a flight into the past; neither a mimicry of Western models, nor a mimicry of classical techniques. Rather, what Arabic modernism offers is a series of imaginary, or formal solutions to the crisis of modernity. The form I will look at closely here is the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>, and more specifically Adonis’s monumental <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān al-shi‘r al-‘arabī</span> [Anthology of Arabic Poetry], a three volume work published in Beirut between 1964–1968.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> By calling this work a “formal” solution to the crisis of modernity, I do not mean that it was merely formal (nor that the solution it proposed was finally effective). I am not opposing form to history. On the contrary, I want to show that Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is a complex, situated  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> response to a historical crisis whose contradictions are crystallized in the work’s various levels of argument and allegory. It is because the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> recognizes and articulates these contradictions so masterfully that it is able to hold out the imaginary, or ideological satisfactions of their resolution. Confronted by a memory crisis in the present, I argue that Adonis’s anthology offers the elegiac pleasures of the poetic, now constructed as an autonomous institution. The interlocking parts of this project—narrative, ideological and editorial—combine to a make the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> a remarkably integrated form of Arabic modernism, an artifact that illuminates its surrounding historical strata.
      </p>
<p>
	Each volume of Adonis’s anthology is provided with a lengthy narrative introduction. Let me begin my reading with a citation from the opening section of the first volume, which attempts to conceptualize the entire project as well as to specify its historical motives:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  This poetic museum [<span style="font-style:italic;">hadhā al-matḥaf al-shi‘rī</span>] aids in the reconsideration of poetry as the original creative force in Arab life. For poetry’s role in the present has begun to recede from the level of its authentic mission [<span style="font-style:italic;">risālati-hi al-aṣlīya</span>] in the life of Arabs. This phenomenon is a crisis [<span style="font-style:italic;">azma</span>]. We must to recognize it. Whether the causes of this crisis are political or religious, or traceable to the nature of our historical stage, none of this allows us to turn our attention or studies away from it.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The crisis named here is a crisis of cultural transmission, or translation. It involves the difficulty, perhaps the impossibility, of handing down a certain heritage [<span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>] or mission [<span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span>: message, epistle] from generation to generation. Later on in his introduction, Adonis laments the fact that “the rising generations” are no longer interested in Arabic poetry “because the mentalities and methods that transmitted it [<span style="font-style:italic;">naqalat-hu</span>: translated it] to them could not see in poetry farther than the syntax, meter, and topoi that were mutually agreed upon, and the norms that had been generally sanctioned.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The crisis would thus seem to spring, at least in part, from a fatal institutionalization of tradition, a scholastic rigidity in the understanding of its conventions. What had once been an authentic part of Arab life, entrusted with a mission—“<span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span>” is a word with inescapably religious overtones, suggesting a rivalry between poet and prophet (<span style="font-style:italic;">rasūl</span>)—has now degenerated into a series of codified gestures. Poetry has become a schoolboy’s exercise.
      </p>
<p>
	But the problem of institutionalization is rather different from the one Adonis began with, which was a crisis of cultural transmission. Indeed, the institutionalization of poetry would seem to be less a corollary of this crisis than a possible solution, since the survival of poetry appears guaranteed rather than threatened by its inclusion in a curriculum. The subtleties of Adonis’s argument come into focus around the re of the “museum” [<span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span>], a word he uses more than once as a metaphor for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> itself. It is an odd re to have chosen. For it seems, at first blush, to emphasize the values of conservation and preservation over those echt modernist slogans of revolution and innovation. It identifies modernism with an oddly antiquarian practice: the cataloguing of the potsherds of culture and then their arrangement for display (but already we see how apt the metaphor is for describing the work of an anthologist). If  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the crisis confronting poetry is that its <span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span> in Arab life has begun to recede, then it is not easy to see how placing poetry in a museum counts as a solution, since a museum is precisely where we put the art of the past to rest. As Adorno has noted, “Museums are like the family sepulchers of works of art. They testify to the neutralization of culture.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The museum as sepulcher, or mausoleum, is an unlikely site for the transmission of poetry’s mission. But Adonis clearly has a different ideal of the museum in mind, perhaps something more like what Zukofsky, describing Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, termed “a living museum of facts.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This museum would be an institution that does not testify to the neutralization of culture so much as its activation, renewal, or indeed resurrection.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As Adonis writes in the next paragraph, now in an overtly Neitzschean idiom: “This heritage museum [<span style="font-style:italic;">hadhā al-matḥaf al-turāthī</span>] strengthens our faith, we who believe in the necessity of transformation and the generation of new values, against those who cling to the culture [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ladhīna yatamassakūna bi-l-turāth</span>] literally, repeatedly and coercively.” The establishment of a heritage museum, in other words, is not an act of “clinging to heritage,”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> but rather an attempt to set the heritage free from itself.
      </p>
<p>
	Before attempting to analyze the several elements of Adonis’s argument, it will be useful to zoom out and away from his essay in order to provide a wider, indeed international context for its polemic and formal strategies. This means shifting our attention away from the vehicle of Adonis’s metaphor (<span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span>) to its tenor (<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>), which I have provisionally translated as “anthology.” In the first two sections of this essay, I will argue that the project of anthologization is central to the practice of Arabic modernism as a late and underdeveloped modernism. I attempt to show how the construction of a <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> was critical to its historiographical ambitions as well as its ideological program of aesthetic autonomy. I begin by noting that the anthology has been mostly overlooked by students of modernism, who typically concentrate on its more clamorous cousin, the manifesto. My goal is not to minimize the importance of that form, which has been crucial to so many modernist and avant-gardist projects in their efforts dramatize a break with the art of the past. Rather, I try to show how the anthology has performed a complementary, melancholic function, which is the rewriting or “re-citation” of literary history in the form of an archive (another possible translation of “<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>”).
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> vs. <span style="font-style:italic;">Bayān</span>: Anthology as Re-Writing</h1>
<p>
	Scholars of modernism have mostly ignored the anthology, focusing their attention instead on the more attention-grabbing genre of the manifesto.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> It is an understandable bias. The manifesto’s importance is attested to in the long history of modernist and avant-gardist texts, from Marinetti to the Situationists, passing by way of Pound, Lewis, and Breton. Martin Puchner, in his recent, erudite study of this history, argues that the manifesto is uniquely suited to negotiate “the specific temporality of modernity, a temporality of breaks and new beginnings that nevertheless continue to be confronted with a past that can never be abandoned for good.” This temporality, Puchner claims, “appears nowhere as succinctly and strikingly as in the genre of the manifesto.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> A similar prejudice in favor of the manifesto is observable among critics of Arabic modernism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as well, who have also theorized the <span style="font-style:italic;">bayān</span> (manifesto) as being particularly well equipped to navigate the crises of the present. So the Tunisian critic Muḥammad Luṭfī al-Yūsufī, in his introduction to the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Bayānāt</span> [Manifestos], gives a characteristically heroic description of the genre: “The manifesto is a moment of danger [<span style="font-style:italic;">laḥẓa khaṭira</span>] that puts us in the presence of a form of writing [<span style="font-style:italic;">namṭ al-kitāba</span>] beginning to be formed, a genre that storms over all boundaries” (al-Yūsufī is specifically concerned with the boundary between narrative and poetry).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Typical here is the attribution of performative urgency. The manifesto does not merely respond to “a moment of danger,” but is itself such a moment. It is a genre of writing that promises to violently reshuffle all accepted literary categories and temporalities.
      </p>
<p>
	The corpus of modernist anthologies is, however, at least as extensive as that of the manifesto and in fact both stem from the same author. Filippo Marinetti published the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">I poeti futuristi</span> in 1912, three years after his better known <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifesto</span>. The anthology is reported to have sold 35,000 copies in Italy and included, opposite its cover page, Marinetti’s “Direzione del Movimento Futurista,” an institutional flow chart that included directorates for “Poesia,” “Pittura,” and “Musica.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Anglo-American modernists were aware of Marinetti’s collection and the genre’s popularity during what Chris Baldick has termed “the great age of anthologies” is due in part to this inaugural effort.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The anthologies edited by Pound are legion, from the early collections, <span style="font-style:italic;">Des Imagistes</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Anthology</span> , up through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Active Anthology</span>  and including Chinese translations such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Classic Anthology Defined by Confucius</span> . In Spain, the importance of Gerardo Diego’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología Poética En honor de Góngora</span> , a collection that re-introduced Góngora to modernist poets, is well known.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> (This tradition was later extended, and eventually globalized, by the prose anthologies of Borges, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología de la literatura fantástica</span> , as well as his later self-anthologizations <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología personal</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nueva antología personal</span> , not to speak of his various “<span style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotecas</span>.”) In France we might mention Breton’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthologie de l’humour noir</span> , which attempted to archive a particularly “modern” sensibility of the comic. Stretching the concept, we might even suggest that the Brazilian modernist Oswald de Andraje’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifesto Antropófago</span> , with its call for the incorporation of foreign works into the body of Brazilian culture—ultimately to digest and so transform them—articulates an anthological program at the level of modernist culture as a whole. This brief list, which might easily be extended, suggests that the form is indeed endemic to modernist practice, and also indicates some points for comparison and differentiation with the Arabic experience.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It would be foolish to suppose that the anthology fulfills an identical function in these various national situations. But it is worth suggesting a common denominator to these disparate efforts, even if that commonality must be interrogated in turn to reveal local motives of each particular case. The pervasiveness of the anthology, I will argue, points to its effectiveness in accomplishing a necessary task of modernism—and one not well suited to the more theatrical genre of the manifesto—which is the re-writing of literary history.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	This characteristically melancholic exercise, an apparently impotent or unproductive brooding over the fragments of tradition, is especially obvious in anthologies such  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as those edited by Breton, Diego, or Adonis, which include some poetry of the past. In these works, poetic history is re-narrativized in the form of a collage. The texts of tradition, collected in the form of citations, are rearranged in new patterns, effecting what Frederic Jameson has called modernism’s “powerful displacement of previous narrative paradigms.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> A typical, if somewhat crude example of such displacement is Diego’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología poética en honor de Góngora,</span> a florilegium published in Madrid on the three hundredth anniversary of the Spanish poet’s death. The volume gathers a series of poems that display a common “magnetic attraction” toward the baroque master. <a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Arranged in strict chronological order, the poems are either dedicated explicitly to Góngora or written in imitation of his style. “<span style="font-style:italic;">Es casi una antología al revés</span>,” Diego explains, “<span style="font-style:italic;">la que busca en los autores, no su personel estilo en autónoma plenitud, sino su filiación y genealogía trabada hacia un antepasado, cuya atracción malogra en cierto modo su más genuina calidad</span>.” The benefit of such an “inside-out” anthology is that its depersonalized, genealogical narrative allows Diego to suggest that the <span style="font-style:italic;">el Góngorismo</span> is a modernist substratum, or core sample—“<span style="font-style:italic;">Este homenaje representa como un corte transversal en la geología de nuestra corteza poética durante tres siglos de evolución</span>,” he writes<span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>whose re-discovery in the present has the power to reshape the entire landscape of Spanish poetry.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> And so it is hardly by chance that the last two poems of the anthology are Don Jose Iglesias de la Casa’s “Letrilla,” published in 1793, and then Rubén Darío’s “Trebol” published in 1905. In this way, the blandly curatorial collecting and organizing of poems becomes a polemic against the nineteenth century—“<span style="font-style:italic;">el peor que ha conocido nuestra poesía</span>,” Diego remarks—though it does so negatively, by way of a displacement or repression. Diego’s anthology succeeds in rewriting, via citation, the history of Spanish poetry as one with a modernist <span style="font-style:italic;">telos</span>, here represented by the re and corpus of Darío.
      </p>
<p>
	We can find a more complex version of this narrative strategy, one marked by its own characteristic repressions, displacements, and reshufflings, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> of Adonis. I want to explore this narrative in some detail (since it has not been studied elsewhere, and is rather intricate) before inquiring after its ideological significance.
      </p>
<p>
	The three volumes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are arranged in chronological order, according to a well-established scheme of Arabic literary history. The first volume consists of excerpts from pre-Islamic (<span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span>) poets and the poets contemporaneous with Muhammad’s revelation (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-mukhaḍramūn</span>). The second volume includes poets from the eighth to eleventh century, the “golden era” of Abbasid rule. The last volume is dedicated to the nearly nine hundred year long decline [<span style="font-style:italic;">inḥiṭāṭ</span>], characterized by a poetry of “mere craft and artifice.” The last period ends, roughly, with the poetry of Khalīl Gibrān. For each volume Adonis wrote a lengthy introduction, the analyses of which are closely recapitulated in his 1971 book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Muqaddima lil-shi‘r al-‘arabī</span>..
      </p>
<p>
	The essay that introduces the first volume describes the ethos of pre-Islamic poetry. Adonis takes a famous phrase from the seventh-century poet, Tamīm bin Muqbil, to be paradigmatic: “Were that man was a stone” [<span style="font-style:italic;">law anna al-fatā ḥajr</span>]. It is a pithy condensation of what Adonis describes as a melancholic heroism at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> sensibility: the poet’s knowledge of life’s brevity and his obsessive desire to overcome it, even at  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the price of petrification.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The world of these early poets is absolutely profane: no Gods or spirits populate the wadis, and the poet “possesses nothing but the earth.” But the earth, which is in fact nothing but the desert, is essentially indifferent to the poet’s plight. It has no lessons to teach and no comfort to offer. Confronted by an impassive nature, or the mute ruins of an abandoned campsite (<span style="font-style:italic;">aṭlāl</span>), the poet’s typical response is a brash fatalism or stoic <span style="font-style:italic;">élan</span>. It is this sensibility that we find careening through the poetry itself. For Adonis, the pre-Islamic <span style="font-style:italic;">qaṣīda</span> is a kind of quest romance in which the hero “goes outside of his self in order to find himself”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  [Bin Muqbil’s phrase] reveals . . . a yearning for mastery over frailty and death. Discovering himself, the Arabic poet also discovers the absurdity of the world upon which, nevertheless, his destiny depends. So his self develops in a split oneness [<span style="font-style:italic;">wiḥda muzdawija</span>]: there is no link between the self and what it contemplates, and the more it contemplates, the greater its realization of the abyss that separates it from the world. When man’s separation from the things that surround him becomes clear, his own deficiency is also clarified, leading to a thirst for a completion that cannot be achieved except in the exterior world.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	So the poet’s coming-to-consciousness is inextricably bound up with consciousness-as- death. In Adonis’s telling, the pre-Islamic poet-hero discovers over and over again that nature is nothing more than a trap for his imagination. It is this extravagant will-to-timelessness that connects all genres of <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> poetry: just as the lyric poet of the <span style="font-style:italic;">qasīda</span> wants to become a stone in order to master time, so the ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">ūdhrī</span> love poet wants time (i.e., his night with the beloved) to freeze in place, to become a moment of permanent ecstasy.
      </p>
<p>
	The introductory essay to the second volume of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, which includes poetry from the eighth to eleventh centuries, postulates a decisive shift in the historical situation, which is the move from the nomadic life of the desert to the settled life of the towns. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">fourmillante cité</span> of ‘Abbasid Baghdad the poet is confronted not by an indifferent nature, but by an undifferentiated human mass that threatens to overwhelm him. Instead of embarking on an outwardly-directed quest, the poet therefore retreats into himself, spiritualizing nature and making it a reflection of his inner vision. Baghdad is where the poet discovers alienation and irony: “Feelings of alienation [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ghurba</span>] and disconnection from others—of being ‘an echo of life,’ as Abū Tammām expresses it—this is the sap that courses through the experience of Abī Nuwās, Abī Tammām, al-Mutanabbī and Abī al-‘Alā’ [al-Ma ‘arrī] . . . These feelings of alienation and disconnection are the context and motive for irony [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-sukhrīya</span>].”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Irony is, for Adonis, the master trope of ‘Abbasid poetry. It bears witness to the poet’s radical break with the urban crowd that impinges upon him, with the “other” that has become his “enemy.” At a stylistic level, this dissociation is signaled by the poet’s penchant for obscurity [<span style="font-style:italic;">alghum ūḍ</span>] and hermeticism. Adonis cites a famous anecdote from al-Ṣūlī’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Akhbār Abī Tammām</span>, in which the poet is asked by one of the uncomprehending masses, “Why do you not say that which is understood?” To which the poet haughtily responds, “Why do you not understand that which is said?” ‘Abbasid poetry is the result of this dialectic of interiorization and alienation: radically set off from his environment, the poet discovers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the self as an origin of the world: “He will choose alienation,” Adonīs writes of al-Mutanabbī, “believing that there is no greatness except in himself.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	This summary of Adonis’s narrative suggests how ingeniously he rewrites a conventional literary-historical narrative of pre-Islamic and ‘Abbasid poets in a manner that reproduces the categories of Romantic and Modernist (specifically, <span style="font-style:italic;">symboliste</span>) poetry. In the first period, the <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span>-Romantic era, the heroic imagination pits itself against an exteriorized nature in a sequence of quest adventures. In the second, the poet of Baghdad/Paris retreats into an interior world of analogies and symbols, whose impenetrability is a function of the poet’s estrangement from and superiority to the urban masses. Adonis’s rewriting thus serves as a sort of narrative <span style="font-style:italic;">trompe l’oeil</span>, making it seem as though Arabic modernism preceded by eleven centuries the French version on which it is clearly modeled. And in case the reader missed the point of this rewriting, Adonis asserts, in a comparison that has become notorious, that Abū Tammām, the most difficult and <span style="font-style:italic;">recherché</span> of all the classical poets, was the “Mallarmé of the Arabs,” and that Abū Nuwās, a libertine famous for his wine poetry, was the “Baudelaire of the Arabs.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Joseph Massad, one of the few critics who has written perceptively about the dilemmas of periodization in modern Arabic philosophy and historiography, notes that Adonis’s comparison “anachronistically render[s] Europe, not Arab-Islamic civilization, the reference.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> But it is probably more correct to say that the reference is not so much Europe, or the West, as “modernism” itself, whose temporality is more complex than the idea of anachronism can account for. By inserting the French model of <span style="font-style:italic;">symbolisme</span> into the Arabic tradition itself—by depositing it, one could say, into the archive of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology—</span>Adonis res his <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> as a kind of crypt, whose opening promises the shivery pleasure of something new (“modernism”) that was always-already there. The crypt, or museum, is indeed where poetry is conjured back to life. This uncanny kind of pleasure is also, I will argue, a elegiac one—a structure of feeling that points to the belatedness of Arabic modernism as a historical experience. And it is this belatedness that Adonis’s re of the <span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span> captures so well. It suggests a modernism that has not only already occurred, but one that has already been “institutionalized” (which is to say, theorized). In the last portion of this essay, we will look at how this theorization bears specifically on the editorial as opposed to narrative strategies of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>. But first we must ask what institution of modernism is at stake here, and attempt to sketch its historical coordinates.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Autonomy of the Aesthetic</h1>
<p>
	Classical tradition links the first <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> of Arabic poetry to reasons of state.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> According to one such tradition, it was the first Ummayad Caliph, Mu‘āwiya [d.680], who ordered the transmitters of verse, the court <span style="font-style:italic;">ruwāt</span>, to select a collection of exemplary poems—the so-called “Hanging Odes” (<span style="font-style:italic;">mu‘allaqāt</span>)—for his son to study in written form. A similar anecdote is told of a subsequent Ummayad Caliph, ‘Abd al-Malik [d.705]. This educational rite seems to have been transmitted across the change of dynasties. According to a later medieval tradition, it was the ‘Abbasid Caliph al-Manṣūr who  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> commanded the celebrated Kufan philologist al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḍabbī [d.780] to collect poems by lesser-known poets and teach them to his son, the future Caliph al-Mahdī. The resultant anthology, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mufaḍḍaliyāt</span>, was perhaps the most celebrated of all the early Arabic anthologies. In addition to providing a myth of royal <span style="font-style:italic;">bildung</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">adab</span>, this anecdotal tradition also narrates the transition from orality to literacy, from a poetic culture based upon the memorization of poems to one in which they are archived in written form.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> This transition, which inevitably recalls the Platonic mythology of the <span style="font-style:italic;">pharmakon</span>, obeys a similarly supplementary logic. In order to ensure the dynastic continuity of state and the transmission of culture from generation to generation, the caliph has recourse to the technology of writing. But this new art of memory, while preserving the traces of oral culture, also signifies the end of that culture and its own special techniques of memorialization. There is also a pleasing etymological wit to these narratives, since one common derivation of <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> is from the Arabic <span style="font-style:italic;">dawwana—</span>to collect, write down, or register—while another would return us to the Persian <span style="font-style:italic;">deve</span> (‘mad,’ ‘devil’), used to describe secretaries or state functionaries.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Later narratives of cultural transition or translation, including that of modernism, return obsessively to this primal scene and rewrite it in a variety of idioms. We have already seen how Adonis’s narrative of literary history, from <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> to ‘Abbasid poetry, allegorizes this same transition as a move from desert to the city, which sets the stage for the emergence of an urbanized Arabic modernism in the streets of eighth century Baghdad. A later stage of the narrative promises the renewal or rebirth [<span style="font-style:italic;">iḥyā’</span>] of that cultural moment in the pages of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, now red as a <span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf turāthī</span> [heritage museum], an institution whose supplementary logic should be clear. But it is now time to specify Arabic modernism’s own historical situation, as well as its peculiar “institutional” ideology, an ideology that distinguishes its allegorical operations from all previous and subsequent programs of rewriting.
      </p>
<p>
	This ideology is in fact the familiar modernist doctrine of aesthetic autonomy.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> I am not interested in rehashing debates about this ideology <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>. Instead, I want to examine its modalities and functions in a concrete case. Briefly, my argument in this section is that Arabic modernism, as an ideology of autonomization, attempts to differentiate itself from the institution of the post-colonial state [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>]—whose allegorical signifier for Adonis is “the caliphate”—and thereby secure direct, unmediated access to the modern.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Paradoxically, this access was sought via another mediating institution, which is the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> itself, now red as a cryptic site of putting-to-death and bringing-to-life. This contradiction of “mediated immediacy” sets in motion a process of differentiation within the institution of modernism itself, forcing it to differentiate itself not only from the state, but also from its rival ideologies. At a limit-point in this process, the institution of modernism is finally identified with that empty, purely ideological signifier, the individual subject (in Adonis’s terms, <span style="font-style:italic;">al-shakhṣ</span>).
      </p>
<p>
	It is because the role of the state and its cultural bureaucracy is so central to this argument that I began by recalling medieval anecdotal traditions about the new technology of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>, invented to ensure dynastic continuity at a moment of historical transition. These traditions—as well as another opposing series, concerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Ḥamāsa</span> of Abū Tammām, which I will mention at the end of this section—give us some coordinates for understanding Adonis’s conception of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> and its ideological function. Adonis argues, at the beginning of the introduction we have been reading, that his <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span> is intended to combat “a long-standing tradition” that has distorted the Arab reader’s relation to poetry:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  It is the tradition of politics, the state [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>], power struggles, and everything that accompanies them. This tradition still continues in one form or another and has greatly influenced a large portion of the rising generations. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology of Arabic Poetry</span> attempts an appeal to the heritage itself, immediately [<span style="font-style:italic;">bi-ṣūra mubāshira</span>], in order to disseminate beauty and poetry as these things were understood by the Arab poet, far from Caliph or Tribe, and to show that it is incorrect to delimit poetic work according to its political or creedal content. Nor it is possible to judge that work by political standards. This anthology consists of poetry that serves no school, creed, state or person. And for all that it is, itself, our poetic glory.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	We will see in the last section of this chapter how Adonis’s severing of the poet’s ties to caliph and tribe affects the editorial principles of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>. For now, we will take this passage as Adonis’s initial attempt to theorize a doctrine of aesthetic autonomy and poetry’s relation, or lack of relation, to <span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Adonis gives the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> a strikingly different function from the one it is given in the medieval anecdotes. Rather than ensuring the continuity of the state by transmitting cultural heritage from father to son, Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is meant to interrupt that dynastic tradition and unloose the ties that bind institutions of state to those of culture. This interruption, decentering the state vis-à-vis the poet, who now stands in splendid isolation, makes possible a direct relation to “the heritage itself ” (even though this heritage, as we saw in the preceding section, has already been rewritten in the idiom of modernism). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is thus red an institution of pure mediality, facilitating a link, but not interposing itself, between the reader and poetry, between the reader and poet. To conceive of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> in this way is to pretend that the whole editorial apparatus—its methods of selection, exclusion, reduction and rearrangement, as well as the prefatory material of the “Introductions” themselves—has no mediating role. It is to pretend that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s relation to the poetic heritage is a natural relation rather than an institutional one.
      </p>
<p>
	To represent a mediate relation as though it were an immediate one is, of course, the very definition of ideology, and I now want to sketch out the historical coordinates that made such an ideology possible and plausible. I will do so by drawing a necessarily schematic contrast between the national situations of Egypt and Lebanon between the years 1955–1975, which I take to be the period of poetic modernism.
      </p>
<p>
	In the Middle East, the characteristic development of this era was the centralization of power in the hands of the post-colonial state, typically under the auspices of socialist, or quasi-socialist, single-party regimes. This process of centralization was in one sense the continuation of Ottoman and colonial era policies, emphasizing a series of reforms that provided the state with increased powers of policing, led to the formalization of legal systems, and sought to incorporate religious institutions and offices into the civilian  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> apparatus. But the post-colonial era witnessed an acceleration of this centralizing tendency, giving the state vastly greater abilities to penetrate and shape the social fabric.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> The end point of this period (c.1975) coincides with the onset of so-called “correction” or “rectification.” The specifics of these policies varied from state to state, but in general they signaled the integration of heretofore protected national economies into the global market. While these programs did not always shrink the state, or force it to withdraw from the social, they did tend to fragment and internationalize the organs of economic decision-making, giving rise to new institutional actors, whether public (WTO, World Bank), or private (a new financial elite).
      </p>
<p>
	It was Egypt, following the Free Officers Coup of 1952, that enacted the most comprehensive program of centralization and provided a model to other states in the region. As a country with well-established administrative structures stretching back to reign of Muhammad Ali, Egypt was the first regime to undertake a program of land reform, systematic nationalizations, and armed force modernization. Other states in the region implemented their own versions of these policies, often at the instigation of Egypt, which encouraged state expansion in Syria during the three years of union (1958–61), and also in Iraq between 1963–64, when the two countries were also contemplating union in the wake of a coup by Nasserite officers. The drive toward centralization also extended into the cultural realm. In Egypt, the state was gradually able to assert what Anouar Abdel- Malek has termed “un monopole d’Etat virtuel sur la culture.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Richard Jacquemond, in an especially valuable study of relations between writers and state in Egypt, has given a more detailed, institutional history of how this monopoly was achieved:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  C’est à partir de 1956 que le régime nassérien, sorti renforcé de l’épreuve de Suez, met en place le système d’institutions par lequel il va s’assurer le contrôle et la mobilisation des intellectuels, système qui pour l’essentiel est encore en place. Création du Conseil supérieur des arts et des letters , du ministère de la Culture , expansion des institutions étatiques préexistants (dans le théâter ou la radiodiffusion), création de nouveaux organismes (la télévision en 1960), nationalisation de l’ensemble de la presse en 1960, du cinéma en 1961, d’une part importante de l’édition entre 1961 et 1965 . . . En somme, l’Etat des Officiers libres prolongeait une tradition ancienne de protection et de contrôle des artistes et intellectuels qu’il ne fit à la limite que systématiser.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	By multiplying its organs and extending their powers ever deeper into the social realm, the Egyptian state was gradually able to establish itself as sole mediating institution between Egyptian society and modernity.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The state’s “virtual monopoly” over the field of culture was a practical monopoly over the discourse of the modern. This explains why <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>, for Egyptian intellectuals during this period, has little or nothing to with the aesthetic autonomy championed by Adonis and his modernist movement. In Egypt, neither modernism nor modernity could be convincingly imagined outside the institution of the state.
      </p>
<p>
	The situation in Lebanon generally, and Beirut in particular, was different. Independence from France was achieved in 1947 with hardly any violence. The country’s merchant and banking elite had put aside sectarian differences long enough to shake  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hands on the National Pact of 1943, an unwritten agreement that formalized clientism as the law of the land. This same elite consistently opposed any measures of state centralization. <a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> A parliamentary system of inter-confessional bargaining was maintained in tandem with a politics of notables. Because the power of the elite depended on their ability to satisfy the needs of their followers personally, they rejected any attempt by the state to interpose its own administration and resources. Lebanon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">laissez-faire</span> economic policy was confirmed by its repeal of the Customs Union with Syria in 1950, and Beirut soon began to serve as an entrepôt between European and American markets and the newly oil-rich Gulf.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> The subsequent influx of international capital into Beirut was accompanied by a parallel influx of exiles and emigrés. Oppositional intellectuals from neighboring states took advantage of Lebanon’s porous borders and many political exiles, including Adonis, fled to Beirut in the early 1950s.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The city was a seemingly civil oasis in a region of hypertrophied states. In Beirut, intellectual and political projects could thus assert their autonomy from <span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span> and hope to set up a direct, unmediated link with <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Arabic modernism’s particular version of aesthetic autonomy, i.e., of institutional differentiation from the state, helps to explain one last feature of Adonis’s introductory narrative, which is his critique of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa.</span> The <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> (“revival,” “awakening,” “renaissance”) is a broad historical term referring to the various nineteenth century movements of intellectual reform that arose in response to the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The “shock” of this encounter with the West is typically supposed to have roused the Arab world from its dogmatic slumbers and thrust it violently into modernity. The problem posed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> to Arab modernists is thus similar, in some respects, to the problem posed by Romanticism to European modernists. In both cases, a movement fueled by innovation is confronted by a precursor movement of the previous century, whose claims to a practice of rupture, even when announced in an idiom of reform or revival, appear equally urgent as their own. In the case of Arabic modernism, a specifically Lebanese phenomenon, this agon was aggravated by the fact that the historical center of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> was Egypt. Egyptian intellectuals were the first to undertake translations of European technical and artistic works, from Fénélon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Télémaque</span> to Cruveilhier’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anatomie pathologique du corps humain</span>, in a manner that must have struck the modernists as all too reminiscent of their own project.
      </p>
<p>
	Modernism’s typical response to the difficulty posed by its Romantic or nahḍawist adversaries—a response that one might trace in the essays of T. S. Eliot, or Octavio Paz, as easily as in Adonis—is to undertake a process of internal differentiation, a movement of self-division and increasing specialization that allows modernism both to assert a continuity with the (re-written) past while distinguishing itself from rival precursors. In Adonis’s account, as we have seen, it is the tradition of Àbbasid poetry that is rewritten in a modernist idiom and then claimed for present purposes. At the same time, Adonis criticized Modernism’s chief rival, the (Egyptian) <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span>, for failing to wrest poetry free of its instrumentalization by the state—which, as we have seen, is the <span style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span> of modernism defined as an ideology of autonomization. As he writes in his introduction to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> did not offer, from our literary and poetic heritage, anything except works that vacillate between two tendencies: clichés and didactic parables on the one hand, and, on the other, politics and whatever is connected with it in the way of poems of praise and blame [<span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ wa hijā’</span>]. It did not provide us anything except works in which the individuality of the poet [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat al-shā‘ir</span>], his own views and experiences, does not come to the fore. Rather, what comes to the fore is the character of the society [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat al-mujtama‘a</span>]: its habits, traditions and established conventions. Works, in other words, that cannot possibly benefit a true poetic renaissance [<span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa sh‘irīya ḥaqqan</span>].<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	Let me further suggest that the poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span>, criticized here for their imbrication with politics, should be understood as allegorical res contemporary rivals. These rivals are the nationalist poets (many of them Nasserists and in that sense “Egyptian”), whose committed, political verse is hereby excluded from the realm of poetry.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> In this way, all possible positions in the contemporary field of Arab poetics, whether romantic, modernist, or nationalist/Marxist, are emplotted in Adonis’s narrative. Even the unarchived poetry of the present is, at least allegorically, accounted for.

	It is the very comprehensiveness of this narrative, its urge to tally up and catalogue the entirety of poetic experience—an encyclopedic instinct that reaches its climax in the four volumes of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil—</span>that begs the question of modernism’s own institution. Separately from the state, or caliphate, how are we to imagine the archive, institution, or anthology (all possible translations for “<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>”) of the modern?
      </p>
<p>
	Still lingering with the passage cited above, I would suggest that we are asked to imagine this institution in the re of “the individuality of the poet” [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat alsh ā‘ir</span>]. We have seen how Adonis weans poetry, in the name of its autonomization, away from institution after institution, beginning with the tribe and caliphate and ending with the nation state. The re of the individual, <span style="font-style:italic;">al-shakhṣ</span>, is in this sense whatever is left over from modernism’s relentless process of differentiation. He is a re of <span style="font-style:italic;">difference</span> in the mathematical sense of the word: the result of a process of subtraction. The non-institutionalized subject is hollowed-out, purely abstract (no matter how one tries to fill it with “views and experiences”). This properly ideological re, a hero of modernism, is already hinted at in the notion of a poet who dwells far from Caliph or tribe and who provides the discerning reader with immediate access to the heritage that is <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>.
      </p>
<p>
	With this mention of the isolated poet, the visionary nomad or alienated urbanite, we return to the tradition of medieval anecdotes with which we began this section. Alongside those anecdotes that re the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> as a new technique of transmission and dynastic continuity there is another, complementary group of anecdotes, which cluster around two anthologies of the ‘Abbasid poet, Abū Tammām, “Mallarmé of the Arabs,” as Adonis calls him. Abū Tammām’s ninth century collection of pre-Islamic and early Islamic poetry, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān al-Ḥamāsa</span>, was medieval <span style="font-style:italic;">succès de scandale</span>. According to one count, it received at least thirty classical commentaries.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Adonis was well aware of Abū Tammām’s compilations. He names them specifically, at the beginning of his introduction, as the sole models for his own editorial efforts: “All the anthologies  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that preceded this one, with the exception of Abū Tammām’s s two <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>, were conventional. They only confirmed the reigning standards and common taste.” This assertion of continuity with the ‘Abbasid period, an assertion that leaps heroically over the intervening twelve centuries, is a typical and by now unsurprising gesture. But there are other reasons why Adonis might allude to Abū Tammām’s anthologies.
      </p>
<p>
	Here is a tradition related by the eleventh century critic Yaḥyāibn ‘Alī āl-Tibrīzī, given in the introduction to his commentary on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Abū Tammām was returning from Khurasān on his way back to Iraq when he came to Hamadhān. There, Abū al-Wafā’ ibn Salama availed himself of the opportunity to invite Abū Tammām to stay as his guest. It happened one day that there was a huge snowfall that cut off the roads making travel impossible. This distressed Abū Tammām but delighted Abū al-Wafā’, who said, ‘Make yourself at home here, for it will be a long time before the snow is cleared,’ and took him to his library. So Abū Tammām read and studied until, within the space of one month, he had compiled five books of poetry, among them the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Waḥshiyyāt</span>.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The image of Abū Tammām, cocooned in his friend’s library while a snowstorm rages over the Alvand range is a neat pendant to the cliché of the desert raider. In Adonis’s terms, it is a typically “modernist” image: the heroic quester has retired to the solitude of his study. But this bookish isolation points up an important difference with the previous series of anecdotes. For whereas earlier canonical anthologies were compiled at court, Abū Tammām is imagined here as composing his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> far from the institutional luxuries of Baghdad. The exaggeratedly marginal setting for the anecdote may be taken as a narrative explanation for the anthology’s famously innovative editorial methods, methods that would seem to depend more on the poet’s individual tastes than the conventions of philology. Rather than arranging the poems, as was customary, <span style="font-style:italic;">‘ala al-rijāl</span> (according to the poet), Abū Tammām’s anthology is arranged ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">ala al-abwāb</span> (by topoi), with sections devoted to fortitude in battle [ḥ<span style="font-style:italic;">amāsa</span>], elegy [<span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span>], love and the vituperation of women, among others. He ignored traditional principles such as chronology or tribal affiliation and juxtaposed poets of different eras and regions on the same page. Still more strangely, many poems are excerpted—the typical entry is only three to five lines long—their lines rearranged, and sometimes two different poems were combined into one.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Many commentators even suspected Abū Tammām of interpolating his own word choice where the poet’s seemed to him deficient. All these innovations point to a break with the philological probity of court transmitters like al-Mufaḍ ḍal al-Ḍabbī, who were anxious to preserve the original, oral version of a poem before it fell into oblivion. Abū Tammām, burrowing into the archive of his friend’s library, does not worry about the pathos of origins or oblivion. In a culture of writing, poetry can be rearranged, rewritten, and even re-attributed.
      </p>
<p>
	It is perhaps to this historical and technological transition that another eleventh century critic, Aḥmad Ibn Muḥammad al-Marzū qī, refers to when he suggests that, “If God brought them back to life, the poets [included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>] would perhaps follow Abū Tammām and submit to him”—i.e., they would submit to his editorial decisions.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> This brief eschatological fantasy of al-Marzūqī is one that would appeal to Adonis.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> It invites us to think of the anthology as a historical, or indeed divine tribunal. The poets of the past are resurrected—as in a sense they are, in the form of citations—and submit to the judgment of the living anthologist. It is the present that will judge the past, not according to a philological concept of authenticity, but rather according to the needs and standards of the moment. The poets of the yesterday will “follow” [<span style="font-style:italic;">yatba‘ūn</span>] the poet of today. This paradox suggests a very different notion of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> than the one linking it to the dynastic institution of the state. In that version, the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> worked to secure a continuity between past and present, oral and written, pre-Islamic and postrevelation, father and son. In the final section of this chapter, I show how Adonis’s conception of the anthologist is more like to the re sketched here by al-Marzū qī, a rewriter and resurrector of spirits, an elegiac tribunal of history.

<p>
	    In this final section I try to show how the various narrative and ideological arguments of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are translated into a series of editorial principles that are as radical as they are comprehensive. I argue that the rewriting of poetic <span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span> according to the ideology of aesthetic autonomy results in a particular economy of genres, one defined by its repressions fully as much its inclusions and innovations. The purpose of this exposition is two-fold. First, it seeks to show that the form of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān—</span>its narrative, ideological and editorial components—is a tightly structured whole, an integrity that I take to be symptomatic of modernism’s commitment to totality. The second purpose of the exposition is frankly revisionary. By emphasizing Adonis’s efforts as an editor or anthologist rather than as a poet, it seeks to complicate the usual, Promethean portrait of Adonis that critics have been repeating now for many years.
	  </p>
<p>
	    We have seen how a logic of differentiation leads Adonis finally to claim that the poet himself, the poet as a re of absolute isolation, is the origin and medium of poetry’s transmission. It is only by stripping away the mummy clothes of history and politics that the reader is put in contact with the poetic tradition as such. This tradition can only be transmitted by the efforts of poets who conduct their labors far away from the court or the state, whether in a private library in Hamadhān, or in the magazine culture of modernizing Beirut. So it is no surprise that this re is also taken as a kind of editorial compass point: “In selecting these poems,” Adonis writes, “I have followed the thread that links us to the character of the poet—to his worries, joys, pains and own individual life [<span style="font-style:italic;">ḥayāti-hi huwwa</span>]—without consideration for politics or reigning societal values: the thread that links us to the individual, not the society; to creativity, not history; to poetry, and not the topic [<span style="font-style:italic;">mawḍū‘</span>] of poetry.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    How does this individualist principle get translated into practical, editorial terms? What are the kinds of poems it selects for, and what kinds does it exclude? Adonis explains that it is chiefly a matter of genre:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      I must indicate that I am inclined to consider the poem of praise [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-madḥ</span>] and the poem of blame [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-hijā’</span>], as well as things similar or somehow connected to them, a part of our political and social history, not part of our poetic history. I do not evaluate poetry according to its topics. Rather, its value is determined by its manner of expression and the extent to which it complies with contemporary poetic values and with my understanding of poetry.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    This exclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> from a <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> that claims to represent the poetic heritage as such—whose criterion for inclusion is simply whether or not the poem is poetic—is why I call Adonis’s editorial principles radical. An enormous amount of the classical poetic corpus, perhaps the very core of it, from Ka‘ab bin Zuhayr’s “Banat Su‘ād” to al-Mutanabbī’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Sayfīyāt</span>, belongs to these two genres. Even in the relatively unorthodox case of Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>, of the 261 selections there are eighty <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> poems and thirty-two <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span>, each of which has a separate chapter. The motive for Adonis’s exclusion, or repression, is clear: it is meant to purify the poetic tradition of politics (Adonis’s late modernist translation, perhaps, of the Mallarméan dictum, <span style="font-style:italic;">donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu</span>). And indeed, the volumes of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span> are strikingly devoid of <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span>. Even in the case of poems that do belong to these genres—Abū Tammām’s “Ode to Armorium,” for example, a praise poem for the caliph al-Mu‘taṣim—the sections of explicit praise have been edited out.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Before looking at what is left, what we might term the melancholic remnant, we should pause for a moment to consider the look of the poems on the page. In contrast to medieval or nineteenth-century anthologies, invariably equipped with a bulky apparatus of philological commentary, the pages of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are remarkably clean. Vocalizations are kept to a minimum, there is no marginalia, no help given with difficult words, and no context provided for the occasion of the poem (the ancient critics often did supply a context, typically anecdotal or legendary). I take it that this way of constructing the page, a method of abstraction or subtraction, is a corollary of Adonis’s argument for poetic autonomy. That is, the exaggeratedly large blank spaces are allegories of the reader’s solitude: here, on the page, is where he or she confronts “the heritage itself.”
	  </p>
<p>
	    But what, finally, does this heritage consist of when stripped of its institutions, its historical occasions and cloak of philological commentary? My argument is that it consists of a poetics of melancholy. This is hinted at, first of all, from the fact that the elegy [<span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span>] is the only classical genre that survives in Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, a text that is strewn with elegies for sons, brothers, friends, and heroes. This <span style="font-style:italic;">survivance</span> is surprising enough, given modernism’s vigorous resistance to all generic conventions.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>’s own resistance to, or repression of genre (and not just those of <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span>) is otherwise implacable. Take, for example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>’s method of categorization. While the poems are arranged chronologically, by author, each individual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> poem or excerpt is given a thematic title by Adonis, none of which betray the genre to which the poem belongs: “Today and Yesterday,” “Woman,” “Confusion,” “Rain,” “Despair.” Among these renamed and rearranged fragments of the generic tradition, elegy subsists like some stubborn, unreconstructed truth, a remnant of the social that has not yet been broken down and reconred. The economy of genre is in this sense also an economy of repression, in which the repressed object—here, politics itself— becomes a motive for melancholy.
	  </p>
<p>
	    This is how I would name and explain the mood that is conjured up by the poems of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>. It is a mood whose subject is almost exclusively interested in passing things. The world of these poems is a world headed for extinction, or else it is already extinct. Here, for example, is one ninth century poet’s evocation of a rose: “A visitor, guiding himself to us each year, / A handsome face, chastely perfumed, an intimate of wine [<span style="font-style:italic;">ilf al-mudām</span>] / Fifty days old, he goes in peace” [‘Alī bin Jahm, d.863].<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> And in many cases the manifold of these poems—clouds, rain, women, settlements and cities—is only remembered, its sensual plenitude a function of its being past. “My eye quivered [<span style="font-style:italic;">ikhtalajat ‘aynī</span>] and then I saw him, as if my eye had knowledge of absent things” [Ibrāhīm bin al-‘Abbās al-Ṣūlī, d.861].<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> The incipient tear of grief brings a visionary clarity, a knowledge of hidden or invisible things. In this way the erotic nostalgia of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span>, in which the poet laments the beloved’s absence over the traces of her abandoned campsite, or the dry-eyed calm of the <span style="font-style:italic;">zuhd</span>, in which the ascetic counsels equanimity in the face of life’s brevity, merge into one structure of feeling. Under this Saturnine gaze, alternately tearful or stoic, the hieroglyphics of history are transformed into still lifes, a collection of <span style="font-style:italic;">memento morii</span>: “Why do the graves not answer when the melancholic [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ka‘īb</span>] calls out to them? / Holes roofed by stones and sand dunes, / Inside are parents, children, youths and old men. / So many lovers to whose parting my soul was unreconciled” [Abū al-’ Atāhiya, d.862].<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> In the introduction to his anthology, writing of the pre-Islamic poets, Adonis takes this structure of feeling as a guiding principle, what he calls “the awareness of fate” [ <span style="font-style:italic;">ḥiss al-dahr</span>]:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      What I mean by fate is an overwhelming power that one cannot t against. It takes away all things, transforms all things. Confronted by this power, the poet feels impotent and out-schemed. It is not the power of death, but a dynamic, leveling force that carries absence in its wake: absence of the beloved, of settlements, of relatives and the tribe . . . This explains the rooted melancholy [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ka‘ āba al-mujadhdhara</span>] in the Arab spirit and in Arabic poetry. For the Arab, melancholy is an authentic, natural wellspring.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	    It is the skillfulness of Adonis’s editing that makes this claim so plausible, and if I insist again that the melancholy of this tradition is not in any sense natural or “authentic,” but rather an ideological projection, then my insistence should also be understood as an acknowledgement of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s suasive powers and imaginary satisfactions. Let me suggest one last way of registering this projection, what we might call an elegiac ideology, in an effort to gather some strands of my argument and round it off.
	  </p>
<p>
	    I have already noted the exemplary role played by Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> is Adonis’s conceptions of modernism, anthology, and the handing down (or interruption)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of tradition. Now I would suggest that one of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s most ambitious agendas is to rewrite the great ‘Abbasid poet, via citation, as an elegist. Abū Tammām is clearly at the center of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, not only as a model anthologist, but also as a poet: we are given 78 excerpts from his <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, second only to Abū Nūwās, who has 91 (al-Mutannabī has only 40). Adonis’s elegiac revision is ambitious, in the first place, because of Abū Tammām’s reputation as the greatest of the ‘Abbasid panegyrists. Most of these efforts are, as we might have expected, simply excluded from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>. A more subtle approach is taken with what is perhaps Abū Tammām’s most famous poem, his “Ode to Amorium,” a <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> that commemorates the caliph al-Mu‘taṣim’s sack of the Byzantine stronghold in 838. Adonis cites ten lines of the poem [11–12; 25–33], which are drawn from the poet’s description of the city before and after the Muslim armies attacked it and set it afire. The caliph’s victory over the city is red as a rape of its inhabitants (“For on that day the sun did rise upon no man but chaste, nor set upon a virgin”), and the last lines quoted by Adonis portray a scene of ruin:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The city in her ruins looked as lovely Mayy’s haunts, in their heyday to Ghaylan. Her cheek, though streaked with grime, appeared as tempting as cheeks aflush with maiden modesty</span>.
	    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Gazing on her disrement, no need had we of beauty or of pleasing sights</span>.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    The effect of Adonis’s editorializing is, I think, to make a poem written in praise of the caliph into an elegy for the city he has destroyed.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> With a typical melancholy flourish, the beauty of that city, red now as a woman, is only revealed in post-bellum retrospect. Our sense for the importance of elegy to Adonis’s revision of the ‘Abbasid poet is strengthened by the number of his explicit elegies that are excerpted, which amounts to one fifth of the total poems cited.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What is the effect of rewriting heritage in the idiom of elegy? This question returns us to the paradox with which I began, which is modernism’s attempt to hand down tradition in the mode of its interruption. I noted how this paradox, or memory crisis, was red in the “institution” of a museum, a cryptic site for both the putting-to-death and bringing-back-to-life of the work of art. In the elegist, we have another such re. For it is the institution, or genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span> that points both to impossibility of handing down the <span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>, as well as to its fitful life in the present. In Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, the heritage survives in the form of a citation, or ambiguous whisper. I will end by citing one of Adonis’s citations of Abū Tammām, a fragment that he titles “Elegy for a Son.” Here, in an uncanny scene of life-in-death and death-in-life, the poet elegizes what was to have been the future, but which is now falling indelibly into the past:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The last time I saw him, Death had thrown him low, prostrate with sickness. His choked plaints caught in his throat, his cries turning each around the other, Echoes that turned the tongue on itself. Death would not let him speak clearly. His eyes now turned fixedly upwards, his eyelids flickering closed.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>

		On the trope of “clinging” [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-tamassuk</span>] to tradition, see Adonis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Al-thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil</span>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed., 4 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-‘Awda), vol. 1, 98–104. Here, Adonis traces this gesture back to the first Muslim conquests and the ensuing confrontation between Bedouin culture and the urbanized civilization of Sassanid Persia. In the second section of the essay we will see how this confrontation is re-staged, in the anecdotal literature on anthologies, as one between two mnemonic techniques, one oral and the other written.

		The stone is also a keyword in Adonis’s early poetry. Take, for example his three-line poem, “<span style="font-style:italic;">ḥajar</span>” [Stone], from <span style="font-style:italic;">Aghānī Mihyār al-Dimashqī</span>: “I worship this gentle stone [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-Ḥajar al-wādi‘a</span>]. / I see my face in its lineaments [<span style="font-style:italic;">taqāṭī‘i-hi</span>]. / I see in it my lost poetry [<span style="font-style:italic;">shi‘rī al-ḍā’i‘</span>].” “<span style="font-style:italic;">Wādi‘</span>” [“gentle”], in the first line, is an unexpected and suggestive word, since it also bears melancholic connotations of farewell (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-wadā‘</span>) and archival ones of deposition and storing (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-wad‘</span>). In the second line, the poet handles the stone as if it were a mirror, or a skull in which he witnesses his own fragmentation: <span style="font-style:italic;">taqāṭī‘i-hi‘ al-wajh</span> [lineaments of the face] is an idiom, but the singular <span style="font-style:italic;">taqā. ti‘</span> signifies interruption, fragmentation, discontinuity. All of these ambiguities resonate in the final line, in which the poet discovers that the verse he bid farewell to (or perhaps never wrote) has been inventoried or inscribed in the stone. The stone as an object of “worship” is in this sense a kind of profane fetish or melancholic emblem of a world without divinities, which is why it belongs equally to the pre-Islamic world of the <span style="font-style:italic;">jahilī</span> poets as well as the post-religious world of Mihyar. On the stone as melancholic emblem, see Walter Benjamin, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origin of German Tragic Drama</span> (New York: Verso, 1998), 203–205.

	      The analogy between Baudelaire and Abū Nuwās occasions a further piece of ingenuity, when Adonis explicates the Arab poet’s occult theory of “<span style="font-style:italic;">tashābuhāt</span>” (similitudes, analogies) in a way that asks us to translate the word as “<span style="font-style:italic;">correspondences</span>.” See <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, vol. 2, 15.

And following Bürger’s terminology, I would argue that Arabic modernism was not in fact an avant-gardist movement.

Poetry acquires its ultimate value from itself [<span style="font-style:italic;">min dākhili-hi</span>], from a richness of experience and expressivity, not from outside, from what it reflects or expresses . . .

		The elite was also fortunate to inherit a relatively feeble colonial state. France, the poorer of the two European powers during the inter-war years, had run Lebanon on an especially tight budget. In the interests of economy, it left educational and medical needs to be provided on a communal basis. See Roger Owen, “The Political Economy of Grand Liban 1920–1970,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Essays of the Crisis in Lebanon</span>, ed. Roger Owen (London: Ithaca Press, 1976), 24–25.

		It is a commonplace to think of Lebanon as History’s perennial middle-man. In fact this is an invented tradition and can be traced to the writings of the Lebanese nationalist Michel Chiha—a banker, who also first coined the ideologeme of “the merchant republic.” On this point, see Michelle Hartman, “’The First Boat and the First Oar’: Inventions of Lebanon in the Writings of Michel Chiha,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Radical History Review</span>, no. 86 . It is true that Lebanon has for some time functioned as a node of trade rather than its origin or end, but the difference between serving as an intermediary between the silk producers of Syria and European markets, which was the primary use for Lebanese ports throughout the nineteenth century and up through the Great Depression, and serving as the intermediary between Gulf oil wells and American markets, as Beirut did after WWII, involves a paradigm shift rather than a smooth transition.

	      Others, of course, did not flee because they were put in jail. Here is perhaps the place to acknowledge that the history of modernism in Arabic literature—a literature produced, for the most part, outside the prison—is at all points shadowed by this other, more violent history, whose ideological and aesthetic coordinates have only begun to be charted.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f47" href="#f47-text">47. </a>
	      In this sense the institutions of Arabic modernism—in the form of an anthology like Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, or modernist magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Shi‘r</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mawāqif—</span>and the famous Palestinian “state within a state” are radically contemporary projects. Nor is it coincidental that both experiments were brought to term at roughly the same historical juncture, when the civil war exposed the contradictions of Lebanon’s era of <span style="font-style:italic;">convivencia</span>.

	      Adonis’s identification of Egyptian poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> with a contemporary strain of political poetry is clear in Adonis’s chapter in on Samī al-Bārūdī’ in <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil</span> (vol. 4, 39–53). al-Bārūdī’ was the most prominent Egyptian poet of the nineteenth century and the editor of a celebrated anthology in his own right—the four volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Mukhtārāt al-Bārūdī</span>’, published in 1909—and therefore doubly a rival. In <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil</span> Adonis writes of al-Bārūdī’, dean of the <span style="font-style:italic;">naḥ da</span>: “There is no doubt al-Bārūdī”s poetry had a revivalist function, meaning that it was a technical revision of the past. And this revival may well have carried some political-patriotic significance, in the sense that it encouraged self-confidence and resolution in the face of the enemy, or in the struggle against him. So it might be said that al-Bārūdī’s poetry played a prominent role in the raising of national consciousness. But this role is not, technically speaking, poetic,”.

	      Adonis also admits to rearranging his lines: “I have not always maintained the succession of verses in the poem,” he writes at the end of his first introduction, “at times moving a verse forward,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and times dropping it back in order to establish the structure of the verses and sequence of thoughts.

		On this point, Jameson has written, “The reaction against genre theory in recent times is a strategic feature of what must be called <span style="font-style:italic;">the ideology of modernism</span>.” See his “Magic Narratives: Romance as Genre,” <span style="font-style:italic;">NLH 7</span> , 135. Muḥammed Luṭfī al-Yūsufī argues, in a more modernist vein, that the classical system of genres was itself a method for the “domestication” [<span style="font-style:italic;">tadjīn</span>] of poetry. See Muḥammad Luṭfī al-Yūsufī, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fitnat al-mutakhayyal</span> (Beirut: al-Mu’assasa al-<span style="font-style:italic;">‘</span>Arabīya lil-Dirāsāt wa-l-Nashr, 2002)., vol. 1, 226–27.

This trope of questioning the silent stones is another point of convergence between <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">zuhd</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rithā’</span>. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span> it is not the gravestones that are questioned, but the traces of the beloved’s camp, the <span style="font-style:italic;">ṣumm khawālid</span> [mute immortals] of Labīd’s <span style="font-style:italic;">mu‘allaqa</span>. Interestingly, a <span style="font-style:italic;">rithā’</span> that evokes this trope, Muatmmim bin Nuwayra’s elegy for his brother Mālik, is anthologized in both Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> (no. 265) and the first volume of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> . The poem has been commented on by Stetkyvetch (319–321), whose translation I use here: “My companion reproached me for weeping at the graves, for the flow of tears poured forth. / He said, ‘Do you weep at every grave you see for a grave that lies between al-Liwā and Dawānik?’ / I replied, ‘Grief evokes grief, so let me be, for every grave is a grave of Mālik.” On elegiac questioning in the Western tradition see Peter M.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Out of the Archive</span> provides a regular forum for the publication of rare or little-known documents concerning the history of modernism and the avant-gardes. Its compass is global and its aim is to prompt critical reflection on how the past’s material remains shape present understandings.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      During the 1910s and the 1920s, Iakov Aleksandrovich Tugendkhol’d (1882–1928) was one of the main connoisseurs and interpreters of modern Western art in Russia, and later in the Soviet Union. From 1902 to 1913, he lived in Munich and Paris, attended the studio of Alexej von Jawlensky and the Académie Ranson, became the Parisian correspondent for the literary and artistic journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollon</span>, and published books on Puvis de Chavannes , <span style="font-style:italic;">French art and its representatives</span> , and the Serge Shchukin collection of modern art. Upon his return to Russia, he reviewed attentively albeit often sceptically the contemporary Russian art scene, with a particular interest in the decorative and monumental values in Natalia Goncharova’s paintings,<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> and an eager admiration for Marc Chagall that led to a monograph .<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the Bolshevik revolution, Tugendkhol’d was active as art critic and editor for <span style="font-style:italic;">Izvestiia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaia Niva</span>, and as art history and heritage scholar at the Academy of Artistic Sciences and other state institutions. In 1925 he took part in the organisation of the Soviet section at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes</span> in Paris. In addition to a monograph on Alexandra Exter (Berlin, 1922), he continued publicizing modern Western art in books on Van Gogh , Degas , <span style="font-style:italic;">The First Museum of New Western Painting</span> (1923, former Shchukin collection), and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Artistic Culture of the West</span> . Excerpts from Tugendkhol’d’s extensive writings have become available in English only very recently.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The essay “In the Iron Dead-End” appeared in the summer of 1915 in the liberal literary and political monthly <span style="font-style:italic;">Severnye zapiski</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Notes from the North</span>) to which Tugendkhol’d had been contributing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> since 1913.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> While the general framework of the text is set by the First World War and its relation to Futurist aesthetics, its immediate topics originate in two 1915 events: the series of improvised and rather radical assemblage-based on-site interventions that disturbed the muscovite group exhibition <span style="font-style:italic;">The Year 1915;</span><a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the inclusion of several transrational (<span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span>’) poems by Alexey Kruchenykh together with a study of Vasily Kamensky’s “ferro-concrete” poetry<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> in the new literary almanac <span style="font-style:italic;">Strelets</span> [The Archer].<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Tugendkhol’d asserts his strong disagreement with the idiosyncrasy of the poems, as well as with the arbitrariness of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s, Mikhail Larionov’s, and—above all—Vladimir Tatlin’s post-Cubist constructions (and in doing so, provides the modern scholar of the history of exhibition practices with precious depictions of these ephemeral, little known yet significant actions).
    </p>
<p>
      The article sets forth an informed cross-cultural comparison between the development of modern art in Europe—since the impressionist dissolution of the pictorial unity via Cézanne’s quest of solidity up to the cubist investigation of shapes and volumes—, and the appropriation of these new trends in Russia.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> But its focus smoothly shifts away from the critique of the somewhat radical provincialism of Russian artists, to a discussion of the state of art and literature and their social functions. The object-like assemblages and futurist poems thus become symptoms of a crisis in the social relations between individuals. Hence the metaphor of the “iron dead-end” stands not merely for Tatlin’s constructions of everyday materials<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> nor solely for Kamensky’s “ferro-concrete poems,” but for the loss of shared values in an eclectic urban society that evolves around individualism. In a similar way as the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau had pleaded, two decades earlier, that emotions were the sole basis of a functional social network, and that the great mission of art and the artists was to affect emotionally their beholders in order to build and maintain a social space based on shared emotions,<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Tugendkhol’d mourns the loss of affect when confronting discrete modern artworks as the defeat of communication—and communion—between people. He finds an antidote to the dead-end of futurism in the re of Aliosha, the youngest of Dostoevsky’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Brothers Karamazov</span>, whose innocence, piety, and love for the others he deems constituent of a “Russian soul.” Ultimately, the renewal of both art and the country seem to rely upon a conjunction of aesthetic, Christian, and national values grounded in the belief that artworks should lead to a quasi-transcendent experience; that art, like religion, should lead the viewer to salvation by engaging her feelings.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Rather unknown today, Tugendkhol’d’s complex and ambiguous text is just as important in stance and position as Alexander Benois’s subsequent diatribe against Malevich and his <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span> as the “new icon” of suprematism.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> While in both cases art forms are conceived of as embodiment of values, “In the Iron Dead-End” offers a rare focus on assemblage-driven art practices<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> and a hitherto neglected avant-garde exhibition. Both modern and conservative, it testifies to the overlap of artistic, moral, political, and religious issues within the context of early capitalism. I hope it can appeal to scholars interested in cultural transfers as well as in the history of beliefs prompted by art practices.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The official exhibition listed 237 works by 28 artists but Tugendkhol’d’s essay focuses mainly on the participants <span style="font-style:italic;">hors catalogue</span>, merely giving a mild mention to the members of the formerly provocative group <span style="font-style:italic;">The Knave of Diamonds</span> (Il’ia Mashkov, Piotr Konchalovsky, Robert Fal’k).

      Well before the great nineteenth-century scientist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) published <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Sensations of Tone</span> , a groundbreaking work on the physical and physiological basis of musical effects, acousticians had proven that the perception of sound requires a medium.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Whether conceived as particles or waves, sound is material, and thus must be borne by a physical element, such as air or water. Helmholtz radicalized this point in the opening pages of his work: since a stimulus causes particles of air (<span style="font-style:italic;">Lufttheilchen</span>) to vibrate, and those vibrations produce a sensation in our ears (a musical tone or noise), the individual particles of air are themselves what we call sound.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The medium is literally the message.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The study of physical acoustics, which would later come to include architectural acoustics, deals with the external space in which acts of hearing take place, as opposed to physiological acoustics, which is concerned more intimately with the ear and the nerve sensations it receives, and psychological acoustics, which examines the mental process of transforming an auditory sensation into an image or concept. The medium connects the vibrating body and the ear, and the mind transforms these auditory sensations (<span style="font-style:italic;">Gehörempfindungen</span>) into perceptions (<span style="font-style:italic;">Vorstellungen</span>). Consequently, physical and physiological acoustics must be attentive to the setting in which sounds are produced and perceived, since this space gives form to the medium. To ignore the space of hearing is to ignore the sounds themselves, since they are not only conditioned by, but <span style="font-style:italic;">consist</span> in the space in which they are heard. The process of generating sounds  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> involves the subtle alteration of spatial composition; these transformations are what we perceive when we hear. Such slight changes to spatial conration are invisible and usually intangible—though certain loud and deep sounds, such as a bass line, can generate palpable vibrations in the whole body—but they are sensible to the ear.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> At a limit, audition could be defined as the perception of otherwise insensible transformations of space.
    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">On the Sensations of Tone</span> was essential to scientific and musical research on sense perception, not least because it was one of the earliest treatises on sound and space. Before the mid-1800s, there were of course splendid examples of acoustically successful buildings (churches, theaters, opera houses), but few theories to explain why certain structures had “good sound” while others did not.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Helmholtz’s interest in the spatial determination of auditory perception paved the way for Harvard physics professor Wallace Sabine (1868–1919), the so-called father of architectural acoustics, whose early work was devoted to solving the difficulties of understanding speech in university auditoria. Helmholtz also broke ground by trying to establish the scientific principles behind possibly the most abstract form of art, music. In this too he must be considered a precursor to Sabine, who designed Boston’s celebrated Symphony Hall, which opened in 1900. This was the first building designed according to acoustical laws and with the help of mathematical formulas for such phenomena as reverberation and the transmission of sound through walls (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 4, 13–57). If for Sabine the shape, size, and material of building were of paramount concern, for Helmholtz it was above all human physiology that determined auditory processes. Together, their work can be understood to stand for a thorough reimagining of the relationship between sound and space—both bodily and architectural—in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
    </p>
<p>
      Helmholtz’s work on acoustics immediately preceded the invention of numerous electro-acoustic devices, such as the loudspeaker (Siemens, 1874), the telephone (Bell, 1876) and the phonograph (Edison, 1877), and Sabine’s work coincided with the rise of radio broadcasting (c. 1920) and the invention of sound film (mid-1920s), not to mention the widespread use of the devices invented at the end of the previous century. This convergence of theoretical and practical developments in the realm of acoustics made their work all the more resonant. People were experiencing sound in radically new ways at a time when the scientific, musical, and architectural discourses of sound were redefining the way it was conceived—most broadly and pervasively, in its relationship to space. According to architectural historian Emily Thompson, the single most prominent feature of the “Soundscape of Modernity,” as her book is entitled, was its

	reformulation of the relationship between sound and space [ . . . ]. As scientists and engineers engaged increasingly with electrical representations of acoustical phenomena, sounds became indistinguishable from the circuits that produced them.

<p class="continued">
	In modernity, then, sound <span style="font-style:italic;">became</span> space. Whether one calls space a context, a medium, a channel or a circuit, the point remains the same: sound without space is not only inaudible, it is unthinkable.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The aim of this essay is to explore the literary implications of this linking of sound and space in modernity. By examining works by three major German modernist authors—Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Franz Kafka—this essay will first of all demonstrate the interconnected discourses of sound and space in their texts. These writers are fascinated by the sensory challenge posed by indeterminate or unusual sounds (jumbled noises, incomprehensible voices, discordant music), particularly in the context of constructed enclosures, such as buildings, rooms, and underground caverns. In their works hearing defines or is defined by the physical structures in which it takes place. Whether architecture or the ear occupies the position of mastery is an open question: sound can appear as a product of architectural space, or it can reveal or even generate that space.
      </p>
<p>
	It is not, however, the case that Kafka, Musil, and Rilke learned the lessons of modern acoustical research and incorporated them into their writing in the hopes of achieving a new kind of scientific realism.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> To claim this would be to give them too little and too much credit at once. It would be to underestimate their radical attempts to reinterpret human sensation through aesthetic means, and to overestimate their scientific knowledge. <a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Still, their techniques of representation align so neatly with scientific notions of the spatial constitution of auditory experience, that some explanation of this parallel discovery in science and art is required. How is it that modern physics and modernist literature both arrived at the conclusion that when we hear, we hear space?<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Musil, Rilke, and Kafka lived in a world that had been fundamentally transformed by acoustical science and the technological innovations it enabled. This is not only a biographical fact, but one that is reflected in their writings. Rilke wrote about the gramophone in “Primal Sound” , Kafka about the telephone in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Castle</span> , and Musil about stereo-acoustic hearing in “The Blackbird”  and his wartime diaries from 1915, to name just a few examples. They all went to the theater, saw movies, and heard concerts; they attended and performed readings of literary works; they listened to live voices on the radio and recorded ones on phonographs. Their lives and works were deeply informed by the technology, architecture, and physiology of hearing in the modern world. It is not hard to believe that their literary works also reflect the intimate relationship between sound and space.
      </p>
<p>
	This essay aims to specify this link through close analysis of particular works, in order to demonstrate how these writers engaged the question of acoustic experience in modernity—and, in particular, in the spaces of modernity. Moreover, it seeks to uncover a logic of sensory experience, derived from the relationship of sound and space, that informs a significant strand of modernist writing. Kafka, Rilke, and Musil collectively develop a theory of literary production based on sensory imbalance: the condition of possibility of writing is a deficit or excess of perceptual stimuli, often in the auditory realm. Inadequate and unsuccessful acts of hearing, the consequence of listening in enclosed spaces, generate problems for ral representation and narrative development. The thin walls, flimsy doors, and porous concrete buildings of modernity and modernism transmit either a jarring acoustic mélange or an isolated indecipherable tone. Consequently, these authors are constantly being forced to write against such  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> noises: to explain, rationalize, silence, or aestheticize them. This difficult task, even when it fails—and it usually does—determines the activity of modernist narrative. Whether meaning is overwhelmed by an overload of sound or thwarted by a lack of auditory information, the difficulties that ensue in its absence become a touchstone of literary modernism. Musil, Rilke, and Kafka do not resolve the problem of noise, but find ways to represent it through a spatialized discourse of sound.
      </p>
<p>
	This essay is part of a growing trend to revaluate noise: rather than view it as a disruption, a distraction, and a disturbance, scholars from a variety of disciplines have come to see noise as a highly productive, if not entirely positive, force. This trend began in the late 1970s with such works as Jacques Attali’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Noise</span>  and Michel Serres’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Parasite</span> .<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Challenging the conventional opposition of music and noise, Attali argued that music is nothing more than the organization of noise; both acoustic phenomena should be considered as markers and predictors of social and political life. To ignore or suppress noise is to be blind—or deaf—to the economy of power it both reflects and governs. In a related move, Serres sought to overturn the signal-noise dichotomy upon which theories of communication are generally based. The signal, he argues, fundamentally relies on noise, a parasite that enables communication precisely by threatening it. The goal of communication cannot be the elimination of noise, since this would require dissolving the medium or channel through which messages are sent and with it the very act of communication. In a work that imaginatively explores numerous institutions and disciplines (including myth, literature, thermodynamics and economics), Serres argues for the fundamental reliance of systems on parasites.

	In the wake of these works, there have been numerous theories of listening (Szendy 2000, Nancy 2002) and histories of the ear (Sterne 2002, Smith, ed. 2004), countless studies of the voice (Göttert 1998, Meyer-Kalkus 2001, Kittler, Macho and Weigel, eds. 2002, Dolar 2006), and a few examinations of noise.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Douglas Kahn’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Noise Water Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts</span>  is a notable example, since he treats noise as a major cultural force in the twentieth century.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The phenomenon of noise in literature has received less sustained attention, except by Philipp Schweighauser in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Noises of American Literature, 1890–1985: Toward a History of Literary Acoustics</span>, for whom literary noise reflects and embodies certain social, political, and aesthetic realities, much as “actual” noise did for Attali.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Recent collections on sound and German culture (Alter and Koepnick, eds. 2004, Silberman, ed. 2006) tend to favor more familiar and less recalcitrant sound objects, such as music and the voice, though certain contributors do tackle the problem of meaningless sound.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This essay hopes to help soften the resistance to literary noise by paying sustained attention, for the first time, to a specific aspect of it: the relationship of sound and space.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Robert Musil and the Unfiltering of Modern Acoustic Experience</h1>
<p>
	  Robert Musil’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Posthumous Papers of a Living Author</span>  is a heterogeneous work of cultural commentary, philosophical reflection, and fictional exploration. It is divided into four parts: “Pictures,” “Ill-Tempered Observations,” “Unstorylike Stories,”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and a short fictional work called “The Blackbird.” The second part contains a piece entitled “Doors and Portals,” an exposition on the contemporary status and function of these liminal architectural structures.
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    A door consists of a rectangular wooden frame set in the wall, on which a moveable board is fastened. This board at least is still barely comprehensible. For it is supposed to be light enough to be easily pivoted, and it fits in with the oak and walnut paneling that until recently adorned every proper living room. Yet even this board has already lost most of its significance. Up until the middle of the last century you could listen in with your ear pressed against it, and what secrets you could sometimes hear! The count had disowned his stepdaughter, and the hero, who was supposed to marry her, heard just in time that they planned to poison him. Let anybody try such a feat in a contemporary house! Before he even got to listen in at the door, he’d have long heard everything through the walls. And what’s more: not even the faintest thought would have escaped his ear. Why has no radiopoet [Rundfunkdichter] yet taken advantage of the possibilities of the modern concrete structure [Betonbau]?! It is undoubtedly the predestined stage for the radio play!<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Ostensibly “Doors and Portals” documents the waning cultural significance of the two architectural features its title names. The quoted passage reveals the loss that ensues in the realm of literature: eavesdropping at someone’s door no longer serves as a useful and powerful narrative device for novels, particularly those with romantic and sentimental themes; doors have therefore lost their power to produce and organize literary knowledge. Another section of the text recapitulates a long list of proverbial and colloquial references to doors and doorways in order to highlight their current obsolescence. All this might seem rather odd, unless one assumes that Musil is not genuinely lamenting the decline of these structures, but ironizing the nostalgia of a conservative cultural criticism that rues the onset of any and all change.
	</p>
<p>
	  And yet, as is often the case in Musil’s writings, the tone is inconsistent and therefore difficult to discern. A layer of light sarcasm notwithstanding, architecture serves as a metaphor for consciousness and physical sensation: doors and doorways are res for the points at which thoughts and perceptions enter and exit the human mind and body. To claim they are obsolete is to say that there is no longer a clear boundary between inner life and external circumstances, that stimuli flow freely through individuals without filters and constraints, and that modern man cannot impose order on his perceptions and experiences. Indeed, he cannot even know what it means to <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> perceptions and experiences. Musil’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Betonbau</span>, with its porous walls, floors, and ceilings representing acoustic transparency, is a metaphor for the overloaded and disorderly state of human consciousness—even its dissolution—in modernity.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Whether Musil wants to explore aspects of the modern psyche and soma, perform a cultural critique of architecture, or simply mock those who bother to criticize such things as architecture, “Doors and Portals” clearly seeks to represent a real human condition—social, psychological, aesthetic, and perceptual—through architectural discourse. What is less obvious is that this representation, whatever its intended or unintended effects, draws heavily on acoustics: the architectural structures Musil invokes, the door and the concrete building, are defined by the sounds they do and do  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> not transmit. Hearing, not vision or touch, is the sense through which the inner spaces of architecture are accessed.
	</p>
<p>
	  Musil’s piece argues that architectural evolution has brought about a transformation in auditory sensation. The door, back when it had a proper function, leaked significant information, as well as misinformation, to curious and well-situated individuals. It filtered sounds and thereby shaped hearing: by blocking most sounds, the ones that did pass through it took on heightened importance. These acoustic nuggets, one gathers from Musil’s (feigned) excitement, were responsible for the dramatic twists and sentimental storylines of a certain literary genre, the romantic or sentimental novel. In such works, doors enabled the communication of precious secrets, covert plans, and potentially explosive information to unintended listeners. Musil’s own fanciful concoction, compressed into a single humorous sentence, involves romantic intrigue, inheritance, and murder! Eavesdropping was thus a literary cipher for meaningful listening: to put a character’s ear to a door was to signal that an important message would be transmitted. In the golden age of doors, Musil suggests, authors could not only produce a sense of secrecy and mystery through closed doors and acts of sly eavesdropping, they could posit the existence and communicability of discrete and comprehensible messages.
	</p>
<p>
	  The depiction of the servants Rachel and Soliman in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Man Without Qualities</span> also reveals Musil’s ironic interest in the trope of the eavesdropper. In one passage these characters peep through a keyhole and listen in through a door on a meeting of the “Parallel Action,” the nebulous planning project for the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the Austro-Hungarian emperor’s coronation. In the process, they are both overcome by an exaggerated sense of thrill at their stealthy adventure. Rachel and Soliman are quixotic res who have imbibed countless sentimental novels, which they now mimic in their spying and gossiping. However the exhilaration they feel derives not from the actual event they are earwitnessing (the meetings of the “Parallel Action” are incontrovertibly dull and uneventful) but from their enactment of a familiar literary trope—only in Musil’s novel no useful information is gleaned. Though its form can still be mimicked, eavesdropping no longer guarantees a meaningful message; its literary cachet has run dry.
	</p>
<p>
	  If architectural structures once channeled sound and thereby enabled acts of meaningful listening, so the argument runs in “Doors and Portals,” presently they allow the free flow of acoustic material: the “faintest thought” is transmitted from one room to the next. The result of this constant, unfiltered torrent of sounds is noise. Musil is criticizing the flimsiness of modern architecture, but he is also suggesting that the thin walls and cheap materials of modern buildings represent the porousness of the modern mind and the exposed nature of personal thoughts. Architectural acoustics offers an apt metaphor for a consciousness that can no longer be contained, an inner world accessible—“audible”—to anyone.
	</p>
<p>
	  The surprising twist in Musil’s architectural history is that modern buildings not only transform auditory experience, but also dispense with long-standing novelistic conventions and transform literary genres. As in the earlier model of acoustic transmission, in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> which doors enabled meaningful acts of listening in prescribed literary contexts, the acoustic paradigm opened up by the concrete building corresponds to a kind of literature: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hörspiel</span>, or radio play, in which the acoustic dimension of literary expression received newfound consideration. This genre was conceived in the early 1920s as a marriage between the acoustic and the literary, but its most experimental manifestation, examples of which could be heard in the period that Musil wrote “Doors and Portals,” abandoned a script in favor of an acoustic montage produced by juxtaposing and sequencing disparate sounds and voices.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> For example, Walter Ruttmann’s 1930 piece, <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend</span>, is a sound collage of various activities and events (from car horns and slamming doors to a child’s voice reciting poetry) drawn from a Berlin weekend. Musil’s idea of basing a radio play on the sounds generated within and around a city apartment building would have been the perfect complement to <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend</span>. His acoustical work was structured by a temporal principle (different sounds taken from a given time), while Musil’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Betonbau</span>—if we may give this hypothetical work a title—proposed to experiment with a locational constraint (different sounds taken from a given place). Though Musil’s imagined radio play was never realized, he hardly abandoned the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hörspiel</span> as a speculative notion.
	</p>
<p>
	  Musil is interested less in the practical possibilities of the radio play than in the relationship to sound it seems to capture, which reflects a contemporary attitude toward listening. Filtered sounds produce not only coherent messages but a belief in the communicability of ideas. Noise however produces confusion, alienation, distance, and self-doubt. If the radio play can capture and reproduce inchoate sounds, it can serve as a cipher for a number of modern woes. When modern man listens, he can no longer assume that he will discover comprehensible messages; the necessary link between audibility and meaning is gone. The radio play reflects this new acoustic uncertainty.
	</p>
<p>
	  The final section of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Posthumous Papers</span>, “The Blackbird,” is a story that explores, in writing, some possibilities offered up by the radio play: it conveys an array of promising sounds in a decidedly indeterminate fashion.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In this fictional narrative, the character Azwei (A-two) relates three episodes from his past to his friend Aeins (A-one), each of which centers on a cryptic but deeply moving acoustic experience. The first episode begins with a description of a Berlin “Hof,” the small courtyard that forms where the backs of several buildings meet. The narrator explains not only how various voices and the sounds of domestic activity move through this enclosure, but also describes the crowded arrangement of rooms, walls, and furniture in these buildings—an order determined by a deficit of space. “The Blackbird” thus depicts a modern <span style="font-style:italic;">Betonbau</span>, and the assortment of sounds it emits and transmits, as the site at which acoustic drama unfolds. It is the realization, in written form, of Musil’s proposed radio play.
	</p>
<p>
	  When Aeins asks Azwei to unfold the collective meaning of the three stories he has told him, the listener reveals a false assumption about the necessary interpretability of sound in narrative: “aren’t you implying [ . . . ] that all this is supposed to have a common thread [einen Sinn gemeinsam]?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 145). Implicit in the act of storytelling, Aeins seems to be saying, is the possibility of discovering a coherent meaning. The storyteller’s response debunks his friend’s supposition without offering a new interpretive scheme in its place:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    “no — [ . . . ] this is just the way it happened; and if I knew the point of it all, then I wouldn’t have had to tell it in the first place. But it’s like hearing a whisper [flüstern] and a rustling [rauschen] outside, without being able to distinguish between the two!”
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 145).
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    This remark can be read as a programmatic statement on the undecidability of sound in narratives. If in former times sounds foregrounded in written fiction necessarily signified (the eavesdropping-at-the-door model), Azwei declares this convention misguided and obsolete (the <span style="font-style:italic;">Betonbau</span> model). We can assume neither that the noise of modern experience can be decoded and rationalized, nor that it defies order and comprehension. The status of sense experience in modernity is thoroughly destabilized: narrative form no longer implies the existence of coherent and discernible meanings, nor does it deny this possibility. The modern condition, and hence the condition that writing must somehow accommodate, is that we are unable to determine whether what we hear is <span style="font-style:italic;">Rauschen</span>, senseless noise, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Flüstern</span>, secrets that encode meaning. It is not that former times made sense and that the modern age makes nonsense, but rather that we no longer know what listening will yield.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In representing personal memory as an accumulation of seemingly disparate auditory perceptions that resist interpretation, “The Blackbird” hints at the same problem that “Doors and Portals” addresses: narrative fiction may no longer be capable of reckoning with contemporary modes of hearing, since the only tendency it knows is rationalization and explanation; it lacks the means to deal with sounds that are not messages—that is, with noise. Both texts suggest that a flight from traditional written forms might be the only way to attune literary sensibility to the changed ways in which modern man hears the world, changes which themselves derive from modifications in architecture and the conration of space. Thus they refer, directly or indirectly, to the radio play. This new form, above all a new way of <span style="font-style:italic;">experiencing</span> literature, promises to reflect the new spatialization of sound in modernity.
	  </p>
<p>
	    It seems, then, that Musil was perhaps more intrigued by the idea of the radio play than by its execution. This is why his works propose not so much to abandon writing in favor of new artistic forms as to transform written texts on the basis of contemporary aesthetic innovations. The result would be a kind of writing that accommodates the indeterminacy of noise: it does not insist on extracting a message from its component sounds, nor does it dismiss them as senseless garbage. Such writing might replace the sequential uncovering of meaning in linear narratives with acoustic montage in written form. The effect and interest of this mode of representing sound lies in how it resists being resolved into meaningful elements. Ideally, literary acoustic montage would suspend the analytical process in the hopes of activating and expanding the reader’s sensory world, forcing him to confront its <span style="font-style:italic;">Rauschen</span>. Auditory inundation would also reveal the new indeterminacy of information in modern writing—the fact that sound no longer promises signification and that hearing no longer guarantees understanding. Musil’s reflections on the changing relationship between sound and space thus signal the dawn of a new aesthetic of uncertainty.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rainer Maria Rilke: The Mental Space of Hearing</h1>
<p>
	    If Musil was suggesting that the noise and confusion of modern life could find their expression in the radio play or a commensurate form of writing, the opening pages of Rilke’s 1910 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</span>, proleptically fulfill Musil’s proposal. Rilke’s montage of noises could be given the title “<span style="font-style:italic;">Betonbau</span>”:

Somewhere a pane of glass shatters, I hear the big fragments laugh, the small splinters titter. Then, suddenly, a muffled, confined noise from the other side, within the building. Someone is climbing the stairs. Coming, incessantly coming. Is here, is here a long time, passes by. And the street again. A girl screams: <span style="font-style:italic;">Ah tais-toi, je ne veux plus</span>. The trolley comes running up all excited, runs on over it, over everything. Someone calls out.

<p class="continued">
	    This passage constitutes the novel’s second section. In its first, Malte roams the streets of Paris, experiencing the city through his sense of sight, smell, taste, and touch. What is noticeably absent from this array of sensations is any acoustic impression. “I have been out,” Malte reports, and he has encountered stimuli for all but one of the five senses: not a single sound, it would seem, has been produced or heard (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1). Only when he goes inside does he begin to register and record auditory impressions. Indeed, once he is confined to an indoor space sounds seem to dominate Malte’s sensory field and crowd out all other perceptions.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> This division of sensation suggests a link between hearing and spaces of enclosure.
	  </p>
<p>
	    When he is outside, Malte’s perceptual experience is coordinated: it offers a coherent, multi-sensory image of a city suspended between life and death, one that invokes feelings of sickness, anxiety, and disgust. Once he is indoors and the only input he receives is aural, the wholeness of the image disintegrates. If visual space is legible and rational—Malte is, after all, “learning to see,” and succeeding at it—acoustic space is decidedly unruly. Perhaps the sounds of modernity resist ordering, or maybe Malte’s difficulties stem from the isolation of hearing. As he lies in bed awaiting sleep, he hears everything and nothing: the sounds of automobiles and streetcars, footsteps, slamming doors and rattling windows, human voices and animal cries. These sounds are discrete and identifiable, but they cannot be combined into a meaningful whole, or even described in complete sentences. What unites them is that they are all heard at a particular location, Malte’s room in a shabby Parisian hostel, a physical edifice that filters sound. The building has become, as Musil would put it, “the predestined stage for the radio play”: it transmits the sounds in its vicinity unselectively, resulting in an acoustic experience that is varied and lively, but also jarring and chaotic. Architecture provides a site for auditory experience, but it cannot guarantee its meaning or utility. Indeed, because acts of hearing within enclosures constrain the other sensory faculties (Malte hears everything, but at the expense of seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> anything), acoustic experience seems to prevent a complete and unified perceptual experience.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The spatialization of sound in Rilke’s rendition of modernity is decidedly isolating and confusing.
	  </p>
<p>
	    If the dreary and melancholy images of the novel’s first section represent an essentially Romantic expression of modern reality, the montage presented in the novel’s second section reflects a new aesthetic of uncertainty. Malte’s collage of sounds awakens the impulse and desire to interpret, which cannot be satisfied. One can begin to order the sounds Malte invokes, or at least identify dichotomies into which they fall (mechanical/natural, human/animal, intentional/accidental, alienating/comforting), but this only produces stale categories that do not reflect the overall impact of the acoustic description. Nor is it satisfying to ignore the specific make-up of the din and conclude that Malte’s experience reflects the overwhelming of the modern subject through excessive stimulation; Rilke is too careful a writer for such facile conclusions. Malte’s sensations leave the reader with the same interpretive problem that Musil hints at in “Doors and Portals,” namely that there are ways to present acoustic experiences consistent with the realities of modern life, but it is unclear what their place in literature should be. Should they be taken as indecipherable <span style="font-style:italic;">Rauschen</span> or as sounds that contain hidden meanings waiting to be discovered? For example, the dog’s bark and the cock’s crow bring Malte a sense of calm and relief. Unlike the noises that precede them, which derive from humans and machines rushing about in crowded urban spaces, these sounds belong to the countryside. Perhaps they appeal to Malte because they remind him of the slower pace of rural life. The cock’s crow, which announces the onset of morning, signifies a calm and predictable temporal order, as opposed to the hurried pace of city life. The representation of different noises thus allows Malte to contrast various modes of temporal experience in modernity. While this interpretation is plausible, it is based on the assumption that Malte’s catalogue of sounds is a portrait rather than a scribble, that it contains signals rather than noise, and that these acoustic orders can even be distinguished. Rilke’s acoustic montage urges us to question such assumptions, at the same time that it prevents us from rejecting them entirely. The passage suspends interpretation, revealing the unsettling effects of spatialized sound in modernist writing.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Like Musil, Rilke suggests a program for modernist literature based on the un-knowability of whether sounds signify or are senseless noise. In fact, Rilke’s proposed aesthetic of uncertainty is more radical and explicit than Musil’s: he shows, in the second half of <span style="font-style:italic;">Malte Laurids Brigge</span>, that the very condition of possibility of modernist writing is sensory incompleteness. Through an extended allegory of poetic creation, Rilke specifies the theory of modernist unknowing we have been sketching. According to him, it is not only that we cannot know exactly when and how to apply our interpretive energies because we do not know what we are hearing; more fundamentally, we cannot <span style="font-style:italic;">write</span> unless we lack this knowledge. Rilke advances a negative epistemology as the basis of a modernist poetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The central episode of architecturally mediated listening in Rilke’s novel revolves around the sound of a tin can lid falling to the floor in a neighboring apartment. This  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> banal event serves as the basis for a lengthy reflection on the nature of perception, imagination, poetic production and ethical life.

	      Almost everyone knows the noise that some kind of tinny, round thing, let’s say the lid of a tin box, causes when it slips out of your hands. Usually it doesn’t make much of a noise when it lands: it hits, rolls on its edge, and really only becomes unpleasant when the wobbling runs down and it tumbles noisily in all directions before coming to rest. So then: that’s the whole story; some such tinny object fell next door, rolled, and lay still, after, at certain intervals, thumping. Like all noises that are produced repetitively, this one too had organized itself inwardly; it transformed itself, it was never exactly the same. But precisely that spoke for its regularity.

	      Here Malte is anything but overwhelmed and confused by the sound he hears through the walls of his room. The sentences are not short and jumpy as they were at the outset of the novel, but elegant and precise; they betray calmness and control. Indeed, Malte is so clearheaded about his auditory experience that he not only identifies the sounds and their sources, but also justifies his conclusions through a subtle argument about the law of repetition. As it happens, this is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> “the whole story.” It is in fact only the very beginning of a sophisticated treatise on the tin can, one that will, over the course of several pages, proffer a series of narrative and theoretical claims about the relation of humans and objects in modernity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      At first glance, this acoustic experience seems utterly unlike the one with which the novel opened. Both episodes depict sounds heard through walls and closed doors and independently of the other four senses, but one is overwhelming and chaotic, while the other is minimal and a source of great intellectual and aesthetic productivity. They both, however, contain ideas about literary production in the midst of modern noise. Rilke demonstrates that noise can arise from two seemingly opposite situations: excessive or deficient sound. In the first case, the disparate clash calls for new forms of representation which may or not reveal acoustic meaning. In the second case, the bareness of a single isolated sound activates the mental powers of the perceiving subject. The tin can episode serves as an example of fanciful speculation motivated by meaningless sound, and it offers an implicit theory of the relation between perceptual constraint and imaginative activity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Malte’s empirical knowledge of the tin can is limited to what he hears through the wall. Even the fact that it is a tin can is not so much known as inferred: the perception of a certain sound allows him to assume the presence of the object commonly associated with that particular sound. We regularly extrapolate in this way when first-hand experience is limited, but Malte goes several steps further. He describes, in intimate detail, what the tin can looks like, its exact location in his neighbor’s apartment, as well as the series of events that causes it to tumble to the floor at irregular intervals. The precision and length of his account cannot easily be reconciled with the bareness of the auditory experience. In a sense, Malte is a typical neo-Romantic, overstepping the bounds of verifiable knowledge in order to expand the realms of thought and experience. <a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Romantics sought to liberate the imagination from its Kantian strictures,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> wherein its central function is to order perceptions. For them, imagination was a creative power, the privilege of the artist who was free and daring enough to explore and represent mental activity beyond the confines of reason and understanding.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Malte’s musings are an example of this freedom of the mind to explore possible but unverifiable realities.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      As the passage progresses, Malte’s reflections grow increasingly distant from their point of origin—the tinny clang emanating from his neighbor’s room. He goes on to imagine other objects that might have stood on the mantle next to the supposed tin can (a mirror and a monkey) and to ponder, on the basis of a complex and counterintuitive analogy with damaged objects, the degraded condition of mankind in modernity. The claim, in brief, is that humans are fundamentally dissatisfied with their lives, which leads them to act carelessly and hastily; objects witness this behavior and imitate it, resulting in a world of bent and broken things. The “fall” of the tin can lid is thus literal and rative, and a direct consequence of the bad example set by human beings. Even before he begins to elaborate this strange comparison, however, Malte’s reflections have already accrued a theoretical status on the basis of the imagined objects he conjures. The mirror, in its capacity for reflection, and the ape, as a proverbial imitator, are pointed—even clichéd—references to a Romantic model of aesthetic production. Prior to developing an abstract theory of human-object relations (with clear biblical and ethical overtones), the imagery of Malte’s account has already revealed his aspirations in the realm of aesthetic theory.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While it is probably going too far to say that Malte advances a full-blown account of literary creation, his notes on the tin can posit a necessary link between perceptual constraint and imaginative activity. This point is demonstrated by the stream of thoughts triggered by a minimal noise, and it is implied by the confident tone in which the entire episode is narrated. Throughout these pages, Malte speaks with uncharacteristic self-assurance, despite the fact that almost everything he says is actually unverified hypothesis.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> This tone is especially surprising given what we know about Malte’s general mood of anxiety and self-doubt. It should be taken as an indication that Malte is thoroughly at home in the realm of imagination—more at home, in fact, than he is in the realm of empirical sensation. His exposition on the tin can is not meant to compete with reality. Rather, it exists in another realm, one that opens up precisely at the limit of sense experience. Malte thereby suggests that there is a kind of knowledge borne of the imagination whose very condition is perceptual lack. The images and narratives he conjures compensate for the limits of sense experience: they produce a substitute for a reality that cannot be known. The generation of this ersatz, if we read his exposition as a kind of aesthetic theory, is the work of poetic creation. The results of Malte’s imaginative processes are evidence of what speculative thought achieves under conditions of architecturally constrained hearing: literature.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Numerous critics have examined the implicit theories of aesthetic experience and reception in <span style="font-style:italic;">Malte Laurids Brigge</span>, but their grounding in a deficit of sensory input has not been addressed. Spatial constraints not only reveal the limits of the human sensorium, but also enable a kind of hearing in the mind. The sounds heard, or conjured, in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this mental space are not subject to the laws of physics, physiology, and architecture, but they are enabled by the constraints these laws impose upon the perceiving subject. The mental space of hearing is conditioned not by walls, floors and building materials, but by a need for knowledge that outstrips perceptual capacities. Rilke’s model of literary creation thus operates according to a compensatory epistemology: it produces a kind of knowledge (in the form of imagined sensations, images, stories, and theories) through speculative acts enabled and inspired by a paucity of direct sensory experience.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Franz Kafka and Architectural Narration</h1>
<p>
	      The works of Franz Kafka are so full of buildings, houses, and castles, as well as various architectural features associated with them (walls, staircases, towers, gates, and rooms of all sorts, including classrooms, bedrooms, and courtrooms), it seems justified to speak of architectural narration as a mode of expression in his writing. Of course, these edifices are often absent, as in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Castle</span>, or provisional: “The Great Wall of China” names a structure that is under construction and unfinishable, and in “The Burrow” we find a sort of negative edifice, an intricate underground cavern that is deconstructed over the course of an unfinishable narrative. The fact that buildings are so central to Kafka’s literary imagination, coupled with the fact that they are never really there, or really done, or really what they seem to be, helps explain the confusion and desperation that characterize so much of his fiction. His characters survey and they build, often with zeal, but rarely if ever are they able to grasp or complete an architectural project. This circumstance produces a mode of discourse that I have termed architectural narration.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Kafka’s unfinished story “The Burrow” elaborates the acoustic conditions of architectural narration: in order to tell the story of the burrow, the narrator must describe a process of auditory exploration. The narrative fragment consists of the agitated reflections of an unnamed creature (we will call him the burrower) who has built himself a safe underground home which he hopes to inhabit in peaceful isolation. It chronicles his labor, both its successes and its shortcomings, and culminates in the completion of the burrow. This event would seem to require that the story come to an end, given that the burrower’s existence is guided by a single aim: the construction of a secure enclosure. And yet Kafka and his burrower persist. As if to save “The Burrow” from closure, Kafka introduces a nagging hissing sound into it. This disturbance, a noise that simultaneously threatens and sustains the burrow, guarantees the (tortured) continuation of narrative.
	    </p>
<p>
	      “The Burrow” addresses a general question about narrative fiction: is it possible to write a story about a house or a home? Epics tend to be about coming home or leaving home—for example the <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span>. Simply being at home is too static a condition for narrative; it lacks movement and direction, some form of which is required for narrative progression. It is easy enough to think of novels that thematize and problematize domestic existence (<span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>) and ones that use the setting of the home to explore memory and childhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">In Search of Lost</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span>), but these works do not rely solely on the physical space of habitation for their narrative motivation.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> In them, the house or the home provides a site for an activity, or it triggers memories or feelings out of which a narrative develops. In Kafka’s story, however, the burrow is not a mere setting or pretext for reflection; it is not a point from which to explore the past, the future or another place. “The Burrow” is, quite plainly, about the here and the now. One can argue that the space it describes is symbolical, <a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> but even so its physical contours are its most prominent feature. “The Burrow” is about dwelling in a particular architectural enclosure, and as such it is a story with nowhere to go. Its first sentence—“I have established my burrow, and it seems to be a success”—announces an end point; indeed, it sounds more like a closing remark than an opening line.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Kafka’s story has reached a conclusion at the moment of its inception. The narrative is stuck.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The typically Kafkan paradox at work here is that the very thing that threatens the physical structure (the burrow) enables the progression of the story (“The Burrow”). This thing is the “hardly audible hissing” that seems to confirm the burrower’s fears about invasion and validate his expositions on the principles for safe existence (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 177). The noise simultaneously justifies and nurtures his anxieties, giving him an enemy against which to struggle. Kafka’s burrower finds or produces this object of threat and potential destruction, and thereby furnishes the story with a conflict that enables narrative progression. The noise in the burrow thus offers purpose and direction to the narrative. If the desire for safety in solitude leads the burrower to build his home, the noise guides his paranoid destruction of it.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The disturbance, however, never materializes. Or, to be more precise, it never develops a material existence beyond its acoustic effect; it remains no more and no less than a disembodied sound. The noise is named and renamed according to the acoustic impression it makes at any given moment (hissing, scratching, whistling, etc.) and it is interpreted and reinterpreted in accordance with the burrower’s paranoid whims: the enemy is single or multiple, capricious or scheming, vicious or simply careless, and so on. This indeterminacy is what makes the sound menacing, and thus an effective narrative device. It suggests that the enemy is neither a creature nor a sound, but a lack of definite knowledge.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In addition to being unidentifiable, the noise is ineradicable. In fact, if there is one thing the burrower knows, it is that there is no escaping the noise in his home. Brief moments of silence are overshadowed by fearful anticipation that the noise will return, or even worse, that the enemy will appear soundlessly. Though the burrower wants nothing more than peace and quiet, the story cannot afford to silence the noise in his home—to explain what it is, what has caused it, and why it is there. To do so would be to eliminate the informational gap upon which Kafka’s narrative thrives. It would be to bring closure to a story that Kafka not only left unfinished, but which is in its essence unfinishable.
	    </p>
<p>
	      How exactly does the noise in the burrow nourish and sustain “The Burrow”? The noise leads the burrower around his home: he roams, he pokes about, he bumps up against its walls, he begins to take it apart . . . Listening serves as a guide for architectural  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> exploration and, as it were, deconstruction. The noise in the burrow thus determines the course of the burrower’s physical movement and the direction of the narrative. When he hears something he cannot identify, he is forced to consider the fact of an outside world, a realm beyond the enclosure in which he dwells that is accessible only through its sounds. As a result, hearing becomes the basis for the burrower’s partial, speculative, and contingent knowledge about external reality. Unlike Malte, he does not confidently embrace the power to imaginatively embellish his limited auditory perceptions. Rather, his fragmentary and deficient knowledge is a source of considerable anxiety, but also a wellspring of narrative activity. In both situations, architecturally constrained hearing enables narrative activity and suggests a theory of literary production, but in Rilke’s work this reflects the potential of unbridled imaginative thought and in Kafka’s story it is the terrifying result of a futile attempt at solitary existence.
	    </p>
<p>
	      One might think that Kafka’s architectural narration governs only those works in which the existence, construction, or destruction of a physical edifice is at issue, but in fact the most compelling instance of it can be found in “Josefine, the Singer or The Mouse People,” a story that not only lacks buildings and enclosures, but seems to take place in a spatial vacuum. The story centers on a remarkable but uncharacterizable sound, Josefine’s song, and the audience of mice who listens to it. This auditory activity occurs in a place that is neither inside nor outside, a space utterly devoid of architectural markers. Is it possible to hear in the absence of space? The lesson of “The Burrow” is that spatial structures condition acts of hearing, which in turn motivate narration. The second part of this description applies quite well to “Josefine,” a story that derives much of its narrative impulse from failed attempts to unlock the mystery of Josefine’s song. And yet the story has no buildings, houses, caves, walls, or gates, not even a stage or a podium for Josefine to stand on. There is only the undifferentiated and seemingly bare space in which the mouse folk scurries about and performs an unspecified variety of work.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While there are no fixed structures and locations in “Josefine,” the story offers moments of fleeting, organic spatial organization. Josefine strikes a pose and suddenly all the mice stand frozen before her: they are not buildings, but res that temporarily conre the space of narrative. Indeed, Josefine’s special gift seems to lie not in her voice (in the end, no distinctive acoustic quality or effect can be discerned) but in her ability to generate an architecture of the body:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		to gather around her this crowd of our people, who are almost continually in motion, shooting off here and there for purposes that are often not very clear, Josefine generally needs to do no more than assume that stance—her little head tilted back, mouth half-open, eyes turned toward the heights—that indicates that she intends to sing.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 98)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Josefine’s gift is to unify the mice into a “Volk der Mäuse,” or mouse people. It might seem that she accomplishes this through her voice, but in fact she achieves it through her body. Singing is an afterthought. By the time she opens her mouth, Josefine has already captured the attention of the mice and gathered them into a unified group. The mice, who spend their days running about in all directions, have been stunned  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> into stillness by this piece of murine architecture. Josefine’s corporeal steadiness halts their formless activity: it literally gives shape to the community. Her calm and motionless stance imposes order and direction on the disorderly mass. All of the mice look toward her and, like so many works of architecture, she channels their gazes upwards. A pillar, a simple column pointing to the sky, Josefine literally embodies the basic principle of all building.
	      </p>
<p>
		Numerous critics have struggled to reconcile two central ideas in “Josefine”: the fact that she exerts a unifying force over the mice, and the fact that her singing is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> special. Though the story begins by distinguishing her as a singer, her status as a musician slowly unravels over the course of a narrative that cannot sustain any claims about the distinctiveness of her vocal activity. But wherein lies her power if not in her song? The answer proposed here is that her ability to unify the mouse folk derives from her physical position, her self-transformation into a piece of architecture.
	      </p>
<p>
		This is not to say that acts of listening in the story are insignificant. As the narrator tells us, Josefine’s song must be grasped with the ear <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the eye: “to understand her art, you must not only hear but also see her” (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 96). The vision of Josefine produces architectural space, which is the condition of hearing. Before Josefine arrives on the scene there is a spatial vacuum that prevents perception altogether: there is mindless hustle and bustle, but no unity, no structure, and no perceptual activity. The laws of science teach that there can be neither vision nor hearing in the absence of space, since these activities rely on the movement of material (sound or light waves) through a medium. Josefine’s physical presence cancels this spatial void and thereby enables the mice to see and to hear. She emerges on the scene as spatiality itself—the condition of possibility of perception, the very medium of sensory experience.
	      </p>
<p>
		If Josefine the mouse-singer is distinguished not by her song but her stance, what distinguishes “Josefine” the story is the purity with which it employs architectural narration as a discursive mode. It is not merely the case that buildings and structures help maintain narrative suspense; here architecture is responsible for the very existence of the narrator. Before Josefine, no mouse is distinguished from the masses. But when Josefine strikes her pose, she not only makes a name for herself—she is literally the only named mouse in the story—she introduces the idea of individuation into the community. The immediate consequence of this is the emergence of the narrator-mouse, who uses the apparently irresolvable mystery of Josefine’s song to showcase his own talents as a storyteller. This is why he brings Josefine to our attention only to systematically discredit her: his carefully orchestrated struggle to account for Josefine’s song is in fact a carefully orchestrated display of his own virtuosic narrative abilities. Though he remains unnamed, he is the strongest evidence that architecture conditions not only perceptual experience but narration itself.
	      </p>
<p>
		“Josefine” is a limit case for a kind of modernist fiction that res the emergence of narrative from an incomplete, overwhelming, or otherwise indecipherable auditory experience, itself conditioned by architectural structures. These works seem to struggle against auditory constraints at the same time that they are shaped by them. The reliance of this form of writing on architecture is most pointed in the instance where that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> structure is most minimal: the simulated, contingent and tenuous quality of Josefine, the living pillar. There is no inner space to give form to auditory activity in “Josefine,” but hearing and narration are still functions of a physical structure that organizes and enables mouse activity. Indeed, the minimal difference that seems to mark, at times, Josefine’s vocal activity as singing (“Singen”) as opposed to mere whistling (“Pfeifen”), consists not in an acoustic quality but in a spatial one. When audible differences must be explained in spatial terms, the transformation of sound into space is complete.
	      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Spatial Turn, Acoustic Turn</h1>
<p>
		Something is amiss about the quantity of acoustic material in modernist German literature: either the ear is overwhelmed, as in the opening pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Malte Laurids Brigge</span> and the description of the concrete building in Musil’s “Doors and Portals,” or the ear receives too little sensory information, as in Malte’s acoustic encounter with the tin can lid and the noise in Kafka’s burrow. In both cases the listener is stimulated by noise, but lacks the perceptual information needed to bring order and meaning to the experience. Encounters with noise are usually confusing and irritating, but they are also motivating: they produce a drive to describe and explain, to speculate and imagine, and above all to narrate. I have suggested three ways in which noise enables narrative: in Musil noise raises the question of interpretation and posits the undecidability of meaning in modernist writing; in Rilke it triggers imaginative thought and thereby opens up a realm of experience and knowledge that is otherwise inaccessible; and in Kafka the haunting menace of noise and the curious indeterminacy of voice pose problems for inquisitive narrators to investigate.
	      </p>
<p>
		Noise, then, is a central feature of modernist writing, or at least of the works of these three authors. It is deeply implicated in their reflections on the nature of literary creation in general, and modernist narrative fiction in particular. Furthermore, we have seen that any exploration of sound is also an exploration of space. Musil, Rilke, and Kafka depict acoustic phenomena and auditory activities by describing the architectural structures in and around which they take place. These buildings and burrows constrain hearing and prevent understanding at the same time that they enable a discourse of sound. The most revealing example of this is Kafka’s “Josefine,” in which sound becomes a function of space: it presents a musicality that is so elusive and undefinable because it consists not in melodies or harmonies but in a certain conration of architectural space.
	      </p>
<p>
		Kafka’s fictional tale thus expresses an intuition the author seems to have shared with the great scientist Helmholtz: that sound <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> space. This early theoretician of acoustical science had suggested that the ear is more sensitive to space than any other sense organ. The reason for this is that space is not a mere context or precondition for auditory activity. Rather, hearing could be understood as the perception of ever-so-slight changes in the medium, variations inaccessible to the rest of the human sensorium. Sound, for Helmholtz, consisted in space, and in particular in its fluid transformations.
	      </p>
<p>
		Helmholtz thus hit upon what literary critics might today call the convergence of the spatial turn and the acoustic turn. (Of course, he was doing science and trying to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> describe the physical world, whereas we are engaged in textual interpretation in order to describe literary phenomena; still, there is considerable crossover appeal.) We are all well-versed in the centrality of spatial forms for cultural understanding, and many of us are also familiar with the guiding role of acoustic and auditory experience for culture. This essay has aimed to demonstrate the intimate relationship of these discourses in modernist German literature. It thus challenges the conventional notion that space reveals itself to the eye and that the medium of sound, especially music, is time. Neither of these assumptions is wrong, but they are limiting—according to science, and according to literature. Indeed, the early twentieth century saw the birth of an entire field of science, architectural acoustics, out of the realization that space fundamentally determines how and what we hear. Musil’s, Rilke’s, and Kafka’s works not only reflect a cultural sensibility that has absorbed this lesson: they contain creative and disturbing reflections on the implications of this convergence of spatial and acoustic thought for modernist literary narrative.

		    This statement, in addition to playing on Marshall McLuhan’s famous dictum, reflects the ancient problem of distinguishing, in acts of sensation, among the sensing organ, the sensible object, and the medium in which the act of sensation takes place. If in acoustic sensation the line between the sensible object and the medium is blurred, in Aristotle’s account of tactile sensation the distinction between the organ and medium of touch is difficult to grasp.

		    Musil presents a significant exception. He studied under the influential experimental psychologist Carl Stumpf and wrote a dissertation on the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, famous for his work on the perception of moving objects and sounds. This paved the way for his interest in Gestalt psychology and psychotechnics, both psycho-scientific theories centrally concerned with subjective perceptual and cognitive processes. He was familiar with Stumpf’s work on acoustical phonetics and Erich Waetzmann’s studies on the perception of noises produced by military vehicles and weapons, both of which rely on Helmholtz’s theory of tone (Christoph Hoffmann, <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Dichter am Apparat: Medientechnik, Experimentalpsychologie und Texte Robert Musils 1899–1942</span> [Munich: Fink, 1997], 43–66, 141–56, 188–96, and 232–46).

		  This claim might seem overstated, given that Malte’s experience involves tactile sensation: he senses the rumblings of the streetcars with his entire body. It is hardly a coincidence that when hearing bleeds into another sense, it should be the sense of touch: for Aristotle all sensation was based  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on touch, and Helmholtz defined hearing as the subtle movements of the medium making contact with the ear.

		    Patricia Rae challenges the idea that creative imagination in modernist literature is always tied to a Romantic sensibility. There is ample evidence to suggest that a scientific understanding of the mind, derived especially from the empiricist psychology of William James, lies behind the idea of “inspiration” in modernist literature (Patricia Rae, “Modernism, Empirical Psychology and the Creative Imagination,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism</span>, vol. 1, ed. Astradur Eysteinsson and Vivian Liska [Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 2007], 405–18). While the Romantic impulse in Rilke’s account of creative imagination is undeniable, Rae’s suggestion is worth considering, especially in light of the technical, pseudo-scientific tone Malte adopts in this passage.

		    Michael Cowan’s essay on hearing in Rilke’s novel argues that it valorizes silence for the sake of meditation and inwardness. While these are important aspects of Malte’s acoustic experience, Cowan’s essay does not do justice to the creative potential that Malte discovers, perhaps unwittingly, in noise (Michael Cowan, “Imagining Modernity Through the Ear: Rilke’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge</span> and the Noise of Modern Life,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcadia</span> 41, no. 1 [2006]: 124–46).

<p>
      In a 1928 article published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bauhaus</span> magazine, Naum Gabo offers a timely, if scathing, critique of what he saw as the Bauhaus’s deterioration into a mere style factory nearly a decade after its founding. Titled simply “<span style="font-style:italic;">gestaltung</span>?” (i.e., “Design”) and punctuated with an accusatory question mark, Gabo’s article offers a critique of two Bauhaus lamps that is ultimately targeted against the cult of functionalism that had come into vogue in the post-war period.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The problem, for Gabo, wasn’t in functionalism per se, but in the use of such words to obscure an essentially decorative application. And the timing of the article itself corresponds not just with the rising specter of the 1930s, but also with an important change of guard at the Bauhaus as it underwent one of several important transformations. In this case, a total policy change was triggered in 1928 by the voluntary departure of Bauhaus director and founder, Walter Gropius, and the subsequent accession to power of Gabo’s friend, Hannes Meyer—a Marxist architect whom Gropius appointed as his replacement. Meyer’s stridently Marxist reformulation of what he saw as the Bauhaus’s increasingly aestheticized orientation led to an embattled, which is not to say unsuccessful, tenure there before he immigrated to Soviet Russia, Gabo’s homeland, in 1931. Gabo’s intervention in the Bauhaus debate of 1928 helps clarify the context-specific opposition between formalism and functionalism generated by that debate, but also helps situate Gabo’s own sculptural idiom and the oscillating critical reception of his work in the thirty plus years since his death in 1977.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      The criticism Gabo levels at the Bauhaus lamps is doubly meaningful because it metaphorically addresses problems of materiality and objectification that Gabo had come increasingly to work out in his own sculpture—through translucent materials, for example, and a shift in focus from the investigation of sculptural masses to a “stereometric” approach to space. Representations of his work in a 1931 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Das Neue Frankfurt</span> similarly underscore the affinity of Gabo’s art with lamps and lighting by juxtaposing three of his spatial constructions with two wall lamps by Otto Rittweger.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In other words, his choice of Bauhaus lamps as the means for a critique of functionalist discourse wasn’t purely accidental. A founding re of Russian Constructivism, Gabo’s innovative use of industrial materials (e.g., metal, glass, and newly developed plastics or celluloid) helped introduce a fresh set of materials to the more conventional materials of sculpture beginning in 1920. In the relatively new industry of plastics, this choice of materials earned Gabo unusual respect, as is evident, for example, in a 1938 article in the British technical journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Plastics</span>: “to us, perhaps, part of the delight [of Gabo’s constructions] was due to the brilliant technique involved, as any worker in cellulose acetate will admit.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      However it was also his constructive method that allowed him to transform the old ideas of volume and mass that had defined traditional, and even cubist, sculpture. In place of the more subjective processes of carving and molding, Gabo assembled forms from constituent parts that tended, in turn, to allow the generation of new possibilities even as they articulated one particular form. His constructive method, in other words, created a rubric of forms that could be manipulated much as if they were meant for mass production, rather than the creation of one-off aesthetic objects. As Herbert Read puts it, “his constructions are not <span style="font-style:italic;">objets d’art</span>; they belong to no bourgeois artistic tradition . . . [his] new materials and new methods of working are awaiting a new generation of artists to create with them the monuments of a new civilization.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Rather than simply offering these industrial materials as the new sculptural content, Gabo imported them to the heart of the sculptural task and developed a constructivism based on industrial methods. His constructivism is therefore related to that of Russian Constructivism proper, but would remain deeply critical of its tendency to perpetuate precisely the antiquated aesthetic ideology it claimed to dismiss.
    </p>
<p>
      The productivist strand of Russian Constructivism, led by res like Aleksandr Rodchenko, attacked art as such and demanded the entry of all artists into the factories. Gabo, however, found beneath this ostensibly radical gesture, a reactionary arts-andcrafts position inappropriate to the material needs and ideology of the new Soviet. As his “Design?” article reiterates in 1928, Gabo’s criticism of the Russian Constructivists in 1920–22 is based on the argument that any attempt to import artists into the factory would result in an aestheticization of industrial production, rather than the hoped for industrialization of art. Christina Lodder makes it clear that Gabo’s criticism of the extreme “productivist” position within Russian Constructivism was felt, even by his opponents, to carry real weight. She points out that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	the Productivist and the Constructivist were distinguished primarily by the difference in their relative commitments to the two halves of the art-industrial polarity . . . both were in danger of retreating to relatively traditional positions. Constructivism was warned at the time to “Beware of becoming a conventional artistic school” and the Productivist in the factory to “Beware of becoming an applied artist-craftsman.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Despite some successes, the Russian Constructivists failed to make the deep impact on industrial production for which they’d hoped. Gabo’s argument seems further born out by the fact that the Russian Constructivist influence on design was limited, for the most part, to precisely those aspects of industry that were closest to conventional artistic production: lithographs, printing, stage productions, films, and photography.
    </p>
<p>
      This negotiation of a working partnership between art and industry—one that doesn’t simply prefer one term or the other—was precisely the difficulty faced by the Bauhaus throughout its fourteen-year career. And Gabo’s intervention in the Bauhaus crisis of 1928 very clearly draws upon his heated participation in the Constructivists debates of 1920–1922. Indeed, there are a number of parallels between the Soviet design school, VChUTEMAS, and the Bauhaus: both were founded in 1919, both were state-sponsored institutions of design, and both sought to partner art and industry in the interest of mass production rather than handicrafts. The Bauhaus crisis of 1928 clearly echoes the earlier VCHuTEMAS discussions, but channels them through an opposition between purely utilitarian functionalism (advocated by Meyer and Gabo) and a stylistic formalism that takes the idea of functionalism as its inspiration.
    </p>
<p>
      Rather surprisingly, however, Gabo’s arguments against the aestheticization of industrial production have often been interpreted as a defense of precisely the reactionary aestheticism he was trying to t. In the last thirty years in particular, Gabo’s arguments against the “productivist” strain of Russian Constructivism have been used to reject the validity of his commitment to Marxism and inscribe his own work as “formalist.” Hal Foster, for example, situates Gabo’s work using the following Greimasian map of positions: Art (autonomous individual)/ Not-Production and Production (utilitarian, collective)/ Not-Art.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> According to Foster, Gabo’s constructivism fits between the first set of oppositions (Art/Not-Production) and the productivists between the second (Production/Not-Art). From this initial grid of oppositions, he concludes,
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	[although] both his early cubistic sculptures and later abstract constructions involve a quasi-Constructivist analysis of structure (as articulated in his 1920 <span style="font-style:italic;">Realistic Manifesto</span>), they are hardly materialist in a Marxian sense—on the contrary, they tend to dematerialization. Especially after his 1923 emigration, Gabo was resolutely committed to Art, indeed to spirit. The technophilic aspect of the work alludes to Production only to occlude its antinomy with Art, as social contradiction is masked by an aesthetic image of technological progress.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      In fact, Foster’s criticism echoes uncannily Gabo’s own criticism of the Bauhaus’s stylized functionalism. What’s interesting to me about Foster’s argument, moreover, is the fact that it rehashes the same logic that cold war critics used to exonerate Gabo in the 50s and 60s from the taint of his Soviet past and Communist sympathies.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      The Bauhaus debate of 1928 is therefore important, not only because it once again affirms Gabo’s commitment to Marxism, but also because it clarifies the tension in his constructions between the priority of (industrial) materials, on the one hand, and his work’s remarkable tendency towards “dematerialization” on the other. The “Design?” article, in other words, opens the possibility that Gabo’s constructivism has been critically misinterpreted from both the left and the right. I want to suggest that the problem is not just Gabo’s putative reactionary/capitalist or Marxist/radical position, a simplified grid of positions that is itself problematic. The danger of such a critical matrix is its failure to address his career-long search for a genuinely Marxist materialism, what I will call an enlightened materialism, rather than a Marxism that simply reiterates, through its fetish of the mass-produced object, all the problems and inequalities of commodity culture. To be clear, I am not suggesting that somehow Gabo arrives at a kind of utopic Marxist materialism, nor that the Constructivist worship of industrial production exactly corresponds to capitalist commodification. In fact, an important component of Gabo’s enlightened materialism, so to speak, was his long-standing defense of the category of art, and of artistic production as something that is distinct from industrial production without claiming to be transcendent. His doubled interest in materialism and art was ultimately an attempt to rethink the art object as such, but also the role of objects and their use value for individual and social life.
    </p>
<p>
      In his history of Constructivism, Gabo remarks that it was largely a reaction against the Suprematists, who seemed to have “detached themselves completely from the terrestrial world and had taken themselves off to a region of the irrational which was elevated above every reality.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> In their reaction against that “spiritual leap into the metaphysical,” the group of Constructivists to which Gabo belonged felt that “this spiritual condition could have meant actual death for art. Then, however, we were all young and greedy for life, we wanted to create, we wanted to be regarded as an active force in life.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> There is sometimes a slippery boundary in his writings between the metaphysical and the “irrational” that is part of human and material reality, but it is the latter that Gabo sought to embody—or rather disembody—in his work. The word “irrational” is somewhat misleading, though, because he courted it most intensely through his rationalistic, scientific, industrialized idiom. I am reminded of Marx’s comment in the opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Das Kapital</span>, that “the commodity is firstly an external object, a thing, that through its properties satisfies human needs of some kind. The nature of these needs, whether they correspond, for example, to the stomach or to fantasy, doesn’t make a difference.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> In some ways, one might argue that Gabo was simply trying to categorize art as a thing that satisfies needs of a uniquely human, even spiritual nature. His work thus attempts to recast the spiritual—in the German, particularly Hegelian sense of <span style="font-style:italic;">Geist—</span>as immanent and indeed necessary to lived, material reality.
    </p>
<p>
      More to the point, art for Gabo is preeminently a social phenomenon, a kind of medium for communication and human intercourse. When I speak of his enlightened materialism, then, I am referring to his channeling of the irrational or spiritual (the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geistlich</span>) without ever attempting to transcend material, human existence. This dialectically red goal is worked out, in part, through a critique of the Constructivist  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> cult of production which, in Gabo’s eyes, embraced Marxist materialism only to fetishize production and material objects as such. The problem, in other words, is that the productivists were paradoxically enacting a reified worldview that came to bear an uncanny resemblance to that of commodity culture per se. The transparent materials of his constructions serve, therefore, to destabilize the fetishistic faith in production partly by exposing the spectral nature of the fetish and partly by substituting for objects in and of themselves their socially relational character. In related fashion, Marx explains the commodity fetish through an analogy with the illusion of seeing itself: impressions of light reflected from things are not experienced as the subjective charm of the eye nerve itself, but rather as external objects. However, Marx tells us, “with seeing real light is reflected from one thing, the external object, onto another thing, the eye. It is a physical relationship between physical things.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Insofar as Gabo’s work is fundamentally an exploration of seeing, it is also for him very explicitly an exploration of relationality. To that end his work not only amplifies reflectivity and transparencies, thus disorienting our faith in classical perspective and reified material reality, it also calls into question, or better yet dis-closes, the self-enclosed reality of objects as such. He presents us, in other words, with the dialectical phenomenon of a dematerializing materiality.
    </p>
<p>
      This dematerializing tendency is underscored in a 1931 article about Gabo’s work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Form</span> magazine: “He liberates himself from compacted massiness through both his design principles and choice of materials, from which he builds his plastic-spatial constructions. By using metal and glass almost exclusively, he is able to use lines and planes to construct his forms, which already through their very materials possess a striking immateriality.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Reproduced there is his sculpture, “In Suspension,” which embodies the mathematical principles, dematerializing effects, and industrial paradigm of his work. Intersecting celluloid planes interact with white opaque planes, as do circular and linear and rectangular shapes, all of which work together to deprive the eye of any stabilizing dimensional mass. American collector Katherine Dreier highlights this shift from volume and mass to space: “Formerly sculpture was only represented by volume of an enclosed circumference, creating a mass form in space, broken by outward irregularities of contour. By adding depth he created a new dimension.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In place of mass, there is a sense of interpenetration and movement, as if the traditional sculptural mass, the self-enclosed object, is divulging itself of its materiality but not its reality.
    </p>
<p>
      Or perhaps we could say that beneath the illusory stability of static materiality, Gabo cultivates a dynamism that is a function of space, time, light, and movement. Though he adopted a mathematical and scientific idiom, he was adamant that his work was no more science than it was industrial production per se: “The reference I so often make here to science and my claim for the artist’s right should not be understood as meaning that I consider visual art and science exactly the same thing. I am not claiming my work to be a work of science.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In their 1925 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Kunstismen</span>, El Lissitzky and Hans Arp reproduce Gabo’s work as a demonstration of Constructivist principles, which they characterize as a “look[ing] at the world through the prisma [sic] of technic [ . . . ]. The shortsighteds [sic] see therein only the machine. Constructivism proves that the limits between mathematics and art, between a work of art and a technical invention are not to be fixed.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> If those limits are not fixed, however, neither are they non-existent.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      In the context of industrial production, it is precisely these questions of limits or boundaries, both technical and ideological, that Gabo addresses when he questions Bauhaus functionalism. But the fixing or unfixing of such boundaries was also deeply political and in 1928 corresponded with institutional upheaval within the Bauhaus itself. Consistent with its demands for rationalist design, the Bauhaus began its influential, if protean, existence in the classical environment of Weimar, but would continue to face the continual turmoil plaguing the new republic itself. Walter Gropius had fought both bankruptcy and Johannes Itten’s spiritualist-aesthetic pedagogy for several years before precipitating Itten’s departure in 1923. But it was only in 1924 that the Bauhaus faced its first major crisis. When the city of Weimar withdrew financial and ideological support in 1924, the Bauhaus was forced then, as it would be in 1932, to either relocate or close its doors. After moving slightly north to the city of Dessau in 1925, Walter Gropius invited Hannes Meyer to join him in the architectural faculty before departing himself and leaving Meyer as his successor. But Gropius’s choice of successor was not a popular one, either internally or externally. Moholy-Nagy and other Bauhaus faculty, for example, chose to leave in protest rather than accept the new, and for them unwelcome, direction towards which Meyer made it clear he would push the Bauhaus. But that internal upheaval would be repeated externally in just two short years, by which time Meyer’s Marxist prerogatives had become intolerable to the city of Dessau and its Mayor, Fritz Hesse. Despite the appointment of Mies van der Rohe to replace Meyer, the increasingly right-wing Dessau would withdraw all funding from the Bauhaus in 1932 and the once famous glass and iron structure, designed specifically for the school by Walter Gropius, became home to local NSDAP offices. At that time, the Bauhaus fled to Berlin before being shut down completely by the Nazis less than a year later.
    </p>
<p>
      Appropriately, then, the transformation signaled in 1928 by Meyer’s radical politics was not accompanied by any comfortable celebrations of the Bauhaus success, but rather with a bleak reappraisal of the Bauhaus track record. As Ernst Kállai writes in his editorial of another Bauhaus issue of 1928, “The Bauhaus lives! The change of guard at the Bauhaus [ . . . ] has been publicly described again and again as a crisis that means the beginning of the end for the institute.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Of course Kállai, who co-edited the magazine with Meyer, went on to proclaim against all pessimism, “the Bauhaus, however, will pull through to greater successes.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> The inclusion of Gabo’s article was meant to consolidate Meyer’s radically utilitarian position against those elements that had contributed to what all three saw as its disintegration into a superficial cultural force.
    </p>
<p>
      In accord with Meyer and Kállai’s views, the position Gabo puts forward in his “Design?” article is based on a commitment to historical materialism—what the Russian constructivists liked to call “scientific communism”—that vehemently rejects stylistic manipulation pretending to functionalism. It is precisely for the Bauhaus’s ostensible obeisance to such economic design that Gabo takes it to task: “words like ‘design,’ ‘economy,’ ‘functionalism,’ and ‘objectivity,’” he points out, “can be found in every modern magazine that discusses the new in art.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1928 as in 1920, Gabo argued that one of the biggest problems facing the leftist avant-garde was not the dangers of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> aesthetic spiritualism or introversion. The gravest threat was instead to be found in the mistaken fetishism of mass production and materialism as an end in itself, rather than a means to an enlightened, which is to say non-fetishistic, Marxism. Like Meyer, Gabo was a historical materialist, but saw a danger in allowing objects and materiality itself to absorb the humanist and visionary energy of the communist revolution, which he would support for the rest of his life.
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	In his “Design?” article, Gabo goes on to argue that Man must master the object, he must stand in a superior relation to the object of consumption. The object exists only for man to use. It wants to disappear or, at the very least, be less conspicuous and disruptive when one no longer needs it. For in that instant there’s already another object available to fulfill its function.
      </p>
<div class="attrib">
	(“Gest,” 6)
      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	It’s important to recognize, however, that Gabo’s critique of object fetishism, particularly the kind that hides itself under the guise of functionalism, is not a rejection of the object or materiality as such—quite the opposite. What Gabo imagines is instead a world of objects, a superfluity of objects that are constantly being replaced and transformed according to the human needs of a communist collective. And if we bracket for a moment his vision of proliferation—that is, the abundance of objects that are always replacing themselves—we can see that Gabo is really calling for the kind of object that his art was always attempting to embody: the perpetually transformative object, or, to put it another way, the object in motion, the object defined almost as motion itself. Usually considered the founder of kinetic sculpture, Gabo’s interest in motion was primarily invested in what movement revealed: the fluidity of space/time and a deterritorialization of mass and volume. In place of the fetish object that he claims the Bauhaus had helped popularize, Gabo proposes another object whose very identity as an object is defined by a protean materiality that paradoxically acquires all the traits of an equally protean immateriality. Taken in conjunction with the tendency of his constructions towards illumination and de-materialization—Steven Nash refers to Gabo’s constructions as instruments of light as one might say instruments of music—what we encounter in Gabo’s constructivism is not an industrially inspired “formalism,” but rather an attempt to save Marxist culture from the substitution of commodity fetishism for the organized satisfaction of collective need.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Contrary to claims that Gabo’s constructivism capitulates to a bourgeois defense of the aesthetic, his work is rather mobilized against the tainting of communism by the objectifying logic of the capitalist system it theoretically rejects. One might say that he wants to prevent communism from consuming itself.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Gabo’s article takes the Bauhaus to task for its deferral to mere style, a charge that goes right to the heart of the historical avant-garde’s anti-art aesthetic, his proposed antidote to commodity fetishism acquires certain traits of the style system that it claims to debunk. One finds, in other words, that his dematerializing materialism avoids commodity fetishism not by rejecting the protean aspect of style, but rather by exploding it. It would be a mistake, however, to confuse Gabo’s final rejection of the reified object as an end in itself, continually remade through a semiotics of style that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seems incongruous with historical materialism and materialism per se. Gabo’s vision of abundant objects is offered rather as a means to make objects less, rather than more, important than the needs they satisfy. And Gabo’s article is particularly critical of the vogue for functionalism that the Bauhaus had, in his view, irresponsibly disseminated: a stylistic insatiety that nevertheless pretends to real “Sachlichkeit,” “Ökonomie,” and “Gestalt.” By proposing a world in which objects proliferate according to genuine need, Gabo seeks to inoculate Marxism against capitalist consumption without denying consumption its necessary place in human society: objects, he argues, “are necessary in the human sphere, but must fulfill their functions.” (“Gest,” 6)
      </p>
<p>
	Once we take into account the paradoxes of Gabo’s distinction between genuine and saccharine “Sachlichkeit,” his decision to discuss this problem in relation to the Bauhaus lamps suggests that the lamp is, for him, more than the tangential object of interest that the article might otherwise indicate. In the first major retrospective of his work in 1985–7, Nash clarifies that Gabo was not the first to use materials like metal or glass, but his
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  use of these new materials went further than both the implied transparency of Cubist sculpture and the suggestion of transparency in abstract Russian painting, and can also be compared with the contemporary turn in architectural design towards the use of glass for structural and ideological purposes.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	And yet the seeming rejection of materiality implied by this “tendency toward dematerialization” is explicitly denied by the very priority that such materials acquire in his work, both through their industrial references and through his process of depersonalized construction (rather than “creation” or “composition”). Without attempting to recuperate or critique his reputation, I want to suggest that Gabo’s fluctuating critical reception in the last thirty years is due largely to a confusion between dematerialization per se, a counter-materialist mode, and a more dialectically red dematerializing-materiality conducive to what I call enlightened materialism.
      </p>
<p>
	Gabo’s discussion of the Bauhaus lamps, which he finds indicative of the Bauhaus’s failure generally, begins with the almost casual question, “Why should a candelabra from the palace of Marie Antoinette be scorned as ‘decorative,’ and a circular or cubically inspired lighting fixture be termed ‘design’?” (“Gest,” 2). Printed below this question is the reproduction of a seventeenth-century French chandelier that, on the next page, is juxtaposed by two more reproductions, this time of a Jugendstil chandelier and the sheer sphericality of a Bauhaus hanging lamp. Gabo’s accusation takes the form of a stylistic genealogy proposed to undercut the Bauhaus’s claim to newness and purified functionality. His comparison with a pre-revolutionary French fixture is obviously meant to expose the class politics beneath Bauhaus design. Equally troubling, however, is the similarity between the Jugendstil fixture and the unnamed Bauhaus table lamp. With its half-dome glass shade, industrially-inspired materials, and preference for geometrical lines, the lamp pictured in Gabo’s article resembles the iconic Bauhaus table lamp codesigned by Carl Jucker and Wilhelm Wagenfeld, one of several Bauhaus productions to enter the halls of design history.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Whereas the truly functional object should give  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> way, according to Gabo’s opinion, when it is no longer needed, or when it no longer provides the best satisfaction of that need, the long cultural life of this “functional” lamp seems to confirm Gabo’s suspicion that the opposite often takes place: “when one no longer needs an object, it sets its functional existence aside and becomes independent, it destroys our power and threatens to conquer our spirit” (“Gest,” 6). Although writing in 1928, Gabo has rather presciently anticipated the afterlife of the Jucker/Wagenfeld lamp, as of the Bauhaus “style factory” generally.
      </p>
<p>
	Although the Wagenfeld lamp’s pared-down form and industrial references are meant to connote a kind of pure functionalism, Gabo’s comparison of it to the exaggerated formalism of both the Jugendstil and Baroque movements questions the Bauhaus’s claims to functionalist anti-formalism. It also arouses the old ghost of Bauhaus aestheticism and arts-and-craftiness that Gropius had tried to exorcise in 1924, along with Johannes Itten. But Gabo makes it clear that the force of his argument lies not on the superficial resemblance of these lamps, but rather to the fact that “in this object the core remains essentially the same, the identity of the object hasn’t changed, it’s simply been dressed up in another form”(“Gest,” 4). Gabo’s reference to the object’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Wesen</span> is not so much ontological as it is structural and functional. And it is precisely the conjunction of these two factors—structure and function—that Gabo feels obliged to rename “Konstruktion” in order to differentiate it from the already diluted category of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gestalt</span> preferred by the Bauhaus. In order to clarify this distinction, Gabo supplements these illustrations with drawings of truly constructive innovations in lighting technology: an oil lamp, candle, gas lantern, and electric lightbulb. His point is that the technology itself determines its appropriate form; all else is relegated to the status of window dressing.
      </p>
<p>
	The force of his argument comes simply from demanding of the Bauhaus the functional design it claims to offer. As he clarifies, “the real aesthetic of utilitarian objects lies not in their appearance but in their use” (“Gest,” 5). In contrast to construction, Gabo argues that the trendy design and savvy industrial connotations of the Jucker/ Wagenfeld lamp was built “as if it was built by an engineer or technician,” an “as if” that is, according to Gabo, “a danger, against which the developing generation of young ‘design-engineers’ can’t be warned enough” (“Gest,” 4–5). The problem of the Bauhaus, in other words, is not just style <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, but the stylized simulacra of functional construction that both imitates genuine design and threatens to supercede it. In fact, Wagenfeld himself later recalled that the industrial connotations of his lamp were largely illusory because the industrialists they consulted found it impractical for large-scale production. As Magdalena Droste remarks in her short history of the Jucker/Wagenfeld lamp, “Industry couldn’t be won over. The light, however, remains a symbol for the modern will of the Bauhaus: a victory of beautiful appearance and powerfully symbolic form over pure functionalism.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although Droste seems enamored of the lamp, Gabo considered the similar lamps pictured in the article a failure for the same reasons.
      </p>
<p>
	Of course the polemical tone of Gabo’s article was also agitating for Meyer’s intended program of a more stringent Marxist functionalism. In the following issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bauhaus</span> magazine, editors Meyer and Kállai made sure to include Marianne Brandt’s resentful, and very likely representative, response to the Meyer-Gabo critique of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Bauhaus. As a former student at the Bauhaus, and leader of the metal workshop after Moholy-Nagy’s departure, Brandt is responsible for some of the most successful, and aside from the Wagenfeld-Jucker’s creation, most familiar lamps generated by the Bauhaus. In contrast to Gabo’s five-page article, Brandt’s short response is understandably chilly in tone and consists mostly of denying his charge of simulated functionalism. If we take into consideration the fact that Brandt’s lighting fixtures constitute one of the more successful partnerships with industrial production, it’s clear that Gabo and Meyer’s criticism has less to do with the fact of that partnership than with the ideological direction it ought to take.
      </p>
<p>
	Gabo’s opposition to the Bauhaus style wasn’t meant to discredit the Bauhaus altogether, but rather to push it toward the stark functionalism that Meyer advocated as a means to total social organization along Marxist lines. In an editorial commentary in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bauhaus</span> magazine, the newly-promoted Meyer offers a formula for reversing the Bauhaus’s putative deterioration that recalls the anti-art creed of the Russian Constructivists: “Construction and design are one, and they are a social phenomenon. As an institute of design, the Bauhaus Dessau is not an aesthetic, but rather a social phenomenon.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> And this difference between the social and artistic, he clarifies, is the radical organization of society in every aspect: “<span style="font-style:italic;">eine Organisationsform des Daseins</span>,” an organizational form for existence itself, existence as a social phenomenon.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Such fundamental re-organization, according to Meyer, Kállai and Gabo, could only be achieved by sacrificing the tidal modishness of stylized formalism in favor of groundup, rationalized contributions to a new social structure.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Gabo and Meyer differ in their understanding of art, they are in agreement in their sense of design and construction, both on how the terms had degenerated over the last ten years, and on how they should be revitalized for the future. Gabo’s argument, in fact, hinges less on a critique of the Bauhaus style, as on their use of the term design, which he suggests belies a fundamental confusion between formalistic innovation and genuine constructive contribution. The vogue for words like design, Gabo charges, had not only emptied them of meaning, but resulted in their complete inversion: “to find in the forms of today’s technical, constructed world and goods for consumption a replacement for art is a sentimental romanticism, of inestimably greater danger than the moony romanticism of our forefathers, who fell to their knees before every dug-up stone of the past” (“Gest,” 5). Design, according to Gabo, involves a superficial reverence for the industrial worker that, far from revising the traditional task of the artist, actually preserves it against the needs of a communist and genuinely rational culture. The fetish made of technology and economic functionalism, in other words, had nothing to do with technology or economy, but rather stemmed from a kind of romanticized fascination with the technological world as an end in itself.
      </p>
<p>
	It is important to point out that Gabo’s argument is mustered not to send art back to the pre-industrial world, but rather to exorcise from the constructive will an objectifying logic that belongs more properly to commodity culture. As the famously scientific and technical idiom of Gabo’s own art clarifies, his critique was explicitly not directed at the Bauhaus’s invocation of industry, mathematical rationality and economy, but  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rather at the incomplete importation of such terms. The result is, according to Gabo, a muddying of both art and genuinely functionalist construction. Gabo argues that the danger of such aestheticized or formalistic functionalism is that “we therefore run the danger of making an idol of the object” (“Gest,” 5). It is precisely the object-fetish that Gabo’s constructions attempt to desecrate.

	Dearstyne’s recollection makes it clear that Meyer had won over enough of the students that his departure was accompanied by a near student rebellion, involving direct challenges to Mies’s authority and even the Dessau police. Dearstyne remembers that when Mies first arrived,
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  I had never heard of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weissenhofsiedlung</span>, the Barcelona Pavilion, and the rest of Mies’ executed works and projects. But certain of the students who were acquainted with them claimed that they were formalistic and that Mies built mansions for the wealthy when he should have provided dwellings for the poor.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	If the initial difficulty for both the Bauhaus and its Soviet counterpart, the VChUTEMAS, was to partner itself to industry without falling back into the older arts-and-crafts tradition, the vogue for design and objectivity that the Bauhaus helped popularize  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> transformed the surface terms of the handiwork tradition without fundamentally altering its class-bound aesthetic. As Gabo’s article makes clear, the earlier opposition between industrial production and arts-and-crafts had simply been re-written as a tension between genuine functionalism and a new formalism inspired by the idea of functionalism.
      </p>
<p>
	Ludwig Grote, the Dessau museum curator who’d been seminal in bringing the Bauhaus to Dessau in 1926, remarks that “it has become fashionable to assign the term functionalism to the new architectural movement which began in the early twenties, and to look upon the Bauhaus as the orthodox representation of form derived from function only”(“Mies,” 217). Although Grote sympathizes with Gropius rather than Meyer, he calls attention, like Gabo, to the diverse and often antipathetic positions organized by the same rubric of terms: “design,” “functionalism,” “economy.” Gabo never takes Gropius specifically task, but the force of his criticism depends precisely on those aspects of Gropius’s “functionalism” that Grote singles out for praise. Whereas Meyer “advocated, theoretically, the narrow view that form should be determined by function only [ . . . ] called himself a scientific Marxist and attempted to understand human needs by means of Socialism, tables, and calculations and to eliminate the irrational influence of art,” Gropius’s functionalism is, for Grote, mediated by a desire to humanize functionalism and make it aesthetically palatable (“Mies,” 217).
      </p>
<p>
	The mass-producible types that Gropius sought to produce are interpreted by Grote as proof that his functionalism is distinctly different from what he sees as Meyer’s too calculated, indeed inhuman, functionalism. He points out that “Gropius denied even then that the Bauhaus represented an apotheosis of rationalism,” and then cites Gropius’s comment that “I have always emphasized that aspect of life which considers satisfying emotional and spiritual needs equally as important as satisfying material needs; and which sees a new concept of space as something more than mere structural economy and functional perfection [ . . . ]. The slogan ‘if it’s functional then it’s beautiful’ is only half true” (“Mies,” 217). Clearly the distinction between functionalism and formalism is a dangerously plastic one that can be used by very different groups to advocate very different positions. And yet the very slipperiness of such terms raises the possibility that the difference between functionalism and formalism might hang precariously, even if inexplicitly, on their respective political commitment to the social collective. The question, in other words, might not just be the relation of art to industry that is, and was, so often debated, but rather the particular social or political uses to which such a partnership might be put. And perhaps as importantly, one is forced to ask why such antipathetic positions (like those Grote attributes to Gropius and Meyer) nevertheless share such similar terms.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Gabo was only tied to the Bauhaus through his article and intellectual coterie, his criticism of it comes not from the outside, but rather from someone who had himself helped secure the aesthetic currency of “design,” “functionalism,” and “economy” after the First World War. Gabo, for example, had collaborated directly on radical new journals like <span style="font-style:italic;">G, Material zur elementaren Gestaltung</span>, published by Mies van der Rohe in 1923; as well as on the Berlin-based, tri-lingual journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Vesch/Gegenstand/</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Objet,</span> edited by Gabo’s Russian colleague, El Lissitzky. And even when he didn’t offer such direct contribution, Gabo’s constructions and ground-breaking <span style="font-style:italic;">Realistic Manifesto</span> of 1920 were widely reproduced and discussed in a host of other design and constructivist journals at the time. In the early 20s, these included eastern avant-garde journals like <span style="font-style:italic;">MA, Egyse’g</span> (both Hungarian), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Stavba</span> (Prague); as well as western-European design periodicals of the late 20s and 30s like <span style="font-style:italic;">i10</span> (Amsterdam), <span style="font-style:italic;">ABC Beitraege zum Bauen</span> (Basil), <span style="font-style:italic;">Das Neue Frankfurt</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Form,</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bauhaus</span> magazine.
      </p>
<p>
	When he arrived in Berlin in 1922, moreover, Gabo was part of the historical <span style="font-style:italic;">Erste Russische Kunst Ausstellung</span> at the van Diemen Gallery, the first international exhibition of Russian art, avant-garde or otherwise, since the 1917 revolution.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The high visibility of works by El Lissistzky, Rodchenko, Tatlin, and Gabo himself not only help turn the tide of the German avant-garde away from Dadaism and Expressionism, but also consolidated the rationalist, constructivist agenda proposed in Weimar by the Bauhaus in 1919. As a result, words like design, constructivism and economy were quickly on everybody’s lips as part of a general, if diverse, cultural movement that, by 1928, Gabo could already lament as diluted. Such terms, of course, had been catapulted into the cultural register in part by both the Russian Constructivists, with whom Gabo had earlier been associated, and the so-called International Constructivism that included, loosely and less programmatically, <span style="font-style:italic;">De Stijl</span> in Amsterdam and the Bauhaus in Germany.
      </p>
<p>
	The popular respect for technology and economy that these movements generated was initially directed against post-war ennui and the old social order responsible for the war in the first place. But by 1928, such celebrations of rationality, science and industry could already be charged with the kind of superficial fashionableness that they’d been invoked originally to eradicate. The revolutionary impulse toward a material and comprehensive reorganization of society had ceded to an ornamentalism of industry and <span style="font-style:italic;">Technik</span>. Gabo, like Meyer, conscientiously qualifies his otherwise technocratic vision in order to differentiate it from the technophilia that both men accused Gropius’s pedagogy of turning into a mere affectation. Rather than offering a technological cureall, both men insist that <span style="font-style:italic;">Technik</span> is less important in and of itself than as a means to the consistent ordering of the social totality. The <span style="font-style:italic;">neue Sachlichkeit</span> to which the Bauhaus had already contributed is, in other words, renewed—with stress on the ordering of material reality rather than a simple reification of materiality itself.
      </p>
<p>
	In a 1926 article for the Swiss periodical <span style="font-style:italic;">Das Werk</span>, Meyer offered the stark formulations that he would in two-year’s time inculcate at the Bauhaus, Dessau. Meyer’s contribution was appropriately titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Die neue Welt</span> and consumed most of the edition in which it appeared.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In what amounted to a manifesto both for himself and for functionalist, socialist architecture, Meyer proclaimed
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  . . . grain silo, music hall, airfield, office chair, standardized goods. All these things are a product of the formula: Function times Economy. They are not works of art. Art is composition, purpose is function [ . . . ] construction is a technical, not an aesthetic process and the function of a house rejects composition again and again. Rationally and elementarily designed, <span style="font-style:italic;">our house for living becomes a machine for living</span>[sic].<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Meyer’s argument is clearly motivated by the general spirit of <span style="font-style:italic;">die neue Sachlichkeit</span> and functional rationality that seemed so attractive after the First World War. But it also, and perhaps more importantly, works to secure that spirit for a Marxist rather than capitalist culture.
      </p>
<p>
	And as the new director of the Bauhaus, Meyer would continue to push strenuously for this alliance despite great opposition from the city of Dessau itself. In an August, 1930 letter, Meyer describes the process of his removal from the Bauhaus and makes it clear that he was fired by the increasingly right-wing city of Dessau for his commitment to Marxism. Meyer, for example, explains that in a July meeting with the Dessau mayor, he was censured for privately donating his own money to the I.A.H. (<span style="font-style:italic;">International Arbeiters-Hilfe</span>) and told in no uncertain terms, “. . . dass ein Marxist unmöglich Leiter des Bauhauses sein könne.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Elsewhere he was wrongly charged with politicizing the Bauhaus and starting, among other things, Marxist cells within the school that had harassed uncooperative teachers.
      </p>
<p>
	Philipp Tolziner, a student of the Bauhaus who earned his diploma in 1930, joined a group of former students who followed the ousted Meyer to the Soviet Union in 1931. In his memoir of the time, Tolziner explains the attractions both of Meyer’s pedagogy and the move to Soviet Russia:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  One can’t forget that we’d already had political experience despite our youth. We’d all lived through the first world war, from the start of the war right up until the November Revolution. I was witness to the suppression of the Munich Republic, as well as to the first wave of national socialism after the Hitler putsch in Munich.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Meyer’s students fought the right-wing pressure with strikes and demonstrations, but Dessau and Mayor Hesse were adamant in their opposition. Van der Rohe was called in to replace Meyer, and seven of the students followed Meyer to the Soviet Union four months after he had himself departed.
      </p>
<p>
	Meyer’s flight to the Soviet constitutes in many ways a closing of the circle begun by the Soviet avant-garde’s exportation of ideas to Germany through the Van Dieman Gallery exhibition in 1922. And yet, Meyer’s desire to constructively contribute to the social re-organization of the Soviet Union comes sadly late. By 1928 the Constructivist movement in Russia had, for all practical purposes, dissolved from both internal and external pressures—a death that would be finalized by Stalin’s proclamation, in 1932, of socialist realism as the official communist aesthetic. Indeed, Meyer would be forced by political pressure to leave Russia for Mexico after six years of working for the Soviet. As a member of the Russian avant-garde, Gabo had in fact left Moscow for Berlin in 1922 because, even then, support for the leftist avant-garde was quickly giving way to a consolidation of reactionary political and aesthetic control. Lodder helps clarify Gabo’s position, both in relation to his homeland and to the Russian avant-garde, by referring us to his diary around the time of Mayakovskii’s suicide: “Mayakovskii was a poet of genius, but the bastards consumed him. The millstone of materialistic ideology and a mechanical ideology crushed Mayakovskii.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> With that in mind, Gabo’s “Design?” article clearly outlines his battle against materialism or objectivity as an end in itself—which is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> not to say, against materials or objects as means. At the same time, however, it doesn’t necessarily address what Gabo’s work is, in a larger sense, mobilized against. That is, Gabo’s commitment to historical materialism and the communist revolution was not at all compromised by his refusal of materialism as an end in itself. For Gabo and, to a lesser extent, for Meyer, the dangers facing communism was not its difference from capitalism, but rather its uncanny similarity; that is to say, what most threatened to compromise communism in their eyes was its capacity to reiterate, rather than reject, the objectifying logic of commodity culture.
      </p>
<p>
	By nevertheless importing the language of mathematics and industry to art, however, Gabo was able to court a dissociation of the object as such so as to reclaim materialism from the instrumental logic of capitalism. Gabo often described his constructive technique in terms of stereometry, which Lodder notes stems from the language of mathematics. He usually explained the grounds of his stereometric method by referring to two instructional cubes that he exhibited in Moscow along with the early rative works. The first cube is rendered in terms of its surfaces, which as in traditional sculpture, are mistaken for a solid volume of mass. The second square, defined by its lines and ligaments rather than surfaces, clarifies the space in which the first cube exists, and which it, at the same time, conceals. In “Sculpture: Carving and Construction in Space,” Gabo explains that the first cube “represents a volume of mass; the second represents the space in which the mass exists made visible. Volume of mass and volume of space are sculpturally not the same thing.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Gabo’s stereometric method is a clarification of the relationship between space, mass and volume, an opening up of the sculptural body that reveals a dynamic space in which things exist and can change.
      </p>
<p>
	The construction (or reconstruction) of forms in space using the stereometric method allows Gabo to quite literally illuminate the interior of an object in a way that reveals its own dynamic existence. The material object as such yields to a sense of its immateriality, not with the purpose of denying its material existence, but rather to expose the mechanics of that existence in the world. If forces (and the field in which those forces operate) are the central revelation of Gabo’s work, light and lightness are the means to that revelation. The result is a communist aesthetic that works toward what I have called enlightened materialism in order to distinguish it from what Gabo perceived as the objectifying logic of the commodity form. The industrial and scientific connotations evident in all Gabo’s work, as well as his interest in design itself, make it clear that he had no desire to jettison consumer or industrial objects, simply to subordinate them as means to human collective life.
      </p>
<p>
	In contrast to the industrial tropes (and aggressive rhetoric) of futurism, Gabo argues that if you
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  ask any Futurist how does he imagine “speed” and there will emerge a whole arsenal of frenzied automobiles . . . [but] does one really need to convince them that all that is not necessary for speed and for its rhythms? Look at a ray of sun . . . the stillest of the still forces, it speeds more than 300 kilometers in a second . . . behold our starry firmament . . . who hears it . . . and yet what are our depots to those depots of the Universe? What are our earthly trains to those hurrying trains of the galaxies?<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	His response to the objects of Futurist fascination—automobiles, cities, weapons, machines for speed—is, in fact, resonant with his developing critique of functionalist style qua style. Both, according to Gabo, looked to industrial modernity as a new religion that was all the more mystical for pretending to <span style="font-style:italic;">Sachlichkeit</span>. In contrast, Gabo refers the world of consumer objects to a physical context that has the effect of grounding them in lived, biological reality, which is to say, real use value rather than spectral exchange value. One finds in his ray of sun, “the stillest of forces,” a poetic, but nevertheless scientific, trope that will recur more and more powerfully in all of his subsequent work. I would suggest that this conjunction of speed and lightness— which provides the motivation for his famous use of plastics, glass and shiny metals, as well as his spectacular stringing techniques and formal rhythms—involves a radical renunciation of the art object as an object to be consumed by the viewer. Indeed the sense of movement conveyed in his work through play of light and formal rhythms prevent the aesthetically complete forms from ever seducing the viewer into a false sense of formal closure. The inability to “finish” his works serves as an alternative to the consumption of art objects; art for Gabo is rather to be experienced as life itself, without ever trying to be identical with it.

      “Imagination,” asserted the journalist John Hollingshead in Dickens’s weekly <span style="font-style:italic;">All the Year Round</span> in 1861, “loves to run wild about underground London, or the sub-ways of any great city.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Seldom, however, have imaginings about the subterranean nineteenth century been unequivocally pleasurable in substance. When praising the order and cleanliness of the modern technology that provided water, drainage, gas, telegraph, transportation, and electricity to the metropolis, scientific discourse never fails to reveal a concomitant concern over the consequences of a failure of technology to fulfill its promise: disorder, accident, death. Nor, for that matter, can one quite bring oneself to describe the scientistic discourse of progress as more than an extremely attenuated form of pleasure. In contrast, there is certainly pleasure and desire at stake in the nineteenth-century fascination with poverty, crime, sex, drugs, and other attributes of the human underbelly of the modern city. Nevertheless, journalistic and literary discourses never fail to displace that desire by measuring the cost of excessive dabbling in the urban underworld. Like the Hays Code that mandated the punishment of any deviant behavior before the closing credits of mid-century Hollywood films, codes of nineteenth-century visual and verbal representation ensured that very seldom indeed would any alternative space or behavior in the city receive a wholly positive representation.
    </p>
<p>
      This should strike us as an unusual state of affairs, for the topics located underground during the nineteenth century—utopian hope in progress and the improvement of the city and desire for individual pleasure—are fundamental sources of happiness.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> In political terms, this situation is perfectly comprehensible: however technocratic it may appear, subterranean infrastructure promised to resolve the pressing problems of sanitation and circulation that arose from the population explosion in nineteenth-century cities such as London and Paris, while progressive authorities and radical activists were appalled by the conditions of the urban poor and exploitative structures within the criminal and sexual underworlds that were most effectively represented as infernal. Consequently, both discourses presented themselves as pragmatic, rationalistic, and sober responses to grave problems of the modern city, with no place for excess of any kind. But excess has long been a characteristic attributed to the underground, as subterranean space has accreted to itself associations both with hell and with paradise, with imprisonment and with shelter, with punishment and with pleasure. What occurs in the dominant framework described above is that pleasure and desire cease to be articulated directly as such, and representations of underground space become split between a technological utopianism and a social miserabilism. The nature of the split manages to excise key and imaginatively powerful elements of the conventional associations of the underground: to wit, the happiness to be derived from the pursuit of individual desire and of social action. The mythic conventions that had located the Elysian Fields within the Roman underworld or romance and adventure within the Celtic otherworld were transformed into the anodyne and universal pleasure of an efficient drainage system and a congestion-free transit system. The individualistic pleasures of the mythic underground manifested themselves only in the highly displaced form of transgressively animal desires, invariably base, selfish, and self-conflictive, and invariably punished severely, either through legal strictures or through narrative conventions. These twinned threads of underground discourse continued to dominate urban writing through the twentieth century: by and large, scientific discourse would focus on the development of infrastructure in terms of technological progress while the humanities and the social sciences would plumb the depths of the “infernal wen,” “the city of dreadful night,” and the many other faces of the infernal metropolis.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither of these dominant discourses is precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span>, however; what I want to argue is that the specific constraints of their spatial representations militate against uncovering and articulating alternative spatial practices and possibilities buried within them in the same way that certain medieval crypts incorporate within their Christian depths the material traces of earlier, less orthodoxly religious structures. The conceptual spaces of the nineteenth century may not have found a visible place for them, but these buried pleasures nevertheless do begin to take form if we know where to look for them. And even though Victorianism as a discourse is heavily invested in constraining the scope and significance of individual pleasure and collective desire, there certainly were myriad, if often heavily diluted, forms of happiness to be found in the open air of the nineteenth-century city.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> But the forms of pleasure that interest me here, the ones whose power increases in inverse proportion to their visibility as such, are precisely those which are furthest removed from the conceptual space of open air Victorianism, the ones that suggest both the desires that were lacking if not actively being repressed and the ones that were made visible in new and perhaps unforeseen  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ways because of the new and unforeseen modes of being suggested by the technology and spatial practices of the modern city. In this essay, I approach these pleasures in two ways, both associated with the child: through representations of nineteenth-century children’s experiences of subterranean space and through a modernist search for pleasure within those nineteenth-century experiences, a pleasure doubly buried, in space and in time. I conclude by considering briefly what is at stake in interpreting these Victorian pleasures as they continue to manifest themselves in popular culture of the last couple of decades.

<p>
	There is only one readily available locus for representing unequivocally positive pleasure in the nineteenth-century underground: culture for children. Only in writing aimed at youthful readers are the wide-eyed wonders of technology and the unconflicted pleasures of subterranean Arcadia able to meet and perversely mingle. Thus, in Jules Verne’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Indes noires</span> , an exhausted coal mine can be transformed into a light-saturated, lake-side Coal City [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Badger’s safe and palatial burrow in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind and the Willows</span>  can reclaim and redeem the labyrinthine ruins of a derelict (and presumably Victorian) metropolis. In journalistic and sensationalistic writing about children, we find more grime but a residual insistence on the persistence of pleasure even within a sewage space that would destroy any adult foolhardy enough to venture into its depths. Hence, the gang of street children known as the Wild Boys of London can build a safe and dry clubhouse deep in the city sewers without emerging diseased or degenerated from contact with their subterranean environment. And Henry Mayhew’s Mud-lark can crack a mischievous smile as he rolls up his pants legs to wade deeper into the foul Thamesside muck in search of his daily bread [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Dickens captures both the allure of these images and the need to sublimate them in order to accede to adulthood in the autobiographically-based narrative trajectory of <span style="font-style:italic;">David Copperfield</span>. A favorite activity of young David during his tea break from work at Murdstone and Grinby’s warehouse is “wandering about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those dark arches.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>] Much later, as a young apprentice at Doctor’s Commons in Lincoln’s Inn Field, David measures the distance he has come in terms of that same space, now receded into the conventional underground of proper London: “I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	Seldom are built spaces created expressly for children, especially within an urban setting, but children, as the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre well knew, are eminently capable of appropriating space designed for more serious purposes. Lefebvre regarded childhood as a primary source for what he termed “lived space [ . . . ] where the ‘private’ realm asserts itself, albeit more or less vigorously, and always in a way against the public one,” the conceived spaces that dominate the spatial practice of any particular historical moment.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> There are, of course, fairgrounds, amusement parks, and zoological gardens, but the latter in particular is a case in point of the way in which a childhood pleasure—the unambivalent enjoyment of seeing and interacting with the natural world—is contained and conceptualized by a rational space. The compromised space of the zoological garden is evident in the “Full Moon” chapter of P. L. Travers’s Victorianist children’s novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Mary Poppins</span> , where Jane and Michael Banks, following their magical nanny to the London Zoo one night, are first terrified and then awed by the sublime world-turned-upside-down spectacle of freely roaming wild animals taunting caged humans. Even by day, and in a much less transgressive manner, the London Zoo did capture a child’s sense of space in the pair of tunnels linking its extension north of the Outer Circle to the main grounds; upper-class children must similarly have thrilled to the Nursery-maids’ Walk cut by John Nash under the New  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (now Marylebone) Road between the private green spaces of Park Crescent and Park Square just south of Regent’s Park. Dickens mirrored Nash’s child-friendly utility tunnel at Gadshill, the country house in Higham-by-Rochester, Kent, that he had admired as a child and purchased as an adult in 1856. A public road divided the brick mansion from a miniature Swiss chalet in the garden where he liked to write, so Dickens had a brick-lined tunnel excavated to join the two, through which he would journey every morning, a spatial threshold into the space where he would compose his late novels.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
	While any space can be appropriated in this manner into a source of childlike, if not childish, pleasure, underground spaces both urban and rural seem particularly amenable to the process. In rural spaces, they tend to merge with the arcadia and secret gardens Humphrey Carpenter identifies as the core image of what he calls the “golden age of children’s literature” from the mid-nineteenth century through to the First World War.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Carpenter is also quick to note that these occluded sites of childhood endlessly preserved from the pressures of modernity and adulthood were available primarily to children of middle class and affluent families, with the less well off left with “the pious trash that the Sunday Schools handed out as ‘reward books’.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> But doubtless these less privileged children would also have passively consumed the popular literature of urban mysteries, the city children at least, along with the myriad urban sensation scenes in the penny gaffs and East End theaters and transpontine theaters. These presented an urban underground far grittier and more violent than the arcadia of Kingsley, Mac- Donald, and Burnett, with less potential for positive pleasure and more potential for negative social truth. Fortunately there were the material spaces to compensate: riding the Tube, wandering through the Thames Tunnel, and exploring the Adelphi and the other dry arches that predominated in the poorer sections of the city whose inhabitants had not had the means to prevent the train embankments from cutting through their neighborhoods. All of these London spaces provided youthful urban dwellers with opportunities to appropriate the conceptually rational spaces of the new urban underground for their own pleasure and amusement.
      </p>
<p>
	Middle-class Cyril may be the one to step through the magic Regent’s Park arch into ancient Egypt in E. Nesbit’s fantasy novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Amulet</span> , but the “little ragged children playing Ring o’ Roses” around it have equal opportunity to view the moment of transgression.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> We have few traces of the child’s direct experience of underground London. What we do have are the arcadian otherworlds of authors pining for the subterranean virtues they can only imagine, or represent to themselves beyond the city limits and spaces of urban modernity. We have the technology eulogies of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boy’s Own Papers</span> which, like the Steam Man of nineteenth-century American pulp fiction, promise machine utopia shorn of the hints of destruction and overreaching that lurk around the edges of their adult versions. And we have the dour portraits and fictions of working children: toshers and mud-larks, crossing-sweeps and pickpockets, and flower- and watercress-girls. Emerging in the middle of the century, these are all partial representations of a single spatial practice, all simultaneously distorted and true. And all ask, I think, the same question, but in different ways: how do we recover the spaces of pleasure buried in our childhood when those same spaces have been paved  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> over by a technological modernity that threatens to negate the very phenomena that had caused those pleasures to begin with?
      </p>
<p>
	I should make it clear that I am not claiming the status of ontological truth for childhood pleasure; rather, I want to argue that it is through its burial in a represented space of childhood that those pleasures can be represented as such, just as their negation can be represented in the exploitation visible in the very streets and urban thresholds where they ought in fact to be occurring. They are, in other words, a roundabout mode of articulating dissatisfaction with modernity that the representational modes of modernity do not allow to be articulated directly. Certainly, much has been made by critics of the various forbidden desires the authors of the golden age of children’s literature were displacing onto the otherworlds of their fictions. Walter Benjamin has similarly alerted us to the imaginative and utopian value of the wilder dreams of the industrial age before its inventions were slotted into their proper place within the rational structure of capital. And the irrepressible suffering of resilient children laboring in the streets, while a potent image of the ills of capitalism, is simultaneously a potent image of the refusal of whatever desires we have invested in those images to fade away. That the Victorian era was the great era of repressed desire is a commonplace; that those very sites of repression have proven irresistible to later seekers of lost pleasure suggests that the act of hiding was also powerfully creative. The nineteenth century, as I have argued elsewhere, was the age when the underground, in addition to its function as waste depository and space of repression, was also, and uniquely, productive of new spatial practices.
      </p>
<p>
	It should not surprise us, then, that the four writers most responsible for Carpenter’s “secret garden” image were born within a decade of each other between 1849 and 1860 (Frances Hodgson Burnett in 1849, Edith Nesbit in 1858, Kenneth Grahame in 1859, J. M. Barrie in 1860), experiencing as children the precise years in which representations of urban modernity were taking a dark turn into the Babylonian.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> And perhaps it also should not surprise us, even if it may have disappointed Carpenter, that the next pantheon of children’s writers were born nearly as close together two generations later (A. A. Milne in 1882, Hugh Lofting in 1886, J. R. R. Tolkien in 1892, C. S. Lewis in 1898, P. L. Travers in 1899). Rather than lived as a child and processed as an adult, their nineteenth century would have belonged solely to the not-yet rationalized space of childhood, and their Victorian city filtered second-hand through the lives of their parents. We have tended to view the generational specificity of these writers exclusively in terms of the shock of the Great War at the moment they were coming into adulthood, but I want to argue that their unique spatial and temporal relationship to the nineteenth century marked their writing in an equally profound manner. I focus here on Hugh Lofting, as he is the only one of the four to signal his special investment in the nineteenth century through the Victorian timeframe he assigned to his signature character, John Dolittle, in the series of children’s novels bearing his name.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  The trench origins of the Doctor Dolittle stories is a commonplace of what little scholarship there is on Hugh Lofting, just as the trench experience has become a commonplace of the more substantial scholarship on J. R. R. Tolkien. And yet it is significant that none of the children’s writers of this generation either formally or thematically rejected the Victorianism that had led to the war to the extreme degree that their modernist contemporaries most certainly did.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The Australian dancer and actor P. L. Travers did not arrive in England until 1925, but Lofting, Tolkien, Milne, and Lewis all served in the trenches on the Western Front, and we find different echoes of this service in the subterranean spaces that punctuate their fictions. Milne’s Hundred-Acre Wood is certainly the most benign of these spaces and the most strongly and uncritically redolent of the pastoral otherworlds of Victorian children’s writing. Milne’s spaces are simple shelters, half animal burrow and half country dwellings; the only frightening space is the pit dug by Piglet and Pooh as a Heffalump trap, which comically traps them instead. Lewis retains the magical portal to Narnia in the dark back of the Victorian wardrobe, but the primary subterranean space of the series is the vast, evil, and enchanted land of Underworld that is the major setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Silver Chair</span>. Like Lewis’s Narnia books (published between 1950 and 1956), the spatial and thematic dynamics of Tolkien’s books of Middle Earth (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Hobbit</span>, 1937, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span>, 1954–55) are at least as heavily influenced by the Second as by the First World War. Nevertheless, the blasted spaces created by the misshapen orcs wherever they go powerfully resonate with the experience of the trenches.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Moreover, the way Tolkien constructed the thematic core of his books around different uses and abuses of the underground—the human inhabitants of Middle Earth are the only race that habitually dwells aboveground, and even so their most powerful and significant architectural accomplishments are seamed with subterranean constructions—places him in direct dialogue with the Victorian underground. Between the extremes of the village arcadia of the hobbit hole and the industrial catacombs of Sauron’s minions, we have a sustained meditation on the pleasures and desires of insularity. Tolkien plots the fortunes of war by the way in which subterranean spaces rapidly oscillate in their identity between pastoral pleasure and urban suffering, implicitly arguing that the Victorian separation between the two forms of space had become unstable if not downright untenable.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  Although he portrayed insularity as under siege by the forces of modernity, Tolkien appears never to have relinquished a belief in its superiority as a spatial practice. While the repeated quest structures fill the books with medievalist journeys through the underworld in search of knowledge and truth, those journeys (Bilbo meeting Gollum, Bilbo and the dwarves’ escape from the elves of Mirkwood, Gandalf in the Mines of Moria, Aragorn and his companions walking the Paths of the Dead, Frodo and Sam in Shelob’s lair and at Mount Doom, to name the most prominent) tend to be so traumatic that their retrospective necessity barely if at all mitigates the ordeal, and scars the participants for life. At the same time, the loss of mythically wondrous built spaces (the Lonely Mountain, the Mines of Moria, Erech and the paths of the dead, Minas Anor, Orthanc) to the forces of evil is nearly always predicated on a biblical sense of overreaching, either Babel-style to the skies or Satan-style to the depths. The simple, childlike pleasures of the rural undergrounds of the Shire hobbit holes—food, drink, companionship, and fireworks—hearken back to the Victorian, but whereas Grahame’s Badger could unproblematically re-appropriate the ruins of an ancient metropolis, Tolkien’s hobbits risk being fundamentally transformed by any direct contact with the urban underground.
	</p>
<p>
	  The underground dynamics of the early Victorian world of Lofting’s Doctor Dolittle series are quite different from those of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. All but one written between 1920 and 1933, the dozen volumes of the series are indelibly marked by their composition between the wars, from their inspiration, according to Lofting, in his sympathy over the unmitigated suffering of army horses at the Western Front, to their assault on the fundamental Western assumption of human superiority to animals.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> But the books are also the most explicitly indebted of any of the modernist children’s writers to the nineteenth century, not only as a source of critique, but as a site of buried pleasure and utopianism. The series’ temporal location in early Victorian England (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle</span> is explicitly set in 1839, and the series more generally located in the first half of the century) has not gone unobserved by critics. In his colonialist reading of the novels, David Steege notes how the temporal situation allows Lofting “to emphasize the best side of Britain’s interventions in African affairs,” in keeping with Dolittle’s paternalistic ameliorism and avoiding confrontation with early twentieth-century imperialism.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Elick views the historical setting as allowing Lofting “both a rosy lens for viewing the past and a platform from which to criticize the march of human history,” in particular, as she shows, the ways in which “eminent Victorian virtues [ . . . ] propelled English society into the Great War.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The plausibility of both explanations begins to suggest the extent of Lofting’s engagement with the Victorian; I want to add to the depth of that engagement by considering the specific nature of Lofting’s subterranean utopianism and the ways in which the early Victorian also offered him a portal further into the hidden past.
	</p>
<p>
	  Margaret Blount testifies to the originality of the series’ central conceit of human-animal communication “in human terms of words and grammar”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>; it becomes clear as the series progresses (the novels are linked or nested one within the other in such a way as to constitute a single massive <span style="font-style:italic;">roman-fleuve</span>) that Lofting views this discovery on a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> par with the contemporaneous inventions of paleontology and archaeology with which he frequently links Dolittle’s scientific endeavors, especially in Africa. The subtlety of Lofting’s achievement in these novels is not only to allow communication with animals that are, as Blount puts it, “not only much nicer than most people, [and] also more intelligent than many of them,” but, as Elick argues, to use a dialogic structure that gives these animals their own voice in such a way that their radical questioning at times even undercuts Dolittle’s more liberal vision of a benevolently human-centered world in which animals would be well treated.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Large portions of many of the novels are taken up by tales nested within tales told by various creatures to the Doctor, the members of his household, and various other animal communities. Moreover, as Schmidt has argued, the presence of Dolittle’s young apprentice, Thomas Stubbins, as either implicit or explicit narrator of nearly all of the books situates the novel’s subjectivity not in the fairly static and idealized character of the Doctor, but in a re that develops markedly as an individual over the years of the series’ publication.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> But Stubbins’s development is neither a maturation into adult middle-class values as in the Dickensian model nor the refusal to grow up characteristic of so much Victorian children’s literature; rather, he is the primary catalyst in the production of an alternative model of Victorian space that appears to be Lofting’s approximation of what would happen if the lived spaces of children and animals were allowed to develop into maturity unimpinged by the repressive structures of Victorianism.
	</p>
<p>
	  While Dolittle for the most part can be termed a holy fool in terms of money and convention, Stubbins is highly conscious of both but able to subordinate this consciousness in order to gratify his desire to wander, nurture the animal kingdom, and remain free. Gaining in ability as a mediator between the Doctor and the outside world, he promises to preserve the Doctor’s legacy into future generations. This is not to say that Stubbins’s existence is staid or banal: he travels around the world on a number of vessels, journeys beneath the sea inside a giant glass-shelled snail, and flies to the moon on the back of a lunar moth. His first task of major responsibility is the establishment of the Dolittle Zoo in the capacious gardens of the Doctor’s house in Puddleby-on-the- Marsh, for which he must both follow his mentor’s idea of a zoo and satisfy the animals’ own conceptions of one:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I felt very proud that the Doctor had intrusted such a large measure of the responsibility to me. [ . . . ] “Animal Town” or “Animal Clubland” is really what it should have been called, instead of a zoo. [ . . . ] But if it wasn’t a regular zoo to the ordinary public’s way of thinking, it was very certainly Doctor Dolittle’s idea of one. In his opinion, a zoo should be an animals’ home, not an animals’ prison. Every detail of our zoo [ . . . ] was worked out with this idea foremost in mind, that the animals should be made comfortable and happy. [ . . . ] There were certain rules, it is true, although the Doctor was not fond of rules, but they were all drawn up to protect the animals against one another, rather than to enslave or cut off their liberty in any way. For instance, any one wishing to give a party had to notify his next-door neighbor (they were very close, of course); and no tenant was allowed to sing comic songs after midnight.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  It should be observed that, for all of their good intentions, none of the Doctor’s schemes, including the zoo, endure for very long. This is one of the ways in which Lofting keeps his reader conscious of the frame of the world around the enclosed spaces in which the Doctor constantly retreats with his inner circle of animals and which, while not always invasive, always exerts pressure upon the fantastic spaces within. But, as above, Dolittle also never loses sight of the equal pressure of inevitable disharmony within nature. The dogs are unable to refrain from chasing and teasing the rats and mice; even on the moon, where the sole human inhabitant has cobbled together a pacifist and vegetarian community in apparently perfect harmony, we eventually learn that the cats as a group have opted out of the agreement, and live on the planet in uneasy isolation from the greater community.
	</p>
<p>
	  But it is the relationship between animals and humans that creates the most strife and yet also constitutes an inescapable reality within Dolittle’s utopian schemes. This is not only because of the benevolent necessity of Stubbins and Dolittle to ameliorate the situation of animals both in terms of their plight and in terms of their subordination to the human race. Dolittle first learns animal speech as the result of discovering that the real ailment suffered by a cart horse is nearsightedness: it needs glasses. There are strong resonances in this aspect of the books with nineteenth-century philanthropy, as when Jip the dog uses his share of the profits from the Dolittle circus to establish the East End Free Bone Counter for Indigent Dogs in a Whitechapel cellar.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> But Dolittle’s ideas also at times exceed those conventions: Jip is able to establish his Bone Counter because the Doctor has made his circus a profit-sharing cooperative among animal and human participants alike. In other episodes, he breaks into a London pet shop to liberate the poorly kept animals within, travels across England with a disguised seal he has set free from a circus, and books passage for several of his circus animals in a specially outfitted ship to return them to their homelands in Africa. Such excessive moments in the novels make it difficult to reduce them to an allegory of class relations, of race relations, or of childhood. However, at times, the animals are represented in terms associated with these three categories: the character and speech of Cheapside the London sparrow, who lives in a nest in St. Edmund’s left ear outside St. Paul’s, resonate with representations of the nineteenth-century poor; the long oral history of Chee Chee the monkey’s family and other episodes in the African parts of the series reflect conventional representations of indigenous communities; and Gub Gub the pig’s lack of self-control and fantasies of limitless consumption of food resemble typical representations of childish desires. The ways that Lofting’s narratives exceed those conventions provide an indirect critique of the limitations of those representations and also prevent his conception from being reduced to any of these discourses, even in the moments, as Steege details in terms of colonialism, when they touch most closely on them.
	</p>
<p>
	  To imagine a world of animals set magically apart from the world of men and women, as Milne does, for example, in the Pooh books, is to imagine a world reducible to the child’s space, and that consequently must be left behind when that child, inevitably, grows up. What Lofting does instead is to reimagine the world according to a child’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">experience</span> of space, partly because the child’s experience is the closest he can come to approximating an animal’s experience. He does this realistically enough that we must reckon with the consequences of the reimagining rather than dismissing them out of hand as fantasy. When the Rat and Mouse Club wishes to invite the Doctor and Stubbins to their Mooniversary dinner, Lofting is at pains both to represent a fittingly mouse-like space, “rather like a bee-hive [ . . . ] a sort of thick hollow dome, in the shell of which were the living rooms, furnished apartments, private dining-saloons, committee-rooms, etc.” and find a way to fit the human guests within that space: they get the badgers “to dig a tunnel down under the foundations” and into the Assembly Room “where there was just space enough for the two of us to stand upright, very close together.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>] Like the great Rat City carved beneath the ruins of a human town in the Volcano Rat’s tale (one of those recounted at the Mooniversary dinner), the Rat and Mouse Club at once resembles a human space in its organization and institutions and is alien to that space. The dialogic nature of the presentation of this Club, like the Home for Crossbred Dogs and the tales that emerge from its spaces, withholds judgment, allowing the reader either to smile or to admire, or both at once.
	</p>
<p>
	  The series is replete with such spaces, from the hidden clearing within the bird’s island off the West-African coast of Fantippo that becomes a safe meeting-place for all the world’s birds in <span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle’s Post Office</span> to the secret lake in the African interior where Mudface, the world’s oldest creature, lives on the ruins of an antediluvian metropolis (<span style="font-style:italic;">Post Office</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake</span>), to the library Stubbins excavates in the garden to house and preserve the Doctor’s massive collection of notebooks and leaves in charge of the mice (<span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle’s Return</span>), to the entire utopian space of the moon (<span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle in the Moon</span>). A number of these spaces are literally subterranean; others assume qualities associated with underground space by virtue of their occlusion from human sight and knowledge. There are also moments of conventionally Victorian subterranea, especially in the tale of Pippinella the Green Canary and star soprano of the Dolittle Opera, whose eventful life story reads like an urban mystery: she survives a revolution, works as a canary in a coal mine, and is adopted by an incognito duke who is writing a Chartist exposé on social injustice that a thief hides in a secret cellar beneath the abandoned windmill where the duke had lived before fleeing persecution by government agents. Rescued by the Doctor from a dirty petshop, Pippinella is a voice from a different, more conventional space, the Victorian diva of a serial publication apart from the Dolittle series.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> But elsewhere, Lofting appears determined to formulate a truly alternative space of pleasure and harmony out of the stark divisions of the Victorian underground.

<p>
	  Central to this alternative conception is a sense of children’s delight in the underground, and that child’s perspective is also what allows Lofting to evade the otherwise divisive conventions of the Victorianist underground. Whether strictly subterranean or not, Lofting’s alternative spaces are always otherworldly, but the way in which they are grounded in the reality of animal burrows, warrens, and tunnels prevents this otherworldly quality from being purely fantastic. Like the technological imaginations that spurred subterranean urbanism in speculative fiction of the second half of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> century, Lofting’s utopias are fanciful musings extrapolated from given data. Rather than projected forward into the future, however, they extend backwards into the dawn of civilization, a past that is simultaneously mythic in a religious sense and earnestly scientific in its anthropology. The ambivalence and contradictions that inevitably emerge from these representations, however, are not the unconscious blind spots that make subterranean urbanism so revealing (although Lofting certainly has such blind spots in the realm of colonialism in particular), but the conscious articulation of insoluble dilemmas that is characteristic of modernist fiction. Increasingly pessimistic about the capacity of the twentieth century to frame the questions he wanted to pose, Lofting found in the nineteenth century a moment and a mode of representation in which those questions could still be framed. And while it is not characteristic of modernism as conventionally considered to find such sources for pleasure within the generally repudiated spaces of the Victorian, it is a trait Lofting shares with a number of Continental writers of the same period, for whom the nineteenth-century city was a similar source to be mined for alternative visions of the contemporary world.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	    There is a modernist tradition of taking the child’s point of view as a critical perspective, and its theoretical underpinnings are based in its unique relationship to the nineteenth century. The principal proponent of this tradition was Walter Benjamin, and he meant it to provide the historical justification for the innovative cultural history he undertook in his Arcades Project, a study of the nineteenth-century urban culture in the ruins of which he considered his childhood to have taken place. Benjamin maintained his theory of modernity to be distinct from the typically modernist rejection of their parents’ generation—think Virginia Woolf’s parody of her father Leslie Stephen’s approach to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> as Mr. Ramsay’s obsession with getting past “Q” in the logically sequenced alphabet of knowledge. But Benjamin also differentiated himself from the tabula rasa approach of avant-garde movements such as the futurists and, especially, the surrealists, for whom, as for Benjamin, the buried traces of the nineteenth century were clues to the disastrous state of the present. The surrealists were invested in a buried nineteenth century that, located in the present, could point toward an alternate future, a modern mythology, as Louis Aragon put it. Benjamin shared the investment in an alternate future, as he shared the high modernist rejection of Victorianism and other nineteenth-century discourses of progress, rationalism, and imperialism; however, he believed the alternate future lay in an alternate past buried somewhere in the material and artistic culture of the nineteenth century more than in anything available in the present day.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Benjamin framed this belief under the rubric of the child, not as a subjective memory, but as an objective relationship to the past, “The fact that we were children during this time belongs together with its objective image. It had to be this way in order to produce this generation.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Writing of the repeated descriptions of interiors that haunt the writings of Franz Kafka (born in 1883, and thus nine years Benjamin’s senior): “And this experience remains an inalienable possession of his generation, his only—and therefore ours, because only for it do the horror-furniture of incipient high capitalism fill the scenes of its most luminous childhood experiences.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Because children experience space differently than when they become socialized into its conventional meanings, their representations and memories of it provide different information about it than adults’ more conventional experience of spaces. For Benjamin, those who were children around 1900 had no rational link to the nineteenth century, only a dreaming, childhood relationship, filtered, moreover, through the half-perceived traces of their parents’ childhood in the true Victorianism of the middle of the century—the inherited furniture and décor of the interiors; the musty books; the spatial conrations of family houses and apartments. This fragmented experience of the century was made all the more unique by its having been truncated by the First World War, which was seen to have  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sundered his generation from the certainties reflected in the accumulated generations of Victoriana. For previous generations, “To live in these interiors was to have woven a dense fabric about oneself, to have secluded oneself within a spider’s web, in whose toils world events hang loosely suspended like so many insects sucked dry. From this cavern, one does not like to stir.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Stirred by the war and then by the great migrations of the 1920s and 30s, which saw him first a voluntary and then an involuntary exile in Paris, Benjamin combed his childhood memories not for consolation, but for encoded answers and ways in which the present somehow could have turned out differently.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Rather than displacing and dismissing these memories into the fantasy spaces of children’s literature, Benjamin sought a way to use them as theoretical tools without thereby distorting their insights. The child’s city was prophetic, but only in retrospect, Benjamin argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood around 1900</span>, an autobiographical memoir that eschews the facts of autobiography in favor of a search for an historical truth available only in the unadulteratedly lived spaces of an urban childhood. Benjamin worked on this short book, which he considered an essential pendant to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcades Project</span>, throughout the 1930s, publishing twelve excerpts in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Frankfurter Zeitung</span> in 1935. (Reading these in exile, fellow Berlin native, exile, and exact contemporary Erich Auerbach in a letter to Benjamin praised “your ‘Childhood’ book, being of course the book of our own childhood as well.”)<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> In brief texts such as “The Sock,” Benjamin suggested the basis of the theory of dialectical images to be realized in the tissue of quotations, metaphors, and theoretical aphorisms of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcades Project</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The first cabinet that would yield whenever I wanted was the wardrobe. I had only to pull on the knob, and the door would click open and spring toward me. Among the nightshirts, aprons, and undershirts which were kept there in the back was the thing that turned the wardrobe into an adventure for me. I had to clear a way for myself to its farthest corner. There I would come upon my socks, which lay piled in traditional fashion - that is to say, rolled up and turned inside out. Every pair had the appearance of a little pocket. For me, nothing surpassed the pleasure of thrusting my hand as deeply as possible into its interior. I did not do this for the sake of the [ . . . ] warmth. It was the “little present” rolled up inside that I always held in my hand and that drew me into the depths. When I had closed my fist around it and, as far as I was able, made certain that I possessed the stretchable woolen mass, there began the second phase of the game, which brought with it the unveiling. For now I proceeded to unwrap “the present,” to tease it out of its woolen pocket. I drew it ever nearer to me, until something rather disconcerting would happen: I had brought out “the present,” but the “pocket” in which it had lain was no longer there. I could not repeat the experiment on this phenomenon often enough. It taught me that form and content, the veil and what is veiled, are the same. It led me to draw truth from works of literature as warily as the child’s hand retrieves the sock from “the pocket.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Rather than generating a modernist manifesto of the indissolubility of form and content within the present context of the 1930s, Benjamin discovers it buried deep in a nineteenth-century wardrobe, no doubt passed down through several generations of his Berlin family, an otherwise negligible detail of a typical upper-middle class childhood. The translation makes it difficult to grasp the degree to which Benjamin’s language  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> enacts the paradox of form and content his image wants to impart, but the lineaments of the episode stand out clearly. It is a sensual, if not sexual feeling of pleasure that sends the child’s hand into the drawers in search of the socks, but all of the pleasure is in the process, since the result is “something rather disconcerting”: the disappearance of the very object being manipulated. The same gesture enfolds the greater process of remembering that Benjamin wants to enact, and the methodological tightrope he would try to walk in the Arcades Project between material traces and theoretical mediation. It equally enfolds the re of the child itself, for whom the spectacle of the awesome spaces of the nineteenth-century city fails to hypnotize as it does the bourgeois spider in its web only because the child is too mimetic not to project itself into the inanimate objects around it.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The child, for Benjamin, is like the sock, back then still piled in pairs “in traditional fashion,” both containing and constituting the buried pleasure of that “present” he wishes to tease out of its woolen pocket. If, as I argued to begin this essay, the child’s space was the only one in which the occluded truths of nineteenth-century culture could appear in their full potential, then we can understand the allure of those spaces to a critic like Benjamin who saw them as his own birthright. And we can similarly understand the gesture of Lofting (six years Benjamin’s senior) or Tolkien (born the same year as Benjamin) in working through the trauma of the war and all the modernity that lay behind it by finding a way back through its break and into a buried past that might promise a path to a different present. To be sure, a quixotic endeavor, but, as Benjamin made clear, an endeavor uniquely full of objectively true meaning for the single generation that made it.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Doubly buried, both in their place <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the nineteenth century and in the past <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> the nineteenth century, these childish pleasures were dear to Benjamin or Lofting or Tolkien precisely because they were impermanent and imperiled. But how does the unique specificity of meaning claimed by these images for their writers coexist with the pull toward universality of the child’s love of dark, warm, hidden spaces? In the animal pleasures of Doctor Dolittle and the child’s epistemology of Benjamin’s theory of experience I think we are catching a last glimpse of a burgeoning modernity perceived personally—through the lived space of the child—rather than solely as representation, as modernism. For those who were children at its very end, the nineteenth century was still a great baggy monster, its exuberant richness and overwhelming plenty forming themselves in retrospect as the reverse image of everything the modernist would be: polished, precise, hermetic, and unitary. The resurgence since the 1970s of subterranean Victoriana within popular culture, especially in the many forms taken by steampunk in film, literature, and material culture, suggests dissatisfaction with the smoothly conceptual perfection of modernism as well as with the certainties of mainstream contemporary Victorianism. There is no space here to examine in detail steampunk’s perverse and playful trawl through the dusty corners and back alleys of the nineteenth century in order to generate alternative pasts and encase cutting-edge gadgets in the patina of outdated technology [<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 5 and 6</a>]. Freed of the weight of history that motivated Benjamin, Lofting, and other modernists, the ideological agenda of steampunk  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

In that, one could argue that it is true to the child’s space of the nineteenth century; however, this also should warn us that, in approaching the meaning of twentieth-century Victoriana either for the nineteenth century or for the present, we should draw truth from it “as warily as the child’s hand retrieves the sock from ‘the pocket,’” for fear of finding nothing there when we are finished.

		For an argument that Lofting’s oeuvre does indeed fit within the conventional rubric of modernist fiction, see Catherine Elick, “Anxieties of an Animal Rights Activist: The Pressures of Modernity in Hugh Lofting’s Doctor Dolittle Series,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Children’s Literature Association Quarterly</span> 32, no. 4 : 323–39. Elick bases her argument on chronology, on Lofting’s “radical, pacifist, and unconventional” protagonist , and on the paradigm shift from a human-centered world. In other words, she is arguing (and quite persuasively) for an expansion of the critical parameters of modernism rather than asserting Lofting’s place within the formal experimentation as which it is conventionally defined.

<p>
	  My epigraph, from a chapter in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Man without Qualities</span> titled “Cultural Revolution,” has an equivocal tone that would appear to be lacking in Ezra Pound’s exhortation “Make It New.” Of the three terms, <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> seems concrete and unambiguous. The verb is forceful (action verbs were an <span style="font-style:italic;">idée fixe</span> for Pound). But what is “it”? Squeezed between <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span>, those brawny avatars, it would be ludicrous to suppose some veiled reference to aura or star power of the sort that made flapper and film star Clara Bow the “‘It’ girl” on the strength of pulp novelist Elinor Glyn’s thesis in <span style="font-style:italic;">It</span> . One would more sensibly take <span style="font-style:italic;">it</span> to be an artwork, given Pound’s avocation. But considering the ubiquity of references to this famous phrase, it’s surprising to realize that <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> was not published until 1934, when Pound was immersed in politics and economics. In Canto LIII, he commemorated the Chinese emperor Tching Tang [Ch’êng T’ang], founder of the Shang Dynasty in the eighteenth century, who in Pound’s account “wrote MAKE IT NEW / on his bath tub / Day by day make it new.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this context, the <span style="font-style:italic;">it</span> in question concerns statecraft. Pound’s—or Tching Tang’s—adage has populated countless accounts of modernism, and it may be the most frequently repeated quip of the early twentieth century. It’s succinct, memorable, and relevant. But it’s also slightly anachronistic, for the steady drumbeat of The New preceded <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> by several decades—during which Pound himself  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contributed to the polyrhythm of its allure. With the migratory tenacity of a virus, this adjective fertilized the avant-garde wherever it landed. In what follows, I trace its persistence without being overly scrupulous in distinguishing one movement from another, for it seems to me there’s something to be learned from a signifier for difference that could be so widely adopted that the differences spread beyond distinction or accountability. It’s as if <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> was the very model of Gertrude Stein’s carafe or “blind glass” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span>, “a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Before reviewing the spectrum of exhortations, it’s best to set some outer limits (the <span style="font-style:italic;">inner</span> limits charted here date roughly from 1912 to 1934). In 1895, Paul Gauguin invited August Strindberg to write the preface for an exhibition catalogue. The Swede had keenly felt the power of Gauguin’s canvases (“I saw on the walls of your studio an uproar of sunlit pictures, which pursued me in my sleep”), and though he turned down the invitation, Strindberg conceded: “I am beginning to feel an immense need for becoming savage and creating a new world.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Two years later Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler, addressing “The Mission of the Artist,” concluded: “The work of art will reveal the perception of a new order in things.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Despite the burgeoning appearance of art nouveau, reference to the “new” as validation was not widespread at that point. Nearly fifty years later the exiled German Surrealist artist Wolfgang Paalen published “The New Image” in his magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">DYN</span> in 1942, in which he affirmed the definitive crossing over (as if on some aesthetic Aleutian Strait) of representational art into the domain of pure abstraction. For Hodler and Paalen alike, <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> was a term for the unforeseen—and even the unforeseeable.
	</p>
<p>
	  But what about the intervening decades? References were numerous, and not necessarily uncoordinated. The new generation was a predictable reference, but generations were a familiar way of specifying historical difference since Stendhal’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Rouge et le noir</span> if not earlier. <span style="font-style:italic;">This</span> difference, the <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> clearly underway by 1912, was felt to be decisive. The new spirit, the new form, the new reality, the new object, new facts, new organisms, new life, new values, a new world, new cosmos, new society, new culture or civilization, new era or epoch, new time and new age, to which the new consciousness and enhanced susceptibility would respond with a new sensitivity, a new corporeality, a new psychology aroused by new sensations; and these would give rise, naturally, to a new aesthetics, a new beauty—a new realism and a new archaism, enforced by a new rhythm—arising from new means and new methods: a new art, architecture, plastic expression, poetry, literature, new words and new language, music, drama, new optic realms, a new vision, a <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span>. . . . The alacrity required to dispel the old order was audacious and impulsive, but it could always be called New.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  William Carlos Williams observed, with obstetric care, the inaugural moment:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  They enter the new world naked,
	<br>
	  cold, uncertain of all
	<br>
	  save that they enter<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Williams’s medical expertise lends particular weight to his observational acuity, with the implied corollary that any historical nativity must also encounter its new world as cold naked fact: disarming, “the stark dignity of / entrance.” Hugo Ball experienced a comparable reverence for the surprising turn of events at Cabaret Voltaire in 1916: “There is a gnostic sect whose initiates were so stunned by the image of the <span style="font-style:italic;">childhood</span> of Jesus,” he wrote in his diary, “that they lay down in a cradle and let themselves be suckled by women and swaddled. The dadaists are similar babes-in-arms of a new age.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The following week Ball would intone the childlike syllables, “gadji beri bimba,” in a liturgical commemoration of this impromptu rejuvenation. When he carried the germ of dada from Zurich to Berlin, Richard Huelsenbeck likewise coupled apocalyptic rhetoric with natal deliverance: “The new man transforms the polyhysteria of the age into a genuine understanding of all things and a healthy sensuality.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> A cautionary respect for the paroxysmal delivery of a new order—exemplified by Williams and Ball—should be borne in mind when reviewing that euphoric insistence, <span style="font-style:italic;">make it new</span>, in any of its prodigious versions.
	</p>
<p>
	  Before the war, proclamations of the new proliferated promiscuously, but there were certain concentrated efforts to make it into the rallying cry for a cause. The Italian futurists, of course, were pioneers, as were the Russian futurists. German expressionist discourse was infused with apocalyptic acclamations of the new, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blue Rider</span> almanac was its most emphatic announcement. The Great War interrupted what was becoming a crescendo, but the very fact of the war—and the need to surmount whatever had given rise to it—lent renewed credence to the cause. A new order would have to succeed the atrocities, and during the 1920s De Stijl and the principles of constructivism reinforced this outlook. Although there could always be a tinge of it, <span style="font-style:italic;">novelty</span> was never really at the root of the new as a choral refrain. With nearly a century of commercial novelties standing between us and the modernist exhortation to Make It New, product endorsements and marketing strategies tend to infiltrate our historical hindsight. But commercial considerations were hardly the issue for the avant-garde, whose pronouncements were pledges of faith in the collective potential of new initiatives in the arts. These avowals tacitly shared the tautological conviction of Marijam Mikac in Serbia : “Zenitism is a new movement in the arts. As such, Zenitism is revolutionary.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Pound’s famous imperative may have been a late addition to the rhetorical arsenal, but it’s worth recalling that Pound’s own investment in artistic renaissance dates back to the initiating fervor of futurism. At that time Pound was a frequent contributor to <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>, edited by A. R. Orage, but the title is strictly symbolic, as <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> had little to do with the actual new age into which it fitfully persisted (“To this day I haven’t the faintest idea who <span style="font-style:italic;">read</span> that paper,” Pound recalled. “The only man I ever met who had seen my stuff in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Age</span> was an admiral”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a>). Nevertheless, it was in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> that Pound ventured his awareness of a characteristic preoccupation among his peers: “And the ‘new form.’ What is it?” he wondered. “It is not a mimicry of external life. It is energy cut into stone”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a>—a definition reflecting the monumental aspirations realized in Gaudier-Brzeska’s hieratic head of the poet. In this same year, 1915, the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Imagist Poets</span> appeared, to which Pound refused to contribute (wary of its democratic editorial procedure—but also because he had gone on to vorticism, that truculent amalgamation of futurism and cubism and, in a way, “a stricter form of Imagism”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a>). An unsigned Preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Imagist Poets</span> unreservedly adopts the pledge of the new: “To create new rhythms—as the expression of new moods—and not to copy old rhythms, which merely echo old moods,” because “In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Unbeknownst to the Imagists, the cubo-futurists in Moscow had already foresworn textbook metrics, declaring that “every motion generates for the poet a new free rhythm.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Among the signatories to this initiative were Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov and Alexsei Kruchenykh, whose poetic practices were far more radical than anything imagined elsewhere. Khlebnikov had already published his famous poem “Incantation by Laughter” in 1910, and Kruchenykh’s experiments in <span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span> or transrational language were underway by 1913. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Declaration of the Word As Such</span> , Kruchenykh insisted: “A new verbal form creates a new content, and not vice versa” (RF, 68). In another proclamation from the same year, he hammered the point home with added insistence: “Invent new native words! A new content <span style="font-style:italic;">becomes manifest only</span> when new expressive devices are achieved, a new form. Once there is a new form, a new content follows; form thus conditions content” . Not only was a new content at stake: “in order to depict the new—the future—one needs <span style="font-style:italic;">totally new words and a new way of combining them</span>” (RF, 72). This was a step beyond Mallarmé’s purification of the dialect of the tribe. Although neologism had always been a prerogative of poets and wits alike, it was indisputably new to claim as the poet’s special vocation a veritable replenishment of language from root to branch. Compared to the Russians, other exhortations to renew poetry could sound vague, if emphatic. “For a new world, new poetry,” Nicolas Beauduin urged in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vie des Lettres</span> in 1913.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Even Pound staked his claim on a hazy domain of “new emotions” alert to “new vibrations” as the poet’s prerogative.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> By the watershed year of 1913 the sense of an imminent new age was palpable: with utopian audacity, the cubo-futurists declared “We are the new people of a new life” (RF, 54). Inimitably put by Khlebnikov: “We rang for room service and the year 1913 answered: it gave Planet Earth a valiant new race of people, the heroic Futurians.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As with Italian futurist rhetoric, artistic license saturates these declamations, which may be construed as the artistic equivalent of pre-game warm-ups by athletes. The nature of the game was unclear, but it was hard to resist the siren call of modernity blaring from every city boulevard. Huntly Carter pondered the terminological equivocation in 1913:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    This Age, for instance, we regard as the Age of the New. But it is not to be confounded with the new age, which is quite another thing. Perhaps the latter is the one new thing under the sun. Unfortunately, we are unable to speak definitely on the subject, seeing that the term New Age is a dancing call to Utopia.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p>
	  Heeding that dancing call, most were impervious to Carter’s equivocation between the enticement of novelty and the dawn of a new age, for which Virginia Woolf famously posited a date: December 1910, marking the Grafton Gallery show of “Manet and the Post-Impressionists” in London (which fittingly opened on Guy Fawkes Day). This memorable occasion provoked much abuse in the press—“the pictures are evil,” “Van Gogh is the typical matoid and degenerate of the modern sociologist”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>—and even consternation among the intelligentsia (E. M. Forster, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">Howards End</span> had recently been published, was unsettled by the work on display). But as Arnold Bennett caustically observed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>, “The mild tragedy of the thing is that London is infinitely too self-complacent even to suspect that it is London and not the exhibition which is making itself ridiculous,” given that “the value of the best work of this new school is permanently and definitely settled—outside London.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Woolf’s canonical date, it turns out, attests mainly to a parochial panic in the world’s imperial capital.
	</p>
<p>
	  The Grafton Gallery event exposed Londoners to painting that had already long since provoked the innovations of cubism, expressionism, and futurism, examples of which did not reach England until the “Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition” in 1912, “Modern German Art” in 1913, and “Italian Futurist Painters” in 1914. Shortly thereafter, all such provocations would have the period feel of <span style="font-style:italic;">pre-war</span>. There has been no end of recalling the martial rhetoric of the futurists; but the genuinely <span style="font-style:italic;">apocalyptic</span> fervor was German. Consider the eschatological vocabulary to which Franz Marc resorted in the subscription prospectus for <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Blaue Reiter</span>: “We stand before the new pictures as in a dream and we hear the apocalyptic horsemen in the air. There is an artistic tension all over Europe. Everywhere new artists are greeting each other.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> “Today the new movement emerges from all quarters with fundamental power and unanimity,” wrote Marc in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pan</span>. “It is not a Parisian event, but a European movement.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Assimilating the Parisian vocabulary applied to the fauves, Marc characterized the primitivist urgency of his German colleagues:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    In this time of the great struggle for a new art we t like disorganized ‘savages’ against an old, established power. The battle seems to be unequal, but spiritual matters are never decided by numbers, only by the power of ideas. The dreaded weapons of the ‘savages’ are their <span style="font-style:italic;">new ideas</span>.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (BR, 61)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    What’s most arresting here is the almost imperceptible shift in focus from merely aesthetic adversaries to a less palpable, but no less imposing intransigence to which the artist has no alternative but to take up arms, making art a weapon. The inducement to artistic savagery finds its most urgent expression in Marc’s foreword to the never completed second volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Blaue Reiter</span>: “The world is giving birth to a new time; there is only one question: has the time now come to separate ourselves from the old world? Are we ready for the <span style="font-style:italic;">vita nuova</span>? This is the terrifying question of our age” (BR, 260).
	  </p>
<p>
	    The exhilarating burden of renewal was hardly exclusive to expressionism. “Since we have to <span style="font-style:italic;">re-create everything anew</span>, we Futurists are forced to make a far greater effort than any other revolutionaries who have appeared on the scene of Art,” wrote  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Boccioni.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Considering the exalted stakes, the rhetorical sallies of the Italian Futurists reveal in their unabashed bluster the need to work up the nerve and take the plunge into modernity. Furthermore, the futurist cause was agitated by visits to Paris, that capital of modernity; so when they spoke of “the exciting new psychology of night-life,” Boccioni could be confident that “Today modernity is using—in advertisements, newspapers, sketches and caricatures—a new kind of basic dynamic norm” (FM, 25, 153), affirming with Marinetti that “from the chaos of contradictory new sensibilities a new beauty is being born.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Man “multiplied by the machine” would achieve some “new mechanical sense, a fusion of instinct with the efficiency of motors” (FM, 97). Nicolas Beauduin, proponent of paroxysme, shared Marinetti’s prognosis: “the revelation of a new man, the machine man, the multiplied man, has appeared to us.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Paul Schmidt, writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span> in 1912, summarized a general consensus with this enthymeme: “The very fact that the new exists demonstrates its necessity” (GE, 14). Appraisals and specific applications emanated accordingly from different quarters. Luigi Russolo promoted his <span style="font-style:italic;">Art of Noises</span>  as a way to “enrich men with a new and unexpected sensual pleasure” (FM, 86). Architecture, the futurist Sant’Elia insisted, “must be new, just as our state of mind is new” (FM, 169). For Paul Scheerbart, it was specifically glass architecture that would give rise to a new environment, a new culture. “It is a joy to live in our times and whoever does not sense this cannot be helped,” declared Bruno Taut (GE, 124). Citing the rise of pictorial abstraction and the influence of architectural principles on the plastic arts, Taut promoted the Gothic cathedral as a model for the new synthesis, much as the Bauhaus would take its name from the Bauhütte, seasonal domiciles of cathedral builders. “There is a necessity implicit in this new art that requires the union of architecture, painting, and sculpture” (GE, 125).
	  </p>
<p>
	    Comparable attestations could be cited with exhausting redundancy. Even during the war, <span style="font-style:italic;">news</span> of the (prior) new fitfully persisted, blossoming with renewed vigor after the armistice. Consider the ongoing absorption of cubism, not to mention the trickle of impressionism into regional American art as late as the Thirties. Because such influences were rarely unilateral, involving not only temporal and geographical distance, but refractory forms of agency from publications to personal anecdotes, temporal priority in the domain of the avant-garde is misleading. Even so heralded a term as “futurism” precedes its indelible association with Russian and Italian proponents, having been coined by Majorcan writer Gabriel Alomar in 1904, a full five years before Marinetti’s inaugural manifesto.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In fact, two journals titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span> were published in Spain prior to the “founding” Italian event (launched in Paris in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>): one in Barcelona in 1907, another in Terrassa in 1908. However strident their declarations, vanguard movements could only precariously lay claim to the new; and while he approvingly anticipated his own obsolescence (“Quand nous aurons quarante ans, que de plus jeunes et plus vaillants que nous veuillent bien nous jeter au panier comme des manuscrits inutiles!”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a>), Marinetti bore the burden of his movement for the rest of his life—a sisyphean labor inflecting <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> with <span style="font-style:italic;">keep on trucking</span>. As Pound’s declaration suggested in its original Chinese context, the new was more likely to reflect individual rather than collective effort. Before the war, nothing exemplified  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this more readily than cubism, that non- or anti-movement that increasingly signified a threshold event. Before and after.
	  </p>
<p>
	    “It is my firm conviction that <span style="font-style:italic;">Picasso’s art must have as its consequence a new aesthetics and a new attitude to life</span>,” Max Raphael exclaimed in 1912.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Apollinaire raised the stakes a year later in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cubist Painters</span>, when he hailed Picasso as nothing less than “a new man, and the world is his way of representing it.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Picasso’s fellow pioneer, Georges Braque, concisely identified their legacy: “New means. New subjects.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The fruit of cubism was the creative restlessness expressed by Robert Delaunay: “I know all the old techniques. I want the new, the living, the unprecedented.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The unprecedented quickly reached flood levels everywhere, arriving at an exemplary limit in 1917 after “R. Mutt” (Marcel Duchamp, former cubist) submitted a urinal to a purportedly open exhibition of independent artists in New York, only to have it turned down. “Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance,” was Duchamp’s retort in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man.</span> “He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view—created a new thought for that object.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> The specificity of Duchamp’s formula—<span style="font-style:italic;">a new thought</span> for the object—anticipates a rhetorical shift that would accelerate after the war.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Before the war, proclamations of the new tended toward the generic, affirming the impact of modernity in everyday life while urging a corresponding transformation of art. Consider two such declarations from 1914, both by painters. Max Beckmann: “there is within me what I sense as new, new from this age and its spirit.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Fernand Léger: “A new criterion has appeared in response to a new state of things.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Equally open or vague exhortations persisted after the war, of course—“For a new world, a new art” (Cendrars)<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a>; “Art creates a new reality” (Janco)<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a>—but the stakes had changed. Years of senseless slaughter, combined with the political fluidity of revolutionary circumstances unfolding in Russia, Germany, and Hungary, suddenly endowed “the new” with concrete utopian content. “The recent war,” observed Juan Chabás y Martí in “Orientations to the Post-War,” “marks a new Era in humanity.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Marc’s pre-war evocation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">vita nuova</span>, terrifyingly latent as Yeats’s rough beast, suddenly acquired the capacity to impose actual tasks. Capturing the Bolshevik mood of Moscow in 1920 was the “Realistic Manifesto” of Naum Gabo and Anton Pevsner (shortly to decamp for the West): “The blossoming of a new culture and a new civilization,” they wrote, “have made us face the fact of new forms of life, already born and active.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even in London a comparable spirit could be felt. “We are the beginning of a new epoch,” Wyndham Lewis proclaimed in his journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tyro</span>, “fresh to it, the first babes of a new, and certainly a better, day.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Journals like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tyro</span> sprouted up all over Europe after the war, sharing the general platform of setting the arts to work on building the new world, convening the new order, welcoming the new epoch, establishing the new culture or civilization, and characterized above all by the “new yearning” expressed in the Ultra manifesto of January 1919 in Spain.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> From the opening salvoes of a few of these journals and allied organizations:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

			  The <span style="font-style:italic;">new life</span> was now unambiguously political. No longer confined to bohemian coteries or utopian communities, the whole fabric of human relations began to approximate the blank slate evoked by Malevich’s audacious claim, “I transformed myself in the zero of form and emerged from nothing to creation, that is to Suprematism, to the new realism in painting—to non-objective creation.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Realism for Malevich in 1915 meant embracing the new spirit with material resolve. “Our world of art has become new, non-objective, pure,” Malevich announced. “Objects have vanished like smoke, for the sake of the new culture of art.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> The confining reference to a new culture of art dates his proclamation as pre-Revolution (afterward, El Lissitzky could boldly declare: ”Now that we have mastered the plan and system of Suprematism, we will compose a new body for the earth, we will parade it all in such fashion that the sun itself will not recognize its travelling companion”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a>). But the sense of imminent consequence—the war as germination of a new order—was widespread. In Hungary, Lajos Kassák reflected: “It is as if the year 1914 had marked the onset of a new period in the evolution of humankind. The coming of a more human Human Being, inaugurating the age of a new moral order” (BW, 150). Five years later he adopted a no-nonsense imperative: “we need to build a new human being for a new society” (BW, 220). While such claims harbor the ominous prospect of applied social Darwinism, with the state as engineer of souls, in the avant-garde milieu of the 1920s they served primarily as a collectivizing aspiration for new art to serve as cleansing agent for a renewal of human potential.

			  When the cubo-futurists of Moscow declared themselves in 1913 to be “the new people of a new life,” they could hardly have foreseen how prescient their stance was. By 1918 Alexander Blok, by no means a futurist, could be moved by the Revolution to insist, “<span style="font-style:italic;">in the turmoil of the spiritual, political and social revolutions which have their causes in the cosmos, there takes place a transformation—the birth of the new man.</span>”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Bruno Jasienski, addressing his fellow Poles in “A Manifesto Concerning the Immediate Futurization of Life,” declared “We the Futurists are the first to extend our hands in a gesture of fraternity to the ‘new people’” (BW, 190). Ljubomir Micic urged a similar mission in Zagreb: “we want to emerge from ourselves with a New Man and shine a new light into the darkness of the black old days.” Compressed into a litany of exclamations: “New Man! New Spirit! New Art!” (BW, 293, 295). Prague theorists, eager to propagate their slogan, rendered the new man typographically emphatic: “The project of a new world can only be worked out by NEW MAN” (BW, 365). As Hungarian exile Endre Gáspár attested in <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span>, “Like their counterparts elsewhere, the Hungarians wanted to find a New Form for the New Human Being” (BW, 449). Ernó Kállai, also in exile in Berlin, regarded the “new man” as “no mere solitary rehead,” but “a manifold type differentiated into a thousand variants answering to the multitude of practical walks of life” (BW, 613).

			  As the cyborgian connotations of such rhetoric suggests, the new consciousness was predicated on prosthetic extensions of the sensory manifold.

Walter Benjamin thought that from film “there truly arises <span style="font-style:italic;">a new region of consciousness</span>”—a view shared by Spanish critic Ledesma Ramos, who proposed that cinema, being “the most inspired contribution to the new style of vitality,” stirred up new prospects for all the arts.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Guillermo de Torre concluded his 1925 study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Literaturas Europeas de Vanguardia</span>, with a paean to the cinematic infusion of avant-garde art in general, inspiring “new rhythms and a new expressive language” he called “lirico-fotogénico.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> These rhythms were the subject of cinematic investigations by Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter, who regarded film as “the new sphere of operation for creative artists” in general.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Eggeling’s designs for <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagonal Symphony</span>, widely featured in vanguard periodicals, served as visual icons of the new sensibility even for those who’d not seen the film.

			  These models confirm the orientation of Alexander Rodchenko, who said his unusual photographic angles were meant “to accustom people to seeing from new viewpoints.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Moholy-Nagy agreed that photography could be “one of the most important factors in the dawn of a new life.” His own career was a ceaseless elaboration of this fundamental observation: “The development of new technical means has resulted in the emergence of new fields of creativity.”<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Jan Tschichold, whose pioneering synthesis <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Typography</span>  had been instigated by meeting Moholy-Nagy and Lissitzky, was emphatic about his adjective: “Today the old and decadent, the young and vital, confront one another. The living man, if he does not side with the old and musty, can support only the new!”<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

			  To apprehend the new world, and make fruitful use of new media, the new man would necessarily undergo an aesthetic education so as to develop a new sensibility. This in itself was a striking divergence from earlier anxieties about the impact of industrial society on human nature.

			  of the perceptual apparatus had been widely theorized during the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> in sociological and medical terms, particularly in diagnoses of neurasthenia. “Our nerves are more sensitive to converging life forms,” Béla Balázs wrote as late as 1912. “This is the same new sensitivity that gave rise to Bergson’s philosophy” (BW, 151–152)—not to mention Simmel’s sociology, and even Freud’s psychoanalysis. Balázs would eventually embrace the cinema as “a new discovery, a new machine” that would “turn the attention of men back to a visual culture and give them new faces”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a>—while Mina Loy proposed such a program in her 1919 pamphlet <span style="font-style:italic;">Auto-Facial Construction</span>. Peculiar as they seem, these propositions by Balázs and Loy had a precedent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> supposition that the latest transport craze could brand users with “bicycle face.”<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> The futurist embrace of the dynamic metropolis made frequent reference to the need for physiological adaptation, and after the war Marinetti would extend this to tactilism— as did Viking Eggeling and Raoul Hausmann in their “Presentist Declaration”: “Now, it is for optics, haptics, etc., to take over, moving along new paths” (BW, 477). What had hitherto been consigned to the amorphous category of artistic genius was now given precise work to do in recently developed technologies. “Every piece of creative work actively observes new laws that expand the human organism’s functional scope” (BW, 478). The editors of the Rumanian journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Integral</span> enthused: “New psychophysiologies are growing” (BW, 554). André Breton, always in search of miracles but hesitant to associate the miraculous with modernity, conceded that radio transmission was “one of the very few specifically new determinations of our minds.”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> And out of these “determinations” emerged a new tempo. “A new rhythm is taking possession of the world, a new movement,” observed architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1923.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> “The art of today,” Henryk Berlewi reminded readers in 1924, “ought to offer a new language  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of forms, accessible to all, that would not lapse into conflict with the rhythm of our present day.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In 1925, pondering William Carlos Williams’s ability to “make a poem of a bare fact—just show you something he noticed,” Mina Loy emphasized: “That is the new rhythm,” the rhythm of the percipient glance.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Williams himself enthused about Marianne Moore, “This is new! The quality is not new, but the freedom is new, the unbridled leap.”<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In the uninhibited exclamation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Spring and All</span> : “THE WORLD IS NEW.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  In its generality, Williams’s enthusiasm elides the specification of commitments widespread in Europe. Polish futurist Anatol Stern, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Almanac of New Art</span> in 1921, encouraged the artistic pursuit of “sensations previously reserved for practical application.”<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> This “kinetic aesthetics” was indebted to the industrial art of film: “In the history of poetry the demarcation line is defined by the technological revolution, the history of the new poetry begins almost simultaneously with the history of film.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Cracow poet Julian Przybos thought that “The new poetry, modeling itself on the laws and methods of labor today, creates new forms of aesthetic production and striving”; and as he urged his peers, “The era of reinforced concrete is holding out its hands for your poems.”<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> It was a point of contention whether the poet needed to depict new technologies, or internalize them as structural principles. Vicente Huidobro thought that “If I sing about an airplane, with the aesthetics of Victor Hugo, I will sound as stale as he, and if I sing of love using a new aesthetic, I will sound and, indeed, be new.”<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> “New conditions of life germinate new forms of spiritual articulation,” wrote Hart Crane. “But to fool one’s self that definitions are being reached by merely referring frequently to skyscrapers, radio antennae, steam whistles, or other surface phenomena of our time is merely to paint a photograph.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> César Vallejo’s 1926 statement, “Poesia Nueva,” conceded the necessity of integrating new vocabulary, but added to the equation the prospect of new metaphors so as to circumvent mere “pedantería de novedad.”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> Metaphor would therefore be the privileged agent, revealing the simultaneous apparition of the new and the archaic. Celebrating the sculpture of Archipenko in 1921, Yvan Goll acclaimed “New Divinities! Is not the telegraph pole or the turbine the equivalent of the Tree of the Pantheists or the Bull of the Assyrians?”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> “Was it the new means of expression that determined the new aesthetic values?” asked Vinicio Paladini in a version of the chicken and egg enigma. “Or was the need to manifest such new aesthetic values—values that took shape in us through social, ethical, critical, or some other sort of influences—responsible for the discovery of those new means?”<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> There was a tendency to extend the concept of the beautiful to both prospects: to new means and to new subjects. Despite their shock tactics, the futurists had been willing to speak of a “new beauty” (FM, 154), and the claim persisted even in Constructivism: “The new beauty was born from constructive work, the basis of modern life,” wrote Karel Teige,<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> who like his colleague Jaroslav Seifert heralded “a new era. New beauty, new poetry of a new life, to which the art of the past has nothing to say” (BW, 383). “A new notion of beauty is born,” Henryk Stazewski exclaimed, “<span style="font-style:italic;">the beauty of utilitarianism</span>” (BW, 492); and, in the same issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blok</span>, Wladislaw Strzeminski defined the constructivist as one who “cleanses the technology of the remnants of traditional aesthetics and reveals the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> beauty of utilitarian objects—a new, universal type of beauty” (BW, 493). Extolling the virtues of modern art for merchandising strategies, Frederick Kiesler cautioned that “the new beauty must be based on EFFICIENCY and not on decorative cosmetics.”<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> Succinctly put by theatre director Meyerhold: “Today’s aesthetic must take account of the new standards which have been created by new social conditions.”<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> This was precisely the point made by Mayakovsky in 1913, whose futurist proclamation “We come with a new word in all fields of art” was tendered with this practical reminder: “nowadays the new can be not some object that is still unknown to everyone in our grey-haired world but a change in looking at relationships between objects that long ago altered their appearance under the influence of the great and really new life of the city.”<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> As Mondrian later pointed out, “the Place de l’Opéra in Paris gives a better image of the new life than many theories. Its rhythm of opposition, twice repeated in two directions, realizes a living equilibrium through the exactness of its execution.”<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  The new aesthetic could be taken as a fulcrum, reassigning to everyday life all the values (spiritual, sensory, cultural) previously affiliated with art. In the fourth thesis of the first De Stijl manifesto, “The new consciousness is ready to be realized in everything, including the everyday things of life.”<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a> Such an aspiration was shared among divergent constituencies of constructivism. Stephan Roll, whose father ran the café Enache Dinu in Bucharest—home to the Rumanian avant-garde—conceived a new model, “poet-<span style="font-style:italic;">sportsman.</span>”<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a> In Prague, Teige expanded on the principle: “If the new art, and that which we shall call <span style="font-style:italic;">poetism</span>, is an art of life, <span style="font-style:italic;">an art of living and enjoying</span>, it must become, eventually, a natural part of everyday life, as delightful and accessible as sport, love, wine, and all manner of other delectations.”<a name="f85-text" href="#f85"><sup>85</sup></a> In the same spirit, Theo van Doesburg and Cornelis van Eesteren asserted, in <span style="font-style:italic;">De Stijl</span>, “Today we can speak only of the constructors of the new life.”<a name="f86-text" href="#f86"><sup>86</sup></a> Looking back from the historical precipice of 1938, <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span> editor Herwarth Walden recognized that the postwar ethos was founded on the more generalized surge of prewar euphoria: “Why did the new art cause such a sensation before the world war? Because it <span style="font-style:italic;">stirred</span> the senses. Not because it created new forms, but because it expressed the new form of life” (GE, 321).
			</p>
<p>
			  A new hedonism was associated with novel forms of entertainment, like jazz (“evidence of a new vitality in music, a struggle after a form of expression, crude as the hieroglyphic of Cubism, but genuine art, nevertheless”<a name="f87-text" href="#f87"><sup>87</sup></a>); but at the same time the economic and political instability, along with the awesome transformation of Czarist Russia to the USSR, made statecraft conceptually proximate to craft in the artistic sense. What had been merely a descriptive or evocative term—as in Marc’s “The New Painting” in 1912 or Apollinaire’s “The New Spirit and the Poets” in 1917—became charged with potentiality. “We are launching a new art in a free and new country,” the Bucharest vanguard journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Punct</span> declared in the wake of the new Rumanian democratic constitution.<a name="f88-text" href="#f88"><sup>88</sup></a> Yvan Goll auspiciously greeted the dawn of the new era in 1918 with his book of poems <span style="font-style:italic;">Der neue Orpheus</span> (and, with the poems rewritten in French, not merely translated: <span style="font-style:italic;">Le nouvel Orphée</span> in 1923). Like Goll and other proponents of the avant-garde, Moholy-Nagy made a specialty of engaging the new point by point: “On the Problem of New Content and New Form” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Akasztott Ember,</span> 1922), “The New  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Typography” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar,</span> 1923), “New Form in Music: Potentialities of the Phonograph” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm,</span> 1923). His Bauhaus book, which had appeared in German under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Von Material zu Architektur</span> in 1929, was published in English as <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Vision</span> in 1932, and he continued to extol the new throughout the decade: “A New Instrument of Vision” and “New Film Experiments” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Korunk,</span> 1933), “A New Instrument of Vision” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Telehor,</span> 1936), and “Light: A New Medium of Expression” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Architectural Forum,</span> 1939).

<p>
			  During the 1920s, the period known in Germany for the new objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit), the new adorned countless book titles: from Bruno Taut’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Dwelling</span>  and Huntly Carter’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Theatre and Cinema of Soviet Russia</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit in the European Theatre, 1914–1924</span> , to Alain Locke’s anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Negro</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">New Mouth</span> by Tadeusz Peiper , <span style="font-style:italic;">Neue Gestaltung</span> by Mondrian , Le Corbusier’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards a New Architecture</span> (1927—the “new” being added for the English edition), Adolf Behne’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Dwelling—New Building</span> , Jan Tschichold’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Typography</span> , Werner Gräff’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Here Comes the New Photographer!</span>  and Huntly Carter, again, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit in the Russian Theatre 1917–1928</span> . Nor were such titles confined to the arts. Claude Bragdon in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Image</span>  extolled the virtues of androgyny; and his publisher found the time ripe to reprint Havelock Ellis’s 1890 book <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit</span> . Late in the day for its topic, it would seem, G. E. Newsom pondered even <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Morality</span> , a subject Pound had memorably visited long before in “The Encounter” (“All the while they were talking the new morality / Her eyes explored me”<a name="f89-text" href="#f89"><sup>89</sup></a>). Notably, and not surprisingly given the climate, “new” as a catchword acquired a distinctive political efficacy in the 1930s. In a sadly optimistic gesture, the surrealist enclave in Teneriffe issued a manifesto in 1933, identifying “the new spirit” with the international outlook that would soon meet its real adversaries in the Spanish Civil War. The progressivist <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> made an earlier debut before the Great War, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Democracy</span> by Walter Weyl , one of the founders of <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span> in 1914; President Woodrow Wilson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Freedom</span> in 1913; and playwright Percy MacKaye’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Citizenship: A Civic Ritual</span> performed in City College of New York Stadium on Independence Day, 1916. Walther Rathenau laid the groundwork for <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Society</span> in Germany , and Gabriel García Maroto anticipated <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spain 1930</span> . The decade of Roosevelt’s “New Deal” was populated by <span style="font-style:italic;">New Minds, New Men? The Emergence of the Soviet Citizen</span> by Thomas Woody , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Germany Desires Work and Peace</span> by newly appointed German Chancellor Adolf Hitler , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Capitalism</span> by James D. Mooney , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Democracy</span> by Harold Ickes , H. G. Wells’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New American, The New World</span> , Walter Lippmann’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Imperative</span> , and—showing the final stress points of international diplomacy—<span style="font-style:italic;">The New Propaganda</span> by Amber Blanco White  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New German Empire</span> by Franz Borkenau . Riding the rhetorical tide, Hitler gave an ominous twist in his 1937 speech opening the House of German Art (printed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Degenerate Art</span> exhibition catalogue). “Today the new age is shaping a new human type.” This type was on canonical display at the previous year’s Olympic games, declared the Führer, reproaching modern  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> artists <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>: “this human type, you gentlemen of the prehistoric, spluttering art brigade, is the type of the new age.”<a name="f90-text" href="#f90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  Despite cynical political appropriations, the decade of Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span>  did not go without further hopes for artistic renewal. Henry Cowell’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Musical Resources</span>  and Léon Moussinac’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Movement in the Theatre</span>  tended the flame, as did <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Architecture and the Bauhaus</span> by Walter Gropius  and, as late as 1939, Andreas Feininger’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Paths in Photography</span>. Composer Ernst Krenek scrutinized “New Humanity and Old Objectivity” for <span style="font-style:italic;">Neue Schweizer Rundschau</span> , Fernand Léger lectured at the Museum of Modern Art on “The New Realism” (published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Art Front</span>, 1935—and, in the same venue, “The New Realism Goes On” in 1937), Herbert Read proposed “A New Humanism” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Architectural Review,</span> 1935), and Carola Giedion-Welcker celebrated “New Roads in Modern Sculpture” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Transition,</span> 1935). In addition, there were informative compilations: <span style="font-style:italic;">The European Caravan: An Anthology of the New Spirit in European Literature</span> edited by Samuel Putnam and others  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Caravan</span> assembled by the sterling team of Alfred Kreymborg, Lewis Mumford and Paul Rosenfeld . Finally, instigated by Pound, James Laughlin inaugurated the annual <span style="font-style:italic;">New Directions in Prose and Poetry</span> (beginning in 1936 and lasting for fifty years) and, under the New Directions imprint, a decisive instigation in literary criticism was launched with several publications by Yvor Winters, given the inevitable moniker <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Criticism</span> by John Crowe Ransom in 1941.
			</p>
<p>
			  By the time Laughlin founded New Directions, ironically, it was getting a bit late to proclaim the new with the old confidence. There would always be <span style="font-style:italic;">news</span>, of course, bearing creative difference and deflection in its wake. Soon New York would be filling up with refugees, fertilizing avatars of surrealism and abstraction, opposing visions that in the American crucible ignited one of the more successful artistic phenomena of the twentieth century with abstract expressionism. In Europe, the choral momentum for making it new had served to advertise shared aspirations among members of the avant-garde, lending a strikingly cohesive aspect to manifesto rhetoric during the Twenties, reflecting either allegiance to communism or respect for the constructivist outlook broadcast from Russia. While there was considerable support among American artists for the Soviet cause, few of them could sustain expectations for a comparable revolution in the United States. Still, the American communist journal became <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Masses</span>, no longer the old huddled and yearning masses. After John Dos Passos and John Howard Lawson formed a group called New Playwrights, Lawson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Processional</span>  became a widely reviewed and successful pro-Marxist production, while Dos Passos’ growing skepticism about Communism was chronicled in <span style="font-style:italic;">U. S. A.</span> (1930– 1936). Possibly the socialist implications of the adjective in The New Deal were more worrisome to Roosevelt’s foes than the legislation itself. But “new” was a relatively neutral term, unlikely to absorb exclusively partisan implications (unlike, say, “red” during the HUAC hearings after World War II). In fact, the advertising slogan “new and improved” carried no such taint; and this provides another clue to the ascendancy of the new between the wars.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
			  As one of the headlines in Dos Passos’s “Newsreel” portfolios in <span style="font-style:italic;">U. S. A.</span> succinctly reports, “NEW METHODS OF SELLING SEEN.”<a name="f91-text" href="#f91"><sup>91</sup></a> American advertising culture underwent a dramatic shift in tactics, pitching the dream, the phantasm, rather than a wordy checklist of product credentials. “Advertising men were modernity’s ‘town criers’,” in Roland Marchand’s characterization. “Perceiving new vacuums of guidance and personal relationships,” the ad men “stepped forward to offer their products as answers to modern discontents. Thus what made advertising ‘modern’ was, ironically, the discovery by these ‘apostles of modernity’ of techniques for empathizing with the public’s imperfect acceptance of modernity.”<a name="f92-text" href="#f92"><sup>92</sup></a> By 1926 trade reviewers of the Art Directors’ Annual Exhibition of Advertising Art recognized the signature ad style of the day as indebted to modernism, including the use of diagonals, off-center graphic layout, unresolved pictorial tensions, and expressive distortion. Tactics refined at the Bauhaus and long since pervasive in Soviet design were being embraced by American advertising executives like Helen Woodward who, in <span style="font-style:italic;">It’s An Art</span>, hailed modernist design for its ability to “suggest novelty without the use of words.”<a name="f93-text" href="#f93"><sup>93</sup></a> The Museum of Modern Art went so far as to employ liaison personnel to help advertisers identify potential applications of its resources.
			</p>
<p>
			  A singularly informed, if little known, contribution to the merger of art and commerce was Frederick Kiesler’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and its Display</span> , with its distinctive dedication not to an individual but to the goal of “a sound cooperation between public, artist and industry.” In the prologue, Kiesler itemizes his reasons for writing the book:
			</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			    because the country has been flooded with examples of poor and distorted modernism because the sudden influence of contemporary art makes it necessary to control its real value
			  </p>
<p>
			    because the new beauty must be based on EFFICIENCY and not on decorative cosmetics<a name="f94-text" href="#f94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  Acknowledging that contemporary art had been thoroughly dismaying to the American public, Kiesler had the insight that it was precisely through commercial venues that modern art, as <span style="font-style:italic;">packaging and design</span>, would eventually infiltrate the American psyche.
			</p>
<p>
			  According to an industry observer, “Modernism offered the opportunity of expressing the inexpressible, of suggesting not so much a motor car as speed, not so much a gown as style, not so much a compact as beauty.”<a name="f95-text" href="#f95"><sup>95</sup></a> In this respect, the vanguard encomiums to the new society, the new world, and so forth were comparable pledges of faith in unsubstantiated desires. When Le Corbusier juxtaposed the image of an automobile with the Parthenon in <span style="font-style:italic;">L’Esprit nouveau</span>, the commercial potential of modernism was confirmed. The resuscitation of the cult of Nike, however, pinpoints the modernist commitment to <span style="font-style:italic;">make it new</span> as an Achilles heel—or so it has seemed to many commentators who deplore the absorption of modernist tendencies in art by commercial culture. There is ground for alarm, of course, when one contemplates characteristic constructivist designs becoming decorative motifs for crass products of late twentieth-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> capitalism; but the real thing, the original initiative, couldn’t survive even under communism. So the persistence of these flickering design logos from the aftermath of the October Revolution have attained a utopian afterlife, signifying <span style="font-style:italic;">the good life</span> for those with sufficient educational background to know what <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> good life was (or might have been) all about. It’s also worth recalling that the most securely canonized of modernist authors made his modern Ulysses an ad man. And what could be more <span style="font-style:italic;">a propos</span> than Leopold Bloom’s encounter with the Cyclops (a.k.a. Citizen) in a Dublin pub: “Because you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That’s the whole secret.”<a name="f96-text" href="#f96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  By the end of the Thirties, the rhetoric of the new in artistic circles had acquired a paradoxically dated aura, much the way the term “modern” had lost its edge a century after Baudelaire’s worried appraisal of an art with one foot in eternity and the other in the gutter. Baudelaire’s unique contribution to the emergence of modernism as new, as <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span>, endorsed improbable alliances between novelty and durability, dignity and buffoonery, triviality and wisdom. It was a course that prompted Hugo Ball to consider, in the midst of the great flourish of Cabaret Voltaire in 1916, “There is a danger that only our mistakes are new.”<a name="f97-text" href="#f97"><sup>97</sup></a> That Jean Epstein could put a positive spin on it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonjour Cinema</span> in 1921—“We are different . . . we need to make new mistakes”<a name="f98-text" href="#f98"><sup>98</sup></a>—only heightens the sting. Make it new, then, could also mean make new mistakes. And, with another twist by way of Victor Shklovsky, making it new could also mean: make it strange. Hugo Ball surmised as much, writing in his diary, in a passage that modestly yet immoderately sums up its era: “The distancing device is the staff of life. Let us be thoroughly new and inventive. Let us rewrite life every day.”<a name="f99-text" href="#f99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  Pound’s slogan has had such preponderant influence—his imperative is hard to resist, after all—that it can hardly be consigned to the historical past. Its insistence presses forward, inexorably. So it’s fitting that a <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> response from the choir unabashedly proclaimed, in the master’s voice, “the new sentence.”<a name="f100-text" href="#f100"><sup>100</sup></a> The advocate was Ron Silliman, self-elected custodian in the Poundian lineage; and his promotion of a compositional strategy he provided models for in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ketjak</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tjanting—</span>accompanied by what’s been the more widely embraced <span style="font-style:italic;">My Life</span> by Lyn Hejinian—played a decisive role in establishing “language poetry” as a singular phenomenon in the waning galaxy of the avant-garde at century’s end. As terms like <span style="font-style:italic;">modern</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">postmodern</span> cracked skulls in the empire of Godot, the real locomotion continued to be powered by the simplest and most irresistible of adjectives.

Kurt Heinzelman emphasizes the role of cultural transmission—always important to Pound—in the patrimony of the phrase: “Pound’s phrase MAKE IT NEW is not merely a mistranslation but a kind of cultural sounding: it is a translation (from French) of a translation (from Manchuan or Mongolian Chinese) of a translation (from twelfth-century neo-Confucian Chinese) of a text of greater antiquity than the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible. So, what is ‘new’ has here passed through four excavations, traversing nearly four  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> millennia.” As Heinzelman adds, “the apotheosis of translation into the vehicle for disclosing what remains new about antiquity is one of Pound’s most luminous claims” (“‘Make It New’: The Rise of an Idea,” in Kurt Heinzelman, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New: The Rise of Modernism</span> [Austin, TX: Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, 2003], 132).

Ricciotto Canudo, who would later become one of the early theorists of cinema, envisioned a new religion based on a “new Pathos which is destined to vivify the arts of the twentieth century . . . the Pathos of Plenitude” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Music as a Religion of the Future,</span> trans. Barnett D. Conlan [Edinburgh: T. N. Foulis, 1913], 40). The Nietzschean basis of Canudo’s outlook is shared by James Huneker, who quoted the philosopher in his epigraph to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pathos of Distance</span>: “New ears for new music . . . New eyes for the most remote things . . . The pathos of distance” (Huneker’s ellipses: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pathos of Distance</span> [New York: Scribner’s, 1913]).

<p>
	I was told what happened this spring at one of the Moscow exhibitions. In a secluded room, a young woman started crying hysterically in front of a painting depicting a beautiful island in the middle of calm seas, a haven of love and beauty. Surprising and terrible were those real tears in front of a golden-framed painting which had nothing upsetting in itself. The organiser of the exhibition, K., a nice and friendly person, tried to calm the young lady. She kept repeating through tears: “Blood, blood, blood everywhere... <span style="font-style:italic;">but here</span> it feels so good.” Then the reason for her weakness became understandable. She had been to Poland, had seen a lot, had read the newspapers daily but precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">here</span>, in front of a painting, the thought of the inadequacy between the “blood” and the most cherished human dreams struck her with a particular violence. Undeniably, at this very moment, the colour-covered canvas in a golden frame won a great victory!
      </p>
<p>
	People might say: the young woman was naïve and sentimental. But doesn’t truth disclose itself to children, didn’t a child denounce the lies of the king in Andersen’s story? The young woman was moved by the genuine mission of art: a plea for human and humanist beauty, for the azure kingdom, for the kingdom of God. Of course art ceases to be art when it preaches  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this plea; but it achieves its highest vocation when its unknown energies succeed to inspire will for life, faith in life. Nothing is hideous to such art, religious in its very nature; it unveils the wonderfully human in the typically human. Nothing is inanimate to such art; it perceives a soul in every “dead” thing.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet how far is this kind of art from the present-day futurism with its cult of the painterly <span style="font-style:italic;">bric-à-brac</span>* and its “ferro-concrete” poems!
      </p>
<p>
	There was a time, at the beginning of the war, when it seemed that a return to futurism was not possible, that it had dissipated as a bad dream. For the everyday reality with its death-propelling airplanes, its floating mines, its far-firing monsters, and its suffocating gases turned out to be more “futurist” than anything Marinetti’s most frenzied and militant fantasies could have dreamt of when he was glorifying war as the “world’s only hygiene.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Moreover, the very destruction of the monuments of the old art, to which the first futurist manifesto was appealing with the hotheadedness of the youth, did not only became a military event but even found a particular kind of ideological defence on the side of the most zealous and old-fashioned explorers of the past, the German <span style="font-style:italic;">Gelehrters</span>.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the face of the sorrowful ruins of the Reims cathedral, this first embodiment of a futurist act, this triumph of technology, yesterday’s verbal and artistic futurism seemed like childish stammering or, on the contrary, like worn-out “passéism.” Indeed, how could Marinetti’s “telegraphic lyricism” and battle onomatopoeias or Kamensky’s ferro-concrete poems compete with the genuine ferroconcrete poem of the most recent war?
      </p>
<p>
	It seemed that the time had come for a change of minds, that the roar of the military events would deafen the militant verbosity of our youth. For it could now have a glimpse at the “future” it was dreaming about: a future of bare physical strength and deified, soulless machine, a future of lightning-quick and ubiquitous speed... It seemed that our youth, saddened and ashamed, would come back to what it was burning before—the human being [<span style="font-style:italic;">čelovek</span>]—, to its eternal ideal—a beautiful soul and a beautiful body; that the “blood” spilled over “there” would not have been worthless but expiatory and purificatory blood; that the military thunder, calming down after the destruction, would give birth to a new conscience. For war is often part of the force that creates good while wishing the evil...
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>
	Yet—alas!—everything remained the same. The Burliuk and the Mayakovsky have clung to their positions; Larionov went to the front and came back unchanged. The exhibition “The Year 1915” arranged by Kandaurov in the Moscow Art Salon with the interesting aim to provide an objective image of contemporary painting, became a true bacchanalia of every variety of futurism. Actually, there were also some other trends at the exhibition. The works by the members of the “Knave of Diamonds” group seem already quite insipid next to all that ensued: Konchalovsky’s huge carpet project, Mashkov’s colourful, juicy fruits, Falk’s intimate landscapes and Kuprin’s pretty stilllives. Altman, Mrs. Tolstaia, Latri, Obolenskaia, Khodasevich, and especially the young  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> painter from Vitebsk, Mark Chagall—they all have some good things. But all this is deafened by the yelling actions of the futurists that weaken the beholder’s ability to perceive anything else.
      </p>
<p>
	Until now we were acquainted with “cubism” and “futurism” as a particular system of treating lines and colours on canvas. We were acquainted with Kandinsky’s “musical painting” which sought to arouse in the viewer this or that musical sensation by ways of mere coloured arabesques; this attempt was at least theoretically grounded. We had seen pasted paper labels on canvas as well as mosaics of gaudy coloured bits of fabric (“simultanism”) and it seemed that the laughster-artists<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> had little to surprise us with.
      </p>
<p>
	But this time the Muscovites did not stick to pasting. Larionov judged that it was insufficient, too unambiguous and elementary to paste scraps from theatrical posters on the portrait of Natalia Goncharova, reminding the audience of her participation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coq d’or*</span> and in “The Fan.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> He decided that he <span style="font-style:italic;">could do without the canvas</span> and show the audience some real things, joyfully coloured or even in their natural state. Hence, on his other, paper-made “portrait” of Goncharova, he pasted a real hairdresser’s plait. He then “nailed” some sticks, frames, a hat box, a bottle, bits of spiral-twisted paper, military maps, and newspaper clippings to the wall, painted all this with a brush, and achieved a “plastic rayism,” i.e. emanation of rays and mutual penetration of one object into another. In order to represent an “iron battle,” he took a board, pasted onto it pieces of military maps, candy wrappers and national toy-flags, added a toy house in place of a fortress and some black sticks symbolising cannons, and traced some bloody rivers and mountains in the form of red layers. The result is a “military toy” that any child would make in a much better way, for in the name of the decorative side of the war it would forget about its blood...
      </p>
<p>
	Mayakovsky acted even more simply: he displayed half of his top hat, his black glove, sprayed some black stripes on the wall and called all this a “sole-portrait” [<span style="font-style:italic;">samo-portret</span>]. The work of Tatlin, however—a very talented artist who gave us over the last year some interesting sketches for the performance of “Life for the Tsar”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>—his work is no longer a <span style="font-style:italic;">bric-à-brac*</span> hastily nailed to the wall and coloured in the very exhibition space. It is a thorough device [<span style="font-style:italic;">sooruženie</span>] that he toiled to “nail” together: a folded iron sheet and half of a glass jar on a [wooden] board coated with plaster—a combination of black, grey, and dirty white shades and “intersecting planes.” Another “plastic still-life” consists of the same board, a chair leg and an S-shaped piece of iron. One ought to observe this junk from a single viewpoint; therefore, the author has drawn on the exhibition floor a sign indicating the place where the beholder should stand. While one might laugh at Larionov’s gaudy-coloured jumble, Tatlin’s austere black-grey-and-white showcase of things does not convey a laugh: too much work has been spent on it! <span style="font-style:italic;">“He nailed the temples with a rusty great.</span>”
      </p>
<p>
	This replacement of the painted still-life with real dead things is, actually, a very logical conclusion to “cubism.” This is cubism brought to its extreme limit, to its absurd. Why represent the volumes of things and the depth of space when one can simply display them by handing over an actual jar and by folding a tinplate sheet in order to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> get the third dimension? Why compose on the palette the different shades of iron, lime, and glass, when one can find them in real iron, plaster and jar?

<p>
	There was a grain of truth in cubism but it was cultured in a totally erroneous way. I mean the ambition to consolidate form and to facet objects, which came as a legitimate reaction against the amorphous and pulverized painting of the impressionists. Cézanne countered Manet’s [sic] de-objectified pictorial mirages with his consolidated—as if cast from rigid mass—res. What guided the brush of Cézanne was not merely the optical irritation of the eye (as in the paintings of the impressionists) but its sensory and motor capacity as well. This two-folded perception of the world, both pictorial and plastic [<span style="font-style:italic;">plastičeskoe</span>], bore in itself a great and healing principle. It returned to painting the <span style="font-style:italic;">feeling of reality</span> that the impressionists had lost; it announced a genuine, organic artistic synthesis—a painting in which the colour and form of things would harmoniously balance each other. Such a painting would be the triumph of the genuinely Latin tradition, the tradition of Poussin, classical in its nature, for classicism is balance and harmony.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet as always, the epigones vulgarised and perverted the idea of their teacher. Cézanne’s words that <span style="font-style:italic;">nature</span> should be rendered through the shapes of sphere, cone, and cylinder led them to the conclusion that one ought to paint only geometrical bodies. Cézanne’s “curvature,” which, as he complained to Bernard, was a flaw of his ageing eye,<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> but which did not prevent his compositions from being solidly built, led them to the conclusion that one ought to displace and curve the lines of all objects. Hence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> appeared the popular theory of “displacement,” of the “penetration” of objects one into another, of the “plastic dynamism”—a theory of the very illusionist impressionism that Cézanne had risen up against. For Cézanne, as a classic, was grounded in the objective idea of an object, in the representation of its volume, and not in this or that impression [of the object], while the “displacement” gives way, indeed, to the subjective arbitrariness of any given painter. Anyone would displace and dismantle objects anyhow! As a result, instead of Cézanne’s solid and monumental world, we’ve attained a new dematerialisation of the world, a new de-objectification of the things. The facets of the plane and the corners have grown into fetishes. In the name of geometry we have forgotten the blood and flesh of Cézanne’s painting—its saturated, resonant and replenishing colour. The paint was replaced by wallpaper and pasted papers. But it was even more consistent to replace the painted cylinders by a glass jar. Cézanne was yearning for the solidity of things—what could be more solid than the thing itself, real iron and glass?

<p>
	This is the logic of madness . . .
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>
	I already mentioned that the paintings of the “Knave of Diamonds” seem “insipid” today. Yet not so long ago even Konchalovsky’s Van Gogh-influenced paintings seemed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> revolutionary. There was a time when the Sunday visitors to the Shchukin gallery laughed upon Gauguin, while today Gauguin seems to them so undeniable and classical that, without even a halt in front of his wall, they move on to laugh upon Picasso. Shouldn’t we conclude that the works of the “nailers” would appear quite acceptable in a couple of years, just like all those other painterly phenomena that first gave rise to a storm of jokes and complaints? For even if the patriarch of Impressionism Edouard Manet had stated in the manifesto-introduction to his catalogue that he “never wanted to protest,” that he “merely sought to be sincere,”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> we might admit that a certain mood of struggle and protestation as well as a deliberate desire to <span style="font-style:italic;">épater les bourgeois*</span> are inevitable, from a psychological point of view, when a new tendency is about to clear its way. The radicalism of the new that such a tendency brings about is inevitable. Going too far is inevitable. Life has become so complex, there is such an over-production in art that it is difficult to ask modern artists to be as heroically modest as in the good old times. I fully understand the muddled cautiousness of the contemporary beholder who, on the one hand, is anxious not to miss something new and valuable while, on the other hand, fears to look like the fooled subjects of Andersen’s king. The situation is indeed tragicomic.
      </p>
<p>
	But it shouldn’t deprive us of our freedom of judgment nor turn us into “lackeys of the lackey-less.” As Baudelaire said, if “everything beautiful is strange, everything strange is not beautiful.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> For the question is not whether to “drag and not let”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> the new tendency, stab or not stab its samples with a cane, as the Parisian audience had wished at the sight of Manet’s paintings at the Salon des Refusés. No one contests nowadays the freedom of the artist, or the fact that futurism reflects the modern “whirl of ideas” and, as such, is fully understandable from a sociological point of view. The discussion is rather whether <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> manifestation of the artistic arbitrariness is—or not—worthwhile; whether is or not worthwhile the futurist <span style="font-style:italic;">adoration</span> of those sides of contemporary life that our general cultural conscience wishes to overcome.
      </p>
<p>
	We do not argue over the fact that Tatlin is an able man who has spent a lot of labour in “nailing” his iron-glass work, but contrary to Apollinaire’s statement that “one should judge the work of art upon the quantity of labour supplied in it”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> we believe that the work of art should be judged solely upon its final result.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> And since a combination of iron, glass, and plaster does not evoke in us <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> human emotion, then the result is un-artistic. Tatlin has fully the right to study the correlation between plaster, glass and tin within his studio, during the creative process; but at the exhibition we are only interested in the creation.
      </p>
<p>
	Similarly, we do not contest the fact that Kamensky’s ferro-concrete poem ([published in] “The Archer”) records his impressions from Constantinople, as such chaotic, scarce, and fugitive impressions and associations come to the mind of every city-dweller when he absorbs the polyphonic diversity of the street; already the Goncourt brothers had taken note of the impressions invading the soul of Cariolis [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] during his trip in the omnibus (<span style="font-style:italic;">Manette Salomon</span>*). But we do have the right to say that this is not a poem but a simple diary, and for that reason its place is not next to real poetry and prose. Moreover, it is thoroughly inappropriate for anyone to read Kamensky’s pocket  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> diary—its entries are too intimate and arbitrary. Why should we care, indeed, about the association that came to Kamensky’s mind at the sight of the mullahs, and how would we guess that the corals are the talisman of the poet who, according to the kind explanation of his commentator Mr. Shemshurin, “believes in such devices.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> By the way, Shemshurin himself was granted to learn these confidential secrets only “thanks to chance.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
	According to Mr. Shemshurin, Kamensky “acts just like Pushkin did” when instead of describing the winter he simply wrote “Winter! The peasant, celebrating...,”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> etc. But Shemshurin is seriously mistaken. Pushkin was much more <span style="font-style:italic;">modest</span> than Kamensky. Pushkin’s “Winter” is an objective image [<span style="font-style:italic;">obraz</span>] that evokes in us a series of shared and necessary associations, while the alphabetic and numeric drawings in Kamensky’s poem are totally random and arbitrary images. Anyone can associate anything with letters and ciphers! This is no longer the “forest of symbols” from Baudelaire’s dream but the impenetrable woodland of allegories. This is no longer the “gradual deciphering of hints” on which rely Mallarmé’s dark sonnets, but an encrypted stenography with no key available. For the key is only in Kamensky’s pocket, and any search for this key would entail digging in a stranger’s pocket.
      </p>
<p>
	Egotism, this infinite absorption in one’s petty self [<span style="font-style:italic;">samovliublennost’</span>]—such is the heavy sin of our artistic youth. Kamensky is convinced that his Constantinopolitan half-sensations have universal human value. Larionov illustrates Goncharova’s portrait with more or less promotional newspaper clippings speaking about her victories, about her ubiquitous “screenniness.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Mayakovsky’s act is even simpler: he displays <span style="font-style:italic;">orbi et urbi*</span> bits of his wardrobe, a top hat and a glove, as “sole-portrait” [<span style="font-style:italic;">samo-portretnye</span>] values, just as in his “poem” he calls himself “a cloud in trousers.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Indeed, contemporary futurists have top hats, gloves and trousers but their soul has evaporated like a cloud.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">V</h1>
<p>
	This petty egotism and evaporation of the soul are not only our youth’s fault but also its tragedy, maddened as it is by the chaos of the metropolis. If some ultra-orthodox historical materialist were to invent the art that would best correspond to the city’s [way of] “being” [<span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span>], he wouldn’t find any better choice than to invent the futurist “conscience.” It’s true, however, that two conflicting tendencies coexist in the complex, fleeting and lightning-quick life of the city. The first one subjugates the human soul through the glittering dynamism of the street, devastates it as if it was wine that had been going through too many barrels, and turns the human being into a passer-by in life who abides by the <span style="font-style:italic;">credo: homo homini lupus est*</span>. This psychology of every individual passer-by in life leads to the fetishism of chaos and dynamics, to futurist anarchism, and to petty-bourgeois egotism.
      </p>
<p>
	The man of the crowd encrypts his feelings—what does he care if another passer-by will understand them! The man in a derby hat only wears a top hat in order to stand out of the derby crowd, out of the common street “dynamism.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	This is why Lentulov can write publicly, on a painting of his covered with pasted gold stars:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  “This manner of decorating one’s works belongs only to me; any untalented imitation would be subject to cruel prosecution.”
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Let it be a joke, but this joke is highly symbolic: it says everything!
      </p>
<p>
	It is fully understandable, from a psychological point of view, why for the individual passer-by who clings to his distinctiveness<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> as to a private property, the painting shouldn’t be part of a decorative whole but a self-sufficient entity; and why it “can be transferred with no consequences from the church to the dining room, from the museum to the dwelling” (Kul’bin<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>). For such a painter totally lacks any feeling of monumentality, any feeling of the indivisible bond between painting and wall. His ideal is no longer the fresco but the self-sufficient study or the personal diary poem <span style="font-style:italic;">an und für sich*</span>. This has always been the case in the eras of individualism, when the feeling of the organic character of life was being lost: the Alexandrian era produced a new, “cabinet” form of bas-relief, the genre medallions, easy-to-carry sculpture that could become a petty-bourgeois “lovely setting.” Such was the result of the incursion of urban “dynamism” into Ancient life.
      </p>
<p>
	But there is another tendency in the city: it makes the human soul more ample, responsive, and understanding; it leads to the feeling of a universal solidarity, to the <span style="font-style:italic;">unanimisme*</span> which the French poet Jules Roman [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] laid at the basis of his poetry of the crowd; to the <span style="font-style:italic;">altruisme</span>* of the scientific poetry of René Ghil, to the socialism of the greatest city-dweller of our days—Verhaeren. More than anyone else, Émile Verhaeren feels the great dynamism of the city, but he is no slave to the machine for he believes that this kingdom has to give way to the kingdom of freedom, when the machine will become the slave of the human being. Whereas for the futurist, the human being is only an addendum to the machine, a spoke in its wheel. Hence N. Goncharova names her paintings: “weaving loom + woman.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Tatlin, the beauty of tin and of the glass cylinder prevails over human beauty, as the artist confessed to me. He impressed me as a deeply sincere person who has lived through a lot of things. “I am no longer interested in anything but form and surface,” he said, while explaining why he was so fond of the intersecting iron, glass, and plaster surfaces. A terrible gust of devastation blew from these words of the artist and from his nailed iron-glass, truly <span style="font-style:italic;">still</span> life.
      </p>
<p>
	It is true that the history of art has had such moments of one-sided concentration on the study of some subordinate discipline. For instance, the Renaissance era was keen on perspective. According to Vasari, Uccello fell into “extravagance and bankruptcy” as a result of his passion for perspective, for geometry. But for the Renaissance painter this research was merely a means to a higher goal: <span style="font-style:italic;">the creation of a painting</span>. Whereas for Tatlin the intersection of planes and corners is a <span style="font-style:italic;">self-goal</span>. It is the truly iron dead-end of the things, the deadening of the soul; it is the devastation of Ivan Karamazov.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">VI</h1>
<p>
	The Karamazov effect... I was told that not long before the war, the German art critic Meier-Graefe gave a conference in which he warned the youth against the fashionable trends in painting. In one of his arguments, Meier-Graefe referred to Dostoevsky’s novel, to the Russian formulae “anything is permitted” and “there is no God,” which in his opinion were a factor in the expansion of futurism in painting. It should be noted, however, that the conscientious German, in his hostility against Russian “nihilism,” forgot—inadvertently or on purpose—to tell his audience that besides Mitenka and Ivan the old Karamazov also has a third son: Aliosha!
      </p>
<p>
	But we should not forget him. His very soul was in this naïve young lady who broke into tears in front of a painting. And while I was leaving the exhibition “Year 1915,” feeling completely worn out and weighed down, as if somebody had just “nailed” my temples, I suddenly remembered the existence of this other principle in the Russian soul, from which one can and should expect deliverance and a way out of the iron dead-end. There is a bright, wise, and gentle love for the world and for the human being, and for the sticky spring leaves; it will lead to the blooming of a true Russian painting, as soon as the storms of the war dust away, as soon as the young seeds of a new Russian culture start growing, enlightened by a greater respect for human life and the human person.

	  Excerpt from Alexei Kruchenykh’s (1886–1968) poem “Na udel’noi” [On Udel’naia str.], 1915, published in the first issue of the literary and artistic journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Strelec</span> [The Archer], ed. by Aleksandr Belenson : 109. This poem describes with humour the nail-operated withdrawal of an abscess from the head of the narrator. In accordance with Kruchenykh’s understanding of <span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">beyonsense</span>, or transrational) poetry, the syntactic rules are neglected, some words are modified, and others are used in inappropriate meanings. The latter applies to the rather colloquial verb <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozdit’</span> which can mean either “to bang, beat, to bang away” or “to repeat, to keep on, to continue stubbornly.” In Kruchenykh’s poem, however, this verb also hints to the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozd’</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">nail</span>), which in Russian does not lead to the verb “to nail.” Tugendkhol’d borrows this ambiguity of <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozdit’</span> (to annoy/to nail) and throughout his article builds it up as a metaphor of the mind-numbing and physically damaging Futurist element.

<p>
      At the turn of the twentieth century, an extended community of American and European actors, dancers, and physical culture teachers created a spectrum of “body cultures” that responded and contributed to social modernity and artistic modernism. Body cultures are theories about how bodies should look, feel, work, and move, and physical practices for training and presenting oneself accordingly. Such combinations of somatic theory and practice are culturally and historically specific, determined by the needs, interests, and places of their making. In this period, they occurred within multiple contexts, including theater, dance, fashion, medicine, labor, sport, and “physical culture” (the contemporary term for calisthenic exercise).<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Collectively, they crafted and visualized a “modern” body, ready for work, play, and self-expression. This essay considers how modern body cultures such as the American Delsarte and Mensendieck systems reached for industrial, disciplinary efficiency and individualized, emancipatory expressiveness, thus uniting social modernity and artistic modernism.
    </p>
<p>
      The body cultures most explicitly and frequently connected to industrial and social modernity are those that pursued engineered efficiency. This somatic ideal can be seen in the rationalized, disciplined, and mechanized body of Taylorized assembly line workers, the Tiller Girls and Ziegfeld Follies theatrical extravaganzas, physical education jumping jacks, the modern military assembly, and the mass movement performances recorded by Leni Riefenstahl. Alternatively, the body culture that is most obviously associated with artistic expressive modernism valued holistic fluidity and the search for archaic, primitive, and authentic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> somatic experience. This relaxed, flexible, and individualized body is associated with the un-corseted and lounging avant-garde elite, the athletic New Woman, barefoot modern dancers, and German <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span>’s nudists frolicking in meadows. Following Foucault, or Adorno and Horkheimer, it is tempting to see bodies in the first category as the subject of discipline, against which those in the second react by remaking the body into a site of liberation.
    </p>
<p>
      Although they seem to be at odds, these two modes of embodiment – disciplinary efficiency and emancipatory expressiveness – actually co-existed and were even united within specific body culture praxis. This essay joins recent scholarship by offering two linked case studies of how modernizing body cultures “often elided the question of the relation between external and internal disciplines, between a mechanical and a motivational or expressive model of the body,” as Tim Armstrong argues in his study of writers’ physical regimes and self-reconstructions.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Similarly, Carrie J. Preston shows that Isadora Duncan, probably the greatest icon of the expressive and organic modern body, “consistently position[ed] her choreography at the juncture of motorized movement and soulful expression.” Duncan herself said that in order to perform, she had to “place a motor in [her] soul.” Although Duncan’s performances appeared to be effortless improvisations, mechanical metaphors abound in her philosophy and process of choreographing, rehearsing, and performing. The force of her “motor” energy, focused through repetition, produced a “multiplied body” that, like a powered machine, accomplished many tasks at once.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Whereas the intellectual lineage from the original French Delsarte system of rhetorical gesture to Duncan and other modern dancers in the United States and Europe is well-recognized, the path from Delsartism to Mensendieck body mechanics exercise is less well known and has yet to be contextualized.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> This essay offers three simultaneous layers of exploration into the expressive efficiencies of American Delsarte and Mensendieck body cultures. First, there is a chronological narrative of how each emerged, the latter out of the former, and how these essentially European schools of body training evolved in American contexts. The character of those changes provides the second layer. Delsarte and Mensendieck formulated extremely orderly systems of movement, one explicitly artistic and the other explicitly mechanical, but both rationalized physical positions and motions. In American contexts, practitioners of each program would increasingly focus on individual personality development, thus merging efficiency and expression. Recovering their similarities enables us to see the third layer; in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some emancipatory forms of artistic modernism and disciplinary forms of social modernity could work together in mutually constitutive ways.
    </p>
<p>
      The importance of uniting expression and efficiency is evident in the early roots of Delsartism. In 1839, French singer François Delsarte introduced an educational system of oratorical gesture that was used in European and American ministry, political speeches, theater, pantomime, dramatic dance, and film acting through the 1920s. He believed that emotions reliably generated uniform, essential, eternal, and specific  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> physical movements. His goal was to study the innate postures, gestures, and facial expressions that revealed genuine emotions, so that actors and other rhetoricians could learn to convincingly and sincerely manifest those feelings.
    </p>
<p>
      Delsarte’s method of theatrical training was based on a rationalized taxonomy of emotional affect, organized in a series of three by three charts. Each limb, appendage, and facial feature was assigned nine positions based on its movement in an “eccentric” (outward), “normal” (orthogonal), or “concentric” (inward) direction. Each position of the hand, arm, leg, head, eyes, and so on, corresponded to a specific emotion, but neither the meaning nor the position were static. Rather, each was modulated by the direction and quality of movement. Motion knit the elements together into a meaningful whole, like the transformation that occurs when letters are arranged into words, and words accumulate into sentences. In the chart of the “Expressions of the Mouth,” when the lips are turned down at the edges, the signified meaning is disapproval. Lips pressed together indicate emotional firmness. In combination, the meaning is “disapproval plus firmness = discontent.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the “Degrees of Affirmation” chart, the arm circles down from “It is absolute, it is enchanting, it is evident, [and] it is certain,” to, at the horizontal position simply, “It is.” Continuing on the lower rotation, the arm signifies “It is probable [. . .] doubtful [. . .] improbable,” “it is not,” “it is impossible,” and finally, “it is evil (or rejected).”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> If one wanted to signify the physical conditions of “fatigue, vertigo, or intoxication,” the straight-legged wide-angled position seen in the center square of the leg positions chart (thus in the “normal-normal” position) was appropriate [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Or, if combined with other signifiers, the same pose could convey “familiarity or vulgar boorishness.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> To our twenty-first-century eyes, the meanings he proposed are not explicit, in part because we learn of them from truncated verbal descriptions and static images of isolated parts. Delsarte saw his system as one that was difficult for performers to learn, but easy for audiences to automatically interpret. If the combination of legible gestures and postures in motion worked semiotically, it was a motivated, not arbitrary, set of specific meanings. By organizing them into nine-fold charts, Delsarte—like the other great taxonomists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century—sorted nature into a manageable and totalizing order. From the chaos of human emotion, he offered an economy of expression.
    </p>
<p>
      Through acts of urban flânerie, Delsarte decoded a visual language that he believed would be useful both for actors on the professional stage and for viewers of everyday urban life. He began formulating his translation of universal body language when he noticed similarities between the thumbs of the dead and those of disaffected childcare workers. After visiting a dissecting-room where he realized the cadavers all had contracted thumbs, he strolled through the Tuileries, observing women holding babies. The “distracted and indifferent” nurses curled their thumbs towards the palm (like the hands of the dead), whereas the loving mothers had thumbs “bent violently outward.” The thumb’s position, he concluded, expressed the degree of life or affirmation. He suggested that such body language offered a built-in lie detector. If one was to ask a favor of a stranger, and the latter pulled in his thumb while answering “yes,” that small gesture showed the body dis-affirming the verbal statement; the stranger did not really  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intend to perform as promised.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the same period, American etiquette writers similarly studied facial expressions, deportment, and clothing to discover true character. These indexes to sincerity, Karen Halttunen argues, were intended to ease the anxiety felt by the urban bourgeoisie when evaluating strangers and possible interlopers. But confidence men, actors, and the bourgeoisie alike studied human behavior and learned to imitate sincere emotion.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

      Such concerns about performing and reading affect through bodily gesture made the late nineteenth-century United States fertile ground for Delsartism, where it was substantially revised and became wildly popular, taken up by preachers, lawyers, politicians, actors, dancers, andrecreationists. The system was introduced by American actor and director Steele MacKaye when he returned from studying with the master himself. In the 1870s, Mackaye and his immediate followers—including oratory professor Lewis Baxter Monroe and Unitarian minister William R. Alger—retained the original emphasis on emotional expression for theatrical performances on stage or in the pulpit. However, within two generations of transmission from Delsarte, the practices, philosophy, teachers, and consumers of American Delsartism diverged from its paternal origin and application. By the 1880s, it evolved into eclectic forms of “aesthetic,” “rhythmic,” “harmonic,” or “society gymnastics” that combined the French system of theatrical expression with contemporary concerns about energy and health. It was increasingly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> taught by women to other women, for exercise, enlightenment, and personal development rather than by men to men for professional theatrical expression. At the end of the nineteenth century, Delsarte’s best-known American practitioners were Genevieve Stebbins (1857–c. 1930) and Henrietta Russell (Hovey) (1849–1918); their reputations grew in the late 1880s and early 1890s when they were teaching primarily middle-aged, upper-class women. Other Delsarte teachers documented by Nancy Lee Chalfa Ruyter include Emily Montague Bishop (1858 – 1916), R. Anna Morris, Eva Allen Alberti, Eleanor Georgen, and Mary Perry King. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CBM</span>).
    </p>
<p>
      By the 1890s, professional performance of genuine emotional content was no longer the central goal. Instead, most American Delsarteans were interested in personal development, and the cultivation of physically attractive and “artistic” gestures in everyday life. During her 1892 visit to New York, Delsarte’s daughter Mme. Marie Géraldy found that although it was “very popular in young ladies’ seminaries and [. . .] clubs,” the added “convolutions” and “flourishes” bore little resemblance to her father’s method. She was not pleased: “I would rather my father were not known at all [. . .] than to be known as he is in your country, that is, as a professor of gymnastics.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Genevieve Stebbins did retain several aspects of traditional Delsartism, namely the nine-square charts of expression; Emanuel Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondence, in which the invisible spiritual world was connected to the visible material world; the theosophical trinity of mind, body and soul; and the study and emulation of Greek sculpture in tableaux vivants. However, the Delsarte revisionists, of which Stebbins, Russell, and Bishop were the most recognized, also introduced several new elements drawn from an international sampling of health regimes and concerns, including Swedish Ling gymnastics, Eastern yoga, and anti-corset dress reform, leading to a new focus on conscientious breathing exercises. They and their followers further Americanized Delsartism by expanding it into a cure for neurasthenia, and a technique for impression management, sociologist Erving Goffman’s term for the cultivated intentional performance of public self.
    </p>
<p>
      In girls’ schools, women’s clubs, and private domestic settings, American Delsarteans addressed the health dangers specific to women who wore corsets that limited their physical activity, including their ability to breathe properly. Stebbins proposed to teach women how to achieve the “power in reserve” that she attributed to ancient Greek sculpture, regularly citing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Venus de Milo</span> as the ideal female torso. In the appendix to <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamic Breathing and Harmonic Gymnastics</span> , Stebbins reproduced a dress reform tract by Sir William Henry Flower, Professor of Comparative Anatomy at the English Royal College of Surgeons [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Flower contrasted the “deformed, fashionable re,” a corseted female body of 1880, to the uncompressed “artistic, natural female body” of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Venus</span>, suggesting the health dangers of the former and recommending the benefits and appearance of the latter.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Indirectly disparaging the intelligence of those women who preferred a tiny waist to efficient lungs, Stebbins called her un-corseted neoclassical aesthetic dress a “brain costume [. . .] because it takes brains to make and wear them.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Thus clothed, her followers could more easily perform the tableaux vivants or the melting pose-to-pose “tableaux mouvants” she  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> invented. Delsartean dress reform and expressive art-inspired exercises appealed to the tastes of elite women while counteracting the kinaesthetic of the constrained, conspicuously ornamented, and objectified female body, famously diagnosed as a symptom of American nouveau riche competitive materialism by sociologist Thorstein Veblen in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Theory of the Leisure Class</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

      Beginning in the late 1880s, at the Chautauqua summer recreation camps for weary east coast urbanites, Emily Bishop led attendees in many of the same physical movements of Stebbins’s Delsartism while helping to take this body culture further toward the goal of self-improvement. Instead of equating emotions and expressive verbal phrases with particular physical gestures, Bishop focused on improving the health of those who desperately needed to learn how to relax in order to be more energetic:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Overwrought, nervous Americans have special need to learn “the gospel of relaxation.” From the cradle to the grave, excitation and strained exertion are the order of most lives. In school, children are urged to injurious nervous efforts in their studies that a high per cent. may be attained. [ . . . ] After school come the drive and the strife of the competitive systems of society and business; the nerves are kept constantly alert in the struggle for wealth, for position, or many times, for the necessities of life. Thus “the pace that kills” has become common with modern men and women.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Bishop’s rhetoric shows that American Delsartism fit into the late nineteenth-century “therapeutic world view” that sought to cure what contemporaries called neurasthenia or nervousness, and that historians have connected to the repressive effects of urban, bourgeois, and increasingly industrialized western culture.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The latter-day Delsarteans promoted their artistic exercises as a response to the modernized lifestyle of competitive but inefficient over-productivity, which incubated nervous deterioration in its subjects.
    </p>
<p>
      Seen in this context, American Delsartism seems “anti-modern,” part of the broader movement that sought a return to authentic, organic, and essential experience, as described by T.J. Jackson Lears in <span style="font-style:italic;">No Place of Grace</span>. Certainly, Stebbins’s aesthetic chitons and philhellenic tableaux vivants gave American Delsartism a reactionary façade, but it was built on a contrived notion of the ancient “natural” body that was no more authentically accessible to the late nineteenth-century New Yorker than was landscaped Central Park a genuine wilderness. Rather, as Hillel Schwartz convincingly argues in his groundbreaking essay, “Torque: The New Kinaesthetic of the Twentieth Century,” French and American Delsartism fit into a cluster of body culture activities that were created <span style="font-style:italic;">in reaction against and in relation to</span> social modernity’s rationalized mechanization of the body into isolated parts. The “current wisdom” that “we have managed speed but not coherence, repetition but not meaning, isolation but not independence, juxtaposition but not integrity,” in the twentieth-century western experience of the body, is only one part of the equation. This critique of the mechanized body assumes a solution: alternate “ideals of movement” that were themselves a distinctly modern approach to the body. These alternate kinaesthetic ideals, found in Delsartism, modern dance, penmanship, zippers, artificial limbs, and other techniques, were articulated and explored in “full-bodied” and fluid movements that function to both reveal and contribute to the making of a unique sense of self. A fragmented sense of the body, Schwartz argues, led to the search for an aesthetic and expressive kinaesthetic, and thus a kinaesthetic that was simultaneously opposed to modernity and constitutive of modernism.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This argument is very useful for modulating Lears’s “anti-modernist” claim, but I want to suggest here that it could go even farther towards finding areas of cohesion between the dichotomous kinaesthetics of industrial efficiency and artistic expressiveness.
    </p>
<p>
      Such cohesion is suggested by recent scholarship that situates turn-of-the-century Delsartism within the distinctly modern and linked cultures of “will” and “personality” that responded to the epidemic of nervousness and fragmentation with self-disciplined body culture practices. Although the expressivist concept of “personality” is usually seen as the antithesis of the modes of self-discipline that characterized earlier ideals of authentic character, the body cultures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries demonstrate a mode of expressivity premised on restraint. In his study of the German “cult of the will,” Michael Cowan charts a broader western movement that “sought to transform mental states through bodily performance” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 119). Rather than seeing neurasthenia as the problem of an over-intellectualized body, many body culture proponents viewed the problem as one of:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	the overwhelming presence of a body in excess, one whose nervous tics, twitches, spasms, pains, cramps, convulsions, and paralyses refused to obey the dictates of the will [. . .] learning to control the excessively nervous body was a key ingredient in the fantasy of regaining control over a modern world that no longer allowed it.
      </p>
<div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 113)
      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Cowan thus argues “in opposition to the oft-repeated contention that early twentieth-century reform programs constituted a ‘rediscovery’ of the body after its ‘suppression’ under nineteenth-century rationalism.” Instead “these programs were driven by precisely the opposite imaginary project; that of taming a rebellious, nervous body in excess” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 17). Containment strengthened and calmed the body, thus readying it for action.
      </p>
<p>
	Physical self-control, including the kind practiced by American Delsarteans, would in turn cultivate not only beauty but also emotional self-possession, and eventually the projection of self-confidence (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 153). Whereas Delsarte originally identified inherent and essential gestures of authentic emotion, revisionists like Russell, Mary Perry King, and poet Bliss Carman re-purposed the study of gesture and comportment to serve the construction of malleable public persona. Drawing on Goffman’s theory of the “presentation of self in everyday life,” Ann Daly suggests that in the first decade of the twentieth century, “like an actor in rehearsal, the Delsartean sought to master the techniques of performance” through repetitive drills, an approach that she sees as disciplinary and repressive, in contrast to Schwartz’s position.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> This quality of rationalizing, fragmenting, and reintegrating kinaesthetic movement, controlling the body, and remaking the personality through conscientious physical practice, was essential to the twentieth-century versions of Delsarte body culture.
      </p>
<p>
	At the turn of the century, Delsartism branched into two directions, modern dance and physical culture. In the United States, Delsartism was carried forward by modern dance pioneers Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis (1879–1968), and Ted Shawn (1891– 1972). Their philosophy and choreography borrowed from the traditional Delsarte lexicon by reproducing art historical imagery and reaching for emotional epiphany through expressive movement. Thanks to their work, Delsartism was extended into twentieth-century dance choreography and the gestural vocabulary of silent film acting. <a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> This trajectory is well known in the scholarship on modern kinaesthetics, but the corresponding physical culture branch of Delsartism, such as that practiced by Bess M. Mensendieck, is less familiar. Before looking in detail at the latter, a quick review of Delsartism’s status within the emerging professional field of physical education will suggest how an artificial dichotomy between bodily expression and muscular efficiency conceptually pushed apart elements that were actually quite similar in practice.
      </p>
<p>
	The impact of Americanized Delsartism on physical culture education is virtually unknown because even as it was occurring, Delsarteans were apologizing for their wayward practitioners and physical education promoters were distancing themselves from its embarrassingly effete reputation. Stebbins acknowledged a split between these groups in the early 1890s. At that time, some of her students were, much to her disappointment, “present[ing] the public with a distortion of psycho-physical culture,”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> which contributed to the raging debate between “the defenders of artistic grace” and “the advocates of muscle.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> When Delsarte teachers Emily M. Bishop and Franklin H. Sargent went before the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education (AAAPE) in 1892, they anticipated—and mostly found—a hostile audience.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Bishop acknowledged that:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  many persons are prejudiced against any teaching that bears the name Delsarte, because they believe that all Delsarte teaching arbitrarily prescribes certain ways to do certain things. [. . .] No wonder that practical teachers of other systems of physical education shrug their shoulders and smile contemptuously at such nonsense; so do practical Delsarte teachers.
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Despite this unfortunate reputation, she insisted, Delsartism is not a series of “arbitrary” poses that “would rob people of all spontaneity, all individuality, would make them mere automatons” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 81). Rather, it promotes relaxation, efficient movements, and genuine personal expression. Turning from negative to positive mechanical metaphors, Bishop subtly reminded her listeners of Delsarte’s original engine-like “law for control: ‘strength at the center, freedom at the surface,’” and explicitly referred to strong bodies as “good machines [that] in themselves are not enough. In order to save these machines from tear and to make them wear well, we must know how to run them with the least amount of friction” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 84–85). Delsartism could provide this lesson, turning muscle into productivity through proper movement. Despite Bishop’s efforts to show the functional value of Delsarte movements, Harvard physical education innovator Dudley A. Sargent was unconvinced. Delsartism, he responded bluntly, “is not a system of physical training and you cannot make it so in any way.” Unlike the Swedish Ling gymnastics, which he favored, Delsartism was useless because it does not cultivate muscular “bodily vigor”; from his perspective, the two approaches to health were “diametrically opposed” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 89). J. Madison Taylor of Philadelphia was more optimistic; he saw through superficial differences and mirrored one of the core principles of American Delsartism—“grace is the economy of force” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 85)—when he added:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  I think we have grasped the fact that the animus is to bring the greatest possible efficiency and grace to persons who have bad muscular habits. These two systems, which are traveling in parallel lines, may, I think, safely inosculate.

	  Although Bess Mensendieck’s system was not widely known in the American physical education community before the 1930s, it may be considered the marriage of the “advocates of muscle” to the “defenders of artistic grace” that Taylor predicted at the 1892 AAAPE meeting. The Mensendieck system merged goals of muscular efficiency and expressive grace, and in turn contributed to both dance and physical education of the twentieth century. Elizabeth Marguerite de Varel Mensendieck (c.1866–1959), better known as Bess M. Mensendieck, was a Dutch American<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> who studied Delsartism with Stebbins prior to forging her own exercise system. The “Mensendieck System of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Functional Exercises” was designed to maximize the efficiency of the “human machine and mechanisms through which it functions.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Her approach was physiological: not psychological, not spiritual, not emotional. In the only book-length study of American Delsartism published to date, Nancy Lee Chalfa Ruyter observes that Stebbins’s followers (including Mensendieck) contributed to early twentieth-century German modern dance and physical culture but with a significant difference: “The emphasis was [. . .] on the facility and quality of movement rather than on the Delsartean canon of expressive gestures or attitudes.” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CBM,</span> 71). In the long run however, it served a new kind of expressivity, forged through a new degree of bodily efficiency.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck did not agree with most physical education drills and sports, but she also thought that expressive and aesthetic gymnastics were superficial, unscientific, and insulting to women’s intelligence. Particularly disturbing to Mensendieck were Stebbins’s metaphysical additions, which she called “loads of blooming rubbish.” She aimed to strip away this “curse of ridiculousness” and restore the underlying principles of Delsarte and Ling muscular control without their “metaphysical squiggles.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In addition to rejecting Delsartism’s attachment to archaic universal spiritual and emotional meanings, Mensendieck later differentiated her rationalized physical culture system from the expressive avant-garde modern dance of Weimar Germany and interwar America. “It is not by cultivating bizarre and exaggerated types of dance movements that bodily perfection is to be attained” nor could it “be acquired by a so-called ‘expressionism,’ which, through bodily contortions, gives rein to a fancy even less esthetic than are the movements themselves.” Citing Nietzche, she forwarded bodily discipline, rather than the soul, as the origin of and route to self-discovery and graceful kinaesthetic style.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck’s system came to public attention through her role in Kaiser Wilhelm II’s court, a network of schools, and a series of publications in German, Dutch, and English. The Kaiser hired her to improve the posture of courtiers who “in an effort to appease him, whenever they stood at attention in his presence [. . .] folded their hands over their bulging abdomens. This posture made them look like fantastic beer-mugs, a sight which vexed Wilhelm further.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Between 1905 and 1924, Mensendieck and her followers established schools in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, France, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> John Martin, the leading modern dance critic in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, commended Mensendieck for her influence on German modern dance in a 1929 <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> article:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    It is [. . .] in the work of Bess Mensendieck that the romantic—or if you will, the modern— dance theory finds its completion. Like Isadora, an American far better known and valued abroad than at home, Dr. Mensendieck took her stand against vicarious experience. In her scheme of themes this did not concern esthetic or emotional problems, but simple physical ones. The dance was not her interest, but through her development of a new and radical method of physical education the dance has profited incalculably. It is no secret that most of the modern German physical culture dancing is a direct outgrowth of her pioneering.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The “romantic theory” of modern dance (as Martin called it), was associated most prominently with Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis in the U.S., and in Europe with Rudolf Bode, Émile Jacque-Dalcroze, Rudolf von Laban, and Mary Wigman. They valued the “expression of personally felt emotional experience,” Martin remarked.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> He also recognized that although this was not Mensendieck’s goal, her work was a formidable and formative element in expressive and artistic kinaesthetic modernism.
	</p>
<p>
	  During the first two decades when the Mensendieck system was spreading rapidly through northern Europe, its growth in the United States was happening at a slower and less-publicized pace. In 1937, its founder blamed the American Comstock obscenity laws for having restricted her ability to lecture, teach, or publish with the necessary nude demonstrations (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, xi), but there is evidence that in the 1910s she and her followers were giving clothed lessons at schools for young women, and nude private instruction in New York City, even before she established the Mensendieck Central Institute there in 1923.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> American versions of her publications were delayed until the 1931 release of <span style="font-style:italic;">“It’s Up to You”</span>, which features res partially clothed, thanks to the photographic retoucher. In the 1930s, she was teaching on the modern dance faculty at the New School for Social Research in New York and Boston University while publishing American volumes featuring her students’ accomplishments in the United States.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1937, the system was employed at Yale and other “eminently respectable schools” in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and had “won over 200,000 disciples, two-thirds of them women” worldwide, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Magazine</span>. <a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Although the system was originally designed for adult women, students who went on to teach her system in the U.S. passed it on to diverse publics, including young athletes, dancers, physical education instructors, and elite women and businessmen who wanted better poise.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck started her exercise system with a goal shared by other Delsarteans; she wanted to make the human body into an art form. In the 1890s, she moved to Paris and took studio courses in sculpting clay from life. Carrying on the Delsartist ideal of Greek bodies, she was critical of the models’ res and comportment. In contrast to the perfected bodies in Hellenic art, the models had heavy thighs, puffy arms, narrow chest carriage, and jerking movements. “If some models could have the beautiful lines of masterful Greek statues why couldn’t others?” she wondered. “To be sure, not everyone could be a Venus or an Adonis, but it seemed that many did not develop the full potentialities of their bodies.” Recognizing this unrealized capacity for health and beauty, Mensendieck decided to become a “sculptor in flesh.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Instead of translating living bodies into static art, she would re-shape bodies into living art.
	</p>
<p>
	  Despite this original continuity with Delsartism, Mensendieck’s approach to kinaesthetics turned increasingly scientific and intellectual because of her encounter with French physiological studies and her orientation within the culture of will power (discussed above). She left art school and enrolled in the Medical College in Paris, eventually finishing her degree at the University of Zurich. While at the Medical College in Paris, she worked in the lab of the late Dr. Guillaume B. Duchenne de Boulogne (1806–1875). Duchenne’s lab electrically stimulated human muscles in order  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to determine their function, an approach called the “Physiology of Motion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 5–6). Like Delsarte, Duchenne was codifying emotional expression, but purely on the basis of muscle action. By applying electrical current directly to his subjects’ heads, he determined which muscles changed facial expression from a grimace to a smile and back again. Instead of reading the body for external signs of emotion as Stebbins had taught her to do, Mensendieck learned to correlate movement—even the appearance of emotion—with muscle stimulation from the nervous system. As she recalled years later, Duchenne’s experiments prompted her curiosity: “If an electric current stimulated the muscle into action,” she wondered, “could not the brain do as much? Could not the will power of the individual be used to stimulate specific, neglected muscles? If will power were exerted and the muscle brought into use, what influence would this have upon the muscle shape?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 5–7). The influence of that lab appears when she employed electrical stimulation as a metaphor for will power, asserting “no artificial device can equal in strength, in delicacy and in efficiency the power of the will-current which the brain is able to send through the nerves to stimulate the muscles to act” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 27). It was in this period that Mensendieck developed her understanding of the relationship of muscular, skeletal, and neurological systems, and began to focus on the relationship between these systems and proprioception, which is the body’s internal sense of movement through space, a key component of kinaesthetics.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck’s system tested the power of the mind to retrain muscles and thus reshape bodies for better health and greater beauty, and eventually higher freedom. Instead of a stated emotional or spiritual motivation, her system would be driven by the intellect. There was no place in her program for the Delsartean goal of teaching the body to expressively mirror the emotions. Neither did she tolerate the dumb muscle stimuli of Duchenne’s experiments. Instead of equating gestures with emotions, Mensendieck identified the smoothest, most concise, and most energy-enhancing ways to sit, rise, stand, walk, bend, lift, and breathe. Then, using this knowledge, she helped students learn how to “make his intelligence the engineer for running his body machine <span style="font-style:italic;">according to the mechanical laws established by nature</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 16). In contrast to the expressive and spiritual character of Stebbins’s American Delsartism, the Mensendieck system was intellectual, scientific, and pragmatic.
	</p>
<p>
	  American Delsarteans helped the overstressed to relax, but Mensendieck blamed slumped relaxation for weakening bodies. People needed to cultivate vigilant self-awareness, self-control, and increased muscular tension, not its opposite. Mensendieck saw her system as a cure for the ugly bodies damaged by modern dress, work posture, bad diet, and lack of exercise. The habits of everyday life eroded the body’s efficiency, creating poor body mass alignments that had long-term damaging effects. Like other feminist health reformers, she crusaded against “that worst of all autocrats—Madame La Corsetiere.” Women’s bodies suffered new problems with post-corset freedom. Accustomed to an external support, their back and abdominal muscles were weak, and their bellies bulged out when they exhaled.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> “Wearing abnormally-shaped shoes” that caused wearers to put too much weight on the heel or on the toe damaged posture, as did the casual stance of “standing, slumped sideways, with more weight on one leg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> than the other” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 38). Photographic illustrations from her American publications identify a population whose enjoyment of cigarettes, telephones, and fur coats comes with the casual physical self-presentation associated with kinaesthetic modernity, according to Peter Stearns’s work on the history of posture.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> The incorrect bodies slouch, bellies and chins thrust forward, knees locked, and calves hyper-extended to the rear. In her 1937 volume, Mensendieck chides her photographed subject [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]: “Does the mere act of lighting a cigarette call for such a general displacement of body-masses— such ugly outlines?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 10). The solution was a holistic and constant mind-body renovation, accomplished by intentional muscular tonicity. She advocated training the body and mind to work together to make self-conscious muscle placement and movement through space into learned and automatic habit. With proper breathing, posture, and movements, the muscles could be re-educated so that the relationship between nervous system, bone structure, and musculature worked together.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck promoted an efficiency of movement engaged with the new industrial streamlined sense of the body’s mobile power. The body was a machine, an engine, a work of architecture. Describing the body in these terms filled what she saw as a linguistic void: “WE HAVE NO LANGUAGE FOR DESCRIBING BODILY MOVEMENT,” she lamented (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 2). Consequently, writers who wanted to describe grace in motion employed meaningless clichés or gave up entirely, instead praising famously graceful res like the actress Eleanora Duse for her “essentially spiritual” performances. “No matter how spiritual the message,” Mensendieck reminded her readers, “the body must be the carrier of that message” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 3). Like other machines, the body machine deserved “labor saving” efforts to prevent the “wasteful use of muscular energy” that occurs “when we bring into use groups of muscles which are not required for the act to be performed” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 27). Mensendieck wanted to reduce such waste, and prevent the unnecessary fatigue everyday movements caused. This was a matter of retraining the body into a better servant and retraining the mind into a better master. In an illustration of a “too close approach” to opening a cabinet door [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>], Mensendieck faulted the model’s posture but also blamed her brain for sending an inefficient “order” that caused “multiple ‘detours’ of muscular energy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 146). Determining and using the right muscles in correct sequence with smooth timing, which Mensendieck called “physiological rhythm,” was an essential component in achieving efficiency, poise, and shapeliness (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 33–35).
	</p>
<p>
	  Because muscular realignment could not occur without seeing how the body worked, Mensendieck discarded Delsartism’s Grecian tunics and instituted more effective methods for visual inspection of muscular function: nudity and mirrors. In her physical culture treatises and in her classrooms, Mensendieck teachers and students worked naked or clothed only for the barest modesty, so that no muscles, tonic or slack, evaded view. The exercises were performed in rooms equipped with two mirrors, one parallel to the front of the body, and the other at an angle that allowed the exerciser to see her opposite side reflected in the front mirror [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]. The two mirrors “train the eye to be the guardian which ‘polices’ the body, which locates the truant muscles that habitually shirk their functions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 69).

	  in the Mensendieck system, the body was rationalized and inspected by the supervisor (teacher) and by the supervised, who learned how to self-regulate. Clearly Mensendieck’s pedagogical methods fall within Foucault’s regimes of normalization, but cultural circumstances suggest alternate meanings as well.
	</p>
<p>
	  Although the teachers inspected students’ nude bodies and coached them towards physical uniformity, it was not the “impossible surrender” some imagined, according to a student who studied Mensendieck techniques at Hedwig Hagemann’s school in Germany. Rather, there was nothing more beautiful than to observe and correct one’s own body. Through such efforts, even the imperfectly built re could achieve beauty and harmony through elastic and energetic movement, but the power to make such changes were held by “the person alone, he alone has it in his hand” and only accessed by contemplating one’s unclothed reflection. “[One] must go to this naked moment,” the young woman wrote, to win physical, spiritual, and emotional freedom.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> This pronudity student was the Norwegian-born dancer Fé Alf (1910–1996) who immigrated to the United States in 1931 and promoted body culture for pregnant women, the most significantly feminist and eugenic aspects of Mensendieck’s program. Alf’s perspective reflects her training in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span>-influenced Hagemann school. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> combined back-to-nature nude dance and athletic recreation in outdoor settings with notions of feminist self-determination, self-discipline, and increased labor productivity.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> It was a reaction to the mechanization and rationalization of modern life, and intended to open the body for experiences of “freedom of identity and action,” both individually and collectively beneficial, especially for women, argues historian Karl Toepfer (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 10–11). Thus, like other body cultures that yoked efficiency and expression, Toepfer  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> finds that “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> consistently presented itself as a sign of modernity and an aspect of modernism rather than as a reaction against both” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 31). Mensendieck did not connect nudity to nature appreciation, as did her <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> contemporaries and some of her students, notably Hagemann and Alice Bloch, but she did share its belief in freedom through discipline. In her thinking, nudity increased productivity through rationalization and control of the body’s systems and movements, which would ultimately result in greater agency and self-realization.
	</p>
<p>
	  In a cultural formation parallel to the earlier Americanization of Delsartism, Mensendieck practitioners turned a rational system of movement into personality development, thus merging efficiency and expression. Mensendieck signaled this ethos when she titled her 1931 U. S. publication <span style="font-style:italic;">“It’s Up to You”</span>, a culturally-relevant shift from the earlier <span style="font-style:italic;">Körperkultur der Frau</span> (Physical Culture for Women). In the later American text, she wrote that having “trained himself to hold in mind, consciously, until it shall have become <span style="font-style:italic;">second-nature</span>, an ideal of the most perfect way to perform movement,” a person was, like a skilled writer or public speaker, ready to give graceful form to meaning (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 31). “Correct automatisms” facilitated full-bodied and individual expression: “the power of the soul, which animates the face, also permeates the entire body; [and] bodies differ in expression as much as faces. The personality is expressed by the individual as a whole, not by his face alone” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 33, 32). In the early 1940s, Fé Alf was teaching Mensendieck body mechanics and poise at Donu Edmond’s House of Prana, a “New York beauty establishment.” The “psychological factor of looking well” dominated press coverage of Alf’s lessons and the appended Lane Bryant maternity-wear fashion shows held at the House of Prana.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> The beauty spa’s name is a play on words that encapsulates the trajectory from Delsarte’s spiritually-inflected mid-nineteenth-century program to the personality-oriented early twentieth-century versions of American Delsarte and Mensendieck body cultures. In the yogic tradition, prana is the “breath of life,” energy that circulates in the air, and the solar plexus is considered the “store-house of prana.” The adjusted phrase implies a fashion designer’s atelier (e.g., House of Worth, House of Chanel).<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Like Stebbins, Edmond appropriated eastern spirituality to turn exercise into western confidence building.
	</p>
<p>
	  Edmond hired Alf to help women, pregnant or not, to build strength, trim fat, suit their demeanor to clothing, and manage their public impressions. During the fall of 1941, the pregnant Alf taught other expectant mothers how to perform everyday movements such as “standing, stooping, reaching and lifting” safely and with grace: “When you stretch to smooth the far corner of your bed, pull yourself stiff and keep your whole body in a straight line.” In the accompanying photo, her right leg is impressively extended in an elevated arabesque while her arm reaches in the opposite direction to pull the bedclothes taut. She explained this pose in terms of body mechanics. One should “Extend one leg for balance, in order to distribute the effort of the movement over as many parts of your body as possible.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> There were also lessons in how to kinaesthetically negotiate non-domestic terrain. For example, Edmond’s press release promised that any woman who attended Alf’s course would learn  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    how to enter a crowded lobby or dining room and either attract attention of every man and woman there, or enter inconspicuously and unnoticed according to her desire[. . .] . [W]e must be aware of our inner selves, of how we look, what we are and the impression we are creating by our movements, and not trust to luck.
	  </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  By controlling one’s every move, adjusted according to one’s wardrobe, hair-do, and make-up of the moment, women could “create an effect in harmony with what they are or to develop into what they want to be.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Frankfurt School and Foucauldian analyses of mechanized and disciplined corporeality are immeasurably useful and important, but they have made it difficult to see how such kinaesthetic practices ever could be genuinely expressive and individualized. Certainly, the body cultures under discussion here may have cultivated a false sense of consciousness, interiority, or self-possession that worked to motivate or sedate workers and consumers. However, it is worth considering how the American Delsarte and Mensendieck practices attempted to achieve kinesthetic freedom by uniting the values of industrial modernity and artistic modernism.
	</p>
<p>
	  Recent philosophers and historians, namely Richard Shusterman, Michael Cowan, Michael Hau, and Tim Armstrong, have argued that self-conscious body mechanics and orthopedics programs, such as those taught by F. Matthias Alexander, the American Posture League, Mensendieck and others in this period, facilitated individualized aesthetic sensitivity and liberated self-control.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Body consciousness is not always anxiety about exposure, surveillance, criticism, and lack of control. In the body cultures under discussion here, physical self-discipline could be a way of cultivating or maintaining agency, just as neurasthenia could be a way of refusing discipline. Although such orderly bodily techniques conflict with current notions that kinesthetic freedom is uncontrolled and spontaneous movement (akin to the ideologies of the free market, free will, and consumer choice), in the same way that mastering verbal language gives us the flexibility to express ourselves fluidly, somatic programs like those discussed here provided a stable base from which bodily improvisation was not only possible but empowered. Both promoted rationalized and disciplined movement as the premise for individual expressivity.
	</p>
<p>
	  The trajectory from Delsarte expression to Mensendieck exercise, as it evolved in the United States, demonstrates a cultural negotiation between disciplinary efficiency, and emancipatory expressiveness. Although the original French Delsarte system of rhetorical gesture was highly rationalized and furthermore, informed by the distinctly modern urban experience of observing and assessing strangers, American Delsarteans transformed it into women’s “society gymnastics” that cured neurasthenia and cultivated personal appearance. This provided the basis for early twentieth-century modern dance choreography, the sine qua non of expressive embodied modernism, but the Mensendieck physical culture system was a simultaneous and complementary offshoot. Promoting health in terms of engineered muscular efficiency, her nude body-mechanics rehabilitation program espoused repetitive self-discipline as the necessary route to liberated individuality. Its historical position, between the values of scientific management and those associated with the movement practices that came out of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> American Delsartism, illuminates unforeseen similarities between those two body cultures, namely the rationalization of movement in service of individual expression. Recognizing this shared territory repositions the mechanized kinaesthetic of social modernity in relation to the expressive body cultures associated with artistic modernism; they existed in co-existed in intimate and even collaborative tension, not simply in opposition to one another.

		Following Karl Toepfer’s example, I use the term “body cultures” instead of the more popular contemporary academic term “physical culture” because in the early years of the twentieth century the term “physical culture” differentiated exercise from dance.

These contemporary historians of early twentieth-century <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> insist that German nudist physical culture contributed to, but was neither directly responsible for nor exclusively attractive to the developing Nazi philosophy of nationalist racial hygiene. Mensendieck’s League for Better Bodies, established in 1924 and mentioned in “Finds Beauty Lies in Muscle Control,” invites analysis on how German and American eugenics programs intersected, but the topic is too complex to address here, other than to warn readers against a reductive interpretation.

      Meditating upon the emblem of St. Mark in a sequence of poems devoted to the “Evangelistic Beasts,” D. H. Lawrence casts a question at Mark’s God: “Would a wingless lion lie down before Thee, as this winged lion lies?”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> This man, both animal and saint, fascinates him, this “lion” who “welped, and was Mark.” A re plunged equally in darkness and light, in body and spirit, in revelation and enigma, he embodies Lawrentian primitive vitality. Yet the question implies, too, that the mere cat—the “wingless lion”—remains uncertainly apart from his God, resists salvation and retains its strangeness, even as its assimilation to the man, its hybridized kinship, paradoxically confirms this human spiritual perfection. Where does that animal fall, into a new heaven or a darkened earth? And is it <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> particular cat (Tibby or Marmelade, lion or leopard, domesticated or wild?), or is it the cat in general, or even more generally its animality, which is found at once to transform and evade the human, so? It is unclear how the cat matters to the idea: if we discover in the elusive animal, as Lawrence wishes us to, a redemptive, sensual and spiritual vitality suppressed by modern industrial life, do we thereby leave all individuality and history behind for some primitivist mirage, for a superficially down-to-earth but subtly transcendental assertion?
    </p>
<p>
      Thus argues literary scholar Philip Armstrong, though he maintains that Lawrence, along with the modernist avant-garde, also establishes a valuable critique of reigning humananimal relations: “In its distaste for modernity,” the primitivist project in high modernism draws Western society towards the post-Darwinian, “biocentric” animality identified by modernist scholar Margot Norris, and pushes it away from sentimenta  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and anthropomorphic clichés of non-human life consistent with ideologies of human supremacy and progress. Yet this critique comes with its own ideological cost, for modernist writing characteristically makes of the animal an abstract synecdoche for the plenum of asocial, feral Nature that is the transcendental signifier of biocentric writing. Modernism steps “outside of history altogether, seeking solace or guidance in a timeless dimension where animals, human environments, and the relations between them can be seen essentially, as they are, as they always have been.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> I will argue that while it is true that both critique and abstraction are endemic to modernist writing about animals, neither is history programmatically abstracted and transcended, nor does biocentrism readily signify without it. And the cat does matter.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Modern Icon</h1>
<p>
	In a sweeping historical argument, Michel Foucault argued that Western knowledge has been conditioned by three epistemic epochs. Such grand schemas, dedicated as they are to generalities, have hardly survived a postmodern critical fetish that has unceasingly sought, collected, deconstructed, and rearticulated the differential and the particular. Yet Foucault’s early, tripartite history of knowledge discourses moving from the machineries of pre-modern resemblance, to those of Enlightenment classification, to those of organic historicity in the modern period, which he supposed to have reached an ambiguous, posthuman limit at the end of the last century, seems to describe very well the typology if not history of one transhistorical kind of image: that of the creature at once human and non-human. There have always been popular stories and images of anthropomorphic animals and theriomorphic people. In folk tales corresponding to Foucault’s pre-modern period, for example, werewolves or mermaids partly assimilate the human re to a dangerous, non-human nature; but as we see in heraldry, in the werewolf and birds in <span style="font-style:italic;">lais</span> of Marie de France, in the pre-Christian animism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>, in the scholarly cat of the Old Irish poet, or in many other instances of appropriation of non-human lives to human cultural iconology, these mediatory creatures with a foot, fin, paw, wing, branch, or claw in the realm of a frightening non-human nature also lend attributes of power to a henceforth re-articulated and re-affirmed human institution.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Such totemic creatures are distinct from the friendly or villainous tricksters that populate other folk tales such those collected by the Grimms—the talking fox, the clothed cat, the pigs and goats with human houses—which keep their human and animal parts exclusively signified and merely combinatory. Such combinatory play in what Foucault considered a later, Enlightenment classificatory mindset, however significant as a symptomatic cultural practice, is easily surpassed by the uniquely modern iconography in which human and animal traces fused into a new creaturely sign. Walt Disney’s Donald Duck is neither a bird that talks, nor a human who quacks, but a unified organic re with traces of duck and human drawn into each vocal syllable and graphic line, a re whose identity and coherence is sustained not by the recognition of individual parts but by the dynamic and functional orchestra of parts in motion, organizing its own space and time.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	In a similar if more somber iconographic mode, in his graphic-narrative memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Noa Noa</span> , Paul Gauguin joined a Tahitian woman in mocking the dour, industrious ants and carelessly singing grasshoppers of La Fontaine—and in doing so did more than re-code a conventional morality in reverse, a familiar mark of the bohemian artist. In writing this anecdote into his fictionalized memoir, he transposed the singing voice of the grasshopper into Maohi language—“<span style="font-style:italic;">Ia Orana</span>”—in the mouth of the woman Vaïtua, herself seen to metamorphose into a purring cat whose “feet caressed the wooden bedpost like the tongue of a tiger around a skull,” and who laments to Gauguin of the collective, singing voices of a pre-colonial, now dispossessed Tahiti. In that Tahiti, Gauguin tells us, the grasshopper was a very different kind of human-animal hybrid, the reincarnated spirit of a killed child.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The segments of signs and histories in Vaïtua’s ration are here entangled in an overtly intoxicated, erotic encounter with the bedridden Gauguin, with the trade in alcohol, with animal-human metamorphoses that give birth to heterodox desires and social relations, and with a lethal undertone that is at once personal and political. This grasshopper-colony-child-cat-woman whose portrait Gauguin sketches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Noa Noa</span> is thus incomprehensible except as a primitivist chain of metaphors and relations whose roots grip Vaïtua’s and Gauguin’s personal encounter and political histories—a complex chain made coherent by the fluid, contingent interface between a colonial Tahitian subject and a cosmopolitan modernist style. In this flickering, shadowy succession of human and animal, of individual and social, of political and aesthetic signs, we confront neither allegory nor code, but a semiotically heterogeneous, historically evolved, unique icon. To make sense of it, we are obliged to adopt Foucault’s modernist episteme, in which the recognition of a relational “organism takes precedence over the search for taxonomic characteristics,” just as classificatory “language loses its privileged position and becomes, in its turn, a historical form coherent with the density of its own past.” For Foucault, such an episteme at once and paradoxically establishes “man” as the master of history, and suspends this mastery over the occultation of his being in language, a being that must, however, reabsorb and erase him in turn.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In modern primitivism and popular comics alike, this fragile, <span style="font-style:italic;">chiaroscuro</span> suspension reveals its gender and animal troubles most acutely.

	Perhaps an anxiety to distinguish humans from animals has served or dogged Occidentals throughout history, but a modernist turn to that history will be the subject of the following pages. While res of all species are drawn into this new vortex, and notably the ape, it is the <span style="font-style:italic;">cat</span> that will embody most fully and contradictorily modernism’s fears and exhilarations.

	The apologist for this felinomorphic modernism is the master of weird fiction, H. P. Lovecraft. Writing in 1937, his words reflect the spirit of a diverse modernist caste. Oscar Wilde, W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and T. S. Eliot were cat people. H. D. and D. H. Lawrence were cat people. e e cummings, W. C. Williams, and Tennessee Williams were cat people. Hieratic cats pad their way through the writing of Yeats, Eliot, Lawrence, and Pound, half-remote, teasing res of estranged desire and revelation. Both an Egyptian cat divinity and the lion lend their names to E. M. Forster’s errant clerk, Leonard Bast. The cat appears as a pictographic icon of Pound himself—and as the icon of a generation—on the stark, totemic cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pound Era</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>].<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Joyce tried to adapt cat speech to human language. Eliot wrote verse portraits of cats. Zora Neale Hurston became a talking cat, defying White American readers to outwit her and assimilate her writing. Meanwhile, across North America, “dark humanoid” cats multiplied in cinema cartoons, newspaper comics, and their spin-off toy industries.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> A closer look at several of these felinomorphic res will help to explain their curious iconic significance as “runes” of a threatening but seductive post-human condition.

<p>
	Having just heard Lovecraft, it is natural to begin with his own cat people, whose consubstantiality with the horror of the “unnamable,” yet also embodiment of cuteness, mark them as modernist antetypes of the myriad weird-cute res generated by today’s manga aesthetic.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Lovecraft’s talking cats are “more ancient than the Sphinx” whose “language” they speak; they are “heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa”; they bear “tales from forgotten cities in Meroë and Ophir; they are “cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Yet they are sweet little things, too. After one of Lovecraft’s travelers into dark realms entertains a black kitten, who jumps into his lap “to purr and play” before curling up beside him to sleep, then leaves the kitten a “saucer of rich cream in the morning,” this traveler’s obscure, “ancient friendship with the species” is recalled by the kitten’s feline clan. The cute scene thus expresses what is revealed to be a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> bond with the cats, legitimates it, and leads to his later rescue from a monstrous death by an army of cats metamorphosed into a “cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws” unleashed “tidally and tempestuously upon it,” after which the cats return him cozily and gracefully to the human world.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In Lovecraft’s terrifying borderline world, in which a darkly obscure, shapeless, inarticulate, violent, chaotic, inhuman substratum of existence seethes beneath the fragile, artificial, articulate surface of humanity, cats are privileged mediators: they are furry little Nietzscheans, knowing the horror of that existential reality, yet refusing its <span style="font-style:italic;">anomie</span> with aesthetic integrity protected by a chivalric code.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	The same integrity and code, a similar cuteness, and a parallel mediating function— between dark, existential violence and diminutive aesthetic order—is condensed into the house cat of D. H. Lawrence’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>. Birkin’s “young grey lord” presents an emblem of “superfine stability” to Ursula, as they hotly debate the nature of love and equality of the sexes. The pet’s fluid, graceful manner compels admiration, comprising both order and violence as he masterfully pummels a trespassing stray—and erotic interest—into submission.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The cat here again represents the <span style="font-style:italic;">Übermensch</span> as animal, but unlike Nietzsche’s allegorical lion, the small domestic species is animal in a minor key: an icon not of feral Mastery but of a more contingent, social mastery; not of autochthonous Stability but of ephemeral, performative stability; not of Beauty but, in Birkin’s and Ursula’s differing views of the cats and each other, of debatable beauty—a smaller, more intimate sign. This refusal to equate animals with anthropomorphic absolutes, while providing parables of the human, might seem muddled. But for Jeff Wallace, these discursive ambivalences as instructively dialectical: the sign of the animal is a contingent, corrigible anthropomorphism, in which the question of the human as such is never obscured.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Hence the cat who plays its part in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span> is not a sign of the Human, for Birkin and Ursula, but of the diminutively and contingently, merely here-and-now human, a human that may become something else in a future that both these lovers <span style="font-style:italic;">as lovers</span> ultimately look forward to, in a modernist undoing of boundaries and assertion of creative self-definition. And again, just as for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Lovecraft, this minor mastery, which mediates the human and existential life with style, is provisionally coded male. The woman is on the side of the stray (here a female cat, feral, coming from outside upon Birkin’s and his pet’s domestic property), thus of the pure wild, of absorption into the very chaotic otherness that is the felinomorphic modernist’s penumbral resource for creative, transgressive possibility. Yet the roles of mediating agency (male) and mediating representation (female) are difficult to keep separate, and these too crisscross and become interchangeable, so that in Lawrence’s novel neither Birkin nor Ursula can be straightforwardly masculine or feminine, but flirt with androgyny. We have already seen this flirtation in Gauguin’s performance of Vaïtua, a narrative re (both agent and object) in which voices (his and hers) and styles (Maohi and European modernist) mingle in one icon.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

      Using quotation marks, the male poet marks his own speech as a snippet of actual conversational speech, and moreover, as just the sort of languid, tossed-off stuff that he associates with women. Yet despite the emphatic emptiness of meaning, there is another mode of communication going on, beneath the visible surface, that is felinomorphic: the purring that is not soporific, but stimulating, a revitalizing resource, a prick. The male poet is from one perspective here a re of mastery, like Birkin’s cat, subduing wild, inarticulate truths held by the cat-woman and her ambiguous species. Yet the cat-woman is already a mediator, purring in a language that the poet merely cribs—or indeed, as I began by suggesting, that is indistinguishable from his in style. If that were not all, the cat-woman’s antennae must inevitably recall Pound’s famous theriomorphic re of the poet as the “antenna of the race,” an inhuman creature feeling ahead into the darkness of the future.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In this <span style="font-style:italic;">persona</span>, one might well ask, who is male and who female, who the cat and who the poet, who the actor and who the representation? The modernist icon evokes and fuses categories into chains of association, rooted in a contingent, historically marked situation. The aloof, cryptic cat is again a sign of boundary crossing and mediation, one in which language—purring, tactile, stylish—expresses a post-human, and hence liminally linguistic limit.

      Modernist cats morphed across lives. H. D.’s daughter recalls the small turquoise cat that hung around her mother’s neck, which like a “mantra,” she “sat gazing at . . . for hours, fingering it, running it up and down the [black] velvet ribbon” while thinking, reading, and writing. This totem resembles those of Pound, Lawrence, and Lovecraft:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Genuine or fake, a link with the Pharaohs or merely a souvenir from this century—she is beautiful. She sits inch high, with a proud elongated posture. Her features are finely drawn. They vary—lofty, remote, almost disdainful at times; then tender, then again, inscrutable; always aristocratic. Between her front paws, pressed against her chest, she guards a microscopic replica, her kitten.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      The cat’s deconstruction of dualisms of serious and cute, of hieratic and domestic, of autonomous and kinship-bound, of exotic heritage (relic) and modern tourism (souvenir), and after all, its affirmation by an aesthetic code, is felinomorphically identified with H. D. herself, as both the memoir’s title announces and H. D. herself makes clear its writer.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Does it matter if this cat-woman is “genuine or fake”? To question the distinction—in what one inherits from H. D., as daughter or as reader—is to embrace an identity that refuses to impose the truly literary, truly feminine, or truly human, and to affirm beauties of one’s own and their nurture on a “microscopic” scale, perhaps invisible to others at large.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Posthuman Desire</h1>
<p>
      The assertion of a radically indeterminate humanity is hardly limited to private or hieratic icons: the same is found in the most celebrated comic strip of the age, George Herriman’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Krazy Kat</span> (1913–1944), reputed to have been read by Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Edmund Wilson, e e cummings, Louis Zukovsky, and T. S. Eliot.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> In this anthropomorphic animal strip syndicated by Hearst, a carefree cat, Krazy, is in love with a scornful mouse, Ignatz, whose compulsion is to throw bricks at the cat’s head. The cat interprets the missiles as love messages, but the mouse is punished by a watchful dog, Offissa Pupp. On this narrative basis, Herriman played thousands of variations, daily and weekly, over thirty years of the strip’s run. The racial and sexual ambiguity of the Kat, and the modernist aesthetics of language, narrative, and image in the strip, were evident to fans (indeed, the strip was adapted to jazz ballet, with a comics libretto by Herriman, in 1922) and have drawn renewed attention from scholars today.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The Kat, like other funny animals in comics and animated cartoons, is a stylistic synthesis of the human and the animal in a creature that is both and neither. The style rendering him/her is an erratic, scratchy line always on the verge of falling into a stumble of crosshatches or a tangle of jarred squiggles. This absorption of re into style is a familiar modernist project, and its effects here are particularly striking, where it asserts the fragile material identity of beings from panel to panel. The identifiability of creatures and of actions follows a razor’s edge along Herriman’s ecstatically hasty, insistently un-masterful line. The same applies to settings, panels, and layout, which morph surrealistically across narratives held together by his creatures. The setting is an imaginary desert in Kokonino Kounty, a stark world based on the American Southwest much loved by Herriman, where native icons like cactuses, buttes, joshua trees, pueblo houses, and kivas emerge from and vanish into the blank, fertile surface of the page, along with palm trees, giraffes, clocktowers, and Chinese laundries. As with images, so with words. The Kat’s dialect is synthetic, a seamless, be-bop blend of part-languages that evoke an array of Englishes, and becomes its own. “<small class="caps">oy</small>, ‘<small class="caps">ignatz</small>’.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> !!! <small class="caps">where four is thou</small>, <small class="caps">ignatz</small> ? [ . . . ] <small class="caps">oi</small>, <small class="caps">woi is me woi is me</small>” complains Krazy in a 1925 episode, when a seal unexpectedly flops by. “<small class="caps">my goo</small>-<small class="caps">niss sakes</small>, <small class="caps">l’il sill</small>—<small class="caps">widow goest thou at</small>?”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Kat is a creature of ineradicable sympathy, good will, and fun. In another episode, when Krazy finds a solitary coconut palm, s/he obtains balloons from a wandering salesman and uses glue, oakum, and paint to counterfeit “<small class="caps">a child coconut or two</small>” so the tree will be “<small class="caps">heppier with his lonesim sitiwation</small>” [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>].<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Here Herriman’s playful subversions of what Giorgio Agamben calls the anthropological machine are rampant.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The tree itself is paradoxically both suggestively anthropomorphized and insistently inhuman, having an uncanny appeal. Graphically, it has no animal/human features, so lacks the essential convention of living being in comics, according to Scott McCloud the basis of human identification, a face.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet when first introduced, its fronds are shedding iconic tears. The caption reads: “<small class="caps">with only the shifting sands</small>, <small class="caps">the dancing dunes</small>, <small class="caps">and the echoing cliffs of kaibito to keep him company a coconut tree grown to pulsating palmhood grieves for the parent grove in coconino</small>—<small class="caps">and silently sheds a modest nostalgian tear</small>.” The last attributes of modesty and nostalgia nudge us beyond animalization to human personification, but only precariously. In most panels following, we only see the tree’s inexpressive lower trunk (a perspective identified with Krazy in panel 7), while what we have been taught to recognize as its “head” is out of sight. There are two exceptions: (a) a central panel shows the balloon-coconuts just attached by Krazy, and a lack of teardrop icons implies that the tree is “heppier,” as four “coconut” faces now stare out from it; (b) Ignatz has chopped through the trunk to steal the coconuts while Krazy sleeps beneath, and the iconic tears reappear—but are these renewed tears of sorrow, or the more ambiguous “anxiety” icons also conventional to comics? (without a face, impossible to tell).<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The contrast between Ignatz’s selfish and objectifying view of the coconuts and Krazy’s generates the unexpected sentiment of the story: the tree need not be fooled by the fake coconuts for these surrogate children to have the value Krazy intends. The Kat has laboriously made them, produced them as “children” of his/her idiosyncratic activity and imagination, and given them to the tree as a gift; they embody Krazy’s relation to the tree, his/her sympathy for another, however inscrutable and ambiguous, Kokonino being, and the tree’s nonverbal response. This bond is emphasized in seven panels that show the Kat with head affectionately resting against the trunk. As the strip progresses, therefore, we are drawn away from the narrative problems to enjoy the birth in recognition (what is a tree without a face? what is a balloon with a face? what is a Kat, an animal, a human, an icon, a cartoon?) of unexpected lives and the bonds between them. Such bonds are not based on any universal mode of mutual identification, and the individual mystery of what is the Kat, the tree, or other res in the strip remains suspended in the pleasure of this discovery. This is allegorized when the balloon-buoyant tree floats a surprised Ignatz alone into the night, above the Enchanted Mesa that is home to Joe Stork, the bringer of all new lives to Kokonino.
    </p>
<p>
      This light-hearted story offers a modernist vision, attributed to Walter Benjamin by Agamben, of a “new in-humanity,” in which “the anthropological machine no longer articulates nature and man in order to produce the human through the suspension and capture of the inhuman. The machine is, so to speak, stopped; it is ‘at a standstill,’  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and, in the reciprocal suspension of the two terms, something for which we perhaps have no name and which is neither animal nor man settles in between nature and humanity,” such that “neither must man master nature nor nature man”: an experience of mundane beatitude whose icon is Krazy, rather than the egocentric Ignatz or the disciplinary Offissa Pupp.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> “<small class="caps">there is a heppy land</small>—<small class="caps">fur</small>—<small class="caps">fur away</small>,” sings a cheerful Kat, blending the ineffably utopian with the furry, lyrical here and now.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Felinomorphism and Plasticity</h1>
<p>
      In his/her idiosyncratic creatureliness, Krazy Kat, like the other felinomorphic res discussed above, conforms to the profound ambivalence expressed by Agamben  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and other recent writers who have considered modernity in the guise of a posthuman project whose shifting biopolitical exercises have rendered the human-animal distinction a mechanism variously emancipatory or oppressive. It is this ambivalence that Steve Baker registers in his analysis of the talking-animal comics genre itself, when he writes that because of the “instability of the anthropomorphized animal’s identity,” “the animal story’s invitation to pleasure is invariably an invitation to a subversive pleasure.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> I will here tie the modernist iconography (style) and iconology (symbolic condensations) of the Kat and other cat icons, both popular and avant-garde, to a growing modern awareness of and engagement with what H. G. Wells called the <span style="font-style:italic;">plasticity</span> of the human—to the deregulation of what it means to be human by the shattering of clichés of temporal progress and expanding civilization amidst unprecedented experiences of industrial, urban, technological, and military history.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> By deregulation, I mean the subjection of human/nonhuman distinctions to myriad contingent, competing, uneven powers in modern society, where the latter is increasingly conditioned by what Agamben, drawing from Foucault, calls biopolitics: the organization of “animality” or “bare life” under signs of economic necessity, security, and well-being.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> This theme is shared by high art storytellers such as Lawrence and Faulkner with popular fantasy artists like Herriman and Disney.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, where an iconography produces the fantasy of a totally mastered animality, an edenic or cyborgian paradise in which all lives are transparent to each others’ agencies and interests—as Sergei Eisenstein has brilliantly observed in his essays on Disney—the modern anthropological machine is fully operative, and the animal mask conceals a universal, indeed imperialist, re of the human. Where the fantasy is riven by stubborn, opaque differences and surprising, seductive transvaluations, by a creative humility before an inescapable heterogeneity of the animal and the inhuman—“I can’t go on, I’ll go on,” cries Beckett’s volatile, barely human “I”—then the machine is derailed, its anthropomorphic structures of feeling brought to a liberating standstill.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

      This last process belongs to what Armstrong concludes about modernist writers, who variously rebelled against what they perceived to be sentimental anthropomorphism in nineteenth-century ideology, and who used an animal primitivism to promote new structures of feeling about the animal in human life. This entailed a new assertion of animal distance and otherness—though one paradoxically assimilable as abstraction, programmed by primitivist thought and put to work for modernist self-creation, to envision a world of strangers to ourselves, to borrow Kristeva’s phrase, as well as to others. With the <span style="font-style:italic;">chiaroscuro</span> icon of the human-animal hybrid prowling in the foreground, what Agamben pictures on the most abstract scale as an indeterminate, obscure, ontological landscape of posthistory, I prefer to picture on the minor scale demanded by Foucault’s modern episteme, in which grand ontology collapses into the unique welter of biopolitical root systems from which modern times and places have grown. At this scale, contingent politics of class, race, sex, and gender are not transcended, but feed the ambivalence of plasticity, the local fears and hopes of biopolitical fantasy, self-consciousness, and agency. At this scale, the felinomorphic icon asserts its genetic composition in historical contingency, and especially, in a multiplicity and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> open-endedness in the human-animal environment, in which cross-sexual and cross- cultural meanings engaged with the lived worlds of the icon may be read.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Cat and Woman</h1>
<p>
      Artistic engagement with modern plasticity can be more or less progressive, more or less critical, even if it expresses radical changes in feeling. It may fuse conservative with emancipatory urges, fear with hope. Such is the historical knot of meanings, alternately grim and playful, of the Batman villain born in 1940, a year after Batman and in the first issue of his own comic book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Catwoman.</span> Batman, a superhero re created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger in 1939, is the first animalized superhero icon. Like his myriad spawn, he embodies that sovereign “state of exception” that Agamben links to the modern animalization of human life: he uniquely stands outside both the law and the human, in order to master the law and the human; he personifies an anthropological machine. What of Catwoman? When she first appeared, her reader was unlikely to be bothered by resemblances to Batman’s dark-haired fiançée, Julie Madison (or by Julie’s resemblance to another early villain, Dala).<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> They belong to a typage more important than individual personality: an idealized feminine body and face, fashion sense and manners proper to the early 40s, and also, independence and strong will, registering a nervous male fascination with modern women’s ongoing break from patriarchy. When Julie breaks up with Batman, she becomes an actress, performs in costume, and recreates her public identity as a celebrity with a new name (Portia Storme). Thus Batman’s own shadowy plasticity, his gothic shape-shifting in form and identity, is doubled in the light of day by this career woman. Catwoman will be another independent, woman professional in disguise. Wayne himself is a performer while not Batman: he pretends to be an <span style="font-style:italic;">ennuyé</span> socialite allergic to work. Asked at a party what he has been doing, he replies, “<small class="caps">nothing</small>, <small class="caps">jim</small>, <small class="caps">nothing. work is too strenuous</small>! <small class="caps">it bores me</small>!!” Jim thinks, “<small class="caps">bored</small>! <small class="caps">everything bores that fellow</small>! <small class="caps">if he ever got excited about anything i think they would declare a national holiday</small>!” while an onlooker comments, “<small class="caps">they say he is probably the laziest</small>, <small class="caps">most useless chap in our set</small>!”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Batman/ Wayne expresses the anxiety binding masculinity to work in modern America. He expresses both a fantasy of escape from masculine work as meaningless labour (in his Wayne persona, we admire his cool indifference to a busy world of commerce and crime, and indulge vicariously in a serene, wealthy lifestyle), as well as a fantasy of dedication to meaningful masculine work (a vigilante night shift that serves the community, expresses a male power not so securely available in “real” life, and lies outside the economy). Thus, while a modern apprehension of human plasticity expresses itself in new kinds of posthuman icons like Batman and Catwoman, such res are always embedded in symbolic chains articulating historical forces and changes.
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as Catwoman herself appears, she goes through several iconographic developments. One of the most important is her coming explicitly to double Batman: both as a “weird” creature of the night, shrouded in language of fear and mystery and depicted in purple and black shadow worlds, and as a persona obsessed with animal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> imagery and paraphernalia, a totemic being [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>].<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> That Catwoman does not settle easily into a costume (like the Joker, for example) is due to the explicit conception of her power as a shape-shifter, as a master of disguise. This is a salient feature of Catwoman in relation to comics form—for here the medium develops an icon who can preserve her identity between frames and stories, yet look utterly different, and often impossibly so. Until the 1950s, Catwoman had no “original” or “real” identity. Batman is Bruce Wayne in costume/disguise, but Catwoman for ten years has no real name or background story. In her first few years, she disguises herself in the roles of a maid, a fashion magazine editor, a society hostess, a beauty salonist, a newspaper writer, a rival fiançée for Batman, and more. Her range of faked public and private, work and leisure social identities suggests that she does not merely reflect misogynistic anxiety about the independent career woman (she does), but she also expresses an alluring fantasy of fluid transformation between such often competing realms: she can be it all.
    </p>
<p>
      Catwoman’s plasticity, like that of Batman, is most obviously expressed in her blurring of distinction between human and animal—her selection of a totem animal, and her identification with it, that mysteriously grounds her exceptional powers. The possibility that the human has no divine destiny or sanction, that it is a biological and historical construct, that it cannot be distinguished definitively from the animal, is expressed in fantasies that combine fear with pleasure. The human-animal divide is only the most traditional one in which to play out this fantasy, however. In comics, it is possible to go to the furthest limit of the human-nonhuman divide by marking a division between the recognizable or significant, the iconological itself, and its other—between the icon and its mere background. Catwoman is sometimes not only unrecognizable in disguise, she is also unremarkable as a re in the background, having no iconological status at all. In her first and second appearances, she appears as a tiny re, indicated by hardly more than a few quick lines, dwarfed by narrative and visual emphases elsewhere. From this insignificant background she will unexpectedly emerge as an icon—henceforth an icon of what remains outside iconography in comics, and what is outside the human. This micronarrative of emergence from the mise-en-scène of setting and style into character and agency illustrates, in nonverbal form, the modernity of the Foucauldian sign, its minor organic contingency, and the uncertainty of the human re itself. Catwoman’s face is a modernist version of Foucault’s ephemeral cartoon drawing in the sand—a human re at once obliging identification and defying mastery.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
      As a villain who is strictly non-violent, Catwoman more particularly offers the fantasy of identifying safely with transgression; this fantasy is akin to those offered by Batman and other superheroes, but inverted; not safe violence to others, but violence to property, and without recontainment by moral or institutional law. It is likely that such identification extends to male readers, and that such a cross-sexual identification process is assisted by Catwoman’s essential plasticity—a transgressive identification mirrored in the heterosexual comedy of Batman and Catwoman’s own mutual attraction. This attraction of doubles, veiled in mutual autonomy and mystery, offers a parallel to the twin, dark satellite relationship that Rupert and Ursula struggle to put into words and to live, like the cats whose nature they debate, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>. In mid-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> America, this avant-garde vision emerges in pulp fantasy: Batman and Catwoman circle each other endlessly, devotedly, barely known to each other, mastering each other’s mastery by force or sentiment. But where Lawrence’s characters can only connect in their leisure hours, Kane’s do so in their vocational lives. For the avant-garde Lawrence, the human is originally a question of culture, of how to think and represent its volatile modernity, whereas for the comics artist Kane, thought, feeling, and the problems of representation are reduced to telegraphic conventions, and the human becomes instead a fantasy of work, of what to do, and with whom.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Of Cats and Kin</h1>
<p>
      The alignment of the modern felinomorphic icon with woman, and the problem of learning a new kind of social bond, can be traced in the pulp genealogy of Kane’s Catwoman. In Mary Elizabeth Counselman’s “Cat-Woman” story in <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> in 1933 (with its uncannily coincidental bat-woman cover), the cat woman is a supernatural shape-shifter who compels desire and fear in the story’s male narrator. Yet like Kane’s Catwoman, she is harmless. She is only, in her human shape, a kind of foreigner whom the narrator befriends, and her tragic death seems to allegorize the intolerance and fear that villainizes the “other within” multi-ethnic urban life. But as a symbol, she exceeds that: I say a “kind” of foreigner because not only does she have no marked ethnic origin, but like Krazy Kat, her strange language (and Americanicity) remains indeterminate and may even be unique: “Her voice was a purring, throaty contralto, very pleasant, with a slight accent—not French, not anything I had ever heard.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Indeed, she seems to represent ethnic otherness that is endogenous to her urban English-speaking America—an internal plasticity—just as she represents the animal within the human. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Mules and Men</span> , Zora Neale Hurston presents a similarly didactic if more complex icon whose roots are in 1930s race politics yet also, in shortcircuiting the imagery of race and ethnicity, an icon that grows beyond them. After recounting Black American oral tales and experiences hearing these and learning occult hoodoo, Hurston closes her narrative with a tale of Sis Cat and Rat. Sis Cat catches Rat, who escapes by convincing Sis Cat that she should not eat without washing her face and hands, or she has no manners. But Sis Cat catches the Rat again, eating him first, explaining that she has “plenty manners,” and now “eats mah dinner and washes mah face and uses mah manners afterwards.” Hurston concludes the book: “I’m sitting here like Sis Cat, washing my face and usin’ my manners.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Here the civilized and the savage are introduced as conventionally opposed concepts. But this dualism fails to map directly onto conventional categories of race (or an animal allegory thereof): it is employed as a discursive pawn in a game of identity trickery and raw power between one anthropomorphized animal and another, the eater and the eaten, both indeterminately civilized, both ambiguously akin to the human. This biopolitical fable applies the argument of Hurston’s mentor in anthropology, Franz Boas, that culture is not a racial characteristic but a social development contingent upon history and geography, to a power conflict between two contending animals. Culture, and indeed any notion of human difference founded upon it, belongs to that human iconology that is drawn in the sand, and may be transformed and contested at flash points of social conflict, in this instance racial and sexual, in mid-century America.
    </p>
<p>
      Hurston’s fable shares the quality identified by Armstrong in modernism at large, of a rejection of sentimental relations to and among animals as a basis for identification or bonding. Yet like Rupert Birkin’s cats and other felinomorphic icons, they are sympathetic in another, perhaps ineffable way. (Lawrence can be moved, for example, after seeing the face of a dead puma, to feel that “in this empty world there was room for me and a mountain lion,” and to mourn the “gap in the world” its face has left, compared with “how easily we might spare a million or two of humans / and never miss  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a>) Sis Cat is a seductive re, but not assimilable to any clearly recognizable abstraction of the cat or the animal. Hurston’s voice, when she identifies with Sis Cat, assimilates a Black American oral dialect to the White literary form of her narrator, creating a unique synthesis. As the folktale universe of Sis and Brer anthropomorphic animals suggests, such a creature may be recognized as an imaginary type of kin. The pleasure of re-imagining modes of kinship among animals, as if free from a biopolitics of identity and difference from the human, is what seduces and binds. Such freedom requires the suspension of the anthropological machine, glimpsed again here as in Counselman’s story. This would explain the other outstanding instance of felinomorphic identification on Hurston’s part, when she relates her ultimate hoodoo apprenticeship ritual with Father Watson, known as the Frizzly Rooster: “He said to me, ‘You will do well, but you need the Black Cat Bone. Sometimes you have to be able to walk invisible. Some things must be done in deep secret, so you have to walk out of the sight of man.’”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> So Hurston passes the small white bones of a ritually killed cat through her mouth until she tastes the bitter one she will carry in order to walk, like a black cat, to one side of normal human knowledge and perception. The modernist paradoxically wishes to assimilate the insistent otherness of non-human nature to a renewed human life. But the imagined synthesis is not here, as in Krazy Kat and diverse res considered above, merely to regress to a primitivist abstraction; it is to produce the icon of a new modernity, a unique historical re that re-organizes reigning biopolitical categories in mid-century America of black and white, animal and human. Hurston’s title, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mules and Men</span>, undertakes the same subversive play. It refers to a tale that again short-circuits the biopolitical categories of race, the story of a mule who surprises its owners by talking back to them, refusing, like a defiant slave, to continue to follow orders and work. The humourous twist comes when the owner’s dog expresses the same surprise at the mule. The dog is identified with the owner, who runs away in terror, the faithful dog following him at every step.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> The talking animal appears both as a re of the Black man, a racist stereotype projected externally by White culture (but here seen as reasonable and seductive as Bartleby) and as an internal avatar of the White man himself. Such animal res are not interested in actual or individual animals in any direct sense, which is consistent with Armstrong’s other observation about modernism, that it depends upon abstracting the animal into types. But they are not simply primitivist either, and depend upon the historical associations of mules, men, and race in America to signify—as humour and as didactic subversion.
    </p>
<p>
      What the plastic animal icon teaches us, therefore, is that the modernist impulse, in diverse expressions across pulp and avant-garde genres, defied sentimental and anthropomorphic visions of the animal-human divide in significantly different ways. Not only or even generally did modernists produce a theriomorphic primitivism, an abstracting discourse that re-imagines the (human or non-human) identity of historically existing animals as timeless entities and values. However subversive and emancipatory of our understanding of the human, that project is one of Agamben’s anthropological machines in full operation, distinguishing the authentically human as a particular, self-reflexive relationship to animal otherness. There, the inauthentic human lurks not far away, ready  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to be pitilessly cast off as brute exceptions—as the Nietzchean herd that dies without leaving a gap in Lawrence’s world, or that masses itself in servile stupidity beneath Lovecraft’s individual spirit. More often, such primitivist abstraction worked to render that biopolitical machinery ideologically inoperative by imagining the new, possible identity of synthetic creatures that exist only in literary or graphic representation, but with historical and authorial production exposed, held together by style and circumstance.
    </p>
<p>
      Some common modernist icons expressed the fear of human-animal transformation or indistinction: the ape, the insect, the dinosaur. But of all animal icons, the felinomorphic trickster seems uniquely invented to express the tremendous desire simultaneously with the fear associated with the plasticity to which these modernist imaginations responded in their search for new structures of feeling for social kinship—and in so doing, unexpectedly combining the empowering magic with the obscure terror of walking “out of the sight of man.”

	  Lovecraft is singled out by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari as an exemplary writer of “becominganimal,” a concept that articulates the fluid ontology of plasticity I will develop in this essay, as well as its social determination of a kinship—just like that, according to Claude Lévi-Strauss, of the animal totem—of filiation or alliance rather than blood descent. Deleuze and Guattari are, like the modernists, not interested in the “real” animal, in the sense of a recognizable, categorizable type: “We fall into a false alternative if we say that you either imitate or you are. What is real is the becoming itself, the block of becoming, not the supposedly fixed terms through which that which becomes passes. Becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal become” (“Becoming-Animal,” selection from <span style="font-style:italic;">A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</span>, trans.

In Lévi-Strauss’s context (see Kalof and Fitzgerald, 268), blood descent refers to extended family systems, whereas in the modern age, it  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> may refer to race, and modernist animal icons of cross-racial or post-racial filiation, as I argue in this essay, have political significance.

Lovecraft’s imagination of an outsider poet and cat world <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> bond is also present for Ezra Pound. In 1928, W. B.

He knows all their histories—the brindled cat looked like a skeleton until he began to feed it; that fat grey cat is an hotel proprietor’s favourite, it never begs from the guests’ tables and it turns cats that do not belong to the hotel out of the garden; this black cat and that grey cat over there fought on the roof of a four-storied house some weeks ago, fell off, a whirling ball of claws and fur, and now avoid each other” (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Vision</span> [London: Macmillan, 1981], 5–6).

	  See H. G. Wells’s 1896 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Dr. Moreau</span>, as well as the Paramount 1933 film version, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Lost Souls</span>. The 1932 poster for the film foregrounds the sexy “Panther Woman” who is a creation of the renegade scientist, Dr. Moreau, and who ultimately kills him. The icon of metamorphosis without an original is suggested even here, where the mysterious cat woman is billed as one of the cast, without revealing the actress’s name. The earlier novel is where Wells develops his ideas about human plasticity in fictional form, and his Panther Woman is perhaps the archetype of the modernist felinomorphic icon; for his relevant journalism, see writings collected in Leon Stover’s edition, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Doctor Moreau: A Critical Text of the 1896 Edition, with an Introduction and Appendices</span> (Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co., 1996). Wells believed that the biological human being, as well as the psyche, had cut moorings in religion and cultural tradition that had stabilized definitions of the human, and that the coming modern age would be one that might create and recreate the human freely, for better or for worse. In the amoral Moreau, with twin roots in aestheticism and the will to power, Wells foresaw the darkest realization of genetic engineering and biopolitics. Wells borrowed the scientist’s name from the nineteenth-century painter famous for haunting animal paintings, especially the reknowned <span style="font-style:italic;">Oedipus and the Sphinx</span> , with its seductive yet terrible beauty, posing the riddle of “man” to the hero. Philip Armstrong has provided a perceptive, detailed reading of the animal in Wells’s novel in the context of his more optimistic socialist politics of the time. Further discussion may also be found in my forthcoming <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Animalism: Habitats of Scarcity and Wealth in Comics and Literature</span> (University of Toronto Press, 2011).
