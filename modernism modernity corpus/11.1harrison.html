I am sure that Julian Thomas's forthcoming book, <i>Archaeology
and Modernity,</i> is a fine and interesting study, but the
"abbreviated" version of its argument which he offers in the present
essay is, to this reader at least, a bewildering story of diverse
phenomena&#x02014;Renaissance humanism, British empiricism, Cartesian
foundationalism, Newtonianism, "social physics," Cuvier's comparative
anatomy, the rise of the nation-state, the advent of the museum,
the introduction of World War One military technologies, and much
else besides&#x02014;the concatenation of which somehow accounts for
the distinctively "modern" character of archaeology. Modern means
bad. It means atomization, reification and disworlding serial
classification. Perhaps that explains why the concatenation in
question works, in this "countermodern" telling, more according to
pre-Enlightenment principles of sympathy, correspondence, and analogy
than to the principles of causality, typology, and rationalization
that Saint Foucault associated with the epistemic ruptures of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Given the original sin through
which archaeology came into being as a discipline&#x02014;the sin of modern
objectivism&#x02014;it is guilty of reifying bygone human beings and using
them "as raw material for creating narrative processes." This is not good,
for by "reduc[ing] them [the people] to the atoms of a social system,
or to rational foraging organisms, we subject them to a totalizing
logic." Thomas has a logic of his own&#x02014;whether totalizing or not
is not for me say&#x02014;that leads him to infer that "this kind of
totalizing is close in spirit to totalitarianism." What else could it
be, given that it's modern? Conclusion: "If we find ourselves willing
to organize the lives of


<b></b>


people according to grand conceptual schemes" (as if Thomas's essay were
not an exercise in grand conceptualization) "we are that much more likely
to find it acceptable to do the same to people in the present." Beware,
then, of archaeologists!
<p>
I suppose part of the privilege (or license) of being "countermodern"
is that one can have it all ways: modernity atomizes, and thereby
totalizes. Modernity analyses, hence synthesizes. Modernity disworlds,
decontextualizes, renders the continuous discrete, yet at the same time
it integrates the diverse in grand conceptual schemes. The countermodern
tribunal does not acquit, it only condemns, for the terms of its
indictments change freely, though not randomly.
<p>
The most interesting part of Thomas's essay, from this reader's point of
view, is the section on "Depth and Surface." While most of the essay seeks
to show how archaeology devolved from a host of theoretical, practical,
social, and ideological forces we associate with modernity, here Thomas
gives archaeology some active agency in the story: "Archaeology was
integral to the development of this 'depth thinking,'" he writes,
alluding to the "depth models" (Jameson) that are the hallmarks
of modern thinking (the relationship between speech and grammar in
linguistics, infrastructure and superstructure in Marxism, authenticity
and inauthenticity in existentialism, the conscious and the unconscious
in psychoanalysis, etc.). That the excavations of archaeology may have
provided (at the very least) the metaphorical basis for these depth
models is a suggestion one hopes Thomas develops more substantially in
<i>Archaeology and Modernity</i>. Another thought-provoking suggestion in
this section has to do with how "the uncovering and recovery of hidden
deposits and artifacts is sometimes held in higher esteem than the
interpretation and appreciation of ancient things that are already fully
visible." The reasons for this devaluation of the visible in favor of
the hidden and buried belong to the dark underworld of modernity's will
to truth. That will to truth takes the form&#x02014;much exacerbated of
late&#x02014;of delving into the transphenomenal depths of the phenomenon
in order to bring to light what is shrouded in darkness, to wrest from
concealment that which, for reasons of its own, does not belong by nature
to the world of appearances. Much of contemporary science digs through the
humus of the natural world, of the body, of the biotic itself, in order to
uncover the underlying components of their elemental constitution. There
is more here than just a vague analogy between archaeology, science,
and a will to truth that forces both nature and history to yield the
secrets that lie buried in their depths. It is this unearthing of the
earth that more than anything else calls for thought today.
