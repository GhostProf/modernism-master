Of the many hostile reviews Gertrude Stein received in her lifetime, the award for Most Vitriolic would probably go to one written by Michael Gold. In 1936 Gold labeled Stein "a literary idiot," claiming that her work represents "an example of the most extreme subjectivism of the contemporary artist," and that it is on a par with "the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums." Stein possesses a "strong, clear, shrewd mind," and "was an excellent medical student, a brilliant psychologist," but her work looks, said Gold&#x02014;fine-tuning the theme of mental derangement&#x02014;"like the literature of padded cells in Matteawan." Only good Marxists, his review concludes, will properly be able to see through the "mystic irrationalities" that Stein's work represents: "They see in the work of Gertrude Stein extreme symptoms of the decay of capitalist culture" and "the same kind of orgy and spiritual abandon that marks the life of the whole leisure class."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Whether or not we agree with Gold about capitalist decadence, he is surely not the only reader to wonder whether Stein's work is an exercise in self-isolation. An association between "extreme subjectivism" and the experiments of early twentieth-century literature has been made by readers of all stripes, 

<b></b>

whether they are sympathetic to the modernist project (e.g., Marcuse, Adorno, Bloch) or more skeptical (e.g., Luk&#x000E1;cs, Daniel Bell). There are certainly reasons for seeing Stein's texts as even more "solipsistic" than those of her contemporaries. One of the characteristics of Stein's work, however, is the regularity with which it has been justified, by both Stein and her readers, as the very opposite of what such commentators imagine. Indeed, far from seeing in her writings "the most extreme subjectivism of the modern artist," Stein and her defenders have in fact frequently singled them out for their deeply <i>objectivist</i>, <i>realistic</i>, and <i>scientific</i> qualities. "Gertrude Stein, in her work, has always been possessed by the intellectual passion for exactitude," writes Stein in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
She has produced a simplification by this concentration, and as a result the destruction of associational emotion in poetry and prose. . . . [Poetry and prose] should consist of an exact reproduction of either an outer or an inner reality. . . . . 
<p class="blockquote">
	Juan Gris conceived exactitude but in him exactitude had a mystical basis. As a mystic it was necessary for him to be exact. In Gertrude Stein [by contrast,] the necessity was intellectual, a pure passion for exactitude. It is because of this that her work has often been compared to that of mathematicians and by a certain french critic to the work of Bach.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
To be sure, Stein is not the only early-twentieth-century writer to have seen herself in such terms. But given her background in experimental psychology and medicine, it is perhaps unsurprising that, more than with almost any of her contemporaries, the language of science is seen as an appropriate vocabulary to use in describing her work. What Luc Ferry says about the "hyperclassicism" of the twentieth-century avant-garde generally is especially true of Stein's work: it is "guided by the project of imitating a real," a "real" that, though no longer "defined as <i>order</i>," acts as "the artist's 'objective'," and that grants a "<i>scientistic</i> component" counterbalancing charges of obscurantist narcissism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   
</p>

<p>
What are we to make of such claims? In what follows, I want to explore some of these Steinian appeals to science and to ask what kinds of problems and pitfalls they potentially engender. My first two sections are an act of reconstruction, sketching, first, certain claims made by Stein and her admirers about the nature of her "experiments," and second, how these claims manifest themselves in her work. In sections three to five, I shall be casting doubt on many of these critical and authorial descriptions, and suggesting how we might justify Stein's enigmatic writings without dubious appeals to "exactitude" and mathematics. It is not hard to determine why an artist such as Stein would invoke science as a model. Given the prestige of empirical science in our culture, it is not surprising that ontological justifications for experimental art are sometimes associated with the sorts of investigations performed in the laboratory. But if the <i>attraction</i> of such associations is obvious, we as critics would be irresponsible if we did not ask questions about their <i>legitimacy</i>. Such questions have a deflationary dimension to them, but the goal of asking them is not merely negative. For the great interest of Stein's work is the way it forces us&#x02014;if we take her with the seriousness she 

<b></b>

demands&#x02014;to clarify and make explicit our understanding of meaning, interpretation, rationality, science, and the structure of moral personhood. At stake in Stein's work and the history of her reception is nothing less than the nature and possibility of humanistic inquiry.

To grasp the problems at stake, we need a sample text. I choose "If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso," written in 1923. To begin at the beginning:

<p class="noIndent">
My opening gambit, crucial to everything that follows, is this: whatever one thinks of Michael Gold's polemical assessment, we can at least understand why he thought such a text does not immediately&#x02014;the scare-quotes are his&#x02014;"make sense." The passage will in all likelihood be tougher to grasp for most readers than a comparably sized selection from a newspaper article, conversation over dinner, radio broadcast, history textbook, book review, or most other language-uses that we might encounter in the course of a given day. But what exactly is the challenge? Can we say, more precisely than Gold, how and why the going gets tough? As the subtitle suggests, the text is ostensibly a description of a human being rather than other entities Stein would have encountered daily&#x02014;her drawing room sofa, her pet dogs, passing clouds, Haussmann boulevards, and so forth. The question of how this initial assumption helps us with the rest of the text, however, is raised as soon as we encounter the first line: "If I told him would he like it. Would he like it if I told him." In light of the title, we probably feel compelled to assume that the "him" refers to Picasso, but what, we might be inclined to ask, is this "it" that he may or may not "like"? And why, if the syntax of the main clause indicates a question (in English), is the sentence completed by a period rather than by a question mark? And why is the sentence&#x02014;this time with the main clause preceding the subordinate clauses&#x02014;repeated immediately in the next sentence? Patient but eager for answers, we try to ignore this syntax and punctuation, and move ahead to line two: "Would he like it would Napoleon would Napoleon would would he like it." Again, we probably assume the pronoun "he" refers to the character identified in the title, since no one else has been offered as a possible antecedent. But then, if 

<b></b>

this is true, what is <i>Napoleon</i> doing here suddenly? Is <i>he</i>, not Picasso, the "he" who may or may not "like it"? Or is there a relevant resemblance, a metaphoric relation, being proposed between Napoleon and the painter? And why, furthermore, are the words so oddly strung together without punctuation, without the commas and other marks usually indicating the structure of a writer's thoughts? Few answers seem to be offered by the third paragraph, which is made up of five sentences asking, through various syntactical combinations, if "he" or "Napoleon" would "like it" "if I told him." By this point we might have started wondering what the speaker's stance is towards this mysterious "he." Is he or she being supplicant? Anxious? Obsessive? Or is the speaker simply being speculative, not seeking approval as much as information about "his" possible reaction to something? But after the third paragraph, the whole issue of Napoleon and his liking "it" seems to be promptly dropped with a single adverb: "Now." What should we do with this indexical? Is it meant as a spontaneous cry, akin to "Go!" shouted at the start of a foot race? Or is it more generalized, meaning something like "today" or "this week" or, more broadly still, "in our time"? Or perhaps it is modifying a verb&#x02014;"if I told him <i>now</i>," or maybe "would he like it <i>now</i>"? Venturing into the next two lines&#x02014;"Not now./And now."&#x02014;only seems to prolong the uncertainty, an uncertainty that is not cleared up in the two lines after that, which seem to introduce a whole new cluster of problems: "Exactly as as kings./Feeling full for it." What do kings have to do with Picasso? Why is "as" repeated? What "exactly" is "as kings," and how? How is the phrase "feeling full for it"&#x02014;whatever it means&#x02014;related to these kings or, for that matter, to anything else in the passage? 
</p>

<p>
With a bit of work and ingenuity, one could of course begin offering answers for all of these questions. But my interest here is ultimately less in any particular interpretation than in how one could begin to offer <i>any</i> interpretation, so it is important to move initially in slow motion, without losing sight prematurely of the genuine confusions into which Stein regularly thrusts her readers. To declare her work "subjectivistic," as Gold does along with many others, is to say that the kinds of interpretive questions I have posed about "If I Told Him" could be answered only by the author who composed the passage. "In a created thing," said Stein near the end of her life, "it means more to the writer than it means to the reader. It can only mean something to one person and that person [is] the one who wrote it."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  There is an irony here insofar as the portrait genre has always been characterized by a wish to describe or "capture" a person other than the one doing the portrait: the name hanging below the picture frame is the intentional object, the thing that it is <i>about</i>. Indeed, it is in this sense that Stein's portraits can particularly illuminate her work as a whole; emerging from a relatively well-defined genre, they allow us to recognize how Stein everywhere reorients the concerns of our ordinary language. Her project, we might say, is less about an intentional object in the world, less about some entity or state of affairs (the kind of entity mentioned in her title, for example), than about an intentional object in Stein's mind. To use a distinction she makes in connection to "Melanctha," her interest is less in "the realism of the characters" than in "the realism of the composition of [her] thoughts" (<i>PGU</i>, 16). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Another way of putting this would be to say that Stein's work is predicated on methodological solipsism: it assumes that psychological states do not presuppose the existence of individuals other than the one to whom the states are ascribed.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  "Nothing," she goes on to say in a particularly revealing comment, "can be the same to the other person. Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind; so why try? One can only enter into it in a superficial way. You have slight contacts with other people's minds, but you cannot enter into them" (<i>PGU</i>, 30). It is in part this methodological solipsism that led me to quote C&#x000E9;zanne at the head of my discussion&#x02014;C&#x000E9;zanne being the painter who as much as any artist ushered in a new sense of being "modern," whose influence on Stein is well-known, and whom, not coincidentally, she cites in her discussion of "the realism of the composition of [her] thoughts." The modern artist, C&#x000E9;zanne says in a passage Stein would have appreciated, must "see nature as no one has seen it before you," for art is a "personal apperception." But C&#x000E9;zanne's comment is illuminating in the present context because, in it, one can also detect the scientific aspirations that mark Stein's work. This is most audible in terms such as "optic," "logical vision," "sensation," and "apperception." It is not immediately clear what C&#x000E9;zanne means by these terms, but he obviously wants to suggest that such concepts will allow us to introduce a hardness and objectivity befitting our modern age. This slide between what is "personal" and what is "logical" may seem odd. And, as I'll ultimately be suggesting, such a slide <i>is</i> odd. But it is something like C&#x000E9;zanne's pithy description that we need in order to approach the scientific turn that Stein makes in her own writing.
</p>

<p>
Stein's scientific drive manifested itself early in her career in her commitment to a particular form of determinism, whereby the characters of <i>Three Lives</i> or <i>The Making of Americans</i> are portrayed as strict psychological "types." Even after drifting away from these early conceptions of character, however, she continued to maintain that her writing displayed a strongly scientific dimension. This manifests itself in a number of ways, two of which deserve particular attention.
</p>

<p>
The first instance of what Stein regards as significantly "scientific" in her work is what she often refers to as her resistance to both "remembering" and "resembling." The act of remembering and the perception of resemblances are intertwined, in Stein's view, because to place any single given object within a wider class of objects requires that the observer "remember" a range of other objects not necessarily before him or her. To see, for example, a particular <i>that</i> as a "table" or "chair" is to "remember" and to see "resemblances" between this <i>that</i> and other <i>thats</i> (other tables, other chairs) which we have seen elsewhere and at other times. This, for Stein, is to "misperceive" the object which stands before me, to "veil" the way reality in fact appears "immediately" before us. Even if two chairs are apparently identical&#x02014;the same wood, the same style, the same varnish, the same grain patterns&#x02014;they are nevertheless two and not one. They are "unique" things unrelated to each other or any other entities:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the making of a portrait of any one is as they are existing and as they are existing has nothing to do with remembering any one or anything. . . . You do see that there are two things and not one and if one wants to make one portrait of some one and not two you can see that one can be bothered completely bothered by this thing.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's friend Donald Sutherland once explained the idea this way: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
when she writes of unique immediacies and suppresses the generic element, one is always or nearly always tempted to puzzle it out, to induce or to restore a generic element which will make the composition "comprehensible." But immediate experience in its real immediacy is not comprehensible, has no meaning, and when you do induce a meaning you falsify the essential immediacy. Gertrude Stein once remarked, "What is strange is this"&#x02014;meaning that this thing as this thing is new and unfamiliar, as this thing it exceeds or comes loose from the class to which it belongs, from identification and identity so to say.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Sutherland's appeal here to "the real immediacy" of "immediate experience," and his remark about suppressing "the generic element," might be understood as a Steinian version of radical nominalism, casting doubt on "universals" and "abstractions" ("chairs," "tables") in the face of "concrete" empirical observation. Thus when Stein speaks, as she often does, of finding and describing the "essence" of a thing, the essence in question should be understood as something far from what the Aristotelian tradition believed. "Essence" for Stein is not what makes a thing a member of a class, but rather what makes it a particular, a token and not a type: what it is in its "immediate" <i>that</i>ness, without comparisons to&#x02014;thinking about, remembrance of, classification with&#x02014;other entities. Essence for Stein is what makes a thing <i>unlike</i> any generic kind, how it is that "each one is that one" (<i>LA</i>, 119).  
</p>

<p>
The second important way in which Stein thought of her work as "scientific" follows from this resistance to "remembering," and this is her commitment to what she calls the "continuous present," or, as she says opaquely in her <i>Lectures in America</i>, "living as we are now living as we have it and now do live in it" (<i>LA</i>, 104). As I understand her, Stein wants to say that the present moment is more "real" than the past or the future because it is more "concrete," more "alive," prior to the assumptions of past habits and conceptualizations. For Stein, one cannot step in the same river twice, and any description, be it of a person or object, is "falsified" the moment it is written: "Each time that I said the somebody whose portrait I was writing was something that something was just that much different from what I had just said that somebody was and little by little in this way a whole portrait came into being" (<i>LA</i>, 177). It is this conception of a "continuous present" that leads Stein to lose faith in conventional narrative. If what matters most is the "immediate" moment that makes reference neither to the past (previous events, previous classifications, previous meanings, etc.) nor to the future (where present phenomena supposedly run the danger of growing hypostatized), any sort of narrative will be an abstraction away from the way we "actually" exist, which is forever open and without definitive form. Clear teleologies, the kinds that link past to present or present to future, betray a na&#x000EF;ve (and, for Stein, patriarchal) conception of experience.
</p>

<p>
How these interrelated "scientific" aspirations&#x02014;a resistance to "resemblance" or "remembrance" and a commitment to the "continuous present"&#x02014;manifest themselves in a text such as "If I Told Him" should be clear. Certainly the text "resembles" no other 

<b></b>

written description ever given elsewhere of Picasso, including Stein's own "portrait," "Picasso," written fourteen years earlier. And it would certainly be difficult to identify unambiguously anything like an action or event or anything else that may be the seed of an ordinary narrative. Indeed, the text could be seen as an exemplary expression of what has been called Stein's "anti-memorialist stance."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  One sees, says Stein, "what one sees, the rest is a reconstruction from memory," and what is in need of recovery is "things seen without association but simply as things seen."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Only this kind of anti-memorialist <i>seeing</i>, Stein implies, provides us with genuine <i>knowledge</i>; any other kind of knowledge is merely second-hand. Hence the "scientific" significance of modern art, the best of which, as she writes in her study of Picasso, expresses "not things felt, not things remembered, not established in relations but things which are there, really everything a human being can know at each moment of his existence and not an assembling of all his experiences."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

II. Two Sciences?
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
As I noted at the beginning, Stein's background in experimental psychology and medicine has lent her self-explanations more legitimacy than comparable claims made by her contemporaries. Thus it is, for example, that some of the leading Steinians have been led to speak of "the intensely theoretical, 'scientific' approach to phenomena which characterizes all of her work," and the desire in her portraits "to come to know people, and to know them as a scientist," and how her "fabled obscurity" is in fact "an extreme form of <i>literalism</i>," a "function of what might be called her hyperrealism."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But an emphasis on Stein's "scientific" dimension brings us to an obvious impasse. For how can we possibly reconcile this commitment to scientific "exactitude" with the equally strong nonsensical quality of her writing? Recalling the remarks from C&#x000E9;zanne that I touched upon earlier, how do we harmonize a Steinian longing for both a "logical vision" <i>and</i> a "personal apperception"?
</p>

<p>
The key here lies in Stein's conception of what constitutes "science" and what it means to seek, as she says, "exactitude." This is the topic of a recent book by Steven Meyer which tries to examine, as his subtitle puts it, "the correlations of writing and science" in Stein's work. Stein's writing, claims Meyer, should be seen as part of an enterprise that he calls "Romantic" or "poetic" science, an alternative tradition of scientific "experimentalism" arising chiefly from dissatisfaction with Baconian empiricism. Other practitioners of this "science," he claims, were Emerson, William James, and Alfred North Whitehead, all of whom Stein admired deeply, and all of whom believed that the conventional explanations of empirical science, premised on the "reductive" assumption that nature is an extended physical mechanism, were unable to account for certain central features of human experience. Specifically, in its commitment to a third-person perspective, modern science forgets that our understanding of the non-human world is always shaped by our perceptions of it, that there is always something "more" left out of physicalist accounts of the world, and that "experience" is always "experienced" by "experiencing" subjects. In Meyer's account, "ordinary empiricism" 

<b></b>

requires "that one divorce the pursuit of knowledge from one's emotional investment in the procedures one has come to follow."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  "Poetic science," by contrast, "emerges historically as a corrective to what the poet-scientist perceives as the inadequacies of ordinary science," and is "vigorously nonmechanistic" and "non-Newtonian," focused upon the traces of human experience "already present in scientific knowledge, although scientists have chosen to ignore it" (<i>ID</i>, 21).
</p>

<p>
As with Stein's self-descriptions, Meyer's account of "poetic" and "modern" science raises a number of questions to which we will have to return. But it is worth looking first at his discussion of James and Whitehead, whom he rightly cites as being among Stein's most formative influences. His discussion of James focuses not upon James's pragmatism, but rather upon the late essays in so-called "radical empiricism." Like traditional empiricism, radical empiricism, as James described it, rejected the sort of aprioristic reasoning and "abstractions" characteristic of rationalism, but its conception of "experience" goes well beyond the conventional empiricist's focus on sense-data. For James, such sense-data might be enough for ordinary science, but human experience&#x02014;or "pure experience," as he called it&#x02014;exhibited a range of other phenomena that a reductive empiricist found no place for. Swimming amidst the streaming flow of "consciousness," the "blooming buzz of confusion," are not only the perceptions of colors and sounds and smells, but also the fantasies, wishes, emotional responses, mental associations, inclinations, and other distinctively human phenomena that accompany the raw percepts of the human mind. Whereas Humean empiricists, says James in a passage Meyer cites, had emphasized that objects perceived by the mind are actually "'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of connection,'" a genuinely radical empiricism, one that takes full heed of how we understand the world, "<i>does full justice to conjunctive relations</i>" (though not, of course, in the "peptonizing" manner of traditional rationalism). What Meyer refers to as the "composition of experience" (<i>ID</i>, 13) is revealed to us through what James called "knowledge by acquaintance." Unlike scientific and conceptual kinds of "knowledge-about," this is knowledge that we gain "immediately," by sheer perception of an object&#x02014;be that object observed "in the world" or introspected somewhere "in the mind."
</p>

<p>
Meyer's discussion of Whitehead focuses on a similar set of distinctions between two kinds of knowledge. In this case the contrast is between what Whitehead called "materialist mechanism" and "organic mechanism," a distinction that had begun to develop around the time of Stein's unexpectedly prolonged visit at the start of World War I (<i>ID</i>, ch. 4). "Materialist mechanism," in this picture, is the basis of modern science, and is uncompromisingly reductive. The world and all its entities, including human beings, are composed of molecules; and since molecules run blindly, human beings must also run blindly, without individual responsibility for the actions of their minds and bodies. "Organic mechanism," by contrast, admits the existence of molecules, but sees them as differing&#x02014;in Whitehead's words&#x02014;"according to the general organic plans of the situations in which they find themselves."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The principles of nature cannot be reduced to mere causality, as they also include "the concepts of life, organism, function, instantaneous reality, interaction," and the "order of nature." Much as James said of 

<b></b>

"knowledge by acquaintance," Whitehead suggested that such concepts are noticeable in "the things which lie around us," the simple immediate facts "that are the topic of interest" of ethics and poetry and not reducible to scientific kinds of cognition. Like James, he was looking for a way to keep mental life sounding legitimate, to preserve some space that causal description could not fully account for, and thus could not soil.
</p>

<p>
It is via this Jamesian notion of "pure experience" and this Whiteheadian idea of "organic mechanism" that we can begin to see how Stein could have understood her work as "scientific." She did not, it should be clear, have much interest for science as it is taught in laboratories; "naturally science is not interesting," she announces bluntly in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  What <i>was</i> "interesting" for Stein was an account of the special way in which human beings "experience" the world. "Experience" is a notoriously knotty&#x02014;some would say confused&#x02014;term. On the one hand, it usually refers to something immediate or incorrigible (&#x000E0; la James's "knowledge by acquaintance"), rather than "second-hand" or "reported" (&#x000E0; la James's "knowledge-about"). In this respect it is akin to "the given" sought by sense-data empiricists. On the other hand, it also implies something meaningful, information-bearing, with semantic content. It does not refer to the mere stimuli hitting one's "sensory receptors" (the flashing of light on a retina, the vibrations against an eardrum, etc.), but stands out as a rounded whole, an intentional unity that persists in the memory as a significance-bearing moment.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  To the degree that we all occupy different slices of space-time, to the degree that our individual mental associations do not always perfectly overlap, and to the degree that we occupy slightly different bodily structures with different phenotypes (nineteenth-century developments in biology were crucial to this way of thinking)&#x02014;to these varying degrees, we shall inevitably all "experience" (intuit, perceive, comprehend, grasp, etc.) the world in somewhat different ways. From here it is a short leap to saying that the "extreme subjectivism" denounced by Michael Gold and others is in fact as "objective" as any knowledge sought by traditional empiricism.
</p>

<p>
One immediate consequence of this search for a "science of the inner world," as we might call it, is that the first-person perspective comes to occupy the same privileged place that science ordinarily accords the third-person perspective. For it is here, the claim goes, that one is able to observe the buzzing mixture of concepts and percepts and emotions that, in James's words, makes up the "much-at-once," the "innumerable aspects and characters" of experience.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  It is not for nothing that James himself remained a resolutely introspective psychologist even as the behaviorist revolution loomed.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In Stein this privileging of the first-person perspective over the third-person emerges vividly in a passage from <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, where she describes the reception of "Composition as Explanation," the lecture she delivered at Cambridge in the mid-1920s:

Then up jumped one man, it turned out afterwards that he was a dean, and he said that in the Saints in Seven he had been very interested in the sentence about the ring around the moon, about the ring following the moon. He admitted that the sentence was one of the most beautifully balanced sentences he had ever heard, but still did the ring follow the moon. Gertrude Stein said, when you look at the moon and there is a ring around

There is, in this brief passage, little indication that the dean was himself some kind of scientistic ideologue. Indeed, far from dismissing Stein as a fool, he is even said to have admitted afterwards that her lecture "had been his greatest experience since he had read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason" (<i>ABT</i>, 222). But the dean does raise crucial questions about verification&#x02014;what role, if any, the concept of intersubjectivity plays in Stein's thinking, and how we should deal with novel ontological claims of the kind she routinely makes. Is there a difference between what there <i>is</i> and what there <i>seems</i> to be? Does the <i>appearance</i>, to me, of a ring around the moon, entail the <i>existence</i> and motion of such a ring? In responding to these questions, Stein explicitly asserts the reality of mental objects, be they accurate memories or misperceptions or drug-induced hallucinations or wayward fantasies. Among other things, this emphasis on the first-person perspective immediately casts doubt upon distinctions between <i>seems</i>-talk and <i>is</i>-talk: a ring can truthfully be said to "follow the moon," for that is how it appears to me as I reflect upon the nighttime sky. Faced with the sorts of questions the dean asks&#x02014;what we can say about a shared world, about things we might all be able to observe, and around which we might coordinate activities&#x02014;James himself could always fall back on his pragmatism: his perspectivism is tempered somewhat by a practical and post-Darwinian emphasis on adaptive behavior within an environment, on the utility of coordinating activities with others.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  But in radicalizing James's psychology, Stein makes it clear that the dean's problems are not the kind that interest her. Rings moving around the moon may not be the kinds of objects that conventional science&#x02014;"ordinary empiricism," as Meyer calls it&#x02014;will deem worthy of investigation. Their reality becomes apparent, however, when we recognize the validity of something like "pure experience" and "organic mechanism," which justify our positing of phenomena falling outside conventionally empirical boundaries. Moreover, literary texts, from this perspective, constitute a kind of new ontological record, documenting introspective reports and building them into the fabric of the world. Whether or not a Marxist reader such as Michael Gold would find such arguments persuasive is open to debate, but evidently Stein convinced not only herself of the cogency of her views. Even by the relatively conventional stylistic standards of the <i>Autobiography</i>, the final sentence of the passage quoted has a bluntness that suggests the extent to which the Cambridge dean, for one, found Stein's position unassailable: "he sat down."

III. Reasons, Causes, and Writing
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
I have already indicated at various points that Stein's claims are vulnerable to criticism, and it is time to take up some of the questions that up to now I have raised only in passing. As Coleridge said, we should not wish for an act of uniformity against the poets, and as thought experiments, Stein's work is undoubtedly illuminating. Rarely, 

<b></b>

however, does Stein ever rest content with thought experiments, and the statements she makes about her writing typically extend into claims about ontology, epistemology, and the course of history. As her commitment to "scientific exactitude" indicates, she is in the business of making truth-claims, of constructing theories and giving pictures that we are asked not merely to entertain but to endorse. We should not be afraid, therefore, to subject her views to scrutiny, nor to ask, in turn, whether the peculiarities of her writing arise from certain debatable philosophical assumptions.
</p>

<p>
By way of explaining my skepticism, I want to return to Meyer's description of Stein's literary projects, and particularly his claim that "poetic" science concentrates on parts of human experience that are "already present in scientific knowledge, although scientists have chosen to ignore it." The problem with this statement is its shortsightedness. Meyer writes as if scientific practices after Bacon and Galileo were founded upon a more or less arbitrary decision to neglect large parts of the universe, and as if scientific "reductions" were pursued merely for the cheap thrill of counting molecules and building fancy instruments. It is in some sense correct to say, as Meyer does, that modern scientists typically "divorce the pursuit of knowledge from one's emotional investment in the procedures one has come to follow" (<i>ID</i>, 11). But problems quickly arise. Not only does he say little about these "emotional investments" (are they like being in love? watching an exciting film? ting for one's country?), but he also says nothing about <i>why</i> scientists adopt the particular "procedures" they do.
</p>

<p>
These oversights become conspicuous when we consider how little interest "Romantic" science seems to have in what is one of modern (i.e., non-"poetic") science's most important tasks, namely prediction. From Meyer's perspective, "poetic science" is primarily a descriptive enterprise: the poet-scientist seeks to show how "scientific description becomes poetic and poetic description scientific" (<i>ID</i>, 48), and makes use "of the resources of poetic description in order to extend the domain of science" (<i>ID</i>, 22). In this, he can be said to be following Stein's own conception of science, which she claims to have garnered from her Harvard mentor: "When I was working with William James I completely learned one thing, that science is continuously busy with the complete description of something, with ultimately the complete description of anything, with ultimately the complete description of everything" (<i>LA</i>, 156). But whatever the origin of the idea, it is important to understand how impoverished a conception of scientific inquiry it actually is. After all, one hardly needs a scientific vocabulary simply to "describe" something. Every ancient Mesopotamian could give a description of the stars, the planets, the weather, light, anatomy, persons, animals, and so on; and, as I'll be suggesting, we continue to find a non-scientific idiom indispensable in our descriptions of many important phenomena, especially the behavior of human beings. One of the distinguishing features of modern science, however, is that, more regularly and precisely than our ordinary observations, its descriptions allow us to identify certain effects with certain efficient causes, and hence anticipate future phenomena. What makes science "scientific" is its nomological character: where there is causality, there is causal law, i.e., a hypothetically assumed general statement under which individual cases can be subsumed. And, despite the astonishing complexity revealed by post-Darwinian 

<b></b>

science (a complexity that James and Whitehead, among others, were eager to adapt), this interest in nomological patterns encompasses the whole of the natural sciences, even beyond the paradigmatic case of physics.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  As Bjorn Ramberg has written in a discussion of intentional versus non-intentional explanations, the special sciences are all characterized by "a certain homogeneity of interest," a "purely predictive aspect": "There is a sense in which we are not changing the subject by substituting one set of predicates for another in a science, . . . even if there's no reduction or prospect of reduction, as long as the switch is motivated by an attempt to better serve prediction in some domain, even a very loosely and tentatively characterized domain, where we change even our conception of the phenomena to be explained."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Laplacian aspirations occasionally voiced among modern scientists, in other words, arise not merely from the powers of "description" that empirical science gives us, but rather from the future events these descriptions allow us to foresee.
</p>

<p>
A first question to ask, then, when encountering claims about the scientific status of Stein's work, is whether texts such as "If I Told Him" could actually be used in the formation of general predictive hypotheses. And, put in these stark terms, one would be hard pressed to find a way to say that it could. In comparison to a sentence such as "This water just began to boil at one hundred degrees Celsius," it is not clear what Stein's line "Would he like it would Napoleon would Napoleon would would he like it" is <i>about</i> (a point I noted at the beginning of my discussion and to which I'll return presently), let alone whether it could count either as evidence for or against a hypothetical general statement. If we understood Stein's text as an "experiment," could we ever <i>repeat</i> it to see if we could achieve the same outcome? And what would ever count as an identical&#x02014;or, just as important, a different&#x02014;result?
</p>

<p>
This is by no means intended as a criticism of Stein per se; to question the idea that "If I Told Him" embarks on some importantly "scientific" procedure is not, in itself, to say that we should reject Stein's writing altogether. No literature is "scientific" in the sense I have just described, since the behavior of human beings&#x02014;the overriding concern for the vast majority of texts we call literary&#x02014;is in significant ways unlike that of planetary bodies, hydrogen molecules, and other entities whose behavior is very well predicted by nomological vocabularies. We should not expect portraits of persons to be as sharply predictive as scientific accounts of other phenomena, nor be disappointed when they fail to live up to such demands.
</p>

<p>
This of course only raises a new set of questions. Which aspects of human behavior make nomological accounts appear so inadequate? Why exactly are we entitled to this assumption about persons? And, if Stein's texts cannot, in Meyer's terms, make use "of the resources of poetic description in order to extend the domain of science," what might they be doing instead? What might literary texts be <i>about</i>, in light of what I've said here?
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, these are enormous questions, and we can only offer a sketch of a sketch here. But a starting point lies in our recognizing that the understanding of a person's behavior typically invokes a range of mental states&#x02014;belief, desire, motivation, intention, hope, hatred, and so on&#x02014;that are without any exact parallel in the natural 

<b></b>

sciences. Another way of putting this is to say that understanding persons is typically interested in the investigation of <i>reasons</i> or <i>justifications</i> while explanation of non-persons is typically interested in the investigation of <i>causes</i>. Both reasons and causes can be invoked in response to the question of "Why?," but they answer why-questions through vastly different means. A good account of, say, why an earthquake occurs or why a pill dissolves in water requires no reference to what the tectonic plates "want" or what the capsule "thinks." Though the capsule and the tectonic plates are, in Ramberg's phrase, in practically different domains (examined by different kinds of scientists looking at quite different kinds of phenomena), their behaviors are equally well-captured by nomological explanations. But a good explanation of&#x02014;to take a mundane activity that Stein doesn't (or doesn't seem to) discuss in "If I Told Him"&#x02014;why Stein opens the refrigerator door does invoke mental terms: she "wants" some orange juice and "thinks" there is still some left in the container. Unlike a physical explanation, this account of Stein's actions requires that we ascribe motivations and understand how these motivations and purposes cohere with the rest of her beliefs and desires. If she is being rational&#x02014;"rationality" here being a generalized term for non-randomness, the minimal coherence of one's beliefs and desires&#x02014;then Stein opens the refrigerator when thirsty because she believes that doing so will allow her access to the juice container; because she believes the juice will slake her thirst; because she believes the juice is there on one of the shelves rather than, say, under her bed; because she believes the juice will do no greater damage to her (it isn't poisoned); and so on.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  We might even go on to give psychoanalytic accounts of Stein's action: "because opening the fridge allows her, unconsciously, to repress traumatic childhood experiences." This would of course be to stretch the range of possible rationalizations, but nevertheless would still be reason-giving explanations, in the sense of providing justification rather than identifying causation. (A point Freud himself often obscured.)<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Such accounts resemble scientific accounts in that they help us explain and predict&#x02014;they help us say why Stein did what she did and anticipate what she will do next&#x02014;but unlike scientific accounts, they are concerned as much with final causes as with efficient causes. They predict events not nomologically, but relative to evidence pertaining to prior action. There would be no efficient way to reduce even the simple state of wanting to open a fridge to a formula under which one could subsume other individual actions. "Wanting" to open a fridge is not a discrete "mental state": there are innumerable ways such "wanting" can be expressed. (This is even more true in the case of "wanting to visit a friend" or "wanting world peace.") In practice, thousands of years of wondrously complicated evolution mean that such step-by-step rationalizations are routine for us. Indeed, the shock we experience when rationalization <i>is</i> a struggle&#x02014;the Monty Python tobacconist trying to cope with an unwittingly lewd Hungarian visitor, the spouse struggling to understand a mumbling partner drifting into Alzheimer's, or, indeed, the reader encountering "If I Told Him" for the first time&#x02014;is testimony to the efficiency and power of our ordinary interpretive strategies.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of the interpretive position I am sketching here will emerge more fully in the course of our discussion. But we are now at least prepared to take an 

<b></b>

initial step towards answering the general question, raised a moment ago, about what literature might be said to do once any scientific pretensions&#x02014;Steinian or non-Steinian&#x02014;have been exposed as misguided. Literary texts may lack the kind of predictive power that nomological accounts have, but they are exceptionally good at providing thick descriptions of the particularly human phenomena I have been describing here: the ascription of beliefs, desires, thoughts, hopes, hates, and other capacities of mindedness that are necessary for understanding persons within a given environment. The opening of a refrigerator door is ultimately a rather mundane action. But texts we call literary are notable for their ability to display scenarios which, for sheer complexity and realism and drama, far outpace even the most imaginative and carefully crafted philosophical thought experiment. It is this kind of descriptive endeavor that Iris Murdoch describes when she calls literature an indispensable "education in how to picture and understand human situations."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  I assume most serious readers would agree with Murdoch's remark. Wherever one's theoretical or political sympathies may lie, one presumably wouldn't bother with literary texts in the first place if one didn't think that, in one sense or another, they might help us better grasp how persons act within and respond to particular human situations. "Human": it is difficult to see how (e.g.) a novel could be written about (e.g.) a plant's photosynthesis&#x02014;unless, of course, the plant's cells were thoroughly personified and its mechanical processes metaphorically redescribed as moral dramas.

<p class="noIndent">
If, then, we take Murdoch's term "human" to designate the capacity to give reasons and justify actions, and if, as I've been saying, our concern with Stein's texts cannot be first and foremost in its explanation of causes, what <i>are</i> we doing when we read a text as intransigent as "If I Told Him"?
</p>

<p>
One way to begin addressing this question is to make explicit a feature of so-called "Romantic" or non-mechanistic "science." What characteristically motivates this line of thought is a belief in special sorts of inner processes, processes that themselves evince a teleological character. Whatever the differences between James's "pure experience" and Whitehead's "organic mechanism" (and here one might also think of <i>&#x000E9;lan vital</i>, <i>der Wille</i>, <i>Erlebnis</i>, and other similar locutions from the turn of the last century), they can each be said to rely upon what are sometimes referred to as "sub-personal systems." A sub-personal system refers to a theory which proceeds by breaking down a person into an organization of subsystems (organs, routines, nerves, faculties, components, atoms, ids, egos, etc.) and attempting to explain the behavior of the whole person as the outcome of the interaction of these subsystems.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In contemporary debate the term is used to describe cognitive theories of consciousness, which typically see the mind as a computer-like engine propelling a person as a whole into thought and action. But as the examples of organs and atoms suggest, sub-personal descriptions can come in many different varieties, depending on where we turn our spotlight. And what I am suggesting here is that a version of such sub-personal descriptions characterizes an important 

<b></b>

segment of early twentieth-century thought. James and Whitehead would of course have been horrified by the idea that minds could be modeled on something as lifeless as a computer program. But if their own conceptions of mindedness emphasize fluidity and <i>dur&#x000E9;e</i> rather than the "mechanical" mental processing favored by contemporary cognitivists, they deserve to be called sub-personal systems in the sense that they locate the meaning of a person's "outer" behavior (speech, action) in something "inside." What matters most for our understanding of an individual person is not his or her ("mere") behavior, which occurs in a public setting and which can be interpreted accordingly by any third-person observer, but rather our ability to gain access to what goes on "inside," the mental arena of which actions are only the "outer" manifestation.
</p>

<p>
It should be relatively clear how the concept of a sub-personal system is pertinent to Stein. Indeed, the entire discussion of her so-called "subjectivism," with which I began, could be understood as a sketch of her obsession with the sub-personal level; it was this obsession that allowed us to identify her with methodological solipsism. Stein lacks a technical-sounding term for this sub-personal quasi-entity, but some words that come close are the simple terms "inner" or "inside," which are evident not only in her interview remarks about the impossibility of "entering into" and having "contact with" someone's "mind," but also throughout her descriptions of her work. "I had to find out what was inside any one," she says of her portraits, "and by any one I mean every one I had to find out inside every one what was in them that was intrinsically exciting" (<i>LA</i>, 183). <i>Three Lives</i>, she says, was "concerned with seriousness and the inside of things," a description of "the inside as seen from the outside" (<i>ABT</i>, 147). Faced, then, with a text as abstruse and enigmatic as "If I Told Him," we are encouraged to trace its words back to Stein's "inner" mental processes, be they the aural associations or memories or fantasies or something else "inside" caused by interaction with the text's ostensible subject (e.g., Picasso).
</p>

<p>
It was this quest for the "inside" that led Kenneth Burke, a critic who anticipates many of the questions I have raised here, to caricature the Steinian formula this way: "You will talk much about getting 'inside' things . . . . And since you, as an <i>outsider</i>, are busied with the literary task of describing things until you get <i>inside</i> them, there will necessarily hover about your theories some hint of mystic communion."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Implicit in Burke's remark is a recognition of the complex ways in which the sub-personal level of description actually presupposes the <i>personal</i> level&#x02014;presupposes, that is, the domain of publicly observable human bodies and behavior where we originally learn to apply the concepts that allow us to say things about ourselves, ascribe content to our utterances, and posit "inner" entities such as "thoughts" and "souls."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  To see sub-personal systems as the "ground" of meaning for a person's language and behavior is to endorse an essentially <i>internalist</i> conception of meaning. In claiming, that is, that "Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind," Stein is describing beliefs&#x02014;her belief, for example, that a ring follows the moon&#x02014;as something utterly private, something that she but nobody else can "have" or "possess." But how, we should ask, does Stein know that her mental image is specifically that of a <i>ring following the moon</i> rather than that of, say, a <i>snake leading the sun</i>? To appeal to inner ideas, representations, 

<b></b>

images, words, etc. is only to beg the question of where <i>those</i> ideas, representations, etc. got <i>their</i> meanings. Images and pictures "in the head" are no more intrinsically meaningful than images and pictures in the physical world. Stein's belief that a ring follows the moon may be incorrigible; she could not be mistaken about her having the belief in a way that I, as an onlooker, could. But the <i>content</i> of her belief cannot be "private" in the sense that nobody else could ever grasp it. Thinking depends upon the kinds of fine-grained, normatively sustained distinctions&#x02014;distinctions between <i>rings</i> and <i>snakes</i>, <i>following</i> and <i>leading</i>, <i>moon</i> and <i>sun</i>, and so forth&#x02014;that only language can provide. And the habits and norms and grammars of language are publicly endowed. They are learned within a particular social setting, and are thus open to the scrutiny of third-person observers.
</p>

<p>
To say that sub-personal "insides" do not mean anything on their own is to say that purposes are evinced not by some inner process or "experience," but by the behavior of the person as a whole within a given environment, and it is this behavior that is the starting point for the discrimination of meanings. Such a criticism of Steinian-style private worlds does not entail radical behaviorism.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  But it does mean that the ontological status of our mentalistic terms is less definite than it is for Stein and her philosophical counterparts. These items become, so to speak, less easily locatable, less something <i>in</i> the person than something <i>between</i> persons. Thoughts and beliefs and desires, that is, are things we ascribe to entities&#x02014;e.g., to each other&#x02014;whose behavior is so complex that nomological descriptions are incapable of picking out many salient patterns. If, to return to our familiar example, we see an entity moving near the refrigerator, we might be tempted to begin with some physical descriptions: "it's the broom pushed along by the wind," or "it's the kitchen table moved by the gravitational pull of the moon." But because these accounts will probably seem far-fetched in light of our other beliefs (brooms don't usually open refrigerators, etc.), and because the entity's behavior is relatively complex (with what seem to be "facial expressions," etc.), we will soon resort to descriptions invoking mental states. Stein's opening the refrigerator door is more efficiently explained when we introduce a vocabulary of intentions; and in the event of more complicated activities, such a vocabulary would quickly be recognized as indispensable. To rationalize the behavior in this way does not require that we access her "inner world," but rather that we see the bodily motions in a certain light, as part of an arc of action directed to some goal.
</p>

<p>
Given, then, that the explanatory power of appealing to sub-personal systems is constrained by the accounts we give at the level of the person, the level of publicly learned norms of meaning and grammar and intentional ascription, an important point about Stein's work is worth making. Whatever else she is doing, and whatever else she may say about herself, her failure to make obvious sense does not arise because she is "actually" describing something "basic," "fundamental," and "immediate" to which our conventional syntax and semantics ordinarily block access. If meanings are fixed by an ideal interpreter rather than something uniquely in the head, then <i>there is no "basic" level "underneath" for us to get to</i>. There are, that is, no sub-personal events "in" Stein that <i>mean</i> independently of what she would have learned at the level of the 

<b></b>

person, and no sub-personal processes that she herself could pick out without presupposing the distinctions present in the shared practices of our public language. And as Burke suggests in the same review I cited a moment ago, the very operability of such distinctions means that "remembrance and resemblance are inevitable"&#x02014;i.e., thinking without norms, without grammar, without reliable distinctions between certain types of entities and actions and events, would be not be thought, but empty noise.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  To be sure, we often encounter things or events that induce us to ask, "What's <i>that</i>?" But that which is unfamiliar can only be picked out against a vast backdrop of what <i>is</i> familiar, what we <i>already</i> can classify according to "resemblances" and with the help of "remembrance." In their quest for "the given," sense-data empiricists sometimes used to suggest that grunt-like perceptual reports along the lines of "Red square there now" were somehow more "basic" than grammatical sentences, as if one could pick out different colors (<i>red</i> rather than <i>blue</i>, <i>green</i>, etc.), shapes (<i>square</i> rather than <i>circle</i>, <i>amorphous blotch</i>, etc.), places (<i>there</i> rather than <i>here</i>, <i>on Jupiter</i>, etc.), and times (<i>now</i> rather than <i>next week</i>, <i>in the Renaissance</i>, etc.) without a language. Stein, we might say, gives a vitalistic version of this empiricist effort, a version that readers such as Steven Meyer treat all too uncritically. The "given" she seeks to describe may include, as Meyer vaguely puts it, "emotions" as well as objects in the world, but the syntactical breakdown in her work suggests the same kind of misguided search for something perceptually "basic" or "primitive" lying beneath the classifications of a fully developed, more or less coherent language.

Keeping these considerations about sub-personal systems in mind, then, the final question we need to face is whether or not "If I Told Him" is therefore merely babble. Can we discern <i>no</i> thinking that must have gone into it and other Steinian portraits? Are Stein's portraits no better than a linguistic random-number generator? Stein of course spent a long time in crafting her texts, sometimes months. What, then, could she have been doing all that time if her texts are simply akin to an infant's rambling mutterings? And what reason is there for us, in turn, to continue reading her texts at all?
</p>

<p>
Earlier in my discussion I described the kinds of confusion into which a reader of "If I Told Him" is led: pronouns without clear antecedents ("he," "it"), ill-defined indexicals ("Now"), unexplained references that may or may not be metaphors ("Napoleon"), ragged syntax and odd punctuation ("Would he like it if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him"), obscure pseudo-similes ("Exactly as as kings"), eccentric repetition ("If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if I told him if I told him if Napoleon . . . "), and so forth. An important point needs to be made here. Given what I have said already about the situational nature of interpretation, about the ascription of meaning within a particular socio-linguistic environment, it should be clear that terms such as "odd" and "eccentric" are meant to be relative&#x02014;relative, that is, to us and to our ordinary ways of understanding speakers of modern English. When confronted with novel stimuli, whether of speech or behavior, our starting point 

<b></b>

is always our own previous experiences in making sense of persons, our own previous intentional ascriptions. To someone who finds this idea hopelessly ethnocentric, one can only ask: What other starting point <i>could</i> we take up? And besides, beginning with one's own beliefs does not mean <i>remaining</i> with one's beliefs, or that one's set of beliefs are a self-enclosed set of entities. With a modicum of effort, one can always adjust one's beliefs to accommodate a new situation, and often our very survival demands that we do just that. If our initial impulse is to seek salient patterns in the places we usually find them, our experiences in dealing with the varieties of human behavior usually allows us to cultivate the wit and wisdom that, as Donald Davidson describes in a well-known discussion of Miss Malaprop, let us cope with strange talk and odd behavior.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  To say that "If I Told Him" is eccentric and odd is not, then, to invoke some metaphysical standard of sense, or even to deny that such language-use could become, with some changes in the syntax and vocabulary of modern English, as ordinary as chit-chat about the weather. It is, rather, to say that the text breaks <i>our</i> normal expectations, the expectations <i>we</i> have accrued in our experience as language-users. Indeed, in this respect Stein goes well beyond Miss Malaprop, whose mistakes are at least regular enough that we can learn to translate them into more familiar expressions, ask how they contribute to the truth-conditions of a sentence, and place these sentences in a logical relation to other sentences as we always do. We could learn to replace "derangement" with "arrangement" and "epitaphs" with "epigraphs," and draw the appropriate inferences from there. But with Stein it is not always easy to see how we could translate her idiosyncratic speech into something more familiar.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Stein's diction is almost always comprehensible, as critics often note when praising her supposedly "American" attention to the ordinary things of the world.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  But at first glance&#x02014;that is, doing what we normally do, seeking the kinds of sentential patterns that we are accustomed to seeking in language-like marks and noises&#x02014;the way these simple words are combined into sentences is deeply obscure.

Indeed, even if we know already that the intentional object of "If I Told Him" is primarily Stein's thoughts rather than Picasso's person, Stein's expressions are so resistant to being organized into easily intelligible sentential patterns that it is difficult to know even what is being stated about her response to the famous painter. The contrast between "If I Told Him" and my simple description of Stein opening the refrigerator in search of orange juice could not be starker. Identifying the content of my description ("Imagine someone opening a refrigerator . . . ") is as unproblematic as my own ascription of content to Stein's action ("She wants something in the refrigerator"). But with Stein's text, the case is obviously much different. Beyond its title, in fact, it is not even clear that Picasso, rather than another of Stein's famous friends, or for that matter anything else, has initiated this catalogue of words. It is not immediately self-evident what would change if the title of the text referred not to Picasso but to, say, Matisse&#x02014;or to her pet dogs, or to passing clouds, or to Haussmann boulevards.
</p>

<p>
But to point out these various confusions is not to say that one could <i>never</i> make <i>some</i> sense of Stein's work, or that one could never find <i>any</i> patterns in her sentences. Indeed, many people have. Again, knowing that Stein is not herself as childish as her 

<b></b>

work sometimes appears&#x02014;even Michael Gold confessed that she has a "strong, clear, shrewd mind," "was an excellent medical student, a brilliant psychologist"&#x02014;we can safely assume that she is up to something special in what seems an otherwise nonsensical text. We should assume that the speaker shares most of our beliefs about the world, and then begin looking for other kinds of patterns that might suggest something.
</p>

<p>
This practice of looking for alternative patterns beyond those of ordinary language is familiar to readers of early twentieth-century literature, who are accustomed to facing texts that, at first glance, often show little sign of having been shaped by a conscious artist. For some early readers, a good interpretive strategy seemed to lie in identifying what was called "spatial form," which pictured a text as a montage of repeated "images," recurrent descriptions of objects and states of affairs from which we can infer some kind of larger meaning.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In the case of Stein's portraits, however, the search for "spatial form" at the level of imagery is bound to be disappointing, for the confusion initiated by her texts arises at a different, and more basic, level than in the texts of her contemporaries. Pound's <i>Cantos</i> and Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, for example, are famously "fragmented." But unlike with Stein, the fragments that constitute these texts are line- and stanza-sized, and the challenge for the reader is to find out whether, and how, these lines and stanzas are interconnected. It is relatively clear, for example, what state of affairs is being described in the lines, "I sat on the Dogana's steps/For the gondolas cost too much, that year" (<i>Canto</i> III, ll. 1&#x02013;2) or "Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee" (<i>The Waste Land</i> l. 8). And similar things could be&#x02014;and have been&#x02014;said about narrative texts: the patterning of imagery in, say, <i>Nightwood</i> or <i>As I Lay Dying</i>. But, again, it is considerably less clear what is being described in the line, "If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon." Whereas an Eliot or Pound text typically loses sense <i>between</i> descriptions, sense in Stein's portraits is lost, as it were, <i>within</i> descriptions, so that the aboutness of the quasi-sentences is never allowed to materialize. This presents a much different set of problems for the reader. Coming away from Pound and Eliot, we can recall vivid, if brief, scenes: the Browningesque speaker looking over Venetian canals, the German countess recalling her youth. It may be unclear how these scenes relate to others in the text, but in themselves the descriptions are more or less coherent, are intelligibly <i>about</i> something. But in the case of Stein, no intentional object emerges. There are no "images" for us to link "spatially."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
With conventional images and descriptions of scenes or characters not immediately available, many readers have accordingly sought other means of finding patterns in Stein's language. One strategy has been to locate what is sometimes referred to as Steinian "sound patterning." This is the strategy, for example, of Marjorie Perloff, one of Stein's most sympathetic readers, when she tries to link Stein's work to that of Wittgenstein. For Perloff, the patterns of sound in a phrase from <i>Tender Buttons</i> such as "Roast potatoes for"&#x02014;the repetition and inversion of "o-r," the assonance of the repeated "a"s and "o"s&#x02014;show how Stein breaks up our conventional syntax "not out of a refusal to 'make sense' or a predilection for pure nonsense, but because she wants to draw out specific semantic implications not normally present" in ordinary discourse about food. Thus in the sixteen-letter phrase "Roast potatoes for," Stein uses only seven 

<b></b>

phonemes, and the "simplicity" of this might be said to suggest the "simplicity" of the roast potatoes themselves, which, as Perloff points out, is "everybody's food." Stein's experiments, in other words, are not a means of being eccentric, but, more profoundly, "a way of testing the limits of language." Perloff does not discuss "If I Told Him," but if she did, she could similarly point to the music of the text's repeated groups of sounds and words, and probably identify "semantic implications" not otherwise self-evident. The chiasmatic structure of line one, the near-rhyme of "if I told him" and "Napoleon," the short round "o" of "would" and "told" and "Napoleon," the conclusive "d" echoing in "would" and "told": read in Perloff's resourceful way, these and other features might be said to evoke the geometrical idiom of Picasso's Cubist phase, with its interlocking planes pieced together into portraits of friends and lovers. If we think of Stein as taking part in what Perloff calls, following Wittgenstein, a "poetry game," then we could even say with her that the curious locutions of "If I Told Him" make "rather good sense."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
From one point of view, then, it does seem eminently possible to beat back nay-saying critics: if by "make sense" one means "exhibiting salient patterns rather than mere randomness," Stein's texts can indeed be said to fit the bill. Three important points need to be made here, however. The first is that, despite Perloff's remarks about the "semantic implications" of Stein's work, making sense of it by pointing to "music" in fact does little to add any particular semantic content to it. Perloff's description of the aural effects of "Roast potatoes for" are sharp&#x02014;the "o-r" is indeed repeated and inverted, and there is indeed assonance in the places she claims. But when a critic tries to move from this kind of observation to some more general claim about what such a pattern means, he or she begins to sound suspiciously like an astrologist interpreting the alignment of the stars. Why should the acoustics of "Roast potatoes for" evoke <i>the simplicity of roast potatoes, which is everybody's food</i> rather than anything else&#x02014;say, <i>the unhealthiness of a starch-heavy diet</i> or <i>the monotony of eighteenth-century Irish peasant life</i>? If we are appealing to associations rather than norms, then my preference for these and any other way of reading "Roast potato for" would be no more impermeable to doubt and criticism than my preference for chocolate ice cream over vanilla. Drawing a connection between the sounds of "Roast potatoes for" and the supposed universality of potato-eating strains credulity in large part because identifying what a text suggests is not the same as identifying what it means. To talk about sound patterning, in other words, is not in itself the same as identifying semantic patterning. Again, as with my references to ordinary and non-ordinary language, drawing distinctions between "meaning" and "suggestion" is not equivalent to making metaphysical appeals: "meaning" here can refer simply to our habitual, normative ways of ascribing content to marks and noises. But even when we demythologize meanings in this way, it is important to keep in mind how little semantic stability music and other sound patterns have in and of themselves. The uses of words are so regular that we can easily teach them to our children, laugh at puns, play crossword puzzles, and compile dictionaries. But it is hard to imagine how we could ever stabilize, to the same extent, the effects of a melody whistled in the shower or heard at the symphony. Such melodies may carry associations&#x02014;a piece 

<b></b>

may remind one of something from childhood or may be associated with a particular political regime&#x02014;but these associations in and of themselves are not inter-subjectively stable enough to act as norms on a par with linguistic ones. Pace critics who read all human artifacts as "texts," patterns such as those heard in music are content-poor in comparison to those of sentences. Once again we recall a remark by Kenneth Burke, himself both a music and a literary critic, who in a 1923 review of Stein's <i>Geography and Plays</i> remarked that Stein is blind to the very medium in which she works: "if the musician plays G-sharp he has prescribed no definitions; but if the literary man writes 'boy' he has already laid down certain demarcations."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Whatever Perloff might assert, "specific" is precisely what the effects of Stein's "sound patterning" is not. The fact that music is not sheer noise does not mean it is therefore a language.
</p>

<p>
The second problem with Perloff's description is the way this difficulty of determining the semantics of "Roast potatoes for" drastically weakens any connection between Stein and Wittgenstein. To emphasize the priority of music over conventional semantics in Stein, Perloff invokes a passage from the <i>Investigations</i> where Wittgenstein compares the phrases "Bring me sugar" and "Milk me sugar," and she rightly notes that the nonsense of the latter phrase, just as in Stein's texts, is not metaphysical but practical: it has been "withdrawn from circulation" for specific reasons, and can still manage (like the musician playing G-sharp) to have an "effect." But in discussing Wittgenstein's examples of nonsense&#x02014;examples that indeed seem to evoke Stein&#x02014;Perloff overlooks one of Wittgenstein's reasons for bringing them up in the first place: namely, to shed light on the various ways in which we often <i>are</i> able to make sense and discriminate semantic patterns, in the most everyday cases. Wittgenstein was indeed concerned to guard against "subliming" our logic and language, and was indeed anxious to point out the historical character of our sense-making practices. But he was just as concerned to emphasize the normative role that these practices continue to play for us, despite their not having any transhistorical metaphysical status. As I observed above, Stein tends to see her work as somehow a transcription of her actual "inner experience." The nonsense of her text is designed to be a truer picture of our "underlying" mental life than anything provided by well-formed sentences. It is supposed to form an alternative quasi-language, one based upon her own moment-to-moment trains of perception, association, and thought. Wittgenstein, however, spent much of his adult life questioning this idea of language as a veil covering our "immediate" mental life, against the deeply Cartesian idea that, in Stein's formulation, "Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind." For Wittgenstein, nonsense is not somehow "closer" to our "real" thought process. Indeed, given the difficulty we would have in placing the phrase "Roast potatoes for" within our inferentially related web of beliefs (what would <i>entail</i> that "Roast potatoes for"? what would <i>follow</i> from it?), it would probably not deserve to be called a "thought" at all. Wittgenstein would probably see Stein's words as a collection of private associations, the effects of various yet-to-be-determined (or simply unrecoverable) causes&#x02014;interesting perhaps to a clinical psychologist but certainly not anything like a language. All of which is to say that what interests Wittgenstein about nonsense is not the self-enclosed "games" we can play with it, but what it says about 

<b></b>

our ways of making sense elsewhere, about the shape of our linguistic life as a whole. His interest is less in "poetry games" per se than in the <i>Lebensform</i> made manifest through and within such phenomena.
</p>

<p>
And this leads us to my third and final point about critical discussions of things like "sound patterning." Recall the crucial assumption made above when I began to describe how, despite appearances, Stein's texts could be said to make sense. The crucial move that allowed us to start looking for the "sound patterning" of Stein's work was my assumption of rationality in the speaker, which in this case meant assuming that <i>Stein is not herself as childish as her work sometimes appears</i>.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  But how, we should ask, do we know this is true of Stein? After all, Gold is probably not the only one to have thought that her work resembles "the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums." To know that Gold was wrong, and to know that our own assumption of rationality is warranted, we can only do one thing: namely, appeal to Stein's biography and set her individual texts within the context of her intellectual development generally, a context that would include not only the author's individual psychology but also the culture in which she learned the linguistic norms against which her work so often reacted.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  To see Stein's texts against the background of Stein's biography hardly shows any original critical insight, of course. Indeed, however many journal articles have been written about Eliot's conversion or Woolf's sexuality or Pound's politics, critics probably find refuge in biography more habitually when discussing Stein than with any other prominent twentieth-century writer. The early studies with William James, the emigration to Paris, the glamorously bohemian friends, the relationship with Alice, the salon, the gregarious personality, the volunteer work in the war: these and other details are not merely the provenance of eager biographers, but are an indispensable component of all Steinian criticism. This is true even of Stein's most sensitive and devoted readers: Donald Sutherland, whose anecdotal explication of Stein's "continuous present" I noted above; Richard Bridgman, who says in the introduction to his classic study of Stein that the ground of her texts' allusions "lay in Gertrude Stein's head"; Wendy Steiner, who, much like Steven Meyer and others, describes Stein's portraits as a radicalization of James's psychology; William Gass, who admits when explicating the "etymological narrative" of <i>Tender Buttons</i> that knowledge of "Gertrude Stein's daily life and obsessive concerns is essential"; Richard Poirier, whose explication of Steinian puns is buttressed by extensive reference to her sexual life with Alice; Lisa Ruddick, who grafts the "drama" of Stein's "private emotional crises" onto the "drama of Stein's self-situation within twentieth-century thought"; and of course Perloff, whose descriptions of sound patterns in Stein is reinforced by quiet forays into biography whenever some detail (the identity of Ren&#x000E9; Crevel, Stein's dislike of Marinetti, etc.) seems relevant.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This is by no means meant as a criticism of these critics. My point, rather, is merely to draw attention to what underlies this persistent critical strategy, what makes reference to Stein's biography&#x02014;not only in the case of other discussions, but in my own as well&#x02014;virtually unavoidable. In the terms I have been laying out here, the continual reference to Stein's biography among her readers is symptomatic of the priority of the 

<b></b>

personal level of description, the level on which our publicly observable norms are first determined, where we first learn how to ascribe beliefs and desires and meanings, and where we turn when seeking reasons in the explanation of behavior. For it is there, in our ordinary habits of sense-making, in our experience as language-users within a particular environment, that we locate the background of rational, intentional action against which non-normative deviations can be discerned. Alternative modes of making sense, whether through "spatial form" or "sound patterning," presuppose the norms of rationality that we learn initially at the public level, in the process of making sense of speakers and agents. Stein's work, I am suggesting, gives us so little obvious content and departs so drastically from our ordinary ways of making sense that, as long as we are unwilling to dismiss her altogether as idiotic (and dismissing her, we should always remember, is an option for which many intelligent readers have opted), we almost necessarily need to look for some supplementary resources.
</p>

<p>
Which, from the point of view I have been sketching here, should come as no surprise. When we encounter difficulties of the sort posed by Stein, the sense-making that comes so effortlessly and swiftly in everyday life abandons us, and we necessarily seek other means of rationalizing what we observe. Often this means seeking out other things that the person has said or done, other statements that would justify the strange physical or verbal actions. And indeed, it is no coincidence that the great flowering of experimental literature in the first half of the twentieth century was accompanied by a great flowering of aesthetic manifestos, documents which sought to clarify the point of what seemed to many readers quite pointless. Making sense of a text through other things a person has said and done, however, is only the initial step towards locating it within a wider domain of normatively recognized activity. This is not to say that recourse to certain biographical and cultural details will absolutely determine the content of Stein's texts. There is always a degree of indeterminacy when we try to correlate content-poor processes or artifacts to our other, more conventional, finer-grained descriptions of behavior. But the continual effort demanded of us in dealing with Stein is ultimately her great interest, and the reason she is so central to any account of modern literature. Her words are so in need of interpretation that we are eventually forced, as I have been here, to make explicit at least some of our ordinary strategies for making sense. Stein's obscurities put our ordinary practices&#x02014;our descriptions of the world, of each other&#x02014;into sharper relief than they are normally allowed. This is not a "scientific" process; there is little that is law-like in the kinds of sense-making activities that Stein's texts demand. But that is not to their detriment. In their cryptic way, Stein's texts do all that any literary text can: they force us to make <i>ourselves</i> explicit, to make explicit that indefinite, ever-shifting <i>Lebensform</i> of which, at most times and with most texts, we remain only dimly aware.

My claim that one must advert to biography to make sense of Stein's utterances needs to be qualified. One could also rationalize them by treating them as if they were spoken or written by oracles, prophets, or some other entity who characteristically speaks in riddles and enigmas. To do so, however, would be to endanger other firmly entrenched beliefs. In particular, it would not cohere with our belief that Stein is a human being; we would be treating her as something more than, or at least other than, a person. That this step is rarely taken by critics says something important about the moral framework in which we read Stein and live our lives.
