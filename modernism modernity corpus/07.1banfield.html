But for all their vagueness, for all their lack of definition, these
controlling presences, these sources of power, these things with an
inner life, with their own richness of content, these beings, with the
destiny of the world hidden in their natures, are what we want to know
about. As we cross a road busy with traffic, we see the colours of their
occupants; but at the moment we are absorbed in using this immediate
show as a symbol for the forces determining the immediate future.

There are two competing aesthetics of temporality in modernism, one
"spatialized," its model of time marked by breaks and often attacked as
"static"; the other a celebration of movement and speed. Their points
of reference are competing conceptions of time. Recent commentators
on British modernism usually have seen both these philosophies as
continental. Leaving aside Martin Heidegger, whose <I>Sein und Zeit</I>
(1927 [Being and time]), while certainly one important expression of
the period's preoccupation with time, was not a direct influence on any
of the modernists writing in English, the two currents are generally
attached to Hegelianism and Bergsonism,

<B></B>

respectively. Critics have had little to say about any specifically
British philosophies of time and any controversies about time in England
in the first decades of this century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Yet an immersion in the intellectual life of the period leads to
 the discovery of a debate about time that counterposes two British
 philosophies of time, both equally hostile to Bergson. One is Hegelian
 and the other, while anti-Hegelian, could be said to incorporate
 important features of Hegelian idealism in the cause of a new realism. In
 particular, it relates a spatialized and seemingly still time to a theory
 of change. The locus of the debate was Cambridge; its protagonists were
 largely members of the Cambridge Apostles, the philosophical society
 that included Alfred North Whitehead, G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and,
 briefly, Ludwig Wittgenstein. The young Apostle John Maynard Keynes,
 who had attended J. M. McTaggart's lectures, delivered a paper on
 "Time" to the Society in 1903.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The Apostles included Roger Fry, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, and
 E. M. Forster, which suggests that this time-thinking may have had
 repercussions beyond the immediate circle of Cambridge philosophy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To the extent that one can claim the existence of a coherent Cambridge
philosophy of time, it developed as part of the project Moore called in
1903 "The Refutation of Idealism," for there were British Hegelians,
the most preeminent of which was Oxford's F. H. Bradley. The Apostle
J. M. McTaggart, "the idealist philosopher Cambridge took seriously,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 had, like Bradley, maintained that time is unreal, which Moore found
 "a perfectly monstrous proposition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 McTaggart had published "The Unreality of Time" in <I>Mind</I> in
 1908, but 1927 saw the publication of <I>Sein und Zeit</I> as well as
 the posthumous appearance of McTaggart's account of time in <I>The</I>
 <I>Nature of Existence</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 It coincided with a series of publications at least partly addressing the
 subject of time in the wake of Einstein's general theory of relativity:
 Whitehead's <I>The Principle of Relativity</I> , C. D. Broad's
 <I>Scientific Thought</I> , Jean Nicod's <I>La Geom&eacute;trie
 dans le monde sensible</I> , and Arthur Eddington's <I>Mathematical
 Theory of Relativity</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 1927 was also the publication date of Russell's <I>The Analysis of
 Matter</I>, partly delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1926. The
 debate generated interest beyond the philosophical world. Leonard Woolf
 asked Russell in 1926 to review Whitehead's <I>Science and the Modern
 World</I>  for <I>The Nation</I> <I>and</I> <I>Athenaeum</I>,
 as he had asked him to review Broad's <I>The Mind and Its Place in
 Nature</I>; both reviews discuss time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Wyndham Lewis's idiosyncratic <I>Time and Western Man</I>  on
 what Lewis calls "contemporary time-philosophy" likewise registers these
 wider repercussions, as does Forster's <I>Aspects of the Novel</I>, his
 1927 Clark lectures also given at Trinity. There Forster writes that
 "in the novel, the allegiance to time is imperative. . . . Whereas in
 daily life . . . the experience of certain mystics suggests, indeed,
 that it is not necessary."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The year 1927, then, also that of the publication of <I>To the
 Lighthouse</I>, represents the culmination of a period of intense
 interest in time. Virginia Woolf's novel was its major artistic
 expression.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Woolf's heroine in <I>Night and Day</I> , who secretly studies
mathematics and wishes to be an astronomer, decided "she would force
herself to think out the problem of the future, or some mathematical
problem,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Woolf explicitly singled out

<B></B>

and named one aspect of the problem of time, what C. D. Broad pronounces
"the hardest knot in the whole of philosophy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The problem of the future was already an ancient problem, that of the
 future contingent: "Aristotle's question whether it is now true that
 there either will be or will not be a sea t tomorrow," which is
 set forth in chapter nine of Aristotle's <I>De Interpretatione</I> and
 taken up in the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Diodorus, W. and M. Kneale write, "maintains that all true statements
 about the future are necessary" as "a consequence of what is admitted
 by Aristotle, namely the necessity of the past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Jaakko Hintikka summarizes its usual interpretation: it will either
 be true that a sea t will take place tomorrow or that it will
 not. If it does, then it is already true. How then can tomorrow's sea
 t be contingent? "Hence the unrestricted application of <I>tertium
 non datur</I> [the law of the excluded middle] to statements about
 future events seems to commit us to holding that all future events
 are predetermined."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At stake then is the question of determinism, one more generally raised
by the debate about physical time as is apparent in the English title of
Bergson's <I>Time and Free Will</I> , translated, significantly,
by an Oxford philosopher, F. L. Pogson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
"I have never read Bergson," Woolf wrote to Harmon H. Goldstone in 1932.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 This does not mean she was unfamiliar with Bergson's work, however. A
 letter of Lytton Strachey records her attendance "crouching" at a
 1913 Aristotelian Society meeting where Bertrand Russell's niece Karin
 Costelloe, to become her sister-in-law Karin Stephen, presented a paper
 on Bergson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But it was not Costelloe-Stephen's "praise of Bergson"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 that generated Strachey's excitement; it was, he wrote, Russell's
 "pungent criticisms," along with those of Moore, "the very opposite
 of brilliant--appallingly sensible, and so easy to understand that you
 wondered why on earth no one else had thought of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 If Woolf knew Bergson, it was through Cambridge thinking on time. The
 question of determinism and free will had its place in the philosophical
 tradition her father had surveyed in his <I>History of English Thought
 in the Eighteenth Century</I>, in David Hume's discussion of the liberty
 of the will in <I>A Treatise of Human Nature</I>, and in Thomas Hobbes's
 discussion of the problem of the future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As a result, the whole of <I>To the Lighthouse</I>, even its title, is
 organized around the problem of the future.

the Absolute, in the knowledge of eternity. He <I>will</I>--apart from
philosophical mathematics--be so temporal, so immediate. He won't let go,
he won't act in the eternal things, when it comes to men and life. He

Idealism held, along with Bergson, that physical time--the time recorded
by clocks--is timeless. McTaggart represented it as "the B series,"
where the positions are related by being earlier than some and later than
others (<I>NE</I>, 2:9). But here the two philosophies parted company. The
Bergsonian version of real time was duration, the flow of interpenetrating
moments. Idealism's version, if it did not insist on "interpenetration,"
did see the movement from past to present to future represented by the
tenses as essential to temporality. Only, McTaggart argued the unreality
"of tense and of the flow of time," as D. H. Mellor puts it, that the
relations of past, present, and future are self-contradictory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "McTaggart's proof," Mellor writes, "is very simple. Many
 <I>A</I> series positions are incompatible with each other. An
 event which is <I>yesterday</I>, for example, cannot also be <I>tomorrow</I>. . . . Everything occupies every <I>A</I> series position,
 from the remotest future, through the present, to the remotest past. But
 nothing can really have incompatible properties," so nothing can in
 reality be past, present or future (<I>RT</I>, 92-3, emphasis
 in original). E.g., a particular occasion of inclement weather may be
 represented by the propositions "it will rain tomorrow," "it is raining
 now," and "it rained yesterday," depending on when the statements
 occur. This entails that for an event to be "in time," it must possess
 "incompatible determinations," i.e., if it "is past, it has been present
 and future" (<I>NE</I>, 2:20). "It follows," McTaggart argues, "that
 there can be no change unless some propositions are sometimes true
 and sometimes false." He gives as an example "'it is now raining'"
 (<I>NE</I>, 2:15).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell defended a position "in the middle," "pierced" on both sides,
"like St. Sebastian," by time's arrow and its flight.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 He conceded that A-series "events are not eternally past or eternally
 present or eternally future, but change in these respects" (<I>CPBR</I>,
 9:261). He agreed that "[s]uch a statement as 'it is raining' is
 sometimes true and sometimes false" (<I>HWP</I>, 588). Moore had likewise
 observed that "whenever we use the present tense in its primary sense, it
 seems to me plain that . . . we do mean something different by it each
 time we use it. . . . [a]nd similarly with the past and future tenses,"
 and that "if I say 'It will rain tomorrow,' these words have a different
 meaning today from what they would have if I used them tomorrow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But Russell locates this A-series characteristic in something extraneous
 to time: "past, present and future arise from time-relations of subject
 and object, while earlier and later arise from time-relations of object
 and object."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Russell "reject[s] the A series," McTaggart says in summarizing him,
 because "past, present, and future do not belong to time <I>per se</I>,
 but only in relation to a knowing subject. . . . If there were no
 consciousness, there would be events which were earlier or later than
 others, but nothing would be in any sense past, present, or future"
 (<I>NE</I>, 2:13-4). The removal of the subjective element yields
 the B series: crucially for Russell the order of the two series is the
 same, which permits them to be "correlated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The notion is central to Russell's claimed solution: a particular
 present event is earlier than a future one and the logical relation
 of "earlier or later than" holding between the two events does not
 change when the present event becomes past. This is the permanence of
 the logical relations of the B series: "If M is earlier than N, it is
 always earlier" (<I>NE</I>, 2:10).

<B></B>

Russell does not agree with McTaggart, however, that "if we remove the
A series" from the B series, "we are left with a series which is not
temporal" (<I>NE</I>, 2:15). It is true that time is frozen thereby into
an unchanging series, but it nonetheless represents change: "this eternal
passing and flowing," as Woolf would write,"was struck into stability."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Russell's solution will require representing contingent statements about
 the future in the same way as it represents those about the past. All
 time statements are thus endowed with the logical "necessity of the
 past," including those about the future. Logical necessity, however,
 is not determinism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
McTaggart's problem for Russell is ultimately one of language, "a
mere confusion due to the unfortunate fact that verbs have tenses"
(<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). Assuming "past, present and future are relations,"
the problem is "to define the term to which they are to be related,
since this term must be continually changing" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:261). This
"relatum" Russell calls "an ambiguous proper name" whose referent is
something momentary, e.g. "this" or "now" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). These
are the terms linguistics calls "deictics" or "shifters." They shift
reference with each use. In "On the Experience of Time," Russell makes
"now" the key to the past-present-future series; "<I>present time</I>" is
"a class of all entities that are <I>now</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The shifting "now" contrasts with dates, which denote fixed
 times. Absolute dates, like those famous ones Woolf inserts into
 certain texts, "the twelfth stroke of midnight, Thursday, the eleventh
 of October, Nineteen Hundred and Twentyeight"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 or "the morning of the twenty-sixth of October 1928,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 are not given in experience. Only relative order is, because "we cannot
 point to a time itself, but only to some event occurring at that time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As Mellor remarks, "Dates form a series . . . which is not the A-series"
 (<I>RT</I>, 19). In translating experienced into physical time, each
 "now" is correlated with a date. "I write the date, because I think
 that I have discovered a possible form for these notes. That is, to
 make them include the present--at least enough of the present to serve
 as platform to stand upon," Woolf explains of the autobiographical
 impulse that connects the two.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Mellor calls the A series "tensed" by contrast with the "tenseless"
 view of time: "'tensed statements,'" according to Robin Le Poidevin
 and Murray MacBeath, "reflect a given temporal perspective" by "the
 grammatical tense of a verb or in the use of some such term as 'past,'
 'present,' 'future,' 'now,' 'then,' 'yesterday,' 'next year,' 'the
 month after next,' 'in a short while,' 'a long time ago,' etc."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Note that these terms are deictics. Tense in this view becomes the
 essence of temporal deictics. Russell's alternative sees tense as a
 special case of the deictic's built-in subjectivity.

<B></B>

Since we will argue there are linguistic tenses with no "temporal
perspective," in Le Poidevin and MacBeath's sense, we will distinguish
"deictic" from "nondeictic" tense. Making deixis and not tense the
defining category--where deixis includes both temporal and spatial
forms--and allowing nondeictic tense to represent B-series time relations
is a version of the spatial analogy with time. Bergson, who rejects the
abstract time of physics as "spatialized," holds the tensed view.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The uniqueness of Russell's position is to defend a spatialized notion
of time not as timeless but as the goal of a knowledge of time "by
description." Since it is achieved by "correlating" the "nows" that
are directly apprehended objects of "knowledge by acquaintance" with
fixed positions in the B series, Russell's solution, like Moore's, thus
requires a language in which the "shifting" deictic terms are replaced
in propositions about time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 This includes tensed propositions. "Mr. Russell holds that such
 propositions are ambiguous, and that to make them definite we must
 substitute propositions which are always true or always false," e.g.,
 "'the fall of rain is simultaneous with this judgment,'" McTaggart
 continues (<I>NE</I>, 2:165). Russell thinks it impossible "to arrive at
 a just philosophy of time except by employing verbs in a sense divorced
 from tense." Only then can one "say that past, present, and future are
 [in a sense without tense] all equally real; what is false is to say
 that the future 'is' when 'is' means 'is now'" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262;
 Russell's brackets).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "is now" Moore calls "the present tense in its primary sense." It
"express[es] the idea that a given event is contemporary with our actual
use of it," i.e., with the speech act (<I>PS</I>, 136). It is a deictic
present. Russell creates a "tenseless," i.e., nondeictic present by making
it cotemporal not with a present deictic but with a fixed time adverbial,
e.g., "'It will rain tomorrow' is one of the class of propositions
'It rains at time <I>t</I>,' where t is different times." (<I>LK</I>,
255) In "[t]he statement that a thing exists at time <I>t</I>," Russell
explains, "'exists' is used without tense" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). Arguing,
as he says, against William James's claim that "truths are mutable,"
Moore similarly distinguishes between "ideas" and "words" (<I>PS</I>,
134 ff.). Hence, as Mellor presents it, McTaggart's claim about the
unreality of time is really about tense: "nothing in reality has tenses"
(<I>RT</I>, 93). We only stipulate that tense means deixis. Russell's
solution requires a notion of change not dependent on deictic or shifting
tense, as put forth in his <I>Principles of Mathematics</I>, section
442. Peter Geach has called this notion "<I>Cambridge</I> changes":
"An object O is said to 'change' in this sense if and only if there are
two propositions about O, differing only in that one mentions an earlier
and the other a later time, and one is true, the other false."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Thus, if "it is raining on 1 May 1996" is true of the weather on that
 date but "it is raining on 2 May 1996" is not, the weather can be said to
 have changed. "That is to say," McTaggart comments, "there is change, on
 Mr. Russell's view, if the proposition 'at the time <I>T</I> my poker
 is hot' is true, and the proposition 'at the time <I>T</I>' my poker
 is hot' is false." (<I>NE</I>, 2:14)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell's use of the present "exists" or "is" "without tense" represents
events in time with the same verbal form as universal truths. Universal
statements such as "All men are mortal" use the "generic" or "eternal"
present, whose "is," as Russell says, cannot mean "is now." The difference
is grammatical as well: the generic present

<B></B>

cannot co-occur with "now," nor, in English, take the progressive aspect;
we cannot say "Two plus two is now (being) four" or "All men are being
mortal" as we can "All dissidents are being arrested" or "The men are
being silly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Moore calls it the "timeless sense of the word 'is'": "beside the things
 which have been, are now, and will be, there are many other things also
 belonging to the Universe, which are and yet are not <I>now</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Russell asserts that "it is raining" may be sometimes true and
sometimes false, he adds, "but 'two and two are four' is always true"
(<I>HWP</I>, 588). Here "always" means "for all times," i.e., in every
possible world. When, in Russell's solution, past, present, and future
statements with changing truth values are exchanged for permanent or
always true statements at time <I>t</I>, when, in other words, the
shifting "now" is exchanged for a fixed or rigidly designated instant
of clock time expressible by a numerical hour or date, which is the
same operation that exchanges names for particulars by descriptions,
their nondeictic present becomes indistinguishable from that of universal
statements. Yet the permanence or tenselessness of universals is different
from the atemporality of nondeictic time statements, as is demonstrable
grammatically. For the generic present, incompatible with shifters like
"now," is also incompatible with adverbials like "at time <I>t</I>";
"two and two is four at time <I>t</I>" is equally impossible. Universals
cannot be said to be at "any particular time," whether shifting or fixed
(<I>PP</I>, 98). Universals have being, but things in time exist: the word
"exist" is taken to mean "'being at some part of the time-series.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Herein lies the difference between the atemporal permanence of universals
 and the permanent, nondeictic, temporal relations of empirical facts. The
 latter are always true in some actual world. Moreover, being fixed
 to a time, each fact about an event enters into relation with other
 such facts, namely the relation of earlier and later that erects them
 into an ordered series, whereas generic statements are unordered with
 respect to one another. This is what it means to say they hold at no
 particular time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell later adopts an alternative to the nondeictic (Mellor's
"tenseless") present: "the language of physics," he says, translates "A
meteor is visible now" into "A meteor was visible at 8h. 43m. G.M.T.,"
substituting a past tense for the now-less present. The "was" Russell
characterizes as "intended to be without tense," in this, the time-bound
counterpart to the generic present.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
Unlike the latter, it refers to a fact, unchanging in that it is
independent of any subject's (or any shifting term's) relation to it
yet somewhere in the time-series. "'There was an eclipse of the sun on
April 17, 1912' expresses now exactly the same objective fact as was
expressed before that date by 'There will be an eclipse of the sun on
April 17, 1912.' The difference between these two sentences lies solely
in the time-relation asserted to hold between the subject and the event
concerned" (<I>TK</I>, 106).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The confusion arises because the "European languages," Russell says, "are
absolutely destitute of means of speaking of an event without indicating
its temporal relation to the speaker," i.e., to a "now," and therefore
"there is no way of expressing the eternity of the fact as opposed to
the transiency of the event" (<I>TK</I>, 107).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 This "gross incapacity of the languages spoken by western philosophers"
 is not universally

<B></B>

the case, however (<I>TK</I>, 107). There exists a "historical" or
"narrative" past, like Russell's past "without tense"--our nondeictic
past--e.g. the French aorist, preterite, or <I>pass&eacute; simple</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Its uses are written, "literary";
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 it is the tense used in the French novel, that "narrative past" that
 for Roland Barthes links "writing and the novel."

 It expresses the permanence of the relation of earlier or later without
 reference to the speaker's time. "Now one thought of it," Mrs. Ramsay
 reflects on "this night," "cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed
 always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck
 everything into stability" (<I>TL</I>, 170). Perhaps this is why
 McTaggart says of Russell's position that "if there were events earlier
 than any consciousness, those events would never be future or present,
 though they could be past" (<I>NE</I>, 2:13-14). Russell in effect
 makes all propositions about events in time statements about the past.

The peculiar "necessity of the past," as Russell presents it, is
expressed by the permanence of nondeictic time-statements about individual
events. Their "necessity" is not that of classic, necessary propositions
in the generic present, which is what Moore has in mind when he states
that propositions where "the distinction between 'This is' and 'This
was' is disregarded" must "involve necessity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The latter hold for all worlds, all times. The nondeictic past, however,
 means that "such-and-such an

<B></B>

event happened at such-and-such a time" is always true and not that
"such-and-such an event happens" is always true; such statements
represent possibilities actualized in some world, i.e., at some
time. The distinction is like Hintikka's between "omnitemporality" and
"eternity" (<I>TN</I>, 83-4). Aristotle's problem, he thinks, is
that of "<I>omnitemporal</I> truth": "that statements about individual
future events have <I>always</I> been true if they are true at all,
and <I>always</I> false if false at all" and that they are "true or
false <I>necessarily</I>" but not true necessarily or false necessarily

Russell rejects McTaggart's "contention that time is unreal" "as based
upon fallacious reasoning" (<I>OK</I>, 171). His nondeictic series
avoids the contradictions of the deictic A series. But, McTaggart
argues, it commits Russell to a timeless vision in which the future
is determined. If Russell "is right, all judgments are either always
true, or always false. Then, I maintain, no facts change" (<I>NE</I>,
2:16). Russell admits that "there is some sense . . . in which time
is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of reality. Past and
future must be acknowledged to be as real as the present, and a certain
emancipation from slavery to time is essential to philosophic thought"
(<I>OK</I>, 171).

 It is "better to allow the effect to be before the cause or simultaneous

 future 'determines' the past in exactly the same sense in which the past
 'determines' the future" if "[t]he word 'determine,' here, has a purely
 logical significance," i.e., the "logical necessity" of Wittgenstein's

Science substitutes for "the trivial principle 'same cause, same effect,'"
Newton's "uniformity of nature," i.e., "the principle of the permanence
of laws" (<I>ML</I>, 190). The laws concerned involve the nomological
relations of the "world of universals" or of "being": "it is not in
any sameness of causes and effects that the constancy of scientific law
consists, but in the sameness of relations" (<I>ML</I>, 188)--"always the
<I>relation</I> of cause and effect, not the cause itself" (<I>OK</I>,
235, emphasis in original). One interpretation of the "uniformity of
nature" is "the irrelevance of time," the principle that "no law involves
the time as argument" (<I>ML</I>, 198). Permanence here means eternity not
omnitemporality, the eternal present and not the nondeictic past. To what

<B></B>

degree does the principle hold for the future; can one "infer the future
from the past"? (<I>ML</I>, 192) Russell admits it is possible "that
all inferences as to the future are in fact invalid" (<I>OK</I>, 225),
perhaps as a concession to <I>Tractatus</I> 5.136: "There is no causal
nexus which justifies such an inference"; and 5.13161: "The events of the
future <I>cannot</I> be inferred from those of the present." "I do not
see how such a view could be disproved," Russell concedes (<I>OK</I>,
225). But to the degree that "inferences as to the future <I>are</I>
valid, what principle must be involved in making them?" Russell asks
(<I>OK</I>, 225, emphasis in original). His answer borrows from Keynes's
work on probability, for the predictability of future events concerned
the economist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Assuming the uniformity of nature, the future is inferred from the past
 not by the law of causality but by "the principle of induction": "an
 empirical generalisation from a number of laws which are themselves
 empirical generalisations" (<I>ML</I>, 189), it nevertheless goes
 beyond the empirical, since "the observed cases of the truth of causal
 laws afford no presumption as to the unobserved cases" (<I>OK</I>,
 225-6). "Prediction" is one name for this knowledge of the
 future. But science also makes predictions about the past for which
 memory is lacking, that covered by Mrs. Swithin's Outline of History
 in <I>Between the Acts</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 So not just <I>future</I> knowledge is at stake. The principle of
 induction permits us to "infer that any characteristic of the whole
 of the observed past is likely to apply to the future and to the
 unobserved past" (<I>OK</I>, 225). The "laws of probable sequence"
 are not necessary, however; "<I>any</I> . . . sufficiently frequent
 sequence will be causal," so, unlike Mill, "we shall not refuse to say
 that night is the cause of day" (<I>ML</I>, 187, emphasis in original).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of the present "existence" of the future for Russell seems
then only a special case of the existence of the unobserved. Real time
includes an unobserved but not necessarily unknown time, if knowledge
is not restricted to acquaintance or direct apprehension but allows
knowledge by description. The compact series of "instants of time"
means we "either bring in events wholly outside our experience or
assume that experienced events have parts which we do not experience, or
postulate that we can experience an infinite number of events at once"
(<I>OK</I>, 126). Broad had tried to treat the future differently from
the past, claiming that "judgments which profess to be about the future"
in fact "do not refer to any fact, whether positive or negative, at the
time when they are made" (<I>ST</I>, 73). Hence, "the Law of Excluded
Middle does not apply to all judgments," namely not to those about the
future. "Dr. Broad's theory," McTaggart objects, "would involve that 'it
will rain to-morrow' is neither true nor false," whereas "[i]t seems to
me quite certain that 'it will rain to-morrow' is either true or false"
(<I>NE</I>, 2:24). Russell's objection is twofold: future and past only
differ in the A series by virtue of its deictic point of reference and
by virtue of the differing nature of knowledge of the past and of the
future. "Mr. Broad's contention that the time-series essentially has sense
from earlier to later, rather than vice-versa," Russell thinks, "amounts
merely to the empirical fact that memory only works one way. There is
no reason, except brute fact, why we should not remember the future as
well as the past" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The future is determined, Russell thus concedes, but only to the degree
the past is. "You cannot make the past other than it was--true, but this
is a mere application of the law of contradiction. . . . But also you
cannot make the future other than it will be; this again is an application
of the law of contradiction" (<I>ML</I>, 195). In any case, knowledge of
neither future nor past makes them what they are: "the supposed prevision
would not create the future any more than memory creates the past." The
problem is a "confusion of thought, due to the feeling that knowledge
<I>compels</I> the happening of what it knows when this is future," but
"knowledge has no such power in regard to the past" (<I>OK</I>, 239,
emphasis in original). But, Russell counters, the past could "have been
different if our present wishes had been different," concluding, "the
past cannot be different from what it was, but no more can our present
wishes be different from what they are; this again is merely the law of
contradiction" (<I>ML</I>, 196). This is the burden of <I>Tractatus</I>
5.1362: "The freedom of the will consists in the fact that future
actions cannot be known now. We could only know them if causality were an
<I>inner</I> necessity, like that of logical deduction.--The connexion
of knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity." Freedom
lies strangely in the limits of knowledge, in agnosticism. Or, in Henry
Le Roy Finch's reading, knowledge, insofar as its connection to the world
is governed by logic, is independent of any knowing subject, but willing
is not. One cannot "know" anything that is not something there is. So
what is known has to be what there is. But there is no logical necessity
that the world is what is willed: "The world is independent of my will"
(<I>Tractatus</I> 6.373). Hence, freedom does not bear on knowledge.

The vision involves, then, a certain determinism. Mrs. Ramsay, observing
"the long steady stroke" of the lighthouse clock, repeats the future
contingent "it will end, it will end . . . . It will come," to transform
it into a fatal "what will be will be" (<I>TL</I>, 97). The early Russell
rejected the distinction between the necessary and the contingent in
holding "that all propositions are necessary."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 "Everything is in a sense a mere fact," he claimed, and "there seems
 to be no true proposition of which it makes sense to say that it might
 have been false. . . . What is true, is true; what is false, is false;
 and concerning fundamentals, there is nothing more to be said."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 In the Russellian solution to the problem of the future, the Platonism
 of the early logic is projected onto the conception of time; the
 impressionist world of existence is struck into stability by the logical
 world of universals. "In the world everything is as it is and happens
 as it does happen," reads <I>Tractatus</I> 6.41. But alongside this
 is the truth that "all happening and being-so is accidental." "What
 makes it non-accidental cannot lie <I>in</I> the world" but must lie
 "outside the world" (<I>Tractatus</I> 6.41, emphasis in original). This
 is the distanced position outside time from which the future becomes
 one with the past and the order of causality is discernable.

 For Russell, that no subject in time can adopt that perspective until
 the future is past is a "mere accident" (<I>OK</I>, 238). The observer
 outside time grasps the relations of events by a kind of predictive
 retrospect. Even "earlier or later than" are emptied of directionality,
 like "to the left of" and "to the right of." Russell's realism adopts

The problem of the future structures all of <I>To the
Lighthouse</I>. Raised in the opening sentence by the incomplete
proposition "if it's fine tomorrow," the novel's title

<B></B>

forms an element of the proposition's completion (<I>TL</I>, 9). The
opening sentence and title are only two tips of the iceberg of a theory
of time and change submerged in the book whose source is Cambridge. It
takes the form of the question of "the wetness or fineness of to-morrow,"
which we now recognize as the typical example for the future contingent:
Broad's examples--"To-morrow will be wet" or "It will rain" (<I>ST</I>,
72-3, 77)--like Moore's and Russell's "It will rain tomorrow"
(<I>LK</I>, 255), and even McTaggart's present "it is now raining"
(<I>NE</I>, 2:15).
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The proposition occurs throughout the first part of the novel in
 various modalities: "'But,' said his father . . . 'it won't be fine'"
 (<I>TL</I>, 10). "'But it may be fine--I expect it will be fine,' said
 Mrs. Ramsay, making some twist of the reddish brown stocking she was
 knitting, impatiently. If she finished it tonight, if they did go to
 the Lighthouse after all . . ." (<I>TL</I>, 11); "it might be fine
 tomorrow. So it might" (<I>TL</I>, 50). "'Perhaps it will be fine
 tomorrow,' she said." (<I>TL</I>, 26) "If it were fine, they should go
 for a picnic. Everything seemed possible." (<I>TL</I>, 157) "'It's due
 west,' said the atheist Tansley. . . . That is to say, the wind blew from
 the worst possible direction for landing at the Lighthouse." (<I>TL</I>,
 12) In part three, "'[i]t will rain,'" James "remembered his father
 saying. 'You won't be able to go to the Lighthouse'" (<I>TL</I>,
 276). The future is the realm of the possible: "It is possible that it
 may rain tomorrow" (<I>LK</I>, 255). Only time will tell, where "tell"
 means to narrate in the time-series. Mrs. Ramsay's position at the
 transparent window is then related to the uncertainty of the future in
 the form of the weather. At the end of "The Window" the theme reoccurs
 as Mrs. Ramsay again "looked out of the window" (<I>TL</I>, 185-6).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Between the Acts</I> likewise raises the truth or falsehood of a
weather forecast at the start: "'If it's fine,' Mrs. Swithin continued,
'they'll act on the terrace . . .' 'And if it's wet,' Bartholomew
continued, 'in the Barn.' 'And which will it be?' Mrs. Swithin
continued. 'Wet or fine?' Then, for the seventh time in succession, they
both looked out of the window" (<I>BA</I>, 22, ellipsis in original).

 It consists of the antecedent of a conditional whose consequent contains
 the novel's title: "'Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow, we shall
 go to the lighthouse'" (<I>TL</I>, 9). The "if" clause functions as
 the answer to a question posed just prior to the novel's first line, a
 question repeated later: "In a moment he would ask her, 'Are we going
 to the Lighthouse? And she would have to say, 'No: not tomorrow; your
 father says not'" (<I>TL</I>, 94-5).

In both <I>To the Lighthouse</I> and <I>Between the Acts</I>, the
deictic tensed statement "It will be fine tomorrow" and its negation
counterpose two mutually exclusive interpretations of the world. Lily
"with the Ramsays" is "made to feel violently two opposite things at the
same time; that's what you feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the
other, and then they fought together" in the mind (<I>TL</I>, 154). Both
cannot be true without violating the principle of noncontradiction. Woolf
underscores their incompatibility by making one male and the other
female. Mr. Ramsay negates the fact of light and sunshine; so also
Charles Tansley: "'No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs. Ramsay,'
he said" (<I>TL</I>, 129); Mrs. Ramsay, however, asserts it. When Minta
and Paul are "wondering about the weather" and Mrs. Ramsay observes that
"'There isn't a cloud anywhere for miles,'" "she could feel little Charles
Tansley . . . snigger" (<I>TL</I>, 86). Hence, the weather is the subject
of the quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay: "she flew in the face of
facts. . . . 'Damn you,' he said. But what had she said? Simply that
it might be fine tomorrow. So it might. Not with the barometer falling

rain. He said, It won't rain: and instantly a Heaven of security opened
before her" (<I>TL</I>, 50-1). Similarly, Mrs. Swithin hopes for
the best and her brother expects the worst: "Every summer, for seven
summers now, Isa heard the same words; about . . . the pageant and the
weather" (<I>BA</I>, 22). The series of counterposed statements take the
very form of the time series: "The same chime followed the same chime'"
(<I>BA</I>, 22).

It both rains and does not rain in the course of <I>To the
Lighthouse</I>. Hence, both judgments--"It is raining" and "It is
not raining"--become true and remain so; in McTaggart's formulation,
judgments "will become true or false when there is a fact for them to
refer to; and after this they will remain true or false, as the case
may be, for ever and ever" (<I>NE</I>, 2:23). It rains in the story of
the Fisherman and his Wife that Mrs. Ramsay is reading James: "outside
a great storm was raging and blowing" (<I>TL</I>, 93). It rains in the
night of "Time Passes" that follows part one's day and it is fine on its
morrow. Once the "downpouring of immense darkness" begins, "[n]othing,
it seemed, could survive the flood" (<I>TL</I>, 189, 191). The two forms
of conditional arguments "If P then Q; but not-P; therefore not-Q" and
"If P then Q; but P; therefore Q" are thus both demonstrated in <I>To
the Lighthouse</I>: in part two, it is not fine, therefore they don't go
to the lighthouse; in part three, it is fine, therefore they go to the
lighthouse. Rain is the prognostication confirmed by the end of part one:
"he was thinking, we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she
thought, he will remember that all his life" (<I>TL</I>, 95). "Would
they go to the Lighthouse tomorrow? No, not tomorrow, she said, but
soon, she promised him; the next fine day" (<I>TL</I>, 173). "'Yes, you
were right. It's going to be wet tomorrow. You won't be able to go'"
(<I>TL</I>, 186). The forecast that part two confirms is the contrary
of the one that part three confirms: "Then he reminded them that they
were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow"

<B></B>

(<I>TL</I>, 222). Statement and contradiction, thesis and antithesis,
are reflected in the very movement of the waves: "Yes, yes, yes,
the tide rushed out embracing. No, no, no, it contracted" (<I>BA</I>,
215). But there is no rejection of the laws of logic because there is no
"simultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions" (<I>ML</I>, 9);
it rains and does not rain, not simultaneously, but in time. "Every
year they said, would it be wet or fine; and every year it was--one
or the other" (<I>BA</I>, 22). "'And even if it isn't fine tomorrow,'
said Mrs. Ramsay . . . 'it will be another day'" (<I>TL</I>, 42). For
the weather is "variable" over time: "'The forecast,' said Mr. Oliver,
turning the pages till he found it, 'says: Variable winds; fair average
temperature; rain at times.'" Then "they all looked at the sky to see
whether the sky obeyed the meteorologist. Certainly the weather was
variable. It was green in the garden; grey the next. Here came the
sun. . . . Then in compassion it withdrew" (<I>BA</I>, 22-3).
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In time variability--the shifting property incorporated by the
 deictics--congeals into one particular sequence, the one James "will
 remember . . . all his life" (<I>TL</I>, 95). The question asked of the
 clouds, "Was it their own law, or no law, they obeyed?" is that of the
 nature of scientific prediction and causation (<I>BA</I>, 23).

The contradictions of the novels' sentences are not left to stand,
then. The voice Lily Briscoe hears "saying without prompting undeniable,
everlasting, contradictory things" (<I>TL</I>, 40), like "[t]he
relationship between your grandfather and mother" that Woolf describes
to her nephew Julian Bell, "the flute voices of two birds in tune
. . . only reached by rich, rapid scales of discord, and incongruity"
(<I>MB</I>, 37), with "the mold of that queer conglomeration of
incongruous things--the modern mind" (<I>CE</I>, 2:226) in which things
are "incongruously coupled"--"they blend but do not mix" (<I>CE</I>,
2:223), is the sound of clocks striking. The contradictory judgments are
resolved by their translation into fixed time statements. A plurality of
propositions becomes only part of the whole truth of history. Because in
it time passes, Woolf's art then cannot be read as embracing Bradley's
logic, which, according to Russell, concludes that "all truth is
self-contradictory."

The storm clouds of both novels also threaten war. There is perhaps an
allusion to Aristotle's sea t and an evocation of the sinking of
the <I>Lusitania</I> in "the silent apparition of an ashen-coloured ship
. . . come, gone," in the "purplish stain upon the bland surface of the
sea as if something had boiled and bled, invisibly, beneath" (<I>TL</I>,
201). For it is not the history of the weather that led Woolf to grapple
with the problem of time. It is not the dampening of a picnic excursion
that the caesura marked by "Time Passes" means to memorialize; it is
not a solely rainy morrow that divides the text into an earlier and a
later, a before and an after. The deaths it contains sever past from
future. But Woolf makes Mrs. Ramsay's and Prue Ramsay's private deaths
join, via Andrew's death "in battle," the war dead. For "[a]ll had been
part of the fields of death" (<I>TL</I>, 270). "Time Passes" divides
the prewar period from the postwar epoch. In her review of <I>Night and
Day</I>, Katherine Mansfield had accused its "real world" of being "shut
and sealed from us to-day," of being "unaware of what has been happening."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 The reason Mansfield gave Middleton Murry for the novel's remoteness
 was that for it "'[t]he war never has been; that is what its message
 is.'" Mansfield felt, by contrast, "'that nothing can ever be the
 same--that, as artists, we are traitors if we feel otherwise: we have
 to take it into account and find new expressions, new moulds for our
 thoughts and feelings.'"

That central event arguably made something like Russell's B-series concept
of time's passing the appropriate "mould" for the postwar generation's
"thoughts and feelings," its confrontation of both past and future. In
this light, perhaps the clearest vision of the future wrested from the
view of history as a series of irrevocable events is Keynes's <I>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</I>. Just as the <I>Tractatus</I>
was written within a world that had irrevocably passed, that of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, so Keynes's work saw "Europe before the War,"
"this economic Eldorado . . . this economic Utopia," as definitively dead.

The famous opening of the book is a kind of elegy for its passing: "the
law of diminishing returns was at last reasserting itself" against the
belief in an inevitable progress (<I>EC</I>, 25). "What an extraordinary
episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an
end in August, 1914!" (<I>EC</I>, 11) The past was evoked in order to
discern in it a future that could only start from the acceptance of
what had come to an end. "The clock cannot be set back" (<I>EC</I>,
37). The means of foreseeing how the future might be was first sought
in the future unforeseen by those within that paradise now lost, the one
already past in August, 1914, without "[t]he inhabitant of London" still
"sipping his morning tea in

 Mr. Ramsay's dogmatic predictions for the morrow's wet weather aim
 for this granite-hard quality that Leonard Woolf attributes to the
 "Stephenesque." There was, he explains, "something marmoreal or lapidary
 about their way of expressing those opinions, reminding one of the Ten

Commandments engraved upon the tables of stone, even when they were only
telling you that in their opinion it would rain tomorrow."

 But the commandment--the negation of "it will be fine
 tomorrow"--seemingly enforced by "the arid scimitar of his father"
 (<I>TL</I>, 60), turns out to be only the law of the uniformity of
 nature to which the father too is subject, as powerless to alter as
 the mother. So also the war, a man-made phenomenon, is subject to laws
 that escape the law-making fathers who initiated it. They set in motion
 events without a concern for the future, as if the past could always be
 revoked or undone. The language of Woolf's account of Keynes's reaction
 to the Paris Peace Conference is marked by this sense of the partial
 determinism of events set in motion in time:

Tragedy is the literary expression of this view of time. The key text
is the Apostle F. L. Lucas's <I>Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's</I> Poetics, published by Virginia and Leonard Woolf in 1928.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Tragedy, according to Lucas, yields physics' god-like omniscience of past
 and future, "If the gods alone, as the adage says, can be spectators
 in the world, the spectators in the world of the theatre should be for
 the nonce as gods,

<B></B>

knowing all or almost all," writes Lucas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Looking on the drama's future as Mrs. Ramsay looks back over the
 threshold, the spectators see it menacing the blind protagonists. "It
 is a mere accident that we have no memory of the future," Russell
 insists (<I>OK</I>, 238); it is simply "that natural human weakness
 which is unable to foresee the future," Lucas echoes (<I>TR</I>,
 97). "We might--as in the pretended visions of seers--see future
 events immediately in the way in which we see past events," Russell
 says. "They certainly will be what they will be, and are in this sense
 just as determined as the past" (<I>OK</I>, 238; also <I>ML</I>, 197).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "tragic" dimension arises in the difference, supplied by the
subjective element, between the A and B series, in what Whitehead calls
"[t]he contrast between the comparative emptiness of Presentational
Immediacy and the deep significance disclosed by Causal Efficacy," the
dissociation of moment and series, which he pronounces in Aristotelian
terms "at the root of the pathos which haunts the world": "'Pereunt et
imputantur' is the inscription on old sundials in 'religious' houses:
'The hours perish and are laid to account.' Here 'Pereunt' refers to the
world disclosed in immediate presentation, gay with a thousand tints,
passing, and intrinsically meaningless. 'Imputantur' refers to the world
disclosed in its causal efficacy . . . with its own individuality." The
one is the impressionist moment, "gay with a thousand tints"; the
other the B series, "where each event infects the ages to come, for
good or for evil." "Almost all pathos includes a reference to lapse
of time," Whitehead concludes (<I>S</I>, 47). This is the contrast
between the present and the inevitable sequence of moments constituting
the uniformity of nature, between the characters caught in the moment,
unable to see beyond it, and the fate that unfolds before our eyes. That
fate, in Whitehead's words, is a "primitive experience," one "heavy with
the contact of things gone by, which lay their grip on our immediate
selves," which gain "a sense for the fate from which they have emerged,
and for the fate towards which they go" (S, 43-4). For Whitehead,
"[t]ragedy becomes the order of nature in modern thought," the aesthetic
response to the confirmation by the crucial experiment of scientific
prediction--his example is an eclipse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In what way is the contrast also between the contingent and the
necessary? History is the realm of the contingent; what happens in it
could always have been otherwise and hence is not necessary. Yet, once
events occur, they cannot be reversed. Their historical character is
that of "an irreversible temporal sequence," Franco Moretti writes. It
"is dominated by the perception that there is no going back, which is
epitomized in the act of <I>dying</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 This irreversibility is precisely that necessity Aristotle assigns to
 the past. Once events happen, they cannot be otherwise. The element of
 chance or contingency is the mark of their empirical reality; their
 irreversibility gives them their necessary order. Tragedy is more
 philosophical than history by making apparent the necessary dimension
 in the actualization of a contingent possibility. Tragedy, Victor
 Goldschmidt writes, represents facts or deeds "that seem due to chance
 and that nevertheless . . . appear to be produced by necessity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 Its language is the past. "The past is indeed the most tragic of the
 tenses," Lucas writes

<B></B>

(we need only add that the tragic past is the nondeictic past). "If it
was happy, it is no more; if it was disastrous, it cannot be undone"
(<I>TR</I>, 80). "Yes, that was done then, accomplished; and as with
all things done, became solemn" (<I>TL</I>, 170).

The series of sequentially adopted shifting points of view from which
"[w]e can look backwards to past ages, or dimly divine the future"
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 provide the positions <I>To the Lighthouse</I>'s characters occupy
 on the eve of "Time Passes": "'Well, we must wait for the future to
 show,' said Mr. Bankes, coming in from the terrace. 'It's almost too
 dark to see,' said Andrew, coming up from the beach. 'One can hardly
 tell which is the sea and which is the land,' said Prue" (<I>TL</I>,
 189). From within the moment, nothing beyond is visible, for the
 "enjoyment of immediate sense-data notoriously inhibits apprehension
 of the relevance of the future" (<I>S</I>, 42). "Tragic heroes are
 always conspicuously blind," Moretti writes (<I>STW</I>, 58). They
 are blind to the pattern that permits the outline of the future to
 be discovered in the past. But once "the lamps were all extinguished"
 and the subjects scrutinizing the night have shut their eyes in bed,
 the future, never directly apprehensible, becomes known, but only to
 the "eyeless." For the novel also recounts future events that unfold
 unbeknownst to those sleeping through the night of time, some of whom
 remain in the dark about the morrow. It contains the "series spread
 out and simultaneously viewable," in Geach's description, "successive
 approximations to the truth" (<I>ML</I>, 108) whose implacable logic
 reveals, with hindsight, from the tragic perspective, the future's
 inevitability--such is its narrative omniscience, one belonging to no
 one in the novel but rather shown by the text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this way, the novel for Woolf gives the tragic perspective on time
seen from eternity, the one Augustus Carmichael, assuming the posture of
"an old pagan god" adopts at <I>To the Lighthouse</I>'s  conclusion
(<I>TL</I>, 309). In the tableau in which he and Lily Briscoe watch
Mr. Ramsay's tiny boat reach the lighthouse, poet and artist become
observers of a pageant, the "procession . . . past, present, future"
(<I>ND</I>, 447-8) translated into the B series, of a destiny whose
conclusion they can do nothing to alter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 In the novel, as in tragedy, "a terrible inevitability is gained by
 beginning, not at the very beginning, but just before the catastrophe,
 when the tragic mistakes have been made and are beyond God Himself to
 undo" (<I>TR</I>, 79). We recognize "the power to create the tense,
 overcharged atmosphere before the storm, to 'pile the dim outlines
 of the coming doom,' that forms no small part of the impressiveness
 of Aeschylus," according to Lucas (<I>TR</I>, 86). The backdrop of
 twilight, the fading of day, endows those caught in time with that
 "ethereal" quality that in "the failing light" the res on the lawn
 take (<I>TL</I>, 111). Within "this profound stillness" (<I>TL</I>,
 158), there is no time: "no tears, no sense that this sunny day is
 perhaps the last," as Woolf says of a Vanessa Bell painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 Part one of <I>To the Lighthouse</I> shows us the characters with no
 sense of the tragedy that "Time Passes" will contain, no certainty that
 it <I>will</I> rain, while from the retrospect of part three Mr. Ramsay
 sails to the lighthouse as to his destiny. (Even a dramatic unity of
 place is observed, as in <I>Between the Acts</I>; the novel's unity
 of time only revises the classical drama's rules requiring two days,
 with the space of a night between.) And, as Russell's statements about
 events are in the past, so the novel's statements are characteristically
 in the past. "'He has landed,' she

<B></B>

[Lily] said aloud. 'It is finished'" (<I>TL</I>, 309). This <I>consummatum
est</I> pronounced, like that at the end of "The Death of the Moth,"
Mr. Carmichael, "shading his eyes with his hand" (<I>TL</I>, 309), looks
out to the sea over which the guns of August are earlier heard--"there
came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of
hammers" (<I>TL</I>, 200). He becomes one with the res of the mothers
of the world, like Mrs. Pascoe "shading her eyes and looking out to sea"
(<I>JR</I>, 53) or the "elderly woman" <I>Mrs Dalloway</I>'s "solitary
traveller" encounters, "coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to
look for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing" and
appearing "to seek, over a desert, a lost son; to search for a rider
destroyed; to be the re of the mother whose sons have been killed
in the battles of the world" (<I>MD</I>, 87).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The encounter takes place in a "village street where the women stand
knitting and the men dig in the garden, the evening seems ominous; the
res still; as if some august fate, known to them, awaited without
fear, were about to sweep them into complete annihilation" (<I>MD</I>,
87). Here Woolf "imagines some village, in a remote part of the country,
near the sea" that she says furnishes the background of Greek tragedy
and that, aside from the climate, "[is] to be found in the wilder parts
of England" (<I>CE</I>, 1:1). The maternal re, whether Mrs. Ramsay
or the grey nurse who "resumed her knitting" over Peter Walsh's nap that
triggers the solitary traveler episode is a Greek Fate (<I>MD</I>, 85). "I
see her knitting on the hall step while we play cricket," Woolf writes
of her mother; "she seemed to watch, like some wise Fate, the birth,
growth, flower and death of innumerable lives all round her" (<I>MB</I>,
84, 34). The vision Augustus Carmichael, whose name connects him to the
"august fate," has and Lily Briscoe has had by the novel's end is that of
"the spectators in the world of the theatre . . . as gods, knowing all
or almost all"; it is that of Mrs. Ramsay "return[ing]" in memory to

of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which

Seen from eternity, the river of time crystallizes into a still series of
such momentary pools, yielding the tragic vision. It is articulated in
Augustus Carmichael's statement in the future perfect, "They will have
landed," indicative that neither Lily nor he can see the landing but
also that it is accomplished, achieving the perfection of the tragic
past--"he was surveying, tolerantly and compassionately, their final
destiny" (<I>TL</I>, 309). With the future perfect, the incompleteness of
the novel's title is completed, the event already takes its place with
the past in the theory of Cambridge changes: "The sights we see and the
sounds we hear have none of the quality of the past; nor have we any share
in the serenity of the person who, six months ago, stood precisely where

<B></B>

we stand now. It is only when we look at the past and take from it the
element of uncertainty that we can enjoy perfect peace" (<I>CE</I>,
4:164). Mr. Carmichael achieves such certainty, "surveying . . . their
final destiny" as the novel closes, with "the trident (it was only a
French novel)," with its series of preterites, "in his hand," by this
substitution of the god's symbol, desacralizing their history, for what
could be more secular than a French novel (<I>TL</I>, 309)?

desires, and they endeavor to derive precisely from that inexorability
of fate an altogether different kind of pleasure--the pleasure which
consists in the recognition of inevitable sequences."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 As <I>Tractatus</I> 6.374 comments on 6.373, "Even if everything
 we wished were to happen, this would only be, so to speak, a favour
 of fate, for there is no <I>logical</I> connexion between will and
 world." Fry's enduring novels accomplish what we recognize as "the task
 of tragedy," which Russell says, in "The Study of Mathematics," is "[t]o
 reconcile us, by the exhibition of its awful beauty, to the reign of
 Fate--which is merely the literary personification" of "alien forces"
 (<I>ML</I>, 65). They capture the property of the "great torrent" of
 life--"its complete indifference to the individuals, whom it swallowed
 up and rolled onwards" that fills Katharine Hilbery "with at least
 a temporary exaltation" (<I>ND</I>, 439). "So people stop short at
 natural laws as at something unassailable," Wittgenstein writes,
 "as did the ancients at God and Fate." "And they both are right and
 wrong," he goes on. "But the ancients were clearer, in so far as they
 recognized one clear conclusion, whereas in the modern system it should
 appear as though <I>everything</I> were explained" (<I>Tractatus</I>
 6.372). So Whitehead links the Greeks' "vision of fate, remorseless
 and indifferent," to "the vision possessed by science."

The stark stillness of a time with a relational, nondirectional, spatial
geometry imparts to Woolf's novels their "almost Greek severity of
form" (<I>TR</I>, 76). This "Greek" aesthetic underlies the Bloomsbury
modernism that was worked out first in the visual arts under the name of
"Post-Impressionism." It is not far-fetched to call the latter "Greek"
as a particular case of the "Mediterranean." Quentin Bell writes that
"C&eacute;zanne . . . signalled a new interest . . . in what [Duncan
Grant] would have called 'Southern' art," which, according to Bell, is
"tied to architecture." This connected it to geometry--C&eacute;zanne
"assumed the existence of and still needs a cubic and rectilinear
environment with vertical walls and horizontal floors."
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 Its geometry was inspired by what Russell called the "sharp outlines
 and definite separations such as the landscapes of Greece afford" that
 "[l]ike the philosophers of ancient Greece, I prefer."
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 Its was "the beauty of form," of "Mediterranean harmony"
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 like Mrs. Ramsay's beauty, "very clearly Greek, straight" (<I>TL</I>,
 47). Impressionism, by contrast, was a "Northern" art, born of the
 atmospheric "muddle" of that climate--English "light," Fry claimed,
 "was full of vapour. Nothing was clear."
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Northern art "grew up amidst coloured windows and darkened interiors,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 Bell says, although Woolf's contrast between the Greek "out-of-doors
 manner" and the "introspective melancholy of people accustomed to live
 more than half the year indoors" makes the <I>plein air</I>

<B></B>

school half a Southern one (<I>CE</I>, 1:2). Russell's mathematical world
of being is Greek; his "fleeting, vague" world of existence, Northern
(<I>PP</I>, 100). The point, for Russell as for Fry, was to combine
the two schools. So, to imagine Sophocles in the English village, Woolf
says that "we must annihilate the smoke and the damp and the thick wet
mists. We must sharpen the lines of the hills" (<I>CE</I>, 1:2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 We must substitute for English unpredictable weather the relentless sun
 of the South and become not just empirical but as "logical as the sun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 We could hear in Woolf an assent to Leslie Stephen's statement that
 "[t]he strong point of the English mind is its vigorous grasp of facts;
 its weakness is its comparative indifference to logical symmetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 Her espousal of Fry's aesthetic aspired to a grander architecture than
 that enclosed by the house of "The Window," one containing both window
 and lighthouse with the vast and vaulted spaces of "Time Passes" in
 between, an architecture based, like the Parthenon, on "a network of
 strokes" or "a mathematical diagram" (<I>JR</I>, 169). Yet, if the
 geometry of the novel forms, like the "strokes" of Lily's painting,
 a temporal, "rhythmical movement," it is nonetheless struck into the
 static conration of time as space Bergson finds so objectionable
 (<I>TL</I>, 236). The "whole series of uncomplimentary epithets" by
 which, according to Russell, Bergson "condemns"--as "static, Platonic,
 mathematical, logical, intellectual" (<I>HWP</I>, 810)--the position
 Russell defends could thus be summarized as "Greek," understood as
 non-Heraclitian. Bergson's is "the revolt of the modern man of action
 against the authority of Greece, and more particularly of Plato,"
 Russell writes (<I>HWP</I>, 792).
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 A formally static and nominally "timeless" universe--"the stable,
 the permanent" are Woolf's adjectives for the Greeks (<I>CE</I>,

 Forster's--Fry would find in C&eacute;zanne's Proven&ccedil;al geometry
 and Poussin's classicism.

A hasty assumption might pronounce acquiescence to time as fate a form
of quietism, the refusal of engagement and action. Yet Russell, for one,
never exempted himself from involvement in politics. The context in which
he speaks of reconciliation to the "reign" of fate puts forward a more
complex relation between acquiescence and action. "The contemplation of
what is non-human," Russell writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the discovery that our minds are capable of dealing with material not
created by them, above all, the realisation that beauty belongs to
the outer world as to the inner, are the chief means of overcoming the
terrible sense of impotence, of weakness, of exile amid hostile powers,
which is too apt to result from acknowledging the all-but omnipotence
of alien forces [<I>ML</I>, 65].

It is the "task of tragedy," Russell says, "[t]o reconcile us" to the
all-but-omnipotence of this "reign of Fate." Tragedy thus becomes the
literary expression of the study of mathematics, the intellectual pursuit
that permits Russell to find the point where the universal quantifier
ceases to apply to the power we confront. The question of freedom is
raised from the very perspective of necessity. For, Russell goes on,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
mathematics takes us still further from what is human, into the region
of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual world, but every
possible world, must conform;

<B></B>

 and even here it builds a habitation, or rather finds a habitation
 eternally standing, where our ideals are fully satisfied and our best
 hopes not thwarted. It is only when we thoroughly understand the entire
 independence of ourselves, which belongs to this world that reason
 finds, that we can adequately realise the profound importance of its
 beauty [<I>ML</I>, 65].

Mathematics yields not only the vision in which future becomes past. In
revealing the limits imposed by the world of universals, it also defines
the realm of possibility that allows the future to be affected by the
past. Russell, it is worth recalling, was in prison for "statements
likely to prejudice the recruiting and discipline of His Majesty's forces"
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 during the war when he wrote that "Pure logic, and pure mathematics
 . . . aims at being true, in Leibnizian phraseology, in all possible
 worlds, not only in this higgledy-piggledy job-lot of a world in which
 chance has imprisoned us" and invoked "a certain lordliness which the
 logician should preserve."
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Circumstances had forced upon him a position outside the struggle in
 which he had been engaged and from which he could see at once the course
 of events and the limited extent of his power to stop them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Freedom lies in this position's dualism, what Russell describes as
"the independence" of ourselves and the world of mathematics. "Not
only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in another
sense we and the whole universe of existing things are independent of
mathematics" (<I>ML</I>, 65). Dualism also means the incessant return
to "daily life" from this position outside time (<I>ML</I>, 18). This
is the character of Bloomsbury's modernity. Woolf had always given
a special, positive value to the term "modern"--unlike T. S. Eliot,
for instance. Our exposition shows that modernity for Woolf was the
"correlation" of the present moment--contemporaneity--and a vision of
history in which all time is ultimately past. The dualism inherent in it
defines a critical difference between Bergsonian futurism and Russell's
Greek time. For Bergson's dualism is the prelude to the rejection
of one side. Such is "the philosophy which has become associated
with . . . evolution . . . exemplified by Nietzsche, pragmatism, and
Bergson," Russell writes. He rejects it, thinking "time ought not to
enter into our theoretical philosophical thought," whereas the idea of
"<I>progress</I> . . . admits the difference between <I>earlier</I> and
<I>later</I> into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook." "[T]o
see the world truly" one must "overcome the difference of attitude towards
past and future." "Something of Hellenism . . . must be combined with
its [Bergsonism's] hurrying Western self-assertion" (<I>ML</I>, 21,
emphasis in original). The distance from one side to the other of the
dualism creates the position from which the actual moment we occupy can
be criticized. The "lordly" position Russell counseled could thus be
seen as the logical conclusion of the politics that had propelled him
to oppose the war; rather than plunge headlong into its prosecution,
as had Whitehead, who was influenced by Bergson and Gilbert Murray, his
opposition to it required a critical distance. The god-like perspective
from which all events appear as past is one that crucially permits this
distance from the realm of action, one that makes it possible to seize
what might be its consequences. "A reciprocal

<B></B>

liberty must thus be accorded: reason cannot dictate to the world of
facts, but the facts cannot restrict reason's privilege of dealing
with whatever objects its love of beauty may cause to seem worthy of
consideration" (<I>ML</I>, 66).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Cambridge theory of time takes its place in a larger history
of time-thinking. Russell's "idealist apprenticeship" connects this
thinking, perhaps surprisingly, with Hegelianism, while at the same time
separating itself quite explicitly from the latter. It was Hegelian in
that it conceived of history in terms of breaks; it was a revolutionary
theory of history, in that sense. Hegelian time-thinking's aesthetic also
accords a privileged status to tragedy. Its conception of tragedy has its
origins with the Greeks, but it has been altered to make it the expression
of modernity. The pre-Bergsonian Gy&ouml;rgy Luk&aacute;cs's 1910 essay
"The Metaphysics of Tragedy" shows the elements of the time theory
that shape Woolf's novels. "A drama is a play about man and his fate,"
Luk&aacute;cs begins his essay, "a play in which God is the spectator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 In the modern tragic world, "God must leave the stage, but must yet
 remain a spectator" ("MT," 154). The Greek ideas of "fate" and "destiny"
 are refashioned to permit another concept of human essence than the
 one that currently res in the term "essentialism," an essence that
 requires time, for a destiny can only "unfold" ("MT," 164). It is a
 revolutionary time, when, as Luk&aacute;cs says, "everything changes in
 a flash, everything suddenly becomes essential when the fateful word
 is spoken at last," "when enigmatic forces have distilled the essence
 from a man, have forced him to become essential," "his essential, true
 nature becoming more and more manifest" ("MT," 159, 155). It is "at the
 point" where "the miracle of accident has raised a man and his life,"
 Luk&aacute;cs writes, that "tragedy begins" ("MT," 155). What it raises
 him to is the realm of necessity. In thus passing from the "now" to the
 irrevocable series, tragedy "incorporate[s] accident into its world
 forever" ("MT," 155). The flash, the unforeseen change, hardens into
 what can never be otherwise. "This sense of necessity is not the result
 of the inescapable workings of causality," however ("MT," 157). It is
 omnitemporal necessity, governed by the law of the uniformity of nature:
 "Tragic drama has to express the becoming-timeless of time" ("MT," 158).

Lucien Goldmann's Luk&aacute;cs-inspired notion of "the tragic vision"
in his study of Jansenism and its perhaps surprising linkage of Pascal
and Racine to Hegel, Marx, Luk&aacute;cs--"all tragic and dialectical
authors"--demonstrates that "quietism," the withdrawal from the world
of action, can at certain moments in history be a revolutionary act.
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 The appearance of Goldmann's book in 1955 as one of the early signs of
 the "new criticism" in France can be linked not just to Barthes's book
 on Racine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Goldmann's "tragic vision" is not limited by him to the classical
 tragedy. So, when Barthes in <I>Writing Degree Zero</I>  says of
 the situation of the bourgeois writer post-June, 1848, "Thus is born a
 tragic predicament peculiar to Literature," the word "tragic" betrays
 a wider debate (<I>WDZ</I>, 60). Here it refers most particularly if
 not exclusively to the novel--earlier Barthes had predicated the word
 "tragic" on the novel's style, which he defines partly in terms of
 the preterite, i.e. the historical past tense, which he labels "one
 of the most obsessive signs of this tragic aspect of writing which was
 born in the last century" (<I>WDZ</I>, 38). It is a "fateful gesture"
 (<I>WDZ</I>, 40).

<B></B>

In the writing of history and of the novel, which share this tense,
"the preterite is the very act by which society affirms its possession of
its past and its possibility," part of a style adopted "in proportion as
existence becomes fate" (<I>WDZ</I>, 33, 36). Finally, Flaubert's sense
that "the bourgeois state is an incurable ill which sticks to the writer"
Barthes finds "the essence of tragic feeling" (<I>WDZ</I>, 64). In the
literary history he traces, "the purest" among writers "return" to the
"'Flaubertization' of writing" "as to an acknowledgement of their fate"
(<I>WDZ</I>, 66). As a response to Sartre's voluntarism, Barthes finds a
"necessity" in writing as well as a "freedom" (<I>WDZ</I>, 87). Writing
must acknowledge and acquiesce before what is the case, in the process
discovering what Luk&aacute;cs calls "the historical possibility of
tragic epochs" ("MT," 154).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The thesis implicit in these pronouncements is that the modernist novel
inaugurated by Flaubert is structured by the "tragic vision" in its
very language. Now this thesis has an alternative, the one set forth by
Franco Moretti in <I>Signs Taken for Wonders</I>. Moretti inherits the
very tradition Barthes does; they only differ on the novel's inclusion
in it, which could be a factor in Moretti's making <I>Ulysses</I> the
paradigmatic modern novel. Without denying it that role, one could observe
of it what Katherine Mansfield said of Woolf's <I>Night and Day</I>,
that for it "'The war never has been.'" Perhaps the explanation lies with
Joyce's Irish nationality and with his having spent the greater part of
the war in neutral Switzerland. What Moretti writes of Luk&aacute;cs--that
"between 1910 and 1920" "[f]orm coagulates into a cruel a priori--extreme,
tragic, opposed to life"--could also be said of <I>To the Lighthouse</I>
(<I>STW</I>, 11, 12). The opposition between life and form worked out
in Lily Briscoe's painting is a response then to a succession of events
a generation was powerless to prevent and even more powerless to reverse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If an important strain of British modernism saw the consequences of
the Great War with something like the vision of Greek tragedy, it was
not just to reconcile itself to these consequences. It was also to
understand the future via this terrible past. The strikingly similar
role of prognostications about the morrow's weather in both <I>To the
Lighthouse</I> and <I>Between the Acts</I>, one a postwar retrospective,
the other written on the eve of another war, yet both written in the
past tense, reveals the significance of the refusal to admit "the
difference between <I>earlier</I> and <I>later</I>." Yet the future
is placed differently in the two novels. The war divides past and
future in the first. The future the matchmaking Mrs. Ramsay attempts
to predict and affect does not turn out as planned: the marriage she
makes ends in divorce in the postwar world. She does not foresee her
own nor her children's deaths. But she in some sense divines even
those unforeseen events, achieving the calm acceptance of what "will
be" as if it had already achieved the perfection of the past expressed
by Augustus Carmichael's future perfect. But <I>Between the Acts</I>
ends with the characters in the position of those on the eve of "Time
Passes," confronting the war that was one of the "consequences of the
peace" Keynes had foreseen, gazing once more out the window at what
"was too dark to see" (<I>BS</I>, 214), going over the past to discern
the future, recording that day's "weather, which was perfect, save for
one shower" and recalling "'last year it rained.'" "'This year, last
year, next year, never . . .'" Ida repeats

<B></B>

(<I>BA</I>, 214, 217). The novel ends with a sequence of statements in
the historical past, e.g., "The paper crackled. The second hand jerked
on. M. Daladier had pegged down the franc. . . . The clock ticked"
(<I>BA</I>, 216-7). Meanwhile, "[t]he darkness increased" as
Mrs. Swithin reads her Outline of History: "'England,' she was reading,
'was then a swamp. Thick forests covered the land. . . .'" Once again,
the window gives on time passing. But "[t]he great square of the open
window showed only sky now. It was drained of light, stone cold. Shadows
fell" (<I>BA</I>, 218). The future in the fading light, just before the
curtain on the last act is raised, has become indistinguishable in its
darkness from the unobserved past: "It was night before roads were made,
or houses" (<I>BA</I>, 219). Nonetheless, against its uncertainty the
novel moves to seize the relentless pageant of English history precisely
in order not to give in to the feeling of impotence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here the contrast with the Futurist and Vorticist celebration of a blind
thrust forward could not be greater. There is much yet to be said about
the difference between the historical thinking we are qualifying as
tragic and Bergsonism, so often connected to modernism and also taken
over by various fascist ideologies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 But one thing is clear. Conceiving of time as a series of fixed events
 operating with a kind of fateful necessity, determining which future
 events are possible and which are impossible, is in no way incompatible
 with the attempt to change their course. Luk&aacute;cs's "gods of
 reality, of history," flattened to the force of events, "want not
 only to be the spectators of the fulfillment of revelation, but also
 to direct and accomplish that fulfillment. Their hands tug wilfully
 at the enigmatic yet obvious tangle of the threads of fate" ("MT,"
 154). For the sequence of events is marked by "something dangerous":
 "the great moment, the miracle," as Woolf puts it, the chance permitting
 its direction not to be reversed but to be altered. That cannot be
 accomplished by moving with the times in a celebration of progress--what
 is ultimately more acquiescent than that? It cannot be accomplished by
 erecting the meaningless, bare sequence into a story, a fiction--"we
 may again hope for the coming of tragedy," Luk&aacute;cs writes, only
 "once all the dancing shadows of a friendly order, which our cowardly
 dreams have cast upon nature to allow us a false sense of security,
 have entirely disappeared" ("MT," 154). It is precisely one of those
 accidents of history in which tragedy erupts--the "intrusion into a
 scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the
 most comfortable conclusions" of the "ashen-coloured ship"--that in
 "Time Passes" made it impossible "to continue . . . to marvel how beauty
 outside mirrored beauty within" (<I>TL</I>, 201). Instead, "the mirror
 was broken"; the illusion was shattered. In the interval, Mr. Carmichael
 brought out his volume of war poetry.

There has been a considerable literature on this debate since World

clear the problem was being debated; see Bergson, <I>M&eacute;langes</I>

In <I>The Problems of Philosophy</I> (1912; London: Oxford University

"correspondence" of "the <I>relations</I> of physical objects" with

both for "the transition from perception to physics" (<I>The Analysis
of Matter</I> [1927; New York: Dover, 1954], 333). See also Bertrand

"I believe Hebrew and Chinese are preferable in this respect, but
