<p>Only weeks apart in 1886, two events occurred in rival American centers of international trade. On April 10, "The Special Exhibition of Works in Oil and Pastel by the Impressionists of Paris" opened at the American Art Association on Madison Square in New York City. Less than a month later on May 4, a bomb, and retaliatory police bullets, exploded at an anarchist protest meeting near Haymarket Square in Chicago, the city's only market for local producers and small merchantry including greengrocers and truckfarmers. Beginning in the bloody suppression of the McCormick Reaper Works strike and ending in the sensational trial of eight anarchists, the execution of four, and the suicide of a fifth, the Haymarket incident and its mass print images specularized class conflict. America's first impressionist exhibition and its first red scare were lived at once, as simultaneous spectacles blurring the political economy of foreign art and the capitalist crisis dividing the nation while 600,000 workers agitated for the eight-hour day.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Two sources of economic anxiety, foreign-born labor and imported modernism, blended in public responses to the exhibition that associated the subversive politics of European anarchy and French impressionism; the consumer cultures of Madison Square and Haymarket Square; the exchange value of foreign art and domestic commodities. The "good bourgeois of New York," stated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Art Age</span>, were "flocking to look at the impressionists and to read their own condemnation" in images the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collector</span> regarded as "phantasms of dynamitic dexterity." Shapeless fears of post-Civil War America's "dynamite fiends," its "red-mouthed devils," took form in "explosions of paint," "rioting in color," and liquid fragments like "blood and ghastly wounds." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "Alien dealers" had introduced into the domestic economy "something monstrous," perhaps from the "planet Venus or Mars." Invasion—from the Old World and other worlds—became a mass culture metaphor for international capitalist competition.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>From the start, impressionist painting destabilized the commodity-form, passing duty-free through U.S. Customs, and shifting between taxed (sold) and exempted (exhibited) forms. It acquired or lost its commodity character from its sites of public display, in this case the sales galleries of the American Art Association in April 1886, and the loftier halls of the National Academy of Design the following month. The Association proprietor James F. Sutton, formerly of Macy's Fourteenth Street Bazaar, and the French dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, relocated their venture at a safe distance from dealers angered that Sutton, keeping one foot in and the other outside commerce, escaped the notorious thirty-percent duty on imported art. At the height of 1889 congressional tariff debates, the trade divided over statutes allowing associations to import on commission, but requiring dealers to pay at entry. The final split came when William Schaus and other New York dealers filed fraud charges with the U.S. Treasury Department against their major competitors for the French market including the American Art Association and the Grevin American Company. Organized under an association charter, Sutton's exhibition was a tax dodge for a "speculative venture," claimed his adversaries. Soon to follow was the ruin of legitimate dealers forced to pay import duties "even before seeing the goods."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Cultural critics saw it this way. French dealers anxious for new profit streams in America created a desire for impressionism to offset depleted stores of authentic Barbizon paintings. The rhetoric of artificial value intensified among those who agreed that while the impressionist market originated in Barbizon "counterfeits," American finance capital and its class structure promoted "wholesale forgery" [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Reformists considered the point in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Forum</span>, a new monthly positioning the fine arts in 1886 alongside labor unionism, socialism, and free trade. The columnist rhymed his critique of the gallery system with an indictment of new wealth from nothing—wartime profiteers whose massive paper fortunes accrued from runaway currency expansion and speculative exploits connecting railroads to Wall Street. America was rich soil for French dealers because the "unfettered powers of issuing bonds and mortgages possessed by railroad presidents and trustees and the guardian angels of corporations" had produced an "abnormally" large ruling class. Gambling on "prospective value as an investment" and the "irrefutable logic of public auction sales," millionaires speculated in Barbizon paintings "constantly rising, rising, like shares in a successful silver-mine." When word spread that the "stock had been watered beyond measure," buyers took the news in stride, counting forgery among the risks of "commercial life" until tumbling prices confirmed that "Rousseau and Diaz stock was not as secure an investment as had been believed."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Meanwhile, having "made a corner" in impressionist paintings abroad, Durand-Ruel planned to "boom them and to open a market in America," wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Herald</span>. Many believed him no worse than American dealers, who continued "booming" any Barbizon "daub, potboiler or scrap" until their French competitors proved impressionist art "saleable." The "boom on this side of the ocean" determined  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Monet's production system, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Evening Transcript</span>. Therefore, he "takes several canvases out at once, paints awhile on one, then works on the second, and so on, repeating the same subject," a practice that would continue "as long as Monet spells money." Like American greenbacks, Monet's landscapes acquired value from serial repetition, but slipped between capital goods and fiat paper currency to represent both commodity and its exchange system. Particularly after Monet's commercial success in 1892, market watchers interpreted the shift from realism to impressionism to mean "fictitious values," similar to credit, now displaced "staple goods."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The impressionist series, however, represented both future production and overproduction. Popular audiences related seriality to Barbizon forgery, each resembling industrial piecework, or the fabrications of a "vast studio in which half a dozen partners …  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> manufacture bogus pictures."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> The impressionist commodity-form combined fraud and the factory system, causing some to suspect that Renoir might be an entire "syndicate of artists" turning out canvases for "American millionaires of Oshkosh"; his nudes perhaps were assembled by three artists, one painting the heads, another the bodies, and a third the landscape settings. But Monet, calibrated to market dynamics, was a "machine" that produced and destroyed without distinction. Landscape fragments cut from "consecutive yards of the same blinding pattern of chintz" bore at once the stamp of machinery and the "grimace of a prostitute," wrote Alfred Trumble, the influential editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collector</span>. Here was the end expression of techno-sexual violence that "tears all grace" from a harvest field. Monet "rips [land] into iron lines and jigs it into saw edges," he "carves it," "mangles it," and "batters it," flattening gender difference into "Nature of cast iron." Despoiled earth and female filth combined in Trumble's fantasy that an impressionist bather (unidentified) turned the waters "green of her own periodical putrescence"; his fears of sexual deviance and sexless machines red in his imaginings that "no man" could perceive nature as the impressionists did and "avoid prompt suicide." At the same time, Trumble's vision reflected everyday relations, natural and social worlds turned upside down, women and capital colliding. The "putrescence" he sublimated into the impressionist female body surfaced in Chicago's mobs of unsexed women strikers, "guerillas in petticoats," or "amazons … affected with a malignant form of the eight-hour malady."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Trumble wrote all this in 1891, the year of Monet's first one-person exhibition in America, when social pathology mirrored larger hygienic delusions and dread at foreign contagion. An international cholera epidemic spreading from Asia reached the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> by way of a report from the Red Sea shores. "There is nowhere any attempt at sanitation," wrote the correspondent, "the ground is foul, the air fetid by reason of the rotting offal." Trumble drew foreign commodities into the contemporary discourse of disease, cautioning against Monet's river scenes, "slimy pools, fouler than the accursed waters of the Dead Sea … Would any reasonable being … drink from those fetid rills?" The epidemic flared in 1892, and with it economic tensions, so much so that U.S. President Benjamin Harrison ordered a twenty-day quarantine on all vessels and foreign goods arriving from infected ports. The presidential action translated into sensational headlines announcing "Cholera at the Gate," and sent profits reeling on Wall Street and the Chicago Board of Trade. Reporters simultaneously tallied cholera victims in Paris, trade losses in Chicago, and Monet's profits in Boston, the site of his second one-person American exhibition, which included a glimpse of his seriality, two images of <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>. Depressed by a weak foreign market, the value of real wheat and other grains plummeted and nervous Chicago speculators liquidated their positions.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>French impressionism situated itself in an increasingly speculative American art economy that displaced the consumer object with the interest it accrued or "capital invested therein." In 1885, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> introduced a secondary market of disinterested American buyers who considered art an "investment for future realization … staple goods, to be bought and sold over and over again, like calico, wool, or silk … safer and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> better than to invest in land or a house." To circulate rather than own, there existed "scarcely any investment safer and more disposable than objects of the fine arts."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Three years later, the elite critic William Howe Downes announced a turn in the selfconsuming market from "bread-and-butter art to caviar," from solid Salon fare to the impressionists' "curious and piquant flavors." New exotic tastes meant that dealers now determined trends in a marketplace distancing investors from products. Corporate capitalists hired a "picture-seller to choose their paintings for them, as they permit the upholsterer to select their curtains and draperies." Further, "picture-merchants say that they have customers who buy entire new collections to replace old ones at stated intervals."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> For others, a well-known provenance raised status value but put a ceiling on the potential resale of paintings considered a "dearer kind of wallpaper." Price must stay beyond the reach of "people who finger your curtains and make remarks about your furniture, indicating complete knowledge of where they were bought and how much they cost." This "secretive" collector understood that repeated appearances in the marketplace made art illiquid. Retreads, so called now, had no appeal then to the collector who "hates to have anyone recognize a painting on his walls because he values it simply and solely on the basis of cash." Broad audiences too adopted the speculator's language, wariness at dealers' "bogus bids," the "booming of foreign pictures into fictitious values," and early forms of flipping, retreads, and secret global reserve contracts, all clouding the issue of value. But the cyclical pattern of two late-capitalist eras remains clear: "Short-term investors in art are like day traders in the stock market," recently stated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span>. Linking the two economies was a new index of New York City art auction prices, the Mei-Moses Index, modeled after the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Monet's early collectors too manipulated the market with storied indifference, "buying for a 'rise,' or with a view to a 'sale,'" wrote critics of his day. Impressionism was the art of America's new business money, the <a href="http://dot.com" target="_blank">dot.com</a> stock of the 1890s attracting investors before turning a profit.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Between the Civil and Spanish-Cuban-American Wars, the popular equation shifted from painting = money to bidding = price fetish. The drive to fetishize price coincided with impressionist seriality that blurred capital and commodity, but visualized transitions from accumulation to speculation, merchant to finance capital, and goods to "intangible assets."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> The future value of Chicago city blocks, prairie grids, and French landscapes flowed beyond consumption into this modern economy named by Thorstein Veblen. By "intangible assets," he meant the current value of anticipated gains from systems that produced nothing, but made money, including credit and advertising. Veblen recognized physical and intangible capital as mutable, often interdependent categories, and reasoned, "This creation of tangible wealth out of intangible assets is seen perhaps at its neatest in the enhancement of land values." Land futures were central to Veblen's meditations on capital, notably where he rethinks assets from "physical things" to a "pecuniary concept," and distinguishes capital from capital goods. The extension of assets beyond the material was the first stage in comprehending the reciprocal conversion of tangible into intangible forms. Nowhere was the dynamic more apparent than capitalized property, combining land ("physical magnitude") and real estate ("pecuniary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> magnitude"). While each was a tangible asset, the economic forces determining its future value were not.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Reading publics understood that related market mechanisms—good will (the prestigious name of a collector or the powerful name of a corporation), real estate agents, rent, trusts and tariffs, art dealers, auctions, publicity, and supply—converted land and art into pure forms of liquidity streaming through an unstable economy. So did the "collector for revenue only." Coined by a New Yorker, the term derived from "tariff for revenue only," the 1880 Democratic Party plank supporting lower tariffs and the expansion of foreign trade. A <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> columnist linked free trade profits to Chicago's soaring real estate values by comparing art and land speculators, each seeking a "profitable investment for their surplus funds." Because the collector for revenue only had the capital to "beat down the artist's price" he could acquire "property which will increase in value at a more fabulous rate than Chicago real estate … Buying pictures which are sure to rise in value, such a collector … is accumulating a fund which he may draw upon at will when reverses in other speculations require it." In New York, a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> writer observed, "Good pictures are as good an investment as Brooklyn real estate, and if it is ever necessary to sell them, they bring as round an interest and profit."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Veblen's theory points to Fredric Jameson's concerning finance capitalism today, land speculation, and its culture of cinematic fragments and intangible money. Land speculation, he proposes, is at the origins of dematerializations of currencies and territories in cyberspace substituting global cities for solid ground. This "becoming abstract of land and the earth" means the "transformation of the very background or context of commodity exchange into a commodity in its own right," which in turn provokes new autonomous art forms.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> From here, we may begin to think impressionism through post-Civil War and postmodern luxury economies, and contests over the representation of value, without losing the epochal resonance of the 1890s. Monet abstracted Giverny into landscapes at a moment when late nineteenth-century investors transformed land into "liquid money," as Zola put it. Throughout his novels <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Argent, La Curée</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, wheat and gold flow together in speculative waves representing fortunes in constant flux. Zola blurs the economies of field and finance, begging and betting, in the venal Saccard, a high-risk speculator who "disdained to glean and pick up the gold which men … dropped behind them." His wealth was boundless, a "flood of gold … a sea of twenty-franc pieces … swelling from a lake to an ocean." The image of Saccard swimming through vast fortunes accrued in schemes reaching to the Middle East is set against peasants adrift in a world market, and about to drown in a "river, a torrent, a flood" of American wheat. The surplus of foreign wheat, predicted the schoolmaster in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, would turn French fields to "streams of blood, so that the land will once again be able to provide bread."</p>
<p>Water and wheat, blood and money, commingled in 1903 when Frank Norris likened Chicago's fevered speculation in a "Niagara of wheat" to money afloat: "All through the Body of Things, money, the vital fluid, seemed to be flowing more easily … it was … liquefying." The character of wheat in Norris's <span style="font-style:italic;">Octopus</span>, "neither solid nor fluid,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the character of his speculators who "never saw the wheat they traded in," provides our two directions.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> On one hand, I suggest that speculating reconciled the two-sided meaning of impressionism—as anarchy and commodity—amidst international tariff and currency debates upending the commodity-category, its valuation, and money. On the other, I use Monet patronage in Chicago, the hub of commodity futures and labor strikes, to equalize the impressionist commodity and its resistance to the market economy. My focus is the first American patron to recognize Monet's seriality, Berthe Honoré Palmer, and her nine canvases of <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. My point is to relate these to "liquid money" in and outside capitalism, and her serial collecting to the seriality inhabited by Chicago's women millionaires, speculators, and workers. What follows blends popular press accounts with Igor Kopytoff's "cultural biography of things," most importantly his analogizing the "way societies construct individuals and the way they construct things." Where these processes become transparent, we might consider what the private collecting of French grain imagery and open outcry trading in Chicago's wheat pit tell us about the complex cultures of capitalism.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The impressionist series absorbed competing stores of value financial conservatives declared real or fiat. Outside the gold and greenback economy, however, groups practiced oppositional "moneyless commerce," including forms of barter such as cooperative media coupons traded for goods or labor on Chicago's communist South Side. Like Zola's collectivist Sigismond, who declaimed, "Money must be killed," Chicago immigrant labor and farm communities similarly exchanged goods between "those who cannot afford money." Collective identity—"Aliens Barter Among Themselves"—formed through difference from "rude barbarians who insist upon being paid for their goods in gold."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Around the same time, the adopted Chicagoan L. Frank Baum enchanted children of the 1893 Depression with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span>  and Emerald City, where green skies and sunbeams cast land in luminous riches, but green pennies limited money to its irreducible form. Baum later wrote money out of Oz altogether and with it, the rich and the poor. Impressionist modernity too operated outside the marketplace because the "necessarily vitiating element of salability was unconsidered," wrote an admiring critic. Its "absence of concession to the market" was stronger by contrast to "shoppy" old master and Barbizon works. What emerged as anxiety and desire in the impressionist market exploded in a burst of post-Civil War strike violence. In 1886, a flashpoint of labor unrest, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> predicted the great industrial strikes of the 1890s, stating that the current art market "illustrates the dangerous increase of individual wealth as much as it does the advancement of general taste."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Highly publicized auctions and record prices set off rumblings of "actual criminality" among columnists who considered it a "reckless use of cash to put the value of a first class city house and lot" into art. The Depression of 1883–1886 and Eight-Hour Campaigns filled the streets with "monster" cross-class festivals while auctioneers staged counter-pageants of elite solidarity announced in headlines: "Railroad Magnates and Other Speculators Succeed in Capturing the Most Desired Costly Prizes." The roles performed in "theatrical auctions" were clear. Out of sight behind red velvet curtains, the "mysterious gloved hands" of disarticulated labor made paintings appear before an  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "opera audience in street dress." The real draw was the carnivalesque spectacle of the ruling elite taking on the character of unruly masses. These were highbrow versions of crowd scenes "where throngs of well-dressed people [wait] to see rich men struggle with each other for famous pictures."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Cane-brandishing millionaires "scrambled and fought for the pictures" in a riot of top hats, fans, opera glasses, and furs. In the thick of cutthroat competition, one glared at another as if "to choke off that exasperating five-hundred dollar bidder." Their decidedly "Anglo-Saxon quality, pugnaciousness … drove the pictures up, up, up," cheered on by a noisy and "immense audience greeting each famous picture with applause," until people and objects became phantasmagoric, the "vast public … itself a spectacle hardly less curious than half the contents of the collection."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Just as auctions made crowds and collections indistinguishable, and strikes did the same for labor and commodity, the collector became capital. In March 1886, a month before the first impressionist exhibition in America, luxury and labor economies organized into two powerful spectacles—the Morgan auction in New York City and the thirty-first anniversary celebration of the Paris Commune in Chicago. Newspapers in both cities announced the sale of the staggering collection formed by Mary J. Morgan after the death of her husband Charles, a "hard-faced, hard-fisted, hard-dealing" shipping magnate. Mary Morgan was the female grotesque, inert and bloated on lucre. A parody of her husband's wealth, her body was "encrusted with diamonds, with pockets so heavy with sudden-gotten gold that she could hardly stir." Her uncorseted distention spilled throughout her "mansion stuffed with greenbacks and with coupon-bearing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> bonds so numerous and multitudinous that she literally gave them away by the cabfull." She turned physical and paper wealth to waste, collecting by "throwing into the very gutter of extravagance the money her husband toiled so long, so hard to get."</p>
<p>Society rumors stopped short of "art mania," but repeated the irrational prices Morgan paid for art, jewels, and bric-a-brac as evidence of her "simple mind." Lacking the eye of a collector, she was a senseless "buyer." Obsessive collecting and its vulgar sister, shopping, were symptoms of consumer delirium perhaps brought on by widowhood, but more likely by a gendered "internal complication" that "disturbed her mind." Popular comment derived from late nineteenth-century medical discourse on female pathologies—kleptomania, collectomania, monomania—attributing these to reproductive disorders and the hysteric female imaginary. Diagnosed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Morgan was "disjointed … and whether it was mental, moral, or physical is hard to decide." What was clear was the economic threat posed by a woman who devoured and expelled her husband's capital, and by extension him: "Spend, spend, spend seemed to be the motive of her existence … as though she wanted to get rid of the money as fast as she got it."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> What if such women escaped their mansions and mobilized in public spaces of commerce, such as street, department store, trading pit, and auction? Selfmultiplying women—strikers, shoppers, speculators, collectors—easily could spread the contagion of bargaining, buying, betting, and bidding. The destructive potential of female crowds in the marketplace, ruled by their deviant passion for goods, raised fears of economic disorder and worse. Upheavals and reversals in gender relations were the apparitions conjured to demonize female labor; but, as we will see, these transcended class boundaries in Berthe Palmer's Chicago, where Haymarket Square, Marshall Field's, and the Chicago Board of Trade provided women multiple theatres for the performance of economic self-determination.</p>
<p>"If you wish to know why $18,000 can be spent for a little [snuff] bottle whose maker got about $5 for it … inquire of John Swinton and Henry George," wrote a reporter at the Morgan auction.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> His references to the leader of the Communist Workingman's Party in New York and to the founder of the populist Single Tax Movement named the class tensions directly beneath public fascination with the privileged. Even the prominent art critic Albert Wolff regarded auction bids, or purchasing power, as the marker of difference, stating that the convergence of "all the men who pay $20,000 for a picture" ranked among the world's "astonishing spectacles." During the 1889 Universal Exposition, when Andrew Carnegie and American finance capital invaded Paris to bid on Jean-François Millet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus</span> , and thus escalate an international tariff war, Wolff thought it a "pity that we cannot exhibit these millionaires for the benefit of the poor!" Alongside the exotic elite, "what would be the streets of Cairo, the Japanese village, or Buffalo Bill in comparison."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Fierce bidding made for striking pictures in the press, but paintings often disappeared in a welter of numbers: "The third lot of the 80 paintings sold for $487,925, or $70,550 in excess of the sum received for the 160 paintings sold on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. The average price paid last night was $6099.50 and the 240 pictures brought an aggregate of $885,300, or an average price of $3688.75." Prices in endless  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> lists streamed beyond money to represent the greater abstraction of future value, and generate an aesthetic system from what Veblen identified as a "blending and confusion of the elements of expensiveness and of beauty." Veblen's "pecuniary canon of taste" theorized the Gilded Age impulse to calculate to the penny and by the yard, "Picture Sales: Highest Per Square Inch." It also predicted Jean Baudrillard's "logic of sumptuary values." Baudrillard's witty analogy of an art auction to a poker game in which players bet on exchange values would have resonated with late nineteenth-century audiences who considered the art market an elegant form of gambling. But the more significant links between the two late-capitalist cultures are these: his theory that a bid instantly disconnects the exchange-value and use-value relation from its economic base, and that price has meaning only at the moment of sale. The split between value and price at the Morgan auction prompted some ridicule: "Such prices as $45,500 for the [Jules] Breton [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Communicants</span>]… are simply absurd, if used to base any idea of their true value on." Interest in art auctions, however, led the public to more thoughtful commentary on the slippery position between commodity and fetish. To many, "a painting is a thing of as definite a value as a ton of coal or a tub of butter," wrote a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> columnist. "I never saw a picture that I thought was worth over $10,000 and … whatever they have brought more than this has accrued to the benefit of speculators and dealers," he concluded. To others conscious of a political economy of art, there seemed no "financial equivalent for pleasure."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Complicating matters further was a foreign art tariff that superceded the normal pricing mechanisms of international capitalist exchange and established the government in a privatized market already trading on its own inflation. Exuberant bidding and Gilded Age politicking set into motion the upward price spiral Monet would exploit. Since 1790, the American government had collected a tax on foreign art, varying periodically between ten and thirty percent. But after 1883, when Republicans passed a thirty-percent duty to retaliate against a French ban on American pork, the "contest between the French picture and the American pig" organized public debate over the very nature of goods in an emerging global marketplace. The French pork embargo, supposedly a precaution against trichinosis, was one of numerous European barriers erected in the early-1880s against American incursions into agricultural trade with India and Russia. Impressionism simultaneously interrupted American culture, leading to bemused comment on the porous economies of farmers and painters, eating and looking: "The statesmanlike point of view in France is that the French stomach must be protected from the ravages of the morbid American hog and in this country that the American painter must be protected from the competition and the American looker-on from the unwholesome moral influence of French art."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The tariff would put an end to "hybrid" art produced by painters at once Americans while in Paris and Frenchmen while in New York, wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>. Both their identity and market were "unstable," the second subject to the impulses of "speculative dealers" and "passing tourists." Originality was doomed in a mass market for "pictures that sell for the moment to a class that does not pretend to buy to hold." But the home marketplace was no better. By 1888, the thirty-percent tariff on art imports contributed to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> a precipitous decline in the value of sure bets including Albert Bierstadt landscapes. French dominance and the tariff increase led critics to forego nationalism and posit the real value of American painting in its lower prices. The "great margin for profit" in French and other European paintings ruled the trade, but investments in American paintings yielded higher returns. The distinction between short (foreign) and long-term (domestic) markets was subtle but clear; "though the capital involved is naturally much smaller, the profits would in all probability be larger." Longstanding notions of cultural inferiority might put off a "certain number of investors." For novice buyers, however, the "comparative cheapness of native work" meant an opportunity to trade up: "American work of the best class can be bought by investors with more than a reasonable belief that it will prove profitable should circumstances demand a sale." A dealer quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle</span> returned to the popular land speculation analogy, adding that aside from real estate and stocks, American paintings were the "best property that a man can accumulate." The market promised the rapid appreciation of paintings "you can buy dirt cheap now" but "rich men will bid high for, when you and I have retired."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In other words, American art was a value stock.</p>
<p>The daily press argued the tariff and its politics throughout the late century, contributing to a broad consciousness of global trading and its relation to art economies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>' pro-reductionist position was evident in a reader's comment that "aesthetics and protection simultaneously occupy the New Englander's mind." A stronghold of the Republican Party, the region pointed up arbitrary protariff logic: "Show a New Englander an antique terra cotta lamp … that has lain in the ground for 2000 years, and he will go off in aesthetic ecstatics. Show him the same object as an article of commerce and he at once soberly regards it as a taxable article liable to interfere with home manufactures." The fuller consequence of the tariff manifests itself here, in the market control that established the importance of price in the public mind and also dismantled categories of goods. The intrinsic qualities of things were lost to legislation that grouped paintings with raw materials and food, and set prices of goods according to retaliation and reciprocity. Was the object antiquity, commodity, or both? The answer depended on the way the object was represented, not produced. But who determined that? The state, collector, or public? In 1880, a columnist traced the slippery relation between value and price, made even more arbitrary by state intervention: "Art dealers manage a good deal of hocus pocus to maintain some scale of prices for the paintings of artists who are in the fashion; but nothing is more fictitious or sooner reversible than the value of works of art. Hence it is impossible for Governments to levy taxes on such things, there being no human possibility that officials can be found who are competent to decide upon their value."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>A tariff opponent, the connoisseur and critic James Jackson Jarves described the way government fiat transformed the commodity-state of art in a letter to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>. In 1881, when the duty on paintings was still only ten percent, he cautioned that "arbitrary and illogical" tariff rules defined the value of sculpture, tapestry, and minor arts by material composition. The strategy followed that deployed by Germany in the 1880s to prevent an influx of imported food from America: canned goods were taxed as iron, and hams  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> bagged in linen as fine textiles. Antiquities entering America likewise were "shunted off the free list to the different departments of mere merchandise to which their chief constituent parts are analogous." Bronzes were classed as metal, terra cottas as pottery, each group under "whichever heading will enable the Government to levy the heaviest duty." Tapestries, for example, were subject to a thirty-percent tax if customs officials categorized them by weight with worsted merchandise, or, as Jarves stated, with "stuffs for bodily wear or upholstery." Decorative porcelain was "degraded" to crockery, and thus taxed at the higher rate of household goods. That is, de-aestheticized art objects increased in state revenue value. The processing point at which stuffs became products was the key question argued in the 1882 Tariff Commission debates over the free entry of raw materials, and one reflected in Jarves's statement that foreign fine arts "should be admitted for what they actually are." American art, however, counted as industrial durable goods. In Jarves's estimation, "We have no art that requires protection. Anything that claims to be art and clamors for protection … will be found to be first cousin to manufacture, and should be placed on the same footing."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>"Mr. Havemeyer Paints a Picture" represents the economic circuit joining tariffs, industry, and art [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Drawn from Henry Osborne Havemeyer's combative appearance before the 1899 Congressional Industrial Commission, the cartoon portrays the rotund sugar trust king beside a canvas inscribed with his own testimony, "The mother of all trusts is the customs tariff bill." Infant industry is fed by protectionism, the source of the massive wealth Havemeyer cycled into his preeminent impressionist collection, which included a Monet <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> owned earlier by Berthe Palmer. Language similarly collapsed art and trade. During the 1880s, amidst agitation over the wool tariff, "shoddy," a manufacturing term for cheap wool substitutes made from shredded rags, came into common use among art critics referring to either French Barbizon forgeries or the amorphous "wooly" surfaces of Camille Corot's landscapes. Port cities throughout France planned to establish free "museums" sponsored by American Boards of Trade and the municipalities of Marseilles, Le Havre, and other maritime centers. Their purpose was to exhibit samples of foreign manufactured goods, raw materials, and agricultural products. A display of prices represented inventory too cumbersome for exhibition. The museums were necessary, explained the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>, because the "largest French houses are afraid to trade with America. They have an idea that America is inhabited by savages and is altogether too far out of the way." Art tariff opponents agreed that cultural legislation likewise would reinforce Old World views of the U.S. as inferior and isolated, while perpetuating "our backward arts" and "deformed, abnormal" architecture. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> sharply politicized its criticism by equating the tariff, or "Know Nothingism in art," and mid-century America's virulent nativist movement.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>An informed public followed political wrangling over the tariff during the spring of 1890. A Republican president Benjamin Harrison, and party majorities in the House and Senate, broadly supported William McKinley's bill combining protectionism and reciprocity in a campaign to open the international market to American agricultural and manufactory interests. Expanding the marketplace beyond American borders was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for Republicans an economic and political imperative in 1890, a Congressional election year. An agrarian depression steadily drove their rural constituencies into poverty and toward agrarian radicalism. McKinley's proposal to eliminate the art tariff, and thus induce the French to lift the pork ban, also occurred simultaneously to the American Art Association's national crusade to raise the $34,839 duty on Millet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus,</span> the painting at the center of both bidding and tariff wars. While the Chicago press deplored a revenue system in which the "<span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus</span> is classed with pig-iron and the Venus of Milo with tin-plate," protectionists reminded legislators that after the 1884 art tariff rollback went down in defeat, only seventeen of the fifty two who voted yea were reelected that fall. Boards of Trade in hog and corn-producing states besieged Congress that year, demanding retaliation against luxury goods produced by European nations that "maligned the American hog."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>

<p>For many, the sum of international trade was "cheap food for France and good pictures for the United States." But, French recalcitrance on the pork embargo killed support for "free art," and during the summer of 1890, the Senate Finance Committee returned the "barbarian 30 per cent duty" before striking a final compromise of fifteen percent later that year. Despite widespread notions that all foreign art was taxed in 1890, the law drew a clear distinction between art and its commodity-form on the basis of public and private ownership. Paintings purchased for museums, schools, or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> churches entered free, as did art for public exhibition up to one year. But, as a former Commissioner to the 1876 Centennial and protariff Republican Thomas Donaldson stated in the Philadelphia press, when owners used paintings as "commerce for barter and trade, as silks are, or wines, or iron, or as luxury, they pay duty, as do other commercial commodities or luxuries." Free art was not democratic culture, but social legislation that set the "interest of one class" above the "average citizen." The inequities factored out to the sum of labor's everyday life: "The American workingman returns at night from his toil clad in a woolen suit taxed 55 per cent … a cotton shirt taxed 45 per cent, a woolen hat taxed 75 per cent … He takes up his knife and fork taxed 45 per cent, and begins to eat a piece of salted fish taxed 25 per cent … He ends his meal with a pudding of rice taxed 112 per cent, and an orange taxed 20 per cent."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> The tariff, Donaldson maintained, would stand "rock-ribbed and firm" despite the nonproducing and alien classes determined to open free international art trade: "speculators, foreign governments, foreign ministers, mistaken men, so-called art zealots, long haired men." And, "always New Yorkers."</p>
<p>If American collectors were to profit from free art, why not American producers? That is, if foreign art entered duty free, why not its component materials? Since paintings, like money, had no intrinsic value, the free list should include linseed oils, varnishes, canvas, frames, and gold leaf for their manufacture. At the practical level, current duties on all necessary materials ranging from turpentine to gold leaf slowed productivity at home and placed artists working in America at a disadvantage in the competitive international market. Donaldson's proposal was a page from the central industrial trade debate of 1890, in which the Democratic hardline advocated free raw materials to stabilize the domestic market and boost American manufactory and commercial farming interests abroad.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> He failed to see that the economic distinction between the art-product and its raw state balanced on the cultural difference between high and popular art. Sorting that out was the task confronting the editors and publishers of the illustrated monthly <span style="font-style:italic;">Century Magazine</span>. Before the House Committee of Ways and Means, they challenged the U.S. Treasury Department statute excluding wood blocks prepared for engravings from the roster of finished art. The associate editor Robert Underwood Johnson testified that the educative value of prints justified the free entry of woodblocks engraved abroad for mass reproduction in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Century</span> series "Old Italian Masters." Packaged culture for citizens, however, meant federal revenue for the state. Despite Johnson's protest against classing engravers as artisans (their work was not "mechanical") and the block as raw material ("the art is in it"), the statute stood. By Treasury Department logic, seriality meant commodity, and woodcuts were "simply the means by which an almost unlimited number of impressions constituting pictures could be produced."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>A month later the McKinley Bill captured public attention and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> front page with its contradictory "free art" schedules exempting oil paintings and watercolors as the "professional production of a painter." Artisanal labor was a different story. It allowed for import duties on all forms of mechanical reproduction—lithographs, photographs, and etchings—and a government share in a lucrative mass marketplace. House Democrats  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> eager to make party capital of their own pointed to Republican class legislation: "While the man who has means enough to go abroad to buy pictures is favored, the poor man who desires to ornament his shanty with a foreign colored lithograph will be compelled to pay a tax." Poor man was political shorthand for farmer. And farmers were "hapless creatures" set against "pauper painters" in an "international spectacle." With that, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> let the air out of campaign speeches and flatly stated that hog farmers had no interest in what hung on whose parlor walls. Instead, the farmer was the politician's straw man, spun from the "attributes of that animal which he raises so extensively." The farmer's "violent antipathy" to fine arts and "effeminate compatriots" was election-year humbug, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> declared. "Depraved art" and pork barrels seemed a fair trade. Then again, "hoggishness" might occasion rural protest against "other people's buying pictures when he cannot afford to buy them himself."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>France lifted the American pork ban in December 1891, only to impose prohibitive duties that left farmers in key Republican territories without a foreign market. The free art campaign continued the following year, but this time artist-delegates went to Washington, D.C. as the National Art Association, a lobby organized by the editor Kate Field. When Congressmen disappointed the cause, she won support from the U.S. First Lady Mrs. Benjamin Harrison (Caroline Lavinia Scott), herself a painter. "I saw no reason why my sex should not persevere," Field remarked to the 1892 Committee of Ways and Means. Two years would pass before the tariff ended and Field accepted France's highest honor for service to the arts, the Palmes académique. First, she consolidated Association forces under its officers including past and current presidents of Chicago's Board of Trade and World's Fair Board of Lady Managers respectively, Charles Hutchinson and Berthe Palmer.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Buying Against the Grain</h1>
<p>Representing art and agrarian commodity, Monet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> series was entangled in tariff disputes dividing two groups, American art and industrials supporting the free entry of art versus French industrials and large agriculture closing their market to American wheat. Robert Herbert's critical identification of Monet's images as wheat (not hay) allows us to set Berthe Palmer's purchases between two barriers to global trade in grain, the 1890 McKinley Tariff and the 1892 Méline Tariff.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> By 1891, when Palmer acquired the first of nine <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>, Zola's schoolmaster envisioned French fields "submerged under a food of American wheat" in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, French agricultural profits hit a two-decade low, and big wheat and iron combined in a conservative push for a protective tariff. U.S. House Republicans simultaneously warned that Democratic free trade ideology meant "within ten years great flouring mills would be grinding Indian and Russian wheat on our seaboard." While House subcommittees heard protests against the "Hottentot tax on art," protariff Republicans and the opposition battled over trade barriers to a range of agricultural products, particularly grains. Republicans played to xenophobes, picturing a nation of American farmers "on a level with the Russian, the Indian, the Egyptian." Free trade in barley, oats, and the like would  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> force farmers out of lucrative diversified fields and into one bankable export—wheat. A wheat war would then pit Jefferson's yeoman against his "swarthy competitor, wearing no clothing but a coarse towel, living on rice, and sheltered only by a bamboo hut." The resulting glut in the world market would reduce farm life to subsistence and the farmer to the "peasant serf of Europe and the half-naked ryot of India." As I have suggested elsewhere, Monet profitably created his own laissez faire capitalist market for representations at a moment when protectionism brought trade in the visible supply of grain to a standstill. To foreground the social meaning of Palmer's open trade in Monet's signs for wheat, we may begin with her position as the first American collector to see value in Monet's seriality, and her penchant to flip art "as she and her husband bought and sold real estate."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Palmer was a preeminent society leader, art collector, and philanthropic labor advocate whose patronage extended to the Woman's Trade Union League. She opened her sumptuous gallery to the Chicago Woman's Club reform department in 1910, campaigned to unionize the city's millinery workers, but drew fire from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Socialist</span> for wearing non-union hats. Palmer's activities, everyday and extraordinary, from bargain shopping to a Lusitania crossing, dominated international society pages, which celebrated her as the "only American woman who knows how to spend her money." Born to Southern gentry, she increased her status through marriage to the real estate magnate Potter Palmer, founder of the famed hotel Palmer House. His first fortune, however, derived from the flourishing dry goods business he later sold to Marshall Field. Meant to attract women shoppers, his modern marketing strategies featured luxury goods and imported dresses over everyday stock. Alongside seductive displays, Palmer introduced to women consumers the new opportunity to buy on credit and take purchases home on approval. Berthe Palmer's own business sense led her to nearly double her husband's estate between his death in 1902 and hers in 1916 when her net worth exceeded $15,000,000.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> We can understand how Palmer entered the art-commodity trade, particularly given her husband's stated desire for "pictures he wouldn't lose on," but why the <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>?</p>
<p>During the early 1890s, primarily through Durand-Ruel, Berthe Palmer bought and traded Monet's serial images at a time and place when Chicago Board of Trade speculators "redefined the <span style="font-style:italic;">meaning</span> of grain." We know, for instance, that two canvases she returned to Durand-Ruel, depicting grainstacks in snow, entered the Havemeyer collection in 1894 and 1895.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> As a Chicagoan, Palmer saw that international trade disputes mirrored regional tensions between speculators and grain growers, and mobilized grassroots protest. When she made her purchases in 1891, the U.S. had its largest wheat harvest to date, and the following year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Studio</span> announced the "time for lovers of Monet with small purses has passed." But the Farmers Alliance and its third-party agitation against futures trading also were on the rise. Developed from commodity trade in the late-1860s, futures did not depend on current supplies of physical grain, but the future price of grain yet to be delivered. At stake was the "nature of reality in a speculative economy."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Streams of grain, elevator receipts, futures contracts, and "wind wheat," impressionist grainstacks and Barbizon counterfeits—these were serialities in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> two related speculative worlds that transformed nature through abstract symbols and fictions, and disrupted the marketplace with artificial surplus.</p>
<p>Options trading was a mainspring of agrarian discontent. Unlike futures, options was a largely illegal form of gambling that allowed virtual traders to choose whether or not to make or take delivery of a commodity, depending on market conditions. By the farmer's reckoning, short-selling speculators trading in "phantom" crops did so to drive down the prices of actual harvests. Antioption petitions to Washington, D.C. made plain the agrarian producer's dislocation from a modern market in which "one party agrees to sell what never did and never will exist, and the other agrees to buy what he knows is never to be delivered to him." The aim of options trading, stated opponents, was to "kill off the real article."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Farmers fought back against short-sellers and currency shortages with the Alliance subtreasury plan. Designed in 1889 by Charles Macune, the plan centered on the establishment of government warehouses in counties across the nation that annually produced more than $500,000 in agricultural goods. While waiting for favorable market prices, farmers could store crops in the subtreasuries and borrow up to eighty percent of their current value, issued as government certificates of deposit.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Crop certificates acquired the "character of money" in the populist weekly <span style="font-style:italic;">National Economist</span>, where Alliance supporters contrasted the intrinsic value of corn and the representative value of coin. Money was the "thought of value … a conception and not a commodity," wrote a contributor. Yet others equalized exported crops and money abroad in a continuous stream of representations: "The only difference between gold certificates and the proposed sub treasury certificates is that the former represents gold bullion in our vaults while the latter represents wheat and cotton, that [sic] represents gold coin circulating in Europe."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> When money became a "legal fiction" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Economist</span>, value followed as a "purely relative term" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>. The grain/gold analogy spilled into the daily press, as the Chicago columnist stated, "If a bushel of wheat is exchangeable today for 23 grains of gold and tomorrow can be obtained for 14 grains … the value of the gold has changed relative to the wheat, just as much as the value of wheat has changed relative to gold" [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>].<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Investment capital was thick with grain in the 1890s, thick enough to join and fracture the social economies of speculating and collecting. One of the founders of the original Chicago Board of Trade, Potter Palmer, mastered speculation, but Berthe Palmer manipulated the collection. Hers became a site of profit and critique and a space to aestheticize male commerce performed as open outcry trading so like rivalrous auction bidding. Palmer's own "paper trade" in grain separated product from labor (Monet's and the farmer's), price from value, and commodity from consumption. As Susan Stewart writes, the collection is "not only far removed from contexts of material production; it is also the most abstract of all forms of consumption." This is easily true of speculation. Production in both is displaced by risk, luck and magic, speculation seeking "magical formulas to predict price," and the collection a "magic cycle of self-referential exchange" to fetishize the object. In the trading pit and on the auction stage, prices flow free of goods.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>The similarities that enable us to theorize commodity trading and art collecting as related simulacra already were emerging in nineteenth-century popular thought. Palmer's elite circle could not stop her public comparison to Hetty Robinson Green (both died in 1916) whose mind-boggling $100,000,000 fortune came from capital loans, government bonds, railroad stocks, and Chicago real estate. What fixed the "Witch of Wall Street" in popular imagination, however, were her storied eccentricities. Going about in men's underwear and newspaper petticoats, eating scraps and onions, adopting tenement lodgings and aliases, she dodged the taxman and would-be murderers.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> More importantly, she typed for the public the feminine speculator irrational, as Mary Morgan did the manic collector. As we have seen, business journals today index auction prices as industrials and analyze global reserve contracts alongside global chip sales. Corporate capitalism in 1903 already recognized the "industrial importance" of international art trade, and blurred markets in foreign art and foreign loan sales. Both  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> experienced volatility due to price fixing and hyped potential profits calculated to shop debt to investment consortia and spread out risk: "At the present time there are quotations for pictures as there are quotations on the stock exchange, and this is complicated by fictitious financial operations … People 'launch' a painter as they launch a foreign loan … They buy in his works to prevent a slump in prices. There are 'cracks' and 'booms' and on the bourse—pardon, I mean the salesroom—such and such a painter drops so many points … Bad day for Impressionists … The Monet division felt the bad turn of the market. Degas alone was firm at the conclusion of the day."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>As much as the grain he represented, Monet's seriality positioned Palmer's nine canvases as a commodity-form in a speculative world. His multiples parallel Jefferson's 1785 Land Ordinance, identical one-square-mile sections mapping the democratic space of freeholds and the property lines of real estate. Particularly in Chicago, the "grid turned the prairie into a commodity," and yielded a superabundance of wheat and corn "all held within neatly rectilinear frames."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> series ordered plenitude within Palmer's collection, but control of another kind was the higher stake; and here we must look again at Stewart for whom seriality defines the collection as a "mode of control and containment." The collector, in turn, masters the series by defining its limit.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> If we further understand the collection to "represent experience" as a controlled model, Palmer's patronage becomes a means to compensate for her exclusion from public and male corporate space. In a female interior, the closeted images take on aspects of the fetish. She equalized her "Norman Gothic castle" and the Board's "temple of commerce" through the collector's fantasy [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]. But in its "perfect hermeticism," Palmer's collection sealed itself against labor and history bodied in the 2,000 workers marching just outside against the "Temple of Gambling and Cut-Throatism" [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>].<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>If we consider the series as a lived female experience, we see the full metaphoric power of Palmer's collection. Changing places with things, millionaire widows, unsexed speculators, and unionized stenographers represented three other serialities— money, margin trades, and machines—within and outside exchange economy norms. Organizing the three into a common pathology was the public obsession with serial death surrounding women at the end of the century. The widows of Potter Palmer, Philip Armour, George Pullman, and Marshall Field, collectively Chicago's "Queens of Finance" [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>], were "born commanders," "real society 'bosses,'" according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>. Their "supremacy" derived not from wealth alone but from a self-referential position above "matrimonial rumor." Husbands were decided liabilities in an internal order granting the "single widow" undisputed power over the remarried "widow-bride." When sociologists asked, "What's killing off the Chicago man?" the Board of Health responded with charts and tables predicting an "Adamless Eden, dominated by a masterful race of Amazons." Anxiety at female sexual and economic independence was measured in declining marriage and male birth rates as well as an increase in male deaths. The "total extinction of the male sex" soon would reduce man to a "museum freak to be stared at by the Chicago Amazon who proves her sex fitness for survival." The final reemergence of her "atavistic tendencies" would complete her evolution; and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">as a "race, woman again might rise to that uni-sexual state that somewhere in the past she occupied preeminently to the exclusion of the male type." Little wonder that the press regarded Palmer to be "her own general."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfixed gender positions drove public discourse against women speculators, particularly in 1899 when Lenore Hattie Linblom became the first nominated to the Board of Trade. Sunday sermons on "Gambling with Bread" denounced grain speculation as the "dirtiest gambling of all," but for that reason the Board became guardians of female virtue. "The path of moral rectitude for a woman, even in these days of voting," set her above male commerce and "it is presumably on this ground that the regular board bars women from membership," advised the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>. More to the point, women speculators troubled domestic ideology by gambling on "fluctuating fortunes of May wheat instead of darning the children's stockings or helping them with their lessons." A natural female  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> instinct for speculation, however, was "amply proved by the manner in which women have always speculated about their neighbors' business." Women of means traded from the Exchange galleries open to the public since the 1893 Chicago World's Fair; but class identity destabilized in bucket shops, illegal gambling rooms (some for women only) where patrons could bet on commodity prices without buying into the market. A "motley collection" representing "types of femininity, of both high and low degree," bucket shop women offered an urban spectacle "safer than slumming." Yet reporters warned of other dangers in the "poisonous" shops, the crowds that "infest" them, and the "rotten, disease-laden air" they breathe [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>].<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>Described as a passion, mania, or fever, and likened to an "opium or hasheesh habit," the social pathologies of female speculation were medicalized. Popular theory typed women speculators by premature aging—hollow eyes, wrinkles, crow's feet, sallow skin, and gray hair—leading to "aching hearts and unhappy homes." Over-excited by their trades, women developed nervous ailments including tremens and bulging eyes. Even worse, speculating robbed them of a "calm and untroubled frame of mind calculated for the practice of domestic virtues." Here was the true threat, the "death to sentiment." Like their French sister, the speculating <span style="font-style:italic;">lorette</span>, these traders collapsed male and female identities. First to fall were "social pleasure and distinction, fear, hysteria, the servant-girl question and numberless other luxuries dear to the feminine heart." Masculinized traders took their losses "as indifferently as the nerviest dealer among men." They called out quotations with a "voice like a brakeman," often trading to "support an idle, worthless man who should himself be out in the world earning a living." Gender reversals crossed class lines into the Exchange gallery where delicate women lost the "impulsive character that controls the gentler sex," and coolly signaled their brokers while male traders below "shrieked frantically."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>Through bucket shops, exchange galleries, and brokerage firms, the popular classes and women now invaded a financial world long dominated by men of privilege. Inheritance, investment, and a modern urban work force empowered women with their own money, and reified their challenge to economic order. That was the subversion that "obliterates feminine characteristics." A double slippage from woman to man to woman to machine, female speculators were prosthetics engineered from gender and technologic modernities. Their umbilical connection to the ticker through its tape, its hypnotically streaming quotations, deadened them to "all the finer feelings of their womanhood." An "automatic vampire" that drained women of femininity, the ticker and its eroticized dangers became gendered in early twentieth-century cautions to the male trader to "divorce himself from [its] alluring attractions."<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Opposition to the ticker in the 1890s centered on its potential to democratize the market by telegraphing quotes from the pit to the public in bucket shops across the city. Anxiety at machinic dominance played out again in the late-1990s when cybertrading emerged as a serious threat to Chicago's decidedly male open outcry tradition. The noisy rough-and-tumble of pit "culture," its traders, runners, and clerks, its heart-pounding gains and losses, its face-to-face shouts, gestures, and hand signals, seemed doomed as insiders wondered if adopting a full electronic platform "could be creating a monster."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>In late nineteenth-century Chicago, women representing new technology became victims of its monstrous forms. An estimated fifty stenographers, or "typewriters," some of whom he married, numbered among countless women murdered by the serial killer H. H. Holmes (Herman Webster Mudgett). The 1893 Chicago World's Fair gave rise to both stenography, a modern female occupation, and the "Holmes Castle," a makeshift hotel that concealed behind its battlements the ghastly machines, deadly gases, and electrical systems of a "murder factory." Reduced to ash and dissolved in acid, traces of female corporeality lingered only in articulated skeletons. Simultaneously to mass murder, serial identity reproduced itself through labor mutuality. In 1892, Palmer organized the National Association of Women Stenographers, a health benefits association for 200 members that later grew into the Chicago Business Woman's Club.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>A year after the Fair, the British reformer William T. Stead published <span style="font-style:italic;">If Christ Came to Chicago</span>, his classic exposé of urban vice and corruption. It ends in 1900, and a utopic future including an eight-hour day, free medical care, and skyscraper cooperative housing. Marshall Field donates his store to the public, George Pullman transports convalescents to the lakeshore, and Berthe Palmer governs as mayor. Under her leadership, "millionaires no longer kept their treasures of art to themselves." Chicago's poor now visited its mansions to share in the "picture galleries of the richest millionaires on Prairie Avenue." The law guaranteed public rights to private collections, and the rich who locked their doors were charged with stealing culture from fellow citizens.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Palmer opened her art gallery to industrial labor in 1907, hosting a conference under the auspices of the National Civic Federation. Then the largest of its kind in Chicago history, the meeting crossed classes to include "600 men and women—multimillionaires, capitalists, single taxers, labor leaders, socialists, settlement workers, students, professors, and society leaders … packing house workers, structural iron workers, and brakemen." They gathered to discuss a Chicago branch of the Federation, which claimed its founding principle to be class harmony through capital and labor conciliation. Not only did a complex anti-union machine operate behind the Federation, Chicago monopolists Cyrus McCormick and J. Ogden Armour galvanized its power to break radical labor. The popular press headlined an amusing carnivalesque, "Capital Bearded by Labor in Castle of Mrs. Palmer," de-politicized in frothy scenes of starched shirt fronts and patent leathers mixing with cloth coats and brogans. Above the classes, Palmer "reigned as if by a magic wand" [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>]. In an open letter to Palmer, Mother Jones declared the event "useless," and the Socialist papers bluntly called it "grotesque." The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Socialist</span> ridiculed Palmer's earlier charity ball, and the "hundreds of underpaid clerks and straw bosses [who] left the grand affair determined to defend the 'rich' and the system under which working people are forced to support idlers to the last ditch." Now, workers bitterly observed her "hopes to capture the labor leaders of Chicago and the nation by giving them a pink tea in her beautiful home."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup></p>
<p>We end here as we began, with Chicago's roiling labor economy. Palmer drew the outside in; through her collection she privatized class struggle, first containing commodity and then labor. Never mind the bakers' strike and "boss bakers," police, and workers who bloodied Chicago streets over poisoned bread a week before her labor conference. The question remains, how can we fix Monet's <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> between the collector's dream and the worker's world? We can't, and there resides the power of open-ended ideology. Monet's place in an American collection floats on Jameson's lyric analysis of impressionist prose. Writing impressionism means writing past ideology, "awakening an alien space beyond it, founding a new and strange heaven and earth."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> represented the strange earth of speculation, its fragments and series, its cyclical economy turning grain into gold and back again through the unending circulation of commodities. When strikes and tariffs emptied stores of value, even bread itself, Monet visualized the alien space beyond consumption [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>]. In today's global market art is an "asset class" comparable to Treasury bonds; and art investment, after the hedge-fund model, is moving beyond speculation to "securitization." That is, shared losses and gains among group investors, including the artist, in which "risks are traded rather than owned." The <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span>, however, remain a sign for the unreality and exuberance of moneyless transactions. In spring 2007, Sotheby's partnered with GE Money and rolled out its branded MasterCard to initiate credit card purchases at auctions. Among the designs available to elite cardholders was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Grainstacks</span> stamped into their plastic above the MasterCard logo. Sotheby's since has quietly dropped the program. When the Fall 2008 art auctions flattened in New York City under a global credit crisis and historic federal bailouts, market watchers focused on Sotheby's sale of seventy-one impressionist works as the season's bellwether. There followed the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
