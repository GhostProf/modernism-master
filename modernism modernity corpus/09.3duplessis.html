Culturalist readings analyzing how social debates and meanings are inscribed in art works and ancillary texts must not&#8212;and need not&#8212;lose formal specificity or overlook the nuanced, pleasurable textiness of texts. The challenge of reading twentieth-century poetry in relation to modernity is to find a method of mediation between what is said <i>in</i> poetry and what is said <i>as</i> poetry, a method that attends to the interdependent mesh of a text's social and aesthetic aspects. Otherwise a poetic text has to be seen reductively as a bizarre choice of message delivery system for ideas&#8212;something inexplicably quirky and rather less effective than writing polemic or "sending a telegram." Paraphrasable meaning is hardly all a reader seeks and authorial claims of what is intended cannot illuminate all a text's territory or its effects.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Hence, one must use a postformalist reading strategy willing to look at the deep formal mechanisms of literary texts with a kind of "New Critical" care, yet linking formal moves to the issues that purist new criticism rejected: social substance, biographical traces, constructions of subjectivity, historical debates, and ideological strata. My position&#8212;shown in a particular way in my recent book on modern poetry&#8212;is that language choices, forms, and the making of poetic artifacts can be read in relation to subjectivity, cultural ideology, and social circumstance, to echo Susan Wolfson.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 I have called this kind of culturalist close reading a social philology.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>


<p>
Further, one specific activist strand of cultural criticism that has contributed to new modernist studies&#8212;that is, gender studies or feminist criticism&#8212;has, as part of its "repoliticization of the aesthetic sphere," insisted on the examination of gendered 
<b></b>
materials in the apparatus of poesis.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 This means not only looking at institutions around poetry (patronage, publication, reception, canonizing trends, coterie groups, poetic careers), but also analyzing cultural conventions and institutionalized topoi inside poetry that have a gendered torque. One part of the apparatus of poesis is the relation of gendered muse to poet. This is a particularly fraught site because it involves cultural convention, biographical materials, literary representation, and their reinvention in any particular situated case. That is, subject positions such as "muse" or "inspired by a muse" appear variously in poetic tradition as res and in real life as biographical choices and activities ideologically and culturally available to people situating themselves inside careers.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Other gendered materials in the apparatus of poesis include the subject positions of poet, poetess, and genius, what is played out in each, and how these interactive postures emerge inside texts and in ancillary situations at historically determinate times. These subject positions are culturally institutionalized and personally, if unevenly, internalized&#8212;as shown in Svetlana Boym's work on the tropes of femininity in "the death of the poetess," which examines her character as a mix of excess and lack, and Barbara Johnson's work on "male [poet's] privilege as the right to play femininity."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 These positions can emerge in texts as recurrent but variable motifs, topoi that are necessarily susceptible to some kind of situational reading because of the mix of social, ideological, and even historical materials condensed in them.

<p>
A glance at one-frame cartoons, whether in <i>The New Yorker</i> or elsewhere, will convince anyone of the ideological persistence of muse motifs (often red in relation to visual artists): at its most banal, this is a beneficent, lovely, noble, and saintly female re who inspires a male artist, yet who may capriciously and inexplicably, or pedagogically, withhold favors causing artistic blockage or further growth. There are also parodic and satiric uses of muse motifs that depend on our sense of the convention. The interplay between passivity and activity, initiator and recipient seems to run counter to gender stereotype, raising the issue that&#8212;in a kind of Dinnersteinian historical psychology&#8212;the muse has her psychological origin in the imprint of the powerful mother on the needy baby.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Considering the muse in his 1994 "Gendering the Muse," Jed Rasula has proposed the re as embodying the hope of surpassing one's own limits, thus acknowledging the creative self as hybrid&#8212;a gender hybrid. He builds a mythopoetic argument that what we call the muse is the site of a poet's own embedded otherness. Poetry takes shape in an "underwriting" or "underwritten" guarantee of "male poetic authority" by a "differently gendered" voice "pre-articulated inside" a poet. But once the "muse" is thus interpreted as a metaphor for an interior projection of power that allows one to hybridize oneself, there is no particular reason for it to manifest any gender narrative. Rasula speculates why it would.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 For male poets, the sense of having another growth inside is a male imitation of the feelings women have if and when they are successfully pregnant, since "that men don't give birth is one of the more thoroughly repressed of cultural traumas."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 This formulation does not straightforwardly transfer to women poets, but it does foreground gender conventions in the apparatus of poesis and might suggest that looking for the "repressed gender traumas" of women would be a place in which to speculate transhistorically about muse res 
<b></b>
for females. Rasula presents the primal scene of poesis not as maternal nourishment, nor sublimated sexual intercourse, nor eroticized chastity, but as imitative pregnancy: a couvade of a semi-autonomous otherness that speaks from the inside.

<p>
This formulation is suggestive, but, even granting some of this synoptic generalization, I want to be a little less archetypal and more situational. Any muse re used in a particular poem or life is still based in specific gender relations that are sustained, remixed, and activated in historical time by individuals seeking to establish their creative agency. Thus I want here to undergeneralize, even myopically, and offer a close reading of a well-known poem in order to discuss a female re as represented by one male writer, reading both his investment in this re and her own qualities.

<p>
Theodor Adorno is one critic to whom it is necessary to turn for an analysis of how social materials emerge in poetic texts. While most critics of poetry have maintained, until quite recently, a resistance to any analyses of poetry's political and ideological representations, Adorno's 1957 essay, "On Lyric Poetry and Society" argues that the subject of a poem (the "I," generally) speaks indirectly about a social meaning or contradiction.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 My thesis, says Adorno, "is that the lyric work is always the subjective expression of a social antagonism" ("OLP," 45). The final pages of "On Lyric Poetry and Society" analyze two poems with strong muse-poet relations, interpreting the epiphanic luminosity and personal yearning in Eduard M&ouml;rike and Stefan George as desires inscribed in reverse for community and utopic change. These, however, are peculiarly unsatisfying analyses. 
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>


<p>
One analysis, of a poem by M&ouml;rike that speaks of a little town and the streets, flowers, blossoms, and breezes found there, suggests "the paradox of lyric poetry in the ascending industrial age" ("OLP," 50). The lyric rises to epiphanic flashes of comfort and pleasure that restore (via a cosy town and a domesticated, accessible nature) a sense of psychic equilibrium and hope to an individual. That poem finishes, in the English translation, "Oh muse, you have touched my heart, / With a breath of love!" ("OLP," 48). The second lyric cited by Adorno is George's twelve line poem about a desirable "object," as they say: "from a moist night / a gleam ignites . . . Now I must / For your eyes and hair / Every day / Live in yearning." These four lines, heard by Adorno as "some of the most irresistible lines in German poetry," are saved in the English translation from their own sweet and normative banality by the imagination of the non-normative love object whom the male poet addresses ("OLP," 53). Male ephebe-mentor relations structure a masculinity and a femininity without women.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
For Adorno, lyric language, with its burden of erotic longing for the other, "represents the idea of a free humankind"; erotic yearning is a way of saying political yearning ("OLP," 53). Yearning and love are absolutized, set out as an unquestionable part of the apparatus and mechanism of lyric poetry. The "Oh muse," the "breath of love" in one poem, and the "live in yearning" of the other lead to and provoke social interpretation for Adorno, but they are not seen by him as what needs to be interpreted. Erotic yearning does not have an epidemiology, nor private emotions a history. The poetic conventions re-presented or evoked in "Oh muse," in "breath of love," and "live in yearning" are taken for granted. (Or, as my students sometimes write, taken for 
<b></b>
granite.) What do these words mean? What is muse in any poem? What is love as a specific poem represents it? Has Adorno desocialized these eminently conventional (that is, social) elements of poetry so he can transpose them to what he assumes to be more "social" forms and practices&#8212;those of community and utopia?

<p>
This avoidance is connected with another: the finesse with which Adorno avoids or sidesteps mentioning the situation of love-yearning and muse-relations most generally produced in the lyric poem as a genre: one that uses female res. That is, if the M&ouml;rike poem is about a rush of heightened feeling for the (Wordsworthian) "sense sublime / Of something far more deeply interfused" inside a single individual touched with a muse's blessing, and if the George poem is about male love-yearning for a male adolescent ephebe (a fact that Adorno knows well, as he himself alludes to the Maximin cult), then the issue of the lyric and its construction of female objects, and the issue of poetic muses and the female gender have been distinctly avoided in this analysis (ibid.).

<p>
The gaze on the beloved, the heterosexual object of yearning, the scrutiny of the female re&#8212;the anatomy of Her beauties or intellectual perfections, the yearning for something she represents, the evocation of love and situations of courtship, the inspiration of that re&#8212;all parts of the "foundational cluster" of the lyric, all central to the lyric, are not taken up by Adorno. That is, missing from Adorno's analysis are heterosexual yearning and burning and the construction of semi-mythological muses out of actual females; Petrarchan topoi simple or complicated; poems addressed to women or that construct female res inside the text; poems that help to structure female and male as gender ideas; and the representing or slanting of gender ideas that contribute to poetry as such. Is this an implicit argument that "personal" love, or muse-poet relations, and normative gender materials of poetry have no social meaning unless they are an allegory of community? Such muse/heterosexual love tropes also deserve readings of their social imprint and implications.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>


<p>
Of course, it is possible that such issues are "imprinted in reverse" on the Adorno essay; such an obvious lacuna might be investigated for its evidence. Perhaps the status of women in the world was changing so drastically in the years of these poems, the years from romanticism to modernism, that Adorno could not get a settled social position on these matters from the evidence of poems and hence made no comment. Nonetheless this enormous gap in Adorno's essay shows how crucial it is that culturalist readings of the gendered materials inside the apparatus of poesis be made.

<p>
A reading of Ezra Pound's "Portrait d'une Femme"  is undertaken here because this canonical work models gendered ideology concerning creativity, elaborating that part of the apparatus of poesis called "the muse."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 By tracing the actual addressee of this poem and contrasting her achievements with those that Pound has selected to depict, I wish to show how his "propounded" form of modern maleness and, more loosely, of poetic genius, depend as subject positions on proposing and maintaining a dehistoricized, despecified female re. This critique does not debate his right to write the poem he wants or needs to write, but rather examines of what that need consists, and points to the ways this poem reaffirms conservatizing gender 
<b></b>
narratives through individual necessity and the personal choices of a poet. The poem lets us examine specific functions attributed to femaleness and maleness in the apparatus of poesis.

<p>
<i>Une</i> is unspecific, not <i>La Femme</i>; with no name given, this "femme" is discussed as a limited muse, a semi-adequate inspiration for a functioning artist, someone whom the speaker must treat elegiacally, regretfully, and from a position of farewell. In this "portrait," with its allusions to visual art even in the French of the title and, of course, to both James's novel of passion, entrapment, renunciation, and collections, and to Pound's admiration of James's ethical realism as a model for poetry, Pound proceeds by deeply interested interpretations&#8212;indeed, repressions&#8212;of the historically attested work of a specific creative woman. He represents his female re within the text as virtual lack, inadvertent creativity, and compromised ability. Attention to both poetic parties inside and outside this poem provides an understanding of these gendered "micropolitics of literary culture."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<p>
The female of "Portrait d'une Femme" is, in Pound's depiction, a semi-bourgeoise proto-bohemian, having rejected marital loyalty to "one dull man, dulling and uxorious." She is an older salonniere who holds court, but whose materials are so piled up, impacted, "dimmed," and "tarnished" that they seem virtually useless. Yet the re surprises the speaker by what she can give to others, and by her "patience" at collecting or letting stuff pool around her. The muse motif is strongly, if secularly, articulated.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
. . . now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.

<br />
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you

<br />
And takes strange gain away. . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the metaphors here are Jamesian, the speaker of the poem sits in some judgment of the re being portrayed; there is no particular hint of bachelor impotence in the speaker's voice, but rather a kind of elegant, summary, appreciative condescension. The Jamesian images of paying and double-edged interest and the sense of possession still conclude in "nothing": that "in the whole and all, / Nothing that's quite your own. / Yet this is you." Having the final line be a two-beat hemistich (after a passage of iambic pentameter) dramatizes this inadequacy. Being an unpossessive conduit is a precise description of the "conditions of employment" for a muse re.

<p>
In the enunciation, Pound brings the whole tradition of Shakespearean blank verse&#8212;the articulate packing of the line, the mobile caesura, the personable, meditative tone, the Renaissance diction with its "mandrakes" and "ambergris"&#8212;to bear witness both to this female re's inspiration and to her passivity. The female re is the site at which such bisexually fertile images as "pregnant with mandrakes" (giving birth to phallic materials) and "ambergris" (an excretion of sperm whales used for perfume) can be articulated, and taken as the "gain" of the male speaker. The female object can manifest or exude these goods, but cannot claim or use them. Thus the poem presents the homosocial bonding of Shakespeare and Pound (in the enunciation) over the body of the female re in the enounced, one who inspires genius but cannot herself create.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<b></b>
The diction is highly motivated: the supplement of Shakespearean tonality supports Pound's own genius subject position. By its diction, the poem is taken out of time; it has created a magic world where no modern markers intrude, no technology, no motor horns, no signs of modernity in the language. The only time marker alludes to the re's age. The line "London has swept about you this score years" reduces the re's agency as it notes her long-lasting presence.

<p>
Thoroughly static, and like a stall and trap for ships (the Sargasso Sea), the female re of the enounced is a spot at which a terrific amount of detritus and rich materials passively collect and jumble. The re lacks center and teleological energies; she is only a dump or midden, "naturally" accumulating debris: something indicated in the long, synactically flexible list in the second half of the poem. And yet, while she is taxed for unoriginality, she is (appropriately, in 1912) inventing collage: accumulating fragments, juxtaposing these, resisting representational design, foregrounding the detail, combining the old and new ("strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff"). Thus the speaker describes the re as proposing, semi-consciously, a major strategy of modernist presentation but in a retro "Victorian" bric-&agrave;-brac mode.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 The poem becomes a muted, backhanded tribute. In the strain of the thrice-repeated word "strange," the speaker acknowledges this artistic mode while disparaging its source.

<p>
"Great minds have sought you&#8212;lacking someone else. / You have been second always." These are the most ferocious lines in an otherwise temperate statement, making her into an apparent stopgap in a narrative of inspiration or romance. These issues can be further enlarged when the poem's historical addressee is identified. Florence Farr is the original of the "portrait d'une femme," and the poem is a Poundian redaction of this New Woman of striking cultural force from a generation before his.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 A. Walton Litz calls Farr an embodiment of an Ibsen type of "'transitional' woman," but certainly more than "Shaw's 'lover' and chosen mouthpiece, Yeats's musical muse, [or] Pound's passive sitter for his twentieth-century version of a Jamesean portrait."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Beyond the interest in this historical woman, I am methodologically interested in the tone, mechanisms, and materiality of the poem as artifact and will not import "facts" about the identification of Farr as if they could prove or disprove the poem's force. Indeed, the gap, contradiction, and interplay between the depiction of the female re and Farr's work give the most information to this reading.

<p>
Florence Farr [Emery] (1860-1917) was an actress, a socialist, a theosophist, a feminist, and (in her final years) an educator in Sri Lanka. Farr was friend of and co-author with Olivia Shakespear (Pound's future mother-in-law), friend and inspiration of George Bernard Shaw (his <i>Arms and the Man</i> was written for her), singer for and inspiration of W. B. Yeats, an actress, novelist, and polemicist&#8212;and taken, in her time, as a quintessential New Woman. Farr played the character Rebecca West in the 1891 London premiere of Ibsen's <i>Rosmersholm</i> and, in 1907, published a series of six essays treating Ibsen's heroines as if they were real female types with contemporary problems, doing striking character analyses of their motivations and passions. As she moved into the Yeats orbit from the Shaw orbit&#8212;a serious shift&#8212;Farr produced one Yeats play in 1894, and acted in others in 1899 and 1905.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 She was active with Yeats in 
<b></b>
Golden Dawn occult and mystical performances, and the recipient of his letters from 1895 through 1906.

<p>
While she emphatically "inspired," she also emphatically possessed and deployed considerable artistic and critical agency. Farr was an emergent New Woman with emancipatory flair, one of those "heroines of modernity" in Rita Felski's terms, who gives the lie to implicit claims of many theories of modernity "that women were situated outside processes of history and social change." As such, this poem allows us real purchase on the problem of reading "the modern in relation to gender politics."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 As a woman who played the muse but also mused the play, she situated herself on both sides of the muse-agent compact. Perhaps her passionate inspiring of these men was a useful cover for her active agency. Perhaps, more likely, for females entering modernity such as Farr, artistic agency and erotically-charged inspiring were mixed with free love bravura, giving tremendous professional power and satisfaction in ways that the pure stereotyped form of "muse" wisdom-in-passivity-and-sublimation cannot articulate. In the 1890s, Farr's intellectual or cultural allegiances were in a "debate" between spiritualist, theosophical practices of esoteric "religious" forms and socialist critiques of bourgeois life: that is, she made herself the container of debate between these two rival world views. In biographical terms this debate was enacted between Yeats and Shaw, who each regretted the influence of the other on Farr.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Yet because the theosophical was also very feminist in implication, with its priestesses and goddesses, offering women adepts paths of spiritual power and cultic status, and because the anti-bourgeois socialist asked a number of telling questions about women's status, one might see Farr's position as synthesizing elements concerning female power and critique from these two rival worldviews.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 When Litz summarizes her 1907 <i>New Age</i> articles and publishes her Ibsen character portraits (also from 1907), he argues for her primal embodiment of Ibsen's ideas on women's passionate striving&#8212;sexually, intellectually, socially, in the world, and in the family.

<p>
It is the Yeats aspect of Farr's life&#8212;her sexual, productive, and professional life&#8212;that interested Pound; he met Farr in 1909 at the Poets' Club as he was hoping to enter Yeats's orbit himself.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Farr, a noted performer, had been known for chanting Yeats' poems to an instrument "half-lyre, half-psaltery" (made for her by Arnold Dolmetsch), an activity that the two took very seriously from about 1901 to 1905.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 She wrote music that Yeats was very eager to see included in a 1907 edition of his plays; some of which does appear in "Speaking to the Psaltery," from 1907, an essay that also contains a section by Farr. (<i>L,</i> 491-4). Yeats defended their music-of-poetry practice in letters to both Robert Bridges  and Arthur Symons . Yeats and Farr gave lecture-demonstrations in a number of cities to showcase her "extraordinarily impressive and poetical" method of <i>sprechstimme</i>; in 1907 she toured America giving lectures on music and poetry.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Mark Morrisson has recently commented upon how Farr's artistic elocution helped to focus modernist poetics on "the impersonal performance of the pure voice."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Farr's book <i>The Music of Speech</i>  solidified her position as an expert in both the theory and practice of the relation of poetry and music; it is notable that this book was dedicated to Yeats and Arnold Dolmetsch. Pound 
<b></b>
was also doing his research on the relation of music and poetry, possibly impelled by, inspired by, or catching up to this Yeats-Farr-Dolmetsch cluster of activity. Pound's essays-in-tribute to Dolmetsch date from 1918, one of which is filled with hearty allusions to belatedness.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Through the years from about 1909 to 1910, Pound seems to have had a sense of rivalry with Farr, an interest in focusing Yeats's attention on himself in an area in which Farr had significant professional expertise.

<p>
While seeming like a romance/muse plot in the poem, the speaker's line to "Farr" as "femme," "Great minds have sought you&#8212;lacking someone else," can be reseen as an articulation of Pound's rivalry with Farr signaling Pound's desire to displace Farr's analysis of the musical performance of poetry with Pound's (the "someone else") in the sight of Yeats, the great mind.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 The speaker of Pound's poem seems to allude to Pound's own desire to catch up with these influential music-and-poetry ideas, the poem itself offering the sub-rosa claim that the Farr-based re (and covertly, her work) had, by 1912, become collective property, belonging to us. This is suggested in the pun propelled by an emphatic, odd line break: "I have seen you sit / Hours" becoming "I have seen you sit[,] / [ours]." This line also alludes to Pound's construction of a homosocial bond between Yeats and himself via Farr, instead of an oedipal Pound looking at the intense couple Farr and Yeats, a couple professionally and at times sexually active. Indeed, the plethora of art-objects in the poem, the wash of furniture and stuff, might be thought of as being precisely <i>not</i> about music, a deflection from the medium in which Pound's actual rivalry with Farr was expressed. On displacing Farr, Pound may have been celebrating some real life satisfaction in this poem: Yeats wrote to Lady Gregory in December 1910 that "this queer creature Ezra Pound, who has become really a great authority on the troubadours, has, I think, got closer to the right sort of music for poetry than Mrs. Emery [Farr]." Although Pound "can't sing" and sounds like a "very bad phonograph," Yeats nonetheless accepts him as a belated, amusing, but sincere collaborator.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 No matter the biographical facts of Farr's agency, originality, and influence on music-poetry thinking, and her spurring of Pound's interest, the poem constructs "femme" as having become inadequate, displaceable.

<p>
At the beginning of his "Treatise on Metre," written in 1934, several decades after Farr's death, Pound has another last word. Pound positions himself as having performed a great service&#8212;a troubadour-like service&#8212;in this music/poetry nexus: "I heard a fair lady sigh, 'I wish someone would write a good treatise on prosody.' As she had been a famous actress of Ibsen, this was not simple dilettantism. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 This is again, of course, a portrait, by Pound, of the unnamed Farr as female re. In this comment, he honors Farr; yet his honoring has two conflicting dimensions. He mentions her fame and her work (which nonetheless exist far away in the past perfect&#8212;"had been"), but focuses on her "fair lady" needs, whose desirous "sighs" (a metaphor from romance) he is about to satisfy with his knowledge of prosody. The phrase "not <i>simple</i> dilettantism" (emphasis added) raises the damaging specter of <i>complex</i> dilettantism, certainly a possible reading of Farr's life and one reading of all the floating stuff in the poem (as the remains of the dilettante). But Pound's raising the specter of the dilettante at all, rather than the fact of Farr's professional expertise, is reductive, and a 
<b></b>
striking choice in 1934, when the wench, so to speak, is dead. Farr's expertise is thus something that Pound had at once imitated in his criticism and carefully, jealously reduced both in the portrait and twenty-two years after, in his remarks prefacing "Treatise on Metre."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>


<p>
The particular mechanism in Pound's poem has to do with the repositioning of female work. The word "work" appears in the poem as a noun: the female re is not depicted as working, but as someone who sits in the vicinity of "the loom of days" and whose visitors find around her "tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work," an accomplishment without agency, for which she is not visibly responsible. The poem itself is a mechanism that separates Farr from her work (in acting, in writing, in theorizing song and performance), while it claims as collective property anything found, pooled, or caught near this female "Sargasso" re as geographical site; the poem is as if under admiralty law, with the speaker claiming the right of salvage to whatever is washed up. Some form of "possession" of Farr and her work&#8212;parallel to her work with Shaw and then Yeats&#8212;marked a male artist as central in status; Pound's tactic is to take this work and to insist on the passivity of the muse rather than the push-pull activity of male and female cultural workers.

<p>
Pound produces his work (this poem) by the thematic occlusion inside it of the work of the woman (Farr) on whom the poem is based. Farr at fifty-two years in 1912 was still a token of enough importance or suggestiveness so that one might discuss, in the poem, or produce in the poem, her marginalization. This is visible in Pound's allusive word-layering: the speaker of the poem shows ambivalence toward the female re's power in the minor phallicism of the phrase "strange spars of knowledge," from the "bright ships"&#8212;by simultaneously adducing her lack, in the word "sparse," but also acknowledging how the re "spurs" the speaker on. "Spars" may also be a noun meaning the act of sparring, disputing, boxing, or contending with words. This shadow of possible debate or sparring and the eloquence of the re&#8212;or of Farr as model&#8212;is also very suggestive, given her own passionate analyses of female passions, sex and gender struggles, and women's "burning will and striving intellect"&#8212;a Keatsian/Yeatsian phrase she uses to describe the character of Rebecca West in the "Ibsen's Women" series ("FF," 94).

<p>
The poem's mechanisms propose a solution not only to Farr's talents on the music-poetry scene, but to her "problematic" feminist opinions as well. Farr's other 1907-8 articles were full of feminism: the feminism of women active and independent for the (eugenic) good of the race; the pleasures and dangers of sexual expression; and the outrage of the "economic bargain" women must make in marriage ("FF," 88-9). In her essays on Ibsen, the one word that recurs is "passion," and she is exact about what Ibsen came to represent in the way of radical, tragic striving of women whose passions and social spaces did not coincide. Farr speaks of women "bored by marriage," with "dim yearnings for an intellectual comradeship with men"; whose lives are bounded by "Suburbia"; who struggle against "social convention"; and who have a particular resistance to the insincere "general atmosphere of mutual flattery" that characterizes the bourgeois "home as an institution" ("FF," 92, 98). Farr argues for open relationships,
<b></b>
as "social units constantly subject to change," wherein men and women can attain "a more vivid existence" through rejecting the "little stagnant pools" of their mandated ties ("FF," 98). This rejection of stagnation is precisely opposite to that stasis with which, in the "Sargasso" metaphor, Pound taxes Farr.

<p>
The "Sargasso Sea muddle" that gives Pound his image (or that echoes a metaphor already in the poem) also appears in Dorothy Shakespear's comments upon Florence Farr's 1912 novel, <i>The Solemnization of Jacklin: Some Adventures on the Search for Reality.</i> Dorothy Shakespear's comments of July 1912 reiterate Pound's sentiments about Farr, while also repeating his Sargasso Sea image. Engaged to be married to Pound (they were to marry in April 1914), Dorothy is clearly provoked by Farr's essayistic fulminations on marriage and the market value of women.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 In Pound's poem, Farr's principled suspicion of marriage emerges, weakened, as the re's choice to avoid boring middle-class "uxoriousness." But although <i>The Solemnization of Jacklin</i> is more a watered-down Meredithian study of a female's search for experience than an anti-marriage novel, still Farr's work does contain studied passages that offer stiff and radical New Woman critiques of marriage for its "Commercial Aspect," and of women for their degraded complacency in economic slavery&#8212;offering sexual services for money whether outside marriage or inside it. "Why was it, she asked herself, that it was impossible for women to make money as easily as men did; why was it always slavery or marriage for them? . . . She suddenly realised that she belonged to a race of creatures maintained for the pleasure they could give their masters&#8212;their paymasters" is one such heartfelt and bitter chunk, linking prostitution and marriage as parts of the same sex-gender system (<i>SJ,</i> 73). Of these revelations and others, Farr's narrator remarks: "Poor Jacklin [the heroine] woke to this situation in the year 1904, long before the women's movement had any driving power behind it" (<i>SJ,</i> 74). This date is not meant to be comically ironic, although it sounds that way to us; during the years Pound knew her (1909-12), Farr was rather cheered by feminism's driving power for social and political change.

<p>
This novel is dedicated "To the Man Who Shall Be," suggesting that a subject position like New Man should follow upon the New Woman. But the novel also sits in judgment of the reckless female main character for her disparate variety of yearnings&#8212;Fabian, independent, decadent, woman as "the slave of emotion" (<i>SJ,</i> 241). The novel ends with the remarriage of the original couple after various overheated flings and a child from one of those flings sitting with them: "husband and wife looked at each other with eyes full of mutual charity" (<i>SJ,</i> 248). Thus Farr's Ibsenish opinions were rather tempered by a narrative compromise around the marriage plot engineered by the author&#8212;hardly a totally radical solution.

<p>
It is probably irrelevant to discuss Farr's <i>Modern Woman: Her Intentions</i>  at any length because the sheer fact of a fervent, public feminist book stating "This is to be the Woman's Century" only two years before Pound wrote his poem may be all we need to appreciate his work of interpretive erasure in the making of the poem.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Or, at best, we can take the poem as indicating in encoded metaphors his view of Farr's declamations on marriage, prostitution, the vote, economic independence, love, divorce,
<b></b>
and chosen motherhood as pass&eacute;ist trappings, possibly what is referred to as "strange spars of knowledge," "some curious suggestion," and "fact that leads nowhere." At the very least, her book touches topically upon many of the political, social, personal, and moral issues of this central period of feminist struggle. Farr's book is an enthusiastic polemic on many topics, but especially on how the t against the "prisons" that keep women trapped is larger than the vote, and how such struggles will transform social life within modernity (<i>MW,</i> 93).

<p>
Nonetheless, a glance at her introduction alone offers some sense of Farr's particular politics. It is spoken from a patrician, aristocratic, explicitly "white" feminism, and tied to the medieval courtliness of white men, who have had their historical day in the sun as knights and troubadours. They are imagined by her as ting inspired by "their ladies' colours"&#8212;as if all of medieval life were a defense of Western women or done in their name&#8212;a peculiar position at best (<i>MW,</i> 12). "White men have fought in the past [against what it is not said, although to honor women is strongly implied], and it remains for white women to t now, and at last rid their sex all over the world of the ignominy of this false doctrine" (ibid). This "false doctrine" refers to Semitic patriarchal institutions, since the enemy of women's freedom is the "Semites" (Jews and "Mohammedans"&#8212;i.e. Muslims), whose patriarchal control of women was inexplicably reexpressed in Christianity. Farr claims that the world-historical problem at the root of women's oppression is that "the white races adopted the Assyrian Semite's Scriptures" (<i>MW,</i> 8). This snarl of scapegoating, Semiticized representations, patrician racism, and feminism is worth more than the cursory glance I give it here, but her general position is clear. Feminism offers a powerful "alchemy" to ignite the modern world, transmuting its institutions and revaluing its values, but the world doesn't yet much credit this "fire that is to burn it" (<i>MW,</i> 7). If this book is any indication, at age fifty, Farr's outspoken, intellectually wayward fire was rather undimmed.

<p>
Pound's poem shows a fascinated ambivalence toward the creative power and political bite of Farr, both as a New Woman, and as a serious, respected contributor to a Yeats-centered poetry scene, and, before that, to a Shaw and Ibsen-centered theater scene that was generally encoded as "feminist." The real re has been transformed from a critical, powerful, influential, outspoken, and original historical woman into a textual "femme"&#8212;one form of a muse of modernism&#8212;an inadequate, anonymous, and displaceable female re. Hardly static or a dilettante, though a woman of many interests, Florence Farr&#8212;artist, actress, thinker, and performer&#8212;has been rather startlingly recast by Pound. His poem portrays Farr as empty and "second always," instead of a formidable cultural activist, her fervent female striving interpreted as a seaweedy trap or "slow float," and her energetic social criticism a useless backwater.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 All in all, Pound's poem is a mechanism in the service of one kind of male subjectivity&#8212;the active creation of a shallow but provocative female muse for the containment of historical New Woman effervescence and achievement. This is an important move in the relationship of modernism to modernity. By representing a female re in this way, Pound has contained, grounded, or stalled consideration of the impact-laden presence and agency of the "real person" on whom the poem was based, making the re an 
<b></b>
Old Woman with useful muse properties, an exemplum of old stuff that still somehow inspires. Poetic representation masters this female re, using poetic institutions like "muse" in order to deflect attention away from the historical achievements of Farr, the hidden subject.

<p>
What else could be at stake here? To answer, I must assume that the "over-elaborate post-Browning "'Imagiste' affair"&#8212;a poem that Pound sent to Harriet Monroe in August 1912&#8212;is this same "Portrait d'une Femme."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 If this phrase does describe "Portrait d'une Femme," it marks a curious conflicting transition in his poetry&#8212;for how could something be at once "over-elaborate" and "Imagiste'" given those "few rules" of imagism, a movement invented circa December 1912 and elaborated in those well-known dicta early in 1913? "Portrait d'une Femme" is arguably the precise opposite of imagist work: it is an <i>indirect</i> treatment of "the thing," saturated with adjective and repetition far beyond condensed efficiencies of "the presentation," and composed not in forward-looking, musical free verse, but using a pentameter "metronome."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 Given this symptomatic conflict between statement and poem, what else is at stake? The pressure from futurist polemicist Filippo Marinetti.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 His work was available in London from 1910, when he presented his ideas at the Lyceum Club and in 1912, when a March lecture on futurism was given the same day that Pound delivered his second lecture on the troubadours, concerning Arnault Daniel.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 In a "careerist" reading, Litz and Lawrence Rainey propose that the enormous 1912 success of Marinetti's avant-garde proposals and affronts, in contrast to Pound's work in "literary culture" as "a restricted aristocracy of sensibility," directly motivated imagism's invention.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 To make his cultural mark, they argue, Pound felt he had to construct some distinctive, audacious product, and not simply that which embodied and represented the cultural heritage of the past. The poem expresses this debate.

<p>
The "femme" is surrounded in her pool of debris with all the cultural materials that kept Pound from being perfectly modern in the audacious Marinetti sense: a lack of an "aggressive character," an attachment to beauty, a "pensive immobility," and stasis (rather than "speed"). A whole past of beautiful but waterlogged cultural goods swirls around this re&#8212;goods by which Pound was insistently and overwhelmingly tempted, but that were ultimately cast away in millennial futurist provocations: "we will destroy the museums, libraries. . . . will t moralism, feminism . . ."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 To rid himself of the "museum"-quality goods that make culture soggy, Pound attributes them to the "femme," finds them damaged although tempting, and then wards them off in the "No!" and "Nothing." To possess these materials is to be swamped by culture as it was, to be able to have nothing that's "quite your own." The double move of identification with the materials and rejection of them is contradictory, of course; this contradiction is a coiled spring giving the poem power. No matter that Farr's own personal culture (as a real individual) may have been as modern (in her feminism) as it was retro (in her medievalism). This was exactly the kind of synthesis Pound used to desire, but now had to reject in order to position himself as adequately, truly modern from not quite modern enough.



<b></b>

<p>
Thus the poem is described proleptically as "post-Browning" although it is not at all beyond Browning&#8212;it is Browningesque, imitated after Browning, and "post-" only in that sense. The poem is described as "Imagiste" although it is not imagiste at all; it is rather rhetorically "over-elaborate." Hence this lack of fit between his description and his poem is itself precise evidence of the tension between Pound's "Victorian modernism" and his desires for a diction-cleansing, culture-purging rupture in some emphatic mode.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The inaccurate description both exposes his inadequate modernism and is an act of dislodging to rectify that inadequacy. To acknowledge the old muse, to establish his career power, to scapegoat her materials even as he is tempted, to cast her off in the last lines as unoriginal&#8212;these are vital accomplishments.

<p>
Furthermore, if it is possible&#8212;and it is not unlikely&#8212;that in hearing Marinetti's ideas, Pound might have caught wind of the "disprezzo della donna," this program might have focused his attitude toward his "femme." The part of Marinetti's program called "scorn for woman" is an "ideological double helix," in Janet Lyon's words (<i>M,</i> 101). If Marinetti meant "scorn" for the bourgeois, romantic ideology of Womanhood with all the conservative, madonna-esque or feminine manipulations that implies, his phrase could betoken feminist critique of the gender system. If he meant scorn for women as actual people standing in the way of the sleek automotive purgations by violence that his manifesto enacted, or scorn for the effeminate in men, then such scorn had ideological implications in the building of muscular modernist claims by strategic attacks on specific women, on women's activism, and on transgressive gender ideas. This poem, arguably registering Marinetti's interventions, although hardly as slashing, over-stated, or absolute as Marinetti's claims, could be described as Pound's soft-core scorn. In "Portrait d'une Femme," Pound makes the past (his past) pass&eacute;iste by putting it into a female site of entrapment, revealing the enormous temptation of this site, and finally by rejecting that past.

<p>
Pound's particular modernism, soon to be under war pressure, as well as being already under New Woman pressure and pressure from alternative, transgressive sexualities, is gradually coming to be parallel with non-effeminate maleness. Despite the enormous contemporaneous critical thinking on this issue, one kind of masculine sensibility&#8212;"the real sperm of them"&#8212;triumphs within his thinking. Propounding this maleness is part of Pound's notable achievement during this period; it is probably one of his most culturally influential acts within the reception of modernism as well as its production.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 One part of Pound's constructed maleness is sustained, though not without unevenness, by various short and long-term strategies working against the acknowledgment of women as coequal and co-temporal producers of artistic and critical works; yet he evinces a good deal of conflict in relation to any specific woman. As we have seen at length, in this poem the trace of the female re as coequal and co-temporal is reduced, which is rather startling when the nature and opinions of the "real woman," Florence Farr, are considered.

<p>
The poem is the mechanism for the imaginative, and possibly real, consolidation of a male poetic subjectivity as modern by the mellow, "reluctant" disparaging of a female cultural producer, whom Pound perceives as a rival and as a backwater, in two 
<b></b>
different, conflicting narratives involved with fellow male artists: the "Yeats" (and "Shaw") narrative, and the "Marinetti" narrative. Making a historical woman coequal into a poetic muse thins her, controls her agency and impact, evokes the past of poetry as an institution around her, voids her critical Ibsen-inspired interventions into issues of gender, avoids her accomplishments as a performer and musician, and reduces her own modernity to a retro backwater. Indeed, as a cultural institution of poetry used by a modernist, the muse is a mechanism that takes a modern subject&#8212;a New Woman&#8212;and changes her into an encumbered, static, non-modern subject. The poem moves Farr backward, setting her "scores" of years behind her own historical time and achievements, creating female belatedness from a woman pioneer in order to consolidate a male pioneer from a man's sense of his own belatedness. The resistance to acknowledging females as modern subjects (a denial of historicity noted by Rita Felski) may be said to begin in Anglo-American modernism with poems such as this one.

<p>
Pound wittily and carefully uses the poetic conventions of the lyric&#8212;the muse re inside the apparatus of poesis&#8212;to construct a passive retro muse, a female re from an active, provocative influence in historical time. Pound uses poetic convention to protect himself from historical shifts around gender. One can see that his poetic career is forged from intricate cross-and intra-gendered power interactions that include among them friendship, mentoring, misogyny, sex-radical thinking, male potency, sexual hopes and fantasies, and male panic, all of which play against and are inflected by poetic subject positions such as muse. The ultimate purpose of a feminist and historical examination of poetic texts is to change the terms and understandings of poetry definitively, placing issues of gender, the apparatus of poesis, and power-oriented production and reception centrally in play. Asking gendered questions of the ideologies and social situations of poetry as a mode of practice constitutes an opening into the deepest apparatus of poesis.

One can hardly avoid seeing this poem as similar to T. S. Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," which expresses the speaker's desire to separate from a maternal and genteel re of entrapment and apparently amateur status. However, it is unlikely that Pound knew of this Eliot poem when he wrote his; in 1912 the Eliot poem existed only in manuscript. The two poets did not meet until 1914. Marianne Moore's 1917 "Monkeys"&#8212;with its puma or lynx speaking bitterly about animal-human power relations (possibly a gender allegory), and its ending about the sea's shocking deposits of debris&#8212;seems to be an oblique commentary upon Pound's "Portrait d'une Femme."

Similarly, a provoking split in memories of Farr between her pre-Raphaelite look and her professional activities as capable performer and organizer is articulated in Yeats's final summary, which places Farr in a particular psycho-spiritual grouping in <i>A Vision</i> : "A certain actress [Farr] is typical [of Phase 19], for she surrounds herself with drawings by Burne-Jones in his latest period, and reveres them as they were holy pictures, while her manners are boisterous, dominating, and egotistical. They are faces of silent women, and she is not silent for a moment . . ." W. B. Yeats, <i>A Vision</i> (1938; New York: Macmillan, 1961), 150. The New Woman subjectivity is disparaged in these remarks and viewed as a deception. The consensus is: better silent pre-Raphaelite women than demanding modern ones who have opinions and claims. In the case of Yeats, this judgment is the more striking given Cassandra Laity's argument in her unpublished dissertation that Yeats was indebted to the New Woman in general, and to Farr in particular, in his changed depictions of warrior queens in his drama: decisive, masculine, female res of agency and force. Cassandra Laity, "From Fatal Woman to New Woman: Yeats's Changing Image of Woman in his Art and Aesthetics" (Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, 1985).

This novel appeared in the same year in which Farr departed for Sri Lanka (in August) and Pound wrote his poem. Florence Farr [Emery], <i>The Solemnization of Jacklin: Some Adventures on the Search for Reality</i> (London: A. C. Fifield, 1912); hereafter abbreviated <i>SJ.</i> Dorothy wrote to Ezra, "Just read a new book by 'Florence Farr.' Such a Sargasso Sea muddle. Every body divorced several times, &amp; in the end going back to their originals: &amp; a young man called 'Dorus Callando' who lay among lilies all night &amp; is Oscar [Wilde] without the bitter-sweetness." O. Pound and Litz, eds., <i>Ezra Pound,</i> 132.

Long after this polemical analysis had been written, I found the following in a fascinating study by Kumari Jayawardena, who sketches incisive analytic pictures of European, mainly British, women who contributed in a variety of ways to South Asian life, whether as reformers, educators, or spiritual seekers. She observes that "while Pound is somewhat dismissive of Florence Farr for her dilettantism, not surprisingly, he fails to note or value her feminism, her challenge to patriarchal attitudes and her approach to education." Jayawardena's chapter is mainly devoted to Farr's end-of-career commitment to education for Hindu girls in Sri Lanka; Farr served as principal of a Ramanathan College in Jaffna for several years until just before her death in 1917, a role that became increasingly unsatisfying as her guru turned out to have rather retrograde ideas about the education of girls into wives and mothers. Jayawardena depicts Farr as "misrepresented" by the various men in her life, and uses <i>Modern Woman</i> briefly to trace Farr's feminist politics, although the book's racial politics are not mentioned.

On aspects of Marinetti's program, see Marjorie Perloff, <i>The Futurist Moment: Avant-Garde, Avant Guerre, and the Language of Rupture</i> (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1986), 86-92; for gender interpretations of that program, see Peter Nicholls, <i>Modernisms: A Literary Guide,</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 84-92; Carolyn Burke, <i>Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy</i> (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996), 156-7; and Janet Lyon, <i>Manifestoes: Provo</i>cations of the Modern (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1999), 92-123; hereafter abbreviated <i>M.</i>

Modernism and the New Criticism,</i> ed. A. Walton Litz, Louis Menand, and Lawrence Rainey (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 57-92, especially 68-70. I am extending their argument here to apply to "Portrait d'une Femme."
