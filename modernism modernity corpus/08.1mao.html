<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What was modernism's relation to the concept of culture? To those
of us who have spent some time with modernism, at least two kinds of
answer might suggest themselves right away. One would fix on modernism's
ambivalent entanglement with "high culture" at its demandingly highest,
and find its icons in writers like T. W. Adorno (railing against the
culture industry on behalf of a bleak and difficult art) or better still
T. S. Eliot (author not only of a poem whose forbidding learnedness helped
to secure its eminence but also, thirty years later, of <I>Notes</I>
reporting that evidence of cultural decline "is visible in every
department of human activity").
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The other sort of answer would play upon a rather different sense
 of "culture": here, res like the Picasso of <I>Les demoiselles
 d'Avignon</I> or the Conrad of <I>Heart of Darkness</I> would evoke
 modern Western art's fascination with non- Western people, objects, and
 texts, and more generally the essential "modernism" of cross-cultural
 contact on an unprecedented scale. The high-culture response and the
 other-culture response both attest to the intimacy of modernism and
 "culture," of course; but contemplated together they also appear as poles
 of a contradiction that can seem--to anyone worn out by the "culture
 wars" of the 1990s, and quite apart from questions about modernism
 per se--more bothersome than generative. The prescriptive sense of the
 oh-so-tired term bids it be esteemed right into impossibility ("culture,"
 since Matthew Arnold, as the perfection of knowledge and manners that
 no one can quite achieve); the descriptive one looks ample to the point
 of meaninglessness ("culture" as a totality hard to differentiate from
 society itself). Why mess with it anymore?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her savvy and important new book, <I>Patterns for America: Modernism
and the Concept of Culture,</I> Susan Hegeman faces squarely the

<B></B>

irritation that "culture" currently produces, arguing both that the
slipperiness of the term is a reason to prize rather than dismiss it, and
that attempts to negotiate between the aforementioned (and still other)
meanings proved crucial to the shaping of a modernism whose consequences
continue to be felt. According to her, "the lineaments of many of the
most visible contemporary debates about 'culture' are residua of the
early Cold War era," and the origins of Cold War formulations themselves
to be discerned in confrontations transpiring in the preceding decades
. It was during the heyday of modernism that those most concerned
with America's ills and possibilities came routinely to invoke "culture"
in their diagnoses; it was in the 1930s most acutely, as Warren Susman
has argued, that Americans came "to do two new things: to understand
themselves as participating in a distinctive 'American' culture, and
to see this culture as a set of patterns, values, and beliefs roughly
comparable to those of other cultures" . For her, in other words,
the roots of our own multicultural panics and pleasures lie in the
young century's effort to fulfill at a stroke culture's descriptive
and prescriptive mandates--to conceive of an American culture whose
virtues would be those of both an American <I>culture</I> (an achieved,
coherent culture where none had existed before) and an <I>American</I>
culture (not better than any other, but right for Americans where any
other would be wrong).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To represent Hegeman's book this way is to make it sound rather more
like <I>Our America</I> --Walter Benn Michaels's strenuously
provocative effort to intervene in the culture wars through a reading
of modernism--than it does in its own voice. Still, it's worth noting up
front that in spite of important disagreements (to be considered further
on), she shares his belief that the crucial link between modernism and the
concept of culture lies in a set of interlocked anxieties about identity
and relativism. For her, then, the new understanding described by Susman
is rendered "complexly modernist" not only by its siting in the first
half of the twentieth century, but also by the "estranged perception of
collective identity" that it enables, its allusion to "the construction
of group identities of a decidedly uneasy and reflexive kind" . Like
Michaels, Hegeman is interested in how unease and reflexivity play around
res such as the immigrant and the Indian (Do they represent an alien
culture, or the most authentically American culture?), and like him,
she finds Americanness at issue in virtually all treatments of culture by
American writers of the period. But where his main project is to disclose
logics of culture and identity as these materialize in prose fiction,
she asks, in addition, where the double sense of "culture" came from,
and how it migrated to the realm of literature, high and low.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Her answer is that one origin, at least, lay in what was coalescing, in
the early years of the century, as an academic discipline with its own
anxieties and enthusiasms. Early in <I>Patterns for America,</I> Hegeman
describes as "typically modernist" a certain oft-told tale in which the
"'Arnoldian' view of culture as the attainment of social and aesthetic
perfection" is "swept away" by "what is often called the 'anthropological'
definition of the term, which is more synonymous with custom, connoting
both the special and the mundane life ways of a given group of people"
. The heroes of this "modernist" story aren't poets, novel-writers,
or artists, however, nor is the scene of combat the Paris of Picasso or
the London of Arnold, Eliot, and Conrad. Rather, the leading personae
are the Columbia University anthropologist Franz Boas and his students;
the scene is New York City; and the tale is, precisely, that of how
comparative ethnography propelled a rethinking of culture and value that
retains its hold on us today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman isn't greatly concerned to disburden this story of its heroism,
but she does revisit it with an impressive array of reconsiderations
and nuances, foremost among them the point that in implicitly opposing
(new, good, democratic) ethnography to (old, Arnoldian, hierarchical)
literary cultivation, the received story obscures important connections
between the Columbia anthropologists and a number of influential literati
centered in Greenwich Village during the same years. These connections
form the heart of <I>Patterns for America,</I> which--as much intellectual
group biography as it is a reading of culture and modernism--might with
no loss of aptness have been called <I>Anthropologists and Bohemians in
New York, 1918 to 1960,</I> or <I>Greenwich</I> 

<B></B>

<I>Village to Morningside Heights: An Interdisciplinary Legacy.</I>
Yet there's nothing misleading about the title the book does have,
for Hegeman shows convincingly how sympathies and disagreements within
her loose New York constellation set the terms for much larger debates
about the forms of American culture--and in so doing manages nimbly
the feat (precious to post-Geertzian anthropology and new historicist
literary analysis alike) of drawing broadly consequential inferences
from elaborations of specific milieux.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Initially, Hegeman's favored procedure is to pair anthropologists with
intellectuals-at-large, in each instance strengthening the case for
metaphorical alignment (the two res had similar backgrounds and
ideas) with an appeal to metonymy (the two res were linked by the
Columbia-Village nexus). In chapter two, for example, she notes in
passing that Randolph Bourne was a student of Boas's colleague John
Dewey, while considering in some detail how opposition to American
intervention in World War One led both Boas and Bourne to their most
important contributions to the evolving discourse of culture. (For both,
American intolerance of German difference made imperative the defense,
if not the articulation, of a relativist cultural pluralism.) In three,
she shows how the problem of individual agency within cultural production
led both Van Wyck Brooks and Edward Sapir--who shared "the same general
social milieu as Boas and Bourne"--to powerful doubts about the very
possibility of an authentically valid American culture . And in four,
she argues that Ruth Benedict and Waldo Frank are worth reading together
not only because of Frank's journalistic connections to Benedict's friend
and mentor Sapir, but also because both turned to a "loose federalism" of
regional cultures "geographically remote from urban America" for help in
resolving the impasses that defeated Sapir and Brooks . Illuminating
as this kind of pairing may be, however, it can stand only so much
interpretive pressure before it becomes rigid, and Hegeman is alert to
that danger. Accordingly, she enriches the Boas-Bourne material with a
fresh take on Eliot, the Brooks-Sapir with a look at Alfred Kroeber's
notion of "the superorganic," the Benedict-Frank with readings of Jean
Toomer and Sherwood Anderson. She abandons the dyadic approach wholly
when it ceases to serve, putting Constance Rourke, Kenneth Burke,
Robert and Helen Lynd, Thomas Hart Benton, Nathanael West, and others
in suggestive array in chapter five, and visiting Benedict, Brooks,
Margaret Mead, Dwight Macdonald and James Agee in six.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One advantage of the New York focus is that it enables Hegeman to
avoid, very cleanly, one of the traps into which certain historicists
(Michaels especially) have been known to fall: that of making appeals to
zeitgeist or epistemic rupture unsupported by attention to the paths by
which ideas are transmitted and the conditions under which ideological
positions mature. It's not that she regards personal contact or shared
environments as the necessary foundation of comparison, as if absorption
of topics <I>en l'air</I> and undocumented acts of reading and listening
aren't the powerful forces they always are; on the contrary, her focal
pairs tend to be more distantly connected than other couples that she
might have treated at length. (Benedict and Frank, for example, shared
nothing like the bonds that linked Benedict to Mead and Sapir.) In its
particular way of attending to the Village-Columbia nexus, however,
her work answers a demand made by Raymond Williams--but forgotten by
some of Williams's less careful admirers--that individuals' experiences,
and particularly their experiences of large social forces, be considered
as factors in the generation of ideas. True, there are moments when
she turns inopportunely from intriguing conceptual problems to blander
biographical rationales. When she describes Brooks's tendency to resort
to binaries as "a fascinating example of a repetition compulsion," or
when (on slender evidence) she traces writers' worries about cultural
community to disappointment with the New York scene itself, I hear
the note of explanation-through-trauma that is one of contemporary
biography's least fortunate tendencies (74, 59, 91, 98). But such
moments are rare. More typical is her superb elucidation of how the
professionalizing of anthropology and literary criticism affected her
subjects' address to national culture, or her canny reading of Agee's
recourse to personal recollection in <I>Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men</I>--a fitting culmination to her exploration

<B></B>

of middle-class guilt's refraction through non-middle-class others in
writing of the Cold War and before.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another reason why biographical sympathies serve <I>Patterns for
America</I> so well is that they resonate with a theme that preoccupies
Hegeman's subjects: How is individual freedom to be reconciled with the
demand of social cohesion? This is, of course, the governing dilemma
of liberalism, and as she notes it has shadowed cultural prescription
at least since Arnold's recommendation that citizens transcend their
"ordinary selves" in favor of "best selves" joined by a cultural glue. Her
early chapters show illuminatingly how U.S. writers, confronting both the
contradictions of Arnold's "cheery mysticism" and the new world's apparent
poverty of tradition, sought to reframe the problem in distinctively
American terms . Brooks, for example, tried to imagine a fusion of
the spiritual yet desiccated "Puritan" element with that of the practical
but unprincipled "Pioneer," yet found in the very intransigence of this
binary (and its subsequent incarnations) a split within the middle-class
self that culture could never heal. Sapir, in Hegeman's account, came
to a similarly unhappy conclusion when he tried to apply his definition
of culture as the embodiment of "the national genius" to the case of the
United States . And in a provocative reading of Benedict's <I>Patterns
of Culture</I> <I>,</I> she argues that the anthropologist's much
discussed contrast between the "Apollonian" Zuni of New Mexico and the
"Dionysian" Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island may have less to do with the
difference between sobriety and ecstasy than with the tension between
communal and individual that subtended less veiled period imaginings of
the American utopia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benedict is the hinge of Hegeman's narrative, as her title might suggest,
because her thinking touches, on one side, intellectuals bounded by a
more or less Brooksian staging of the problem, and, on the other, a set
of mostly younger writers who turned to regionalism for relief from the
Arnoldian malady. This second group tried to reconcile diversity with
national genius by imagining a country of multiple coherent cultures among
which one, some, or none might be privileged as the genuine American
article; and it's when she turns to these formulations that she really
hits her stride. If the first part of <I>Patterns for America</I> is
often insightful, the second is frequently brilliant. Here, a sensitive
explication of Sherwood Anderson's <I>Poor White</I> illustrates how a
sentimentalized Midwest came to contain America's diversity in the double
sense of including it and expunging it; here, an analysis of restless
hands in Anderson and Nathanael West illustrates how "Anderson, once
held as the exemplar of a new, indigenous American modernist aesthetic,
becomes the source of a grotesque representation of the frustrated desires
of the middlebrow" (124, 156). Fine as these close readings are, however,
the greater strength of this part of the book lies in its ambitious
reconstruction of regionalism's role in the culture wars of the interwar
years. Working up from instances like Thomas Hart Benton's 1935 response
to Diego Rivera (in which Benton replaces Marxism's proletarian version of
"the people" with a middle-class and implicitly Midwestern "common man"
[142]), she presents an economical, yet extraordinarily powerful, overview
of how visions of difference based on region clashed with visions based on
class throughout the thirties. Nor is she less suggestive when she winds
up the thread of high regionalism's fate. Could the "deep anxiety about
cultural loss" felt by forties and fifties intellectuals, she wonders,
derive from a kind of spectacular demise of region itself? Might "the
increasing globalization of 'American culture'" not have "suggested
the increasing difficulty of locating a position for the intellectual
to inhabit that was critically exterior to the (global) social whole"
(170-1)?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be that no critical work ever fails to enact one or two of the
problems it describes, and <I>Patterns for America</I> does leave one
asking how closely its New York particular represented the American
general. The jacket copy promises a tracking of how "the term 'culture'
changed from being a technical term associated primarily with anthropology
into a term of popular usage," and this promise is handsomely fulfilled
in several ways. Hegeman shows concretely how the New York groups
disseminated their ideas through anthropological best-sellers, small
but influential

<B></B>

magazines, government-university partnerships, and other channels; she
also usefully spotlights some anti-New York, antihighbrow reactions,
notably <I>Time</I> magazine's promotion of Benton and Anderson as
regionalists defending sane middle-American representationalism from,
respectively, French abstraction and the literary "vagaries of the
Da-da school" . Still, I felt a twinge of doubt on encountering
the implication that a "widespread consensus over 'culture'" in the
thirties enveloped not only "writers, photographers, social crusaders,
[and] bureaucrats" but also many an average Joe and Jane, and found myself
wondering how culture was actually regarded by more pedestrian residents
of places that the New York groups made iconic of regionalism. What
were inhabitants of the real New Mexico, the real Ohio, the real Los
Angeles thinking ? And what was on the mind of Chicago, a place
that Hegeman shows to have been on New Yorkers' minds to a surprising
degree? How did Harriet Monroe--hardly an ordinary citizen, certainly,
but a Chicagoan in spite of her international connections--feel about
culture, regionalism, and identity?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The foregoing isn't a substantial complaint, only a question, and
I doubt that many readers will fault Hegeman for failing to cover
every last take on culture from the First World War to the Cold. The
name of Monroe, however, points to what some will find a more serious
absence following from the New York focus, that of extended attention
to the expatriate writing still regarded by many as the centerpiece of
American modernism. Except for Eliot (about whom more in moment), the
expates receive only passing mention here--references to Pound, Stein,
and H.D. are few--and even stay-at-home biggies like Stevens, Faulkner,
and Moore scarcely surface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 To this objection, Hegeman responds by stating plainly that modernism
 is for her "first and foremost a periodizing concept, characterized
 by a nexus of related historical, intellectual, technological, and
 aesthetic developments, rather than . . . a set of formal traits or
 styles," and by arguing that to hand modernism over wholly to "the
 cosmopolitan avant-gardes of a few European capitals" is to adopt a view
 that is "impoverished in its explanatory power" and is more rather than
 less open to charges of provincialism (19-21). She then offers a
 pr&eacute;cis of recent work on modernism as a historical phenomenon
 so crisply compact that one might recommend it as a primer for readers
 outside the field--just as one might hand <I>Patterns for America</I>
 as a whole to non-anthropologists interested in learning something
 about that discipline's history. Of course, none of this will satisfy
 those for whom modernism <I>is</I> a set of formal traits or styles,
 let alone those who take it to mean a specific canon of authors or
 works. (Even these, however, might grant Hegeman's claim to the extent
 that earlier chapters set the stage for her climactic reading of Cold
 War fabricators of modernism like Macdonald and Clement Greenberg.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For my money, the muting of expatriate modernism per se offers less
occasion for regret than does another omission, that of transatlantic
contexts for the American debates Hegeman examines. The book's opening
discussion of how "culture" sometimes overlaps with and sometimes opposes
"civilization" in writers like Bourne, Sapir, and Lewis Mumford is
useful, but it would have been more helpful still if it had engaged more
directly with Raymond Williams's work on the tension between these terms
in nineteenth-century British discourse, or Norbert Elias's rendering of
its inauguration under German Romanticism. (These genealogies would be
significant in any case, but they're all the more resonant here because,
like Hegeman, both Elias and Williams take very seriously the question
of historical actors' experience of social pressures.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 As just noted, also, the only American expatriate who receives
 substantial consideration is T. S. Eliot, but the treatment here fails
 to engage his most relevant polemic, <I>Notes towards the Definition
 of Culture</I> . Her early reading of "The Dry Salvages" 
 in relation to developments in anthropology is stimulating, as is her
 note on the spatialization of culture discernible in <I>After Strange
 Gods</I> . After this point, however, Eliot all but disappears
 from the radar, which is odd because <I>Notes</I> makes so many of the
 pluralist moves that Hegeman explores in other writers. True, Eliot's
 concern isn't the United States but the United Kingdom (which in his
 view should remain politically single but culturally multiple: English,
 Welsh, Scottish, Irish);

<B></B>

true also, the texts that she finds most salient in regionalism appeared
well before 1949. Yet 1949 isn't beyond the temporal scope of <I>Patterns
for America</I> as a whole, and it would surely have been illuminating
to put Eliot's later cultural federalism into dialogue with the turn
taken by postwar American critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And speaking of postwar American critics: If the light treatment given
Eliot's <I>Notes</I> is a little curious, downright strange is the absence
of explicit reference to Lionel Trilling's <I>Beyond Culture</I> ,
which speaks to Hegeman's concerns more immediately than any other product
of the <I>Partisan Review</I> milieu. In his preface to that collection,
Trilling not only worries about how far New York (and especially
Columbia) intellectuals may presume to speak for a larger society,
but also addresses this problem by way of the two meanings of "culture"
to which Hegeman recurs (in his rendering: "that complex of activities
which includes the practice of the arts and of certain intellectual
disciplines," and "a people's technology, its manners and customs,
its religious beliefs and organization, its systems of valuation").
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Moreover, the governing supposition of <I>Beyond Culture</I> is that
 "a primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual
 from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit
 him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In other words, Trilling here (as in other books like <I>The Liberal
 Imagination</I>) confronts both the problem of individual agency
 within culture <I>and</I> a problem of epistemological totality that,
 as we'll see in a moment, surfaces in the last pages of <I>Patterns
 for America.</I> Might it be that at some stage in the preparation of
 Hegeman's book, Trilling was its explicitly presiding genius? As things
 stand, he remains its (almost) silently presiding ghost.

II.
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One omission with which Hegeman can't be charged is a failure to
address contemporary battles over "culture." In her last chapter,
she applies her insights into the term's genealogy to the question of
its place and usage in the United States today, which is to say that
<I>Patterns for America,</I> again like Michaels's <I>Our America,</I>
is a reading of modernism and culture that has something significant to
say to readers with no interest in modernism as such. Confronted with an
infinite number of possible approaches to the question, Hegeman elects to
examine "arguments that have been made recently by both anthropologists
and literary scholars for the complete abandonment of 'culture' as a
critical term"--arguments that she would not represent as a "dominant,
or even an emergent, view among people invested in . . . things widely
thought of as 'cultural'"  but that do give some purchase on
inclinations and agendas underlying a range of debates on culture today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman's first test case is the anthropologist Virginia R. Dominguez's
assertion that because the term "culture" has its roots in a Eurocentric
elitism, its deployment in anthropology will always be tainted by
Eurocentrism and other hegemonic impositions of hierarchy. For Dominguez,
in other words, the "anthropological," horizontalizing sense of culture
hasn't canceled out, and never can cancel out, the "Arnoldian," vertical
vision that it complicated and partially displaced. She addresses this
line of argument--and a related one advanced by Johannes Fabian--briskly,
asking on what grounds deletion of the term from (anthropological)
use should be preferred to a retention that maintains an awareness of
the term's complex history. "[U]nless we are to assume that 'culture'
is somehow unique among words," she writes, "Fabian and Dominguez
are . . . offering a theory of language . . . in which terms somehow
inherently contain, or import, specific ideas, largely irrespective of
context and usage" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 She then turns to a similar recommendation issuing from a nearly opposite
 critical position, and dispatches it with similar efficiency. To Joel
 S. Kahn's claim that "culture" is rendered all but meaningless by
 the <I>distance</I> of the presiding anthropological sense from the
 Arnoldian origin, and his consequent

<B></B>

worry that abuse of "culture" perpetuates an impossible fantasy of
"escaping our own concepts and categories into a world of the other"
(202; Kahn's phrasing), Hegeman replies that informed retention of a term
that insistently recalls the anthropologist's "reflexive dilemma" will
likely be more productive for the field than attempts to end ambivalence
via dictional purgation (202-3).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman's final engagement is more extended and more complicated:
the opponent this time is Michaels himself, and the texts at issue,
<I>Our America</I> and an earlier distillation of its argument,
"Race into Culture: A Critical Genealogy of Cultural Identity." In
Hegeman's reading, Michaels aligns with Dominguez, Fabian, and Kahn in
advocating the eschewing of "culture," and speaks to Kahn especially
closely because the ground of this recommendation lies in a critique of
"race." Both Kahn and Michaels regard racial essentialism as at once
ontologically indefensible and political pernicious, and both link the
reification of race to that of culture. Whereas Kahn sees the two terms
as operating analogously ("the notion of <I>a</I> culture is formally
identical [to that of <I>a</I> race]" [203]), however, Michaels discerns
a tighter bond. For him, the "modern concept of culture is not . . . a
critique of racism; it is a form of racism," because exhortations to
maintain cultural integrity must of necessity be grounded in an appeal
to something outside the complex of beliefs and practices that constitute
a culture--and that something must be, or at least has been, race.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One curiosity of Hegeman's argument with Michaels is that it doesn't
unfold on the ground of the American modernism that is the common interest
of <I>Patterns for America</I> and <I>Our America</I>; nor does it dwell
heavily (though it does dwell some) on present-day popular understandings
of "culture" that Michaels strikingly ignores. In keeping with her
decision to approach matters via debates in anthropology, Hegeman instead
seeks to show how he gets caught up in a version of the reflexive dilemma:
chez Michaels, she asserts, "we cannot get outside of our culture any more
than we can our beliefs, because like our beliefs, our culture constrains
what can be thought--including what can be thought about 'culture'" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Under this view, Michaels joins other advocates of the jettisoning of
 "culture" who find the term so enveloping that it becomes meaningless,
 so total that it becomes "impotently descriptive" (Michaels's phrasing)
 rather than, presumably, potently prescriptive. To this, Hegeman rightly
 responds that impotence and description need not go together: "Giving
 descriptive content to 'what we do and believe' . . . would do the
 significant, and likely very controversial work of (among other things)
 defining the contours of a bounded population, of marking the difference
 between 'we' and 'they'" . The stage is then set for her closing
 recommendation, which is that the term "culture" be retained precisely
 because it tends to foreground messy exceptions to its own delimitations,
 and in so doing proves highly serviceable to attempts--utterly crucial
 "in this postmodern moment of destabilized totalities"--to mediate
 between "the local instance" and "the conceptual whole" (211-12).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This seems to me a profitable and (once again) sensible suggestion; what
I question, however, is whether Michaels quite says everything Hegeman
says he says. It seems to me worth taking time to consider further one
or two of his arguments, not because <I>Patterns for America</I> is to
be seen as laboring in the shadow of <I>Our America</I> (Hegeman's book
is significant enough to cast some shadows of its own), but because doing
so will give us added purchase on some of her conclusions--and, I think,
on the more general question of what relationships among modernism,
our own moment, and "culture" finally pertain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For starters, we might notice that in <I>Our America,</I> if not in
"Race into Culture," Michaels is bothered less by culture as such than
he is by cultural pluralism--or "cultural pluralism," which, he insists,
is an oxymoron. Why? Because

on the one hand, the pluralist claim that our practices are justified
only because they are better for us requires us to be able to say who
we are independent of those practices and so requires us to produce our
racial identity. But, on the other hand, the cultural claim denies the
relevance of race and so leaves us unable to appeal to facts about who
we are as justifications for what we do. . . . Cultural pluralism is
thus committed in principle to

<B></B>

identity essentialism, which is to say that in cultural pluralism,
culture does not constitute identity, it reflects or, more precisely,
expresses it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This claim may sound strange extracted here, but it sounds less so
when read as a summary of positions elsewhere developed a little more
patiently. Phrased more simply, the claim is that cultural pluralists
believe in the preservation of multiple cultures on the ground that those
cultures belong to or with certain people, quite apart from any other
value they may have; this is in contrast to the view that some cultures or
races are worth defending because they're better than others, or even good
where others are bad (as in turn-of-the-century white supremacism, which
he contrasts to the nativist pluralism of 1920s American writing). While
cultural pluralism may be less <I>recognizably</I> racist than this other
view, it's not (according to Michaels) actually less so. Each is premised
on a reification and indeed a validation of race as the basis of praxis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There's a certain logical rigor in Michaels's argument, undoubtedly, and
if we keep that argument in mind we'll be sure to recognize as racist
the insistence that each person must practice--or as we might say more
fashionably, "perform"--"her" culture and no other because it's "hers"
according to ancestry or biology. Yet how many "pluralists" in this
country today actually hold such a view? Certainly, many people believe
something of the kind casually much of the time, perhaps less casually
at times when their own children's or neighbors' ways of living are
at issue. Certainly, too, there are self-proclaimed racists who would
readily endorse such a view of cultural obligation, though they might
also acknowledge that the cool dictates of culture finally have nothing,
for them, on the warm satisfactions of blood. And certainly, again,
there are those--Christopher Clausen in last year's <I>Faded Mosaic:
The Emergence of Post-Cultural America,</I> for example--who refashion
for postmodern times the lament of Bourne, Eliot, and others that true
cultural diversity has been one of modernity's victims, the old life
ways of distinctive ethnic groups having succumbed to homogenizing forces
like advertising and television.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Yet it's quite clear that the first two kinds of people are not well
 characterized as "pluralists." And it remains doubtful that the third,
 even if pluralist in Michaels's terms, would endorse the proposition that
 cultural diversity is to be preserved because people should practice
 what their identity bids them, rather than for the sake of continuity
 with the past or diversity pure and simple.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nor, it must be added, would any of these positions be identified with
the contemporary political left. This last point isn't pertinent to
the absolute logic of Michaels's argument, of course, but it's highly
relevant to the status of <I>Our America</I> as an intervention in
mid-1990s debates, because the book draws much of its air of controversy
from the impression that it aims to expose ugly truths about leftists,
not rightists. Actual left-based agendas pertaining to culture, however,
are rarely driven by a belief in the metaphysical truth of the proposition
that people ought to be true to what they ancestrally are (though, to
be fair, they're often supported by an assumption that people should
be <I>allowed</I> to be true to what they believe themselves to be,
and even--in some cases--that people have a right to possess what
they believe to have belonged to their ancestors). A more important
motivation for left cultural pluralism is a certain custodial impulse,
which may include a commitment to the preservation and dissemination
of historical knowledge as well as the kind of general anxiety about
things disappearing that impels some environmentalists; another motive
is the conviction (shared by conservatives like Clausen) that cultural
diversity is valuable simply because it contributes to life's plentitude.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There's also a more evidently political and progressive reason to affirm
"culture" as a sanction for certain ideas and practices, which is that
concretely injurious hostility to persons believed to belong to other
groups is frequently rooted in an antipathy to foreign behaviors, styles,
and beliefs--to elements, in other words, that we would unhesitatingly
call cultural. This position doesn't require a belief in the reality
of race, or even a belief that particular cultural forms need to be
attached to particular persons. What it does require is a belief that
xenophobia or hostility to difference has been harmful, and that it
can be countered in large or small ways by certain affirmations of,
or exposures to, practices that could otherwise seem threatening in their

<B></B>

strangeness. Michaels performs an inestimably valuable service in
reminding us that pluralist initiatives, including multicultural events
and curricula, may abet rather than diminish racism insofar as they
perpetuate the reification of race and the essentializing of identity. The
argument that such initiatives are themselves intrinsically racist,
however, is at once overingenious and misleading. It might hold true in
a world utterly free of the unreason of history, or rather free of the
persistence of unreason, but it's manifestly false in the world we have,
where "mistakes" (Michaels's word) like race continue to exert powerful
effects on people's lives.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some proponents of this line, certainly, might join with nostalgics like
Clausen to decry the degradation of the term "culture" implicit in the
foregoing account, especially as it touches on multiculturalism. If
the Left proposes a future in which we (where "we" might mean, say,
all Americans) come to think of ourselves as one rather than many,
but still occasionally trot out some old-country finery or traditional
"ethnic" dish by way of nodding to our then-divided ancestors, what
has happened to authentic culture? Is what's proffered here not rather
an Epcot Center gone global--all ersatz and toothless, and finally
not culture at all? Whether such forays (however fraudulent) wouldn't
count as elements in a new culture (however attractive or loathsome)
is, of course, an open question: the central claim of Clausen's book is
that such a condition can't count as culture, which is why the United
States in the year 2000 is already, in his calculatingly inflated phrase,
"post-cultural." But even if we were to agree that this is a fair picture
of multiculturalist aspirations <I>and</I> that it describes something
so inauthentic that it ceases to be culture, we might ask why anyone
advancing <I>Michaels</I>'s argument would care to stake so much on
authenticity. It would be strange, after all, to fault pluralists for
using culture to support their covertly racist attachment to purity
of identity only to fault them for inauthenticity if they respond,
"But culture doesn't have to be attached to identity so inflexibly." To
the degree that Michaels himself takes this line, then, he does finally
oppose "culture" as well as pluralism, for in such terms culture can
only serve racist ends or be inauthentic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of this should strike us as a problem not least because, as Hegeman
reminds us, there are many currently prevalent uses of "culture" that
attach to things other than race, including things utterly removed from
"identity" in any remotely encompassing sense. We have not only "gay
culture," which has been deeply and agonizingly bound up with identity
questions, but also "corporate culture," "the culture of death," and
locutions like "the culture of my high school," which by and large have
not. Michaels entirely refrains from discussing these deployments in
<I>Our America,</I> but what they name for contemporary Americans are
sets of beliefs and practices characteristic of groups that may not
always--and in some cases can absolutely never--subsume one wholly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Authenticity, here, is no longer tethered to essence; one may feel
 oneself truly a part of corporate culture without believing that one
 is eternally, absolutely, or even willingly corporate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be that adherents of Michaels's line would find these uses of
"culture" illegitimate; the interesting question is what could make them
so, apart from the pointlessly doctrinaire claim that culture must always
be racial culture. The interesting answer, surely, is that what makes them
seem inauthentic is their very rapprochement with partialness. From such
a perspective, what makes a "culture" of this sort not a real culture is
precisely its failure to meet one of the few criteria on which Arnold and
the anthropologists agreed: the criterion of totality, which requires
that a culture entail a whole way of being. Hegeman's observation that
Michaels "smuggles in" totality when querying culture is therefore
apposite, though the notion of totality that subtends his argument
may not be exactly the one that she discerns. When Michaels refers to
culture as "what we do and believe," he's not, as far as I can tell,
evoking the epistemological quandary of how one might get outside one's
given conceptual universe in order to talk about that universe. Rather,
he's referring to the whole set of beliefs and practices believed to
accompany a racial identity, where the presumption is that a person will
normally be limited to one identity only.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But fewer and fewer Americans, it seems, believe themselves wholly
embedded in a single identity or a single culture (apart from "American"
identity and culture), and almost none, probably, imagine all other
Americans to be so installed. Charles Altieri alludes to this aspect
of contemporary understandings in his contribution to a 1996 forum on
<I>Our America</I> in this journal, remarking that

How many Americans, conservative, moderate, or radical, would insist that
immersion in "corporate culture" utterly precludes involvement in, say,
"West Indian culture" or "lesbian culture"? A person might, after all,
be a West Indian in-house counsel who shares sex and domesticity with
another woman; a person might even try to participate in or partake
of one or more of these cultures <I>without</I> identifying herself
(or himself) as West Indian, corporate, or lesbian. Conservatives may
cringe, theorists of performance may rejoice, but the issue here is not
whether conceptions of "culture" unhinged from encompassing identity are
desirable or undesirable. The point is that such conceptions are in play
among contemporary Americans whether one likes it or not. Michaels is
certainly correct if he limits himself to the claim that many Americans
still do and believe certain things on the grounds that these things
belong to their "own" cultures. But he's clearly wrong to imply that
American attitudes toward cultural life, cultural diversity, and cultural
preservation remain circumscribed, or even dominated, by the belief that
one <I>must</I> immerse oneself in one's own culture and nobody else's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Hegeman suggests (but might to good effect have brought out more
strongly), then, the oscillation of "culture" between wholeness
and partialness in contemporary debates results not just from
disciplinary uncertainties or scholarly compunction, but from a change
in extra-academic understanding that may retain racism of various kinds,
but notably eases out the particular strain of racism that occupies
Michaels. One of the oddities, not to say ironies, of Michaels's book
is that it meticulously charts transformations in the story of "race"
and "culture" occurring between the 1890s and the 1920s, yet implies
that <I>since</I> the twenties nothing much has altered. In this
respect, as in a number of others, <I>Patterns for America</I> is the
far superior study of modernism and culture. For not only does Hegeman
extend her genealogy of "culture" farther into the century and attend to
present-day usages; she also takes care to think about the mechanisms
by which certain writers got their beliefs into wide circulation,
instead of tacitly mapping the agenda of a historically limited group
(early-century pluralists or "progressive racists") on to the whole
period of that group's flourishing <I>and</I> on to an ill-defined,
though implicitly vast, present-day American imaginary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But at least one more objection to the retention of "culture" remains. For
mightn't it be that the best argument for retiring "culture" lies,
precisely, in its recent appropriation by the partial? Couldn't it
be argued that, pace Hegeman's tribute to terms with vexed histories,
"culture" now promotes a peculiarly harmful confusion because it has
come to designate exactly that which both the anthropological and the
Arnoldian-Eliotic usages meant to exclude? Couldn't it be claimed that
no one's interests--left, center, or right--are served by a term whose
polar inversion of its earlier sense promotes the mistaking of partial
"culture" for total culture (or partial "cultures" for total cultures)?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps--except that "culture" has never <I>universally</I> been thought
to refer to something total, nor would it be wholly amiss to describe
the history of "culture" as a series of attempts to prove encompassing
what many imagine to be restricted in scope. We might recall, here,
that Arnold frames his <I>Culture and Anarchy</I>  as a response
to those who would dismiss "culture" as "a smattering of Greek and Latin
. . . begotten by nothing so intellectual as curiosity . . .

<B></B>

[and] valued either out of sheer vanity and ignorance, or else as an
engine of social and class distinction, separating its holder, like
a badge or title, from other people who have not got it." Certainly,
Arnold wanted to convince his readers that "no serious man would call
this <I>culture,</I>" and that authentic culture required a continuous and
ever-ramifying devotion to the pursuit of perfection; but he acknowledged
at the outset that there were (unserious) souls who would mistake it
for a detachable set of attainments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What has counted for many as both the originary and the defining use
 of "culture" in Anglo-American discourse, that is to say, begins with
 an admission that the term is a contested one, its associations with
 wholeness comprised by another usage affiliated with the contingent
 and the partial.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nor has culture ever been securely total on the anthropological side. Here
we might call up Hegeman on how an aspect of nineteenth-century "salvage
ethnography" persisted in anthropology well after 1900:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Salvage" had become . . . a nostalgic operation, recording ways of life
that were seen to be dying out in the face of encroaching assimilation and
modernization. As James Clifford has pointed out, the very structure of
the classic ethnography is based on this newer idea of salvage, which
both laments the inevitable loss of the other's 'culture' and then
reconstructs it as text." [34]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virtually from its inception, anthropology has been haunted by the worry
that once a group makes contact with modernity, its composite of beliefs
and practices may somehow cease to count as its authentic life way--the
fear that anything a modern person could actually lay his hands on would
fail to qualify as "culture," rigorously speaking. And as many moments
in the rest of Hegeman's book elegantly testify, it was but a small
step from this anxiety to the thought that modern societies might be as
incapable of producing a culture in the purest anthropological sense as
they were of generating full culture in the Arnoldian. In other words,
if "culture" was to denominate anything experienceable by modern people,
limits on the term's use might have to be relaxed sufficiently to admit
the partial after all.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Hegeman's modernists, as we've seen, that concession to partialness
didn't come easy: even regionalism, which might at first look like
an embrace of diversity, seems on closer inspection to be fueled by a
sort of melodrama of synecdoche. (Which region, complete in itself, will
stand for America as a unified whole? Which complex of traits will define
the region?) Yet it does seem worthwhile to ask whether the mistrust of
partialness in this period was as unrelieved as her survey implies. What
happens to the picture, we might ask, if we add to the mix a re like
Mead? At the end of <I>Coming of Age in Samoa</I> , after all,
Mead advises modern Americans to learn from Samoan educational practice
<I>not</I> in order to attain a unified culture, but in order to prepare
children for existence in a <I>dis</I>unified one whose wealth of options
may be admired as soon as regretted. "[W]hen no one group claims ethical
sanction for its customs, and each group welcomes to its midst only those
who are temperamentally fitted for membership," she concludes grandly,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
then we shall have realised the high point of individual choice and
universal toleration which a heterogeneous culture and a heterogeneous
culture alone can attain. Samoa knows but one way of life and teaches
it to her children. Will we, who have the knowledge of many ways, leave
our children free to choose among them?
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, Mead continues to refer to "our" culture in the singular,
but it's quite clear that if a yearning for lost unity lingers at all
here, it's balanced by a sense that such wholeness can't--and very likely
shouldn't--be the destiny of modern people. The knowledge of many ways
seems at least as promising a social formula as the limitation to one.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or suppose we consider the literature of canonical high modernism,
which depends for many of its effects on an encounter between a part
of life holding intense significance and a great remainder whose very
vacuousness, ironically, makes possible the intensity of the other.

<B></B>

The neatest example here may come from Virginia Woolf, whose "moments of
being" align closely with the cultural productions that count for her as
worthwhile; but if we want to stick with Americans we need only turn to
Eliot, who in spite of his critical invocations of the Arnoldian whole
produced a poetry that depended--more radically than almost anything in
nineteenth-century writing--upon a dialectic of the banal and the vital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 And even were we to limit ourselves to nonexpatriate Americans, in
 deference to the parameters of Hegeman's and Michaels's studies, we
 wouldn't have to go too far to find the same structure at work. Consider,
 as example, the re of Stevens, the lawyer-by-day / poet-by-night
 whose poetics locates value in "imagination" but requires also an
 antithetical term ("reality") for imagination to play upon and, in so
 doing, secondarily hallow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, high modernists didn't always name the meaning-bearing part of
life "culture." But it's important to see that in both their visions and
Mead's, the partialness associated with divided experience has a positive
aspect with immediate implications for cultural thinking. In both, the
intensity or plenitude deriving from meaning's localization makes it at
least possible to embrace (rather than lament) the difference between a
less happy but existentially richer "us" and a primitive "them" whose
culture remains unified and whole. It's understandable that modernist
scholarship has had more to say about the urge to go primitive than
about the urge to refrain; the latter is harder to detect, and where
construed as a claim of modern superiority could make one's chosen
authors look more ethnocentric than they otherwise would. Yet it would
surely be odd for us to imagine that the word "culture" could signify
both a modern person's acquaintance with arts and ideas (descendant of
Arnold's smattering of Greek and Latin) and the total set of practices
of a non-modern tribe <I>without</I> instilling some sense of parity
between a partialness proper to "us" and a wholeness proper to "them."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is to say, clearly, that one intriguing question left unexplored
by Hegeman concerns the ways in which modernism was inflected by the
assumed <I>a</I>symmetry between anthropological others and Arnoldian
selves--an aymmetry that may have diminished, and undoubtedly complicated,
the pathos of lost totality. Is it also to say, however, that in trying
to solve the dilemma of culture by embracing partialness more openly and
less guiltily, recent decades have only extended or brought to light
processes already at work in modernism? Not quite. For the innovation
of the later part of the century, in the U. S. at least, has not only
been to lower the temperature of remorse; it has also been to join
modernism's relatively abstract embrace of division in modern life to
sets of practices and beliefs associated with concretely nameable groups,
in this sense making the problem of "our" culture an anthropological
as well as an Arnoldian matter after all. For more and more Americans,
as we've already observed, it's not only that culture can be (coherent)
culture without being encompassing, but also that <I>a</I> culture can be
a (coherent) culture without constituting a totality. To say that recent
decades have moved to validate the partial along both "anthropological"
and "Arnoldian" lines, <I>and</I> made this validation the basis of a
new integration of the two, is in a way to say no more than that "my
culture" means less and less "the culture to which I belong," more and
more "a culture that belongs to me."

Hegeman's dismissal may be a little <I>too</I> brisk, inasmuch as it
passes over a key piece of Dominguez's argument. This is the point
that governments around the world invoke a quasi-Arnoldian sense of
"culture" in setting policies whose practical results (not to say
authentic motives) are worthy of scrutiny. For Dominguez, the problem
may be less the Eurocentrism of "culture" per se than the ways culture
has been "invoked to explain (justify?) continuing social, economic,
and political inequalities" . Thus Hegeman's comments on the place of
"culture" within the discourse of anthropology offer needed perspective
on Dominguez's claim that "the very notion of a cultural policy does
not allow the rebellious, populist, holistic Boasian sense of culture
to be employed," but they don't fully answer her questions about what
happens when people who contest the validation of European elements or
qualities nonetheless buy into "the elite European ideas that there is

Indeed the most disheartening aspect of Michaels's response to his critics
has been his resistance to the idea that the mistake of race might have
to be countered, in the world that we do have, by anything more than a
simple pointing to the fact of its mistakenness. The summer 1994 issue
of <I>Critical Inquiry</I> contains a critique of "Race into Culture"
in which Avery Gordon and Christopher Newfield argue that

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
civil rights era common sense . . . promotes discussion of racism in
all of its forms, particularly in its friendlier modern ones, like
institutional racism. It asks for increased use of the category of race
not because race is a biological fact or even because it defines one's
intrinsic personal or cultural identity but because it is one of the most
important principles by which U. S. social relations are organized. [740]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In their view, Michaels's essay provides a philosophical rationale for
an ascendant liberal racism that concentrates on the pure erroneousness
of race rather than on the consequences of that error's persistence;
this kinder, subtler form of racism, they write, takes comfort in the
proposition that "racism does not make people talk about race; talk
about race sustains racism." <I>Critical Inquiry</I> 20 (summer 1994):
739. Perloff makes a related point, commenting on Michaels's failure to
see that "[i]n an imperfect world, as the history of our brutal century
has taught us, identity is largely a question of how others perceive us"
.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both of these critiques are followed by responses from Michaels that,
while thoughtful enough on some fronts, strikingly evade the problem
at issue here. Michaels suggests that Perloff's remark encodes a strong
essentialist claim about the truth of identity, but this seems willful
obtuseness on his part, since it's clear in context that Perloff is
talking about how others' perceptions of what we are impinge on the lives
we lead, no matter whether these perceptions are true or false. Tellingly,
not to say astonishingly, he addresses Nazi persecution, her relevant
example, by asserting that we would have no grounds "for criticizing the
Nazis if we didn't think that their perceptions of Jewish identity were
<I>mistaken,</I>" as though brutality alone doesn't provide sufficient
matter for rebuke ("Response,"  3 [September
1996]: 122). Replying to Gordon and Newfield, meanwhile, Michaels rightly
defends reason as a principle of argument, but once again circumvents
the crucial point that we don't live in a world in which all parties
exercise reason all the time. Criticizing "social" recuperations of race,
he works several pages of analysis toward a culminating contention that
Gordon and Newfield "are obviously right: U. S. social relations have
been and continue to be organized in part by race. My point is that this
organization is the consequence of a mistake; and that antiessentialist
defenses of race amount to nothing more than new ways of making the
mistake" ("The No-Drop Rule," <I>Critical Inquiry</I> 20 [summer 1994]:
769). Yet this both restates Michaels's earlier position and ignores
Gordon and Newfield's major contention, which is not that race should
be defended as an abstractly significant essence, but that it should
continue to be discussed as a historically consequential category.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT13" HREF="#REF13">13</A>.
In his  response, however, Michaels summarizes
his thesis by claiming "that any notion of cultural identity that goes
beyond the description of our actual beliefs and practices must rely on
race (<I>or something equivalent, say, sex</I>) in order to determine
which culture is actually ours (121, emphasis added).

The nineteenth-century writing that most clearly marks an
exception to this rule--Baudelaire and company--is, of course,
also the nineteenth-century writing most often called modernist or
protomodernist. In <I>Notes</I> Eliot confronts something very much like
the modern condition as described by Mead when he asserts that the more
highly developed a culture is, the more likely it is to disintegrate
or fragment (22-6). Given that his desiderata are <I>both</I>
high development and integration, it's not surprising that he assesses
<I>any</I> society's chances of producing a culture worthy of regard
as slim.

Any attempt to summarize Stevens's thinking on imagination and reality
in a few words is bound to misrepresent it, as is any suggestion that it
finds a definitive articulation in any one text. Still, it's reasonable
to say that Stevens's nearest address to the question of culture and
partialness in modern life is also found in one of his fullest statements
on imagination, the 1948 essay "Imagination as Value" in <I>The Necessary
Angel</I> (New York: Knopf, 1951), 131-56.
