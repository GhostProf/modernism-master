<div class="attrib">
	--Oscar Wilde, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Woman of No Importance</span>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	  Reminiscing on his friendship with Oscar Wilde, the artist W. Graham Robertson recalls his ill-judged amusement on first hearing the playwright read aloud to him in French from the unfinished composition <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>: "[Wilde] had been reading his magnum opus," Robertson recollects, "and I had found it funny." Robertson, allowing that he quickly grasped his error, goes on to observe of the play this incongruity:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Salome, the schoolgirl, just home for the holidays, showing off her accomplishment at her mother's bidding, all unwitting of what "that one dancing of her feet" would bring forth, is an arresting little re; Salome, the wanton, dancing away the life of the man who scorned her and gloating over his severed head, is a theatrical commonplace.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Even for the inimitable Sarah Bernhardt, who, at the height of her celebrity, agreed to premiere Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> at the Royal English Opera House in June 1892, the role of guileless-princesscum-wily-harlot presented a challenge. To Robertson's query on whether the French actress would have a <span style="font-style:italic;">rante</span> dance in her place, Bernhardt countered, "I'm going to dance myself."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> That spectacle, as we know, never took place, as the Examiner of Plays Edward Pigott refused to license the drama then in rehearsals  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on the grounds of its profane biblical portrayals.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> By the 1930s, however, the play, with its disparate re "Salome the schoolgirl" and "Salome the wanton," Robertson observed at the time, had "taken hold upon the public imagination [and was] widely accepted as Holy Writ."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The irony of this volte-face shouldn't be overlooked. In the course of some four decades, Wilde's drama, with its seductive princess that the young Robertson thought amusingly discordant and the examiner of plays judged patently blasphemous, had moved from sacrilege to sacred "high art" text.
	</p>
<p>
	  The story of Wilde's provocative grain of sand twirled, as it were, into cultured pearl has, of course, never wanted for critical or scholarly attention. From the 1890s onward, the play has served as a lightning rod for divisive cultural issues: in its own time, over whether it should be performed as art or banned as sacrilege, and then and since, over its aberrant and unrestrained sexual exhibitionism. Yet Robertson's initial difficulty in reconciling royal schoolgirl and feral seductress, the one arresting, the other commonplace, gestures to a turn in sexual modernity whose cultural impact has still not been fully plumbed, either by scholars' work on art's secular trespass of the sacred or by their work on the play's arguable destabilizing of gender and sexual hierarchies. There is still more to the dissonance of schoolgirl turned voluptuary, especially considering the doyenne Bernhardt's resolve to dance the part compared with the censor Pigott's alarm over the biblical princess's sexual precocity. Indeed, I would go further to say that Wilde's two most outrageous and iconic res of the 1890s, the literary siblings Dorian Gray and Salome, point in tandem to a turn in sexual modernity that undercuts both religious and sexual orthodoxies foundational to the dominant ideology of a firmly ascendant bourgeoisie at the close of the nineteenth century. Wilde's pair of rebellious youths sensationalize the cultural disarrangement arising in the 1890s that would profoundly affect what it means to be a subject in post-industrial, post-consumerist late modernity.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Nor were the sensational antics of this literary pair alone in publicizing a modern sexual turn. The new subject formation that Wilde's novella and drama exposed to public scrutiny was being propounded as objective knowledge in the social sciences emergent in Wilde's time. Though attracting far less uproar, they too were instrumental in instigating this sexual modernization. On Wilde's behalf, we might say, to extend one of his better-known maxims, that when life imitates art, art is at least alert to the transaction. As Wilde expressed it near the end of the decade of his catastrophic downfall, "I had taken the Drama, the most objective form known to art, and made it as personal a mode of expression as the Lyric or the Sonnet, while enriching the characterisation of the stage, and enlarging--at any rate in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>--its artistic horizon."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Whether the same sensibility pertains to knowledge producers when life goes about imitating their ruminations remains to be seen.
	</p>
<p>
	  In this essay, I concern myself only with the eponymous Salome's role in the cultural revamping of the modern subject, specifically, the modern female subject. The scandalous re Wilde imagined in 1892 is exemplary of a modernization that some sixty years later Billy Wilder's film <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> would mock as pernicious dogma. To trace this arc of performance history, I first consider the antecedents of the Salome re  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in order to foreground Wilde's own distinctive innovations. I then read these against one prominent and contemporaneous corollary coalescing in the social sciences that portends the cultural transformation of sexual modernity under way by the end of the nineteenth century. Thereafter I consider <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> wider cultural impact, evidenced by the actresses, real and fictional, from Sarah Bernhardt to Norma Desmond, who sought to play the lustful princess. I suggest that as Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> transits from culturally transgressive to culturally prestigious art, it spawns an entire industry that, under the banner of Salomania, attracts and produces willing converts on and off stage and screen, and that results in a new, generalizable model of woman to whom we are now all beholden. Salome, the schoolgirl and wanton, becomes not just a theatrical but a cultural commonplace, prized by avant-garde and lowbrow alike, yet bearing within the tragic consequences Norma Desmond makes all too visible.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The naif and libertine that Wilde's script had so baldly fused into a single character to captivate London theatergoers in 1892 was, as is well documented, centuries in the making. The longevity of the Salome legend extends to biblical accounts of John the Baptist's beheading in the gospels of Mark and Matthew, which significantly refer only to the daughter of Herodias who dances. The distinction of naming Salome belongs to the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, writing in the first century who cites the princess by name yet curiously makes no mention of her grisly collusion in Herod Antipas's execution of John the Baptist, despite the historian's otherwise meticulous recitation of Herodian violence.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Noteworthy of the legend, however, is that even with its many ambiguities, "the re of the vengeful temptress," as Helen G. Zagona's study of the legend has pointedly observed, "[is divided] into two distinct personages, the provoked woman and the appealing girl who becomes the instrument of her revenge."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> So accepted was this division that "Herodias-Salome" acted as the legend's traditional moniker. This longstanding division makes the dissonance arising from the modern merger of the pair into a single innocent <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> culpable princess, which so struck Robertson, all the more telling.
	  </p>
<p>
	    It is with representations of the 1840s, however, that the legendary pair began to coalesce into a single sensuous and passionate re, richly signified in Heinrich Heine's long narrative poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Atta Troll</span> . Heine portentously joins angel and virago together in one character, albeit that of Herodias, who arises not from scripture and history but from folklore, and who is driven by an unrequited love of John the Baptist, manifest in her galloping about the midsummer countryside with the prophet's head in tow.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> More decisive in focusing on the Salome re herself are the paintings done over the next three decades. Among such works is Henri Regnault's sensuous portrait entitled simply "Salome" , which displays a very earthy princess whose coy smile belies the charger and dagger casually held in her lap as if they were mere culinary tools. Still more definitive are Gustave Moreau's two depictions, which shortly followed, that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> clearly denote a departure from the passive, Opheliaesque likenesses that depicted, in Bram Dijkstra's words, "the love-crazed self-sacrificial woman who most perfectly demonstrated her devotion to her man by descending into madness," once the rage at mid-century.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Moreau's depictions of a gauzily clad daughter of Judea in the oil painting "Salome Dancing before Herod" (c. 1876) and in the subsequent watercolor "The Apparition" (c. 1876) leave behind the legend's scriptural and Victorian bindings to embrace a new secular awareness of a youthful Salome as a licentious and blameworthy re in her own right. Their decadence is outrageously extended in Edouard Toudouze's realistic "Salome Triumphant" (ca. 1886).<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> His scarcely pubescent Salome, languorously recumbent on an ornate throne, impishly licking her fingers as she looks directly at the spectator, and seemingly untouched by the great calamity at her feet, offers the self-absorbed debauchery of nymphet harlotry, an unequivocal sign of the legend's modernization at the fin de siecle.
	  </p>
<p>
	    These artists' preoccupation with the spectacle of the Salome re is matched literarily by Gustave Flaubert's tale "Herodias"  and Joris-Karl Huysmans' decadent novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Against Nature</span> , which Wilde would later use to corrupt Dorian Gray. While Flaubert ostensibly refocuses his story on an eponymous Herodias, recapitulating Zagona's observation of a "vengeful temptress [divided] into two distinct personages," he nonetheless portrays the daughter Salome as a tempting sight from the outset of the story.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The one striking moment of mother/daughter identification comes as Salome removes her veil in prelude to her dance: "It was Herodias," the narrator observes, "as she used to look in her youth."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In this moment of resemblance, the youthful princess assumes precedence over her mother, and, in the thrall of her mesmerizing dance, delivered with half-closed eyes, rippling belly, and quivering breasts, Salome unconsciously beguiles an overly aroused tetrarch to deliver the prophet's head as a vengeful Herodias had schemed.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Joris-Karl Huysmans' <span style="font-style:italic;">Against Nature</span> takes Flaubert's near insensible dancing princess and renders her wholly spectacle, first as depraved erotic royalty and then outcast harlot. Under the dissipated connoisseurship of the reclusive protagonist Des Esseintes, who spends his evenings rapturously gazing at Moreau's two paintings, Salome moves from supreme object of ecstasy "that superhuman, strange Salome of whom he had dreamt" to "truly a whore, obedient to her temperament of a cruel and passionate woman."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Nowhere does the princess resemble the guileless, obedient daughter of Herodias, but appears rather as her own willing and wanton agent.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    It is this discursive and spectacular promiscuity that Wilde stages as performative and tragic. In the process, his interpretation becomes distinctly more radical. His Salome is not merely a tempting spectacle to be exploited, ogled, and denigrated. In stepping from print and canvas onto stage, Wilde's Salome now both looks and acts on her own, and thereby concentrates the legend's time-honored twin reference of "Herodias-Salome" to a single youthful temptress,<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> transforming the princess into  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the iconic re we recognize today. The play <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> becomes in time not just "Holy Writ," as Robertson observed, but its heroine becomes a re of near public worship as the princess makes the transit from culturally transgressive to culturally prestigious ornament post-Wilde.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The key innovation in Wilde's drama is that royal mother and daughter become patent rivals. While Herodias remains the depraved queen, the calculating and sterile wife of the former tetrarch's brother, she now protests rather than instigates her second husband's leering attention to her daughter and her dancing--and not because of maternal concern, but out of obvious envy. Mother and daughter's desires only converge with the beheading of the prophet, an act of cruelty Herodias can urge on Salome only from the periphery of the dramatic action. Wilde's upstaging of even a menacing Herodias points to an acute shift in cultural power that would have registered with a fin de siecle English audience by then keenly alert to the alarms raised over degeneracy and still subject to a long-reigning queen. At one extreme, Wilde's demotion of Herodias symbolically renders passe domestic ideology's sanctification of motherhood, already insinuated by her barrenness. At another, her evident lust, as a divorced woman married to her husband's brother, devalues that prized Victorian jewel, "the angel in the house." Wilde's dramatic rebuff serves not only to highlight Herodias's wickedness. It also brazenly transfers the prestige and power a woman enjoyed in marriage and motherhood to a mere youth, in this case an impulsive teenage princess, Graham Robertson's arresting schoolgirl. Wilde, I suggest, seizes from the strong-willed queen mother the lead role and emotional center of the drama, which had prevailed from the Evangelists to Flaubert, and confers them on her pubescent daughter, cast as sexually precocious and volatile. This was as radical a transposition as there could be in the 1890s, given the grave importance that high-minded bourgeoisie assigned to all matters sexual. Putting aside the play's prescience and prohibition for a moment, consider the hard time Wilde would serve for having his own amorous liaisons become public far too soon.
	  </p>
<p>
	    To make my point about Wilde's provocation of the fairer sex, however, allow me a brief excursus on similar literary works captivating the public imagination at the turn of the century. Like Wilde's drama <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, the popular thrillers <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span> by Bram Stoker  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Trilby</span> by Georges Du Maurier  shocked and excited audiences with their sensational representations of decollete ingenues who revealingly undergo a sexual awakening by paradoxically falling into a trancelike state. Stoker's Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray and Du Maurier's eponymous Irish <span style="font-style:italic;">grisette</span> Trilby O'Ferrall all experience a depraved seduction during somnambulistic episodes. In these accounts, Stoker and Du Maurier blur the boundaries separating their heroines' states of consciousness and unconsciousness, of knowledge and ignorance, of self-restraint and self-indulgence, in order to trigger other states, ones of restlessness and over-stimulation that seemingly incite these vulnerable protagonists, pubescent adolescents all, to act on carnal impulses loitering mutely below the threshold of their conscious selves, ready to burst forth when provoked. Female desires, in other words, too dangerous to countenance privately, were publicly exposed in print as lurking just beneath the surface of conscious volition--and all the more so when it came to youthful heroines. The cravings of these  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ingenues are shown to move from the inside out. Unconscious and irresistible, their inner stirrings are acted on and out in public, scandalizing and thrilling readers in turn, and so too with Wilde's aestheticized Salome.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Not only does Wilde turn the spotlight on the lissome princess in the foremost role of his dramatis personae, but he also makes unambiguous her libidinous transformation with his invention of the "dance of the seven veils." No single stage direction has likely been more provocative or had a greater impact on a play's interpretation than the simple coinage Wilde inserts in his script.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Salome's act of spellbound unveiling unleashes her latent, innermost desires, signaling her abandonment of girlhood, and her enthrallment links her to the sensational ingenues Lucy, Mina, and Trilby. The act makes visible her sexual latency first exhibited by her unbridled looking and arrogant commands, in keeping with a royal family steeped in profligacy against which a strident Baptist loudly rails. In such a milieu the surfeit of desires she arouses permeates the action of the play that the censor Pigott disparaged as "half-Biblical, half-pornographic."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> From the outset, Salome's nascent sexuality excites her illicit attraction to the prophet, provokes the captain of the guard to suicide, and tantalizes her uncle/stepfather the tetrarch, who offers to exchange anything in his possession for what amounts to a lap dance. For this one prurient diversion, he asks, commands, and implores his stepdaughter, despite her unequivocal and repeated refusal, "I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch," until she finally yields.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Once within the entranced state of her dance, in the thrall of her body's movement, so sensationally described by Flaubert and Huysmans, latency becomes reality. She undergoes a sexual initiation even more scandalous, with its whiff of incestuous royal congress, than Stoker's or Du Maurier's vulnerable heroines. Thereafter, a debauched princess cruelly demands Jokanaan's head, announcing in effect her own sexual emancipation: "I do not heed my mother. It is for mine own pleasure that I ask the head of Jokanaan in a silver charger."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This she then confirms by ecstatically kissing the prophet's bloody mouth.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, excessive and perverse desires lead a self-absorbed princess into transgressions that stun even a dissolute tetrarch. Nevertheless, it is the adolescent Salome, as subject and object of manifold desires, who is the trigger for the chaos that descends upon the royal household. When the tetrarch commands, "Kill that woman!" the great incongruity of schoolgirl turned wanton that troubled Robertson is played out.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> And yet, Herod's denunciation of his stepdaughter as "that woman," which conceals his own culpability, stamps the youthful Salome less as murderous woman and more as a "<span style="font-style:italic;">petite fille fatale</span>."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Qualms over Salome's transformation from spoiled princess to predatory courtesan expressed by censor, critic, and public would erupt over its staging in Britain for more than four decades. The drama's treatment of promiscuity, incest, and revenge, which hinge on a preternaturally aroused teenage princess, caused public controversy despite the ban on its public performance.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Yet Wilde's portrayal of a nubile princess's sexual initiation and of the transgressions that transpire at Herod's court marked a disarrangement of power relations around sexual latency that had even more determinant representations in the social sciences, with far less public outcry, a decisive instance of which I now take up.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    Among the many counterparts to Salome's transformation that we might identify in the social sciences contemporaneous with Wilde's sensational fin de siecle drama, Sigmund Freud's fragment on Dora famously stands out. It works expressly through a similar use of trancelike states under the rubric of dreamwork to arrive at a depraved seduction that marks Dora, like Salome, as both source and sorcerer. And in step with Wilde's princess and with Stoker's and du Maurier's susceptible youths, Dora's motivation coheres with the modern formulation of depth psychology, arising as it does from innermost desires of which she is unaware--a formula with which Freud notably attempts and fails to make his female protagonist complicit.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet as demonstrative as is Freud's analysis of a schoolgirl's alleged secret lust, a broader and more useful model for the categorical shift under way, one that also accounts for Dora's predicament, is the accession of a new subject on the modern scene, the re of the adolescent. In hindsight, the works of Wilde, Stoker, Du Maurier, as well as Freud, appear not merely to coincide with but more accurately to correspond with the theorization in the social sciences in the 1890s of this highly sexualized and unstable category. Indeed, a licentious Salome meets all the criteria--highly impressionable, sensation-driven, self-indulgent, extremely excitable--judged characteristics of adolescence according to its principal theorist and popularizer, G. Stanley Hall.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In his monumental two-volume study <span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, written in the 1890s, Hall declares adolescence to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> decisive phase of human, not just female, maturation, one therefore in urgent need of objective investigation that the social sciences were best suited to furnish. Calling adolescence a second birth, as critical an event as biological birth, Hall effectively grants "the period of sexual maturity" its own privileged social and cultural space, and demarcates it as an object of knowledge to be studied (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 1:xiii, 2:40).
	  </p>
<p>
	    We may gather what is at stake during this precarious state of disequilibrium from Hall description that adolescence "is preeminently the age of sense, and hence prone to sensuousness not only in taste and sex, where the danger is greatest, but in the domain of each of the sense species." And, he continues, "whatever our philosophy, it is never so nearly true as at this age, that there is nothing in the intellect that does not get there through the senses, for now the chief activity of the mind is working over the sense capital thus acquired" (2:38-39). The dangers of adolescence, Hall states, "are part of the price modern man must pay for the prolonged prenubile apprenticeship to life" (2:108n1).<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> As in the works of his contemporaries in the arts, including Wilde's version of Salome, Hall's exploration of adolescence marks it as a dangerous and sensation-driven condition, a universal period of great instability and of de facto licensed hedonism, and a state requiring the most vigilant supervision--supervision that is not to be found in Salome's permissive royal family.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Hall, a committed Darwinist, attributes this economic apprenticeship of the senses to sexual evolution and to what he views as humankind's increasing advancement. Yet in a curious turn he ascribes both the evolution and advancement not to nature per se, but to modernization. As he puts it, the "progressive increase of this interval is,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in his judgment, "another index of the degree of civilization" (2:232). In other words, human sexual evolution is fundamentally progressive and dependent on civilization's advance. Correspondingly, the more civilized and the more modern humans become, the more acute, prolonged, and unstable becomes "the period of sexual maturity."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The price of modernity, then, is protracted adolescence--with, however, two notable qualifications. "Primitives" and women, according to Hall, lacking the same evolutionary aptitude as men, are not advantaged by modernization to the same degree, but persist in a near perpetual state of adolescence.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Their virtually irremediable circumstance, while it necessitates greater disciplinary oversight on their behalf, does not, however, trouble his larger argument. Nor, instructively, does the logic that advanced civilization only lengthens rather than reduces the duration of adolescence for those most favored with evolutionary potential. For the privileged among the male sex, the more modern a society, the longer the apprenticeship of adolescence. Strikingly, and for those who are evolutionarily advantaged and those less advantaged, adolescence moves from being understood as an acute final stage of human maturation to a chronic condition of modernity. The brevity of youth is suddenly conceived as lasting progressively longer, conditional on sustained modernization. In a sense, Hall's treatment of adolescence entwines the time of adolescence and modernity itself, making them mutually constitutive. In so doing, Hall and his successors in the social sciences turn what is at first conceived as a passing stage of hedonistic experimentation into a distinct and recognizable subject, a full-blown re, the adolescent, while at the same time tacitly indicating that the duration of the developmental stage is open-ended.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Such teleology implies lifelong adolescence, or, put another way, youthfulness becomes teleological. Rather than a prerequisite of adulthood, adolescence emerges as a dynamic and distinct condition, an engine of intense vitality enticing all ages.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Granting its attraction, we might more productively view adolescence from Hall forward as a modern cultural phenomenon and apparatus, instead of the recognizable ahistorical and universal re delineated in the social sciences. Though the re of the adolescent did aggregate new forms of capital, consciousness, and identity in youthfulness across gender, class, race, and national lines, it eventually exceeded, as Hall anticipated, the temporal and taxonomic limits once accorded it as the period of adolescence lengthened. But when viewed instead as a cultural apparatus, adolescence can also be seen putting in motion new expressions of subjectivity concurrent with metropolitan populations ever more prone to excitement, novelty, and innovation, and ever more obsessed with their own sensual gratification. This is the precise dilemma that Wilde's most iconic heroine Salome presciently throws into relief. Though the subjectively disorienting effects of modernizing, consumption-oriented, urban life may not have exact equivalents in an opulent and licentious royal household of ancient Judea, Wilde's drama does bespeak the modern anxieties of an era branded as "decadent" on one side of the Atlantic and "gilded" on the other, both distinguished by their conspicuous consumption. In consequence, it is no great leap to suggest that the representative of Hall's state of unleashed hedonism may be found in a spoiled Salome's enraptured dance of the seven veils, her enthrallment signifying, like her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> entranced fin de siecle counterparts, her awakened adolescence. Let me further suggest that such enthrallment would come to attract more than one princess aspirant and, given its cultural enticements, even those disqualified by age. All of the foregoing speaks to the disarrangement of power relations lodged in the social science category of adolescence and in the self-identified subjects who would come to imitate and then practice it--changes that the performance of Wilde's play provocatively stages.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The early decades of the twentieth century saw the Salome craze precipitated by Wilde's transgressive play effervesce on more than one continent. To suggest the play's reach, consider its performance in Japanese theaters from 1914 to 1926 that Ayako Kano documents as being truly transformative of women. Besides Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, Kano credits such plays as Henrik Ibsen's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll House</span>  and George Bernard Shaw's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Warren's Profession</span> (1893-94) with introducing the "New Woman" to modern Japanese theater and its audiences.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> These dramas gave actresses, who had only just regained the stage after a hiatus of four centuries, roles that were at once emotionally and physically demanding. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> in particular, Kano contends, "the alignment between gender, sex, sexuality, and performance" underwent a profound and sudden shift "from gender defined as theatrical achievement [i.e., gender as artifice, that which male actors had for centuries performed], to gender defined as grounded in the visible body and as basis for theatrical expression."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> With estimates of the number of different productions of Wilde's play performed in a twelve-year period ranging from 27 to more than 120, most of these concentrated in Tokyo, little wonder that young women would take to styling their hair in a fashion they dubbed "<span style="font-style:italic;">Salome-Maki</span>" in imitation of the hedonistic re.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Salomania had taken hold.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Yet when Kano avers that Salome "epitomized the new definition of womanhood as rooted in the physical body and of woman's body as the basis for acting," what perhaps went unasked is exactly which model of the modern woman was being performed on stage and copied off.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> To answer, I suggest two related innovations: under the avatar of <span style="font-style:italic;">liberating modernity</span> we observe none other than the <span style="font-style:italic;">sexualized adolescent</span> body. In other words, the new generalized category of "woman" arising from the outre re of Salome relies on an adolescent model that is constitutive of modernity, as Hall's theory implied, and is emancipatory to boot, at least according to Kano. The performance of this "new definition of womanhood" begins to resemble not a little our fin de siecle ingenues' enthralled emancipation from girlhood, but with this complication: actresses in the footlights and their imitators in the audience had not only to perform Salome's adolescent body but significantly look the part too. And from the outset, whether in Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Paris, London, or New York, there was no shortage of actresses and dancers--and sopranos, in the case of Richard Strauss's operatic adaptation--on several continents vying to perform the role. Nor was there an end to the Salomania their performances excited, as has been shown by William Tydeman, Stephen Price,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Robert Tanitch, and, more recently, by Peter Wollen, Susan Glenn, and Ayako Kano.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Along with the Japanese actresses drawn early to the role, such as Kawakami Sadayakko, Matsui Sumako, and Shokyokusai Tenkatsu, we can add those in the West--among them, Sarah Bernhardt, Loie Fuller, Maud Allan, Alla Nazimova, Tilla Durieux, Ada Overton Walker, Theda Bara, Ida Rubenstein, and Gloria Swanson. By 1930, a transgressive <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> prestigious Salome had become a thriving industry.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The paradox from the start was that the leading actresses who could rightly command the role of Salome scarcely resembled a nubile princess, as was obvious in Wilde's first choice for the role, Sarah Bernhardt. Although Wilde would claim in 1900 that age had nothing to do with acting and that Bernhardt, alone, was best suited to carry off the part of the licentious princess, a role he was never to see performed, the "Divine Sarah" was already a generous forty-eight years when she agreed in 1892 to perform Salome, and to include the notorious dance of the seven veils.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is certainly true that the celebrated Bernhardt's stage stamina was unmatched, that her slender re well into middle-age made possible a classical and popular repertoire of dramatic roles as virgins, saints, harlots, peasants, princesses, and queens, and that Bernhardt's grand style and Wilde's symbolist drama hardly invited a realistic presentation in any event. Yet despite its symbolist ambitions, there is still no getting around the outre spectacle the play made of the pubescent body of the youthful Salome. Nor is there getting around how Bernhardt's body was to be veiled and unveiled during her seductive caper--a robing/disrobing that was set to rely, in an ironic twist, on stage costumes from her role as Cleopatra. Bernhardt's suitability for the role led Vincent O'Sullivan, the American writer and sometime confederate of Wilde, to remark: "It is a hard strain on plausibility," he remarked, "to see Wilde's 'Salome' played by even a young actress."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> And Bernhardt, at forty-eight, was to his mind an inappropriate choice. Marguerite Coe suggests that audiences may have agreed, because the sensuous roles Bernhardt did perform between 1890 and 1902 were not well received, leading the stage doyenne to adopt more <span style="font-style:italic;">travesti</span> parts during the last two decades of her career in addition to her tried and true revivals.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Still, there remained talk on the circuit that Bernhardt would one day take the role of Salome.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> While age may not have deterred middle-age actresses like Bernhardt from the role of a lascivious princess, the opposite did not obtain. Take the reaction of another of Wilde's actress-heartthrobs when asked by the dramatist to play the mature Mrs. Erlynne, who has an adult illegitimate daughter, for <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> . Affronted, Lillie Langtry asked Wilde: "[A]m I old enough to have a grown-up daughter of any description?"<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Ironically, the honor of debuting the role of Salome did fall to a mother of an adult daughter, the forty-six-year-old French actress Lina Munte. Munte's early theater credits included roles in such sensational dramas as Alexandre Dumas' <span style="font-style:italic;">La Dame aux Camelias</span>, Emile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assommoir</span>, Catule Mendes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span> before a decade spent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Moscow and a return to Paris in 1893 led to a connection with theater director and actor Aurelien Lugne-Poe and the leading role of Salome.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was Lugne-Poe's experimental and private Theatre de l'Oeuvre, founded in Paris in 1893, that staged the world premiere of Wilde's play in 1896, albeit "world premiere" is slightly misleading. To circumvent possible legal interdiction, the play was not announced until the last minute and, as further insurance, the part of the page was assigned the actress Suzanne Despres in order to accentuate the surfeit of female passion on display and minimize the drama's homoeroticism, a modification that Strauss's opera would maintain on similar grounds.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> And apparently, the exhibition of female desire succeeded. Jean de Tinan, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France</span>, fairly effused of Munte's performance that no other actress "would have allowed me to feel the shiver of feverish sensation that Mlle Lina Munte provided me in <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> That critics singled out her voice and beauty over any mesmerism of her dance may be explained by the challenge of twirling about with a patched-up orb serving as the unfortunate prophet's head, which had been shattered to pieces in the final rehearsal.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

	    Although a second production was not mounted until the start of the new century, Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> would enjoy a remarkable run in its many guises, ranging from high to low culture, generating Salomania wherever it appeared--on stage, in print, in design, in fashion, in opera, in photography, in film, and worldwide in theaters, concert halls, runways, tent shows, and vaudeville houses--and earning its mantle as a veritable industry, several examples of which indicate the great pull the re of Salome exercised on the public imagination.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    That Wilde's entire drama could be reduced to the single performance of "the dance of the seven veils," on which whole careers were spun, indicates just how tantalizing and wide-ranging was <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> appeal. Among the most successful interpreters of the dance was the Canadian-born Maud Allan who, in 1905, used Salome to launch her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> career as performer. Her dance <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vision of Salome,</span> which sheared off all of the play but the biblical princess's erotic whirling, not to mention everything else but a few jewels, two breastplates, and some diaphanous fabric, captivated audiences. Exhibiting female sexual latency unleashed through dance, Allan encapsulated the princess's transformation from naive to concupiscent ingenue, and her performance made her the toast of London and beyond for almost a decade with her lithe body, girlish re, and "kittenish immaturity"--fame that lasted into her late thirties.

	    Her decision to stage a comeback in 1918 is instructive of the profound impact that adolescent hedonism was having on the public imagination by the second decade of the century. As well, her decision to do so in her mid-forties shows how irresistible Salomania was for a middle-age actress attempting to regain the limelight. In 1918 Allan agreed to perform Salome's dance as part of her dramatic lead in a full-scale London production of Wilde's play. Yet, her Salome set in motion a legal wrangle and national scandal more reactionary than the censor Pigott's some twenty-five years earlier. Allan's celebrated case was precipitated by the virulently jingoistic M.P. Noel Pemberton-Billing,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who blatantly engineered a public provocation by accusing the performer in print of a "cult of the clitoris." Allan's predatory sexuality was alleged to be so alluring and pervasive that she and her devotees were jeopardizing Britain's war effort. Allan and producer J. T. Grein accordingly sued Billing for libel, occasioning the trial that surpassed <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> in sheer sensationalism, with unfounded fantasies about Allan's sexual proclivities passed off as expert medical testimony by the physician Serrell Cooke.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Allowed into the record, Cooke's allegations proved decisive in Billing's favor. At forty-five, Allan stood condemned, for all intents and purposes, of a convincing performance of a depraved pubescent teenager. Acting and looking the part, the mature Allan had become the depraved adolescent Salome. The actress <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> the sordid princess, an out-f-control teenager threatening the safety of the British realm in wartime--a contorted and ludicrous instance of life imitating art that might have amused Wilde had not the consequences for Allan and company proved so damaging, as were those that followed Wilde's own trials. Yet while Billing, like Herod, had succeeded in condemning "that woman," the scandal hardly grazed Salome's popularity. In fact, outrageous as were Billing's accusations against Allan, what he ultimately feared was very close to what that modern Babylon, Hollywood, was fast concocting.
	  </p>
<p>
	    An ocean and continent away, in the very same year of Allan's courtroom scandal, silver-screen siren Theda Bara had been performing her own shocking rendition of a decadent Salome on a Fox studio set in the California desert. The notable shift from the promiscuous Salome dramatized by Wilde to the promiscuous Salome the actress, so scandalous in the Billing libel suit, was in fact the raison d'etre of the costly feature-length film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, starring the vampish actress. Bara, considered Hollywood's first manufactured celebrity of a studio system bent in 1918 on turning the new medium of film into a commercial "dream factory," was a bit player when discovered by William Fox in 1914. Fox chose Bara on the advice of theater producer Robert Hilliard for the starring role in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fool There Was</span>, an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem "The Vampire." Hilliard had counseled Fox that it was far more lucrative to "put the girl you choose under contract, and the part will make her" than to negotiate contracts with well-known, pricey, and temperamental actresses.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The vampire role of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fool There Was</span> turned Bara into a star overnight, helped by an entirely fictionalized background fabricated on her behalf by studio publicists. In advance of the film's 1915 release, they provided Bara with an exotic orientalized past that, for a time, the press and public swallowed whole. Conceived in the shadow of the Sphinx, she was alleged to be the progeny of an Italian painter father and a French actress mother. In reality, she was Theodosia Goodman, born to an unexceptional Jewish family in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1885.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> But that was not the only hoax. Significantly, Fox's publicists shaved five years from Bara's age, giving her birth year as 1890. The five-year subtraction was insurance that Bara would appear in 1915 as an irresistible vamp just at the limits of adolescence, and not be mistaken for the mature woman she already was at age thirty.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Maturity, in short, had become a liability in an industry rapidly becoming dependent on celebrities and close-ups.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The lengths taken to identify Bara with the vamped ingenues whose awakened sexuality rocked readers at the fin de siecle highlight the flagrant staginess film studios  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> deliberately exploited as the studio system took hold. The trancelike states late Victorian thrillers had imposed on vulnerable heroines were now cast on performers and public alike. Film made Bara that creature commodity, a star, and one that studios could reproduce continuously as the industry grew, to satisfy a mass audience's whetted appetite for vampish roguery. Between 1915 and 1920, the actress starred in forty feature-length motion pictures, ten alone in 1915, driven by a mania for her tantalizing seductiveness.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> The upshot was, as Kevin Starr points out in his study of progressive-era Hollywood, that Bara made overt female sexuality, however outre, compelling and imitable in the late 1910s, similar to the effect of the stage performances of Japanese actresses above.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The difference, however, was the scale of reproduction. We might say in today's patois that Bara's forty films helped ensure that the adolescent model of female sexuality went viral. A case study in mechanical <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> vampiric--that is, proliferative--reproduction, wholly ungrounded in any material reality, Bara became that modern creature, a mass commodity, albeit an extremely valuable one as Robert Hilliard had anticipated. In tandem with that commodification came a generalizable woman based on the inflated transgressions of late adolescence. We might say that the thirty-three-year-old Bara's starring performance as Salome negated the incongruity Robertson observed in 1892, making the teenage temptress a "theatrical commonplace."

	    The actress's manufactured stardom, beholden to roles that trace back to the depraved young heroines of Stoker's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span>, made the part of a transgressive Salome  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ideally suited to Bara's notoriety as a vamp, thus signifying that it was the princess Salome who fit the celebrity Bara and not the other way around, the reversal that had caused Allan such distress before a London magistrate. Yet while the part may have been a perfect fit, the thirty-something Bara's mature body was apparently not. Two years earlier, when Fox cast Bara to play the youthful Juliet for his 1916 production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Romeo and Juliet</span>, there was worry over "large, bosomy, and rather heavily thighed Theda with Romeo's poetic outpourings of his love, which would be flashed on the screen in subtitles."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Such talk followed her onto the set of her 1917 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Cleopatra</span>, with one press member calling her Cleopatra "plump."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Whether because of this comment or the prospect of more costumes of breastplates, pearls, and chiffon, Bara undertook stringent dieting to reduce her weight in 1918 for <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, the thinnest she would be in any film.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Notwithstanding her countless fans or great celebrity, Bara's struggle to look <span style="font-style:italic;">la petite fille fatale</span> clearly demonstrates the prestige of the idealized adolescent body: it was not enough to <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span> Salome or Salome to <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span> her, the actress had to <span style="font-style:italic;">look</span> the adolescent part as well, no matter the health cost to an adult woman. More to the point, Bara's crash-dieting materially and symbolically captures the reverse of the excited enthrallment that swirled our fin de siecle ingenues into adolescence. Instead of hypnotic dance moves launching adolescence, Bara gives us the lengths a mature woman would take to return to its hedonic state--no less a performance, a point elaborated below.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The finished eight-reel film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, with a cast of two thousand and a set constructed by eight hundred artisans, was promoted by the studio as based on the historian Josephus to skirt censorship. Bearing little resemblance to the historian's account, the film was also a significant departure from Wilde's. Gone is Herodias the mother, and all who appear in her wake seem mere servings to slake Salome's thirst for mayhem. Over the course of the film, the princess, now the cousin of the tetrarch Herod, has David the High Priest drowned; attempts first to poison Herod's wife, Miriam, and then has Herod execute her; and, on the heels of her signature dance, demands and kisses the prophet's head; thereafter, with her execution looming, an immense desert storm swirls; roll credits.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Noting that the film had "few equals," the reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> singled out Bara, who was "every minute the vampire, in manner and movement and expression."<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> In a word, the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> spectacularized adolescent sexuality. Despite its popularity and though Bara fiercely defended her artistic rendering of Salome, the film would be her last major motion-picture credit.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> By 1919, the box office made clear that the now thirty-four-year-old vamp wasn't the must-see siren she had been. Revealingly, both Allan and Bara, who each enjoyed a near meteoric rise in popularity, had no real public platform once their performance of transgressive sexual exhibitionism had played out. Their careers indicate that on twentieth-century film sets as well as, increasingly, on the stage, age and acting, life and art, intermingled--as they had not in the era when the Divine Sarah first commanded the boards. Suggestive of modernity's infatuation and entwinement with adolescence, an actress lacking a youthful appearance was at risk of losing her stardom and her profession.
	  </p>
<p>
	    One additional instance, the exceptional 1923 film by Alla Nazimova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome, An Historical Phantasy by Oscar Wilde</span>, exemplifies the great attraction of Salome's sexual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hedonism and actresses' attempt to achieve the youthful looks that kept them relevant and marketable. Nazimova's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> would be the first full-scale production of Wilde's play by a woman, and not just any woman but a highly regarded actress. In contrast to Allan and Bara, Nazimova, a Russian Jewish emigre who had studied with Stanislavsky, was a serious actress with impressive stage and film credentials. Having arrived in the United States in 1905 with virtually no English, she quickly mastered the language and the New York stage with performances in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hedda Gabler</span>, and took that success onto the silent screen, acting in eleven films by 1918 for Metro Pictures before venturing to produce and star in motion pictures based on the avant-garde dramas of her stage career. A celebrity but no studio makeover, Nazimova singularly fashioned her own stardom. At the height of her career she personified Hollywood's glitzy notoriety with her palatial Sunset Boulevard estate, wild parties, and stormy liaisons with both sexes. As much a diva as Bernhardt, her flair for the avant-garde, her extravagance, her flamboyant and uninhibited lifestyle marked her a 1920s liberated and very modern woman.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Nowhere are these attributes more vibrantly exhibited than in Nazimova's highbrow experimental interpretation of Wilde's play, a far remove from Fox's commercial epic. Lavish in its Aubrey Beardsley-inspired costumes, art deco tableaux, and stylized camera work, hers is a stunning amalgamation of fin de siecle and 1920s aesthetics. There is, moreover, a striking resemblance in pose and affect between Nazimova's pouty, self-absorbed Salome and Toudouze's 1886 nymphet in "Salome Triumphant." Their similarity suggests that Nazimova's rendition aimed precisely at representing Salome as a youthful, self-absorbed, pampered, and impetuous adolescent in order to dramatize both the young princess's sexual awakening and her hedonic excess once aroused and spurned within a decadent palace. That her film remains an exceptional instance of female modernism, as Patricia White maintains, is unquestioned.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> But the film also operates in the broader cultural context where adulthood was being overtaken by an adolescent model in which all expressions of embodied female sexuality, no matter how polymorphously transgressive, were implicated.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In taking the role of Salome, the actress emphatically insisted on representing the princess as a fourteen-year-old adolescent, something of a challenge for the forty-two-year-old actress despite her very slender, gamine-like re.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> The film's opening credits even make a show of the princess's innocent youthfulness, identifying her as "an uncontaminated blossom in a wilderness of evil."<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Nor was the princess Salome the first role in which Nazimova would actively try to conceal her middle age, according to her biographer, Gavin Lambert. For the role of Nora in her production of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span> , film photographer Charles Van Enger "made Nazimova look ten years younger, not by obvious soft focus but by subtle control of lighting."<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Van Enger applied this same lighting technique to <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> with great effect. In addition, art director Natacha Rambova (nee Winifred Shaughnessy) designed special costumes to slenderize the actress's re to pubescent thinness, particularly for her provocative dance of the seven veils, by using "a sheathlike tunic of white satin, with a rubber lining (specially made by a manufacturer of automobile tires) that clung to her body."<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Innovative lighting  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to mask her age and costumes to compress her re were effective in medium- and long-range shots of the actress. Yet it was one thing for a forty-two-year-old Nazimova to look the part of the fully clothed, young mother Nora and quite another to seem a teenager en deshabille in <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>. Lighting and costume were little help in close-ups of the actress, and for close-ups no mere <span style="font-style:italic;">rante</span> could be substituted. These shots made all too apparent the incongruity of Nazimova's performance as a royal nymphet.

<p>
	    As with Bara's strict dieting, Nazimova's squeezing into a rubberized white tunic to effect a fourteen-year-old body makes clear the reverse transformation expected of a mature actress to embody the role of the nubile princess. Indeed, Nazimova's contortion may be different in kind, but it is hardy different in effect from the constrictive binding of that Victorian relic, the corset. The symbolic valence of this <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, notwithstanding its aesthetic bravura and present-day cult following, cannot be overstressed, especially given that the actress Nazimova and the designer Rambova were both self-identified, ultra-modern female artists. As a film of its time, Nazimova's performance in an avant-garde production, as was Bara's in a commercial production and Allan's in a courtroom, actively promoted the adolescent Salome as the embodiment of a modern woman's liberated sexuality--that this performance was also a marked liability for her mature body was rapidly becoming an open secret.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The radical performances of these mature actresses highlight the extraordinary change occurring to the definition of woman that the director Billy Wilder makes the tragic focal point of the 1950 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, featuring in the marquee role the fifty-one-year-old former Hollywood silent-screen star Gloria Swanson.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> In addition to the critiques of the film as a <span style="font-style:italic;">noir</span> indictment of the studio system, of celebrity culture, of a decadent Hollywood, and of a corrupt postwar America, let me also propose that the fifty-year-old silent-screen diva Norma Desmond played by Swanson is Wilde's Salome <span style="font-style:italic;">in extremis</span>, and, for Wilder, the abandoned love child of the silent-screen era--the modern woman. The once glamorous Desmond, casualty of the talkies, lives on in the occluded interior of a crumbling Hollywood mansion where time has ceased. The celluloid realm of film and a phantom one of fans substitute for the outside world. The one physic needed to restore the aging film star to her lost grandeur of the 1920s and to her adoring fans, whose fan mail her butler Max, former husband and onetime director, sedulously forges, is a major starring role. That role, the one that she has been adapting in seclusion for years and that ensnares the down-on-his-heels screenwriter Joe Gillis, who scrambles onto her driveway on the lam from repo-agents, is, of course, none other than Salome. From the opening sequence that closes in on a shot of a dead Joe Gillis, the audience knows that the head of this hapless Hollywood-diviner-cum-diffident-gigolo floating faced down in a cistern will land on a platter. And thus it comes as no surprise at the film's end that the last close-up of the once incomparable Norma Desmond will likely be a mug shot. Though the film relies on the cynical Gillis's posthumous voiceover, and thus we see Desmond's pent-up desires only through his jaded perspective, it is Desmond's tragic downfall in tandem with and in thrall to the role of Salome that the film chronicles.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Everywhere insinuated is the decadence of this modern Babylon and its royalty. The cutthroat and philistine studio system that the disillusioned Gillis, played by William Holden, quips can turn a script about Okies in the dust bowl into a movie shot on a torpedo boat is one with the extravagant spectacle of Cecil B. DeMille's set of <span style="font-style:italic;">Samson and Delilah</span>, itself an ironic jab at commercial screen epics still being cranked out at midcentury. Compared with the money-hungry and heady make-believe world of the studio, Desmond's setting offers up a fantastic, if desiccated, dominion. The vaulted and ornate interior of her "grim Sunset castle" evokes an overwrought and oppressive mausoleum, with its obsessed denizen a pale descendant of the entranced ingenues who once stalked the pages of fin de siecle thrillers.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Gillis notably calls Desmond "a sleepwalker," adding, "still sleepwalking along the giddy heights of a lost career, plain crazy," an aimless enthrallment compared to her youthful forerunners.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> As well, he mordantly dubs Desmond's bridge partners, a trio of faded silent-film stars, the "Waxworks." Decay and decrepitude abound, which the brash Gillis misses no opportunity to disparage, even down to Desmond's tuberose fragrance, a funereal blossom in its Victorian heyday.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The elixir that will rejuvenate the actress, however, is the role of Salome, and the unexpected appearance of the writer Gillis provides the opportunity. "What a woman!"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> she exclaims to Gillis, waving reams of pages for the script. "What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy Man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on golden tray, kissing his cold dead lips."<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Her excitement makes clear that Desmond's florid Salome is no fledgling teenage temptress but first and foremost "that woman," who loves, is scorned, and murders. Enlisting Gillis in her fantasy, the self-absorbed Desmond seems unaware of the incongruity of a fifty-year-old playing an alluring temptress, much less a teenage nymphet on screen. In her self-delusion, the actress imagines that here at last with Gillis's help is her chance to stage, not "a comeback," as that would admit an all-too-depressed reality, but a "return," a nostalgic homecoming to the make-believe of the cinema, a realm more palpable and meaningful than her buried life. Agreeing to edit the script to earn some quick cash, Joe exploits her delusion as he belittles her draft as a "silly hodge-podge of melodramatic plots" written in a "childish scrawl."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> From the charged exchange in which the actress, thrusting the pages of her adaptation at Gillis, insists, "Read the scene just before she has him killed!" forward to the film's denouement, it is possible to see Wilde's play unfolding inside <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    If life imitates art, as Wilde had glibly put it, then by 1950 it is also clear that the art of film had made imitation all the more arduous, if not outright dangerous, especially for mature actresses like Desmond. In contrast to Wilde's symbolist evocation of Salome's desires, Wilder's film offers a bleaker representation of Norma's. His <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> notably employs the same documentary style he experimented with as a young journalist in his collaboration on the 1929 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Menschen am Sonntag</span> and later employed on his 1948 film <span style="font-style:italic;">A Foreign Affair</span>, which spliced shots of Berlin's ruins into the narrative. To expose the destructive effects of a corrosive film industry on the people it employed, the director interweaves the fictional scenario with a pseudo-documentary reality. Wilder conspicuously filmed scenes of local Hollywood haunts, solicited such industry personalities as DeMille and Hedda Hopper to play themselves, and engaged former silent-film actors as Norma's bridge partners, among whom, had Charles Brackett's invitation been accepted, Theda Bara herself would have counted.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Yet Wilder's determination to make a documentary-style film led him to reproduce some of the very excesses his industry expose was meant to unmask. As biographer Maurice Zolotow indicates, Wilder insisted on casting an actress who had once been a silent-screen star in the 1920s for Desmond's role.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Wilder reasoned, "it's very difficult to find a woman in her sixties, let us say, who is undiscovered--where was she until sixty? It would be hard to believe she was ever a big star. So we went after one who had been big."<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> In this tautology, Wilder acknowledges the importance that a youthful appearance had come to exercise in film <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> equally the ruin its loss meant by casting about for an actress who had apparently lived that very calamity. And according to Zolotow, although there was no shortage of fading stars that fit the bill, finding one to agree to play a true-to-life Norma was something else. Not unlike Freud's Dora, more than a few actresses refused to go along with Wilder's make-believe, among them Mae West, Greta Garbo, Pola Negri, and Mary Pickford.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> At last, Swanson, still a working actress as well as businesswoman living in New York, reluctantly accepted the part  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that at fifty-one would ironically ensure her lasting stardom, not to mention countless picture offers to reprise the role of a forgotten movie star.<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> However, had he determined to exploit it, Wilder might have made Swanson's selection as a former darling of the silent screen even more believable. The director could have shown the actress at the height of her celebrity in her 1925 Paramount film <span style="font-style:italic;">Stage Struck</span> as small-town waitress Jennie Hagen who, in a dream montage, imagines herself playing an alluring Salome shamelessly brandishing the prophet's head. This dream sequence, notably filmed in color, indicates just how accepted the adolescent model of a prurient princess had become as 1890s nocturnal seduction gave way to 1920s colorful daydream. Yet, instead of inserting this apt remnant of the actress's film credits in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> for Desmond and Gillis to watch, Wilder chose to show close-ups of a chastened but unrepentant Swanson in her eponymous role for <span style="font-style:italic;">Queen Kelly</span> .<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>
	    Regardless of the reasons for bypassing Swanson's youthful Salome, Wilder's own montage in filming <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> accomplishes something far more revealing. His sequence of Desmond undergoing her invasive beautifying renovation, scenes he had to t Brackett to include, puts in stark relief Norma's own wishful and willful transformation--that of restoring her youthful looks, the capital that formed the basis  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of her career and stardom.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> Instead of the enthrallment of her pubescent predecessors, the film shows "a merciless series of treatments" as Desmond gets "ready," Gillis jeers, "for those cameras that would never turn."<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> More than the bodily constrictions Bara and Nazimova withstood, Norma's renovative regimen, shot as a sequence, acts as the perverse mechanical reversal of a youthful Salome's enthralled dance of the seven veils. This mature "princess aspirant" endures a suffocating veiling of face and body rather than an unveiling of desire in the throes of a hypnotic dance.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> Wilder's montage of this self-inflicted ordeal recalls fashion photographer Horst P. Horst's nightmarish photograph "Electric Dreams"  that displays a woman with her body also swathed and her face similarly hidden under a claustrophobic mask. Seated under an electric hairdryer surrounded by the all-too-recognizable instruments of modern beautification, Horst's model sinisterly references that other cutting-edge technology, the electric chair, an evocation that renders Desmond's modern enthrallment a barbarous and lethal entrapment in contrast to the second birth that Stanley Hall had christened the arrival of adolescence. Wilder's sequence dramatizes, in effect, Norma's obsession with the cult of adolescence and her willing submission to the torment, potentially fatal, of cosmetic defacement, to restore her former youthful allure. Such defacement, it is hardly necessary to add, has since become standard medical and cosmetological therapies practiced on old and young alike. Thus, in contrast to the aesthetics of looking with which Wilde so radicalized <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, we have its opposite in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>.

	    emerging from her boudoir with her face still partly bandaged, hides from Joe. "I don't want you to see me," she gravely tells him.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> In capsule, Wilder's montage proposes that which in late modernity had become the destructive correlative of the enthralled sexual initiation of our fin de siecle ingenues. Instead of tempting and thrilling object, Desmond is made a freak, though one of culture, not of nature.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Although exulting early on over the silent-film era of her youthful success--"We didn't need dialogue. We had <span style="font-style:italic;">faces</span>"--Desmond nonetheless recognizes the exigencies of her commodification, the pound of flesh that the film industry exacts from its celebrities when she tells Gillis flatly, "I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me."<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> Even so, she completely misjudges her ability to sell herself as she also misinterprets DeMille's greeting her on set. What Desmond assumes is his interest in shooting her screenplay turns out to be a prop manager's interest in leasing her antique automobile for a Bing Crosby comedy. In this modern Babylon, Desmond's Isotta-Fraschini is the coveted object. Refurbished to its original mint condition, her Italian-made luxury car is the precious article, not the actress. Desmond's insufficiency as a star commodity lies in her inability to reconstitute the capital that was her youth. If fin de siecle Salome relied on a dynamic and hedonistic vibrancy, diagnosed by the social sciences as adolescence, then <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> exposes its embodied and material opposite, senescence (aged subjects) on one hand, and obsolescence (outmoded objects) on the other. And Norma Desmond at fifty is both senescent <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> obsolete: overage actress and has-been film star. Wilder's film reverses Wilde's play in the extreme. Whereas the prophet Jokanaan is put off because the precocious Salome's desires are deemed outre for a naive princess, the desired lover Gillis (the Jokanaan proxy) as well as the patronizing DeMille (the Herod proxy) are put off by Desmond's advances because she is too old and too dated for such adolescent fantasies.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Gillis, the film's truth-telling prophet, makes her mania clear as he packs to leave the mansion in their final scene: "Norma, grow up," he scolds. "You're a woman of fifty. There's nothing tragic about being fifty--not unless you try to be twenty-five."<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> This wisdom imparted by a twenty-five-year-old hireling would be ironic enough on its own, but it also happens to invoke the same incongruity that the young Graham Robertson first observed of Wilde's Salome in 1892, with a now rather glaring difference--for all intents and purposes the incongruity had become a theatrical <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> cultural commonplace. For trying to be a twenty-five or fourteen-year-old princess is precisely what mature actresses had been attempting in the almost sixty years since <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> fin de siecle premiere. Desmond's desire to play the pubescent Salome is in actuality no different from Bernhardt's, Munte's, Allan's, Bara's, or Nazimova's--and no less incongruous. In fact, when these actresses sought the role of Wilde's over-excited naif, they were closer in age to a fifty-year-old Norma Desmond than they were to a fourteen-year-old princess. And as these celebrities went, so went the women off-stage and off-camera who imitated them, signifying the extent to which generalized woman had come to rely on the adolescent model promoted by the Salome industry and passed off as Salomania. The one-act drama Wilde had envisioned in merging schoolgirl and seductress had become by the mid-twentieth century a modern woman's reality and,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Wilder's film, her tragedy. With a culture enamored with adolescence, the only curative, as Desmond attempts, is in hazardous beauty regimens that tout a return to the adolescent state of the alluring Salome. Outside the limits of adolescence, Wilder's film implies, woman has little value; only within its limits can she participate in the dream world that is film's signature haunt.

<p>
	    At the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, a deranged Norma Desmond, in what she believes is her cue for Salome's seductive dance, descends the mansion's stairway, with the cameras rolling to capture her apprehension for murder rather than her starring role. The fantasy of stardom persists, but as the madness of a middle-age actress. "And I promise you I'll never desert you again," she ecstatically gushes to the reporters and news cameramen recording her descent, "because after <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, we'll make another picture, and another and another. You see, this is my life. It always will be. There's nothing else."<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a> But even as we recognize the poverty of her self-delusion, we can also recognize its truth. For what is also singular in Wilder's stark vision is that Norma Desmond does not die. Unlike Wilde's drama, Wilder's Salome is not put to death before the cameras. In lieu of execution, Wilder gives us something more darkly redolent, the spectacle of her arrest. Desmond exemplifies Andre Bazin's notion of "embalmed time," as she consigns her reality as living person--"There's nothing else"--over to her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> celluloid image.<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a> Under Wilder's direction, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> reveals the sinister side of the apparatus of adolescence and, therein, the film's and the director's own complicity in mechanically and prolifically reproducing one beautiful young Salome and her aspiring lookalikes after another, all the while holding in their thrall the trumped-up adulation, the mania if you will, of the entranced generation on either side.<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Granting that I am being selective in the evidence assembled here, let me nonetheless propose that Wilde's incongruous melding of schoolgirl and seductress in 1892, thought comical by Robertson, and Wilder's dramatization of that fatal merger in 1950, now conceived as tragic, indicate that adolescence had not only become prolonged over the course of the preceding century as it became naturalized. But also, given the perks that adolescence ostensibly confers--vitality, sexual potency, beauty, independence, heightened consciousness, pleasure, and attention--it had come to attract the likes of middle-age actresses from the <span style="font-style:italic;">tragedienne</span> Bernhardt to a tragic Norma Desmond. If all are fated to enter adolescence, as Hall had theorized, then it seems equally the case that increasingly no one wanted to leave it. Adolescence comes to be valued for its own sake. Modern culture bears this out: the young can't wait to enter it and the old contrive never to quit it. Adolescence is not just chronic as Hall's work implied, but has become the default subject position of late modernity--a social construct and cultural space that progressively enlists more and more conscripts, presented in this essay as a generalizable woman, to its effervescent and hedonic fold.

		Though Pigott imposed the ban based on a proscription against dramatizing biblical events in force for three centuries, he seems most offended by Salome's overt sexuality, as he confided in a private letter to Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, Comptroller of Lord Chamberlain's Office: "[L]ove turns to fury because John will not let [Salome] kiss him <span style="font-style:italic;">in the mouth</span>--and in the last scene, where she brings in his head--if you please--on a 'charger'--she <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> kiss his mouth, in a paroxysm of sexual despair.

See, for example, Zagona on Stephane Mallarme's <span style="font-style:italic;">Herodiade</span> with its chaste Salome, imagined first as a drama but ultimately published as a poem in 1898 (<span style="font-style:italic;">Legend of Salome</span>, 41-68).

		It remains unclear when and how Wilde imagined a performance of Salome's dance of the seven veils, but it is undeniable that the addition of "seven veils" made his earlier inscription of a generic "dance" more vivid and exotic. Wilde apparently made the alteration sometime in the summer of 1892, just after rehearsals were shut down and while he was preparing <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> for publication. His handwritten changes in French appear penciled in proofs of the first edition. <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome Drame En Un Acte</span>, July[?] 1892, Oscar Wilde and his Literary Circle Collection, W6721M2 S171, The William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, UCLA. See also Rodney Shewan, "The Artist and Dancer in Three Symbolist <span style="font-style:italic;">Salomes</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">Bucknell Review</span> 30 : 124. Wilde's additions have led to much speculation over their impetus, whether arising from the staging of the play and his collaborations with Bernhardt and Robertson or whether from its publication and the help he received with his French from Marcel Schwob, Pierre Louyes, Adolphe Rette, and Stuart Merrill. Moreover, considerable debate remains over the cultural source of the seven veils, whether owing to the myth of Isis or of Ishtar. See, respectively, Jess Sully, "Narcissistic Princess, Rejected Lover, Veiled Priestess, Virtuous Virgin: How Oscar Wilde Imagined Salome," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wildean: A Journal of Oscar Wilde Studies</span> 25 (July 2004): 16-33; and Megan Becker-Leckrone, "Salome(c): The Fetishization of a Textual Corpus," <span style="font-style:italic;">New Literary History</span> 26, no. 2 (Spring 1995): 242-47.

		Sigmund Freud, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria</span> [1905] (New York: Collier, 1963). Richard A. Kaye observes a similar correlation between Salome and Dora, though his larger point importantly connects Salome to Benjamin's unease over the potency of the youth ethos informing Jugendstil aesthetics. Still, I take his implicit point that Wilde's Salome necessarily arises from the Victorian conception of childhood, a point central to Philippe Aries' <span style="font-style:italic;">Centuries of Childhood</span> as quoted in <a name="f29-text" href="#f29">note 29</a> below.

		To grasp the categorical shift adolescence presented in the late nineteenth century, we have only to contrast it with its precursor, "youth," which as the historian John Gillis has usefully noted lacked the differentiation in the pre-industrial age later accorded adolescence. According to Gillis, the modernization of youth resulted from the changes in class and education brought on by the political experiments of the late eighteenth century and manifested in urbanization and industrialization. See John Gillis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Youth and History: Tradition and Change in European Age Relations, 1770-Present</span> (New York: Academic Press, 1974), 5, 37.

	      According to Hall, "for those prophetic souls interested in the future of our race and desirous of advancing it, the field of adolescence is the quarry in which they must seek to find both goal and means. If such a higher stage is ever added to our race, it will not be by increments at any later plateau of adult life, but it will come by increased development of the adolescent stage, which is the bud of promise for the race" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 1:50).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>
	      Hall's bias toward women and the people he terms primitives is illustrated in the very structure of the study, with the topics of "adolescent girls" and "adolescent races" occupying the final two chapters of the two-volume study--in all, 187 of 1,337 pages. There is no corresponding chapter on "adolescent boys" or "advanced races." Of the "adolescent races," he observes that "[m]ost savages in most respects are children, or, because of sexual maturity, more properly, adolescents of adult size," with adult-sized adolescents offering a fitting terminus for his work overall (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 2:649).

		Daniel Brown and more recently Petra Dierkes-Thrun have importantly concerned themselves with showing the modernist implications of Wilde's transgressive aesthetics, Brown astutely connecting them to Billy Wilder's film. <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> functions as signpost and conduit of an aesthetic renovation that facilitates what Dierkes-Thrun calls "an ecstatic new realm for modern individualism and transformed secular humanism."

	      As Brown points out, the preliminary draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> has Desmond writing memoirs that some pages later become, without explanation, a story about <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> ("Wilde and Wilder," 1217). See File copy of the script of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, 21 December 1948 Typescript, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> file, Margaret Herrick Library, Beverly Hills, CA. Charles Brackett records in his diary only that he, Wilder, and Marshman were at work in January 1949 on what Desmond was writing, See Brackett, "Diary," 10 January 1949, 1949 Typescript, Margaret Herrick Library. By the 19 March 1949 script, Desmond is plainly writing the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>. See Draft script of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, 21 March 1949, Typescript. <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> file, Margaret Herrick Library. While it is unclear who had the idea of Salome, there is evidence that it was Wilder. Gene D. Phillips points out that Wilder knew Richard Strauss having scored a coup as a young journalist with his interview of the composer in 1925. Gene D. Phillips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder</span> (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, c. 2010), 4. According to Charlotte Chandler, Wilder, in writing the script, "played Richard Strauss's 'Dance of the Seven Veils' as inspiration." See Charlotte Chandler, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nobody's Perfect: A Personal Biography</span> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002), 159. And in rehearsal of Swanson's final scene descending the staircase, the director insisted on having Strauss's "Dance of the Seven Veils" playing for effect. See Ed Sikov, <span style="font-style:italic;">On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder</span> (New York: Hyperion, 1998), 300.

	      Lucy Fischer, in her perceptive treatment of age in the film, notes that the actress, "in her cinematic incarnation" stands in for "both the archetypal woman and the exemplary woman in film," thus making more jarring Swanson's "perverse portrayal" of an aging star in contrast to her merely eccentric former director Max (98, 102, 104). I differ, however, with Fischer's use of female vampirism, relying instead on its relation to rebellious young women and vamping. Fischer also connects Desmond's predicament to the prostitute or <span style="font-style:italic;">hetaira</span> class in which, citing Simone de Beauvoir, the body and personality represent the star's capital that is then exploited . While there is no denying the age-old connection between acting and prostitution, with Kirsten Pullen's recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Actresses and Whores</span> offering excellent case studies on the subject, my aim is rather to show how and with what consequences the conception of modern sexuality relates to the recent formation of the category of adolescence, with a focus in this essay on women. See Lucy Fischer, "<span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>: Fading Stars," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women and Film</span>, ed. Janet Todd (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1988), 97-113; and Kirsten Pullen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Actresses and Whores: On Stage and in Society</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).

	    Wilder and Brackett did not insist on the same verisimilitude in casting the twenty-five-year-old Gillis role. When Hollywood sensation Montgomery Cliff, then thirty, turned down the part, they considered such actors as Alan Ladd, John Garfield, Burt Lancaster, and Richard Widmark, none of whom was in his twenties (Brackett, "Diary," March 10, 1949). Under contract to Paramount, Holden, then thirty-one, was eventually ordered to take the role (Zolotow, <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy Wilder</span>, 161-64). Concerns that he looked too old to play a mid-twenties Gillis led Wilder and Brackett to propose adding make-up to age Swanson, a corrective the actress hotly resisted (Staggs, <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span>, 62).
	  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f75" href="#f75-text">75. </a>
	    That Wilder, so meticulous otherwise in his documentation, overlooked the obvious connection between the real Swanson's silent-film credits and the make-believe Desmond's credits is truly odd. One can only surmise that he considered a clip of Queen Kelly a far more glamorous fantasy of the silent screen era than a clip from <span style="font-style:italic;">Stage Struck</span>, a film that reduced the tragic Salome to every home-town girl's daydream: that of a wholesome naif waiting tables at a blue-collar diner in the boondocks.
	  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f76" href="#f76-text">76. </a>
	    In order to include the montage, Wilder had to overrule the conservative Brackett who complained of its grotesquerie, one of the quarrels that likely precipitated Wilder's ending their partnership on completing the film (Phillips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Like It Wilder</span>, 119).

	      While Grayson Cooke notices "a conflict between the temporality of life as it is lived and experienced, and the atemporality of the commodity image," there is more to the conflict than can be captured by Desmond's face alone via Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "faciality." It involves what it means to be a modern woman. See Cooke, "'We Had Faces Then': <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> and the Sense of the Spectral," <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review of Film and Video</span> 26, no. 2 (March 2009): 94-99.

	      I am indebted to Fischer's application of Bazin's term for, as she insightfully observes, Desmond, in contrast to Dorian Gray, "is haunted by a screen image that refuses to grow old" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>," 107). See Bazin, "The Ontology of the Photographic Image," in <span style="font-style:italic;">What Is Cinema</span>, trans. Hugh Gray, 2 vols. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 1:14.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f84" href="#f84-text">84. </a>
	    That Wilder's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> represents this reproduction as both mechanical and generational makes its vision even more prophetic than Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film of generational rivalry, <span style="font-style:italic;">All About Eve</span>, released the same year and starring Bette Davis, who, as an aging stage actress, must face the loss of career and celebrity when challenged by a cunning ingenue impersonating her.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
