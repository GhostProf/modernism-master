I find it hard not to see this event as an inversion of the story of the
three little pigs: here the three of us huff
and puff to blow down the house of the big bad wolf. This pig thought he
had a clever way to accomplish that. If I
could agree entirely with Walter Benn Michaels there would be no remainder
that his brilliant dialectics might subsume:
his house would stand but have no visitors. But despite my deep admiration
for his intricate arguments and my reluctant
concessions to his accounts of cultural pluralism and nativist modernism,
I cannot agree with the historical dimensions
of Michaels's argument. Even if one grants that there is a nativist
modernism, I doubt that it had the clear general
dominance that Michaels seems to be arguing for most of the time. And,
more important, I think his attributing such a
single synthetic identity across various cultural domains ignores the
various efforts to negotiate complex tensions
among value systems that are for me the central, dynamic features of
modernity. So I will have to make a few historical
claims and then try to explain what I find problematic in the theoretical
assumptions that seem to underlie Michaels's
argument.

<P>
Let me elaborate my complaint about his claims for the dominance of
nativist modernism by briefly addressing two
issues: first, problems in the scope of his claims and, second, problems
in how he deals with the agency of authors in
his efforts to establish that scope. On scope, consider the following
passage:


<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Johnson Act guaranteed that aliens would not become citizens by
putting a halt to mass immigration; the Citizenship
Act guaranteed that Indians would not become citizens by declaring that
they already were citizens. Both acts, that is,
participated in a recasting of American citizenship, changing it from a
status that could be achieved through one's own
actions (immigrating, becoming "civilized," getting "naturalized") to a
status that could better be understood as
inherited. [<I>OA,</I> 32]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A series of brilliant leaps here establishes a forceful account of how
ideas of citizenship changed for some agents.
But what about those who were not immigrants, and hence who already
experienced citizenship as inherited even (or
especially) during ages of heavy immigration? Conversely, what about those
immigrants who had received citizenship, or
whose children had heard stories about that process? Would they now shift
their understanding? And how much in common
really is there between the groups of immigrants and American Indians,
since they held quite different understandings
of what citizenship did and did not afford in economic and cultural terms?
Moreover, the very effort to establish
commonness on the level of what these pieces of legislation meant for
people requires overlooking the economic factors
that are central in establishing different experiences of
citizenship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 So as we pull at the threads of such
assertions we find neat equations unravelling into problematic
equivocations, and we begin to appreciate how many
factors an analysis of general attitudes toward citizenship might have to
account for.

<P>
Such omissions become more troubling when we turn to Michaels's dealings
with specific authors. He is superb in showing
how William Carlos Williams and Hart Crane enter into a discourse of
nativist modernism quite different from the
transnational modernism maintained by exiles like Ezra Pound and T. S.
Eliot. But I wonder how much these writers
ultimately share with the overall political concerns Michaels foregrounds.
If, for example, Williams insists that to be
"'Indianlike' the writer must make no likeness to Indians, he must devote
himself to 'WRITING'" (<I>OA,</I> 85), then
it seems that Williams's nativism is of a distinctly metaphoric kind, more
involved with the republic of letters than
with actual citizenship. To insist on the politics of his metaphors is not
far from calling for a feline modernism on
the basis of the analogies Williams draws between cats and the artist's
constructive intelligence. Michaels could only
be convincing here if he could show that Williams based specific political
decisions on identifications with the
natives he uses so blithely in his analogies. More important, Michaels
argues that texts can "parody but also
reproduce" (<I>OA,</I> 26) nativist attitudes, but he does not go on to
explore the aspects within the culture that
generate the distance necessary for parody. So he can use Jason Compson's
speeches as illustrations of William
Faulkner's dependency on racialist rhetoric (<I>OA,</I> 9). But in so
doing he ignores Faulkner's need to distance
himself from anything Compson-like (precisely because the author knows how
much he is tempted to such identifications).
Faulkner's own stance on race is probably closer to a tragic or Calvinist
inversion of progressivist racism that
becomes evident in the necessary deaths of Joe Christmas and Charles Bon,
as well as of Quentin Compson. Moreover, even
if I am wrong about Faulkner's specific beliefs, the gulf between Faulkner
and his characters


<B></B>


requires us to
postulate within modernist culture more than one attitude toward these
racial matters so that one can foreground the
tensions from which these doublings emerge.

<P>
Where conflict and uncertainty should be, Michaels doggedly and
brilliantly imposes a single dominant set of beliefs.
From my perspective the greatest cost is the resulting picture of
modernism. It simply does not suffice to equate
modernist styles with the purity of the signifier without also tracing the
ways that the artists and painters sought to
make this emphasis on syntax carry various versions of semantic force.
Think how often Williams speaks of realization
and of bearing cultural testimony, and recall the power of his lineation
to transform perception into C&eacute;zannian
realization by embodying the role of mental energies in the emergence of
sharp phenomenological detail. Similarly, when
Michaels links his claims about purity of the signifier to the ideal of
untranslatability, he ignores the degree to
which untranslatability functioned within modernism simply as a way of
opposing not impurity but discursivity. Indeed,
an impure art like collage might provide the best version of
untranslatability because of the diversity it forced into
conjunction. Finally, we have to recognize the profound impurities that
make it misleading to treat the literature of
the period in terms of simple dichotomies between native and universal.
Much of the energy driving the Harlem
Renaissance emerged from the pressure of having to face fundamental
conflicts between the ideals of a writing
distinctive to race and of a writing that explored cultural resources not
available to strict identifications with
nativist values.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And while Williams insisted on the primacy of
the local (often as access to a universal),
even his most radical claims about American identity are accompanied by
statements about the need to use the kind of
singularity that artworks achieve to break down differences and weaken
partiality. So when Williams describes, as
Michaels puts it, "the success of a poem" as consisting in "its
achievement of identity" (<I>OA,</I> 83), he is in
entire sympathy with Pound's transnational modernist dreams that the
achieved identity of artworks can establish
energies then available for diverse cultural groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
Given Michaels's intricate mind, I have to risk being patronizing in order
to speculate on what theoretical assumptions
underlie his case; then I can try alternative ways of addressing the same
concerns, which here I will confine to
concepts of identity and of cultural heritage. As long as he is concerned
with transnational modernism, Michaels seems
to have no problem dealing with fluid identities and allowing claims about
culture to do work even though they are not
attached to race. But when he turns to the domestic American scene, the
standards seem to shift. Here his project of
"work[ing] out the meaning of the commitment to identity--linguistic,
national, cultural, racial" (<I>OA,</I>
3)--common to both the social and the aesthetic models of nativist
modernism depends on Michaels showing that such
commitments are inherently flawed by a version of what Kenneth Burke
called "the paradox of substance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

There is a basic contradiction "between being something and trying to be
the thing one is" (<I>OA,</I> 90), so that
concepts of racial and cultural identity compose a


<B></B>


slippery circuit
in which each supplements and empties the
other. Problematic notions of identity then seem inseparable from
problematic notions of cultural heritage: "For racial
identity to become a project, it must turn to culture; for cultural
identity to become a project it must turn to race"
(<I>OA,</I> 122; for fuller statement see 14-15).

<P>
In short, such identity-commitments lead to the dead end of contemporary
cultural pluralism. But are these the only
ways to think about identity--either as a basic practical concern or as a
specific theme in modernist thinking? If we
are to have a less thematizable history and a more intricate sense of how
agents encounter and deal with cultural
pressures, we have to explore both historical and theoretical ways of
negotiating identity claims that do not depend on
the ontological substrates responsible for the slippage so dear to
Michaels's heart. Suppose for example that claims
about personal identity can function as projections that take place on
many levels. Identity is not a condition that
need apply <I>tout court</I> in ways that require a language of grounding
substance. Rather, identity claims wield that
marvelous adjusting operator "as," and hence are relative to contextual
frames. Therefore assertions of identity have
varying degrees of comprehensiveness depending on the scope of
self-reference called for by the situation--my identity
as a tennis player may be more intense than my identity as a family man,
but it still addresses a much smaller set of
features of my life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
Once our sense of identity claims is reconred, we can then see how one
might provide an alternative to Michaels's
treatment of claims about cultural heritage. He sees these as at best
misleading, at worst as charlatanry because for
him such claims have to depend on attributions of shared substance for
those who belong to the culture, and hence they
sustain racism:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
The real question, however, is not which past should count as ours but why
<I>any </I>past should count as ours.
Virtually all the events and actions that we study did not happen to us
and were not done by us. In this sense, the
history we study is never our own; it is always the history of people who
were in some respects like us and in other
respects different. When, however, we claim it as ours, we commit
ourselves to the ontology of "the Negro," to the
identity of "we" and "they" and the primacy of race.
<BR>
<BR>
This is not to say . . . that all accounts of cultural identity
require a racial component, it is only to say
that the accounts of cultural identity that do any work require a racial
component. For insofar as our culture remains
nothing more than what we do and believe, it is impotently descriptive.
The fact, in other words, that something
belongs to our culture cannot count as a motive for our doing it since, if
it <I>does </I>belong to our culture, we
<I>already </I>do it and if we don't do it (if we've stopped or haven't
yet started doing it), it doesn't belong to our
culture. (It makes no sense, for example, to claim that we shouldn't teach
Shakespeare because he isn't part of our
culture since to teach him will immediately <I>make </I>him part of our
culture, but it also makes no sense to claim
that we should teach him because he is part of our culture since, if we
stop teaching him, he won't be any longer.)
[<I>OA,</I> 128]

<P>
If, however, one has a more supple view of both identity and the kinds of
pressures that ideals of a cultural heritage
can help negotiate, one need not be as fearful as


<B></B>


Michaels is of the
illusions of substance creeping in. There are
other ways to speculate on which history ought to be ours, ways that do
not generate a strict binary between something
belonging to our culture only because we do it and some netherworld of our
forgettings. To dramatize this alternative
we need only ask whether Michaels's version of culture will suffice for
the many first-person plurals invoked in the
passage just quoted. Can the "we" here do any work despite not alluding to
race? And must "our culture" here depend on
actual shared practices, or only on understanding what such practices
might look like, even if we do not now actualize
them? I suggest that the "we" invoked here does not depend on any specific
set of shared beliefs but only on shareable
competencies. That is so, I further contend, because a cultural heritage
makes better sense when viewed not as actual
concrete practices that are either present or absent, but as complex
grammatical competence: the ability to use certain
practices and make certain identifications and assertions of difference
when occasions call for them. And then the test
of belonging to the culture is not sharing any origin but being able to
share the kind of projections Michaels invites
us to take on. Sharing a cultural heritage does not necessarily mean
reading Shakespeare but it does mean understanding
the reasoning involved in making a case for reading Shakespeare. One might
even say that so long as we teach literature
or drama there are claims that anyone whose interests are directed toward
such materials will profit from trying
Shakespeare--not because there is some direct link to him but because
there are possible uses for him that emerge from
our grasp of related materials and the interests they may form. So there
are considerable grounds for inviting or even
requiring people to try out identifications with a heritage even if there
is no racial basis for the identification.
Culture as educational heritage belongs to us, in other words, not because
we have direct rights to it but because we
can visualize sufficient proximity to its projections that we can believe
we have some interests in trying on what it
offers.

<P>
For American modernism, shifting our theoretical terms also involves
shifting the level of issues we make central and
the range of sympathies we entertain--for example in relation to how
agents like Coolidge might have been using notions
of culture very differently from how Michaels reads them (<I>OA,</I> 35,
123) and in relation to appreciating why there
could have been such tension between universalist and particularist
stances on matters of race and culture. Moreover,
understanding that ideals of culture as <I>paideia</I> offered an
alternative to racial and class identifications seems
to me necessary to appreciate both how the children of immigrants were
educated into American and how at least many of
the intellectuals found grounds for breaking with the religious and family
ties that originally bound immigrant
communities. The parents' concern with getting educated in order to get
ahead made possible the children's concern for
education in order to get away.

<P>
An adequate sense of history also requires a sense of how we might alter
what we inherit. Acutely aware of this task,
Michaels tries to make visible both the lineage and the contradictory
structure of cultural pluralism. But for me the
ultimate limitation of the theoretical assumptions enabling his work is
their incapacity to be much help


<B></B>


in
suggesting any alternative practical strategies for reconring our
imaginations in relation to racial issues. For
Michaels's pragmatism this theoretical poverty is no weakness at all: in
theoretical poverty there may be existential
possibility. However, I do not see how productive possibility will emerge
from the binary in his work between
problematic strict notions of identity and some general sense that we can
do without the notion of identity entirely
(even though Michaels's own history seems driven by quite narrow
categories). In my view, the best way to counter the
heritage of nativist modernism is not to absolutize it and then demolish
it but to use the conflicts and tensions its
formation created in order to clarify just how complex identity issues
are, and just what moral and social work can be
done if one keeps a relativized sense of how identity claims are both
imposed and negotiated. Then we need not dismiss
the possible need for racial identifications, so long as we can also
promise corollary identifications with imaginative
sites not necessarily bound to any specific racial heritage. So long as
race remains a term validated by historical
patterns, there will have to be projections of imaginative ways for
identifying with others who feel they share or are
required to share similar histories. Developing these possible
imaginations is the work of culture. But once we
understand the relation between culture and identity we also have strong
grounds for arguing that it is as impoverished
to rely only on racial identifications as it is to deny by abstract
argument that they ought to matter for historical
practice.

There is one particular moment in <I>Our America</I> where this refusalof
economic factors in favor of cultural
concerns seems especially problematic. Michaels professes to find no merit
in the charge that whites have stolen
aspects of black culture, since there is no clear way to decide what makes
certain elements black or white:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But why does white men's learning to sing and dance like blacks count as
stealing black culture? The assumption that
transforms learning into stealing must be that blacks have a <I>right
</I>to their culture that is violated by whites
who take up black cultural practices. Or, to look at it from the other
perspective, that whites who sing and dance like
blacks are betraying <I>their </I>culture. But for either of these
descriptions to be true there must be some special
relation between race and culture such that racial identity counts as
importantly determining cultural identity, that
is, as determining the cultural practices that you have a right to if not
necessarily the cultural practices you in
fact engage in. [<I>OA, </I>129]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
However in the case of claims about popular music at least, the charge is
not made on the basis of some abstract sense
of cultural right. Rather it is a simple economic fact that music
producers sought whites to play songs and develop
sounds that were the province of specific black performers. And the
outrage is a matter of profits going to those who
take the work of others: the fact that the work is black is much less
important than that the workers were perceived as
black and because of that were not the ones white promoters developed.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT2" HREF="#REF2">2</a>.
Clearly poets like Countee Cullen would not accept the statement that"the
alternative to 'Nigger' . . . seems to be
'imitation white'" (<I>OA,</I> 90). And Michaels needs his best
equivocating skills to get Alain Locke's concern for
what Locke calls "Negro life's" "seizing upon its first chances for group
expression and self-determination" to be
incompatible with Locke's corollary insistence that it is "unjust" and
"ridiculous . . . to regard and treat the Negro
<I>en masse</I>" (<I>OA,</I> 88). Given Locke's pragmatism, there can be
infinite ways that one can call upon a racial
group without treating that group in terms of a single mass: all they need
have in common is the possibility of seizing
in the present on new possibilities of individual self-expression.

Conversely this model will also accommodate treatments of identity
as"something that might be lost or found,
defended or surrendered" (<I>OA,</I> 141), since an utterance like "I am
Duchess of Malfi still" can be treated as a
taking of responsibility, not a discovery of something hidden. I use this
example to suggest also that it is
historically inaccurate to blame nativist modernism for making identity
into "an object of cathexis" (<I>OA,</I> 141),
since from the Renaissance to Hegel's beautiful soul such staking of the
self has been fundamental to Western drama,
and not only on stage. For a defense of the claims I make here see my
<I>Subjective Agency</I> (Oxford: Blackwell,
1994).
