<h1 class="sec-headA">Modernism and Memory Crisis</h1>
<p>
	Speaking at a conference in Rome in 1961, the Syrian modernist poet Adonis launched a famous and famously intemperate attack on traditionalism in Arabic poetry and poetry criticism. His talk, entitled “al-Shi‘r al-‘arabī wa mushkilat al-tajdīd” [Arabic Poetry and the Problem of Renewal], began by reviewing the classical tradition of literary criticism. Critics of the ‘Abbasid era (c.750–1250), Adonis argued, had only ever sought to inhibit poetic creativity, setting themselves up as guardians of tradition and obstacles to renewal: “The critics defended inherited values [<span style="font-style:italic;">qiyam mawrūtha</span>] and clung to the ancient, exalting it because it was ancient, even when it was ridiculous.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Adonis went on to assert that the traditionalism espoused by these critics had not diminished with the passage of centuries, but rather had become stronger: “The understanding of poetry that dominated our past with all the force of tradition [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-taqlīd</span>] continues into our present with the same force. Indeed, it has grown in acuteness and complexity.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> For modern poets to free themselves from this powerful and creeping sclerosis, they would have to undertake radical measures. It was in this spirit that Adonis announced a “revolt against the traditionalist mentality.”
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Renewal cannot be accomplished by reverting to tradition or by adapting to its poetic conventions, for such a reversion would mean a separation from the present, a shackling of sensibility, a betrayal of reality.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Poetry, he declared at the end of his talk, reaching for the rhetorical heights, was “an act of salvation and liberation” [<span style="font-style:italic;">khalāṣ wa taḥarrur</span>].<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Stephen Spender, one of the respondents to Adonis’s paper, must have heard echoes of his youth in all this (translated echoes, so to speak). But he wondered if Adonis hadn’t overstated the case. T. S. Eliot, Spender reminded the audience, had been both a modernist and a traditionalist. Perhaps the Syrian poet, with all his talk of “revolt,” had been reading too much Rimbaud? Spender ended his brief remarks—according to the Arabic transcription, which is the only one that survives—by reproaching Adonis for his “complete disregard of the ancient heritage [<span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>] of Arabic poetry,” and calling his paper “extremist in its demolition of poetic traditions [<span style="font-style:italic;">mutaṭarrifa fī taḥṭīm al-taqālīd al-shi‘rīya</span>].”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The exchange between Adonis and Spender evokes several of modernism’s familiar and apparently insoluble contradictions: heritage versus modernity, rupture versus continuity, the revolutionary <span style="font-style:italic;">Jetzseit</span> versus the long <span style="font-style:italic;">durée</span> of tradition. While Adonis argues that a reversion to the classical heritage would entail “a separation from the present,” Spender counters that a dismissal of this heritage leads to a separation from one’s own cultural past. Backwardness or inauthenticity, here are the two equally intolerable options that confront so many modernisms of underdevelopment, which experience these contradictions with especial sharpness.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is perhaps because their choice is an impossible one—a choice between two kinds of alienation, we might say—that these modernisms so often employ a rhetoric of crisis, a mode of self-articulation that is frequently extravagant and even melodramatic.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is this excessiveness or “extremism” that Spender objects to explicitly. But while Spender accuses Adonis of chasing after the new and foreign at the expense of the inherited past, other readers have accused him of doing precisely the opposite, claiming that his version of modernism is only a kind of covert pastism, a classicizing movement that calls itself revolutionary. So the Moroccan critic, Abdullah Laroui, in his seminal essay, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis of the Arab Intellectual</span> , lumps Arab modernists together with their European confreres—he mentions Eliot, Pound, and St. John Perse—“all of whom are exponents of tradition and order, and who take as models and foundations of the ‘poetic’ the attitudes and works of the classicizing periods.” Laroui argues that the modernity of these poets merely “consists in their recombining of transmitted culture according to a conscious and unvarying code (poetic technique).” “Now,” he asks rhetorically, “have all the ‘modernists’ of Arab poetry, from Abū Nuwās to Adonis, done differently?”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
	I will argue that Arabic poetic modernism offers neither a flight from the past, nor a flight into the past; neither a mimicry of Western models, nor a mimicry of classical techniques. Rather, what Arabic modernism offers is a series of imaginary, or formal solutions to the crisis of modernity. The form I will look at closely here is the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>, and more specifically Adonis’s monumental <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān al-shi‘r al-‘arabī</span> [Anthology of Arabic Poetry], a three volume work published in Beirut between 1964–1968.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> By calling this work a “formal” solution to the crisis of modernity, I do not mean that it was merely formal (nor that the solution it proposed was finally effective). I am not opposing form to history. On the contrary, I want to show that Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is a complex, situated  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> response to a historical crisis whose contradictions are crystallized in the work’s various levels of argument and allegory. It is because the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> recognizes and articulates these contradictions so masterfully that it is able to hold out the imaginary, or ideological satisfactions of their resolution. Confronted by a memory crisis in the present, I argue that Adonis’s anthology offers the elegiac pleasures of the poetic, now constructed as an autonomous institution. The interlocking parts of this project—narrative, ideological and editorial—combine to a make the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> a remarkably integrated form of Arabic modernism, an artifact that illuminates its surrounding historical strata.
      </p>
<p>
	Each volume of Adonis’s anthology is provided with a lengthy narrative introduction. Let me begin my reading with a citation from the opening section of the first volume, which attempts to conceptualize the entire project as well as to specify its historical motives:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  This poetic museum [<span style="font-style:italic;">hadhā al-matḥaf al-shi‘rī</span>] aids in the reconsideration of poetry as the original creative force in Arab life. For poetry’s role in the present has begun to recede from the level of its authentic mission [<span style="font-style:italic;">risālati-hi al-aṣlīya</span>] in the life of Arabs. This phenomenon is a crisis [<span style="font-style:italic;">azma</span>]. We must to recognize it. Whether the causes of this crisis are political or religious, or traceable to the nature of our historical stage, none of this allows us to turn our attention or studies away from it.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The crisis named here is a crisis of cultural transmission, or translation. It involves the difficulty, perhaps the impossibility, of handing down a certain heritage [<span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>] or mission [<span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span>: message, epistle] from generation to generation. Later on in his introduction, Adonis laments the fact that “the rising generations” are no longer interested in Arabic poetry “because the mentalities and methods that transmitted it [<span style="font-style:italic;">naqalat-hu</span>: translated it] to them could not see in poetry farther than the syntax, meter, and topoi that were mutually agreed upon, and the norms that had been generally sanctioned.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The crisis would thus seem to spring, at least in part, from a fatal institutionalization of tradition, a scholastic rigidity in the understanding of its conventions. What had once been an authentic part of Arab life, entrusted with a mission—“<span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span>” is a word with inescapably religious overtones, suggesting a rivalry between poet and prophet (<span style="font-style:italic;">rasūl</span>)—has now degenerated into a series of codified gestures. Poetry has become a schoolboy’s exercise.
      </p>
<p>
	But the problem of institutionalization is rather different from the one Adonis began with, which was a crisis of cultural transmission. Indeed, the institutionalization of poetry would seem to be less a corollary of this crisis than a possible solution, since the survival of poetry appears guaranteed rather than threatened by its inclusion in a curriculum. The subtleties of Adonis’s argument come into focus around the re of the “museum” [<span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span>], a word he uses more than once as a metaphor for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> itself. It is an odd re to have chosen. For it seems, at first blush, to emphasize the values of conservation and preservation over those echt modernist slogans of revolution and innovation. It identifies modernism with an oddly antiquarian practice: the cataloguing of the potsherds of culture and then their arrangement for display (but already we see how apt the metaphor is for describing the work of an anthologist). If  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the crisis confronting poetry is that its <span style="font-style:italic;">risāla</span> in Arab life has begun to recede, then it is not easy to see how placing poetry in a museum counts as a solution, since a museum is precisely where we put the art of the past to rest. As Adorno has noted, “Museums are like the family sepulchers of works of art. They testify to the neutralization of culture.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The museum as sepulcher, or mausoleum, is an unlikely site for the transmission of poetry’s mission. But Adonis clearly has a different ideal of the museum in mind, perhaps something more like what Zukofsky, describing Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, termed “a living museum of facts.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This museum would be an institution that does not testify to the neutralization of culture so much as its activation, renewal, or indeed resurrection.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As Adonis writes in the next paragraph, now in an overtly Neitzschean idiom: “This heritage museum [<span style="font-style:italic;">hadhā al-matḥaf al-turāthī</span>] strengthens our faith, we who believe in the necessity of transformation and the generation of new values, against those who cling to the culture [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ladhīna yatamassakūna bi-l-turāth</span>] literally, repeatedly and coercively.” The establishment of a heritage museum, in other words, is not an act of “clinging to heritage,”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> but rather an attempt to set the heritage free from itself.
      </p>
<p>
	Before attempting to analyze the several elements of Adonis’s argument, it will be useful to zoom out and away from his essay in order to provide a wider, indeed international context for its polemic and formal strategies. This means shifting our attention away from the vehicle of Adonis’s metaphor (<span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span>) to its tenor (<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>), which I have provisionally translated as “anthology.” In the first two sections of this essay, I will argue that the project of anthologization is central to the practice of Arabic modernism as a late and underdeveloped modernism. I attempt to show how the construction of a <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> was critical to its historiographical ambitions as well as its ideological program of aesthetic autonomy. I begin by noting that the anthology has been mostly overlooked by students of modernism, who typically concentrate on its more clamorous cousin, the manifesto. My goal is not to minimize the importance of that form, which has been crucial to so many modernist and avant-gardist projects in their efforts dramatize a break with the art of the past. Rather, I try to show how the anthology has performed a complementary, melancholic function, which is the rewriting or “re-citation” of literary history in the form of an archive (another possible translation of “<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>”).
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> vs. <span style="font-style:italic;">Bayān</span>: Anthology as Re-Writing</h1>
<p>
	Scholars of modernism have mostly ignored the anthology, focusing their attention instead on the more attention-grabbing genre of the manifesto.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> It is an understandable bias. The manifesto’s importance is attested to in the long history of modernist and avant-gardist texts, from Marinetti to the Situationists, passing by way of Pound, Lewis, and Breton. Martin Puchner, in his recent, erudite study of this history, argues that the manifesto is uniquely suited to negotiate “the specific temporality of modernity, a temporality of breaks and new beginnings that nevertheless continue to be confronted with a past that can never be abandoned for good.” This temporality, Puchner claims, “appears nowhere as succinctly and strikingly as in the genre of the manifesto.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> A similar prejudice in favor of the manifesto is observable among critics of Arabic modernism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as well, who have also theorized the <span style="font-style:italic;">bayān</span> (manifesto) as being particularly well equipped to navigate the crises of the present. So the Tunisian critic Muḥammad Luṭfī al-Yūsufī, in his introduction to the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Bayānāt</span> [Manifestos], gives a characteristically heroic description of the genre: “The manifesto is a moment of danger [<span style="font-style:italic;">laḥẓa khaṭira</span>] that puts us in the presence of a form of writing [<span style="font-style:italic;">namṭ al-kitāba</span>] beginning to be formed, a genre that storms over all boundaries” (al-Yūsufī is specifically concerned with the boundary between narrative and poetry).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Typical here is the attribution of performative urgency. The manifesto does not merely respond to “a moment of danger,” but is itself such a moment. It is a genre of writing that promises to violently reshuffle all accepted literary categories and temporalities.
      </p>
<p>
	The corpus of modernist anthologies is, however, at least as extensive as that of the manifesto and in fact both stem from the same author. Filippo Marinetti published the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">I poeti futuristi</span> in 1912, three years after his better known <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifesto</span>. The anthology is reported to have sold 35,000 copies in Italy and included, opposite its cover page, Marinetti’s “Direzione del Movimento Futurista,” an institutional flow chart that included directorates for “Poesia,” “Pittura,” and “Musica.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Anglo-American modernists were aware of Marinetti’s collection and the genre’s popularity during what Chris Baldick has termed “the great age of anthologies” is due in part to this inaugural effort.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The anthologies edited by Pound are legion, from the early collections, <span style="font-style:italic;">Des Imagistes</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Anthology</span> , up through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Active Anthology</span>  and including Chinese translations such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Classic Anthology Defined by Confucius</span> . In Spain, the importance of Gerardo Diego’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología Poética En honor de Góngora</span> , a collection that re-introduced Góngora to modernist poets, is well known.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> (This tradition was later extended, and eventually globalized, by the prose anthologies of Borges, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología de la literatura fantástica</span> , as well as his later self-anthologizations <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología personal</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nueva antología personal</span> , not to speak of his various “<span style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotecas</span>.”) In France we might mention Breton’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthologie de l’humour noir</span> , which attempted to archive a particularly “modern” sensibility of the comic. Stretching the concept, we might even suggest that the Brazilian modernist Oswald de Andraje’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifesto Antropófago</span> , with its call for the incorporation of foreign works into the body of Brazilian culture—ultimately to digest and so transform them—articulates an anthological program at the level of modernist culture as a whole. This brief list, which might easily be extended, suggests that the form is indeed endemic to modernist practice, and also indicates some points for comparison and differentiation with the Arabic experience.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It would be foolish to suppose that the anthology fulfills an identical function in these various national situations. But it is worth suggesting a common denominator to these disparate efforts, even if that commonality must be interrogated in turn to reveal local motives of each particular case. The pervasiveness of the anthology, I will argue, points to its effectiveness in accomplishing a necessary task of modernism—and one not well suited to the more theatrical genre of the manifesto—which is the re-writing of literary history.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	This characteristically melancholic exercise, an apparently impotent or unproductive brooding over the fragments of tradition, is especially obvious in anthologies such  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as those edited by Breton, Diego, or Adonis, which include some poetry of the past. In these works, poetic history is re-narrativized in the form of a collage. The texts of tradition, collected in the form of citations, are rearranged in new patterns, effecting what Frederic Jameson has called modernism’s “powerful displacement of previous narrative paradigms.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> A typical, if somewhat crude example of such displacement is Diego’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Antología poética en honor de Góngora,</span> a florilegium published in Madrid on the three hundredth anniversary of the Spanish poet’s death. The volume gathers a series of poems that display a common “magnetic attraction” toward the baroque master. <a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Arranged in strict chronological order, the poems are either dedicated explicitly to Góngora or written in imitation of his style. “<span style="font-style:italic;">Es casi una antología al revés</span>,” Diego explains, “<span style="font-style:italic;">la que busca en los autores, no su personel estilo en autónoma plenitud, sino su filiación y genealogía trabada hacia un antepasado, cuya atracción malogra en cierto modo su más genuina calidad</span>.” The benefit of such an “inside-out” anthology is that its depersonalized, genealogical narrative allows Diego to suggest that the <span style="font-style:italic;">el Góngorismo</span> is a modernist substratum, or core sample—“<span style="font-style:italic;">Este homenaje representa como un corte transversal en la geología de nuestra corteza poética durante tres siglos de evolución</span>,” he writes<span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>whose re-discovery in the present has the power to reshape the entire landscape of Spanish poetry.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> And so it is hardly by chance that the last two poems of the anthology are Don Jose Iglesias de la Casa’s “Letrilla,” published in 1793, and then Rubén Darío’s “Trebol” published in 1905. In this way, the blandly curatorial collecting and organizing of poems becomes a polemic against the nineteenth century—“<span style="font-style:italic;">el peor que ha conocido nuestra poesía</span>,” Diego remarks—though it does so negatively, by way of a displacement or repression. Diego’s anthology succeeds in rewriting, via citation, the history of Spanish poetry as one with a modernist <span style="font-style:italic;">telos</span>, here represented by the re and corpus of Darío.
      </p>
<p>
	We can find a more complex version of this narrative strategy, one marked by its own characteristic repressions, displacements, and reshufflings, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> of Adonis. I want to explore this narrative in some detail (since it has not been studied elsewhere, and is rather intricate) before inquiring after its ideological significance.
      </p>
<p>
	The three volumes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are arranged in chronological order, according to a well-established scheme of Arabic literary history. The first volume consists of excerpts from pre-Islamic (<span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span>) poets and the poets contemporaneous with Muhammad’s revelation (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-mukhaḍramūn</span>). The second volume includes poets from the eighth to eleventh century, the “golden era” of Abbasid rule. The last volume is dedicated to the nearly nine hundred year long decline [<span style="font-style:italic;">inḥiṭāṭ</span>], characterized by a poetry of “mere craft and artifice.” The last period ends, roughly, with the poetry of Khalīl Gibrān. For each volume Adonis wrote a lengthy introduction, the analyses of which are closely recapitulated in his 1971 book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Muqaddima lil-shi‘r al-‘arabī</span>..
      </p>
<p>
	The essay that introduces the first volume describes the ethos of pre-Islamic poetry. Adonis takes a famous phrase from the seventh-century poet, Tamīm bin Muqbil, to be paradigmatic: “Were that man was a stone” [<span style="font-style:italic;">law anna al-fatā ḥajr</span>]. It is a pithy condensation of what Adonis describes as a melancholic heroism at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> sensibility: the poet’s knowledge of life’s brevity and his obsessive desire to overcome it, even at  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the price of petrification.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The world of these early poets is absolutely profane: no Gods or spirits populate the wadis, and the poet “possesses nothing but the earth.” But the earth, which is in fact nothing but the desert, is essentially indifferent to the poet’s plight. It has no lessons to teach and no comfort to offer. Confronted by an impassive nature, or the mute ruins of an abandoned campsite (<span style="font-style:italic;">aṭlāl</span>), the poet’s typical response is a brash fatalism or stoic <span style="font-style:italic;">élan</span>. It is this sensibility that we find careening through the poetry itself. For Adonis, the pre-Islamic <span style="font-style:italic;">qaṣīda</span> is a kind of quest romance in which the hero “goes outside of his self in order to find himself”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  [Bin Muqbil’s phrase] reveals . . . a yearning for mastery over frailty and death. Discovering himself, the Arabic poet also discovers the absurdity of the world upon which, nevertheless, his destiny depends. So his self develops in a split oneness [<span style="font-style:italic;">wiḥda muzdawija</span>]: there is no link between the self and what it contemplates, and the more it contemplates, the greater its realization of the abyss that separates it from the world. When man’s separation from the things that surround him becomes clear, his own deficiency is also clarified, leading to a thirst for a completion that cannot be achieved except in the exterior world.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	So the poet’s coming-to-consciousness is inextricably bound up with consciousness-as- death. In Adonis’s telling, the pre-Islamic poet-hero discovers over and over again that nature is nothing more than a trap for his imagination. It is this extravagant will-to-timelessness that connects all genres of <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> poetry: just as the lyric poet of the <span style="font-style:italic;">qasīda</span> wants to become a stone in order to master time, so the ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">ūdhrī</span> love poet wants time (i.e., his night with the beloved) to freeze in place, to become a moment of permanent ecstasy.
      </p>
<p>
	The introductory essay to the second volume of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, which includes poetry from the eighth to eleventh centuries, postulates a decisive shift in the historical situation, which is the move from the nomadic life of the desert to the settled life of the towns. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">fourmillante cité</span> of ‘Abbasid Baghdad the poet is confronted not by an indifferent nature, but by an undifferentiated human mass that threatens to overwhelm him. Instead of embarking on an outwardly-directed quest, the poet therefore retreats into himself, spiritualizing nature and making it a reflection of his inner vision. Baghdad is where the poet discovers alienation and irony: “Feelings of alienation [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ghurba</span>] and disconnection from others—of being ‘an echo of life,’ as Abū Tammām expresses it—this is the sap that courses through the experience of Abī Nuwās, Abī Tammām, al-Mutanabbī and Abī al-‘Alā’ [al-Ma ‘arrī] . . . These feelings of alienation and disconnection are the context and motive for irony [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-sukhrīya</span>].”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Irony is, for Adonis, the master trope of ‘Abbasid poetry. It bears witness to the poet’s radical break with the urban crowd that impinges upon him, with the “other” that has become his “enemy.” At a stylistic level, this dissociation is signaled by the poet’s penchant for obscurity [<span style="font-style:italic;">alghum ūḍ</span>] and hermeticism. Adonis cites a famous anecdote from al-Ṣūlī’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Akhbār Abī Tammām</span>, in which the poet is asked by one of the uncomprehending masses, “Why do you not say that which is understood?” To which the poet haughtily responds, “Why do you not understand that which is said?” ‘Abbasid poetry is the result of this dialectic of interiorization and alienation: radically set off from his environment, the poet discovers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the self as an origin of the world: “He will choose alienation,” Adonīs writes of al-Mutanabbī, “believing that there is no greatness except in himself.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	This summary of Adonis’s narrative suggests how ingeniously he rewrites a conventional literary-historical narrative of pre-Islamic and ‘Abbasid poets in a manner that reproduces the categories of Romantic and Modernist (specifically, <span style="font-style:italic;">symboliste</span>) poetry. In the first period, the <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span>-Romantic era, the heroic imagination pits itself against an exteriorized nature in a sequence of quest adventures. In the second, the poet of Baghdad/Paris retreats into an interior world of analogies and symbols, whose impenetrability is a function of the poet’s estrangement from and superiority to the urban masses. Adonis’s rewriting thus serves as a sort of narrative <span style="font-style:italic;">trompe l’oeil</span>, making it seem as though Arabic modernism preceded by eleven centuries the French version on which it is clearly modeled. And in case the reader missed the point of this rewriting, Adonis asserts, in a comparison that has become notorious, that Abū Tammām, the most difficult and <span style="font-style:italic;">recherché</span> of all the classical poets, was the “Mallarmé of the Arabs,” and that Abū Nuwās, a libertine famous for his wine poetry, was the “Baudelaire of the Arabs.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Joseph Massad, one of the few critics who has written perceptively about the dilemmas of periodization in modern Arabic philosophy and historiography, notes that Adonis’s comparison “anachronistically render[s] Europe, not Arab-Islamic civilization, the reference.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> But it is probably more correct to say that the reference is not so much Europe, or the West, as “modernism” itself, whose temporality is more complex than the idea of anachronism can account for. By inserting the French model of <span style="font-style:italic;">symbolisme</span> into the Arabic tradition itself—by depositing it, one could say, into the archive of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology—</span>Adonis res his <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> as a kind of crypt, whose opening promises the shivery pleasure of something new (“modernism”) that was always-already there. The crypt, or museum, is indeed where poetry is conjured back to life. This uncanny kind of pleasure is also, I will argue, a elegiac one—a structure of feeling that points to the belatedness of Arabic modernism as a historical experience. And it is this belatedness that Adonis’s re of the <span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf</span> captures so well. It suggests a modernism that has not only already occurred, but one that has already been “institutionalized” (which is to say, theorized). In the last portion of this essay, we will look at how this theorization bears specifically on the editorial as opposed to narrative strategies of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>. But first we must ask what institution of modernism is at stake here, and attempt to sketch its historical coordinates.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Autonomy of the Aesthetic</h1>
<p>
	Classical tradition links the first <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> of Arabic poetry to reasons of state.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> According to one such tradition, it was the first Ummayad Caliph, Mu‘āwiya [d.680], who ordered the transmitters of verse, the court <span style="font-style:italic;">ruwāt</span>, to select a collection of exemplary poems—the so-called “Hanging Odes” (<span style="font-style:italic;">mu‘allaqāt</span>)—for his son to study in written form. A similar anecdote is told of a subsequent Ummayad Caliph, ‘Abd al-Malik [d.705]. This educational rite seems to have been transmitted across the change of dynasties. According to a later medieval tradition, it was the ‘Abbasid Caliph al-Manṣūr who  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> commanded the celebrated Kufan philologist al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḍabbī [d.780] to collect poems by lesser-known poets and teach them to his son, the future Caliph al-Mahdī. The resultant anthology, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mufaḍḍaliyāt</span>, was perhaps the most celebrated of all the early Arabic anthologies. In addition to providing a myth of royal <span style="font-style:italic;">bildung</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">adab</span>, this anecdotal tradition also narrates the transition from orality to literacy, from a poetic culture based upon the memorization of poems to one in which they are archived in written form.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> This transition, which inevitably recalls the Platonic mythology of the <span style="font-style:italic;">pharmakon</span>, obeys a similarly supplementary logic. In order to ensure the dynastic continuity of state and the transmission of culture from generation to generation, the caliph has recourse to the technology of writing. But this new art of memory, while preserving the traces of oral culture, also signifies the end of that culture and its own special techniques of memorialization. There is also a pleasing etymological wit to these narratives, since one common derivation of <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> is from the Arabic <span style="font-style:italic;">dawwana—</span>to collect, write down, or register—while another would return us to the Persian <span style="font-style:italic;">deve</span> (‘mad,’ ‘devil’), used to describe secretaries or state functionaries.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Later narratives of cultural transition or translation, including that of modernism, return obsessively to this primal scene and rewrite it in a variety of idioms. We have already seen how Adonis’s narrative of literary history, from <span style="font-style:italic;">jāhilī</span> to ‘Abbasid poetry, allegorizes this same transition as a move from desert to the city, which sets the stage for the emergence of an urbanized Arabic modernism in the streets of eighth century Baghdad. A later stage of the narrative promises the renewal or rebirth [<span style="font-style:italic;">iḥyā’</span>] of that cultural moment in the pages of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, now red as a <span style="font-style:italic;">matḥaf turāthī</span> [heritage museum], an institution whose supplementary logic should be clear. But it is now time to specify Arabic modernism’s own historical situation, as well as its peculiar “institutional” ideology, an ideology that distinguishes its allegorical operations from all previous and subsequent programs of rewriting.
      </p>
<p>
	This ideology is in fact the familiar modernist doctrine of aesthetic autonomy.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> I am not interested in rehashing debates about this ideology <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>. Instead, I want to examine its modalities and functions in a concrete case. Briefly, my argument in this section is that Arabic modernism, as an ideology of autonomization, attempts to differentiate itself from the institution of the post-colonial state [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>]—whose allegorical signifier for Adonis is “the caliphate”—and thereby secure direct, unmediated access to the modern.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Paradoxically, this access was sought via another mediating institution, which is the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> itself, now red as a cryptic site of putting-to-death and bringing-to-life. This contradiction of “mediated immediacy” sets in motion a process of differentiation within the institution of modernism itself, forcing it to differentiate itself not only from the state, but also from its rival ideologies. At a limit-point in this process, the institution of modernism is finally identified with that empty, purely ideological signifier, the individual subject (in Adonis’s terms, <span style="font-style:italic;">al-shakhṣ</span>).
      </p>
<p>
	It is because the role of the state and its cultural bureaucracy is so central to this argument that I began by recalling medieval anecdotal traditions about the new technology of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>, invented to ensure dynastic continuity at a moment of historical transition. These traditions—as well as another opposing series, concerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Ḥamāsa</span> of Abū Tammām, which I will mention at the end of this section—give us some coordinates for understanding Adonis’s conception of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> and its ideological function. Adonis argues, at the beginning of the introduction we have been reading, that his <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span> is intended to combat “a long-standing tradition” that has distorted the Arab reader’s relation to poetry:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  It is the tradition of politics, the state [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>], power struggles, and everything that accompanies them. This tradition still continues in one form or another and has greatly influenced a large portion of the rising generations. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology of Arabic Poetry</span> attempts an appeal to the heritage itself, immediately [<span style="font-style:italic;">bi-ṣūra mubāshira</span>], in order to disseminate beauty and poetry as these things were understood by the Arab poet, far from Caliph or Tribe, and to show that it is incorrect to delimit poetic work according to its political or creedal content. Nor it is possible to judge that work by political standards. This anthology consists of poetry that serves no school, creed, state or person. And for all that it is, itself, our poetic glory.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	We will see in the last section of this chapter how Adonis’s severing of the poet’s ties to caliph and tribe affects the editorial principles of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>. For now, we will take this passage as Adonis’s initial attempt to theorize a doctrine of aesthetic autonomy and poetry’s relation, or lack of relation, to <span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span>.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Adonis gives the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> a strikingly different function from the one it is given in the medieval anecdotes. Rather than ensuring the continuity of the state by transmitting cultural heritage from father to son, Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is meant to interrupt that dynastic tradition and unloose the ties that bind institutions of state to those of culture. This interruption, decentering the state vis-à-vis the poet, who now stands in splendid isolation, makes possible a direct relation to “the heritage itself ” (even though this heritage, as we saw in the preceding section, has already been rewritten in the idiom of modernism). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> is thus red an institution of pure mediality, facilitating a link, but not interposing itself, between the reader and poetry, between the reader and poet. To conceive of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> in this way is to pretend that the whole editorial apparatus—its methods of selection, exclusion, reduction and rearrangement, as well as the prefatory material of the “Introductions” themselves—has no mediating role. It is to pretend that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s relation to the poetic heritage is a natural relation rather than an institutional one.
      </p>
<p>
	To represent a mediate relation as though it were an immediate one is, of course, the very definition of ideology, and I now want to sketch out the historical coordinates that made such an ideology possible and plausible. I will do so by drawing a necessarily schematic contrast between the national situations of Egypt and Lebanon between the years 1955–1975, which I take to be the period of poetic modernism.
      </p>
<p>
	In the Middle East, the characteristic development of this era was the centralization of power in the hands of the post-colonial state, typically under the auspices of socialist, or quasi-socialist, single-party regimes. This process of centralization was in one sense the continuation of Ottoman and colonial era policies, emphasizing a series of reforms that provided the state with increased powers of policing, led to the formalization of legal systems, and sought to incorporate religious institutions and offices into the civilian  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> apparatus. But the post-colonial era witnessed an acceleration of this centralizing tendency, giving the state vastly greater abilities to penetrate and shape the social fabric.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> The end point of this period (c.1975) coincides with the onset of so-called “correction” or “rectification.” The specifics of these policies varied from state to state, but in general they signaled the integration of heretofore protected national economies into the global market. While these programs did not always shrink the state, or force it to withdraw from the social, they did tend to fragment and internationalize the organs of economic decision-making, giving rise to new institutional actors, whether public (WTO, World Bank), or private (a new financial elite).
      </p>
<p>
	It was Egypt, following the Free Officers Coup of 1952, that enacted the most comprehensive program of centralization and provided a model to other states in the region. As a country with well-established administrative structures stretching back to reign of Muhammad Ali, Egypt was the first regime to undertake a program of land reform, systematic nationalizations, and armed force modernization. Other states in the region implemented their own versions of these policies, often at the instigation of Egypt, which encouraged state expansion in Syria during the three years of union (1958–61), and also in Iraq between 1963–64, when the two countries were also contemplating union in the wake of a coup by Nasserite officers. The drive toward centralization also extended into the cultural realm. In Egypt, the state was gradually able to assert what Anouar Abdel- Malek has termed “un monopole d’Etat virtuel sur la culture.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Richard Jacquemond, in an especially valuable study of relations between writers and state in Egypt, has given a more detailed, institutional history of how this monopoly was achieved:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  C’est à partir de 1956 que le régime nassérien, sorti renforcé de l’épreuve de Suez, met en place le système d’institutions par lequel il va s’assurer le contrôle et la mobilisation des intellectuels, système qui pour l’essentiel est encore en place. Création du Conseil supérieur des arts et des letters , du ministère de la Culture , expansion des institutions étatiques préexistants (dans le théâter ou la radiodiffusion), création de nouveaux organismes (la télévision en 1960), nationalisation de l’ensemble de la presse en 1960, du cinéma en 1961, d’une part importante de l’édition entre 1961 et 1965 . . . En somme, l’Etat des Officiers libres prolongeait une tradition ancienne de protection et de contrôle des artistes et intellectuels qu’il ne fit à la limite que systématiser.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	By multiplying its organs and extending their powers ever deeper into the social realm, the Egyptian state was gradually able to establish itself as sole mediating institution between Egyptian society and modernity.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The state’s “virtual monopoly” over the field of culture was a practical monopoly over the discourse of the modern. This explains why <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>, for Egyptian intellectuals during this period, has little or nothing to with the aesthetic autonomy championed by Adonis and his modernist movement. In Egypt, neither modernism nor modernity could be convincingly imagined outside the institution of the state.
      </p>
<p>
	The situation in Lebanon generally, and Beirut in particular, was different. Independence from France was achieved in 1947 with hardly any violence. The country’s merchant and banking elite had put aside sectarian differences long enough to shake  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hands on the National Pact of 1943, an unwritten agreement that formalized clientism as the law of the land. This same elite consistently opposed any measures of state centralization. <a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> A parliamentary system of inter-confessional bargaining was maintained in tandem with a politics of notables. Because the power of the elite depended on their ability to satisfy the needs of their followers personally, they rejected any attempt by the state to interpose its own administration and resources. Lebanon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">laissez-faire</span> economic policy was confirmed by its repeal of the Customs Union with Syria in 1950, and Beirut soon began to serve as an entrepôt between European and American markets and the newly oil-rich Gulf.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> The subsequent influx of international capital into Beirut was accompanied by a parallel influx of exiles and emigrés. Oppositional intellectuals from neighboring states took advantage of Lebanon’s porous borders and many political exiles, including Adonis, fled to Beirut in the early 1950s.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The city was a seemingly civil oasis in a region of hypertrophied states. In Beirut, intellectual and political projects could thus assert their autonomy from <span style="font-style:italic;">al-dawla</span> and hope to set up a direct, unmediated link with <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Arabic modernism’s particular version of aesthetic autonomy, i.e., of institutional differentiation from the state, helps to explain one last feature of Adonis’s introductory narrative, which is his critique of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa.</span> The <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> (“revival,” “awakening,” “renaissance”) is a broad historical term referring to the various nineteenth century movements of intellectual reform that arose in response to the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The “shock” of this encounter with the West is typically supposed to have roused the Arab world from its dogmatic slumbers and thrust it violently into modernity. The problem posed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> to Arab modernists is thus similar, in some respects, to the problem posed by Romanticism to European modernists. In both cases, a movement fueled by innovation is confronted by a precursor movement of the previous century, whose claims to a practice of rupture, even when announced in an idiom of reform or revival, appear equally urgent as their own. In the case of Arabic modernism, a specifically Lebanese phenomenon, this agon was aggravated by the fact that the historical center of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> was Egypt. Egyptian intellectuals were the first to undertake translations of European technical and artistic works, from Fénélon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Télémaque</span> to Cruveilhier’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anatomie pathologique du corps humain</span>, in a manner that must have struck the modernists as all too reminiscent of their own project.
      </p>
<p>
	Modernism’s typical response to the difficulty posed by its Romantic or nahḍawist adversaries—a response that one might trace in the essays of T. S. Eliot, or Octavio Paz, as easily as in Adonis—is to undertake a process of internal differentiation, a movement of self-division and increasing specialization that allows modernism both to assert a continuity with the (re-written) past while distinguishing itself from rival precursors. In Adonis’s account, as we have seen, it is the tradition of Àbbasid poetry that is rewritten in a modernist idiom and then claimed for present purposes. At the same time, Adonis criticized Modernism’s chief rival, the (Egyptian) <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span>, for failing to wrest poetry free of its instrumentalization by the state—which, as we have seen, is the <span style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span> of modernism defined as an ideology of autonomization. As he writes in his introduction to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> did not offer, from our literary and poetic heritage, anything except works that vacillate between two tendencies: clichés and didactic parables on the one hand, and, on the other, politics and whatever is connected with it in the way of poems of praise and blame [<span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ wa hijā’</span>]. It did not provide us anything except works in which the individuality of the poet [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat al-shā‘ir</span>], his own views and experiences, does not come to the fore. Rather, what comes to the fore is the character of the society [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat al-mujtama‘a</span>]: its habits, traditions and established conventions. Works, in other words, that cannot possibly benefit a true poetic renaissance [<span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa sh‘irīya ḥaqqan</span>].<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	Let me further suggest that the poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span>, criticized here for their imbrication with politics, should be understood as allegorical res contemporary rivals. These rivals are the nationalist poets (many of them Nasserists and in that sense “Egyptian”), whose committed, political verse is hereby excluded from the realm of poetry.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> In this way, all possible positions in the contemporary field of Arab poetics, whether romantic, modernist, or nationalist/Marxist, are emplotted in Adonis’s narrative. Even the unarchived poetry of the present is, at least allegorically, accounted for.
      </p>
<p>
	It is the very comprehensiveness of this narrative, its urge to tally up and catalogue the entirety of poetic experience—an encyclopedic instinct that reaches its climax in the four volumes of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil—</span>that begs the question of modernism’s own institution. Separately from the state, or caliphate, how are we to imagine the archive, institution, or anthology (all possible translations for “<span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span>”) of the modern?
      </p>
<p>
	Still lingering with the passage cited above, I would suggest that we are asked to imagine this institution in the re of “the individuality of the poet” [<span style="font-style:italic;">shakhṣīyat alsh ā‘ir</span>]. We have seen how Adonis weans poetry, in the name of its autonomization, away from institution after institution, beginning with the tribe and caliphate and ending with the nation state. The re of the individual, <span style="font-style:italic;">al-shakhṣ</span>, is in this sense whatever is left over from modernism’s relentless process of differentiation. He is a re of <span style="font-style:italic;">difference</span> in the mathematical sense of the word: the result of a process of subtraction. The non-institutionalized subject is hollowed-out, purely abstract (no matter how one tries to fill it with “views and experiences”). This properly ideological re, a hero of modernism, is already hinted at in the notion of a poet who dwells far from Caliph or tribe and who provides the discerning reader with immediate access to the heritage that is <span style="font-style:italic;">al-ḥadātha</span>.
      </p>
<p>
	With this mention of the isolated poet, the visionary nomad or alienated urbanite, we return to the tradition of medieval anecdotes with which we began this section. Alongside those anecdotes that re the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> as a new technique of transmission and dynastic continuity there is another, complementary group of anecdotes, which cluster around two anthologies of the ‘Abbasid poet, Abū Tammām, “Mallarmé of the Arabs,” as Adonis calls him. Abū Tammām’s ninth century collection of pre-Islamic and early Islamic poetry, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān al-Ḥamāsa</span>, was medieval <span style="font-style:italic;">succès de scandale</span>. According to one count, it received at least thirty classical commentaries.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Adonis was well aware of Abū Tammām’s compilations. He names them specifically, at the beginning of his introduction, as the sole models for his own editorial efforts: “All the anthologies  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that preceded this one, with the exception of Abū Tammām’s s two <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>, were conventional. They only confirmed the reigning standards and common taste.” This assertion of continuity with the ‘Abbasid period, an assertion that leaps heroically over the intervening twelve centuries, is a typical and by now unsurprising gesture. But there are other reasons why Adonis might allude to Abū Tammām’s anthologies.
      </p>
<p>
	Here is a tradition related by the eleventh century critic Yaḥyāibn ‘Alī āl-Tibrīzī, given in the introduction to his commentary on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Abū Tammām was returning from Khurasān on his way back to Iraq when he came to Hamadhān. There, Abū al-Wafā’ ibn Salama availed himself of the opportunity to invite Abū Tammām to stay as his guest. It happened one day that there was a huge snowfall that cut off the roads making travel impossible. This distressed Abū Tammām but delighted Abū al-Wafā’, who said, ‘Make yourself at home here, for it will be a long time before the snow is cleared,’ and took him to his library. So Abū Tammām read and studied until, within the space of one month, he had compiled five books of poetry, among them the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Waḥshiyyāt</span>.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The image of Abū Tammām, cocooned in his friend’s library while a snowstorm rages over the Alvand range is a neat pendant to the cliché of the desert raider. In Adonis’s terms, it is a typically “modernist” image: the heroic quester has retired to the solitude of his study. But this bookish isolation points up an important difference with the previous series of anecdotes. For whereas earlier canonical anthologies were compiled at court, Abū Tammām is imagined here as composing his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> far from the institutional luxuries of Baghdad. The exaggeratedly marginal setting for the anecdote may be taken as a narrative explanation for the anthology’s famously innovative editorial methods, methods that would seem to depend more on the poet’s individual tastes than the conventions of philology. Rather than arranging the poems, as was customary, <span style="font-style:italic;">‘ala al-rijāl</span> (according to the poet), Abū Tammām’s anthology is arranged ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">ala al-abwāb</span> (by topoi), with sections devoted to fortitude in battle [ḥ<span style="font-style:italic;">amāsa</span>], elegy [<span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span>], love and the vituperation of women, among others. He ignored traditional principles such as chronology or tribal affiliation and juxtaposed poets of different eras and regions on the same page. Still more strangely, many poems are excerpted—the typical entry is only three to five lines long—their lines rearranged, and sometimes two different poems were combined into one.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Many commentators even suspected Abū Tammām of interpolating his own word choice where the poet’s seemed to him deficient. All these innovations point to a break with the philological probity of court transmitters like al-Mufaḍ ḍal al-Ḍabbī, who were anxious to preserve the original, oral version of a poem before it fell into oblivion. Abū Tammām, burrowing into the archive of his friend’s library, does not worry about the pathos of origins or oblivion. In a culture of writing, poetry can be rearranged, rewritten, and even re-attributed.
      </p>
<p>
	It is perhaps to this historical and technological transition that another eleventh century critic, Aḥmad Ibn Muḥammad al-Marzū qī, refers to when he suggests that, “If God brought them back to life, the poets [included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>] would perhaps follow Abū Tammām and submit to him”—i.e., they would submit to his editorial decisions.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> This brief eschatological fantasy of al-Marzūqī is one that would appeal to Adonis.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> It invites us to think of the anthology as a historical, or indeed divine tribunal. The poets of the past are resurrected—as in a sense they are, in the form of citations—and submit to the judgment of the living anthologist. It is the present that will judge the past, not according to a philological concept of authenticity, but rather according to the needs and standards of the moment. The poets of the yesterday will “follow” [<span style="font-style:italic;">yatba‘ūn</span>] the poet of today. This paradox suggests a very different notion of the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> than the one linking it to the dynastic institution of the state. In that version, the <span style="font-style:italic;">dīwān</span> worked to secure a continuity between past and present, oral and written, pre-Islamic and postrevelation, father and son. In the final section of this chapter, I show how Adonis’s conception of the anthologist is more like to the re sketched here by al-Marzū qī, a rewriter and resurrector of spirits, an elegiac tribunal of history.

<p>
	    In this final section I try to show how the various narrative and ideological arguments of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are translated into a series of editorial principles that are as radical as they are comprehensive. I argue that the rewriting of poetic <span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span> according to the ideology of aesthetic autonomy results in a particular economy of genres, one defined by its repressions fully as much its inclusions and innovations. The purpose of this exposition is two-fold. First, it seeks to show that the form of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān—</span>its narrative, ideological and editorial components—is a tightly structured whole, an integrity that I take to be symptomatic of modernism’s commitment to totality. The second purpose of the exposition is frankly revisionary. By emphasizing Adonis’s efforts as an editor or anthologist rather than as a poet, it seeks to complicate the usual, Promethean portrait of Adonis that critics have been repeating now for many years.
	  </p>
<p>
	    We have seen how a logic of differentiation leads Adonis finally to claim that the poet himself, the poet as a re of absolute isolation, is the origin and medium of poetry’s transmission. It is only by stripping away the mummy clothes of history and politics that the reader is put in contact with the poetic tradition as such. This tradition can only be transmitted by the efforts of poets who conduct their labors far away from the court or the state, whether in a private library in Hamadhān, or in the magazine culture of modernizing Beirut. So it is no surprise that this re is also taken as a kind of editorial compass point: “In selecting these poems,” Adonis writes, “I have followed the thread that links us to the character of the poet—to his worries, joys, pains and own individual life [<span style="font-style:italic;">ḥayāti-hi huwwa</span>]—without consideration for politics or reigning societal values: the thread that links us to the individual, not the society; to creativity, not history; to poetry, and not the topic [<span style="font-style:italic;">mawḍū‘</span>] of poetry.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    How does this individualist principle get translated into practical, editorial terms? What are the kinds of poems it selects for, and what kinds does it exclude? Adonis explains that it is chiefly a matter of genre:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      I must indicate that I am inclined to consider the poem of praise [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-madḥ</span>] and the poem of blame [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-hijā’</span>], as well as things similar or somehow connected to them, a part of our political and social history, not part of our poetic history. I do not evaluate poetry according to its topics. Rather, its value is determined by its manner of expression and the extent to which it complies with contemporary poetic values and with my understanding of poetry.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    This exclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> from a <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> that claims to represent the poetic heritage as such—whose criterion for inclusion is simply whether or not the poem is poetic—is why I call Adonis’s editorial principles radical. An enormous amount of the classical poetic corpus, perhaps the very core of it, from Ka‘ab bin Zuhayr’s “Banat Su‘ād” to al-Mutanabbī’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Sayfīyāt</span>, belongs to these two genres. Even in the relatively unorthodox case of Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span>, of the 261 selections there are eighty <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> poems and thirty-two <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span>, each of which has a separate chapter. The motive for Adonis’s exclusion, or repression, is clear: it is meant to purify the poetic tradition of politics (Adonis’s late modernist translation, perhaps, of the Mallarméan dictum, <span style="font-style:italic;">donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu</span>). And indeed, the volumes of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span> are strikingly devoid of <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span>. Even in the case of poems that do belong to these genres—Abū Tammām’s “Ode to Armorium,” for example, a praise poem for the caliph al-Mu‘taṣim—the sections of explicit praise have been edited out.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Before looking at what is left, what we might term the melancholic remnant, we should pause for a moment to consider the look of the poems on the page. In contrast to medieval or nineteenth-century anthologies, invariably equipped with a bulky apparatus of philological commentary, the pages of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> are remarkably clean. Vocalizations are kept to a minimum, there is no marginalia, no help given with difficult words, and no context provided for the occasion of the poem (the ancient critics often did supply a context, typically anecdotal or legendary). I take it that this way of constructing the page, a method of abstraction or subtraction, is a corollary of Adonis’s argument for poetic autonomy. That is, the exaggeratedly large blank spaces are allegories of the reader’s solitude: here, on the page, is where he or she confronts “the heritage itself.”
	  </p>
<p>
	    But what, finally, does this heritage consist of when stripped of its institutions, its historical occasions and cloak of philological commentary? My argument is that it consists of a poetics of melancholy. This is hinted at, first of all, from the fact that the elegy [<span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span>] is the only classical genre that survives in Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, a text that is strewn with elegies for sons, brothers, friends, and heroes. This <span style="font-style:italic;">survivance</span> is surprising enough, given modernism’s vigorous resistance to all generic conventions.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>’s own resistance to, or repression of genre (and not just those of <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">hijā’</span>) is otherwise implacable. Take, for example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>’s method of categorization. While the poems are arranged chronologically, by author, each individual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> poem or excerpt is given a thematic title by Adonis, none of which betray the genre to which the poem belongs: “Today and Yesterday,” “Woman,” “Confusion,” “Rain,” “Despair.” Among these renamed and rearranged fragments of the generic tradition, elegy subsists like some stubborn, unreconstructed truth, a remnant of the social that has not yet been broken down and reconred. The economy of genre is in this sense also an economy of repression, in which the repressed object—here, politics itself— becomes a motive for melancholy.
	  </p>
<p>
	    This is how I would name and explain the mood that is conjured up by the poems of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>. It is a mood whose subject is almost exclusively interested in passing things. The world of these poems is a world headed for extinction, or else it is already extinct. Here, for example, is one ninth century poet’s evocation of a rose: “A visitor, guiding himself to us each year, / A handsome face, chastely perfumed, an intimate of wine [<span style="font-style:italic;">ilf al-mudām</span>] / Fifty days old, he goes in peace” [‘Alī bin Jahm, d.863].<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> And in many cases the manifold of these poems—clouds, rain, women, settlements and cities—is only remembered, its sensual plenitude a function of its being past. “My eye quivered [<span style="font-style:italic;">ikhtalajat ‘aynī</span>] and then I saw him, as if my eye had knowledge of absent things” [Ibrāhīm bin al-‘Abbās al-Ṣūlī, d.861].<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> The incipient tear of grief brings a visionary clarity, a knowledge of hidden or invisible things. In this way the erotic nostalgia of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span>, in which the poet laments the beloved’s absence over the traces of her abandoned campsite, or the dry-eyed calm of the <span style="font-style:italic;">zuhd</span>, in which the ascetic counsels equanimity in the face of life’s brevity, merge into one structure of feeling. Under this Saturnine gaze, alternately tearful or stoic, the hieroglyphics of history are transformed into still lifes, a collection of <span style="font-style:italic;">memento morii</span>: “Why do the graves not answer when the melancholic [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ka‘īb</span>] calls out to them? / Holes roofed by stones and sand dunes, / Inside are parents, children, youths and old men. / So many lovers to whose parting my soul was unreconciled” [Abū al-’ Atāhiya, d.862].<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> In the introduction to his anthology, writing of the pre-Islamic poets, Adonis takes this structure of feeling as a guiding principle, what he calls “the awareness of fate” [ <span style="font-style:italic;">ḥiss al-dahr</span>]:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      What I mean by fate is an overwhelming power that one cannot t against. It takes away all things, transforms all things. Confronted by this power, the poet feels impotent and out-schemed. It is not the power of death, but a dynamic, leveling force that carries absence in its wake: absence of the beloved, of settlements, of relatives and the tribe . . . This explains the rooted melancholy [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-ka‘ āba al-mujadhdhara</span>] in the Arab spirit and in Arabic poetry. For the Arab, melancholy is an authentic, natural wellspring.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	    It is the skillfulness of Adonis’s editing that makes this claim so plausible, and if I insist again that the melancholy of this tradition is not in any sense natural or “authentic,” but rather an ideological projection, then my insistence should also be understood as an acknowledgement of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s suasive powers and imaginary satisfactions. Let me suggest one last way of registering this projection, what we might call an elegiac ideology, in an effort to gather some strands of my argument and round it off.
	  </p>
<p>
	    I have already noted the exemplary role played by Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> is Adonis’s conceptions of modernism, anthology, and the handing down (or interruption)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of tradition. Now I would suggest that one of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>’s most ambitious agendas is to rewrite the great ‘Abbasid poet, via citation, as an elegist. Abū Tammām is clearly at the center of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, not only as a model anthologist, but also as a poet: we are given 78 excerpts from his <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, second only to Abū Nūwās, who has 91 (al-Mutannabī has only 40). Adonis’s elegiac revision is ambitious, in the first place, because of Abū Tammām’s reputation as the greatest of the ‘Abbasid panegyrists. Most of these efforts are, as we might have expected, simply excluded from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>. A more subtle approach is taken with what is perhaps Abū Tammām’s most famous poem, his “Ode to Amorium,” a <span style="font-style:italic;">madḥ</span> that commemorates the caliph al-Mu‘taṣim’s sack of the Byzantine stronghold in 838. Adonis cites ten lines of the poem [11–12; 25–33], which are drawn from the poet’s description of the city before and after the Muslim armies attacked it and set it afire. The caliph’s victory over the city is red as a rape of its inhabitants (“For on that day the sun did rise upon no man but chaste, nor set upon a virgin”), and the last lines quoted by Adonis portray a scene of ruin:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The city in her ruins looked as lovely Mayy’s haunts, in their heyday to Ghaylan. Her cheek, though streaked with grime, appeared as tempting as cheeks aflush with maiden modesty</span>.
	    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Gazing on her disrement, no need had we of beauty or of pleasing sights</span>.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    The effect of Adonis’s editorializing is, I think, to make a poem written in praise of the caliph into an elegy for the city he has destroyed.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> With a typical melancholy flourish, the beauty of that city, red now as a woman, is only revealed in post-bellum retrospect. Our sense for the importance of elegy to Adonis’s revision of the ‘Abbasid poet is strengthened by the number of his explicit elegies that are excerpted, which amounts to one fifth of the total poems cited.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What is the effect of rewriting heritage in the idiom of elegy? This question returns us to the paradox with which I began, which is modernism’s attempt to hand down tradition in the mode of its interruption. I noted how this paradox, or memory crisis, was red in the “institution” of a museum, a cryptic site for both the putting-to-death and bringing-back-to-life of the work of art. In the elegist, we have another such re. For it is the institution, or genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">marthiya</span> that points both to impossibility of handing down the <span style="font-style:italic;">turāth</span>, as well as to its fitful life in the present. In Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, the heritage survives in the form of a citation, or ambiguous whisper. I will end by citing one of Adonis’s citations of Abū Tammām, a fragment that he titles “Elegy for a Son.” Here, in an uncanny scene of life-in-death and death-in-life, the poet elegizes what was to have been the future, but which is now falling indelibly into the past:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The last time I saw him, Death had thrown him low, prostrate with sickness. His choked plaints caught in his throat, his cries turning each around the other, Echoes that turned the tongue on itself. Death would not let him speak clearly. His eyes now turned fixedly upwards, his eyelids flickering closed.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>

		The stone is also a keyword in Adonis’s early poetry. Take, for example his three-line poem, “<span style="font-style:italic;">ḥajar</span>” [Stone], from <span style="font-style:italic;">Aghānī Mihyār al-Dimashqī</span>: “I worship this gentle stone [<span style="font-style:italic;">al-Ḥajar al-wādi‘a</span>]. / I see my face in its lineaments [<span style="font-style:italic;">taqāṭī‘i-hi</span>]. / I see in it my lost poetry [<span style="font-style:italic;">shi‘rī al-ḍā’i‘</span>].” “<span style="font-style:italic;">Wādi‘</span>” [“gentle”], in the first line, is an unexpected and suggestive word, since it also bears melancholic connotations of farewell (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-wadā‘</span>) and archival ones of deposition and storing (<span style="font-style:italic;">al-wad‘</span>). In the second line, the poet handles the stone as if it were a mirror, or a skull in which he witnesses his own fragmentation: <span style="font-style:italic;">taqāṭī‘i-hi‘ al-wajh</span> [lineaments of the face] is an idiom, but the singular <span style="font-style:italic;">taqā. ti‘</span> signifies interruption, fragmentation, discontinuity. All of these ambiguities resonate in the final line, in which the poet discovers that the verse he bid farewell to (or perhaps never wrote) has been inventoried or inscribed in the stone. The stone as an object of “worship” is in this sense a kind of profane fetish or melancholic emblem of a world without divinities, which is why it belongs equally to the pre-Islamic world of the <span style="font-style:italic;">jahilī</span> poets as well as the post-religious world of Mihyar.

	      The analogy between Baudelaire and Abū Nuwās occasions a further piece of ingenuity, when Adonis explicates the Arab poet’s occult theory of “<span style="font-style:italic;">tashābuhāt</span>” (similitudes, analogies) in a way that asks us to translate the word as “<span style="font-style:italic;">correspondences</span>.” See <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, vol. 2, 15.

		In this sense my invocation of modernism’s “institution” is very much in line with the analysis offered by Peter Bürger in <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), 1984. And following Bürger’s terminology, I would argue that Arabic modernism was not in fact an avant-gardist movement. It attempted to establish an institution, not to dismantle one, nor to sublimate art into life.

	      There are other moments in the text where Adonis is more declarative, e.g., “I have tried [in assembling this <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology</span>] to examine Arabic poetry purely in terms of its artistic value, which transcends the limits of time and space . . . Poetry acquires its ultimate value from itself [<span style="font-style:italic;">min dākhili-hi</span>], from a richness of experience and expressivity, not from outside, from what it reflects or expresses . . .

		The elite was also fortunate to inherit a relatively feeble colonial state. France, the poorer of the two European powers during the inter-war years, had run Lebanon on an especially tight budget. In the interests of economy, it left educational and medical needs to be provided on a communal basis. See Roger Owen, “The Political Economy of Grand Liban 1920–1970,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Essays of the Crisis in Lebanon</span>, ed. Roger Owen (London: Ithaca Press, 1976), 24–25.

		It is a commonplace to think of Lebanon as History’s perennial middle-man. In fact this is an invented tradition and can be traced to the writings of the Lebanese nationalist Michel Chiha—a banker, who also first coined the ideologeme of “the merchant republic.” On this point, see Michelle Hartman, “’The First Boat and the First Oar’: Inventions of Lebanon in the Writings of Michel Chiha,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Radical History Review</span>, no. 86 . It is true that Lebanon has for some time functioned as a node of trade rather than its origin or end, but the difference between serving as an intermediary between the silk producers of Syria and European markets, which was the primary use for Lebanese ports throughout the nineteenth century and up through the Great Depression, and serving as the intermediary between Gulf oil wells and American markets, as Beirut did after WWII, involves a paradigm shift rather than a smooth transition.

	      Others, of course, did not flee because they were put in jail. Here is perhaps the place to acknowledge that the history of modernism in Arabic literature—a literature produced, for the most part, outside the prison—is at all points shadowed by this other, more violent history, whose ideological and aesthetic coordinates have only begun to be charted.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f47" href="#f47-text">47. </a>
	      In this sense the institutions of Arabic modernism—in the form of an anthology like Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span>, or modernist magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Shi‘r</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mawāqif—</span>and the famous Palestinian “state within a state” are radically contemporary projects. Nor is it coincidental that both experiments were brought to term at roughly the same historical juncture, when the civil war exposed the contradictions of Lebanon’s era of <span style="font-style:italic;">convivencia</span>.

	      Adonis’s identification of Egyptian poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nahḍa</span> with a contemporary strain of political poetry is clear in Adonis’s chapter in on Samī al-Bārūdī’ in <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil</span> (vol. 4, 39–53). al-Bārūdī’ was the most prominent Egyptian poet of the nineteenth century and the editor of a celebrated anthology in his own right—the four volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Mukhtārāt al-Bārūdī</span>’, published in 1909—and therefore doubly a rival. In <span style="font-style:italic;">al-Thābit wa-l-mutaḥawwil</span> Adonis writes of al-Bārūdī’, dean of the <span style="font-style:italic;">naḥ da</span>: “There is no doubt al-Bārūdī”s poetry had a revivalist function, meaning that it was a technical revision of the past. And this revival may well have carried some political-patriotic significance, in the sense that it encouraged self-confidence and resolution in the face of the enemy, or in the struggle against him. So it might be said that al-Bārūdī’s poetry played a prominent role in the raising of national consciousness. But this role is not, technically speaking, poetic,”.

	      Adonis also admits to rearranging his lines: “I have not always maintained the succession of verses in the poem,” he writes at the end of his first introduction, “at times moving a verse forward,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and times dropping it back in order to establish the structure of the verses and sequence of thoughts.

		On this point, Jameson has written, “The reaction against genre theory in recent times is a strategic feature of what must be called <span style="font-style:italic;">the ideology of modernism</span>.” See his “Magic Narratives: Romance as Genre,” <span style="font-style:italic;">NLH 7</span> , 135. Muḥammed Luṭfī al-Yūsufī argues, in a more modernist vein, that the classical system of genres was itself a method for the “domestication” [<span style="font-style:italic;">tadjīn</span>] of poetry. See Muḥammad Luṭfī al-Yūsufī, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fitnat al-mutakhayyal</span> (Beirut: al-Mu’assasa al-<span style="font-style:italic;">‘</span>Arabīya lil-Dirāsāt wa-l-Nashr, 2002)., vol. 1, 226–27.

This trope of questioning the silent stones is another point of convergence between <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">zuhd</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rithā’</span>. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">nasīb</span> it is not the gravestones that are questioned, but the traces of the beloved’s camp, the <span style="font-style:italic;">ṣumm khawālid</span> [mute immortals] of Labīd’s <span style="font-style:italic;">mu‘allaqa</span>. Interestingly, a <span style="font-style:italic;">rithā’</span> that evokes this trope, Muatmmim bin Nuwayra’s elegy for his brother Mālik, is anthologized in both Abū Tammām’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ḥamāsa</span> (no. 265) and the first volume of Adonis’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Dīwān</span> . The poem has been commented on by Stetkyvetch (319–321), whose translation I use here: “My companion reproached me for weeping at the graves, for the flow of tears poured forth. / He said, ‘Do you weep at every grave you see for a grave that lies between al-Liwā and Dawānik?’ / I replied, ‘Grief evokes grief, so let me be, for every grave is a grave of Mālik.” On elegiac questioning in the Western tradition see Peter M. Sacks, <span style="font-style:italic;">The English Elegy: Studies in the Genre from Spenser to Yeats</span> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 21–23.
