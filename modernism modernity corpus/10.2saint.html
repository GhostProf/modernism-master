Then the plane began to move along the ground, bumping like a motorcycle,
and then slowly rose into the air. We headed almost straight east of
Paris, rising in the air as though we were sitting inside a boat that
was being lifted by some giant, and the ground began to flatten out
beneath us. It looked cut into brown squares, yellow squares, green
squares and big flat blotches of green where there was a forest. I began
to understand cubist painting.

<p>
The notion that cubist painting is intimately, even causally, connected
to aerial perspective has become a fixture in scholarly lore about both.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Such a connection has allowed art historians to posit yet another
  technological base or source for cubism's syntax of rupture, while
  celebrants of the aerial view and the aerial photograph invoke the same
  pairing to glamorize the vertical as avant-garde. It is a connection,
  moreover, whose authority is temptingly underwritten by several
  prominent contemporaries of cubism. In a 1921 essay introducing a
  cubist exhibition in Berlin, the critic Waldemar George wrote that
  "cubism is entirely based on the theory of equivalents: an equivalent
  for volume, an equivalent for aerial perspective, an equivalent for
  form. . . . It replaces aerial perspective by an equivalent for the
  third dimension."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Ernest Hemingway claimed to understand cubist painting in a new way
  when, during his second flight in an airplane, he peered down on
  the patchwork of fields and forests between Paris and the Vosges
  mountains. Descriptions of aerial vistas in Evelyn Waugh's novel
  <i>Vile Bodies</i>  draw on his

<b></b>

accounts of abstract paintings he had seen the previous year at the
Parisian <i>Panorama de l'art contemporain</i>.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Oftenest cited is Gertrude Stein's coupling of aerial perspective
  and cubism in the conclusion of <i>Picasso</i> :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But the earth seen from an airplane is something different. So the
twentieth century is not the same as the nineteenth century and it is
very interesting knowing that Picasso has never seen the earth from an
airplane, that being of the twentieth century he inevitably knew that
the earth is not the same as in the nineteenth century, he knew it,
he made it, inevitably he made it different and what he made is a thing
that now all the world can see. When I was in America I for the first
time travelled pretty much all the time in an airplane and when I looked
at the earth I saw all the lines of cubism made at a time when not any
painter had ever gone up in an airplane. I saw there on the earth the
mingling lines of Picasso, coming and going, developing and destroying
themselves, I saw the simple solutions of Braque, I saw the wandering
lines of Masson, yes I saw and once more I knew that a creator is
contemporary, he understands what is contemporary when the contemporaries
do not yet know it, but he is contemporary and as the twentieth century
is a century which sees the earth as no one has ever seen it, the earth
has a splendor that it never has had, and as everything destroys itself
in the twentieth century and nothing continues, so then the twentieth
century has a splendor which is its own and Picasso is of this century,
he has that strange quality of an earth that one has never seen and of
things destroyed as they have never been destroyed. So then Picasso has
his splendor. Yes. Thank you.

</blockquote>

<p>
In the cases of Hemingway and Waugh, if less so with Stein, one might
be tempted to dismiss the yoking of cubism to aerial perspective as
an instance of writerly agon against painterly innovation, an attempt
to domesticate cubism to a sort of proleptic documentarism through
the assertion of writerly metaphorical powers. But one finds the same
pairing in other quarters as well. By 1918, young British aviators were
being trained to see an avant-garde exhibition unfurling beneath their
cockpits: a First World War Royal Air Force photo atlas for new pilots
used "FUTURIST country" and "CUBIST country" in its taxonomy of aerial
landscapes, alongside more everyday mnemonic headings such as "FRUIT
GROWING" and "PATCHWORK QUILTING."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  And the coupling has been repeated enough in more recent scholarship to
  indicate its durable explanatory, or at least suggestive, power. Martin
  Jay proposes that the First World War earned Stein's designation
  of it as "cubist" principally for the views its pilots had of the
  trench-crossed landscape below them (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#1" name="1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  And Stephen Kern accepts a metaphorical, if not necessarily causal,
  relation between aerial perspective and cubism, summing up the
  similarities thus: "The Cubist reduction of depth, elimination of
  unessential detail, composition with simplified forms, and unification
  of the entire picture surface are pictorial representations of the view
  of the earth's surface from an airplane in flight" (<i>CTS,</i> 245).

<p>
There is something intuitively plausible about an association between
cubist painting and views of the earth from an airplane. Expanding
on Kern's summation, one might add that aerial views of developed,
populous city centers and of cultivated land often replace the
redundant, recursive, seemingly random curvilinearity of organic forms
with rectilinearity, or at least with a certain geometric regularity
and simplicity (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#2" name="2"> 2</a>). One might say that <i>bios</i> surrenders to
<i>logos</i> as the landscape offers itself to be

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 352]</b>

read, not as a dynamic habitat, but as a deposit of human intentionality,
as a planned text. The sharpened lines, clarified structure and geometric
shapes of the planned text, in turn, might be said to resonate with
cubist mechano-morphism. A machine aesthetic can thrive in the air:
from sufficient altitudes, the individual organism dwindles to the
vanishing point, bodies recede to exteriorized and genderless dots
circulating as particles in the fluid dynamics of the urban mass, made
visually contiguous with the material fabric of the city as viewed from
above. Alternately, the body diminishes to a data point in the emerging
statistical epistemes that were cognate with the aerial perspective in
their shared claims to spatially arrayed overviews of an aggregate of
such points. The impression that the earth has become a planar grid for
abstract data plotting is, in turn, visually enhanced by the flatness
of the high-altitude vertical view, with its paradoxical erasure of
the vertical dimension; and that leveling might further suggest cubist
rejections of perspectival convention in favor of a conspicuously
two-dimensional image plane whose depthlessness, like the aerial view's,
was no longer hospitable to the conventional pictorial distinction
between re and ground.

<p>
Yet in other ways, the coupling of cubist painting and aerial perspective
should arouse our skepticism. To begin with, it posits a single visual
correlative for an often divergent group of painters, collapsing a
range of formal, intentional, and ideological distinctions among them. In
addition, it sidelines the movement's infractions of conventional temporal
and spatial syntax, its projection onto a single and circumscribed
image plane of serial apprehensions of its objects. It reduces an only
partially mimetic visual vocabulary to the straightforward mimesis
(or, in Kern's words, the "pictorial representation") of a new vista,
replacing the novelty of the medium with that of the object, while at the
same time substituting a narrative about technologies of representation
with one about technologies of flight. Hemingway and Stein observe that
the earth from an airplane resembles cubist painting, but in formulating
that observation, both really make the reverse assertion: that cubist
painting was a cultural harmonic of, was even indebted to, the view of
the earth from above. Finally, this filiation or affiliation ignores the
fact that airborne viewing was not new to the twentieth century. Though
heavier-than-air flight evidently began with the Wrights in 1903,
lighter-than-air ascents had been taking place since the Montgolfier
balloons went up in 1783. As balloons became safer and more numerous,
the vertical view of the earth was no longer the exclusive privilege of an
aeronautical elite, but accessible to anyone who could afford the modest
price of a commercial ascent. Descriptions of balloon views of cities are
a populous subgenre of nineteenth-century ekphrastic writing, as etchings
and paintings of balloon vistas are of the period's visual culture. If we
are to connect the vocabularies of cubist painting with aeriality at all,
we need to ask what had changed about aerial viewing and its cultural
contexts between the late eighteenth century and the early twentieth.

<p>
One obvious starting point is the invention and fetishization of the
airplane shortly after the turn of the century. The airplane undoubtedly
altered the context of aerial viewing with its greater velocity
and navigability, its louder and more turbulent ride, and its very
unballoonlike aesthetic of loud engine, propeller, struts, wheels, flaps,

<b></b>

levers, instrument panels, bombs, and guns. Thus, when Filippo Marinetti
described how the vertical aerial view demanded a new poetic syntax in
his 1912 "Technical Manifesto of Futurism," he set his epiphany not in
the padded interior of a balloon's wicker gondola but astride the gas
tank of a Voisin biplane, where he had sat vibrating to its internal
combustion engine and listening to the dictations of its propeller.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  If fast, navigable, motor-driven, heavier-than-air flight didn't
  exactly deliver an unprecedented view of the earth, it at least
  provided a different set of procedures by which to achieve
  and manipulate that view and a novel array of sensations to
  accompany it. To the extent vision is informed by the body's full
  sensorium&#8212;mechanical vibration, engine noise, strong wind,
  pressure changes in the ear, nausea induced by changing gravitational
  forces, the euphoria of high speed&#8212;the airplane did alter aerial
  perception. But it was from the coupling of the airplane with the
  camera that the most extreme splendors and modes of destruction,
  to use Stein's words, precipitated. Paul Virilio writes that the
  ambition of most early balloonists "was not so much <i>to fly</i>
  as <i>to see from on high</i>."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  The formulation applies less fully to early aviators, for whom seeing
  from on high was less novel than being able to navigate their swifter
  craft more precisely than aeronauts could steer balloons. Nevertheless,
  this unprecedented degree of navigability in flight did open up the
  uses of aerial photography, which previously had been hamstrung by the
  balloon's captivity to prevailing winds. With its roughly constant
  speed, direction, and altitude, the airplane provided a steerable,
  stable platform from which a photographer could take photos in regular
  series, "covering" an entire area by flying over and photographing it
  in grid patterns at a consistent scale and orientation. Whereas photos
  taken from other airborne platforms (balloons, kites, rockets, even
  pigeons) had never produced much more than haphazard, if tantalizing,
  results, airplane photography was far more exploitable, quickly
  burgeoning in its commercial and military uses and gaining a much
  greater cultural visibility.

<p>
This essay, then, is concerned neither with the airplane itself nor
with the views its pilots and passengers enjoyed, but rather with the
photographic genres, techniques, and discourses that developed in tandem
with early aviation, and with their relation to avant-garde representation
in the first decades of the twentieth century. Though some of the photo
interpretation methods I discuss here were also deployed in interwar
civil contexts, the essay is principally devoted to the techniques
and technical discourse of aerial reconnaissance photography during
World War I. I have chosen the wartime focus partly because it was the
germinal site for airplane photography: the techniques and reflexive
discourse of aerial photography got exported out of their originary
military contexts into their commercial ones, not vice versa, and even
in those commercial contexts they retained a residue of their military
origins. More importantly, the emphasis here on wartime photography arises
from the fact that military reconnaissance was explicitly oriented around
equipping, training, and therefore describing human <i>observers</i>,
which I maintain is also the case with avant-garde representation during
the period. Whereas Stein, Hemingway, and others connected cubism and
the aerial view through their respective visual characteristics, I will
be less concerned here with visual syntax <i>tout court</i> than with
how wartime reconnaissance photographic techniques constructed

<b></b>

and conscripted a new kind of observer, and with how that observer might
be related to the observer imagined by cubism and other modernist forms
of representation. I will also suggest that the nature and objectives of
"interpretation" are refashioned by aerial reconnaissance and avant-garde
representation in similar enough ways to suggest that both refashionings
should be seen as symptomatic of one crisis in the period's dominant
scopic regime.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  My aim in positing the above relationships between aesthetic forms
  and military techniques is neither to aestheticize the work of
  wartime reconnaissance nor to recuperate the viewing of military
  aerial photographs as an avant-garde aesthetic experience. I wish,
  instead, to understand how the spectator conscripted by cubism might be
  cognate with the corresponding re in a military-industrial complex
  usually taken to be as remote as possible from an autochthonous,
  self-legislating, self-delighting aesthetic.

<p>
World War I has long been regarded as the first modern war in the scale
of casualties it produced, in its shift from contained fronts toward
"total war," and in its turn from aristocratic pageantry and honor
codes to technological, depersonalized, even democratized killing. But
a number of recent accounts have characterized the Great War as also
witnessing or catalyzing a crisis in perception. According to Virilio,
"1914 was not only the physical deportation of millions of men to the
fields of battle, it was also, with the apocalypse of the deregulation
of perception, a diaspora of another kind, the moment of panic in which
the American and European masses no longer believed their eyes."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  For Martin Jay, this loss of faith in ocular proof marked the final
  overthrow of the "ancien scopic r&eacute;gime" of ocularcentric
  Cartesian perspectivalism (<i>DE,</i> 212-3). Yet World War I was
  also the most optical war yet, a war in which observation involved no
  longer the reconnaissance and reports of lone scouts on foot, but a
  complex technological matrix: semiautomated aerial cameras obtained
  photographic coverage of the entire front, and the photomosaic maps
  compiled from this coverage were reproduced through industrialized
  techniques and widely disseminated; observers in airplanes and balloons
  reported by Morse lamp and later by wireless telegraph to command
  posts, using the coordinates on gridded aerial photos to direct
  artillery fire; aerial photographic sorties recorded not only the
  enemy's trench and gun placements but the production and movements
  of weapons, goods, and armies far behind the front. Contemporary
  accounts of this aspect of the war bear little obvious witness to a
  crisis in ocularcentrism, tending rather to celebrate the accuracy
  of the Allied reconnaissance matrix, and particularly its airborne
  components, as indispensable to victory. Walter Raleigh's 1922
  encomium to the scopic power of aerial reconnaissance is typical,
  exhibiting if anything a renewed faith in the power of ocular proof:
  "Reconnaissance, or observation, can never be superseded; knowledge
  comes before power; and the air is first of all a place to see from."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  Such rhetoric may well be compensatory for a felt crisis in visual
  perception, but if so, we need to understand how such a crisis
  could have been initiated, or at least accelerated, by the very
  reconnaissance modes that encomiasts celebrated as infallibly precise,
  revealing, potent.

<p>
To this end, we first need to become familiar with the specific terms
in which aerial "recco" photography was consecrated, in Alan Sekula's
phrase, as the "triumph of applied

<b></b>

realism" during and immediately following the First World War.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  In essence, aerial photos were seen to surpass all other visual
  forms in their accuracy, information saturation, and immunity to
  rhetorical distortion. "Everything revealed in an aerial photograph
  means something, and in warfare margins of error are neither safe
  nor officially acknowledged," a British interwar textbook on aerial
  photography asserts of wartime photographic interpretation; "Accuracy
  alone was not enough."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  If interpretation might exceed the standard of mere "accuracy,"
  it was because an image form in which "everything means something"
  already contained data in excess of that standard, approaching the real
  in its disregard for informational economy. Having canonized aerial
  photography as a paradise of pure signification, the same text goes
  on to speculate that the aerial photograph might eventually succeed
  more abstract survey genres, replacing the map's imprecise semiosis
  with its unmediated plenitude:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is possible that the time may come when for cadastral and ordinance
purposes the aerial photographic survey will be accepted as a map
after the customary references already provided by drawn maps have
been added. Whereas trees and the like are illustrated on the drawn
map by cadastral signs presented in positions that call for the use of
imagination or reference to the key in the body of the map, vertical
aerial photographs reveal the formation, lay-out and even nature of
forestry and other terrestrial marks, thus giving a true topographical
impression of the earth's surface. . . . open spaces are recorded in
detail, and waterways and coastlines revealed by the aerial photograph
do not lie. [<i>CS</i>, 13]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Replacing the generalized symbol of a tree with the image of the
particular tree, the abstracted red line with the image of the road in
question, aerial photos would eliminate the need for "imagination or
reference to the key in the body of the map"&#8212;that is, the need for
decoding the semiotics of the map. Having initially existed in imagination
only, the bird's eye view had, in its photographic embodiment, refined
both semiosis and "imagination" out of its circuits altogether, arriving
at a nearly self-identical relation with the real. Such a relation
was seen to resist the tendentious motives of photographer, viewer, or
subject, and thus to guarantee the factual status and accuracy of the
image. The photographer Edward Steichen, who finished the war as chief
of the U.S. Air Service Photographic Section, called aerial photographs
"an unequalled historical document of the great war. They represent
neither opinions nor prejudice, but indisputable facts."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  In his memoirs, Steichen claimed that the unrivalled precision of
  reconnaissance photography roused him from the impressionistic reverie
  of his early painterly photographs, awakening him to the virtues of
  a sharper-edged, more accessible image (i.e., the capitalist realism
  of his postwar work for Madison Avenue).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  To take accounts like Steichen's, or Winchester and Wills's, at
  face value is to find in aerial reconnaissance photography the
  last bastion of na&iuml;ve realism, and during a period more often
  celebrated for its extreme departures from the realist matrix of
  Cartesian perspectivalism.

<p>
Looking at wartime aerial photography in its technical and discursive
contexts, however, one finds that such realist claims attempted
simultaneously to ward off the supposed

<b></b>

disrements of the contemporary avant-garde and to downplay the
equally disring and exaggerative ways in which aerial photographs
were actually decoded and deployed. In their more technical chapters
on photographic interpretation, the same manuals that prophesied the
eventual replacement of maps with aerial photographs acknowledged the
absurdity of that prophecy. During the First World War, a whole school
of aerial photographic interpretation grew up to extract information
from recco photos, which, though they did not necessarily lie, also
did not represent the truth in a way that was immediately legible or
self-evident to the untrained viewer. Winchester and Wills write:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The interpretation of aerial photographs was, of course, a real problem
and one of vast importance. It meant considerable training of men of
high intelligence, and at first much of the training depended upon
guess-work as well as deduction, for it was only by an ever-increasing
experience that the interpreters could learn the significance of
new details and classify their deductions until they had a reliable
photographic key or code upon which to work and through which to teach
new recruits. The smallest detail had to be accounted for in terms of
military importance. Nothing was too slight to escape the attention of
those whose difficult task it was to provide rational explanations of
the photographs. [<i>CS</i>, 8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If a signal that is exhaustively pure requires an equally exhaustive
regime of interpretation, then that signal stands revealed as already
coded. Aerial photographs possessed the conceit of laying reality bare
by their deadly accuracy, their vertical penetration, their plenitude or
even excess of detail, and their ability to reveal facts, objects, and
strategic intentions not otherwise accessible. But this realist conceit
was mitigated by an accompanying insistence on the defamiliarizing
power of the vertical view, on the sense that even the reality beneath
the enemy's camouflage was self-camouflaging, and on the need for new
codes by which a highly trained interpretive elite could decipher the
camouflage of the real. This new interpretive corps also had to learn to
rectify the broad range of distortions to which aerial photographs were
susceptible&#8212;distortions resulting from airplane vibration and tilt,
fluctuations in altitude and scale, relief displacement, imperfect lenses
and shutters, film warping, paper shrinkage or expansion, aerial haze. And
as the following section illustrates, reconnaissance photos not only were
subject to distortion but, in their single most strategically crucial
use&#8212;aerial stereoscopy&#8212;actually required distortion to be
legible. In exploiting the structural idiosyncrasies of aerial photos and
human optical anatomy, aerial stereoscopy required that photo interpreters
learn more than a new "photographic key or code"; they had to relearn
depth perception, retraining their optical reflexes to see, in effect,
through the surrogate eyes of a virtual colossus. Calling forth relief
effects in hallucinogenic exaggeration from flat images, the stereoscope
enabled its trained users to perform seemingly preternatural acts of
perception and interpretation. But the stereoscope and the reconnaissance
methods in which it played an essential role did not, strangely,
produce observers who believed in the panoptical power attributed to
them by propaganda and triumphalist historical accounts. Because the
new intelligence techniques exploited rather than denied the limitations
and site specificity of perception, they

<b></b>

produced observers who were confronted constantly with the spatial and
temporal contingency of human vision and were therefore more willing
to extend it by subjecting their bodies, their perceptual habits, even
their memories and their emotions, to redisciplining and insertion within
a massive optical prosthesis.

<p>
Of course, the stereoscope's use in World War I aerial reconnaissance
was not the first arena in which it schematized and capitalized
on the site-specific elements of vision. Nor should the device be
understood deterministically as a technological agent of philosophical
or cultural crisis. Jonathan Crary has characterized the much earlier
parlor stereoscope, which became a popular domestic curiosity around
1850, as paradigmatic of the dominant status of the observer during the
nineteenth century, much as the camera obscura was for the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. The stereoscope, Crary argues, was neither
the cause of theories of vision or crises of visual faith, nor simply
a haphazard invention of the 1830s; it was, rather, a crystallization
of contemporary demands, anxieties, and developments in physiological
optics, epistemology, aesthetics, mechanics, and political economy. It
embodied the transition from a geometrical optics to a physiological one,
relocating the "events" of vision from an empirically verifiable outside
world to the more idiosyncratic domain of the body. At the same time,
it symptomatized the decline of classical associations of sight with
clear and distinct perception, and the rise of theories of subjective
vision, which reimagined the observer as the site as well as the subject
of perceptual inscription. Crary writes:<br />



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The stereoscopic viewer sees neither the identity of a copy nor the
coherence guaranteed by the frame of a window. Rather, what appears is
the technical reconstitution of an already reproduced world fragmented
into two nonidentical models, models that precede any experience of their
subsequent perception as unified or tangible. The institutionalization
of this decentered observer and the stereoscope's dispersed and multiple
sign severed from a point of external reference indicate a greater break
with a classical observer than that which occurs later in the century
in the realm of painting. The stereoscope signals an eradication of
"the point of view" around which, for several centuries, meanings had
been assigned reciprocally to an observer and the object of his or her
vision. There is no longer the possibility of perspective under such a
technique of beholding. The relation of observer to image is no longer to
an object quantified in relation to a position in space, but rather to
two dissimilar images whose position simulates the anatomical structure
of the observer's body.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Particularly in its earliest incarnations, the stereoscope foregrounded
the process by which the human visual apparatus melds dissimilar images
into an illusion of three-dimensional unity and thus schematized human
depth perception as a perpetual <i>effect</i> of the viewer's physiology,
rather than a <i>fact</i> about how the world "was." Additionally, it
dissociated touch and sight, creating depth effects that looked palpable
but were not; having effected this dissociation, it subordinated touch
to sight, making tangibility

<b></b>

seem a hallucination or special effect of optics. And it explicitly
enlisted its viewer in the work of producing a realistic image, insisting
that the viewer was less the user of a tool than a component in a visual
apparatus, standing in a relation of contiguity rather than mastery,
of metonymy rather than metaphor, with the device. In thus constructing
its user as a part of the mechanism, the stereoscope stood in a metonymic
relation to industrial modes of production, which transformed the worker
from an agent of tool use to one of many components in a mechanized
manufacturing process. Though the stereoscope has often been treated as
a crucial representational technology of realism in its uncanny power
of making objects seem tangibly present within a deep image space,
Crary's analysis suggests that, to the contrary, it embodied a complex
of increasingly nonveridical theories of vision that a na&iuml;ve realism
would eventually be unable to assimilate.

<p>
As a popular novelty, the nineteenth-century stereoscope performed
verisimilitude as a sort of parlor trick. Through it, viewers watched
pairs of adjacent flat images&#8212;typically depicting cluttered
interiors, exotic landscapes, teeming city scenes&#8212;fused and
jutting into a compressed three-dimensionality comprised of distal and
proximate depth planes (. <a href="10.2saint_res.html#3" name="3">3</a> and <a href="10.2saint_res.html#4" name="4">4</a>). In its First World War military
rehabilitation, the stereoscope was conscripted into a different role:
it became "the worst foe of camouflage," a device for decoding the
enemy's visual encryptions of the landscape.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Owing to the limitations of human optical geometry, neither unaided
  visual observation from the air nor single aerial photographs proved
  much good against camouflage or decoys, two optical tactics that
  bedeviled reconnaissance observers during the first year of the
  war. By the summer of 1915, however, camera semiautomation enabled
  pilots to take a series of aerial photographs close enough together
  that the ground depicted in adjacent photos in the series overlapped.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  By putting these overlapping pairs of aerial photos under the
  stereoscope, photo interpreters could use the device's virtual
  stereopsis to tell bomb craters from mounds and trenches from
  embankments. They could distinguish flat decoy bridges and aircraft
  from real ones; they could see through some kinds of camouflage and
  forest covering to the objects hidden beneath. And if the overlapping
  photo pairs were taken at wide enough spatial intervals, interpreters
  could even see part of the ground underneath bridges. By conjuring the
  impression of elevation from flat images of a remote and miniaturized
  surface, aerial stereoscopy put the photographic interpreter above, and
  seemingly inside, a three-dimensional scale model of the landscape. In
  a sense, the stereoscope also put the landscape inside the viewer:
  like its domestic predecessor, aerial stereoscopy depended for its
  effects as much on the viewer's optical anatomy as on the device's
  placement of overlapping photo pairs, fusing the stereoscope and
  the photo interpreter into a single viewing apparatus. By the
  midpoint of World War I, aerial stereoscopy had become a staple in
  the reconnaissance repertoire of decryptive technologies aimed at
  exposing the enemy's secrecy to a "pitiless publicity" (<i>AP,</i>
  18). <i>Popular Mechanics</i> would later name the stereoscope "the
  deadliest weapon in the war."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Given the stereoscope's vaunted power of peering around corners, making
the minutest photographic details betray the concealed intentions of
the enemy, one is hardly

<b></b>

surprised to find the wartime aerial photographic interpreter
hailed repeatedly as a detective. In his 1920 textbook on <i>Airplane
Photography</i>, Herbert Ives describes military photo interpretation as
"a task of minute study and deduction worthy of Sherlock Holmes." Harold
Porter writes that once an interpreter has scaled a photograph, "there
are only two steps&#8212;to see what is on the photograph, and to make
your conclusions. Sherlock Holmes would have adored it."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, we should recall, straddles the
  threshold between a form of realism and a natural supernaturalism. In
  his self-representations, he is merely a practitioner-advocate of
  simple veridical technologies (observation, deduction) that allow
  him to restore dislodged objects and deranged subjects to their
  proper domains, proportions, and narrative functions. But at the
  same time, he is one in whom these technologies are so extremely
  realized&#8212;sometimes through his willingness to distort or even
  reject "normal" scopic and deductive regimes&#8212;that they become
  "powers," giving him a hotline to the real so direct that it appears
  magical.

<b></b>

<p>
Like their fictional patron saint, aerial photographic detectives from
World War I on arrived at their documentary narratives about the location,
circulation, and strategic significance of military resources by way
of a detour through magic, in this case that of an optical trickery
that allowed them to decipher the enemy's visual codes by way of a
counterdistortion or counterillusion: hyperstereoscopy. For Victorian
parlor stereoscopes, photographic stereopairs were taken through
two adjacent lenses whose focal points were the same distance apart
as the human pupils, i.e., about 2.75 inches. Reproducing the body's
interpupillary distance, this <i>orthostereoscopy</i> retained the relief
proportions of "normal" depth perception by replicating the dimensions
of human parallax, the apparent displacement of foreground in relation to
background when viewed from two different points. <i>Hyperstereoscopy</i>
occurs whenever stereopairs are taken from points whose separation exceeds
the interpupillary distance. Because unaided human stereopsis drops out
at distances over fifteen hundred or two thousand feet, hyperstereoscopy
became the rule rather than the exception in aerial reconnaissance. From
an aircraft flying at even a modest altitude, the ground is too remote for
the naked eyes' sightlines to converge significantly enough to experience
stereopsis&#8212;hence the apparent flatness of vertical aerial views.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  However, taking stereopairs with an interaxial separation greater than
  2.75 inches could compensate for the increased distance between viewer
  and object by increasing parallax accordingly. Hyperstereoscopy enabled
  human observers to see as if through eyes set farther apart than
  their own, effectively readjusting the scale of the observer's optical
  geometry in relation to a remote object so that depth perception was
  once again possible. Separated from the ground by giant distances, the
  observer swelled back to proportions commensurate with stereoscopic
  vision by seeing through the eyes of a giant. This virtual gigantism
  effectively rescaled landscapes&#8212;usually so remote as to cancel
  stereopsis&#8212;into interiors with considerable relief effects,
  domesticating high-altitude views of fronts and cities by giving them
  the tangibility of a cluttered, tchotchke-strewn drawing room. Yet
  the actual images read by photo interpreters were minuscule, often in
  scales of 1:25,000 or smaller. Reconnaissance observers, therefore,
  grew accustomed to a vertiginous elasticity of scale, oscillating
  between the scale of their own bodies, the minute scale of the aerial
  photo, and the colossal scale of hyperstereopsis.

<p>
During World War I, aerial stereoscopic pairs used for reconnaissance
were not taken simultaneously by a dual-lens camera but diachronically by
an automated single-lens device, and were then paired up later under the
interpreter's stereoscope. These temporally serial photographs were shot
at intervals of 14.5 seconds from a plane flying at around sixty miles
per hour, so that stereopairs were taken with an average interaxial
distance of 1,250 feet, over 5,400 times the human interpupillary
distance (<i>AC,</i> 53) (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#5" name="5"> 5</a>). Such large multiples meant that the
apparent relief was not just restored up to the "normal" dimensions of
more proximate objects, but exaggerated well past it (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#6" name="6"> 6</a>). Initially
this exaggeration and the spatiotemporal interval that caused it were
technical side effects: the slow reloading speeds of semiautomatic cameras
resulted in the plane's covering a substantial distance between shots. But
that accidental distortion crucially improved the vertical legibility,
and thus the strategic utility, of

<b></b>

aerial stereoscopy. Beaumont Newhall, who worked as a U.S. military photo
interpreter during World War II, describes the interpretive advantages
of hyperstereoscopy as they were discovered during the Great War:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Unlike those stereoscopic views, once so popular, which give a convincing,
"realistic" illusion of depth, pairs of overlapping aerial photographs
give an exaggerated, highly distorted sense of height. Hummocks
become hills, gulches seem to be deep chasms, and ordinary houses,
skyscrapers. This exaggeration helps the interpreter: a machine gun

<b></b>

emplacement seems to rise up from the ground; he can look under the
bridge as well as on it; he can count long trains of freight cars and
see the crumbling walls of bombed targets. [<i>AC,</i> 53]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Aerial stereoscopy bestowed a seemingly supernatural, Asmodean power of
seeing around, under, and through structures from above. It did so not by
restoring orthostereoscopic verisimilitude but by departing willfully from
it. The truly resourceful photographic interpreter was not held back by a
need for lifelike dimensions and elevations, but instead wrung the neck
of realism and, in return, gained entry to a virtual landscape at once
"highly distorted," in that the apparent proportions of its binocular
space had been altered, and more starkly legible. Here we should remember
that aerial photography was generally touted by its practitioners as the
representational mode most nearly approaching the asymptote of the real. A
tension existed between the putative realism of aerial photography on
the one hand and, on the other, its resistance to full decryption except
through the miraculous distortion of hyperstereoscopy. This tension
registers in interpretive manuals and textbooks written during and after
World War I, often taking shape in embarrassed equivocations:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Stereograms made with too large exposure intervals show exaggerated
relief. Yet this is often no objection. It is indeed rather an advantage
if we wish to bring objects of interest to notice. Consequently, so long
as the exaggeration of relief is not offensive, the permissible limits of
exposure interval are pretty large. Actually, the eye tolerates such great
deviations from strictly normal conditions that satisfactory stereoscopic
effects are obtained for pictures viewed at very different distances
from the focal length of the taking lens, and with the axes of the eyes
parallel or even diverging, although there is some strain whenever focus
and convergence points differ. On the whole, therefore, it may be said
that the conditions above laid down for correct relief are only a normal,
to be approximated as nearly as is practicable. [<i>AP,</i> 337-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By tentatively allowing exaggerated relief as "no objection" so long
as it is "not offensive," Ives relativizes the "normal" dimensions of
human vision as "<i>a</i> normal," as a baseline from which to depart
in favor of distortions that allowed more data to be extracted from the
plenum of the aerial photo. Normal dimensions are marginalized here as a
question of mere taste (the baseline from which we judge what is and is
not "offensive"), while strategic utility is brought forward as the more
pressing criterion; the perceptual extremes underwritten by military
exigency eclipse the notion of a "true" vision centered in a human
optical norm and, in the process, mine more truth from the image than
human-centered vision could. Since any appreciable stereoscopic vision at
high altitudes is itself the result of a distortion that compensates for
the limits of unaided stereopsis, then the former "truth" of biological
stereoscopy stands revealed as increasingly <i>hypostereoscopic</i> as
distances increase, requiring a complex system of prosthetic technologies
(airplane, camera, stereoscope) to restore it to a now-destabilized
normal.

<p>
Yet even as it relativized the dimensions and limitations of the body's
stereopsis, aerial stereoscopy insisted in other ways on the bodiliness
and spatial contingency of

<b></b>

the observer. The pervasive assumption that aerial photos present
"totalizing" views of their subjects ignores the fact that the
strategic utility of aerial photos lay in their exploitable spatial
specificity. Vertical aerial photographs depict perfectly vertical
views only of objects directly beneath the center of the lens; elevated
objects not along that axis lean radially away from the center, and
to a greater degree the farther away they are from that nadir; in a
sense, then, vertical photos grow increasingly oblique toward their
peripheries (fish-eye lenses merely exaggerate this phenomenon). Though
this relief displacement presented a problem for joining overlapping
photos into mosaic-maps, it was a sine qua non for aerial stereopsis:
the stereoscope fused the distinct relief displacements of its stereopairs
into an apparent three-dimensionality. However, in order to perceive that
stereoptic effect properly, interpreters had to factor in another defining
characteristic of the aerial photo: shadows. Early interpretive manuals
insist that in order to preserve the light vectors of the photographic
image, aerial stereopairs must be positioned with the shadows falling
away from the observer's light source, and thus toward the observer. The
observer who failed to reproduce the photograph's light vectors under
the stereoscope would find relief inverted in a <i>pseudoscopic</i>
effect: holes would appear as mounds, and trenches as walls (. <a href="10.2saint_res.html#7" name="7">7</a>
and <a href="10.2saint_res.html#8" name="8">8</a>). Sometimes pseudoscopic effects could arise from hemispheric
conditioning as well. Harold Porter's <i>Aerial Observation</i> 
recounts how, during World War I, a Brazilian pilot and reconnaissance
trainee misread shell craters as German gun emplacements on an aerial
photo: "The Brazilian aviator was reared of course in the southern
hemisphere where the sun is always north and where the shadows fall to
the south. He saw in the picture just the reverse of what the Britishers
saw, and he had not received enough training to know that he might
[<i>sic</i>] always adjust his mind to the difference." Porter goes on
to express doubts about the accuracy of the story, which he views as
"too good to be true, but it demonstrates the point perfectly. First,
orient your photograph."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  In this case, however, "orientation" meant more than aligning the photo
  coverage with mapped space and compass points, or even recreating
  original light conditions. It was seen to entail a reprogramming
  of the individual interpreter's idiosyncratic perceptual circuits
  in accordance with a hemispherically specific theater of war. In
  respect to relief displacement, shadow orientation, and hemisphere,
  aerial stereoscopy insisted not only on a spatially contingent camera,
  but on an incarnated observer, one who had to be properly oriented
  toward light, image, and perceptual habits while being lowered, so to
  speak, into the virtual cockpit of the stereo image. Borrowing a term
  from linguistics, we might say that aerial stereoscopy was spatially
  <i>deictic</i>, that is, explicitly cognizant of the context-specific
  "here" that partly constitutes the act of seeing. Far from delivering
  a disembodied but immediately legible overview of its objects, aerial
  stereophotography did as much to expose the spatial and biological
  contingency of its observers as it did to lay bare the terrain it
  depicted. A scopic regime initially celebrated, and later criticized,
  as totalizing was useful in proportion as it exploited&#8212;and
  in the process, foregrounded&#8212;the radically deictic aspects of
  depth perception and of seeing generally.

<b></b>

<p>
But if aerial stereoscopy did not provide the promised totalizing views
of the earth's surface, it compensated in the extreme demands it made
of its observers. As Porter writes, quoting one of his First World War
photo interpretation instructors, "To interpret an aerial photograph is to
reverse the habits of a lifetime" (<i>AO,</i> 177). As we have seen, this
reversal of habits meant much more than learning to recognize trenches,

<b></b>

gun emplacements, and runways in a vertical high-altitude photo. It
involved the systematic redisciplining of observers' perceptual circuits
in relation to the narrow requirements of a complex prosthetic optical
regime. Before they could realign their bodies with the sightlines
and shadowlines of stereopairs, observers first had to learn to use
a stereoscope, or at least to use it in the hyperstereoscopic mode
demanded by reconnaissance work (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#9" name="9"> 9</a>). This was not as simple as
looking through a pair of binoculars, a magnifying glass, or a jeweler's
loupe. As one World War II-era manual puts it, observers had to learn to
"acquire voluntary control over a previously involuntary reflex," or,
in more precise optical terms, to dissociate the visual reflexes of
convergence and association, reflexes that usually operate in concert.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  In essence, observers had to focus their eyes on images just a
  few inches away; but they had to prevent the sightlines of left
  and right eye from converging on a single close-up image as they
  would in unaided stereopsis, instead keeping each eye directed at
  its corresponding stereopair (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#0" name="0"> 10</a>). Not everyone could achieve
  artificial stereopsis, and even those who eventually succeeded had
  to practice, often experiencing eyestrain and headaches along the
  way. Another 1940s reconnaissance manual counsels patience, noting that
  "many persons have mastered the trick only after having worked 15 to
  20 hours with stereo-prints." But it consoles its readers with the
  promise that their efforts will reward them with an almost violent 3-D
  epiphany: "When coincidence of the photographs is secured, as above,
  the relief should seem to come right up and hit you."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Firsthand accounts of aerial stereoscopy by Great War interpreters are
scarce, but their Second World War counterparts&#8212;several of them
officers in the British Women's Auxiliary Air Force&#8212;used very
similar methods, and wrote memoirs documenting their first encounters
with the stereoscope in the context of reconnaissance work. These
accounts vividly describe the epiphanic moment of stereo fusion,
but they are equally vivid in recounting what personal associations
that moment precipitated or displaced. Former WAAF photo interpreter
Constance Babington-Smith describes her first successful stereoscopic
session during the early months of World War II:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I stood [the stereoscope] above a pair of prints as I had seen some of the
others doing. I could see two images, not one, and there really did not
seem much point. It was much simpler to work with an ordinary magnifying
glass. I edged the two prints backward and forward a bit&#8212;still
two images; and then suddenly the thing happened, the images fused,
and the buildings in the photograph shot up toward me so that I almost
drew back. It was the same sort of feeling of triumph and wonder that
I remember long ago when I first stayed up on a bicycle without someone
holding on behind. From then on interpretation was much easier.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Babington-Smith would play a key role in British intelligence efforts
against the German aircraft industry and <i>Vergeltungswaffen</i>,
or "revenge weapons," the V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. But her
first artificial stereopsis triggered memories of childhood rather
than prophecies about strategic detective work. Her WAAF colleague,
Ursula Powys-Lybbe, writes how, in peering down through the scope, she
also gazed back in time at her own childhood, except that here it is a
childhood in which the

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 367]</b>

stereoscope itself had played a role. The device acts as both a purveyor
and an object of nostalgia:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sometimes, when I was a small girl, a treasured box of glass slides would
be brought out accompanied by a wooden viewer with two black eyepieces,
and I would be allowed to put a slide into the viewer and stare through
the eyepieces at a fairy-tale world of sparkling snow, high mountains
and dark trees&#8212;then suddenly and breath-takingly, my mother and
father were standing like real people and looking at me&#8212;not flat
people as in an ordinary photograph. The slides had been taken during
my parents' honeymoon in Switzerland.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
That childish thrill was felt by everyone who, for the first time managed
to shuffle a stereo pair of aerial photographs into the correct position
in the viewer. It might have taken a little time, and you felt convinced
that something was wrong with your eyes, and you strained your muscles
and tried squinting and then magic! Shapes in plan were transformed into
real-life ships or churches or bridges. You begged for more prints,
and like the child with its new plaything, you spent a half-hour in a
wonderland of discovery.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In its reconnaissance application, the stereoscope's power lay not just
in making the enemy's intentions seem legible in the landscape, but in
reawakening the observers' personal associations with the medium and
channeling them toward the ends of military intelligence. These observers
had encountered its technological forerunner, the parlor stereoscope, in
another world&#8212;in peacetime, in childhood, in domestic spaces where
stereograms embodied and catalyzed longing for the past, for possession
of a toy-sized world, for escape to exotic locales. By appropriating
the same optical technology for reconnaissance, aerial stereoscopy wrote
over its observers' first associations; after the war, they would never
again regard the stereoscope simply as a portal to personal nostalgia or
reverie. But while they squinted through its eyepieces at 3-D images of
tiny docklands, factories, airfields, and launch platforms, the device
mobilized their affective ties to its former uses, imbuing aerial views
of military and industrial sites with the glamour of magic, fantasy,
wonder, and play.

<p>
The stereoscopic image also camouflaged its own mode of reproduction
through the impression of palpable immediacy it conferred on its
objects. Amplified by the brief tactical currency of the photos,
the image's aura of presence insisted urgently on the here and now
of interpretation, collapsing the distance its constituent photos
had actually traveled from the site they depicted to the observer's
scope. That distance was not only spatial and temporal but technological
and industrial as well: once the camera plane had landed safely, the
cartridges of exposed film were rushed through a technically cutting-edge
process of accelerated mass reproduction. Allan Sekula describes this
process of development and dissemination:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The making of these reconnaissance prints was one of the first instances
of virtual assembly-line image production. (Henry Ford's first automobile
assembly-line became operative only in 1914.) The establishment of this
method of production grew out of demands for resolution, volume, and
immediacy. No method of reproduction but direct printing from the original
negative would hold the detail necessary for reconnaissance purposes.

<b></b>

Large numbers of prints from a single negative had to be made for
distribution throughout the hierarchy of command. In addition, the
information in prints dated very rapidly. Under these circumstances,
efficiency depended on a thorough-going division of labor and a virtually
continuous speedup of the work process. Printers worked in unventilated,
makeshift darkrooms; 20 workers might produce as many as 1,500 prints
in an hour, working 16-hour shifts.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As one terminus of this industrialized developing process, reconnaissance
interpreters belonged to a kind of consumer vanguard, benefiting from
techniques of photographic mass production that had not yet reached
consumers in civil society. Installed in comparatively safe and
well-organized facilities, they were insulated from the spectrum of
violence involved in obtaining and developing the photos, a spectrum
that included not only dead pilots and wrecked camera planes, but the
exploitive use of conscript labor to ensure the tactical currency and
bulk dissemination of the photos. At the same time, the observers'
status as professional interpreters of industrially mass-produced
images, along with the esoteric nature of their calculations and
surveillance, helped conceal the fact that they also belonged to one of
several classes of worker within the perception-and-targeting machine of
military intelligence. And like most of the workers in the reconnaissance
production line, they learned to experience extended shifts, repetitive
labor, physical strain, and insulation from the violence their "product"
recorded and facilitated, as a rare species of privilege.

<p>
If the glamour of the interpreters' work exceeded that of developers
and even pilots, it did so because of their singular position within the
power/knowledge grid of military intelligence. As we have seen, aerial
stereoscopy, like the general work of photo interpretation to which it
belonged, was situated within a professional narrative of forgetting,
relearning, practice, and eventual mastery&#8212;a narrative of election
and initiation into a top secret coterie, heavily defended by codes and
shibboleths. It was a narrative that consolidated the identity of an
elite interpretive school, one whose power lay not in the mere ability
to command, but in the more rarefied capacity of producing the knowledge
that would inform the commanders&#8212;recall Walter Raleigh's boast that
"Reconnaissance, or observation, can never be superseded; knowledge comes
before power; and the air is first of all a place to see from." Having
gazed with childlike fascination into the miniaturized wonderland beneath
their stereoscopes, the colleagues of Babington-Smith and Powys-Lybbe,
like their Great War predecessors, produced the maps and memos that would,
in turn, direct the Allied bombs. After the missions, they would confirm
the destruction of the same enchanting objects that had held them in a
reverie of detection. In confirming how their detective work had led to
the alteration or annihilation of the terrain and structures recorded
in reconnaissance photos, observers also confirmed the alteration of
their own perceptual systems. To attain stereovision, they had learned
to dissociate their optical reflexes of convergence and accommodation,
in the process retraining their bodies to become contiguous with an
elaborate weapons system that began by recording, identifying, and
interpreting its objects, and ended by targeting and finally destroying
them. They had become acclimated to a vertigo of scale, learning to be
at least three perceptual sizes at once. Most

<b></b>

chillingly, they had retrained themselves affectively so that an
optical medium formerly invested in childhood, memory, genealogy,
and fantasy could retain the force of that affective tie, but refocus
it on the surveillance and obliteration of military, industrial, and
eventually civilian targets. In this respect, the observer-interpreters
themselves&#8212;their bodies, their reflexes, their mnemonic
associations, their affective investments&#8212;were the secondary
targets of their own reconnaissance work.

Observing Cubism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In turning now to consider the relationships between Great War perceptual
vocabularies and cubist ones, we are entering a well-cultivated
critical terrain, one in which cubism has been seen as anticipating or
influencing wartime phenomena as diverse as psychological fragmentation,
the rectilinearity of the trench environment, the deprivileging of
perspectival centers, and spatial disorientation, along with temporal
acceleration, dilation, and rupture. Some of the cubists themselves saw
elements of the Great War's perceptual repertoire emanating from their
work. Gertrude Stein recalled being with Picasso, on the Boulevard Raspail
during the early months of the war, when he first saw camouflage painted
on a truck: "It was at night, we had heard of camouflage but we had not
yet seen it and Picasso amazed looked at it and then cried out, yes it
is we who made it, that is cubism" (<i>P,</i> 18). More conventional
accounts of the origins of camouflage point to a need to conceal troops,
weapons, and supplies from longer-range guns and the extended optical
range of the enemy's airborne reconnaissance, but the pragmatism of
that need does not rule out the deployment of a cubist visual syntax in
meeting it. Stephen Kern cites at least one account of a direct descent
from cubism to camouflage: Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc&eacute;vola, an
artilleryman who became the first French <i>camoufleur</i>, claimed that
"In order to totally deform objects, I employed the means Cubists used
to represent them," a decision that resulted in his hiring painters who,
"because of their special vision, had an aptitude for denaturing any
kind of form whatsoever."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Putatively developed to express a manifold but no less "real" or
  "essential" notion of perception, cubism had been drafted into
  a military function whose semiotic operations&#8212;encryption
  versus decryption, nature versus denaturing, form versus
  deformation&#8212;were far more binary than its own appeared to
  be. Stein wrote that "war is only a publicity agent which makes
  every one know what has happened"&#8212;that is, war foregrounds the
  perceptual sea changes that have already occurred in the culture at
  large and registered in its artistic vanguards (<i>P,</i> 45). If this
  is so, the Great War either caricatured cubism in publicizing it or
  exposed the fact that cubism had, from its inception, possessed an
  encryptive function that suited it to the oppositional perceptual
  space of the battlefield. In the latter case, the Great War would
  have been cubist only insofar as cubism was already combat-ready.

<p>
But if camouflage was among the war's publicizations of cubist innovation,
how could the reconnaissance techniques that helped prompt the invention
of camouflage, and that were subsequently dubbed its "worst foe," be
said to share a perceptual etiology with cubism?<br />
As we have seen, aerial photography was initially celebrated as capturing

<b></b>

a plenitude of accurate data, as the photographic genre whose content
was least contaminated by rhetoric. By contrast, cubist painting was
received as extending the impressionist, postimpressionist, and fauvist
disjunctions of object and depiction, pushing representation toward the
condition of pure, nonmimetic, code. Though we have also seen that aerial
reconnaissance photos were far more coded, contingent, and "produced"
than is generally recognized, they still operated within an intelligence
context whose legitimizing narrative was one of panoptical realism. That
context used technologically enhanced modes of seeing to translate raw
visual data into targeting data, progressively narrowing the gap between
perception and destruction. Cubist painting might be said to enact, or
at least testify to, the violent refraction, attenuation, dismemberment,
and flattening of the subjects named by its often conventional, even
academic work titles (<i>Violin</i>, <i>Female Nude</i>, <i>Still
Life with Violin and Pitcher</i>, <i>Guitar on Table</i>). The 1915
critical complaint that Duchamp's <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i>
resembled "an explosion in a shingle factory" testified, at least,
to this apparent representational violence, one that seems consonant
with the violent and changeful period (1907-1914) during which cubism
initially flourished. But can one really go so far as to link the
harmonic and representational violence of cubism to reconnaissance
techniques used to organize physical violence against an enemy army
and military-industrial complex?

<p>
By the above characterizations, the realist tenets of reconnaissance will
seem, at most, to be a curative response to the perceptual disorder
of cubism. The two would be etiologically related, then, only in
the sense that a disorder and its treatment can be said to share an
etiology. But we have also seen that the hyperrealist claims made on
behalf of reconnaissance were accompanied by an internal recognition
that camouflage&#8212;a distortion or concealment of an object's visual
signature&#8212;was the general rather than the exceptional case of
vision, and that countering it involved not so much undoing distortion
as offering a counterdistortion, one that manifestly did not restore or
recuperate the real. In this respect, we might say that reconnaissance
administered not a medicinal dose of truth, but rather "a lie that makes
us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  Picasso said this of art, and of cubism in particular; his recognition
  of the provisional nature of realizable "truth" has the syntax of
  an afterthought, but insofar as it acknowledges the contingency of
  perception, it articulates a generative condition of both cubism
  and Great War reconnaissance. I have described this condition above
  as the culmination of a nineteenth-century antiocularcentrism in
  physiological optics, epistemology, and aesthetic production, a
  current of thought crystallized in the parlor stereoscope. By 1907
  this deconsecration of vision and visual metaphors had been more
  recently emphasized by Nietzsche and Bergson, who helped bring about
  what Martin Jay has schematized as a threefold revision of vision:
  the detranscendentalization of perspective, the recorporealization
  of the cognitive subject, and the revalorization of time over space
  (<i>DE,</i> 187). Though aerial reconnaissance might be assumed to
  reject any such deconsecration of ocular proof, we have seen that
  instead it capitalized on decentered optics and temporal parallax. And
  though cubism certainly responded to antiocular epistemology, it often

<b></b>

did so in surprisingly eye-minded ways, preserving at least the metaphor
of stereopsis in attempting to tell the story of depth, if never quite
to reproduce its effects. In fact, by projecting onto a single picture
plane many facets of an object not simultaneously visible to the eye
(tops next to bottoms, backs adjacent to fronts), cubism made its own bid
to see beneath bridges, to provide a total reconnaissance cover of its
objects. To regard cubism as exclusively encryptive, and reconnaissance
as exclusively decryptive, then, would be to install both within the
very positivist, cryptological syntax whose rejection they embodied.

<p>
Early accounts of cubism described the movement as reckoning in new ways
with an old problem: the impossibility of inducing natural stereopsis
from within a two-dimensional pictorial space.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The parlor stereoscope had provided one solution to this problem; but
  even it could not induce the viewer's eyes to converge and accommodate
  differently at separate depth planes within the fused image, with the
  unlifelike result that foreground, middleground, and background depth
  planes in a stereogram are all simultaneously in focus. In taking
  up this problem, cubism might be described as a second-generation
  stereoscopy, trading optical illusionism in for other techniques of
  suggesting, narrating, or inflicting depth. In 1912, two prominent
  cubist painters, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, undertook in their
  essay <i>Cubism</i> to defend and publicize the movement, and above
  all to begin a process of reeducation, one that would address "the
  difficulty which even a sensible and cultivated public experiences in
  reading modern works." Heretofore, they argued, the public had only
  been looking at cubist paintings through the retina. But cubism had
  from the start been cognizant of the flatness of the picture plane,
  utterly dispensing with the notion that a painting acted as a window
  looking out onto Cartesian space. Such a recognition confronted the
  limitations of retinal perception for painting, not the least of
  which being that in the single depth plane of pictorial space, the
  reflex of focal accommodation to different depth planes was mooted,
  and thus "the convergence which perspective teaches us to represent
  cannot evoke the idea of depth." Since even a painstaking reproduction
  of perspectival dimensions and proportions failed to convey depth,
  painters had to resort to more distortive means of conveying "the
  fictitious depths in which the co-ordinative light resides":
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Let us imagine a landscape. The width of the river, the thickness of the
foliage, and the height of the banks, the dimensions of each object and
the relations of these dimensions&#8212;these are secure guarantees. Well,
if we find these intact upon the canvas, we shall have learned nothing as
to the talent or the genius of the painter. River, foliage, and banks,
despite a conscientious representation to scale, no longer "tell" by
virtue of their width, thickness, and height, or the relations between
these dimensions. Torn from natural space, they have entered a different
kind of space, which does not assimilate the proportion observed. This
remains an external matter. It has just so much importance as a catalogue
number, or a title at the bottom of a picture frame. . . . The painter has
the power of rendering as enormous things that we regard as infinitesimal,
and as infinitesimal things that we know to be considerable; he changes
quantity into quality. [<i>C,</i> 25-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



With the stereoptic reflexes annulled by pictorial space, the painter
could compensate by distorting the dimensions of natural space in such a
way that they would once again "tell" as depth&#8212;i.e., by a variation
on hyperstereopsis. Painters also had recourse to "tactile and motor
sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality
which, contracting or dilating, transforms the plane of the picture. As
in reacting this plane reflects the personality upon the understanding
of the spectator, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage
between two subjective spaces" (<i>C,</i> 29-30).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  It is no longer the iris alone, but the whole personality that
  contracts or dilates. Reimagined here as a synesthetic perceptual
  organ, the new spectator would open his or her whole sensorium to
  the painting even as the painter had done; painter and spectator
  would collaborate in the creation of a pictorial space through the
  fusion, not of two sightlines, but of two subjectivities. Despite its
  antiocularcentrism and its insistence that painters are not geometers,
  <i>Cubism</i> retains stereopsis, or rather hyperstereopsis, as its
  master trope, widening its parallactic baseline from an interocular to
  an intersubjective distance. Gleizes and Metzinger even conferred a
  variant of stereoptic fusion on cubist painting. Confident that even
  "the least intelligent" painters and spectators would eventually
  recalibrate their perceptual habits in accordance with cubist
  hyperstereoperception, they forecast a day when "the fact of moving
  around an object to seize several successive appearances, which,
  fused in a single image, reconstitute it in time, will no longer make
  thoughtful people indignant." Meanwhile, they declared, cubist forms
  must remain "sufficiently remote from the imagination of the vulgar to
  prevent the truth which they convey from assuming a general character,"
  and cubism must continue to "employ its own language, in order to
  move, dominate, and direct the crowd, not in order to be understood"
  (<i>C,</i> 54-5, 24, 62).

<p>
The notion that the serial glances constituting a cubist painting could
"fuse in a single image," as if with a sudden stereoscopic clarity,
seems questionable given the sense of irretrievable dispersal conveyed by
much cubist work. Besides, Gleizes and Metzinger seem here to describe
the painter's, rather than the spectator's, fusion of a series of
"appearances" onto a single image plane. But in other accounts of cubism,
an experience very like stereoscopic fusion is clearly attributed to the
spectator. In his <i>Rise of Cubism</i> , Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler,
one of the movement's key exhibitors and dealers, likened cubism to
"stereometric drawing on the plane," adding that it can present "an
analytical study of [an] object which the spectator then fuses into one
again in his mind." Though Kahnweiler conceded that the fusion may lack
the "closed manner of the stereometric drawing," he nonetheless bestowed
on that more "open" fusion the same ontological status as the stereoscopic
image: "there exists, as well, but only in the mind of the spectator,
the finished product of the assimilation, the human head, for instance."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  This "assimilation," he added, could be assisted through a painting's
  titular reference to familiar objects, mention of which would summon
  catalytic memory images in the spectator:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Naturally, with this, as with any new mode of expression in painting,
the assimilation which leads to seeing the represented things objectively
does not immediately take place

<b></b>

when the spectator is unfamiliar with the new language. But for lyric
painting to fulfill its purpose completely, it must be more than just a
pleasure to the eye of the spectator. To be sure, assimilation always
takes place finally, but in order to facilitate it, and impress its
urgency upon the spectator, Cubist pictures should always be provided
with descriptive titles, such as <i>Bottle and Glass</i>, <i>Playing
Cards and Dice</i> and so on. In this way, the condition will arise which
H. G. Lewes [<i>sic</i>] referred to as "preperception" and memory images
connected with the title will then focus much more easily on the stimuli
in the painting. [<i>RC,</i> 12-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The painting could further facilitate the spectator's "assimilation"
by including recognizable details&#8212;clues, such as domestic
objects or personal effects, that could help establish the scale,
location, and orientation of its subject. Picasso's 1910 portrait
<i>Daniel-HenryKahnweiler</i> (<a href="10.2saint_res.html#1" name="1"> 11</a>), a celebrated example of
analytical cubism, offsets its defamiliarizing gestures with details
such as the subject's watch-chain, a bottle and glass, a table, and a
piece of New Caledonian sculpture. Like the materiality and familiarity
of its work titles, the cubist detail suggests the movement's residual
engagement with more conventionally realist forms of representation, and
its odd proximity to the detail-obsessed, decryptive, and denominative
operations of reconnaissance. And as with reconnaissance, Kahnweiler
insisted that despite cubism's concessions to the familiar, its spectators
must, in the name of "urgency," relearn perception, becoming familiar
with the movement's "new language" and enlisting their memories of
more conventional perceptual acts in order to "assimilate" the cubist
image. Viewers who misconstrued cubism as "Geometric Art" did so, he
said, because geometry was the only memory image they could connect with
the paintings. That misperception would end "as soon as the spectator
familiarizes himself with the new method of expression and gains in
perception" (<i>RC,</i> 13).

<p>
As they did in reconnaissance discourse, such prescriptions for
a reeducated spectator served social as well as perceptual ends in
the reception of cubism. Like Kahnweiler, Picasso likened cubism to a
language that only some people understood: "The fact that for a long
time Cubism has not been understood and that even today there are people
who cannot see anything in it, means nothing. I do not read English, an
English book is a blank book to me. This does not mean that the English
language does not exist, and why should I blame anybody else but myself
if I cannot understand what I know nothing about?"
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  By equating the viewing of a painting with various forms of
  translation&#8212;from one language to another, from optical
  dispersal to assimilation, from lies to "the truth that is given us
  to understand"&#8212;such directives made a two-way toggle switch
  of the spectator's understanding. As a result, they conferred an
  elite identity on those spectators who could answer one question in
  the affirmative: "Do you <i>get it</i>?" Thus, however much Great
  War <i>camoufleurs</i> like de Sc&eacute;vola may seem to have
  misappropriated cubism as a straightforwardly encryptive resource,
  one finds that the dichotomous logic of camouflage was immanent within
  cubist self-representation from the start, and furthermore that cubism
  partly contracted that logic from the stereoscope, only a subset of
  whose users could gain access to the "fictitious depths" latent in its
  flat images. Along with the gatekeeping question as to its spectators'

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 375]</b>

understanding, cubism also issued them a series of implicit dares, all
of which point up both its adversarial tendencies and its homologies
with Great War reconnaissance: can you either recover the subject named
by the image from its defamiliarized form, or find the irrecuperable
estrangement of that subject pleasurable, legitimate, interesting, or
important? Will you assimilate work titles like <i>Still Life</i> and
<i>Woman with Pears</i>, commonly found in more conventional contexts,
in their reapplication to a seemingly violent dismemberment of the old
optical order the titles ask you to remember? Will you be able to achieve
a fusion of such paintings and their titles, perceptually unifying those
two disparate informational fields? How far will you go in retraining
yourself either to see anew, or to assent to not-seeing as a nobler,
worthier, harder, or more contemporary act of perception?


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Open Fusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
From two spectacularly different vantages, the conscripted gazes
of the reconnaissance observer and the cubist spectator converged
in a single scopic regime. Both were asked to gaze on conspicuously
flat image spaces and endeavor, through retraining their perceptual
coordinates and reflexes, to produce a "fusion" or "assimilation"
in the mind that would reveal objects in "fictitious depths" that were
both deeper and more overtly fictitious than the conventions of Cartesian
perspectivalism. This fictitious depth was constituted not only of spatial
parallax, but of temporal as well: the cubist painting projected a series
of glimpses onto a single canvas, while aerial hyperstereoscopy allowed
a simultaneous fusion of stereopairs shot in sequence; both constructed a
mobile rather than a fixed observer in relation to the observed. Like the
parlor stereoscope of which they were rival offspring, cubism and aerial
stereoscopy depicted an object in such a way as to make it seem the more
present for being the result of a differential effect that took place,
if it took place at all, nowhere but in the mind of the observer. They
required their observers to earn that impression of presence, along with
its conceit of providing a three-dimensional cover (seeing under bridges
from above, say, or behind forward-facing <i>demoiselles</i>), through
an arduous perceptual reeducation, one that forced them to confront the
contingency of scalar stability, depth perception, normal dimension,
and ultimately the coexistence and interpenetration of different spatial
orders. But as a reward for that reeducation, they promised to admit the
observer into an elite made up of those who "understood." Obviously cubism
and Great War reconnaissance bore very different relations to physical
violence, the latter being explicitly involved in planning, facilitating,
and confirming destruction. But the chief site of that destruction
proved the most hospitable climate for cubist painting during the war
years: although its reputation suffered amid the formal conservatism of
patriotic Paris, cubism thrived at the front. There, soldier-painters
such as Fernand L&eacute;ger, Andr&eacute; Fraye, Albert Gleizes, and
Andr&eacute; Mar&eacute; used cubist analytical syntax to represent the
real destruction they were now helping to fend off and to wreak.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Although this essay has juxtaposed the observer constructed by Great
War reconnaissance with the corresponding re in cubist painting,
other pairings suggest themselves. To begin with, stereopsis has long been
understood as integral to the rative and philosophical vocabularies of
much modernist literature. The differential optics of parallax undergird
meditations on both epistemology and ethics in Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>,
a text that also asks to be read stereoptically, challenging
its readers to fuse Homeric and contemporary narratives without
conflating them, remaining mindful of how each narrative consecrates
or desecrates, distorts, rectifies, or relativizes the other. Woolf's
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is structured around a stereopsis of class and
gender, pairing the upper-class Clarissa with the petit-bourgeois Great
War veteran Septimus&#8212;characters who, like stereopairs, are kept
adjacent but separate, throwing one another into relief. Roger Shattuck
has described the chronotope of Proust's <i>&Agrave; la recherche du
temps perdu</i> as binocular in its abandonment of motion for the relief
effects achieved by juxtaposing arrested, temporally disjunct moments.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  In all three cases, however, one notes that the conspicuously broad
  separations between various conceptual stereopairs&#8212;separations
  in class, gender, genre, time, and space&#8212;suggest not the subtle
  interocular distance and simultaneity of parlor stereograms, but the
  more considerable spatial and temporal intervals, the self-conscious
  distortion, and the equivocal interpretive mandates of reconnaissance
  hyperstereoscopy. The stereoptic preoccupations of such texts might be
  revisited in the context of a second-generation stereoptic regime,
  one distinct from nineteenth-century stereoscopy in its use of
  scalar manipulation and industrialized image production, in its
  role as the perceptual component of an integrated weapons system,
  and in its conflicted claims about its own simultaneously realist
  and illusionist powers.

<p>
In other registers, too, reconnaissance optics and rhetoric were
homologous with a whole series of gestures that have come to seem
characteristic of many interwar modernisms. As Great War reconnaissance
did with aerial photography and the stereoscope, modernist texts tended
to recombine nineteenth-century representational technologies, but
within hyperbolized contexts that insisted on the interdependence of
representation and destruction. They foregrounded the extent to which
conventions of documenting the real are constructed by strategic and
compensatory exaggerations that become naturalized, even normativized,
over time. While indulging frequently in fantasies of comprehensive
and totalizing representation, they also illustrated the dependence
of such fantasies upon site-specific, partial, relativistic acts of
perception. They further shifted the function of reading and viewing
away from the veridical category of "vision" to "<i>a</i> vision," the
expression of a lone artist whose worldview was so radically eccentric
as to invalidate former ways of reading and seeing. Having nullified
the usefulness of precedent, they asked their viewers or readers to
engage in extravagant acts of rediscipline and reeducation, to devote a
lifetime not just to studying, but to "studying under" a singular text
or artifact (e.g., <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, <i>Ulysses</i> and
<i>Finnegans Wake</i>, the <i>Cantos</i>, Duchamp's <i>Large Glass</i>
with its unique physics).
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  They thereby created, and in several cases plainly set out to create,
  elite corps of interpreters devoted to exceeding the standards of
  mere accuracy in extracting meaning

<b></b>

from every detail in a semiotic field. In doing so, they activated the
oppositional dynamics of encryption/decryption, presenting themselves
as puzzles for their interpreters to solve through perseverance,
resourcefulness, collaboration, and the development of new interpretive
protocols and technologies. This oppositional relationship recast the
artist in a manner largely peculiar to the twentieth century: as an
adversary whose occulted intentions the observer set out to fathom
by decoding, identifying, and interrelating objects in a textual or
perceptual domain, using exaggerative theoretical optics and interpretive
trigonometry to take the measure of those objects by the light of social
forces external to the artist's control. And by calling for interpretive
schools whose work was inseparably devotional <i>and</i> adversarial,
they helped catalyze the relation of ambivalence that is characteristic
of much twentieth-century critical discourse toward its objects, a
stance in which affection and aggression seem inextricably knotted,
even mutually constitutive.

<p>
This last series of claims will seem to make a totalizing gesture of
its own, one in which the technical, rhetorical, and social dynamics of
Great War reconnaissance are put forward as the key to all modernist
mythologies. This is certainly not the aim of this essay, which seeks
rather to juxtapose two disjunct images of a culture wrestling with
the predication of totality on locality, partiality, contingency. If
these two images appear to fuse into an integrated concept, that
concept is none other than the recognition of any totalizing system
as illusionist, as possessed of decryptive or explanatory powers
only in proportion as it exaggeratively dubs "real," "natural,"
"infallible," or "total" observations that it knows to be vulnerably
site-specific. To bring a remote object out of flatness, the critic,
like the observer, overcompensates: seeing it in any legible depth is
the result of distortion&#8212;a falsified conflation or a distended
separation of moments, spaces, gazes, discourses, epistemes. Yet this
counterdistortion neither restores nor presupposes the dimensions
of the real with any certainty, because the process of mapping the
pathways of critical stereopsis reveals what formerly were "normal"
dimensions to be "a normal," a highly contingent baseline rather
than a fixed cardinal point. If the veridical notion of "vision" has,
in the process, been forsaken for the more eccentric criterion of "a
vision," the critic-observer hopes to recuperate in tactical advantage
what has been lost in the waning&#8212;or sacrifice&#8212;of ocular
proof, stable notions of the natural, and the fantastic certainty of
a God's-eye view. A critical overview of modernist reconnaissance,
if it is sufficiently attentive to its subject, will have schooled its
observer to be circumspect about its own final, panoramic observation:
that aerial hyperstereoscopy was paradigmatic of the dominant status of
the observer in the early twentieth century.

<p>
Writing during the late 1930s of cubism and the airplane view of
America, Gertrude Stein was performing her own act of modernist cultural
reconnaissance. Two radically separate high-altitude stereopairs lay
beneath her lenses: on one side, a long-expired avant-garde movement;
on the other, a technologically sponsored view of the earth that cubism's
key exponents had never, to her knowledge, seen firsthand. The respective
images&#8212;after all, rather flattened versions of cubism and early
aerial perspective&#8212;were both spatially and temporally disjunct,
occupying different discursive spaces

<b></b>

and historical moments. Stein's prose juggles the stereopairs about,
uncertain whether they line up in a relation of causality, and if
so, which way that causality flows. If the two images can be said to
fuse, they do so in the elusive but suggestive notion that creators
are supercontemporary: that they are people who simply and instantly
intuit the epoch-making changes their contemporaries must register in the
fullness of time. The rhetorical majesty with which the idea is expressed
belies the spatial and temporal contingency of which it is the special
effect. Yet the illusory nature of Stein's synthesis is nothing against
its persuasive force among students of modernism, whom it has repeatedly
"come right up and hit" as a crucial formulation. That quality of being at
once theatrically distortive and revealingly (or revoltingly) accurate is
characteristic of many modernisms, and many interpretive theories about
modernism. So are the stakes concealed by this hallucinatory realism:
namely, an observer of "splendors" whose aesthetic power is indissolubly
bound not only to the potential destruction of the object but also to the
violent perceptual and ethical redisciplining of the observer. Such an
observer could experience both the annihilation of the represented object
and the trials and spectacle of her own retraining&#8212;as Stein does in
her conclusion to <i>Picasso</i>, and as Powys-Lybbe did in her wartime
reunion with the stereoscope&#8212;as unalloyed aspects of "splendor."

The Englishman Charles Wheatstone, one of the inventors of the
stereoscope, had been among the first to posit a physiological reason for
this impossibility: "When the painting and the object are seen with both
eyes, in the case of the painting two similar objects are projected on the
retinas, in the case of the solid object the pictures are dissimilar;
there is therefore an essential difference between the impressions
on the organs of sensation in the two cases, and consequently between
the perceptions formed in the mind; the painting therefore cannot be
confounded with the solid object." Charles Wheatstone, "Contributions to
the Physiology of Vision," in <i>Brewster and Wheatstone on Vision</i>,
ed. Nicholas J. Wade (London: Academic Press, 1983), 66.
