Though little remarked since its occurrence, an event that took place
on 7 October 1915 in New York city bears considerable significance for
our understanding of the rapport between the historical avant-garde and
modern commodity culture. On that day the Modern Gallery, located at 500
Fifth Avenue, opened its doors for its first exhibition. Created by Marius
de Zayas, Francis Picabia, Agnes Ernst Meyer, and other young members of
Alfred Stieglitz's 291 entourage, the Modern Gallery was conceived of as
the commercial "expression" of the famous "spirit of 291." That firmly
avant-garde res such as de Zayas and Picabia would feel Stieglitz's
pioneering modern art venue required an openly commercial off-shoot may
seem strange, since current consensus tells us that such artists ought
to have sardonically opposed the commodification of the art object, or at
least been highly ambivalent on the subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 But of course the
strangeness of this development is precisely why it is worth recounting
and analyzing. The story of how the commercial Modern Gallery emerged
out of the declining anti-commercialism of Stieglitz's Little Galleries
of the Photo Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue offers key insights into the
surprisingly optimistic nature of the avant-garde's engagement with the
modern fact of commodification and the powerful attraction exerted by
machine-age American commodity culture on the aesthetic and institutional
imaginations of both European and American avant-garde artists of the
time. The fact of this attraction to commodity culture puts into question
the widely held belief that the historical avant-garde sought to change
"life" through "art": in New York, avant-garde artists sought artistic
direction 
<b></b>
from the machine-age life around them, so that "art"
was shaped by "life"--both in aesthetics and its institutional arenas;
for res such as de Zayas and Picabia, the primary motivation behind
the artistic and institutional work of the New York avant-garde was the
desire to be absolutely contemporary with, rather than in opposition
to, modern society as emblematized by New York's commodity culture.

<P>
The Modern Gallery opened within the context of Alfred Stieglitz's
decline as pioneering avant-garde impresario and institution builder
and the contemporaneous expansion of the market for modernist art in
New York. Stieglitz's magazine <I>Camera Work</I> and his 291 gallery
came to an end in the summer of 1917 after a steady decline in activity
that began just after the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern
Art, known as the Armory Show. Though scholars have offered numerous
reasons for this decline, the primary one is the failure of Stieglitz's
long-standing anti-commercial strategy for coping with post-Armory Show
modernist art market expansion. That strategy was now replaced by another
advanced by the de Zayas-Picabia group, one much better adapted to the
post-Armory Show atmosphere because of its optimistic belief that art's
commodification could afford the avant-garde the opportunity to "pay its
own way" as a contemporary expression of the energies animating modern
American society.

<P>
<I>Camera Work</I>, originally a quarterly, appeared sporadically after
the Armory show until, from the summer of 1914 to its final number in
June 1917, only three slim issues appeared. When it ceased publication it
had only thirty-eight subscribers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 During this same period,
Stieglitz became far less active in his pursuit of significant new
artists for exhibition at 291. Showings centered primarily on works by
artists already familiar to the 291 public, such as John Marin, Marsden
Hartley, and Abraham Walkowitz; significant ground-breaking exhibitions
at 291 were organized not by Stieglitz but by the younger de Zayas. (De
Zayas was a Mexican-American caricaturist and collector who established
contacts between 291 and members of the Parisian avant-garde, particularly
those associated with Guillaume Apollinaire's review <I>Les Soir&eacute;es
de Paris;</I> his expositions at 291 included the "African Savage Art"
show of 1914 and the U.S. debut of Italian Futurist Gino Severini in
1917.) Even the two notable debuts that Stieglitz himself arranged--the
1916 debut of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the photographer Paul Strand,
and Georgia O'Keefe's debut the following year--testify to a turn in
the period following the Armory Show from his previous emphasis on both
American and European modern art to a nativist focus on American art
alone, especially American art originating within the 291 circle.

<P>
Stieglitz scholars have typically explained this decline in activity
by refering to developments in his personal life: in 1917 Steiglitz
was fifty-three, in serious debt, and tired from fourteen years of
publishing <I>Camera Work</I> and nine years of operating 291 (<I>SMB,</I>
127). While these no doubt contributed to Stieglitz's withdrawal, the
primary reason for his retreat from his position as New York's foremost
champion of the international avant-garde was the awkward double bind in
which he found himself after the Armory Show. While the show confirmed
his visionary, truly avant-garde 
<b></b>
stature as a crusader for modern
art, its popularization of that art paradoxically ensured that his
vision was no longer unique. As William I. Homer notes, between 1913
and 1917, "291 [came to be] rivaled by the Daniel, Carroll, Washington
Square (later Coady), Montross, and Bourgeois galleries, along with The
Modern Gallery." Further, several clubs and exhibition societies put on
important exhibits in these years, while avant-garde journals such as
<I>The Seven Arts</I> and <I>The Soil</I> came to occupy territory that
had previously been <I>Camera Work</I>'s exclusive domain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

Stieglitz, despite the expansion of the New York modern art scene,
failed to gain new subscribers to the journal or substantially increase
attendance at 291.

<P>
Why did Stieglitz interpret the evident success of his vision as a
loss of uniqueness, and what relation did this have to his inability
to attract more attention? The question is important. Stieglitz, after
all, might have viewed this loss of exclusivity as the affirmation of
his originality. But in his view the expanding popularity of modernist
art was driven by fashion on the mass level and investment strategies
at the level of collecting and dealing. It betrayed the "spirit of
291." Stieglitz wanted people to admire the work "in terms of spiritual
force, not as a material commodity," and at times he would complain,
"Work isn't art until enough noise is made about it, until someone rich
comes along and buys it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 His legendary anti-commercialism,
often portrayed as eccentric or amusing before the Armory Show, was now
putting him in danger of being left behind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>


<P>
Stieglitz made one last effort to adapt his aesthetic idealism and the
institutions he had developed according to that idealism to the booming
war-time avant-garde art scene. It occurred in the years 1915-1916
in the form of a dual experiment: first, Stieglitz agreed to be a
partner in the publication of an avant-garde review called <I>291</I>,
proposed by Paul Haviland, Marius de Zayas, and Agnes Meyer; and second,
he consented to connect his anti-commercial 291 gallery with Marius
de Zayas's openly commercial Modern Gallery. This episode within the
history of 291 demonstrates a larger, important historical shift in the
institutional structure supporting modernist art in America. This shift
was from an aesthetic and institutional framework of values grounded in
a notion of the sanctity of the act of creation and the object created,
and the artist's privilege to select an audience, to another framework
that involves a satirical, transgressive attitude towards this idealized
sanctity and a more ambivalent and de-personalized relationship between
artist and public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The latter framework did not, of course,
replace the former once and for all at a discrete moment in history;
but it became more vital and, correspondingly, more visible in the New
York art world during and immediately after the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The
idealists, like Stieglitz, remained a strong presence, but no longer held
the authoritative leadership role they had once occupied; their elitist
vision of the role of modern art in American society could not recover
fully from the attack it had sustained from the anti-idealist aesthetic.

<P>
In the final pages of the October 1916 issue of <I>Camera Work</I>,
Stieglitz announces at one and the same time the undertaking of the
<I>291</I>/Modern Gallery experiment 
<b></b>
and its results.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

Under the title "'291' and The Modern Gallery," he reprints the
announcement--first published in the October 1915 issue of <I>291</I>
(no.9)--of the 7 October 1915 opening of the Modern Gallery. The
reprinted announcement states that the Modern Gallery would in no
way alter the famous "spirit" of 291: "The Modern Gallery is but an
additional expression of '291.'" After the reprinted announcement,
Stieglitz reports that it had originally been planned to distribute
a circular, one that would explain in greater detail the relationship
between the two galleries and the reasons for creating the new gallery,
but that it had been "withheld because '291' felt it owed no explanations
to anyone, and the above [announcement] was substituted in its stead." It
is important to note, if only in passing, that this substitution, the
insistence on the quasi-scientific nature of this "experiment," and
the article's overall tone of hostile reticence constitute a refusal to
engage in promotional advertising.

<P>
Now, however, in October 1916, several months since The Modern Gallery
and 291 have parted ways, Stieglitz has decided that "the course of
events necessitates a recording in <I>Camera Work</I> [of] the genesis
of the Modern Gallery." He publishes the withheld circular, laying out
the hypothesis behind the experiment--that the post-Armory show climate
might be favorable to avant-garde commercial success--and then reports
the results:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Mr. De Zayas, after experimenting for three months on the lines
contemplated, found that practical business in New York and '291'
were incompatible. In consequence he suggested that '291' and the
Modern Gallery be separated. The suggestion automatically constituted
a separation.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Despite Stieglitz's matter-of-fact tone, it is obvious from the content
of the reprinted circular and from what we know about how Stieglitz ran
291 that the actual reason for the separation had to do with Stieglitz's
anti-commericalism. As stated in the circular, the most important goal in
opening The Modern Gallery was to enable artists (those of the 291 circle
and, especially, Europeans suffering from Europe's collapsed war-time
art market) to make a living from their work--to "pay their own way,"
as de Zayas was fond of saying. This goal may sound unremarkable, since
the primary purpose of galleries since the 19th century has been to turn
a profit for artists and gallery owners. But within the context of 291,
the sole venue for international modern art in America up to this period,
it signalled a radical change of direction. Prior to the Armory Show,
Stieglitz had done little to promote the sale of work of the 291 circle
because he saw his role as spiritual nurturer of creative genius, not
as dealer. True art, according to Stieglitz, is created as a composite
spiritual and scientific search for truth that cannot be compromised by
conventions of taste imposed by the marketplace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>


<P>
Sometimes Stieglitz did allow his painters to sell their work, but only
if the transaction was completed without regard for market conventions:
Stieglitz believed that to remain aesthetically pure, the artist ought
never to allow the anticipation of a sale to play a role in the creation
of a work (<I>SMB,</I> 132). Specific commissions were thus 
<b></b>
ruled
out, though Stieglitz often secured loans for painters like Hartley,
Marin, and Dove against their future production.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 According
to observers, when an exhibition viewer proposed the purchase of a work,
Stieglitz scrutinized the would be owner in order to determine whether he
was worthy of the work. Worthiness was conferred only if the prospective
purchaser could convince Stieglitz he was unable to live without the piece
(<I>LL,</I> 134; <I>AS,</I> 259; <I>HWW,</I> 81). The slightest hint of
a speculative interest might cause Stieglitz to double the price of the
work. After 1913 Stieglitz became even more anti-commercial as he learned
of the dishonest business practices of some of the New York galleries
that sprang up after the Armory Show (<I>AS,</I> 173; <I>ASAS,</I> 119).

<P>
De Zayas's intention with the Modern Gallery was to end the economic
suffering of the 291 artists caused by the combination of Stieglitz's
anti-commercial institutional philosophy and other galleries' "dishonest
commercialism"; the solution was to "bring the producers of these works
. . . into business touch with the purchasing public on terms of mutual
justice and mutual self-respect."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 De Zayas and his partners
felt that if 291 were to remain artistically alive, it would have to
"evolve" as an institution with respect to the larger contemporary network
of economic and industrial relations that composed the post-Armory Show
art world and, indeed, machine-age American life in general. They did
not share Stieglitz's view that such an evolution would lead inevitably
to the corruption of an artist's originality or genius:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We feel that the phase of our work which has resulted in arousing
an interest in contemporary art in America has reached a point
where, if it is to fulfill itself, it must undertake the affirmative
solution of a problem which it has already negatively solved. We have
already demonstrated that it is possible to avoid commercialism by
eliminating it. But this demonstration will be infertile unless it be
followed by another: namely, that the legitimate function of commercial
intervention--that of paying its own way while bringing the producers and
consumers of art into a relation of mutual service--can be freed from the
chicanery of self-seeking. . . . It is the purpose of the Modern Gallery
to further, by these means, the development of contemporary art both here
and abroad, and to pay its own way by reasonable charges.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Modern Gallery was thus conceived as a commercial and intellectual
center where the New York public, with its new post-Armory show
consciousness about modern art, could bridge the previously existing
gulf between contemporary art and American society (<I>HWW,</I> 93,
191). This new consciousness, characterized by an urban cultural vision
common to artist and public, made possible "a relation of mutual justice
and mutual self-respect" between artist and New York public.

<P>
Stieglitz consented to compromise his ideals and enter into association
with the Modern Gallery mostly out of concern for the economic security
of his artist friends
<BR>
--severely over-extended, he was barely able to continue paying
out the stipends he had for some time been distributing to the 291
artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 These practical concerns, however, could not
outweigh his profound disgust for business talk, which made up too much
of the atmosphere at the Modern Gallery for his taste. In late December
of 1915, Stieglitz broke off the relationship between 291 and the Modern
Gallery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 
<b></b>


<P>
Such financial and interpersonal differences form the surface of what was
really a much deeper disagreement between the two parties concerning the
relationship between modernist artists and American society. Stieglitz
took an elitist stance, arguing that there was an essential intellectual
gulf between advanced modern artists and the lagging society around them,
while de Zayas posited the contemporaneity of artist and public. The two
sides demonstrated these opposing views in their respective aesthetic
and institutional philosophies.

<P>
Stieglitz's ideas about the relationship between modern art and
American society are in their most consistent form European secessionist
ideas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What makes Stieglitz unique is that he held these
secessionist ideas in tandem with strong opinions about the role for
representation in modernist, post-photography painting. As an alternative
to the academic tradition of juried salon shows and its accompanying
notions of taste and propriety, Stieglitz created an independent
group, the Photo-Secession, which was devoted to photography based upon
self-generated standards formed through independent-minded criticism in
magazines such as his <I>Camera Notes</I> and <I>Camera Work</I>. The work
produced was displayed in non-juried shows held in independent spaces such
as his Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession. This path had been blazed
by the French Impressionists and other Independents, and by the German
and Austrian Secessionists, in the second half of the nineteenth century
(<I>LL,</I> 128; <I>ASP,</I> 52; <I>SMA,</I> 129-130).
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

But because Stieglitz believed that photography, when properly done, ought
to be considered of the same artistic stature as the plastic arts, he
went beyond nineteenth century secessionism. In particular, his belief
that sharp-focus pictorial photography was at the very least equal in
artistic value to realistic representation in painting went hand-in-hand
with his belief that the abstract, non-representational aesthetics of
modern European art were the key to new discoveries in human thought and
imagination. 291 and <I>Camera Work</I> were to be unique laboratories
in which Americans could observe the latest advances and experiments in
both objective (through photography exhibits) and subjective (through
exhibits of modernist art) thought and artistic expression. Stieglitz's
unique understanding of the relationship between photography and plastic
art thus enabled him almost single-handedly to revolutionize the American
art world in a way that his anti-academic contemporaries the Progressives,
including the Ash Can school artists, had been unable to do. The Armory
Show ratified Stieglitz's revolutionary and technology-based embrace
of non-representational art, making plain to the public the enormous
difference in aesthetic sophistication between the American Progressives
and European modernists like Picasso, Braque, Matisse, and Duchamp
(<I>ASAS,</I> 241).

<P>
In pre-Armory Show New York, the art Stieglitz showed at 291 was
so new and, frequently, incomprehensible to the public (and often to
Stieglitz and members of the 291 circle themselves) that, institutionally
speaking, it was beyond the bounds of even the existing independent art
market. The institutional support for such art could not, therefore,
depend principally upon sales. Stieglitz used terms like "the spirit of
291" as shorthand to refer to the way in which he connected original
artists 
<b></b>
such as Marin, Hartley, Dove, Walkowitz, Picabia, and
O'Keefe, among others, with the monetary support of the few patrons and
collectors of avant-garde art in America at the time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The
manner in which 291 as an institution connected artists and art works
with a supportive public exemplifies the fact that the genesis of this
period's economic market for modernist art was never grounded in simple
economics; it was always to a great extent based in a mystical faith
in experimentation as a sign of progress towards artistic truth, and
thus relied upon decidedly uneconomic ways of thinking. Individuals who
patronized the artists of 291 idealized notions of craftsmanship and
creative genius, and the atmosphere of 291 served as a referent for those
ideals, a place where, through the work and talk of the community gathered
there, a unique truth seemed to come into existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In such
an atmosphere the artists and art objects took on a composite sacred and
scientific aura that separated them from and rendered them superior to
the outside culture's values of popularity and/or commercial success.

<P>
I am using the word "aura" to describe the atmosphere for
avant-garde/modernist art Stieglitz created at 291 because I want to take
issue with the way this term has been used to describe the intentions of
the historical avant-garde ever since Benjamin first used it in his essay
"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." B&uuml;rger and
Huyssen have refined the term, eliminating its faulty "pseudomaterialist"
account of cause and effect: abandoning Benjamin's base-superstructure
model, they emphasize instead the historical avant-garde artist's
conscious intention to destroy the aura of his works, noting that
the mechanical means for doing so often didn't even exist at the time
(<I>TAG,</I> 34; <I>AGD,</I> 10). But avant-garde and modernist art in
New York raises problems for this use of the term, insofar as Stieglitz
completely contradicts Benjamin's theory, even in its refined form:
Stieglitz was an avant-garde re who at one and the same time
devoted himself to the artistic use of the latest technology, both in
photography and printing, yet was a firm believer in the modernist artist
as genius-creator of works of transcendental power valued for their
originality, authenticity, craftsmanship, and, unsurprisingly, ultimate
incomprehensibility. Describing Stieglitz's attitude, de Zayas wrote:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It would be a mistake to think that Stieglitz's purpose and objective
was to make people understand modern art. . . . Stieglitz believed
and had faith in something he did not know and had he known it, he
would not have believed in it. . . . The exhibitions of modern art and
pictorial photography were only the flesh and bones of the 'Spirit [of
291]' for everybody to see but only for the very few selected ones to
understand. . . . In Stieglitz's hands modern art had transcendental
value. [<I>HWW,</I> 84-85]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Benjamin's opposition between mass-produced machine or print reproduction
on the one hand and artistic authenticity on the other never occured
to Stieglitz.

<P>
In using the term "aura" to describe the atmosphere at the undeniably
avant-garde 291, I want to show how the standard emphasis on the
destruction of aura as the most significant accomplishment of
the avant-garde obscures a more important 
<b></b>
issue, that of the
avant-garde's desire for contemporaneity. The significance of the clash
between Stieglitz's aesthetic and institutional philosophy and the de
Zayas-Picabia aesthetic and institutional philosophy lies not so much in
what it reveals about the avant-garde's desire to destroy (bourgeois)
art's aura as in the belief on the part of de Zayas and Picabia that
Stieglitz's brand of avant-gardism was preventing modernist art from
becoming fully contemporary with American society. The perceived
need for the Modern Gallery grew out of the sense that the role of
machines in American life revealed something about American culture's
quintessential modernity. Given a truly modern society, then, de Zayas,
following Picabia, believed that artists in America needed only to
find the appropriate aesthetic and institutional form to express this
modernity. Once they had found the proper form, they would produce work
worthy of the time and milieu. What I am describing, then, is actually
the inverse of B&uuml;rger's claim that, historically, "the intention
of the avant-gardiste may be defined as the attempt to direct toward
the practical the aesthetic experience (which rebels against the praxis
of life) that Aestheticism developed" (<I>TAG,</I> 34). As will become
apparent, American commodity culture became the standard of modernity
against which the post-Armory show New York avant-garde measured its
work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P>
Stieglitz's post-Armory Show turn inward to emphasize purity and aesthetic
idealism at 291 indicates that he felt that the popularity of modern art
generated by the show had disrupted and undermined this faith in an aura
of truth surrounding the 291 art works and their creators (<I>AS,</I>
173). The event that confirmed Stieglitz in his retreat into idealism
was the failure (from Stieglitz's point of view) of the <I>291</I>/Modern
Gallery experiment. Through a return to the penultimate issue of <I>Camera
Work</I> I now would like to show that what was at stake in Stieglitz's
brief partnership with the <I>291</I> review and the Modern Gallery
was nothing less than Stieglitz's auracular aesthetic and institutional
philosophy. For just as the institutional philosophy of the 291 gallery
was in many ways of a piece with the aesthetic beliefs propounded there,
so too was the commercial institutional philosophy of the Modern Gallery
associated with an aesthetic. Stieglitz realized this fact, as evidenced
by his editorial decision to follow the article discussed above, "'291'
and the Modern Gallery," with a reprint of a de Zayas article, from the
July-August 1915 issue (no. 5-6) of <I>291</I>.

<P>
"New York n'a pas vu d'abord/ New York did not see at first" concludes
the famous issue consisting of five mechanomorphic drawings created by
Francis Picabia in New York in 1915. When viewed in the context of its
entire run, this issue of <I>291</I> stands out as the review's most
focused and programatic number. De Zayas' article denounces Stieglitz's
291 philosophy as inadequate to the current relationship between modern
art and its New York public, and proclaims a new aesthetic-institutional
framework to replace it. Subsequent issues of <I>291</I> were primarily
taken up with explaining or extrapolating from the ideas expressed in
this issue.

Picabia's five drawings are mechanomorphic portraits of, in order,
Stieglitz, Picabia himself, Agnes Ernst Meyer, de Zayas, and Paul
Haviland. Taken as a group, 
<b></b>
these portraits or caricatures demystify
their subjects on at least two levels. Beginning with the first of the
portraits (<A HREF="4.3lewis_1.html">
 1</A>), "Ici, c'est ici Stieglitz/ Foi et Amour" depicts
a broken camera whose bellows droops away from the subject before its
lens, the word "IDEAL" printed in German Gothic script. The fatigued
or impotent lens is accompanied by an automobile gear-shift and brake
handle in the background that are somehow attached to the camera. The
collage-like combination of these two components communicates a general
sense of sexualized mechanical breakdown--not only is the camera useless
for picture-taking, but the 
<b></b>
gear-shift (whatever its relation to
the camera) is in the neutral position, and the brake is set in the
parked or stopped position.

The mechanomorphic drawing associated with de Zayas is a similarly strange
mechanism (<A HREF="4.3lewis_2.html">
 2</A>), though it communicates a mechanized sexual vigor that
the limp lens does not. This is a key difference, as we shall see. The
drawing is difficult to interpret because the particular personal episodes
in de Zayas' life to which the drawing may refer remain a mystery. At
least three scholars have put forward interpretations of this drawing,
but none identifies all the drawing's components or provides a fully
convincing account of how the machine works. Dickran Tashjian sees at
the upper left a coin-operated sighting device, common on the sea-shore,
directing the gaze to a suspended female corset (<I>SP,</I> 39). Camfield
convincingly shows that this drawing (as well as others) is derived
mostly from advertisements using schematic diagrams of electrical systems
(<I>FP</I>, . 105, 110) which Picabia adapted so as to connect the
corset (moving clockwise from the upper left) "by a line from the region
of the heart to what appears to be a gigantic spark plug, a hand crank,
and two automobile headlights (lower left and right) with a female plug
between them that eventually connects (as does the hand crank) at the
point of sex on the corset" (<I>FP,</I> 84).

<P>
I want to supplement these helpful accounts by considering how the
text of this piece may help to clarify the relationship between the
sighting device and the corset contraption. In the upper right corner
are the words "J'AI VU et c'est de toi qu'il s'agit" ["I SAW and this
[i.e. this 'portrait'] is about you"]; at the lower left are the words
"DE ZAYAS! DE ZAYAS! JE SUIS VENU SUR LES RIVAGES DU PONT-EUXIN," above
which is depicted the sun setting over water. The latter bit of text
is based on Ovid's poem of exile, the <I>Tristia</I> (it most closely
resembles V.ii., lines 63-64). But the alteration of the text seems
important: whereas Ovid always accompanies his evocations of the Euxine
(the savage shores of the Black Sea, site of his unhappy exile) with
adjectives such as "sinister," "formless," or "ill-omened," Picabia
leaves out any such description. Picabia's 1915 return to New York is
red, then, as an exile on a strange shore, but free of complaint or
lamentation. Indeed, if it is Picabia who, shipboard, is looking through
the sighting device (as the "J'ai vu" seems to suggest) and crying out
"De Zayas, De Zayas!" as he approaches shore, the sight he sees is a
mechanized peep show, a vision of a girating "fille n&eacute;e sans
m&egrave;re" set into motion by de Zayas' efforts on behalf of modern
art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 It might be that this sight gives a jolt to Picabia's
imagination by way of the spark plug, illuminating in him (hence the
headlights) the insight, key at this time in his career, that the world
of art is a desire-fueled machine of the same order as the American car
industry Picabia so admired.

Though many details remain mysterious, it is clear that the mechanomorphic
structure depicted here, like the one caricaturing Stieglitz, offers a
humorous commentary on its subject, in which sex, machines, and art play
a role. The de Zayas portrait presents a machine that, though hardly
sleek or refined, functions vigorously (at least on paper), contrasting
with the malfunctioning Stieglitz portrait. Taken in conjunction with
the portrait that precedes "De Zayas! De Zayas!," the drawing of the

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 78]</b>
spark-plug (<A HREF="4.3lewis_3.html">
 3</A>) entitled "Portrait d'une jeune fille
am&eacute;ricaine dans l'&eacute;tat de nudit&eacute;" ["Portrait of
an American girl in the state of nudity"], the viewer is confirmed
in the overall impression that artistic creativity is a function of
mechanized sexual desire, red in these works by jolting, grinding,
and jerking chains of cause and effect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 This mechanized
and sexualized creativity is not transcendent in its passion; it never
attains satisfaction or release. The word "For-ever" on the spark-plug,
for instance, parodies loving devotion, the source 
<b></b>
of comfort
and consistency in any relationship. "For-ever" here becomes a slogan
advertising the consistent efficacy of a nude American girl for firing
up the strange engine of sexual desire, a constant jolt driving the
artist to express himself; he does so in terms of brakes and gear-shifts
which engage to produce constant erotic agitation, without guarantee of
eventual release or relaxation.

The remaining drawings continue the theme: the inscription under the
lamp portraying Paul Haviland (<A HREF="4.3lewis_4.html">
 4</A>), "La po&eacute;sie est comme lui"
["Poetry is like him"], professes the idealist aesthete's quasi-religious
conception of poetry as the secular light of the world, a sentiment
parodically overshadowed by the fact that the soldier-shaped lamp in
the drawing is not only unplugged but unpluggable--it is literally
missing its plug. Finally, Picabia's self-portrait (<A HREF="4.3lewis_5.html">
 5</A>) employing a
car horn positioned against what appears to be the cross-section of an
automobile cylinder and spark plug suggests that the only efficiently
working machine depicted in this series is one that calls attention
to itself, "blowing its own horn," as Maria Llu&iuml;sa Borr&agrave;s
has 
<b></b>
remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The inscription Picabia includes, "Le
Saint des Saints/ C'est de moi qu'il s'agit dans ce portrait," suggests
through its ironic conflation of the divine ("The Holy of Holies") with
the artist and the machine that the traditional hierarchy of creators
creating in their respective images may in modern society ultimately
reduce to a schematic blueprint for a machine that operates without
regard for distinctions between divine, spiritual, and industrial
registers of creation.

<P>
These captioned images, then, taken as a whole, can be read as an effort
to demystify Stieglitz's ideal of art as the emanation of genius complete
unto itself; they replace the transcendental satisfaction of creative
desire with blueprints expressing creativity as a mechanized eroticism
without an off button. This contrasts with Stieglitz's photographs
of nudes, as well as those he chose to print in <I>Camera Work</I> by
other photographers, all of which are steeped in a symbolist aesthetic
of the transcendance of erotic desire through artistic beauty. At
another aesthetic or formal level, Picabia's drawings challenge even
further the notion of the artist as creative genius because they are
composed almost entirely of what we now call found objects. The camera,
circuitry schematics, spark-plug, lamp, and car horn are all copied from
trade catalogues or advertisements, while the captions are in many cases
taken from 
<b></b>
the pink pages of the <I>Petit Larousse</I>, the section
of that dictionary where famous phrases from other languages (primariy
Latin and Greek) are translated into French.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Creativity has
of course not been expunged from these pieces simply through the use of
found objects and phrases. But the nature of this particular creativity
is quite different from that held in high esteem by Stieglitz. There
is a clever, parasitic quality to this aesthetic that runs against the
grain of the 291 aesthetic.

<P>
To be sure, Stieglitz enjoyed poking fun at art critics, the public,
and even himself, but usually in a way that made him out to be the
master casting pearls before swine. Stieglitz's idea of satire was to
highlight the public's overwhelming stupidity and need for guidance in
matters of art: the artist or avant-garde impresario was never satirized,
only the public. An example of what he felt was a satirical "experiment"
involved his refusal to promote the sale of the last issue of <I>291</I>,
in which his famous photograph "The Steerage" was reproduced. His
idea was that by not advertising, one would be able to gauge what the
"American people would do when left to themselves." The "satire" came
after the issue's unsurprisingly dismal sales, when he decided to have
a rag picker come to take away the eight thousand unsold copies of the
photograph, including the deluxe prints: he would go ironically along
with the public in its stupidity, throwing away two dollar copies of
a print that "an official of a Berlin museum had been willing to pay a
hundred dollars for" (<I>ASAS,</I> 127).

<P>
Picabia's parodic creativity is different because, rather than resisting
machine-age commodity culture through an exalted act of supersession, he
parodically employs its very images and logic--in these drawings, man
has been replaced by his own creation, the machine, which achieves and
fails in precisely the same way he does, only more transparently, because
stripped of any veil of idealism. In this way art functions in parallel
with the industrial economy. The conjunction of image and inscription
lays symbolically bare the erotic essence of machine age modernity as
Picabia envisions it. Picabia says as much in an October, 1915 interview
with <I>The New York Tribune</I>: the machine and the commodity culture
it symbolizes are "more than a mere adjunct of life. [The machine] is
really a part of human life--perhaps its very soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 As
such, machines necessarily dictate the direction of his very artistic
project. He goes on to say that he "doesn't know what possibilities may
be in store" for this project; this is because, as a kind of machine
himself, he cannot place himself at an ideal point outside the mechanism
and view his trajectory.

<P>
Picabia's embrace of the objects and commodity logic of the machine-age,
as represented in his mechanomorphic aesthetic, entails an institutional
corollary, one that admits the buying and selling of art objects as
a legitimate enterprise. The art object that is created out of the
industrial world of commodified machines, indeed as one of those
commodities, renders meaningless the definition of artistic purity
as the operation of the creative genius in a space untouched by
considerations of popularity or financial success. Picabia views his
two-dimensional machines as part and parcel of the larger universe of
three-dimensional machines, a universe encompassing humans and all
the objects they make.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 I don't believe that Picabia's
intention in these drawings was merely to create something saleable. My
point is that the truth 
<b></b>
value of this work exists on a different
plane from that sanctioned by Stieglitz. Instead of being positively
articulated in the recognition of the sanctified originality of the
canvas, Picabia's artistic truth reveals itself in the comic, negative
recognition afforded by the mechanomorphic image. This image negates the
idealistic viewer's belief in a higher realm of art with a schematic
diagram of the mechanized workings of human erotic desire, including
the mechanism of artistic creation itself. What de Zayas characterized
in the Modern Gallery's prospectus as Stieglitz's "negative solution" to
the problem of commercialism--its elimination--has been replaced with a
new solution, the destruction of idealism built into the work in a way
that, paradoxically, renders the issue of commercialism of secondary
importance. Whether the artist is compensated or not for his effort in
creating this negative recognition is beside the point, because the power
of the negative recognition will not be changed by the buying or selling
of the piece. The piece is thus fertile in its erotic infertility,
its refusal of transcendence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The negative recognition
is built into the parodic logic of the representation, which itself
is simply a machine among machines, rather than an "art object" <I>per
se</I>. The effect of the negative recognition is not dependent upon an
aura surrounding the work that must be protected from unworthy buyers who
may not respect it. Thus, the effect on the viewer of Picabia's machine
art can thrive in a different institutional framework than Stieglitz's
idealistic enclave.

<P>
The de Zayas-Haviland-Meyer group heralded Picabia's machine art as
the product of a new aesthetic-institutional practice that could renew
the vitality of 291. It is difficult to determine the nuances of the
group's understanding of this new aesthetic because it did not publish
close analyses of the mechanomorphic drawings. But there is no doubt
that its members understood the institutional consequences and economic
ramifications of the mechanomorphic aesthetic--de Zayas' use of sexual
metaphors to describe Picabia's effect on American culture attests
to that.

<P>
Why was open commercialism a consequence of this aesthetic? The <I>291</I>
group understood Picabia's mechanomorphic art broadly as a celebration
of the machine, which they took to be an emanation of the objectively
modern essence of America. Paul Haviland writes an editorial to this
effect in the very next issue of <I>291</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 De Zayas,
in the <I>291</I> article which follows Picabia's five drawings, uses
this link between the machine, objectivity, and American modernity to
comment upon and, ultimately, criticize Stieglitz's work at the 291
gallery. He begins by writing that American intellectuals have prevented
New York from assimilating the true spirit of modern art; that they have
"covered" that spirit--the metaphor is that of contraception--with false
"ideal[s]" borrowed from Europe. American culture is at its core modern
("all American activities are entirely in accord with the spirit of modern
art . . . America has the same complex mentality as the true modern
artist [:] the same continual need of expressing itself in the present
and for the present"), but most Americans are not aware of this fact,
and as a consequence little truly significant modern American art has
been created. Most American intellectuals and critics, says de Zayas,
are incapable of leading America to the knowledge of its essential
modernity 
<b></b>
because they are non-creative popularizers who merely
copy and reiterate the past theories and positions of European movements
without producing anything vital. They lack a sense of, or a commitment
to, contemporaneity. Their tendency to follow rather than innovate means
that, in the current (post-Armory Show) commercial climate, they are
really only concerned with lining their own pockets: "The critics do not
work to develop their knowledge, or to spread knowledge. . . . The press
has established a false notion of American life. It has succeeded in
creating in the American people a fictitious need for a false art and a
false literature. The press has in view but one thing:--profit." In this
environment, the goal of the Modern Gallery is to appeal directly to the
American public's inherent taste for contemporaneity, thus circumventing
the critics' attempts to purvey stale art and ideas.

<P>
The <I>291</I> group was intensely interested in assessing the
consequences, both artistic and commercial, of the new popularity of
modern art in post-1913 New York. The brief article entitled "Economic
Laws and Art" from the satire/notes page of the second issue of <I>291</I>
(April 1915) attests to this interest and demonstrates an openness to
the possibility that popularity and up-to-the-minute modernity could go
hand in hand, a possibility Stieglitz would never entertain. Here they
note the increasing economic success of modern art galleries in New York
in 1915, and ask whether this popularity is ultimately good or bad for
art. Their stance is not automatically anti-commercial; rather, they
look at commercialism as a tool that is in and of itself value-neutral:

The mere fact that [the Montross show of American Moderns] can take place
on Fifth Avenue where rents must be paid, is an important indication of
the change of the public attitude and the added fact that the gallery
was usually crowded at five cents per head, shows that the interest is
not spotty but widespread. In short, it is safe to announce that cubism
or futurism, or whatever else these men call their work, is not only
beginning to pay its way, but is undergoing the trying ordeal of being
the fashion. The obvious question is: 'Who took the lead, the artists or
the public?' In other words, is American cubism, or futurism, so sincere
an expression that the speedy conversion of the public to its serious
consideration was inevitable, or did the public interest, aroused by
291 and the big Armory Exhibition of French moderns, create a demand
which our men are trying consciously or unconsciously to supply? Judging
from results in the Montross exhibition, both kinds of influence are
present, thus leaving to the buying public an interesting opportunity
of furthering modern thought by weeding out the true from the false . . .

The question that animated and worried Stieglitz--namely, are
artists being true to their own creativity, or merely trying to fill
a speculated need in a burgeoning market?--remains a question that
intrigues Stieglitz's associates. Their methods for finding an answer,
however, differ from his in important ways: Stieglitz saw himself as
sole arbiter of the question, while the <I>291</I> writers emphasize the
essential role of the public in any answer, guardedly putting faith in
the public's ability, in the words of the article, to "further modern
thought by weeding out the true from the false." The 
<b></b>
 <I>291</I>
editors found evidence in the urban life around them that the American
"buying public" was animated, at least in part, by the same spirit
of modernity driving modern art--with the sole caveat being that the
public, not fully aware of its true modernity, may need to learn to
discern between the true and the merely fashionable before it can see
itself in the art it faces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 De Zayas makes explicit his
belief that Stieglitz and his work at 291 failed to render the New York
public adequately aware of its true up-to-the-minute modernist identity:
"The real American life is still unexpressed," writes de Zayas.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

America remains to be discovered. Stieglitz wanted to work this
miracle. He wanted to discover America. Also, he wanted the Americans to
discover themselves. But, in pursuing his object, he employed the shield
["capote" in the French version of the article, slang for condom] of
psychology and metaphysics. He has failed.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For de Zayas, the problem with Stieglitz is that he treated the spirit
of modern art (the essence of American culture) like a mystical entity
removed from immediate life rather than an expression of contemporary
culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Stieglitz surrounded and immobilized this spirit
with what de Zayas calls "prejudices," his word for the aura which,
by perpetuating a certain elitism associated with style, has prevented
Americans from keeping up with their own modernity as it is reflected
back to them in truly evolving modern art. Americans falsely took these
static prejudices for modernity; consequently, when, thanks to the efforts
of the lawyer and collector John Quinn, the tariff on art imports fell
after the Armory Show and the art market expanded, a false notion of art
became popularized and institutionalized by both profit-seeking critics
and laggard artists (whom de Zayas labels "copyists"). This taste for
false art acted as a brake on the evolution of modern art, diverting
attention from objective contemporary instances of modern life into dead
styles or "methods" of the recent past:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Art is a white lie that is only living when it is born of truth. And
there is no other truth than objective truth. The others are but
prejudices. Stieglitz tried to discover America with prejudices. He first,
and he alone, has placed before New York the various foundation supports
of the evolution of modern art. He wished to work through suggestion. But
soon, commercialism brought an avalanche of paintings. Those lepers,
those scullery maids of art, those Sudras of progress--the copyists, got
busy. They even believed themselves to be part of the evolution because,
instead of copying trees, they copied a method. America remains to be
discovered. And to do it there is but one way:--DISCOVER IT!
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
De Zayas believes that the institutional framework for modern art
that Stieglitz devised was weak because it relied upon subjective
expression--"suggestion"--rather than a direct, objective presentation
of modernity as it is, in motion. For de Zayas, photography is the
art-form <I>par excellence</I> for the revelation of the outer world's
objective nature. In de Zayas' eyes, then, Stieglitz began his work
as a modernist appropriately: as a proponent of straight (or what de
Zayas calls "static") photography, 
<b></b>
Stieglitz stood for modernist
objectivity. In claiming artistic superiority for straight photography
over photography involving the manipulation of negatives, Stieglitz
demonstrated a truly modern consciousness of the machine's objectifying
power over and against aestheticizing "prejudice" or nostalgia: continuing
the sexual metaphor, de Zayas writes, "[Stieglitz] worked in the American
spirit. He married Man to Machinery and obtained issue."

<P>
Stieglitz failed, however, when he attempted to modernize American
plastic expression. His failure lay in the way he presented modern art
to the public. He asked the American public to look at modern work as
Art, a rarefied distillation of genius emanating from and appealing
to a certain initiated segment of society, rather than the sign of the
public's own unacknowledged, constantly evolving vital energy:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
When he wanted to ["obtain issue"] with art, he imported works capable
of serving as examples of modern thought plastically expressed. His
intention was to have them used as supports for finding an expression of
the conception of American life. He found against him open opposition and
servile imitation. He did not succeed in bringing out the individualistic
expression of the spirit of the community. He has put the American
art public to the test. He has fought to change <I>good taste</I> into
<I>common sense</I>. But he has not succeeded in putting in motion the
enormous mass of the inertia of this public's self-sufficiency. America
has not the slightest conception of the value of the work accomplished by
Stieglitz. Success, and success on a large scale, is the only thing that
can make an impression on American mentality. Any effort, any tendency,
which does not possess the radiation of advertising remains practically
ignored. America waits, inertly, for its own potentiality to be expressed
in art.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Many critics, particularly those who want to see de Zayas and <I>291</I>
as proto-dada and, thus, critical of capitalism in a way that fits with
B&uuml;rger's or Huyssen's characterizations of the avant-garde, take this
passage as an indictment of "the radiation of advertising" and American
commercialism in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Yet, when read in context, we can
see that this phrase expresses de Zayas' sincere belief that commercialism
has been and could continue to be an important defining trait of the
essentially modernist American identity. Americans as a people of mixed
origins and beliefs will never express themselves in art unconsciously,
says de Zayas, because they are not a unified people with a culturally
inbred second nature--a cultural "common sense" naturally imbued with
"good taste"--that flows from a national tradition. The heterogeneity
of American culture, says de Zayas, shows through "in politics, in
industry, in science, in commerce, in finance, in the popular theatre,
in architecture, in sport, in dress," realms of life in which Americans
have been unafraid to "get rid of European prejudices and [create their]
own laws in accordance with [their] own customs." But things have been
different in the realm of art, says de Zayas. In art, Americans feel the
need for an "exotic education"; in learning to copy European methods they
develop "an inner censorship" which blocks a direct perception of the
heterogeneous truth of the American "milieu." Result: "They do not see
their surroundings at first hand." De Zayas describes those surroundings
in striking terms:
<b></b>


<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One lives here [in the United States] in a continuous change which makes
impossible the perpetuation and the universality of an idea. History in
the United States is impossible and meaningless. One lives here in the
present. In a continuous struggle to adapt oneself to the milieu. . . . In
the United States there is no general sentiment in any sphere of thought.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
According to de Zayas, Picabia recognizes that Americans are really
modernists, that "America has the same complex mentality as the true
modern artist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 In keeping with this realization, Picabia
has created art in America that does not imitate existing false notions
of artistic propriety. He has achieved this, says de Zayas, by seizing
upon everyday objects (machines, schematic renderings of mechanisms,
images in advertisements and catalogues) and undercutting the viewer's
attempts to remove them to a higher realm separate from the milieu in
which they were found--that is, he refuses them the status of "art," in
de Zayas' sense of that word. Implied in the sustained use of sexual and
reproductive metaphor is de Zayas's conviction that Picabia accomplishes
this undercutting through the blasphemous juxtaposition of a found machine
image with a found bit of relatively exalted text (for example, the
sacred phrase "Le saint des saints" in the self-caricature, or the epic
lyricism of "Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont-Euxin" in the de Zayas
portrait), a transgressive act which works together with the eroticizing
of these objects to suggest that American modernity is grounded in a new,
non-transcendable sexuality objectified by machines. De Zayas refers
to this kind of eroticized, blasphemous rejection of the tradition of
idealistic art at the end of his article when he holds up Picabia as
the hope for a truly vital (and virile) American modern art. He writes,
"Of all those who have come to conquer America, Picabia is the only one
who has done as did Cortez. He has burned his ship behind him. He does
not protect himself with any shield ["capote"]. He has married America
like a man who is not afraid of consequences. He has obtained results."

<P>
Stieglitz's decision to reprint in <I>Camera Work,</I> one after the
other, the withheld circular stating the goals of the Modern Gallery,
this essay from <I>291</I>, and an "Epitaph for Alfred Stieglitz" by
Marsden Hartley attests to his understanding that the Modern Gallery
and Picabia's mechanomorphic style were complementary parts in a plan to
replace him with a new institution. The talk of his failure and the use of
the past tense to describe his achievements must have been particularly
hard to take in 1915, especially in an organ like <I>291</I>, which
he was supporting with his own money, space, labor, and reputation. De
Zayas, despite the emasculating rhetoric in his article, sought not so
much to replace Stieglitz as to bring him and his achievements at 291
(especially his pathbreaking insights into the relationship between
photography and modern art) to greater effect by showing Stieglitz the
ways in which modern art and everyday American culture were intimately
linked in their common contemporaneity.

<P>
What ultimately became of de Zayas' project? Ironically, the Modern
Gallery was a great success with the public, but a financial failure. De
Zayas was not a very good salesman, and this fact, coupled with his habit
of not keeping records, eventually made his European suppliers wary of
lending him their works on consignment 
<b></b>
(<I>MDZ,</I> 50).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

The Arensbergs bought the majority of their collection there and at the
De Zayas Gallery, which succeeded The Modern Gallery from 1919-1921
and which they backed financially (<I>AS,</I> 196).

<P>
The tie to the Arensbergs suggests that de Zayas' interest in the
mechanomorphic aesthetic continued, since the Arensbergs' apartment was
the gathering place until 1920 for artists inspired by machines and found
objects, including Man Ray and Duchamp, as well as Picabia. Evidence also
suggests that de Zayas's view of the compatibility between commerce and
the mechanomorphic aesthetic lived on in the Arensberg circle. When in
1921 Man Ray describes to Tristan Tzara the end of New York dada, he is
not at all unfriendly to the commercial and promotional philosophy of
the earlier Modern Gallery:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Cher Tzara, dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will
not tolerate a rival,--will not notice dada. It is true that no efforts
to make it public have been made, beyond the placing of your and our
dadas in the bookshops, but there is no one here to work for it, and
no money to be taken in for it, or donated to it. So dada in New York
must remain a secret. . . . The appearance of New York dada was made
possible through the generosity of a few poor friends, but it cannot go
on so. Perhaps in the future we may do something again.

<P>
The belief that avant-garde art expresses the unconscious essence of
modern New York remains ("all New York is dada"), but the energy and
finances needed to make people aware of this fact are lacking.

<P>
Despite the fact that it was not as successful in practice as it promised
to be, the genesis of The Modern Gallery out of 291 and the differences
it brought to light between Stieglitz and the Haviland-Meyer-de
Zayas-Picabia group signify a larger shift in the aesthetic as well as the
institutional framework of modern art in New York in the years following
the Armory Show. For instance, Robert J. Coady's gallery and his magazine
<I>The Soil</I> (1916-1917) portrayed popular American culture,
especially sports, comedy, and heavy machinery such as steam hammers and
locomotive engines, as proper ground for modern art in America, while
Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades challenged the aesthetic and institutional
bounds of art along lines similar to those of Picabia; Duchamp in turn
influenced the artists who came into contact with him at the Arensbergs'
apartment. And in both cases, we find proponents of modern art positioning
themselves, like de Zayas, in a guardedly optimistic manner with regard
to the commodification of the art object. This tempered acceptance
of commodification as a fact of modernity, which, as we have seen,
grew out of a benign view of American commodity culture as the organic
expression of technologized modernity, needs to be taken into account in
characterizations of the historical avant-garde's engagement with society.

The desire to be contemporary held by avant-gardists such as Picabia
and de Zayas has significance for our understanding of the historical
avant-garde. Recognizing its importance is crucial to assessing the
enthusiasm for America manifested by res such as Marcel Duchamp,
Picabia, and others whom scholars such 
<b></b>
as Huyssen and B&uuml;rger
include as members of the historical avant-garde. For them, America seemed
to epitomize modernity: it was truly the <I>new</I> world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

Exploitation of this essential modernity, rather than opposition to
high bourgeois culture and its art institutions, struck them as being
of utmost importance. Artists like Picabia, Duchamp and de Zayas, or,
for that matter, Man Ray, Joseph Stella, Charles Demuth, or Charles
Sheeler, did not believe that American society required fundamental
transformation before it could embrace modern art. Instead, art
needed to evolve in the direction of contemporary consumer society if
it was itself to be truly expressive of modernity. In their opinion,
Americans were at worst merely unconscious of their society's inherent
avant-garde tendencies and therefore in need of little more than a
dose of self-consciousness. Accordingly, the post-Armory Show New York
avant-garde optimistically placed the modern fact of art commodification
at the center of its artistic production; it was a process that promised
both European and American artists an opportunity to establish continuity
between modernist art and modern life.

<P>
Because theorists have not acknowledged the importance of this
notion, they tend to misread the meaning of a key theme in art of
the period--machine imagery and technology. Huyssen, for instance,
perceptively notes the "crucial" role of technology and the "technological
imagination" in historical avant-garde art. But he interprets the
importance of that role solely in terms of its oppositional value:
technology was used by the historical avant-garde in a revolutionary
manner to transform life through art. The opposite, however, seems true
in the example at hand: the New York avant-garde's identification of
technology with the essence of mainstream American society and culture
resulted in the conviction that <I>art</I> could be transformed and
rendered truly modern by <I>life</I>--at least here. The Anglo-Saxon world
was the origin of technological innovation and the seat of a society
thoroughly modernized by technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Major res of the
historical avant-garde--several of whom would later be involved with
continental dada--created work in New York <I>not</I> with the intent
of abolishing the institutional category of 'art' by using avant-garde
creations to transform an anti-modernist society; rather, they attempted
to dissolve the barrier between art and life by creating art objects
that would be the contemporary, organic expression of a pre-existing
modernist society and culture.

<P>
Over-emphasis on the oppositional character of the avant-garde has
created an artificial chasm separating avant-garde res from their
contemporaries. Terms such as "high modernism," then, can become a
dumping ground for any writer or artist who is not easily accounted for
strictly in terms of opposition. Examples of avant-gardism in America
in the early twentieth century, such as those of Stieglitz and the
artists surrounding him, demonstrate how the idea of America as the
epitome of a culture thoroughly imbued with technological modernity
could lead artists to accept the fact of art's commodification
and create out of that acceptance, doing so in the belief that it
would allow them fuller participation in the contemporaneous whole of
modernity. These avant-gardists necessarily regarded the establishment
of a just commercial relationship between artist and public--what
de Zayas termed 
<b></b>
"mutual service"--as social ratification of
that fuller participation, because they recognized that monetary worth
makes up such an important part of the way modern society expresses its
values. Insofar as concerns of this sort continue to be essential in
our contemporary debates about art, such clear-headedness about modern
values may be worthy of admiration. It can remind us that desires other
than oppositionality often motivated the activities of the historical
avant-garde and testify to the ongoing importance, for art and for
artists, of a sense of contemporaneity.

This shift may sound like the one from autonomous art to non-autonomous
art familiar to readers of B&uuml;rger. The difference here is that,
in this example, both institutions are undeniably avant-garde, and the
avant-garde institution devoted to the idea of autonomous art (bourgeois
and capitalist in B&uuml;rger's reading) was anti-commercial, while the
one replacing it was openly commercial.

In the world of literary modernism, The Sunwise Turn, a New York
modernist bookstore in operation from 1916-1927, represented within
one institution the tension between these two attitudes towards the fact
of a consumer economy for modernist work (see Lawrence Rainey, "Consuming
Investments: Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>," <I>James Joyce Quarterly</I> 33
[Summer 1996]: 551-55). The store had two owners: Harold Loeb, like
de Zayas, considered the "profit system" a fact of life and committed
himself to operating without a loss, while his Stieglitz-like partner,
Mary Mowbray Clarke, expressed a preference for cultural patronage from
the wealthy over the "evil" of "profit." The strain ultimately proved
too great: Rainey tells us Loeb sold his share of the shop in early 1921
(Rainey, 554). Significantly, Clarke and her first partner originally
planned to locate their store in the 291 building.

Stieglitz's most treasured American painters, John Marin and Arthur

painting very little; also, Stieglitz's wife's stream of income from her

Attesting to this sense of American commodity culture as modernist
standard are the frequent public comments by European avant-garde artists
present in New York from 1913-1923 to the effect that "America is
the country of the art of the future" (Duchamp, quoted in Naumann, <I>New

Naumann, <I>NYD,</I> 20, interprets the 1913 painting "Culture
physique" ["Physical Culture"], painted after Picabia's first trip to
New York, from Jan to April 1913, to show that Picabia probably thought
of art in terms of commodification well before his mechanomorphic phase.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT27" HREF="#REF27">27</A>.
Many of Picabia's mechanomorphic drawings of the period 1915-1919
are inspired by this notion of technology as ring a quintessentially
modern form of artistic reproduction that functions parodically in
a manner contrary to the laws of human reproduction: see "La fille
n&eacute;e sans m&egrave;re" ["The Girl Born without a Mother"],
"L'Enfant carburateur" ["Child Carburetor"], "Prostitution universelle"
["Universal Prostitution"] in <I>NYD</I>, 62-65, 69-72. Though
not eroticized with the same obsessive energy, the mechanomorphic work
of Duchamp and Jean Crotti, working with Picabia in New York at the
same time, and of Americans such as Charles Demuth, Morton Schamberg and
Man Ray, all frequenters of the Arensberg circle, exhibit similar erotic
conceptions of the machine as creative in a way that parodies normal human
sexuality and fertility: see Duchamp's "Fountain," cocoa grinders, and
"Large Glass," Crotti's 1916 "The Mechanical Forms of Love in Movement,"
Man Ray's 1919 "My First Born," and Schamberg's 1916 "Machine" (<I>FP,</I>
plates 146, 148, 149). Camfield evokes the literary erotic machines
of Raymond Roussel and Alfred Jarry (particularly as represented in
<I>Impressions d'Afrique,</I> 1912, and <I>Le Surm&acirc;le,</I> 1911,
respectively) as likely influences on Picabia (<I>FP,</I> 78-79).

A short note in the <I>New York American,</I> 1 November 1915,
considers the significance of modern art's popularity in connection with
The Modern Gallery itself, stating, "The question of how far the ideas of
a comparatively small number of artists are biting into the consciousness
of the community will be solved by the world's test of having arrived--the
saleable value of the product. This will be something, though it will
not settle the real value of the ideas" (quoted in <I>HWW,</I> 95).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT30" HREF="#REF30">30</A>.
Looking back on 1915, "the golden year for modern art," de Zayas
says that he strived to make the Modern Gallery a place where people
could "think for themselves." "I wanted to bring the artist in contact
with the public, the producer with the consumer without intermediaries"
(<I>HWW,</I> 71, 94). He contrasts this philosophy with that of Stieglitz,
who "dealt with the public individually, putting the visitor to a sort
of third degree to get at their [sic] mental reactions" (<I>HWW,</I> 126).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT31" HREF="#REF31">31</A>.
Tashjian (<I>SP,</I> 40) and Arturo Schwarz (<I>New York Dada:
Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia</I> [Munich: Prestel-Verlag and St&auml;dtische
Galerie im Lenbachhaus, 1973], 193) quote this phrase without noting that
it was written within the context of de Zayas' creation of the Modern
Gallery and his primary criticism of Stieglitz, namely, that Stieglitz
stifled healthy commercial opportunity. Both dismiss de Zayas as "merely
an art dealer" once he and Stieglitz have gone their separate ways.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT32" HREF="#REF32">32</A>.
Picabia himself says as much in his interview with the <I>New York
Tribune</I>: he attributes his new mechanomorphic style to his realization
upon coming to America and seeing New York that "the genius of the modern
world is in machinery"; Picabia, like Duchamp, believed America was
"destined to become the center of modern art" (<I>FP,</I> 76).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT33" HREF="#REF33">33</A>.
The Modern Gallery was the first uptown gallery devoted to modern
art, and lasted three years. According to de Zayas, Eugene Meyer was the
principal investor, with Haviland and Picabia also contributing. Meyer
insisted on a no returns policy, so buyers were limited to the experienced
collectors Arthur B. Davies, John Quinn, and Walter Arensberg (<I>HWW,</I>
94). Picabia and his wife Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia supplied much of the
art, both from their own collection and from Paris contacts (<I>FP,</I>
76). See <I>HWW,</I> 134-55, for a complete list of The Modern and
De Zayas Galleries' exhibits.

This view of America was especially widespread in the period preceding
surrealism (prior to 1924). Other European avant-garde res who viewed
America, particularly New York, as essentially avant-garde or modernist
include Blaise Cendrars (see, e.g., his 1912 poem "P&acirc;ques &agrave;
New York"), Arthur Cravan, John Heartfield, and Hannah H&ouml;ch.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT36" HREF="#REF36">36</A>.
Anglo-America's superior economic and technological development
in comparison to that of the Continent was a point of pride among
Anglo-American avant-gardists, and a rallying point around which they
sometimes centered their efforts to promote their work. See Wyndham
Lewis, in the opening manifesto of <I>BLAST 1</I> (1914 [reprint
Santa Rosa: Black Sparrow Press, 1989], 39), and Ezra Pound in the
essay "Patria Mia" (1913, reprinted in Ezra Pound, <I>Selected Prose
1909-1965</I>, ed. William Cookson [New York: New Directions, 1973],
99-141). Both argue that England and America are ideally suited to be
the world leaders in modern art because everyday life in those countries
is already thoroughly structured by modern realities, particularly the
manufacture of machinery (for Lewis) and entrepreneurialism and the
industry-driven construction of steel-beamed buildings (for Pound).
