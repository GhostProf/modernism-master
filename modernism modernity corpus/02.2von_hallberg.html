<p>
Imagism occupies a special place in the history of
Anglo-American poetry. In classrooms it is commonly taken to
represent the impulses of modernism in poetry. The
modestness of the poems by Pound, H.D., Williams, and others
in Pound's <I>Des Imagistes </I> and later anthologies
is acknowledged at the same time that the impact of Imagist
tenets on subsequent poetry is shown to have been decisive
and far-reaching. This approach to Imagism presents the
effects of modernism as technical: the elimination of
indefinite descriptive language, the fragmentation of
syntax, the breakdown of meter, and the banishment of
discursive language. Since we have known for some time,
however, that literary movements even more than individual
literary creations are never merely technical, never void of
ideology, one obvious interpretive task has been to infer
the implicit political significance of poems such as H.D.'s
"Heat," Pound's "In a Station of the Metro," or his prose
accounts of Imagist doctrine. This critical procedure,
though, has several unattractive consequences. First, the
process of inference is often guided by essentialist
conceptions of political positions--a "fascism," most
importantly, that one understands retrospectively as
implicit in poems of 1913. Second, when some recognizable
political position can be inferred by a process of
extrapolation, one may not work hard enough to reconstruct
the less recognizable aspects of the ideological context of
the text, in this case of London in 1913-14. In the case of
Imagism, the political positions that did not survive the
years just before World War I are obscured by those that,
after World War II, have become crucial to literary
historians. 

<B></B>

 Third, this procedure
presents Anglo-American
modernists as having suppressed their political motivation
under a cover of formal proposals, whereas the truth is more
that formal procedures were understood by poets and readers
as implicitly but importantly expressive of political ideas.

<p>
The most trenchant statement of the political significance
of the Imagist method was Donald Davie's in 1952:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
By hunting his own sort of "definiteness" (truth only in the
particular) he [Pound] is led to put his trust not in human
institutions but in individuals. Similarly he pins his faith
on individual words, grunts, broken phrases, half-uttered
exclamations (as we find them in the <I>Cantos</I>), on
speech atomized, all syllogistic and syntactical forms
broken down. Hence his own esteem of the definite lands him
at last in yawning vagueness, the "intuitive" welcome to
Mussolini (he "plays his hunch"). . . .
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be too much to say that this is the
logical end of abandoning prose syntax. But at least the development from
imagism in poetry to fascism in politics is clear and
unbroken.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
There is much about these remarks that is revealing still,
and some of it (pertaining to individuals and institutions)
is very close to the historical context I want to
reconstruct. But what is obscured by this view of the
techniques of Imagist poetry is the fact that this poetry
was written and initially interpreted in an intellectual
context that included not protofascism but some other--not
altogether unattractive--derivatives of anarchist and
syndicalist, thought, to which Pound and others directed
Imagist poems and the publicity on their behalf. My point is
not that there are no connections between Imagism and
Pound's later fascism, or among anarchism, syndicalism and
fascism, but rather that one can tune one's understanding of
Pound's pre-war political affiliations and those of his
collaborators more finely than is usually done, and that the
politics of modernism was more complicated than is usually
acknowledged. Davie's claim was always that the taste for
Imagist techniques in poetry after World War II was
unwittingly complicitous with the impulses that promoted
Italian fascism in the 1920s and 1930s. My own sense is that
the techniques of Imagism carry no necessary political
valence beyond that attributed to them by readers and
writers in a particular place and time. But whether
techniques are essentially neutral, as I believe, or not,
the question I wish to raise is whether Imagism was not
libertarian or antisocialist rather than protofascist in its
political significance.

<p>
The particular context I will invoke is that of the journals
<I>The New Freewoman </I> and its successor <I>The
Egoist </I>(1914-19). Pound wrote seventy-five items in
these journals during these years when he was also closely
associated with <I>Poetry, The New Age, </I>and <I>The
Little Review. </I>He was apparently comfortable in 1913
writing and soliciting manuscripts for <I>The New Freewoman,
</I>whose first pages were regularly filled by Dora
Marsden's dissenting feminist editorials. He was entirely
capable of complaining about women editors whom he did not
altogether admire; his remarks about Harriet Monroe make
that clear. But about Marsden he was not ungenerous; though
he was cautious, he was not even particularly critical of
her until 

<B></B>

 1917.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In 1913,
as he was first
collaborating in the journal, he wrote that, although he
needed some editorial latitude, he did not want the literary
pages that he might edit to "queer the editorial
columns."
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
He respected Marsden's role in the
writing (not just the running) of <I>The New Freewoman
</I>and <I>The Egoist. </I>He warned Amy Lowell that to
purchase the journal and move it to Boston might be
expensive, "unless Miss Marsden can keep her corner or some
corner to let loose in. She has her own clientele who look
for her."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
He was slightly cagey, it is true,
about his connections to the journal, though rather less so
when speaking directly to Marsden. "The seven minutes at my
instant disposal is hardly enough to define my philosophical
credentials adequately," he wrote to Marsden, the
philosophizing editor of <I>The New Freewoman, </I>in July
1913. "I suppose I'm an individualist. . . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
On the other hand, he did not claim to approve of all that
appeared in the journal's pages: "I'm responsible for what I
get into the paper but I am at present nearly, oh we might
as well say quite, powerless to keep anything
out."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
What might the term "individualist" have meant in mid-1913?
And how serious was Pound about this affiliation? First, it
was the rubric under which <I>The New Freewoman </I>(after
1913) and <I>The Egoist </I>would appear: <I>The Egoist: An
Individualist Review. </I>Pound was deliberately, however
diffidently, asserting ideological conformity to the general
position of the journal, and that position, as Michael
Levenson has shown, derived from the writings of Max
Stirner, Karl Marx's one-time friend and his adversary in
<I>The German Ideology. </I>

<p>
Stirner was the author of the anti-liberal polemic <I>Das
Einzige und sein Eigentum (The Ego and Its Own) </I>,
the first English translation of which appeared in London
and New York in 1907 with an introduction by the anarchist
Benjamin R. Tucker, who was also the American publisher; six
subsequent editions came out in London (1912, 1913, 1915,
1921) and New York (1913, 1918) during the next fourteen
years. (In 1918 Boni and Liveright--the publisher of Pound
after 1920, and of <I>The Waste Land </I>in 1922--included
Stirner's book in its Modern Library series.) <I>Das Einzige
</I>was translated into French , Spanish , and
Italian  as well; a Hebrew translation appeared in New
York in 1916. Stirner's book certainly hit a nerve--and
nowhere more than in England.

<p>
Before its publication, the key-term of his book,
"individualism," had circulated widely among libertarians
and anarchists. Benjamin Tucker's journal <I>Liberty </I>had
kept the significance of the term in debate during the
1890s. Between 1906 and 1910 six books with the words
"individual," "individualism," or "individualists" appeared
in London; whereas in the preceding five years there had
been only one. In 1911 four more such books were published,
and then six more between 1912 and 1915. The prerogatives of
the individual were a subject of controversy, which is to
say explicit uncertainty, in the 1890s and even more so in
England after 1906. Michael Levenson's recent book,
<I>Modernism and the Fate of the Individual, </I>shows that
British novelists from Conrad to Woolf were subjecting to
corrosive scrutiny the idea that there is some indissoluble
integrity to the individual psyche.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Against
the writing of Ford in <I>The Good Soldier </I> and
Lewis in <I>Tarr </I>, Stirner, Marsden, 

<B></B>

 and Pound
were trying to retain boundaries around the options of the
individual that belonged more to the nineteenth than to the
twentieth century.

<p>
Stirner made nominalism carry the force of antiliberalism,
as it later, for Marsden, carried that of antisocialism. The
liberal, Stirner argued, "takes little heed of what you
are<I> privatim--</I>nay, in a strict following out of his
principle sets no value at all on it--he sees only what you
are <I>generatim.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
One can readily see
that the poetics of this antiliberalism would encourage a
numbering of the streaks of the tulip, details stripped of
the discursive apparatus that facilitates generalization.
Stirner intended to correct the excesses of intelligence. As
ideas become formulated they acquire, according to Stirner,
an undue power: "with so many a man a thought becomes a
'maxim,' whereby he [man] himself is made prisoner to it, so
that it is not he that has the maxim, but rather it that has
him" (<I>EIO,</I> 67). The discursive forms themselves
empower ideas well beyond their deserts. The rebellion
against this domination of ideas "like right, the State,
law" must take a nihilistic form: "only thoughtlessness
really saves me from thoughts," Stirner argued (<I>EIO,</I>
148). The signs of so-called thoughtlessness in poetry might
well be avoidance of logical connectives, smooth
transitions, explanation in fact of any sort. I am
extrapolating these literary analogues to Stirner's
philosophical views in order to suggest that Imagist poets
had no difficulty seeing their art in Stirnerian terms.

<p>
Marsden's significance for literary history is that she saw
some of the literary implications of Stirner's antistatist
philosophy.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
According to Les Garner, she first
read Stirner's <I>The Ego and Its Own </I>in August 1912,
and this changed everything for her, in particular by
dissolving her faith in the Suffrage Movement. From this
viewpoint, developed by Levenson and K. K. Ruthven,
Marsden's suffrage journal, <I>The New Freewoman, </I>was
taken over in 1914 by Pound, Aldington, and other male
writers who pressed the nonfeminist title, <I>The Egoist,
</I>on her and her co-editor Harriet Shaw
Weaver.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Marsden herself, however, preferred the
title <I>The Egoist, </I>and for her it had a deeper
importance than it could have for her male collaborators. I
believe that she read Stirner before she edited even <I>The
Freewoman </I>(1911-12), the title of which, along with that
of her first editorial on Bondwomen, came from a passage in
Galatians that Stirner cites: "The Jerusalem that is above
is the freewoman; she is the mother of us all" (Gal. 4.26;
<I>EIO, </I>157). Stirner's reference is to the sons of
Abraham, "the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh;
but he of the freewoman was by promise." (Gal. 4.22-23)
Marsden's shift of title to <I>The Egoist </I>entailed no
qualification of her commitment to Stirner's beliefs, though
the connection to the women's movement was less obvious
thereafter. Marsden was a Stirnerite, I believe, as early as
1911, when she initiated her literary career. The Stirnerian
stress of <I>The Egoist </I>was carried over from <I>The New
Freewoman; </I>it came from Marsden, certainly not from
Pound and Aldington, who must have been introduced to
Stirner by Marsden's writings.

<p>
As Mike Weaver notes, "Almost contemporaneously with the
[April 1913] appearance of the Imagist manifestoes in
<I>Poetry, </I>Miss Marsden began [in August 1913] to relate
the doctrines of the new movement to her own philosophical
preoccupations."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<B></B>

 This is
surprising because
she was mistrustful of literature. Although she was educated
in the arts, Jane Lidderdale says, Marsden was uninterested
in literature. "As for EP's poems," she wrote to Harriet
Shaw Weaver in November 1913, "I haven't read 'em. Speak it
not. He is a nice old thing" (<I>DMW, </I>73). Her effort to
commandeer Imagism into her sense of Individualism, or
egoism, was actually opportunistic. She wanted to have a
literary flank to her movement, and Imagism was to be just
that, lending cultural breadth to her brand of feminism, and
claiming for it too the timeliness and fruitfulness of a
philosophy in close touch with the arts.

<p>
Marsden's mistrust of literature derived partly from the
physical persuasiveness of the art. She was suspicious of
the sensuality of even ordinary language, so she had to be
especially wary of poetry. "The hypnotism of sound lulls
sense into accepting a 'thought,' i.e. an error born of
ineffectual thinking, into its categories of existent
things, and giving to it a 'local habitation and a
'name.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Her account of the seductiveness of
language depended upon a late nineteenth-century sense of
the symbolist aesthetic; her remarks resemble Yeats's
altogether sympathetic account in 1900 of the effect of
metrical language: to hush "us with an alluring monotony, .
. . to keep us in that state of perhaps real trance, in
which the mind liberated from the preserve of the will is
unfolded in symbols."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Marsden regarded herself
as deeply antisymbolist in literary as well as political
matters. Symbols distract people from actualities, as she
argued. And symbols, above all words, she recognized, are
the special province of poetry:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A legitimate ambition founded on a legitimate basis--the
Vote. . . . What has happened? She [Mrs. Pankhurst] has
pinioned herself with words--words--words, and these, not
her own. She ventured into the maze of the symbolists, whose
vulturous progeny--the empty concepts--got her!. . . . The
Cause is the empty concept--the fount of all insincerity:
the Cause of the Symbol--the Nothing worked upon by the
Dithyramb.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This comes from Marsden's opening editorial for <I>The New
Freewoman </I>in June 1913, just after Emily Davison had
thrown herself in front of the King's horse at the National
Derby in order to demonstrate on behalf of suffrage. Marsden
felt keenly the death of her old friend as well as the
threat that Mrs. Pankhurst might be killed by the rough
handling that followed arrest and hunger strikes. What could
make such losses seem in any way victories? Poets, in words
and dithyrambs, might try that transformation, but the
friends of Davison and Pankhurst would know better.

<p>
Marsden saw her own work--and that of the poets she
affiliated herself with--as deconstructive:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We are analyzing terms; we believe indeed, that the next
work for the lovers of men is just this analysis of naming.
It will go completely against the grain of civilization, but
straight across culture. . . . All who wield authority, do
it in the name of an idea: equality, justice, love, right,
duty, humanity, God, the Church, the State. Small wonder
therefore if those who sit in the seats of authority look
askance at any tampering with names and ideas.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
The Imagist purge of poetic verbiage, as Marsden understood
it in August 1913, was one part of that systematic effort.
Brevity as a stylistic feature was understood widely as a
fit response to fakery in language. One month later Ford
Maddox Hueffer attributed the general dislike of poetry to
its verbiage and inauthenticity: "We seemed to get from them
[Tennyson, Swinburne, Browning, and Pope] the idea that all
poets must of necessity write affectedly, at great length,
with many superfluous words. . . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
When Pound
wrote in "The Serious Writer" (the first installment of
which displaced Marsden's editorial for <I>The New Freewoman
</I>of 15 October 1913) that the good writer "uses the
smallest possible number of words," he was presupposing a
literary-critical context that had been established by Ford
(a month earlier), but also by Marsden who, a month before
that, gave an antiliberal ideological significance to
laconicism.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Marsden, for her part in this collaboration, quite
deliberately talked about poetry in terms derived from Pound
and based on the experience of Imagist poetry:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The difference [between poetry and prose] is one of brevity,
completeness and finish simply because in poetry all the
evidence of laboratory work is removed; the creaking of the
thinking-machine is not there: it has done its work. Poetry
. . . is brief because it is reduced to the exact
equivalent: it has reached the completeness of knowledge
when its dimensions can be expressed in a
formula.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
She was actually apprehensive of images, as of words; in
fact they were the same to her: "The virtue which inheres in
a word is its potency to create involuntarily the
<I>imaginary image </I>which embodies the meanings of things
in isolation from things as wholes. It releases from the
thing--its <I>concept.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
In 1914 she spoke
of images as indispensible: "Feeling, that is, life, defines
itself into images: they are thinking's raw material without
which to work upon the intellectual process is meaningless.
. . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
What she sensed in Imagist poetry was
an extraordinary rhetorical power--troublesome, in that it
conveys the illusion of essences; but attractive, in that it
might be put to her political uses.

<p>
In 1915, when Pound had temporarily withdrawn from <I>The
Egoist, </I>Marsden used the terms of Imagism to construct a
psychological account of desire itself:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The vital instinct is to follow such sensations as offer
promise of developing themselves into something new: which
said differently, means that life is in its highest
condition of well-being when it is enlarging its world to
include something new. . . .
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that certain Images of the Mind .
. .
suggest the prospect . . . of yielding such experiences, and by them the
mind becomes magnetized. Where such a prospective experience
suggests itself men will harness, concentrate and apply
their energies to the utmost in order to make the more
definite Image eventuate. . . . The genius is the person
capable of great emotions and becomes the Master-Expressor
because great emotions are carried by their own weight and
clarity to the point of expression. He breaks into
Expression, not to obtain Appreciation--Honour--but to gain
an outlet for Images he is unable to retain.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
This account of the psychological force of such images is
designed to support those women and men who refuse to rest
in the forms of social stability offered by Edwardian
society, those who seek, in Pound's terms, "that sense of
sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the
greatest works of art."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Desire leads naturally
away from monogamous marriage, as from the political
proposals of legislators, she argues implicitly, and poetry
tracks the movements of desire.

<p>
The libertarianism of <I>The New Freewoman </I>was not just
an objection to bureaucracy, or even to Fabian idealism; its
authors resisted the pressure to render all decisions
political. "The political view of life has assumed such
gigantic proportions in our minds to-day that, as we have
seen, a lecturer on the Woman's Movement fails to see the
possibility of any progress except through legislation. All
other forms of energy are subordinate to
that."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Socialism and the women's movement were
one in that they both looked to the state to ensure justice
and progress: politics and advocacy of an enlarged state
came to mean the same thing in the prewar years. The
antistatist views of the <I>New Freewoman, </I>on the
contrary, were presented as supposedly antipolitical. One
contributor wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . The Democratic Movement and the Woman's Movement . . .
put the cart before the horse and mistake the power for the
product. They suppose Life and Feelings are the <I>outcome
</I>of just institutions. They are not, they are the
<I>origin </I>of them. When we have all got Life and
Feelings again, we shall get living and sensitive
institutions. What is the use of tinkering with moribund
Politics?
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Individualism, for Marsden, was an effort to locate an area
outside of politics, in "Life and Feelings," a vitalist
alternative to the rise of socialism and the welfare state.
Jonathan Rose shows that Hulme's remark that "all the best
people take off their hats and lower their voices when they
speak of Life" accurately identified "the often monotonous
Edwardian obsession with that simple word."
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
In
response to Christabel Pankhurst's argument for chastity as
the remedy for epidemic venereal disease, Marsden wrote in
1914:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is more important to heighten vitality than to combat
disease: which as a matter of fact can only be overcome by
increased vitality, and there is more danger to "health" to
be awaited from the misery of renunciation and the dull
heats of virginity than from the ills of syphilis and
gonorrhea. . . . The sole thing which can be called a
"cause" of disease is low vitality and of all the things
which tend to lower it, the chief is dullness.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
No other Edwardian exploits the antistatist significance of
the term vitalism that Marsden proposes.

<p>
Her nominalist opposition to abstract terms derived from an
anarchist-libertarian opposition to the state itself, which
in turn entailed a resistance to all notions of
collaboration among individuals. This meant that from the
founding of <I>The New Freewoman </I>in 1913 Marsden was
proselytizing against ideology. At the cost of incoherence,
she refused the very notion of a movement such as
Individualism, exactly 

<B></B>

 because
individuals get lost in
crowds: "Accurately speaking," this one-time suffragette
announced in her first issue, "there <I>is </I>no 'Woman
Movement.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
She dismissed all essentialist
definitions of woman--upon which the suffrage movement
rested--together with political affiliations based upon
essentialist feminism: "'Woman Movement' forsooth. . . .
Woman? Is there such a thing even as a woman sensed from the
inside?"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
The Women's Social and Political
Union showed what institutionalized collaboration might look
like, but more generally socialism was understood as the
state form of collaboration. Opposition to collaboration in
the arts was homologous in some fashion to opposition to
state socialism. One must remember that 1913-14 was a
crucial period in the development of social welfare in
England. Until the war broke out and the British state took
unto itself many new prerogatives, intellectuals debated
what the limits should be to state authority. After 1914 the
force of war and later of precedent rendered this debate
moot.

<p>
Pound's interest in Individualism was not just a way of
conforming to Marsden's enthusiasms, or a casual use of a
current term. He tried to reconcile his affiliations of 1913
and 1914 in terms of just this idea, lest he be thought to
be moving frivolously, in the continental manner, from one
theatrical "ism" to the next. When he wrote his appreciation
of the Vorticist painter Edward Wadsworth in August 1914, he
quickly addressed the subject of the movement that claimed
his allegiance after Imagism had passed into Amygism: "The
vorticist movement is a movement of individuals, for
individuals, for the protection of
individuality."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Pound was far from alone in
his commitment to individualism. Aldington, an editor of
<I>The Egoist </I>in 1914, wrote: "In art the important
thing is the individual. When two individuals agree on a few
points they can raise hell; when ten agree they change the
art history of their century. (In art as in life the rarest
thing is the individual.)" He extended his point by arguing
wrongly but spiritedly that Imagist poetry had a special
angle on individuality (Aldington had not moved on to
Vorticism in 1914):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . I demand that it [free verse] receive as much or more
attention than academic verse on the ground that its use is,
at present, a sign of individuality. . . . For the essential
difference between free verse and accented verse is just
this: the old accented verse forced the poet to abandon some
of his individuality, most of his accuracy and all his style
in order to wedge his emotions into some preconceived and
sometimes childish formality; free verse permits the poet
all his individuality because he creates his cadence instead
of copying other people's, all his accuracy because with his
cadence flowing naturally he tends to write naturally and
therefore with precision, and all his style consists in
concentration, and exactness which could only be obtained

This sentimental explanation of free-verse would not have
been Pound's, but Aldington's efforts show how hard these
writers worked to build a coherent ideology in the prewar
years. Both Pound and Aldington felt the burden of
explaining to London audiences how the confederations of
Imagists and later Vorticists were not bands of theatrical
conformists but rather alliances of "individuals." The
Individualist 

<B></B>

 philosophy had the
special appeal of enabling
a strong defense against the charge of imitating the Italian
Futurists.

<p>
Imagism was the perfect literary parallel for Marsden's
anticollaborative political position, because Pound and
others liked to claim that these poets--unlike the Italian
Futurists--were sufficiently empirical to consider the idea
of a movement and of manifestos somewhat ironically. Only a
"few don'ts," not a manifesto; a matter of technique, not
ideology. "The <I>imagistes </I>admitted," Rebecca West
wrote,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

that they were contemporaries of the Post Impressionists and
the Futurists; but they had nothing in common with these
schools. They had not published a manifesto. They were not a
revolutionary school; their only endeavour was to write in
accordance with the best tradition, as they found it in the
best writers of all time--In Sappho, Catullus,
Villon.

<p>
Neither Marsden nor Pound expressed such sweeping criticism
of art movements; on the contrary, it is extraordinary that
Marsden, who was loosely allied with anarchists, would
publish an essay calling for discipline, or social control.
This dissidence with her views, and those of the journal,
suggest that she was ready to go some way to appeal to a
particular range of London opinion.

<p>
Imagist rhetoric exploited this antitheatrical skepticism
and simultaneously gained some of the cachet of
collaborative movements. The sight of ladies and mothers
demonstrating in the streets was a shocking spectacle to
many bourgeois Londoners of 1913-14, as Lisa Tickner has
shown.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
The spectacle of Marinetti and the
Futurists brought the shock of theatricality to art and
literary circles.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
It was the March 1912
Futurist exhibit at the Sackville Gallery in London that
made English artists see the need to emulate Futurist
publicity methods. Marinetti had read his inaugural 1909
manifesto to a women's group in 1910, but his 1912 lecture
in the Bechstein Hall drew an enormous amount of attention.
Over three hundred and fifty articles were written about the
show. Marinetti returned to London in 1913. Between November
1913 and June 1914, a month before <I>Blast </I>appeared,
Marinetti gave ten lectures to large audiences in
London.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Art, it then seemed, was to be the
function of impressarios and committees. The suffragettes
and the Futurists looked spectacularly vulgar to many
Londoners, including some artists and intellectuals. 

<B></B>

 And in
the music halls it seemed that spectacle was just what the
working class was accustomed to.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The
antitheatrical sentiment that Pound and others exploited had
broad roots in prewar English culture. The women's suffrage
movement, the continental avant-garde, and the working
classes in public looked alike to some Londoners: the image
of one could evoke the memory of the others, through the
experience of spectacle. Imagism was constructed as a
movement against movements, an English antitheatrical
version of the avant-garde.

<p>
So far I have spoken only of the intellectual context of
Imagism; I want now to discuss two pairs of poems by Pound
that address the subject of women, class, and the public
sphere. The first is "The Garden" and "Commission," which
appeared together in <I>Poetry </I>in April 1913, one month
after the issue containing articles on Imagism by Pound and
Flint appeared there. "The Garden" was reprinted in August
in <I>The New Freewoman. </I>These two poems express the
poet's satirical view of bourgeoise British women, that is,
of those social groups that produced the suffrage movement.
The bored, aenemic, and lonely woman in "The Garden" has no
future in the British polis, "In her is the end of
breeding"--which "end" of course cuts both ways, as pinnacle
and cessation. The "rabble," as he says, the very poor,
"shall inherit the earth." Whether she should be able to
vote is entirely beside the point. As Ruthven notes, this
poem is a parody of seventeenth-century promenade poems, in
which "the lady is usually surrounded by flowers, not street
urchins."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Several other Imagist poems bear
similar titles: H.D.'s "The Garden," Aldington's "Au Vieux
Jardin," F. S. Flint's "In the Garden," and Amy Lowell's "In
a Garden" make it clear how much Imagist poetry, however
urban its origins, was focused on the difficulties of
retirement.

<p>
Most Imagist poetry was landscape or nature poetry--this at
a time when the face of London was being transformed by
electrical lighting and trains. Aldington's parody of "The
Garden" pokes fun at Pound for dragging into an Imagist poem
contemporary, urban, vulgar subject matter: "Like an armful
of greasy engineer's-cotton / Flung by a typhoon against a
broken crate of duck's eggs." The Imagist assertion of
access to beautiful landscapes or to the subjects of ancient
Greek poetry was an effective, though implicit, insistence
on the investment of poetry in a world apart from the
structures and constraints of the collective urban life of
England in 1913-14. Politically these constraints were
beginning to be recognized through social legislation such
as the Health Insurance Act of 1911, the Mental Deficiency
Act of 1913, as well as the demonstrations of suffragettes
and workers, such as the striking Welsh miners in 1912. The
new activities of the state, however, are wholly irrelevant
to the prewar Imagist poems, conspicuously so. Most Imagist
poems are committed to the project of transcending the
orders of rationality, talk, negotiation, and politics; this
aspiration is apparent above all in the war poems after
1914. But this is not to indict the Imagists for
escapism--far from it. One can distinguish the retirement
poems of some of the Imagists from those of the Georgians,
because Imagists such as Pound ironically expressed the
desire to retire, as here in "The Garden." After 1914 the
obstacles to retirement became still more frustrating in the
work of the soldier-Imagists, such as Aldington and F. S.
Flint. Aldington's "Living Sepulchres," for 

<B></B>

 instance,
expresses explicitly the impossibility of retiring through
poetry from the trenches. "The Garden" is surely critical of
the classes of women who comprised the political base of the
suffrage movement, but Pound was skeptical too of the
prospect of removal from the political scene of London in
1913; and this was the prospect one Imagist poem after
another tried to brighten. The future of England lay neither
with ancient Greece nor with the British landscapes, but
with the working classes fenced out of the gardens.

<p>
Pound had a shallow sense of the oppression of women,
however moved he was by the suffering of particular women,
like Bride Scratton. In "Commission" he implores his poems
to

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

</BLOCKQUOTE>

These women and others are "the enslaved-by-convention,"
which is to say that indiscretion could set them free. Their
oppressors are despised, but the suggestion is that only by
turning away from the social structure of the family and
domesticity can they liberate themselves. No legislation can
do the job for them.

<p>
The other pair of poems I want to discuss is "Shop Girl" and
"The Tea Shop," which were first published in the New York
avant-garde journal <I>Others </I>in November 1915. As
Ruthven notes, the second line of "Shop Girl"--"Like a
swallow half blown to the wall"--recalls the first line of
"The Garden": "Like a skein of loose silk blown against a
wall." But the press of the young working woman is
deliberate and therefore erotic. None of these four poems is
among Pound's best, but they do show that Pound's admiration
and curiosity were aroused much less by the bourgeoise and
upper-class British women who were advocating the
suffragette cause than by the young working women who were
making their way outside of marriage by selling only their
labor.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
(The women's movement produced rather
few working-class women activists.) Marsden felt that
Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst "favored wealthy, titled
women, not the plain Janes (or Doras) of this
world."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Pound was probably close to the
thinking of his friend Wyndham Lewis on this subject,
because Lewis too made a point of saying in the second issue
of <I>Blast: </I>"BLESS . . . All A.B.C. Tea-Shops (without
exception)."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
"I see every day in a certain
A.B.C. Shop," Lewis wrote, "at least three girls who belong
to a new and unknown race. They would furnish an artist
looking for an origin with the model of a new mankind. And
it would be as individual and apparently strange as that
genre of Englishwoman that attracted
Rossetti."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Lewis too liked watching working
girls, but he was a predatory watcher. According to Marsden,
women could achieve liberation only by economic means;
political enfranchisement would follow when it could be
effective. 

<B></B>

 The vote was something that
would be taken once
women had achieved sufficient economic power to control
their own lives.

<p>
Once writers such as Lewis, Hulme, Gaudier, Aldington, and
others had seen what the proportions of industrial warfare
would be, it was obvious that the modern state would indeed
become much more powerful and interventionist than it had
been in the past. The question that had helped to make the
suffrage movement interesting was settled really. Lewis had
written sarcastically in the first <I>Blast: </I>"We all
foresee . . . in a century or so men and women being put to
bed at 7 o'clock by a state nurse (in separate beds, of
course!)."
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
British Liberals had successfully
passed very controversial health insurance legislation in
1911. In fact, as historians make clear, "A 'social service
state,' in which certain minimum standards were assured, was
now [in 1914] beginning to emerge" (<I>TCM,</I> 30). When
the war was over in 1918 the Representation of the People
Act gave the vote to all men (over forty percent of British
men were without the vote in 1911) and to women over age
thirty. Women were also permitted to take seats in Commons
in 1918. The vote for women over twenty-one did not come
until 1928.

How strange that after the war ended Pound again felt the
pathos of the 1890s. But Pound and Lewis had admired the
utopian ambitions of the Pre-Raphaelites and the avant-garde
of the 1911-14 period was often measured against their
example. More importantly, Pound felt that the British
Liberals were to blame for some of the sufferings of the
Pre-Raphaelites, which is why this poem begins with
reference to the 

<B></B>

 Liberal statesman
Gladstone. When Pound and
Lewis looked at the young working women in the London tea
shops, they thought about Elizabeth Siddall, the
Pre-Raphaelite model, an oppressed woman whom Rossetti
turned into a new ideal of British femininity, as Lewis
said. She was a sign of the power of art to alter a nation's
perception. Pound had a more ironic way of thinking of this
than Lewis could manage. In "The Tea Shop" he says,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Like the poet, that is, she will turn middle-aged; she too
will spread. Will the nation <I>really </I>be altered by
this Helen? Probably the muffins will still come to the
table. And in time we will all be well-spread. Pound had his
apocalyptic moments, but the shop girls also aroused his
urbanity.

<p>
 One of the satellite controversies around the suffrage
question involved the rights of prostitutes and their
clients, or of eroticism in the public economy. The
essentialist feminism of the WSPU predicted a higher moral
tone for Britain after women won the vote. Christabel
Pankhurst's campaign against prostitution and venereal
disease was taken as a sign of what could be expected after
women began to vote. The controversy about prostitution
actually bore indirectly on the question of the power of
art. Pound translated a series of Fontenelle's dialogues for
<I>The Egoist, </I>beginning in May 1916; the first of these
is between Phrine, a courtesan, and Alexander the Great. At
issue is the relative power of beautiful women and
illustrious warriors. "Beauty has a natural right to command
men," Phrine argues; "valour has nothing but a right
acquired by force. A beautiful woman is of all countries,
yet kings themselves and even conquerors are
not."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Phrine cites the example of another
beautiful Phrine, the mere glimpse of whose face swayed the
court of the Areopagus after oratory had failed. Phrine the
Younger gets the better of Alexander on a number of counts,
but she concedes that she had been excessive (though so had
he), in taking so many lovers that she could afford to
rebuild the walls of Thebes. Two or three affairs would have
been reasonable. "But if one wishes merely to make a
commotion," she concludes, "one may be better equipped than
by possessing a very reasonable character."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
Phrine chose excess, as beauty does. The irrepressible
authority of beauty is exactly what Pound's poems express,
particularly the early Cantos and his most famous Imagist
poem, "In a Station of the Metro."
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
A number of
Imagist poems could be listed under this thematic heading:
Aldington's "A Girl," H.D.'s "Sitalkas," F. S. Flint's
"Beggar," Pound's "Alba" and "A Girl." Pound was close to
the center of conventional views of gender in these years.
Like any number of his contemporaries, he represents beauty
as a woman--the two were commonly synonymous. The narrator
of Virginia Woolf's <I>Jacob's Room </I>, for
instance, says: 

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
As for the beauty of women, it is like the light on the sea,
never constant to a single wave. They all have it; they all
lose it. . . . The women in the streets have the faces of
playing cards; the outlines accurately filled in with pink
or yellow, and the line drawn tightly round them. Then, at a
top-floor window, leaning out, looking down, in a
ditch--beauty glowing, suddenly expressive, withdrawn the
moment after. No one can count on it or seize it or have it
wrapped in paper. . . . Thus if you talk of a beautiful
woman you mean only something flying fast which for a second
uses the eyes, lips, or cheeks of Fanny Elmer, for example,
to glow through.

<p>
What Hugh Kenner has called a modernist aesthetic of
glimpses was understood in its time as bearing some special
appropriateness to the depiction of women.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
The
history of Imagism is tied to the history of the women's
movement through Marsden and <I>The New Freewoman; </I>this
is a matter of straight-forward literary history. But
Imagism is also tied to the women's movement formally by
constraining itself to the moment, which was often
understood in this period to be exactly where women revealed
themselves. Women were thought to be outside of the
continuities established by male authority: the principles
and instances enforced by the legal system, or the premises
and conclusions established by syllogisms. Women were not
represented in these early years of modernism as the
traditional source of stability--earthly and so forth--but
rather as just the reverse. That conspicuous woman at the
end of a paragraph in <I>Jacob's Room </I>"who has come home
drunk and cries all night long, 'Let me in! Let me in!'" is
the pathetic rather than the epiphanic version of this
representation.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Her husband has presumably
locked her out of her home, just as women in the street
behind her are shown to have been locked out of the British
Museum. They were eliminated from the structures of
continuity by men, and celebrated for their beauty as they
appeared to poets like Pound and Williams in fleeting
glances. Woman (or beauty) was the supposed thing itself,
beyond categories of understanding and desire. Whether one
could think outside of ideology and whether one could see a
woman were one question: "One wonders," Aldington wrote, "if
ever it will fall within Mr. Wells' capacity during his
present sojourn on earth to look directly at a woman--any
woman--Countess, High School Mistress, or the One who does
his cars and see in her something more than a peg to hang
his passing views on."
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
From this point of
view, prostitutes are neither victims of social and economic
oppression nor the agents of moral corruption. They control
their impact on men and keep their sexual encounters
brief--like glimpses. They are the masters, or mistresses,
of the erotics of the glimpse.

<p>
In Pound's first translation of Fontenelle, despite the
facetious tone of Phrine's argumentation, the implicit
question is how stable a government can be that does not
draw its power from the sources that empower art: women,
beauty, sudden visions. Pound, like Marsden, was outspokenly
antiparliamentarian: "He [the artist] knows he is born to
rule but he has no intention of trying to rule by general
franchise. He at least is born to the purple. He is not
elected by a system of plural voting."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
This extraordinary bluster rests on the serious claim that
artists command cultural resources that might indeed
overturn states: the belief of people in sudden
illumination, 

<B></B>

 transcendent beauty. These might
be resources
that a ruler or government would wish to exploit in order to
retain power. Artists indeed might "rule" in the sense that
those values they uphold and, perhaps more importantly, the
representatives of those values, women, could gain much
greater sway over the political life of England after 1914,
but not by means of suffrage, which Pound like Lewis
supported indifferently.

<p>
Part of what is called artistic license is the right to
represent women as licentious, as creatures of passion.
Fontenelle's Dido complains to the Syrian queen Stratonice
that Virgil made her a flirt, whereas she was in fact
fidelity itself. Stratonice answers this complaint with the
story of a painter who, "discontented" with her, took
revenge before leaving town by painting her in the arms of a
common soldier. "As I was painted admirably well and with a
great deal of beauty," she tells Dido, "--although the
attitude was scarcely creditable to my virtue--I forbade
them [Syrian subjects] the burning [of the painting], had
the painter recalled and pardoned him."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
The
political power of women, art, and beauty resolves to one
force, unconstrained by prudence or rationality. Aristotle
is Fontenelle's avatar of rationality. His counterpart
Anacreon tells him plainly that philosophy is easy because
it leaves out women and the experience of the passions: "A
philosopher is concerned only with men and by no means with
the rest of the universe." Poets, drinkers, and lovers take
the greater risks: "To sing and to drink, as I [Anacreon]
did, required that one should have disentangled one's soul
from violent passions; that we should not aspire to things
not dependent upon us, that we be ready always to take time
as we find it."
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The implicit Imagist counsel
to women was to accept and exploit a sphere (that of art and
beauty) separate from state politics. Individualists like
Marsden and Pound hoped that the prerogatives of the state
might be so circumscribed as to leave room for a separate
sphere that would not be trivial.

<p>
My argument about the politics of Imagism, I think, has
significant consequences for our understanding of Pound's
development and of the politics of modernism generally. For
it is clear that Pound in 1913-14 was vehemently
antistatist, and anti-socialist. It is hard to imagine how
an anti-statist politics would lead to the politics of state
totalitarianism, though that was the path that Pound took
and, I believe, that Mussolini took as well. In Pound's case
it is difficult even to use the term "development" to cover
these two positions. His political development seems to have
brought a direct contradiction of his earlier anarchist
Individualism. What follows from this observation, I think,
is that, contra Davie, "the development from imagism in
poetry to fascism in politics" is anything but "clear and
unbroken."
