<p>One would assume that in its "originary" internationalism, modernist studies today is something of a naturally, even organically comparative field of literary studies; and that it is curious, then, that only with the recent rise of something [<span style="font-style:italic;">lse</span> supplemental to or superseding internationalism, called transnationalism (and "transnational studies") that relationships between European and non-European modernist movements have begun to be analyzed both conspicuously and rigorously. Whether we take it as the fullest development of a globalizing project always already implicit within modernist studies, or as an innovative new turn in the field, this displacement seems to draw on the idea of both material and reciprocal imaginary connection at scales and across greater distances than might previously have been accepted as plausible. Still, any such expansion of a field is bound to have both its creative and its critical exponents, and it is possible to discern at least two major strains of the new transnationalist modernist studies today. While one tendency among scholars and critics working on the edge of the field is to re-read from modernism not only the "international," but the full-blown global travel of modernist aesthetic forms and movements, another is to turn (or return) to the study of literatures in their particularized locality, continuing a critique of the parochialism of canonical Europeanist modernism and modernist studies.</p>
<p>A recent and invaluable contribution to the first area, for example, traces the "traffic in manifestos" across trans-European and transatlantic travel routes, sketching the elusive re of "an international avant-garde … at large."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> For Martin Puchner, translocalization of the art of the manifesto expresses both the mobility and the diffusion of the modernization project in avantgarde<span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rather than "the" avant-garde; what it resists, meanwhile, is the seldom explicit, yet often tacit and conventional critical ration of <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> single world modernization project. Such scholars as Dubravka Djurić, Miško Šuvaković, and Miryam Sas, on the other hand, have "comparatized" modernist studies by documenting the heterogeneity of literary modernisms that those very res of traffic and circulation can (if not in Puchner's own careful analysis) tend to obscure. In their collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Impossible Histories: Historical Avant-Gardes, Neo-Avant-Gardes, and Post-Avant-Gardes in Yugoslavia 1918-1991</span> , Djurić and Šuvaković particularize <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> comparison the richly diverse aesthetic cultures of Zagreb, Belgrade, and Ljubljana, in a Balkans-within-Europe disavowed as Europe's other.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In her study of Japanese surrealism, meanwhile, Sas (in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fault Lines: Cultural Memory and Japanese Surrealism)</span> argues for the value of surrealist juxtaposition—of distant, particular or local realities—as a model for transcultural exchange.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> In Sas's work it is Japanese, rather than European surrealism which finds the historical limits of critical models for intercultural influence. "Here," she writes of a specifically "Japanese" practice of surrealism, "the 'West' becomes a space that transcends its 'real' position and begins to function as an ideal place, a place that provides material for the Japanese writers' poetic encounters, as well as a screen upon which their fantasies may be projected."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My goal in what follows is to supplement these new gestures of and <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> comparison, in both modes. My contribution is a reading of the Turkish encounter with surrealism recorded and dramatized in a unique essay by critic Ismayıl Hakkı Baltacıoğlu (1886-1978). <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> ("Turkish Script Arts"; 1958), I will suggest here, maps a complexly refracted intersection of Western European and Turkish literary histories, one which we might think as exemplary in its very frustration of the exemplarity on which comparison, very conventionally, depends.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>A "socio-psychological essay on the graphology and the aesthetics of Turkish script arts," to take the work's subtitle, Baltacıoğlu's book-length essay contrasts "Turkish Islamic writing" with the geometric abstraction of Latin letters, proposing a comparative anatomy of the two Turkish alphabets used during the twentieth century. Cataloging the Arabo-Persian letters used in Ottoman Turkish, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> Baltacıoğlu reads each letter of the pre-1928 alphabet as the scriptural paradox of a non-rative representation of the human body arranged in an expressive pose. (The essay is supplemented and illustrated with photographs, diagrams, and charts designed to assist the reader in transvisualizing Arabo-Persian lettering into human forms.) My suggestion will be that what the essay performs is not a comparison merely internal to the national cultural history of modern Turkey, but rather a kind of extant record of a transnational comparative literary modernity. The author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> argues that the non-rative representation he reads in Turkish Islamic letters anticipates elements of European surrealist art practice in the early twentieth century, and he does so in terms that make comparison explicit—though as a kind of West-East comparison "in reverse," in a substantive defamiliarization of that comparison's ground.</p>
<p>My point will be that Baltacıoğlu's "alliance" (or dalliance) with surrealism cannot be understood as part of a (smaller or larger) Turkish "surrealist movement," and that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this is precisely why it is interesting. Where the Turkish cultural scene of the early 49 1930s included no shortage of avant-garde formations (such as the notorious "d Group") whose goal was to remake Turkish art using imported cubist, constructivist, and expressionist techniques, Baltacıoğlu aimed instead for a reconciliation or even continuity of European surrealist style with traditional Turkish art practices. Neither the artifact of an obscured and lost local avant-garde <span style="font-style:italic;">scene</span>, nor an exemplar of and in some global surrealist circuit, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> suggests a mode of singularity we might use to re-evaluate the very epistemological categories of comparative literary history.</p>
<p>In advancing this argument, I will situate <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> in the context of the radical alphabet reform of the modern Turkish republic. The reform of 1928 replacing Arabo-Persian lettering with Latin phonetic orthography was one component of the state modernization project modeled on European enlightenment principles. This reform succeeded, we could say, in secularizing and rationalizing the medium of writing. Baltacıoğlu's reading of human form in Turkish Islamic lettering performs a struggle, very much characteristic of this tumultuous period of linguistic modernization, between this modernizing desacralization and a consequent or concurrent <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span>sacralization of writing. <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, I will suggest, opens itself to the fundamental ambiguities in the rationalizing processes of modernity, including that rationalizing process at the heart of critical comparison itself. And one consequence of pushing these ambiguities will perhaps be the collapse of hierarchical models for comparing Turkey with and to an always already "surrealist Europe"—revealing a ground of comparison for "Europe" and "Turkey" as comparable sites of and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">crisis</span> of modernity. Now that recent criticism has recovered comparative literature's quasi-European, "marginal" origin, in Leo Spitzer and Erich Auerbach's exilic years of teaching in Turkey, we might turn to the work of someone like Baltacıoğlu—dismissed from his post at the Istanbul <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun</span> (Istanbul University) during the 1933 university reform that brought Spitzer and Auerbach there—for another comparative history.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Anatomy of Alphabets</h1>
<p>A calligrapher and journal editor,<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> as well as an academic, Ismayıl Hakkı Baltacıoğlu published extensively on the history of Turkish script arts during a long career spanning four crucial periods of modern Turkish history.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> As what we might consider a mosaic of writing's different temporalities, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> incorporates sections of Baltacıoğlu's earlier essays from these different periods.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> This compound temporality of the text is itself a testament to the complex history of Turkish linguistic modernization, about which I want first to review some important details.</p>
<p>An admixture of Turkish with Persian and Arabic vocabulary, written in a script combining Arabic and Persian letter forms,<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Ottoman Turkish had been the "high" written language of the literati and the state since the fourteenth century, its cultivated use the product of intense training.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The politics of its differentiation from vernacular Turkish were complex well before the twentieth century and the republican period I focus on here, and proposals to simplify the language and to reform its orthography had  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> been made as early as the mid-nineteenth-century, with the spread of print technologies and the rapid mass distribution of printed materials. These proposals included the introduction of new vocalization diacritics designating each distinct vowel sound, as well as spacing the letters of each word individually, instead of writing joined script.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>It was during the republican period, however, that the most radical measures were taken. After its emergence from the Ottoman imperial core in 1923, the Turkish republic launched a project of state-led social engineering that sought to replace all Ottoman-Islamic institutions with institutions modeled on those of Western Europe. Within a few years of the birth of the republic, the caliphate had been abolished, religious schools and courts had been shut, and the wearing of traditional clothing had been banned. Scholars of Turkish politics have described this positivist and rationalist revolutionary project as a "non-European will to civilization" in a Muslim setting.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The Turkish language itself became a crucial technology for the discipline of modern national Turkish subjects, as the republic abolished altogether the Arabo-Persian lettering of the Ottoman alphabet, replacing it with Latin letters in 1928, and began a systematic purge of Arabic and Persian words from the language during the 1930s.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>As a witness to this complex history, Baltacıoğlu attempted to memorialize the history of Turkish script arts at a time when they were being marginalized by the modernization programs. His reproduction, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, of the following passage from his own "Türk Yazılarının Tetkikine Methal" ("An Introduction to the Examination of Turkish Scripts," 1927) emphasized a long-held desire to archive this history:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>My consciousness of Turkish script arts is not made of abstract words and concepts; it's a live one produced by my whole being and personality. It's true that after studying natural sciences in the science department at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun</span>,<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> I became a teacher. This diversion distanced me from calligraphy and other works of intuition. It was as if there was an opposition between the thinking of child, school, method, and breeding [<span style="font-style:italic;">terbiye</span>] and of line [<span style="font-style:italic;">satır</span>] and composition [<span style="font-style:italic;">istif</span>]. I gradually found myself leaving my former interests for my new career. But one longing, one desire kept preoccupying me. And this was to write a history of Turkish script arts, which had woven my taste.</p>
<div class="attrib">([<span style="font-style:italic;">YS</span>, 85)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Excepting some simplification of word choice, the passage incorporated into [<span style="font-style:italic;">ürklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> is substantively identical to that in the 1927 essay. Yet Baltacıoğlu makes no explicit reference to that essay or to its 1934 reprint (though he does so in other sections of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, when quoting it directly).<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> This arguably unconscious repetition might be said to mark the persistence of the memory-trace of a displaced writing practice. At the same time, as repetition, it points also to the difficulty of memorialization itself, which more often entails revisiting the traces of the past—as a kind of "circling" them—than successfully restoring them. In Baltacıoğlu's case, the project of memorialization was made all the more difficult by the reforms, and it was 1958 before he managed to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> as a kind of comparative anatomy of the Latin and Arabo-Persian alphabets.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>On the whole, we can say, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> argues from a conservative nationalist position, aiming to restore traditional cultural practices to the "spiritual creative  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> life" of the new nation: "to steer Turkish modernization," as Nazım İrem has put it, "through a new vision of conservative modernity."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Baltacıoğlu belonged to a group of republican intellectuals who turned to the "other West" of romanticism, spiritualism, and Bergsonism, in critique of the materialism of the modernization project.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> For Baltacıoğlu, cultural practices have a timeless and unchanging living essence, and nationhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">milliyet)</span> is constituted by a fixed cultural tradition (<span style="font-style:italic;">gelenek) (TYS</span>, 79). The study of language, as a sediment of traditional social forms, consequently advances the cause of transhistorical and unified traditional social value (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 84).</p>
<p>Still, Baltacıoğlu's positions contain nuances, or perhaps outright contradictions, that are worth noting. While he resisted the positivistic rationalism of the state's nationalization programs, he also had an anti-Ottoman cultural nationalist agenda of his own. Baltacıoğlu's anti-Ottomanism is evident in his identification of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet as "Turkish Islamic." One goal of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, we must note, is to posit a mythic Turkishness uncontaminated by Arabic or Persian influence. For Baltacıoğlu, Turkish Islamic script writing is an essentially somatic and gestural, as well as a communicative activity: in the training and active practice of Turkish calligraphers, he tells us (unlike that of Arabic calligraphers), the shapes of letters were schematically linked to parts of the human body. Turkish calligraphers, Baltacıoğlu argues, had an elaborate vocabulary for letter anatomy, referring to the "head, eyebrow, eye, nose, foot, stomach," and so on of a letter (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 19). This is an Islamic tradition extending back into and from mystical theories of writing as far as the fourteenth century, in the Hurufi formulations of Fadlullah of Astarabad (1339-1394),<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> with both Ottoman court and Sufist poetic traditions making extensive use of similes comparing the beloved with lettering shapes.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, Baltacıoğlu literalizes and extends this metaphoric anatomical language—for example, finding "the sideways profile of a standing man" in the long vertical line of the letter <span style="font-style:italic;">elif (TYS</span>, 17). <span style="font-style:italic;">Fe</span> is "a man looking down in a sitting position, [while] <span style="font-style:italic;">vav</span> resembles a man stretching his feet" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 17). <span style="font-style:italic;">Ayın, kaf, he, mim, dal</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span> are similarly assimilated to expressive human bodily posture. One page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> provides a photograph of a framed inscription, or <span style="font-style:italic;">levha</span>, which reads "Ah mine'l aşk ve halâtihi / Ahraka kalbî bi hararatihi" ("Woe upon love and its states / Burns my heart with its heat").<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In and through the pictorial qualities of Turkish Islamic script, Baltacıoğlu reads what we might call either illuminations or ideograms of Arabic: <span style="font-style:italic;">Ah</span>, an exclamation of grief and longing, is embodied by the letters <span style="font-style:italic;">elif</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span>, the former resembling a standing man, the latter the head of a person weeping (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 18-19).</p>
<p>We should note that this alphabetic pictography neither represents nor replicates purportedly actual forms of the human body. Nor, however, is it entirely emptied of all representational function (or pretense to such function)—as are, for example, the contrasting, "geometrically abstract" Latin letters (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 17). "[This writing] is not a naturalist [<span style="font-style:italic;">naturalist</span>], realist [<span style="font-style:italic;">realist</span>] picture but a surrealist [<span style="font-style:italic;">sürrealist</span>] one," Baltacıoğlu observes. "Like the humans in Picasso's paintings, these letter forms are at once inside and outside nature. The letters and the human forms are not exact replicas  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of each other; they only share a resemblance … Turkish artists were the originators of surrealism [<span style="font-style:italic;">sürrealizm</span>] in writing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 26). Congruent with the goals of the European art practices of cubism and surrealism, for Baltacıoğlu Turkish Islamic writing provides what we might think as non-mimetic representations. And it is precisely this, I want to argue, that makes <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> an unthought or undiscussed kind of record of comparative literary modernity <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> methodology.</p>
<p>Contrasting non-mimetically "human" Turkish Islamic writing with the abstract geometry of Latin letters, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> poses the problem of a mechanized writing and a disenchanted language, in writing emptied of content and transformed into algebraic form.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> If the goal of the alphabet reform was to rationalize writing, establishing a purely arbitrary, abstract relation between meaning and written sign, it was certainly a success. And while such abstraction is arguably an immanent property of all writing systems, the sudden conversion to a new alphabet, I want to argue, created an acutely conscious experience of the gap between the signifier and the signified, and the visual and the aural. The "surreality," in this sense, of Turkish Islamic writing is its writing through and beyond the realm of appearance, past or beneath the geometrically flat plane of Latin orthography. For Baltacıoğlu, Turkish script arts give us surreal representations of "human language," of the human <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> language—surreality in letter and in world being constituted as remote formal resemblance, rather than pictographic mimesis.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the conservative drive in Baltacıoğlu's project, its movement "backward," seeking to preserve a writing through and below the realm of appearance, where it may be at one with the world itself. At the same time, in Baltacıoğlu's comparative invocation of European surrealist art practice, we see the drive to reconcile what he understood as the unified writing of the past with the modern present. In this, we could say, Baltacıoğlu makes a paradoxical movement from modernity forward into tradition, rather than a regression backward or "recovery" of tradition.</p>
<p>This was a singular gesture. As Duygu Köksal has noted, the single-party system in republican Turkey promoted in the 1930s and 1940s a national art "born out of the realistic representation of the nation-people in their ways of life and tastes, of the national landscape, as well as of the Republican reforms."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Some leading Turkish artists and poets did turn to European modernist trends as an alternative: the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet Ran, for example, adds a brief but important chapter to the history of Russian futurism, and the members of the "d Group" founded by Nurullah Berk, Abidin Dino, and Cemal Tollu (among others) in 1933 introduced post-impressionist techniques to Turkish painting. (The journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Ar</span>, published by the "d Group," set out to theorize a conceptual art inappropriable for nationalist propaganda.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Like others in the Turkish avant-garde, Baltacıoğlu had affirmed surrealism and cubism as important movements in his writings since the early 1930s.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Where the members of "d Group" were absorbed by the national cultural establishment by the 1940s, however, Baltacıoğlu's traditionalist avant-gardism retained its marginality.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Doubtless, this was partly due to Baltacıoğlu's freer interpretation of these movements' potential  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> legacies. Using the terms and categories "cubism" and "surrealism" interchangeably, 53 the third chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> contains a brief historical account of their emergence, with praise for their liberation of art from subservience to nature (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 21). But Baltacıoğlu did not himself go seeking a break with nature that would be absolute; in his reading, it was Picasso and Juan Gris, rather than Albert Gleizes, who pointed in the correct direction, refusing either to imitate nature <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> to completely break with it (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 24). Picasso's cubist "disration" of human form is read not as anti-humanist, but rather as resituating the human at the center of art (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 22).</p>
<p>One may certainly take issue with this distortive gesture (as well as to Baltacıoğlu's conflation of cubism with surrealism), but the role it plays in Baltacıoğlu's work, I want to argue, is something of a purposeful misunderstanding. <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> deploys surrealism in an attempt to reconcile traditional art practice with modernist aesthetics, and this is precisely the point where Baltacıoğlu leaves the Turkish avant-garde proper behind. Baltacıoğlu is not out to cultivate or reproduce a European trend in the Turkish scene, and so he re-describes surrealism as a metaphysics <span style="font-style:italic;">inherent</span> in Turkish Islamic writing.</p>
<p>One of Baltacıoğlu's motives here was to counterpose an aesthetic of Turkish Islamic writing to European Orientalist art historians (in particular, Louis Hourticq) who had characterized Islamic arts as resistant to pictorial representation (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 21-22). For Baltacıoğlu, the surrealist aesthetic constructed by twentieth-century Europeans is only a repetition of "[t]he Turkish art genius," which "has at all times manifested … a surrealist genius" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 25). Turkey, he claims, is the true originator of the surrealist aesthetic in art, architecture, and theater (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 25). If this rather preposterous claim risks merely <span style="font-style:italic;">reversing</span> the terms of traditionally hierarchical comparison, it's also true that the reversal, like the affiliation by which it is mediated, is obviously highly unstable, and it is this instability that I want to emphasize here.</p>
<p>What is valuable in surrealism for <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı?</span> The surrealists explored alternative modes of seeing at a time when classical models of vision had collapsed—when visual experience had assumed "an unprecedented mobility and exchangeability, abstracted from any founding site or referent" with the "final dissolution of a transcendent foundation for vision."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Against modernity's new disciplinary technologies, which sought to normalize this "liberated" subjective vision, the surrealist commitment to represent the subjective world opens a plane of the real beyond or "above" objective materiality, transparency, and instrumental abstraction. The phrases which knock at André Breton's window in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifeste du surréalisme</span> of 1924, and the swinging or half-open doors of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nadja</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Vases communicants</span> find remote analogues, we might say, in Baltacıoğlu's gaze into a wavy sea reflecting "the playful face of a writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">celî</span> style smiling" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 37)<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet where for Breton the surreal is marked by childlike or mad freedom "exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern,"<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> for Baltacıoğlu it is marked by ethical human values: beauty, religiosity, sociability, helpfulness, love (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 23, 81). Where Breton theorizes the surreal as the reconciliation of dream and reality in the play of chance,<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Baltacıoğlu sees it as a modern manifestation of divine order. Finally, where Breton  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> at times vacillates between privileging the visual or writing as the more immediate manifestation of the (sur)real, Baltacıoğlu seeks a surreal pictography unifying all such discrete sensibilities.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> It is not the coincidence of Turkish script arts (and <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı)</span> with surrealism, then, but rather their "missed encounter," as Baltacıoğlu saw it, that is my interest here, because it shows us what is at stake in these forms of comparison. The surrealist exercise of juxtaposition, of placing distant realities in contact, is itself a re for a Europe <span style="font-style:italic;">torn</span> by the violence of modernity (of that to which surrealism itself attempts to answer)—not for Europe as the <span style="font-style:italic;">telos</span> of the modern, which a "Turkish surrealism" can only ever follow. Baltacıoğlu's surrealist alliance exposes both "Europe" and "Turkey" as heterogeneous sites of the crisis of the modern, shifting the ground of comparison, we might say, from hierarchy to crisis itself.</p>
<p>In an unpublished early essay from the late 1920s, "La <span style="font-style:italic;">'vieille taupe'</span> et le préfixe <span style="font-style:italic;">sur</span> dans les mots <span style="font-style:italic;">surhomme</span> et <span style="font-style:italic;">surréaliste</span>" ("The 'Old Mole' and the Prefix <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span> in the Words <span style="font-style:italic;">Surhomme</span> [Superman] and <span style="font-style:italic;">Surrealist</span>"), Georges Bataille critiques the "double tendency" of surrealism, which in his analysis, re-invests the low or base vulgarity of life—"the unconscious, sexuality, filthy language"—with higher values (the <span style="font-style:italic;">"spirit, surreal, absolute</span>, etc.").<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> For Bataille, surrealism was fundamentally a failed poetic revolution: the prefix <span style="font-style:italic;">sur-</span> in "surrealism" marks this attachment to lofty value, what Bataille calls the "Icarian flight" of bourgeois revolt. Bataille's critique of Breton can certainly be applied to Baltacıoğlu, whose search for the sur-real in sacred language is fundamentally a failure to confront the alienation of modernity directly. And yet as I have argued, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> makes fruitful reading not <span style="font-style:italic;">despite</span> but <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> it manifests the contradictions of modernity, in failing to resolve those contradictions. It is those contradictions, and the failure to resolve them, which nuance our genealogies of the modern.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, Baltacıoğlu's project to preserve the sacred language of the past appeals to explanatory <span style="font-style:italic;">devices</span> including those of modern media—his anatomy of alphabets making ample use of organized charts and diagrams, as well as photographs providing "evidence." Against Baltacıoğlu's intentions, we might say, such diagrams, which measure each letter by the "dot" of the calligrapher's pen point, reveal a mechanicity inherent in the writing of the past, and point to a remote kinship between Latin and "Turkish Islamic" writing, rather than their opposition (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 95, 96, 99).</p>
<p>At the same time, literalizing the anatomical metaphors of Turkish calligraphy, Baltacıoğlu gives us a taxonomy of human res corresponding to letters, in a way exposing the insurmountability of the gap between poetic and literal functions of language. Against its own intentions, <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> demonstrates the impossibility of preserving a unified "sacred" language in the modern present.</p>
<p>For finally, Baltacıoğlu's chart of transvisualized letters has more to say about the abstraction and individualization of modernity than about the human sacrality of Turkish Islamic writing it purports to argue and illustrate. The chart flattens a unitary, divine language onto a two-dimensional grid, incarcerating each letter in an individual cell of the grid. Here, the round curves of the Turkish Islamic alphabet, which Baltacıoğlu counterposed to the linear geometry of Latin letters, vanish into the straight lines of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> grid. The chart's spacing is a visual metaphor for the epistemic violence of modernity and its reorganization of space through the new disciplinary technologies of school, army, and state.</p>

</div>
<p>What these drawings of emptied human forms expose, then, is finally not the "human nature" of Turkish Islamic writing, but the spectralization of writing dissociated from bodily presence. Here, writing is no longer the mark of a hand. The reformed way of writing, performed sitting at a desk Western-style, attenuates the somatic engagement of traditional writing, in which "[c]alligraphers sat on sofas or cushions with their right knee raised and with the paper resting against the knee, a position that kept the paper perpendicular to the calligrapher's line of sight."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The reproducibility of the printed text of <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> itself, traveling as intended through modern space and time, only further attenuates the presence of its author. Surveying a variety of script styles by different calligraphers, Baltacıoğlu has emphasized the intermediate, mediating position of the body between writer and text in Turkish Islamic writing. But the very method  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of emphasis <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> withdraws the body from this intermediate position. At the end, we are left with a chart of emptied, nongendered, spectral bodies, not mediators so much as markers of the materiality of an arbitrary, formalized and standardized writing. The body, previously imbricated in the act of writing, is now externalized, its void re standing behind the letter as a mere shadow—its writing hands and arms missing (or closed in on itself), the body prepared for utilization in army and factory.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> As a kind of negative of the modern present, Baltacıoğlu's emptied interiorities trace the Turkish subject's <span style="font-style:italic;">disappearance</span> into the new writing, more than anything else.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span> thus performs the failure of its own traditionalism. At the same time, the essay performs the historical failure of the language reforms, after a brief and "catastrophic success,"<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> to abolish Turkish Islamic writing entirely: uncannily, the letters of the old alphabet come to life again here, more surreal than real. For Baltacıoğlu, the anatomy of each letter is an index to its character and destiny (<span style="font-style:italic;">alınyazısı</span>) (<span style="font-style:italic;">TYS</span>, 31). Letters can be "tense," "shy," or "brave" , social or anti-social . A letter "becomes a man" when it relates proportionately to adjacent letters, forming a society ; disproportionate relations, Baltacıoğlu suggests, produce anarchy . These anthropomorphized letters violate modernity's ontological distinction between human and nonhuman, animate and inanimate, poetic and literal, leaving us with the specifically doubled form of undecidability that Freud called the uncanny. Like the dead come to life, the abolished script of the past returns with new spells.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Literary Modernity</h1>
<p>If the critical discourses of modernism and modern (national) literature are useful for reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanatı</span>, neither can provide us with capacious enough a ground of comparison, I have argued, for Baltacıoğlu's singular encounter with surrealism. The broader re of literary modernity, on the other hand, in its powers of reference to simultaneously entwined and disparate histories of literatures between and within it, combines a sensitivity to internal difference with a complementary sensitivity to external relation, and gives us something of what is valuable in the new "transnational modernist studies." No universal content can be assigned to the term or concept "modernity," which is appropriated and used toward for many different goals.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> (The differences in Baltacıoğlu and Breton's political orientations are proof of that.)</p>
<p>"Literary modernity" gives us the breadth needed to link the linguistic/literary and the socio-economic domains without reducing or subordinating one domain to the other. In one way or another, we can say, much literary historiography tends to reproduce the distinction between "modernity" as economic, political, and technological change and "modernism" at large as the reflection of that change (affirmatively or negatively) in the arts. This conventional distinction confines the question of representational language to the domain of autonomous <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> history, where modernist experimentation at large can be explained as revolt, for example, against literary realism or romanticism. It can be very difficult to break with this way of limiting the question. Yet modernity is not only the generalization of the commodity form, but a generalization of language itself.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> While as Paul de Man argued in "Literary History and Literary Modernity," abstraction is an immanent property of language, one might say that the diverse technologies of capitalist modernity intensify its immanence, or lend it intensified significance.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In the case of the Turkish language reforms, change at the broader economic, political, and technological level cannot merely be said to be "reflected" in literature, since it transforms <span style="font-style:italic;">the very medium in which literature is created.</span></p>
<p>Literary modernity is defined by the desire to break away from oneself, spatially and temporally: "to wipe out whatever came earlier, in the hope of reaching at last a point that could be called a true present, a point of origin that marks a new departure."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Within Baltacıoğlu's missed encounter with European surrealism, we might contemplate an historical space within which the boundary between modern Turkish literature and European modernism begins to break down. Often taken to signify rigid and irreconcilable cultural difference, that boundary may already be more permeable than one wants to admit.</p>

With the notable exception of Nâzim Hikmet, the Kemalist regime generally tolerated "imports" of European aesthetic trends, since it ft the agenda for cultural modernization. "By the time its members began to enter the cadres of the Fine Arts Academy towards the 1940s," she writes, "the D Group had become part of the cultural establishment in Republican Turkey" ("Art and Power," 104).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f25" href="#f25-text">25. </a>Baltacioğlu's comparison of Turkish Islamic arts with cubism may be traced back to his earlier articles "Mimaride Kübizm ve Türk Ananesi" ("Cubism in Architecture and the Turkish Tradition"), <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun Ilahiyat Fakültesi Mecmuasi</span> 3, no. 11 (April 1929): 110-131, and "Resimde Kübizm ve Türk Ananesi" ("Cubism in Painting and Turkish Tradition"), <span style="font-style:italic;">Darülfünun İlahiyat Fakültesi Mecmuasi</span> 5, no. 19 (March 1931): 33-48, as well as his 1931 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span> ("Democracy and Art") (Istanbul: Kanaat Kütüphanesi, 1931). In these early writings, Baltacioğlu uses the term "cubism" primarily to describe the non-mimetic art of Picasso, Gris, and others. As he writes in the dedication to <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span>, Baltacioğlu's goal here is to reconcile "'Lyricism and Machinism'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Lirizm ve Mas¸inizm</span>). Cubism, for Baltacioğlu, embodies the reconciliation of these two value-systems, in the creative art of contemporary democracies—originating not from the exterior world of nature, but from human consciousness, and standing for modern individualism (<span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi</span> 125-126). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Demokrasi ve Sanat</span>, Baltacioğlu aims explicitly to internationalize what he regards as a national culture (142-144). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Türklerde Yazı Sanati,</span> on the other hand, one sees a more distinct opposition between the forces of rationalization and modern subjectivity (and the framework itself is explicitly national).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f26" href="#f26-text">26. </a>Islamic calligraphy became an important source of inspiration for postwar abstract Turkish painting in the 1950s. Note, however, that Baltacioğlu had been a leading proponent of this position since the early 1930s—though in many ways, his "licentious" argument concerning the invention of surrealism by Turkish calligraphers only reinforced his marginality. On postwar abstract art, see Adnan Turani, "Post-Second World War Trends in Turkish Painting," <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Turkish Painting</span>, ed. Renda Gürsel et al.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f34" href="#f34-text">34. </a>Thanks to Carey Eckhardt for calling my attention to the absence of arms and hands in much of Baltacioğlu's diagram. I would like also to thank my other colleagues in comparative literature, English, and German at Penn State, for their responses to my lecture on this material in March, 2007. I'm also grateful to Sanja Bahun and Özge Serin, for their comments on earlier drafts of this article.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>By way of documenting this spectralizing reality, Baltacioğlu provides photographs of numerous calligraphic plates, making use of a medium unrivaled in its positive representational capacity. However,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> instead of using this technology to produce or to document identities, Baltacioğlu instrumentalizes it, hoping to record the "surreality" of the present moment, itself. Photography, which marks the material traces of its referents only to point to their disappearance, here supplements literature by indexing, in its "passings," the internal difference of writing. At the same time, in such non-mimetic transactions, the photographic medium itself is all the more linked to the "old" writing.</p></div>
