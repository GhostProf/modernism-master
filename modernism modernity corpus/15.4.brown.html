<h1 class="sec-headA">Under Cellophane Skies</h1>
<p>As the curtains opened on the avant-garde opera event of 1934, Virgil Thompson and Gertrude Stein's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>, the audience faced a vast sign of the production's cutting edge modernity: 1500 square feet of sky-blue cellophane was draped from the sides and ceiling of the stage, creating a semi-transparent cyclorama, glittering under bright white lights. The stark artificiality of the stage design proclaimed its relationship to the modern world and its unsurpassed hold on the new: "The cellophane set, brilliantly lit to evoke a sky hung with rock crystal, defied comparison to anything the audience had ever seen."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The set and costume designer was Florine Stettheimer, a New York painter whose close friends included Marcel Duchamp and Carl Van Vechten, and whose paintings were characterized by their light-infused surfaces and whimsical approach to their subjects (her style was sometimes called "primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>"<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>). Stettheimer had never ventured into the world of stage or costume design before <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> (and wouldn't again), but her efforts were met with critical acclaim for her spectacular vision: "some thought that [her] costumes outdid the Ziegfeld Follies, and one quipped that the sets were 'Botticellophane.'"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Plastic, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that most twentieth-century of materials, here transformed the stage into a powerful blend of art, glamour, and the latest technology.</p>

<p>We've lost, in the intervening decades, the ability to read the early-century semiotics of plastics, and particularly of cellophane. Stettheimer's stage today, rather than looking sleek and streamlined, appears hung with the cheap plastic that wraps mattresses or other bulky household items for shipping. But what did cellophane signify? Why was it taken up not only by Stettheimer, but by the designers of lavish Hollywood musical sets and their promoters? Cellophane appears throughout popular culture in the 1920s and 1930s, generally signifying the slickly modern. Cellophane tablecloths glitter in an upscale nightclub in the Astaire-Rogers blockbuster <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span> ; cellophane also appears in an earlier Joan Crawford film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Lady</span> , in the transparent swags at the back of a dance set, and again in the Broadway musical staged within the film. Here, the cellophane appears in costume-form: a group of black-attired old women, complete with bonnets, lace collars, wire glasses, and bent-over backs make their way into a futuristic beauty parlor and emerge as modern bombshells, perfectly artificial with cellophane outfits and what might be plastic hair. Cellophane similarly appears in a swanky Chinese nightclub as the "The Girls in Cellophane" take the stage in W.C. Fields' <span style="font-style:italic;">International House</span> . Cellophane was chic and, above all, <span style="font-style:italic;">now</span>.</p>
<p>How could this plastic sheeting have connoted glamour for 1930s audiences? From its first American appearance in 1931 as the revolutionary new moisture-proof wrapper of Camel cigarettes, cellophane was an undisputed success, standing out "as the lone spot of brilliance in the otherwise dismal commercial landscape of the Depression."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Cellophane served as a cultural reference with greater significance than the mere freshness of cigarettes: it inspired a new packaging aesthetic as well as an intensified relationship of desire between consumer and product. And the aesthetic clearly went beyond the mundane glamour of such luxuries as tobacco products. Cellophane proved <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to be a cultural force: besides appearing on the avant-garde stage, the MGM musical set, and as a backdrop to celebrity photographs, it evoked commentary of one sort or another in the pages of magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune, Esquire</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Yorker</span>. Even Cole Porter equaled it to Spanish nights, great art, and Garbo's salary in his 1934 hit "You're the Top" ("You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain / You're the National Gallery / You're Garbo's salary / You're cellophane!"). Cellophane was linked with glamour in its earliest marketing; one of its first advertisements announced "glamorous new transparent cellulose sheeting." Somehow, this tag line fails to convince, but historian Stephen Fenichell writes that "cellophane was defining itself as a carriage-trade product, a shimmering jewel in sheet form, the epitome of elegance and glamour in the new commercial art form called packaging."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> And customers were buying.</p>
<p>The development of plastic coincided with the Machine Age interest in streamlined design, clean lines, and the spareness that characterized modern buildings, furniture, industrial design, and so on. The prevailing design aesthetic of the early 1930s was "low, horizontal, sculptural, flowing, [and] evocative of speed"; the "streamlined design reflected the desire for frictionless flight into a utopian future whose rounded vehicles, machines and architecture would provide a visually uncomplicated protective environment . . . closed off from the Depression and marked by static perfection."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Plastics seemed to offer a thoroughly modern medium with the magical power of transmuting and perfecting form. Paul Frankl, one of a group of self-proclaimed "industrial designers" and author of several books based on the principles of Machine Age design, exclaimed: "The new alchemy! The very name invented by twentieth-century necromancers rivals those mystical elixirs of the Middle Ages! Cellophane, pyroxolia, karolyth, aladdinite, pyrolin, amerith, durez!. . . .They are truly the founders of a new language of industrial design."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The language of synthetic chemistry—the plastics that inspired the designer's imagination—borrows its vocabulary from shape-shifting, magic, and the plasticity of language itself in a mélange that connotes glamour.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Frankl exhorted the public to employ this "new idiom," this "new alphabet" in order to learn its "unprecedented syntax."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Plastics, or "materia nova," provided a modern vernacular that could speak directly to the twentieth century and its miraculously transforming technologies. In speaking this language, one participated in its mysterious alchemy and helped to ensure its utopian results. The new plastics made one, above all, modern. American leisure, Frankl exuberantly proclaimed, must be "wrapped in cellophane!"<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Leisure, the time made available by machine labor, should be aesthetically brilliant, impervious to the elements, artificial in all the best senses of the word. <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune</span> magazine declared that "the synthetic plastic . . . is a glamorous substance and a tribute to the powers of man"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> and Frankl exhorted his readers to wrap themselves up in those powers, make themselves over in a shiny new substance, and celebrate the virtuosity of a transparent plastic coating.</p>
<p>I'm interested in cellophane as pure surface, as the plastic without depth that provides the transparent gloss and promises to perfect one's leisure, at least aesthetically. The paper-thin, impermeable layer of cellulose sheeting offered the modern imagination new ways of seeing the mundane world: the glassy sheen of cellophane provided a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  protective veneer from dusty reality and, like lightweight and mobile glass, cellophane could wrap anything and thus transform it into a sparkling play of light. Cellophane arrests the gaze at its glittering surface, becomes a version of the photograph, emptied of content or form. This would be a photograph without any representative function, but rather a blank surface that is endlessly appealing, seductive, though it transmits little beyond the wonder of its alchemy. Perhaps it was this blankness that Stettheimer wished to exploit as she planned her cellophane sky and the cellophane robes that some of the actors would wear. Reviewer Joseph Wood Krutch corroborates the empty effects of Stettheimer's cellophane set, claiming that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> is a success because all its elements—the dialogue, the music, the pantomime, and the sparkling cellophane décor—go so well with one another while remaining totally irrelevant to life, logic, or common sense. . . . One will find [like <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>] . . . the tendency toward form without content and toward a kind of intelligibility without meaning characteristic of surrealism and the Dadaists."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The comment is directed toward the combined effects of the opera's elements, but it certainly speaks to the function of cellophane on the stage itself. Empty of anything but the barest form, the draped cellulose film is irrelevant to life or logic, and offers nothing in the way of meaning. The empty effect was emphasized by the bright white lights that Stettheimer insisted should illuminate the gathered cellophane and made it shine like some artificial and other-worldly sky. Krutch deftly makes the link, then, between the work of cellophane and the more lofty literary modernism that emerged in the preceding decade. As pure form, or form without content, cellophane stands in, at least superficially, for some modernist formal ideals. Crisp, smooth, clear, hygienic, even icy in appearance, cellophane was a wonder wrapping and metaphor for language re-made, removed of all its "words worn thin."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> While Stein had nothing to do with the concept behind the set design, the cellophane seemed to suit, perfectly, her approach to writing.</p>
<p>For Stein, neither memory nor representation had any place in writing; instead her writing would gather its force from vibrant word juxtapositions in the flattened moment of what she termed the "continuous present."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Flatness was a consistent aesthetic priority for Stein, from the time she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> in 1913 to her lectures presented on her return trip to the U.S. in 1934, just following the opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>. In one of these lectures, "Plays," she refers to <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> as a sort of unmoving landscape: "A landscape does not move nothing really moves in a landscape but things are there, and I put into the play the things that were there." She continues: "Magpies are in the landscape that is they are in the sky of a landscape . . . they hold themselves up and down and look flat against the sky."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> The reader, or audience member, would be invited, then, into this flattened landscape, to experience a single plane or flattened moment rather than the progressive diachronic demands of typical dramatic narrative. Stein asserts, again in keeping with the formal innovation and transparent surface of cellophane: "After all, my thought is a complicated simplicity. I like a thing simple, but it must be simple through complication."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Cellophane offers one version of this complicated simplicity, its empty surface reflecting a complex synthetic chemistry and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  an experimental history that spanned decades. Formal experiment defines more generally the early decades of twentieth-century literature, and certainly no re looms larger than Gertrude Stein's.</p>
<p>The production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fours Saints in Three Acts</span> thus offers a unique opportunity to consider the relationship between modernism and the new synthetic materials of the twentieth century. One might even think of cellophane as the objective (and material) correlative to many of the aims of modernism: as an almost substance-less substance, it resonates with Stein's project to drain the signifier of its signification; it harnesses a new generation to consider the impact of the surface through an attention to form (rather than a singular focus on content); it also speaks to an increasing concern with hygiene, both in the realms of public health (preventing the contamination of food) and aesthetics (encouraging the "clean" line, shorn of all superfluous words).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Cellophane, then, as a sign of the new, offered modernists a material with all the plasticity and possibility of language; Stettheimer's set design and Stein's text together spoke in the century's new vernacular, insistently contemporary, to an audience delighted to hear the message.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Plastic and "Limitless Control"</h1>
<p>In order to understand the excitement generated by Stettheimer's set, it helps to understand something of the drama that produced it. Cellophane is, of course, first and foremost a consumer item whose role has been largely played out <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> in the world of design, literature, or avant-garde opera, but in the manufacturing sector and marketing campaigns of such companies as Camel, Lucky Strike, Coty perfumes, and Whitman's chocolates. Its history begins in 1904 when a Swiss chemist worked to invent a waterproof tablecloth. This particular venture failed, but in the process Dr. Jacques Brandenberger created a method of producing transparent sheets of viscose film. He would form a company in 1913 called "La cellophane" (a combination of the Greek <span style="font-style:italic;">kellon</span> for "wood" and <span style="font-style:italic;">phaino</span>, or "to be seen")<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> with the goal of producing a new film stock, an alternative to the highly flammable cellulose nitrate. Again, this venture would fail (the film wasn't, after all, impervious to heat), but Brandenberger would continue to develop his synthetic film as a wrapping material, first selling it as an expensive luxury wrapper to Coty perfumes in the early 1920s. The company began production in the U.S. in 1924 and became a familiar household product with the break-through development of the "humidor pack" for cigarettes in 1930.</p>
<p>The development of cellophane occurs against the broader backdrop of a rapidly expanding plastics industry. Plastics were nothing if not diverse—they ranged from thermo-setting plastics (phenolic resins, cast phenolic, urea resins), thermoplastics (cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, acrylic resins, polystyrene), and protein plastics (made from casein)—and included such revolutionary materials as celluloid, Bakelite, nylon, and cellophane. Plastics offered industrial designers a new material with unlimited opportunities unhampered by the various challenges of designing in wood, metal, or glass as one enthusiastic commentator on the development of plastics writes: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "From all these limitations, imposed by the nature of materials, the designer is now free. Plastics have given him a new and almost unbelievable liberty for experiment and expression."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Now a "limitless control of material"<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> defined the designer's idiom and created a utopia of infinite design potential. The idea of infinity bedazzled the growing numbers of modernist designers, whose art would no longer be made to suffer the tyrannical control of natural materials. The "materia nova" offered unfettered access to the creative imagination without the limits imposed by the bends and warps of wood, its narrow range of color, or its limited availability as a natural resource; in this way, plastic was the most impersonal of materials, unmarred by any idiosyncracy, even untouched by human hands. It epitomized another kind of modernist ideal, then, in its cool, aloof distance from the subjective world of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, plastics production incorporated modernist design principles, although the history of plastics long predates modernism. The earliest patent of a plastic material was granted in 1855; celluloid proved to be an excellent material for fabricating billiard balls, piano keys, and various other items to resemble ivory, bone, horn, marble, or tortoiseshell. This penchant for imitation aligned celluloid with a distinctly Victorian aesthetic; not only could the nitrocellulose material be formed into highly ornamented household objects that previously only the wealthiest could afford, but its disguise pre-empted any anxiety around the newness and radical innovation of the product.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Plastics, in the guise of age-old natural products, threatened no one and thus conservative public tastes would not bar its financial success. It wasn't until the 1920s, writes Jeffrey Meikle, that the "modernist disdain for imitation as dishonest and immoral"<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> influenced the way that celluloid was produced and promoted. Those household objects such as brushes and combs were now characterized for consumers as "so radically different, so smart and so modern"<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> and did not hide the fact of their industrial production. Instead they were streamlined, designed according to function rather than according to what modernists perceived as the fussy standards of nineteenth-century ornamentation. The aesthetic of spareness (what Ezra Pound made into a kind of poetic hygiene in his principles of imagism)<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> becomes visible a decade later then on the toilet table and in the pantry.</p>
<p>Celluloid would soon lose ground to the multiple new kinds of plastics that were emerging. Meikle writes that "celebration of an approaching 'plastic age' reflected the euphoria of the industry's executives in the 1920s and 1930s. In a few short years they had witnessed their field's expansion beyond the limited materials and methods of celluloid."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> A 1929 plastics directory, he continues, lists 84 trade names; in 1933 that number doubles, and more than triples by 1939. The amazing growth in the patenting and manufacture of plastics provided a new alphabet, indeed, for those interested in creating a new aesthetic, which would become particularly relevant for a culture making the transition from the economic boom-times of the 1920s to the tightly constrained financial climate of the 1930s. Plastics offered radically democratized access to the products of cutting-edge design: with improved manufacturing processes, plastics could be affordable for a great section of the population who wanted to share in, or speak with, this new and luxurious vernacular. Elite design and middle class incomes coincided for perhaps the first time as the Plastic Age was ushered excitedly in. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Glamour continued to be linked with plastics, both in the world of elite design and in the more everyday world of consumer goods. A 1940 issue of the trade magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span>, for example, makes this connection in an article entitled "Vending Machine Glamour." Plastic pulls the "silent salesman" (that is, the vending machine) out of awkward adolescence and into a mature and sexy adulthood: "To the vending machine industry the plastics have given the color and brightness which is helping to transform its products from the awkward appearance of yesterday into the <span style="font-style:italic;">glamour boys</span> of today and tomorrow" (italics in original).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The article declares the incipient manifest destiny of this industrial marvel:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In the ingenious and sometimes spectacular applications of plastics to more and more diversified groups of products and uses, each invasion into a new industry constitutes a chapter of singular importance. Frequently, in fact, an entire industry may gravitate in their direction and the plastics find themselves established in a new field almost overnight. That such annexation of new territory sometimes occurs in exposed and unexpected fields only makes the advance more colorful and interesting.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>As the language indicates, plastics were sweeping the landscape, conquering new and unexpected lands in a mission to liberate and beautify. The colonizing metaphor isn't, in retrospect, so far-fetched: the "freedom" and "limitless control" celebrated by Frankl reappear here in the gleeful tone of an industry recognizing the potential for limitless expansion and therefore limitless profit. The partnership of glamour and the colonial impulse, like that of glamour and the primitive, becomes a recognizable trope in the 1930s. Just as the age of colonial empire was coming to a close, an age of global industrial expansion was opening up. A universe of commercial possibilities came with it, including at times—despite Frankl's excitement about a new vernacular—a borrowed vocabulary from the more tarnished language of empire (though polished up for its new medium). <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span> recognized the industry's bright future with its "glamour boys" advancing on the front lines, poised to bring home the sale.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Race for Plastics</h1>
<p>Enter into this climate of euphoric executives, ecstatic designers, and an emergent consuming public, the collaborative Thompson-Stein (and I will add -Stettheimer) venture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>. Exploiting the vogue for everything African, Thompson had decided to use an all African-American cast for the production, claiming (somewhat disingenuously) that the superior diction of African Americans made them the best choice for the difficult language of Stein's libretto: "They alone possess the dignity and the poise, the lack of self-consciousness that proper interpretation of the opera demands. They have the rich, resonant voices essential to the singing of my music and the clear enunciation required to deliver Gertrude's text."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Van Vechten, surprisingly, given his penchant for all things Negro (he was, after all, situated at the center of the Harlem Renaissance as patron, cheerleader, photographer, and a writer of some infamy <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  after the publication of his novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>)<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> disapproved of Thompson's choice, believing that Stein's text had nothing to do with African Americans. Stettheimer also expressed her apprehension on aesthetic grounds, worrying that the "varied brown skin tones would sully the brilliant colors of her costumes"; she consequently (and apparently seriously) "proposed painting the cast white or silver."<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The artist, whose aesthetic interests ranged from extravagant Victorian landscapes of lace to the more austere modernity of cellophane (her own apartment was decorated in draping lace and cellophane), would incorporate both materials, creating formal costumes against the wondrous vacancy of the surrounding cellophane skies.</p>
<p>When Stein herself heard of the plan to costume the black actors in cellophane, she also expressed grave doubts about maintaining the integrity of her text: "I suppose they have good reasons for using negro singers instead of white, there are certain obvious ones, but I do not care for the idea of showing the negro bodies, it is too much what the English in what they call 'modernistic' novels call futuristic and do not accord with the words and music to my mind."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Stein apparently worried about the clash between the false futurity of the falsely modern, and her own truly modern prose of the "continuous present," a prose that had brought literature, she claimed, into the twentieth century. She made this claim about the appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, its central story "Melanctha," of course, exploiting the fascination with African masks and African American stereotypes (the story explicitly circles around Melanctha's insatiable desire as she learns to gather "wisdom" or sexual knowledge). Stein was certainly invested in representations of race—as many critical works on her explore—but in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, she claimed, her interest was elsewhere.</p>
<p>Carl Van Vechten's assertion that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> had nothing to do with African Americans seems reasonable. The opera focuses on two sixteenth-century Spanish saints, Ignatius and Therese, and is, like much of Stein's work, difficult to paraphrase neatly. The four saints of the title number more like twenty, and there are four or even five acts, rather than the promised three. The word "negro" appears twice within the text, though the use is arguably glancing: "Saint Therese. Could a negro be with a beard to see and to be. / Saint Therese. Never have to have seen a negro there and with it so."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Stein distinguishes seeing and being, producing categories of difference, and opposing ontology to superficial appearance. The "negro," with visible beard, is <span style="font-style:italic;">there</span> to see, embodied and ontologically unquestionable, despite the question form of the line itself. Eight lines later the scene ends with "Saint Therese come again to be absent." While the negro emphatically, or at least doubly, is said to "be," Therese herself comes again (in the voice of the continuous present), reappears, but only in her absence, de-realized in the visual realization of the negro. The embodiedness of the "negro," in these lines, is counterpoised to the absent body of the saint (who is paradoxically there and not there). In this sense, one sees that "being" is bestowed upon the African American (who is not absent) here; Stein uses the idea–that is, borrows the popular stereotype—that the African American is all body, closer to nature, and thus becomes the re for embodiment altogether (as she had when she created the character of Melanctha). The body of culture, on the other hand, is represented by the saint who <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is present only in her absence, in the luminosity of her halo, and who occupies the space of idea rather than any sort of solid physicality. Thompson may have reflected on these lines as he made his casting decision, but it seems more likely that he was working within a milieu that appreciated the avant-garde implications of using a cast of African-American opera singers; he was also banking on the guaranteed notoriety this would bring to the production (<span style="font-style:italic;">Porgy and Bess</span>, George Gershwin's opera featuring an African-American cast, would premiere the following year, in 1935).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that it was the prurience, if not the notoriety (she seemed comfortable with this) of showing bodies beneath cellophane that concerned Stein in the Stettheimer design, although these robes would, in the end, be worn over richly ornamented costumes (even the hands of the cast would be chastely covered with white gloves, combining two popular images of African Americans as minstrels and devout churchgoers). According to Steven Watson, "Only in the opera's 'sniplets,' as choreographer Frederick Ashton dubbed the two fleshly <span style="font-style:italic;">divertissements</span>, did the dancers reveal flesh. One of these, a dance in the second act about six angels learning to fly, featured women with bare midriffs, the shortest of skirts, and bare-chested, bare-legged men."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Watson adds a comment on the overall effect of the casting and set design: "At just the right moment, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> offered a casting revolution, daring and inevitable, at once libidinous and prim, wrapped up in a gauzy candy box of a setting." This, the aesthetic of primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>, best characterized the opera's overall look: if there was a race for plastic, it was the African race, and in that juxtaposition the production achieved a winning effect, at least as far as the artistically minded of 1934 were concerned. The black body, at least for avant-garde audiences, signified some proximity to nature and the <span style="font-style:italic;">feeling</span> that modern culture (that is "civilization") denied its subjects. The cellophane stage, then, represented a sort of reality principle: its cold swags, reflecting the bare bright lights, produced a riveting and modern blankness. The cast members, in all the ontological <span style="font-style:italic;">presence</span> accorded the African American, appeared in relief against the modern and deeply compelling absence of the set (and against the disembodied <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> of the "civilized" and thus white modern subject who didn't appear at all on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage). The modern script that accepted the civilized/primitive binary held true, then, even on the avant-garde stage. Modernity, represented by the manufactured plastic sky, is here aligned with death or stasis, in contradistinction to the life force of the African-American cast on stage.</p>
<p>Here we see glamour as both depending upon and rejecting the other, recognizing difference as the thrill of transgression. Glamour, emerging from the new technologies signified by the appearance of plastic, the sexual availability that glamour promises and withdraws, and the implicit exclusions on which it is based, is thus founded on a paradox. The racial dividing line on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage marked a distinction between life—represented in the casting decision—and death, here associated with civilization and its industrial production. Cellophane, invented in an exhilarated rush of entrepreneurial energy and embraced by a generation of artists who recognized in it the sign of the new, works in conjunction, then, with death. If, as Freud succinctly claimed in 1920 when he introduced his theory of the death drive, "the aim of all life <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is death," the mass of cellophane hanging over the stage was a harbinger of that in evitable return to an earlier state of matter<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a>. Death was thus inscribed on the stage, presented against the vitality of the opera's performers, singing against the chasm, or the void that defines human life.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Regarding Nothing</h1>
<p>While blankness, absence, and transparency are not unique to the text and staging of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, they produced a particularly timely demonstration of its impact on the modern stage and on the modern subject. Absence, and its suggestion of a greater Nothing, appears repeatedly in the literature of the period as a defining trope of the modern. Modernist literature often swirls around a central and structuring abyss: one thinks of the meaning-collapsing darkness of the Marabar Caves in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage to India</span>, Caddy's painful absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sound and the Fury</span>, the circular wandering and central lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sun Also Rises</span>, the missing main character of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, or the terrifying Nothing that characterizes the work of Beckett and Kafka. This structural emptiness reflects the anxiety of a world no longer able to rely on reason, a world in which, as Heidegger characterizes it, "we hover in anxiety"<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> against a defining Nothing. Nothing is the formless void, yet even "void" suggests its status as object. It is without form, without status in our world of nouns. "Nothing" may be interpreted in numerous registers, from the psychoanalytic (one thinks of Lacan's Thing, that zone around which desire endlessly circles, the vortex or vacuole linked to the failure of language and representation, the space that stands for all we have lost in the transition from infancy), to the existential, to the metaphysical and theological. Even a generation after Nietzsche, the modernist age continued to be characterized by the <span style="font-style:italic;">nihil</span> and the death of god. In god's place, as Marxist theory argues, was the growing fetishization of the commodity: plastic, produced in the magic of synthetic chemistry and met with the public's perpetual wonder, takes up its place as fetish, then, despite the blankness of its surface.</p>
<p>But blankness isn't, after all, identical to nothing. Blankness, particularly the blankness of cellophane, merely comes to represent the nothing through the emptiness of its surface. It isn't nothing, but signifies, or better gestures toward, the nothing that generates so much anxious modernism (Eliot's paradigmatic line, "I can connect / Nothing with nothing" comes to mind<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a>). Rather than ask cellophane to bear the weight of these significant philosophical enquiries into the nothing, I simply want to invoke its power on Stettheimer's stage as metaphoric, as speaking through its shallow and shiny surface to a culture quietly hovering in the anxiety of historical change, a questionable hold on reason, and dizzying technological development. This affective response, one might note, echoes the effect of the sublime, characterized by the bewildered response to something incomprehensibly vast, outside the individual's powers of reason to contain it. Blankness, without the delimiting detail, presented the vastness of scope that the sublime generally indicates. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In his work on the sublime, artist and art critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe points out the growing use of blankness as a signifier in the early twentieth century:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The passage from the Victorians to modernism and beyond is one which leads from a <span style="font-style:italic;">horror vacui</span> to a displayed blankness. . . . transparency was also close to the idea of the instantaneous, whereas detail is a matter of duration, and this is the sense in which the kind of modernism grounded in an absolute substitution of transparency for detail and plenitude may be seen as a transitional period between what it despised and what takes it for granted. Before modernism, accumulation and detail, after it, blankness.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that transparency, here synonymous with blankness (a point to which I will return below), becomes a wider cultural ideal and signifier for all that is modern. Transparency provides a new way into time itself, which was being newly and constantly theorized during the modernist era. "Duration," in Gilbert-Rolfe's usage, is not to be confused with the Bergsonian "durée" which describes the experience of time as outside of chronology, overlaying past, present, and future in a single and simultaneous moment. The "modernist moment," the arresting of an instant in the rush of the crowded events of historical time, provided a way to open up and understand experiential time outside the tyranny of chronology. Like the instantaneous, Stein's continuous present and James Joyce's "fluid succession of presents" (a concept much like Stein's notion and produced at roughly the same time) bespeak an intimate relationship to the modernist experimentation with and theorization of the "fourth dimension."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Captured in the transparent skies of Stettheimer's set was a vision into a complexly realized and dramatically flattened time. Her billowing sky, then, suggests this multiply constituted nothing, the window that offers no information except the glean of its own blankly transparent surface.</p>
<p>Transparency and blankness, although apparently analogous, in fact operate in different registers. Transparency relies on the logic of consumer desire: the clean, see-through material that appeared to consumers in the early 1930s offered both an unimpeded view of the product and an additional sheen that improved its appearance; its smooth, glossy surface created a relationship of desire, acting as tantalizingly flimsy barrier, between consumer and good. Transparency thus encouraged consumption through a series of promises, from the cleanliness and good health of the product to the style and modernity of its package.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Blankness, however, works on a much vaster scale and doesn't engage the desires produced by consumer goods; rather, blankness points to absence, and to the terrifying and exhilarating void that eighteenth-century theorists elaborated in their works on the sublime. Gilbert-Rolfe is most interested in charting the shifting significations of blankness through the Victorian period up to the contemporary moment. He writes: "Where [blankness] once marked the absence of the sign by being a sign for absence, it is now the sign of an invisible and ubiquitous technological presence."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> He describes the meaning of blankness at both ends of this short historical spectrum from the realm of crowded visual detail to the silent hum of the electrical (or digital) current: for the Victorians, blankness was absence, the space to be (anxiously) filled. Blankness was not a desirable condition, but one to be <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  addressed (thus the ubiquitous wallpaper of the era). In the contemporary moment (Gilbert-Rolfe is writing in the last breath of the twentieth century), blankness itself is the sign, blankness speaks, it is "eloquent" rather than silent. Blankness today, he argues, finds expression in excess (an excess linked to the electronic and digital age) rather than absence.</p>
<p>Modernism is importantly situated between these two understandings of blankness. Gilbert-Rolfe uses the modern period in its transitional importance, as a moment of shedding the earlier demand for detail and an increasing desire for the blank surface. Yet the point shouldn't be skimmed over lightly: hardly a passive transitional period, modernism defiantly took up the empty, the blank, or the transparent, projecting it as a historical condition and aesthetic ideal. Particularly fascinating is how in the modern period, blankness was <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the absence of any variety of things—spanning a vast categorical range from ornament to metaphysical values—<span style="font-style:italic;">and also</span>, in the re of cellophane, the sign of a newly ubiquitous, or a swiftly becoming ubiquitous, technological presence. It is the both/and that fascinates me here—how blankness during the modern period signified absence (in the form of things lost or cast off) <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> presence in the form of the overwhelming recognition of technological power. Gilbert-Rolfe refers to the pervasive techno-presence associated with the age of computer technology; cellophane, rather, and particularly on Stettheimer's stage (and also on the Hollywood set as I will discuss below), suggests the overarching, all-encompassing presence of the technologies born out of synthetic chemistry—these audiences could have no idea just how thoroughly plastic would permeate their lives, even eventually their bodies—via its consumer-driven products. Nevertheless, its blank surface, shimmering innocently (that is, as if to bear no message) in the bright lights, one might experience the vastness of its import, a recognition of the exponentially increasing power of technology over the puny human subject, and in this sense a sublime in which, as Gilbert-Rolfe argues, the infinite nature of technology replaces the formerly infinite nature of nature itself.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, nature is outdone by the velocity of technological development as Walter Benjamin has famously noted;<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> caught up in the tremendous surge of its power, the modern subject experiences a newly revised sublime. The power, one should remember, comes from chemistry, the science that shares in the magic of alchemy and shape-shifting. With the recognition that the physical universe was alterable through the new capacity to change its physical properties, anything seemed possible. The force of this revolutionary technology overtakes and carries along everything in its path—nature will not look the same again, once the industrial world has allied itself with sweeping technological change, and a new era of mass production has begun. This is more visible to us now, having the whole of the century to observe at once, but in the 1930s, technological potential was thrilling (as was the idea of conquering nature), though mixed with the anxiety that accompanies any such sweeping change and encounter with "magic."</p>
<p>Art deco design worked to maximize the tension between the blank quiet of smooth lines and white surfaces and the impending explosion of the technologized world. Van Nest Polglase, the designer behind the beautifully stark sets of the Astaire-Rogers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  films, developed "the fixed architectural institution that soon became known as the B.W.S. (Big White Set)."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The signature look was one of white on white to emphasize the smooth harmony and open space of the set: "Bodies, or rather costumes, which also formed an essential part of this environment, had to be streamlined even when standing still" which added to the "total, smooth environment" of the set.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gloss was a premium feature of the design, and Polglase employed plastics (particularly Bakelite) to produce gleaming dance floors. The result was a calmly static set, although Polglase also exploited the effect of circles against angles to "suggest the springs and spokes of a machine, or, more abstractly, the contrast between movement and stillness."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Polglase featured cellophane in the 1936 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span>, as I mentioned earlier, creating a set that was clearly artificial (even ironically so with the cellophane-clad glamour girls) and streamlined to heighten the effect of the dancers. Technology was quietly visible on stage, although the expanses of cellophane suggested calm stasis over the noise associated with industry. This was Hollywood magic at its purest, combining the beautifully engineered with the veneer of impenetrable beauty.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the greatest displays of Hollywood alchemy, and one that explicitly linked technology with the infinite, was the extravagant 6500 square foot set constructed for the final dance sequence of the Fred Astaire/Eleanor Powell musical, <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody of 1940</span>. This was the largest set ever constructed for a dance sequence and gathered all the forces of Hollywood technical wizardry. Ann Miller recalls its massive mirrored glass floor and "midnight blue cyclorama wired with 10,000 light bulbs for stars."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Thirty-foot mirrors multiplied the set's effect as they reflected the light, the dancers, and produced an effect of infinite depth. A giant curtain of thinly sliced cellophane hung toward the back of the set, and through it the seemingly innumerable stars shone. Twenty-five foot palm trees, also constructed from sliced cellophane, completed the effect of a desert oasis, their cellophane fronds hanging sleekly over the whole set. The Merrill Pye art deco design emphasized the seemingly infinite space, the palm trees and stars visible on every surface, producing an effect that was "clean," "slick," and entirely comprised of "shimmering surfaces."</p>
<p>The final extended dance sequence begins as a woman in sarong and head-wrap sings Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine" in a sultry style of music appropriate to the tropical setting. The actress here is Carmen D'Antonio, though the singing is dubbed (the vocals are by Lois Hodnett). D'Antonio's filmography indicates that she worked, for the most part, as a secondary player, cast as a dancer and "harem girl," "native girl," servant to Salome, the "treasure of Kalifa," and an "Oriental dream" (she even once played the Puerto Rican love interest of Uncle Bill on the 1960s television series "Family Affair"). She offered Hollywood a pretty and generic otherness that could authenticate its fantasies of Singapore, Arabia, or Morocco. In this Astaire/Powell vehicle, D'Antonio provides an exotic and old-world counterpoint to the sleek Plastic Age features of the set. A chorus of women appears like a dreamy harem in beautifully flowing costumes, their mid-riffs bare as they sway to the sensual music. A gauzy curtain parts to reveal the cellophane trees and behind them, the shimmering cellophane swag. This gigantic MGM set is designed to produce the utmost effect of glamour, with its infinite reflections, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  its glassy surfaces, and the exotic dancers who, like Thompson's African-American cast, provide a shorthand sign for authenticity, a measure of the distance modern culture has come, and an expression of the modern desire to preserve the vision of a simpler and more sensual life (the women, swaying in unison and singing softly suggest beautiful field laborers, picturesque in their servitude). The visual spectacle, resulting from the combination of cellophane and this picture of "ethnic authenticity" literalizes the movement of the sublime from the awesome power of nature to the cool distance of glamour. The physical embodiment, or the weightiness of the authentic or natural is displaced, replaced by the physical transparency, the sleekness of the manufactured product.</p>

<p>The Carmen D'Antonio character quietly disappears as the real star, Eleanor Powell, rises before the cellophane curtain, her white costume a variation on a belly-dancer's seductive garb, but made for the athlete's body, as Powell's movement quickly demonstrates. The set gives a sense of infinite depth: Powell's re is reflected in the mirrors, she dances on the shimmery image of palm fronds, there are lights shining everywhere. Fred Astaire appears and together their feet tap in swift and complicated harmony, the exoticism of the piece undiminished in its passionate choreography. Considered "the greatest tap duet ever filmed," this choreography does not fail to awe in its technical mastery and dazzling design: the sound alone is stunning, the deftness of their tapping feet imperceptible to the eye; this is the body made machine. One might say that here is the sublime, re-realized for an eager movie-going public: the infinite sound, the depthless lights, the reference to otherness, the glassy impenetrability of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the set produce an echo of the sublime in its glamour, bolstered by the explicit use of streamlined technology.</p>
<p>But before the audience can quite make out the complex desire initiated by this sequence, it comes to a close as the couple dances off-stage, and soon reappears, re-costumed for the next segment in all-American clothes. Powell is in a ruffled knee-length day-dress, Astaire has shed his toreador costume for a comfortable suit, and the music has shifted to a more recognizably American swing-tempo. They are the picture of go-to Americans, engaged in friendly competition on the dance floor. It's good clean fun as goofy smiles replace the serious expressions and erotic overtones of the preceding segment, and the cellophane set recedes from view, as each dancer shows, again, a staggering—and this time individual—tap virtuosity. Finally, in a flurry of spins they dance off-stage, are reunited with a friend (played by George Murphy), and the three return to the stage, the image of happy, wholesome, American friends.</p>
<p>In the background, significantly, remains the chorus of women in their Easternized costumes, immobile and statuesque against the cellophane curtain. Here we see the image of American vitality against the beautiful static glamour of the background, and here the film ends. While one may argue that cellophane has played the smallest of roles here, offering some style in the form of a shiny accent, I would argue, rather, that it stands for the beckoning emptiness of the modern age, the transparent reminder of the absence at the heart of, or especially at the heart of, the most innocent American pleasures. The cellophane curtain and palm fronds, hanging like icicles, offer the cold artifice of glamour, a stillness in the background that arrests the eye, despite the athleticism and hard-working effort of the film's tap-dancing stars.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Nudity and High Buildings, or, Cellophane Rising</h1>

<p>The giddy use of the new plastics and particularly of the candy-wrapping cellophane had, though, its detractors. <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> published a satirical image called "The Cellophane Gown" by Gilbert Seehausen in 1933 [<a name="5-text" href="#5">re 5</a>], the first year of the magazine's publication. The 1933 Chicago World's Fair (branded as "The Century of Progress") was the instigator of the image, as the above caption makes clear. In the image, a shapely model smiles as she poses in high heels wearing an extravagant and entirely transparent cellophane gown. Richly gathered folds of cellophane fall behind her, a ruffle of cellophane fans about her shoulders, and what looks to be a cellophane tiara tell us that this outfit is a version of the modern ball-gown: she is a fairy queen, though an immodest one. On closer inspection, one notices some complicating details: the gown's full skirt resembles a grass skirt belted with flowers, a flower lei is draped about the woman's neck, a bra or bikini-top is visible. Is this another modern-day primitive posed against an ultra-modern setting? Behind the smiling model, an array of skyscrapers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fan away from her. She balances like a beauty queen, rising up in the metropolis in all her plastic glory: Jane of the urban jungle. The image captures the recognition that plastics are on the rise, taking the city by storm, and by seduction.</p>

<p>If cellophane connoted everything modern, it shared all the failures of the modern age, including its vulgar consumerism, its reliance on the rhetoric of "progress," and its overt commodification of sex. E. B. White, in the same year as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image appeared, wrote an impassioned pamphlet called "Alice Through the Cellophane" that bewailed the shallow commodity culture that had seemed to enwrap the public's mind and threatened society with a kind of consumer-culture asphyxiation: "The revolution began with cellophane," he complains; people are "intrigued with its new transparencies," and driven to accumulate, egged on by the empty promises of ambitious industrialists. White makes clear that "[he] should like to propose a society based on the assumption that nobody is going to buy anything, ever again."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Cellophane, for White, stands in for all that has gone awry in a society recently impoverished and nevertheless obsessed with its purchasing power: "I can imagine no more tender or healthy sight than a group of little children making the cellophane plant rewind all the little rolls of transparent wrapping material at the end of the day, like a spider eating his own rope."<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> White imagines children, presumably untouched by the corrupt influence of plastic (unlike today's children whose toys seem exclusively made of plastic) to be the disciplinary parents, making the cellophane plant rewind all its glittery, candy-like product for the good of the adults. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The glamour of the new products couldn't last. Plastics entered into a new phase of mass production during the war and a dawning recognition of the environmental costs of the explosion of cheap disposable products chilled the utopian dreams once inspired by the alchemical marvel. What had seemed the magic of its immortal qualities, now acquired new meanings as the non-degrading plastic waste claimed more and more space. The sublime delight at the universe of possibility associated with plastics production became sublime terror at the sheer magnitude of disposal. And the semiotics shifted: what once appeared new, glamorous, and a link to the modern design world, was now cheap, disposable, and a sign of impoverishment, ranging from that of the natural world to the world of culture. Of this fall from the giddy heights of early production to the backs of our cupboards and the garbage dumps, Roland Barthes remarks: "Plastic has climbed down, it is a household material. It is the first magical substance which consents to be prosaic."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Like the ageing star, cellophane could not hide its defects (its toxicity, its yellowing in time), nor maintain its glamour.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">CODA: Cellophane Futures</h1>
<p>I want to close by considering three more recent expressions of cellophane fashion in dress-form. Each tells us, in one way or another, how far we've come from the modernist aesthetic that celebrated the power of transparency, blankness, the dress as an empty sign. First, a Leonard Joseph design from 1968: one wouldn't guess this dress was made from cellophane, embellished as it is with gold and laden with sequins. The dress may be made of plastic, but it appears in masquerade, hardly announcing its industrial raw material. Cellophane is mere "idea" here: it carries the dress but holds onto none of its identifying features. Certainly there is no celebration of plastic in this richly textured gold shift. Instead the dress connotes a kind of luxurious royalty, à propos of the royal who wore it, "fashion icon" Lee Radziwill.</p>
<p>Second, a 2003 Givenchy Couture show featured a cellophane gown as elaborate as the 1933 <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image: one reviewer, clearly delighted, wrote: "[Givenchy designer Julien Macdonald] threw caution to the wind only once, when a giant gown of iridescent ruffled cellophane blew along the runway."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Yet, this gown takes up deep rich color, works with an opaque palette that resembles the rainbow of an oil-slick, and does not use, for its effects, the utopian blankness of the cellulose material. Here the vision is one of excess, a colorized plastic canvas, producing an extreme combination of vamp and vampiric, darkly threatening with lacy accents. The cellophane continues to connote deathliness, mirrored in the blank indifference of the runway model's expression, yet the Givenchy gown reaches back to a prior age, literalizing in its design the threat of plastics as a dangerous seduction.</p>
<p>Finally, a photograph from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Honolulu Star Bulletin</span>, Feb. 12, 2002, pictures a statue of Queen Kapiolani wrapped up in what could be a plastic sarong. The caption reads: "No, this isn't the latest cellophane gown from the avant-garde designers in Paris. The statue of Queen Kapiolani was wrapped up in plastic yesterday as workmen began preparations for a flower bed." Prosaic indeed: here the plastic serves only to protect <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The image echoes, in remarkable ways, the primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>—Thompson's African-American cast, the female chorus of <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody</span>, and the transparently clad model of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image—yet it tells us that plastic as image no longer has any cultural power. As the emperor to his clothes, the queen to her plastic wrap: this time, however, the nothing is simply that, serving no metaphor, no artistic movement, no galvanizing aesthetic. The Nothing, the conceptual abyss that motivated so much of the work of modernism, disappears in these more recent uses of cellophane. Modernism had attempted to respond to the gaping center with its insistently gorgeous prose, its attention to the effects of a carefully contrived surface, and its own deployment of a glamour that might transfix the reader and thus transform an age. We might remember Stein's words: "And each of us in our way are bound to express what the world in which we are living is doing."<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> In 1934, when she said this, she referred to the sweeping effects of the cinema on human subjectivity. She might also have been referring to the plastics that were coming to redefine the meaning of "continuous present."</p>

Wells's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Time Machine</span>: "Any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have length, breadth, thickness and duration . . . .There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of space, and a fourth, time.
