1. Godard's Trauerspiel of Cinema
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In recent years, several screen adaptations of Proust's <I>&Agrave;
la recherche du temps perdu</I> have been produced in defiance of the
legendary difficulty of an enterprise that discouraged earlier directors
such as Luchino Visconti and Joseph Losey.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 In 1999, Raoul Ruiz completed <I>Le temps retrouv&eacute;</I> and, in
 2000, Chantal Akerman's <I>La captive</I> enriched the growing Proustian
 filmography. Whereas Akerman successfully adapts just one section of the
 <I>Recherche</I>, Ruiz's movie more ambitiously dramatizes the entire
 last volume, thus attempting a synoptic recapitulation of the entire
 oeuvre. To make an adaptation of the <I>Recherche</I> may look like an
 act of hubris, yet, as Walter Benjamin remarks apropos of an imagined
 film production of Goethe's <I>Faust</I>, "the indestructibility of
 the highest life in all things" compels critical intelligence to regard
 the quality, rather than the principle, of a work.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Ruiz's effort shows many clever intuitions, such as its canny
usage of superimposition to represent the intricate effects of involuntary
memory, his film, in the final analysis, fails to convince. The reason
for his failure has less to do with the <I>a priori</I> impossibility of
filming the <I>Recherche</I> than with a literal-minded fidelity to his
narrative model and a concern for <I>d&eacute;cor d'&eacute;poque</I>,
concern which unfortunately conveys the impression of a Merchant-Ivory
period piece, or perhaps a minor Visconti costume drama. Moreover, the
Chilean director's insistence on a surrealist manipulation of the image
within a single frame (for example the scenes carpeted with upturned
hats or populated

<B></B>

by mutiple Marcels) rather than on the organizing work of montage
mistakenly results in an adaptation that reduces the <I>Recherche</I>--a
novel whose very title suggests an operation of some epistemological
importance--to a trivial dramaturgical puzzle. A better translation
of the novel into the cinematic idiom would aim at a more ral or
"involuntary" relation to the original, a reinterpretation through
which the very temporal ground of interpretation would reveal itself
allegorically.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Along these lines, a work that ought to be regarded as an "involuntary"
adaptation of <I>La recherche</I> is Jean-Luc Godard's <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I>. The four-hour film, released simultaneously in
France with a four-volume book interweaving text and stills, ambitiously
attempts to reconstruct twentieth-century history and the very development
of the movies through a collage of film traces. Godard worked upon this
singular enterprise over a span of ten years from 1988 to 1998, and it
at once constitutes a sort of archeology of the medium film and an act
of recalling the twentieth century.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The result is a work divided into eight segments or, as Godard puts
 it, "constellations," bearing such evocative titles as "Toutes les
 histoires," "Une histoire seule," "Seul le cin&eacute;ma," "Fatale
 beaut&eacute;," "La monnaie de l'absolu," "Une vague nouvelle," "Le
 contr&ocirc;le de l'univers," "Les signes parmi nous" (<I>ACMS</I>,
 9). The different units vary in length and bear an often inorganic
 relationship to the central idea of the film. The titles and subtitles
 reappear as if refrains in a litany.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The final work consists of a dense montage of fragmentary movie sequences
 which is punctuated by the superimposition of flashing text, color
 schemes, paintings, and readings of literary works. Playing the role
 of Virgil, Godard guides us on our meandering way through an inferno
 of images while commenting in voice-over on the past as if from beyond
 the grave.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Melancholic in tone, Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I> ought to be understood
as a highly subjective response to the increasing obsolescence of a
certain idea of cinema, call it "art cinema," the cinema of montage
and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Although computerized cinematography may
in some sense represent the future of the form, it is evident that
the digital image, as distinct from its celluloid variant, enacts a
temporality of the perpetual present tense. Indeed, in so far as the
digital image is removed from any ontological grounding or referent,
it may even be regarded as a photograph that is atemporal in nature,
without temporality. What the camera produces is no longer necessarily a
historical record, because digital techniques enable the creation of the
image ex nihilo. Although the flexibility of the new technology opens a
space for a certain type of creative experimentation, its divorce from
historical reality deprives film of its function as a mode of memory,
and hence as a framework for critical inquiry. In this light, Godard's
search for lost cinema represents a potential corrective to indiscriminate
acceptance of the status quo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Implicit throughout this search is the recognition that film has furnished
the twentieth century with new resources of memory, chief of which are the
reorganizing procedures of montage. Montage defines the peculiar manner
in which we remember movies, the mode in which consciousness incorporates
the fragmentary, involuntary, and defamiliarizing experience of time. Yet
as powerfully as Godard's m&eacute;lange of film quotes affirms the idea
of cinema as an artistic means of access to the past, it also mourns
this untimely and imperiled notion. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
thus performs an

<B></B>

especially pointed, if allegorized, reinterpretation of <I>&Agrave;
la recherche du temps perdu</I>. Speculating on the fate of a medium
that seems about to disappear before the completion of its perceived
end, Godard draws a parallel between the task of cinema and that of the
narrator at the end of Proust's opus.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Appropriately, the most daring of film editors has achieved the most
Proustian of films. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> recounts the
camera's pursuit of what the film alternately calls a "monde perdu"
and a "temps perdu."
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The very "mati&egrave;re et m&eacute;moire" of Godard's history thus
 derive from Proust's <I>Recherche</I>. If, early in his career, the
 director's bold experiments helped establish the "amnesic" style of
 the New Wave, they now permit him to rehabilitate the tatters of our
 past. In <I>Histoire(s)</I> Godard is intent on rescuing past images from
 banality and on restoring their strangeness by refusing to supply the
 narrative context from which they are taken, as Alain Bergala points out:
 "Godard systematically refuses the present of the shots he shows us. He
 recuperates these shots from the past and if he tries to resuscitate
 them, it is by trying to allow them to return in a different way,
 disconnected from the script within which they were caught."
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's approach renounces the "objective" logic of collective
history and memory in favor of the subjective contingency of Proustian
<I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>. His quest for a lost cinematic
paradise, however, is motivated by an ambition that exceeds the strictly
"autobiographical." Godard strives to express the physiognomy of the
twentieth century through its remains. In this sense, if his aesthetic
inspiration is mainly Proustian, his ideology and methodology betray a
close proximity to Benjamin's last works, <I>The Arcades Project</I> and
the "Theses on the Philosophy of History." Indeed, as I will argue, it is
by developing a cinematic language capable of encompassing the Benjaminian
antipodes of materialist critique and messianic hope that Godard
ultimately arrives at a truly Proustian relation to the past, at a model
of remembrance that is neither mechanical nor nostalgic. <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I> imagines the resurrection of history through the
recuperation of an idea of film that has been eradicated by the ascendancy
of mass entertainment, a recovery that can only be accomplished in a
Proustian spirit of receptivity to the involuntary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

2. Cinematic Proust
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If memory is the broad, manifest theme of <I>Histoire(s)</I>, Godard in
particular wants to show how cinema alters our very conception of memory,
transforming it from the faculty of willed recall into a ghostly element
of involuntary reminiscences. On this score, he demonstrates to what
extent the medium film possesses a Proustian aspect: movies return to
haunt us according to the logic of the involuntary. Indeed, he argues
cogently that our memory of film consists of the emotional shape of
certain images, not their phenomenological content.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This position dovetails neatly with a view held by the French philosopher
Deleuze. He believes that, had Proust lived longer, he would have written
in cinematic terms; but he also regards him as the proper originator of
the most complicated of film theories, that of the time-image.
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard enlarges upon Deleuze's intuition to compose a history of
cinema that enacts the rhythm of the time-image, instead of adopting a
conventionally chronological approach. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
thus pertinently reframes the question of the relationship between
Proust's novel and cinematic memory. While many critics, from Brassa&iuml;
to Mieke Bal, agree that there is a photographic logic at work in the
<I>Recherche</I>, the cinematic subtext of the novel is more rarely and
obliquely considered by readers (Deleuze and Benjamin being the only
two critics who readily come to mind).
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 As will be contended, however, the language of the novel powerfully
 deploys a range of cinematic techniques from montage to superimposition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did Proust ever go to the movies? According to his latest biographer,
William C. Carter, the answer is yes, but probably only once. The event
took place in 1908 during a stay at the hotel in Cabourg, which later
served as the model for Balbec in the novel: on the last day of his
visit he went to see a Punch-and-Judy show.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 "This was apparently Proust's first movie," Carter writes in a footnote,
 "it may also have been his last. The cinema was one of the modern
 inventions that interested him little" (<I>MP</I>, 866). According to
 the biographer, Proust presented his friend Marcel Plantevignes with a
 copy of his French translation of Ruskin's <I>The Bible of Amiens</I>
 just before the film began.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The choice of gift seems strangely apt. The gesture brings Proust's
 devotion to the art of <I>vitraux</I> exemplified in Amiens cathedral
 back to mind, and suggests his fascination--in spite of himself--with
 that twentieth-century art form that most powerfully renovates the
 optical phenomenology of stained glass. Morever, the juxtaposition of
 religious scenes characteristic of medieval, stained-glass window-making
 anticipates the modernist emphasis of art cinema on montage and
 mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. In this regard, it is interesting to recall that
 Godard has often maintained that Christianity represents a type of
 cinema, precisely on account of its obsession with the spectacularized
 image: "I invoke Christianity as the original film; it is there for every
 painter, it is something literature has not done" (<I>ACMS</I>, 77).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his book <I>The Proustian Quest</I>, Carter remarks that in the first
two decades of the twentieth century, motion pictures offered Proust
and others (for example, Mirabeau, L&eacute;ger) an ideal model for
describing the sensation of movement in the mechanized modern era.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Carter cites a section of the <I>Recherche</I> in which Proust
 arrestingly likens the passage of a group on horseback to its own
 cinematic image. The tableau is that of Odette being greeted by the
 Prince de Sagan and his team of riders who advance past her as though
 "filmed at a gallop in the blinding glare of the avenue."
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Although it is rare, as Anne Henry notes, that film so plainly exerts
 its hold over the Proustian imagination, the novelist doubtless knew
 that his ocular preoccupations were ahead of their time.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 For example, Proust persistently indulged an interest in visual
 perspectivism; such fluidity of outlook enabled him to resist the
 finality of psychological judgments upon his characters: "Nothing is
 farther away from the analysis of a character than this succession of
 points of view which defines them. Now, by the same token, nothing is
 more modern in our century of images than such an approach" (<I>TMP</I>,
 223).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even if it may be involuntary, the filmic subtext of Proust's article
"Impressions de route en automobile," published in <I>Le ro</I>
on 19 November, 1907, is nonetheless

<B></B>

unmistakable. Reworked in the <I>Recherche</I> in the famous description
of Martinville steeples, the essay details his drives with Alfred
Agostinelli to visit Gothic cathedrals in Normandy. In the novel, he
conveys the exhilaration of kinetic sensations associated with riding
in an automobile in terms of a heightened experience of perspectival
shift. In the original essay, however, his account of the continuously
mutating point of view resulting from the car ride climaxes with the
startling epiphany of a motion picture. At night in the town of Lisieux,
while straining to see or, as he adds, at least to touch the stony
foliage of the cathedral of Notre Dame, he is suddenly confronted by
the spectacle of an overtly cinematic nativity scene:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But at the very moment when I was approaching it groping blindly, a sudden
radiance inundated it; trunk by trunk, the pillars emerged from the night,
vividly detaching, in full light against a background of shadow, the
large pattern of their leaves of stone. It was my driver, the resourceful
Agostinelli, who, sending to the ancient sculptures the greeting of a
present whose light served all the better to read the lessons of the past,
directed the fires of his headlights successively over all the parts of
the portico in such measure as I wanted to see them. And when I returned
to the car I saw a group of children whom curiosity had drawn close
and who,bending toward the lights heads whose curls fluttered in that
supernatural luminousity, reconstituted here, as if projected from the
cathedral in a ray of light, the angelic ration of a nativity scene.
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The darkness and the mechanical blaze of the headlights seem to reproduce
the phenomenological conditions of a movie theater (or perhaps more
precisely a drive-in), opening up a space for the "projection" of the
improvised nativity scene. The scene is all the more dramatic for its
juxtaposition of the mythical past in the shape of the cathedral to the
new myths of modernity in the shape of the car and, we might want to add,
the cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the <I>Recherche</I>, however, motion pictures do not receive a
flattering representation. Besides the description of the team of
riders greeting Odette, we find only four other references to the
"cin&eacute;matographique," all in <I>Le temps retrouv&eacute;</I> and
all reaffirming the superiority of literary or metaphoric representation
over the cinematic.

If reality were indeed a sort of waste product of experience, more or
less identical for each one of us, since when we speak of bad weather,
a war, a taxi rank, a brightly lit restaurant, a garden full of flowers,
everybody knows what we mean, if reality were no more than this, no
doubt a sort of cinematograph film of these things would be sufficient
and the "style," the"literature" that departed from the simple data that
they provide would be superfluous and artificial. But was it true that
reality was no more than this? (
<I>ROTP</I>
, III: 925;
<I>RDTP</I>
, IV; 468.)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proust clearly means this last question to be understood rhetorically,
since he had already observed in a preceding passage that "nothing
is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that
the cinematograph presents" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 917; <I>RDTP</I>, IV:
461). In such passages, Proust shows little awareness that the impact
of film resides not in the ability of the camera to capture images,
but in the potential of montage to incorporate time.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, Proust firmly defines the novel as a whole as the
"optical instrument" with which the writer furnishes the reader to refine
his or her perception of the world (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 949; <I>RDTP</I>,
IV: 489-90). If we surmise that the model for this optical instrument
may be film, we do so not simply because, ever since his childhood in
Combray, the narrator has been beguiled by the mysterious "magic lantern"
that projects the endlessly mesmerizing story of Golo and Genevi&egrave;ve
de Brabante.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As Anne Henry has noted, we arrive at this intuition, because the
 narrative mechanism that organizes the <I>Recherche</I> is nothing other
 than montage. Rather than a serial succession of events such as can
 be found in the more linear plots of Balzac and Zola, we encounter in
 Proust's <I>chef d'oeuvre</I> a circuitous conjunction of heterogeneous
 moments and concerns. The discrete events comprising the <I>Recherche</I>
 unfold according to a variety of different perspectives and narrative
 detours which achieve synthesis only by means of the work of montage:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Proust is therefore driven to inaugurate this modern technique: montage,
that is to say an artificial continuity obtained by adjusting sequences
built independently from one another, belonging to different domains
and yet receiving a superior unity from the general project. . . . The
strength of this kind of montage is to be found not in the effort to
produce aesthetic effects, alternation, symmetry, etc., but in the fact
that it is placed at the service of a demonstration. As one says in
cinematic language, it is an
<I>ideological</I>
montage. (
<I>TMP</I>
, 200).
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Henry's vision of a "superior unity from the general project" which
holistically emerges from the novel's independently built sequences is
consistent with Proust's revelation that he composed the <I>Recherche</I>
non-sequentially, writing the first chapter of the first volume and the
last chapter of the last volume in succession and then filling in the
intervening episodes. Regarding this authorial method we should also
recall the novel's vivid depiction of the narrator's work routine. Like
a director, the narrator Marcel constructs his manuscript through
the procedures of collage and montage by having Fran&ccedil;oise,
the domestic, cut and paste the text into a new arrangement every day
(<I>ROTP</I>, III: 1090; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 610). At the level of narrative
macroeconomics, the montage technique permits the simultaneous development
of three divergent main themes, which, following Deleuze's suggestion,
we might classify as the narrator and his social life, the narrator and
his sentimental education, and the narrator and his artistic vocation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet even at the level of its linguistic microeconomics, the
<I>Recherche</I> relies on an inherently cinematic device. The novel's
well-known predilection for metaphorical expression is not only manifested
through the mere choice of the appropriate, poetic image; rather, the
<I>Recherche</I> develops a sort of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of metaphor
through an insistence on the technique of superimposition. That is to say,
the <I>Recherche</I> aims to capture in writing how consciousness sustains
moments of optical equivocation, how the mind blends together one image
with another, a practice compounded by photographic technology. Indeed,
the experience of <I>la m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>--the novel's
philosophical nucleus--functions as a superimposition of two images,
a process that in

<B></B>

its psychological, temporal, and visual aspects ultimately achieves the
effect of film.
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 When Marcel reaches the Guermantes courtyard late in the novel and trips
 on the uneven paving stones, he is reminded of an earlier visit to Venice
 and expresses his happiness in terms of "evoked images": "A profound
 azure intoxicated my eyes, impressions of coolness, of dazzling light,
 swirled round me and in my desire to seize them . . . I continued,
 ignoring the evident amusement of the great crowd of chauffeurs, to
 stagger as I had staggered a few seconds ago, with one foot on the
 higher paving-stone and the other on the lower" (<I>ROTP</I>, III:
 899; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 445-46). Not only are these sensations
 provoked by involuntary memory described in visual terms; the moment
 of epiphany itself is presented as a sort of visual <I>ralenti</I>
 in which the narrator's image is nearly frozen as he strikes a fateful
 pose. The cinematic logic pursued by involuntary memory defamiliarizes
 the very itinerary of recollection from the slow-motion unwinding of
 the epiphany through its culminating freeze-frame of the narrator to
 the ultimate superimposition of two images--one of Venice, the other
 of the "Guermantes courtyard"--which have no organic connection to one
 another. This logic delivers a shock to the narrator precisely because
 no clear hermeneutic connection can be established between the two images
 conjoined within involuntary memory: "Owing to the work of oblivion, the
 returning memory can throw no bridge, form no connecting link between
 itself and the present minute" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 903; <I>RDTP</I>,
 IV: 449). As there is no apparent rational link between the two images,
 the operation of involuntary memory finally must be assessed in terms
 of a cinematic "superimposition."
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The critic who has been most closely attuned to Proust's cinematic
sensibility is Walter Benjamin, and it is no accident that he, in his
major essay on Proust, focuses on the central role of the image within
the <I>Recherche</I>. He observes that Proust treats the relation of
resemblance between two things according to the code of the dream world,
through the intervention of a third element: "the image."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Rather than providing a smooth synthetic integrity, the image jars the
 reader of Proust through its "beatings of wings" and "small shocks"
 ("IOP," 208).
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "The beatings of wings" aptly typifies the Proustian mise-en-sc&egrave;ne
 of superimposition, a poetic that also corresponds to the crucial
 notion of "intermittences" ("IOP," 203). Given this understanding of
 the image as the presentiment of an uncanny similarity between disparate
 things, we should not be surprised that Benjamin, in the "Theses on the
 Philosophy of History," also identifies the image as the proper means
 of access to the historical past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "Theses" conceive of history as a stream of visual "monads" that,
by virtue of their perpetual recombination, fleetingly suggest a larger
pattern of correlation. At the center of this current of fragments,
we encounter the most elusive image of all: "The true image of the past
flits by. The Past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at
the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again."
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Benjamin's definition of history in the "Theses" never strays very
 far from the language with which he discusses memory in Proust. His
 insistence that history's authentic image vanishes at the moment
 it "flashes up" bears a strong resemblance to his exposition of
 <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> in "The Image of Proust": "When the
 past is reflected in the dewy fresh

<B></B>

'instant,' a painful shock of rejuvenation pulls it together ... But this
very concentration, in which things that normally just fade and slumber
consume themselves in a flash is called rejuvenation" ("IOP," 211).
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 It seems particularly fitting to stress the latency or dormancy of the
 material expended by involuntary memory when we consider the dream-like
 suddenness with which the apparition of the narrator's dead grandmother
 in the novel is superimposed upon the empty room where Marcel is about
 to take off his boots (<I>ROTP</I>, II: 783; <I>RDTP</I>, III: 152).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, the fictive and linguistic practices of the <I>Recherche</I>
could be said to exemplify the operation of a cinematic unconscious.
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In the novel, both superimposition and montage help to establish a larger
 tropology according to which existence is defined as a function of ocular
 perception. And in consonance with this tropology, the novel presents
 the approach of death as the moment when we see the moving pictures of
 our lives unreeling before our eyes. Within a certain vein of modernist
 discourse this conceit has become familiar, crucially animating essays
 by both Benjamin and Pier Paolo Pasolini; in Proust's novel the trope
 provides the allegorical horizon within which the <I>Recherche</I>
 reveals its ideal form as a film. Benjamin's celebrated essay "The
 Storyteller" portrays the mythical moment preceding death as the occasion
 when "a sequence of images is set in motion inside a man as his life
 comes to an end," and meaning thereby becomes transmissible.
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In his article "Observations on the Sequence Shot," Pasolini argues
 that death instantaneously effects the final cut of one's life, putting
 significant moments into perspective by arranging them in sequence.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Both these writers may be viewed as performing variations on the theme
 established by Proust at the end of the <I>Recherche</I> when Marcel,
 contemplating himself on the verge of death, seems to experience the
 sudden transformation of his consciousness into a kinetic visual
 projection of his entire past. The very circular structure of the
 <I>Recherche</I> enforces the presentation of the narrative as a
 cinematic <I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I>, a print that will outlive the
 narrator.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

The trope of life as cinematic spectacle elaborates the novel's
central concept of involuntary memory, which, as Benjamin points out,
is comparable in effect to the rapid screening of an emotionally charged
or significant image. In a handwritten text found among the critic's
paperwork after his death and entitled "From a Brief Speech on Proust
on the Occasion of My Fortieth Birthday," he explicitly compares <I>la
m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> to a movie trailer or review of our death:

Concerning involuntary memory . . . one might say that a tiny image,
a photo of ourselves, is appended to our deepest moments exactly as on
certain packs of cigarettes. And that "whole life" that, as we often
hear, passes before the dying or before those people who are in danger of
dying, is composed precisely of such tiny images. They present a rapid
streaming like in those notebooks, the precursors of cinematographs,
in which, when we were children, we could admire a boxer, a swimmer,
or tennis player at his art.

According to Benjamin, then, Proust's "notebooks" are cinematic as a
consequence of the narrator's existential point of view, since it is
only his imminent death that endows the fragmentary layers of images,
the passing of involuntary memories, with that elusive

<B></B>

fluency of meaning characteristic of film. If the usual gratifications
of narrative terminus seem dubious at the end of the <I>Recherche</I>,
they are so not only because of the unlikeliness of Marcel's having a
lifetime of sufficient remaining length to write the book we have just
read. The novel seems open-ended rather because its meaning consists in
an eternal return of the same, no longer as a text but as a film. This
is to say that, in the end, the <I>Recherche</I> provides an anticipatory
glimpse of its own afterlife. The task which the narrator must shoulder,
as he recognizes, is to give birth not just to a new work of art, but
altogether to a new type of art. It is the drive to achieve not merely
the latest in the expected output of artistic products, but a change in
the very methods of production that gives <I>&Agrave; la recherche du
temps perdu</I> its radical force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To come back to Godard, what makes his <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
such a suggestive adaptation of the <I>Recherche</I> is in large part
the film's successful assimilation and refinement of a Benjaminian view
of Proust's novel.
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Godard's and Benjamin's interpretations of the novel coincide in so far
 as both privilege an understanding of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>
 in terms of an expressly visual dialectic of recollection and
 forgetfulness. However, Benjamin's work provides Godard not only
 with an aesthetics of reminiscence, but also with an ideal of the
 politically redemptive value of history. In this sense, Godard composes
 his <I>Histoire(s)</I> through a contamination of Proust's doctrine
 of involuntary memory with Benjamin's problematic of history. As the
 French director himself puts it, "the future bursts amid remembrances"
 (<I>HDC</I>, III: 12). Godard's ambiguous description of the arrival
 of the future as a violent or shocking occurrence already hints at
 the political and cultural fatalism that will frame his unveiling of a
 Proustian history of cinema. Such an attitude represents an extension
 of Benjamin's melancholy position with regard to history, capitalism,
 and the epoch of the commodity.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One essay crucial to an understanding of <I>Histoire(s) du
cin&eacute;ma</I> is Benjamin's "Theses on the Philosophy of History." In
<I>The Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin had already defined history
not as an objective science but as a form of subjective remembrance
[<I>Eingedenken</I>] (<I>AP</I>, 471). On this score, it is in Benjamin's
wake that we should position Godard's resistance to linear narrative
and preference for constellations of images.
<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 His affinity for the critic's view of history embraces not only a
 common imagistic method, but also a similar preoccupation with the
 end of time in its political and religious dimensions. Godard shares
 a belief with the later Benjamin, albeit ambivalent or "weak" in the
 philosophical sense, that history provides the messianic horizon of a
 possible resurrection of art as cinema.
<SUP><A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the image for Godard inherently carries a promise of the
 redemption of reality: "The image is first of all of the order of
 redemption, look here, that of reality" (<I>HDC</I>, III: 149). In
 the age of commodification nothing speaks to the contemporary
 <I>Zeitgeist</I> with more iconoclastic candor, nor offers greater
 hope of cultural salvation. We should not forget that, for Godard,
 Christianity represents the ideal origin of cinema, precisely because it
 constructs an allegorical iconology on the foundation of a revolutionary
 historiography. It is hardly accidental

<B></B>

that one of the epigrammatic refrains of the film, inspired by Saint
Paul, avows that "the image will return at the time of resurrection"
(<I>HDC</I>, IV: 75).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Godard as for Benjamin, the messianic horizon is linked to a "moment
of danger." Benjamin writes: "To articulate the past historically does
not mean to recognize it 'the way it really was' (Ranke); it means to
seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. . . . In
every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from
a conformism that is about to overpower it" ("TPH," 255). There is
no doubt that it is to the mindless conformism of Hollywood and the
totalizing domination of mass-market consumerism that Godard opposes
his <I>Histoire(s)</I>:

my works to show an ear that listens to time. (

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elsewhere, Godard reiterates this point when, adopting a pastiche of
H&ouml;lderlin's and Heidegger's metaphysical terminology, he imagines
the world as a realm deserted by gods where the function of the artist is
to rediscover the necessity of the sacred: "Not only have the gods and
god fled, but the splendor of divinity is extinguished in the history
of the world" (<I>HDC</I>, I: 245).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Godard and Benjamin share similar notions of memory and of history,
their respective approaches to cinema might seem at first sight very
different. Certainly, Godard would reject the German critic's initial
appraisal of cinema. In his 1936 essay "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction," Benjamin links the emergence of cinema to the
destruction of the aura of the work of art. However, Benjamin also labors
to elucidate the politically liberating consequences of the disconnection
of film from traditional culture.
<SUP><A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Yet, by the time of his 1939 article, "Some Motifs in Baudelaire,"
 Benjamin proceeds to explore the question of aura in a different frame
 of mind, complicating his first "political" definition with nostalgic
 overtones.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his accompanying commentary upon the <I>Histoire(s)</I>, Godard
clearly articulates his nostalgia for the aura of lost cinema. We should
bear in mind here that he defines film neither as an art nor a science,
but rather as a "mystery," a word that invites interpretation in terms
of the auratic.
<SUP><A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 According to Miriam Hansen, the auratic in Benjamin never coincides
 with the unveiling of a symbolic integrity, but on the contrary with a
 "catastrophic and dislocating impact."
<SUP><A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The same is true of Godard's auratic cinema. In Godard's eyes, film is
 mysterious because it performs an allegorical movement, an alternating
 dispersion and concentration of signification. <I>Histoire(s)
 du cin&eacute;ma</I> aims to witness just that movement, in the
 process bringing to light the messianic possibility of a catastrophic
 change. Whereas for Benjamin history must attend to the experience
 of the vanquished, for Godard film must be given attention in so far
 as it has been vanquished by video, by digital technology, and more
 generally by what he defines as the "totalitarianism of the present"
 (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 286).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the most celebrated passage of the "Theses on the Philosophy of
History," Benjamin imagined history as the allegorical subject of
Klee's painting "Angelus Novus," a divine spectator who looks back on
the past while being propelled into the future amid a hail of debris by
a wind blowing from paradise ("TPH," 257-58). Strikingly, Benjamin
revives the metaphor at a pivotal juncture in "The Work of Art in the
Age of Mechanical Reproduction" when he imagines the advent of film:
"Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder by the dynamite
of the tenth of second, so that now, in the midst of its far-flung
ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go traveling" ("WOA,"
236). The resemblance of the two passages suggests that Benjamin at some
level associated cinema with the paradise from which the storm of the
future originates. Godard quite consciously appropriates and redeploys
this association. In the first, televised version of <I>Histoire(s) du
cin&eacute;ma</I>, at the end of Episode 1B, we thus encounter the image
of Klee's angel dramatically (and perhaps a bit self-aggrandizingly)
superimposed upon that of Godard himself (<I>NMQG</I>, 222). Behind
Godard's enterprise stands a Benjaminian insistence on the critical
recuperation of history, a retrieval of ephemeral images "flashing up"
to demand analysis in the present, because, as Benjamin puts it, "every
image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own
concerns threatens to disappear irretrievably" ("TPH," 255). Film offers
the ideal reservoir of such images, a reservoir that offers the advantage
of presenting historical events without adding causal explanations from
outside the events themselves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the philosophical standpoint of Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I> is the
same as that of Benjamin's "Theses," its methodology is closer to that
of <I>The Arcades Project</I>. Indeed, as an attempt to delineate the
specific physiognomy of the twentieth century from its fragmentary
cultural traces, through a collage of images and texts, <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I> reveals a genealogical relation to <I>The Arcades
Project</I>. As has been documented, Benjamin until the end of his life
pursued the project of a history of the "minor" or marginal, a project
applying the practices of historical materialism and articulated around
the emblematic res of the nineteenth century: arcades, whores,
gamblers, gilded mirrors, mechanical dolls. The resulting epigrammatic
sketches, organized into a kind of patchwork of quotations, contribute
to what Benjamin defined as a "dialectic at a standstill," a sort of
intransitive unveiling of the truth that avoids the illusion of linear
narrative progress. But as in the case of the "Theses," the theory
of collective memory developed in the <I>Arcades</I> also owes its
inspiration to the Proustian notion of involuntary memory, of which it
represents a sort of "objective," material aspect.
<SUP><A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> identifies the
twentieth-century analogue of the arcade in the movie theater. Like
the arcade, film is able to provide a centrifugal mode of access to
meaning and history. Not only do Benjamin and Godard both espouse a
poetics of montage or quotation, they also share a determination to
escape the strictures of conventional historicism in order to unveil
the allegorical res that arise from the ruins of history. Even
Godard's written commentary upon <I>Histoire(s)</I> mimics the visual
procedures of montage, linking as it does citations or pastiches of
a variety of authors--philosophers, film critics, songwriters, poets,
and directors--who are listed

<B></B>

at the end of each volume, but not individually attributed. Film clearly
represents for Godard a sort of private or personal historical arcade,
a spectacular space that provides us with an "involuntary memory" of
the century. In this light, Benjamin and Godard may be seen to share
much the same project; both aim to perform a materialist critique of
culture by means of Proustian acts of remembrance, to expose the hidden
costs of production by means of a poetic recovery of the past. Such a
critique, far from enforcing an objectively verifiable or scientific
picture of events, provides access to history via the digressive,
subjective paths of allegory. Godard underlines this emphasis when
he writes, "why simplify when one can complicate?" (<I>HDC</I>, II:
78). If history becomes legible for Benjamin by alternation between the
mystical perspective of the "Theses" and the materialist approach of
the <I>Arcades</I>, we find in Godard the possibility of bringing the
two modes into convergence through the language of cinema, a language
that according to Godard expresses the "egality and fraternity between
real and fiction" (<I>HDC</I>, III: 126-27).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>, however, Godard intends to
superimpose his personal experience upon the collective, public face
of cinema. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> is an autobiographical
enterprise in spirit, since the material traces of film are also
reflections of Godard's own personal life story.
<SUP><A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 As he himself phrases it, "without cinema I would not have any history"
 (<I>HDC</I>, II: 39). Proclaiming the visual language of film as the
 mother tongue of the twentieth century, Godard refuses to provide
 an ostensibly objective, chronological overview of the medium. To
 the question of historical origin he responds instead by taking the
 invention of motion pictures as the revolutionary new beginning of a
 certain way of looking at the world, the emergence of cinema in this
 sense standing for the birth of a peculiarly modern consciousness of
 estrangement. We thus find three historical levels "superimposed" on one
 another in the <I>Histoire(s)</I>: the personal, the communal, and the
 cinematic. The titles of the first two segments--"Toutes les histoires"
 and "Une histoire seule"--imply the constantly viable possibility in
 <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> of a <I>Gestalt</I> switch between
 two ways of thinking about the medium: in terms of its social currency
 as spectacle or in terms of its psychical value as allegory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is well known that Deleuze's theory of cinema divides the history of
the medium into two periods: that of the "movement-image" and that of the
"time-image." Coinciding with Italian Neorealism and the French New Wave,
the second period represents the equivalent of a Kantian revolution
of cinema in as much as it overturns the silent era's subordination of
temporality to movement and instead comes to enact what Deleuze, employing
a very Proustian formulation, calls "temps &agrave; l'&eacute;tat pur."
<SUP><A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 We might surmise that it is because the most recent productions
 of the movie industry threaten to eradicate art cinema between
 Hollywood's bloated overcommodification of the medium and the
 atemporality of digital technology that Godard resolves to resurrect
 the time-image. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> should be regarded
 as an exploration of the autobiographical value of the time-image,
 an effort advanced in a Proustian mood to distill from the fractured
 remnants of the past a "pure history." If Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I>
 shares with Proust's <I>Recherche</I> a similar inspiration we should
 also note that it runs a

<B></B>

similar risk of appealing to a regressive or at least nostalgic
mentality. Since film (as opposed to television or video) represents
for Godard a sort of idealized childhood of the arts, his enterprise
in <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> may be regarded, like Proust's
in <I>&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu</I>, as an attempt to regain
infancy (<I>HDC</I>, I: 238).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Godard, cinema is best defined not in terms of ontological
presence &agrave; la Bazin, but rather in terms of metaphorical
and historical representation (<I>ACMS</I>, 67). And like Proust,
Godard affirms a poetics of shock or paradox by cultivating visual
superimposition in order to sustain epistemelogical instabilities, by
performing a "batt&eacute;ments" of images, a deployment of signs that
we might describe in Benjaminian accents as a "beating of wings."
<SUP><A NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 At stake in this agitated beating of images is the "fatal beauty" of
 film, its uniquely sublime quality. As Godard declares elsewhere in
 <I>Histoire(s)</I>, "only cinema" mobilizes itself with such unnerving
 ostentation. To better highlight the metaphorical function of film,
 Godard, like Proust, actively experiments with the condensation and
 displacement of images, confronting us with a visual archive of the
 century that exemplifies the paradox of superimposition: "That which
 is above all at the base, it's always two, always presenting from
 the start two images instead of one; it's what I define as the image,
 this image made of two, that is to say the third image" (<I>ACMS</I>,
 27). As a strategy of visualization, superimposition corresponds to a
 complicated and enigmatic philosophy of history within whose terms the
 past manifests itself as a palimpsest that is always in the process of
 being revised. Godard, the narrator, orients our cinematic excursion
 through the labyrinth of history by means of a sardonic, frequently
 melancholic commentary that propounds a poetics of quotation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jacques Aumont interprets the melancholic tone as the lament of
an artist-critic for his lost or defunct art (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>,
168). By way of an allegorical recapitulation of the project of the
<I>Recherche</I>, Godard aspires to recapture his ideal of the "film
perdu," once a certain type of cinema has run its course:

We can say, in general, that a certain idea of cinema, not
Lumi&egrave;re's but that which was perhaps pursued by Feuillade and
continued by Delluc, Vigo, and from which I do not consider myself to be
far, this idea of cinema is over, as the Fontainebleau school is over,
as Italian painting is over. . . . One can say that a certain cinema has
now been achieved. As Hegel put it, an epoch is finished. Afterward it
is different. One feels sad because childhood has been lost. (

Just like literature in the <I>Recherche</I>, cinema in <I>Histoire(s)</I>
is not "sheltered from time," but simply "the shelter of time"
(<I>HDC</I>, IV: 299). This is another way of saying that Godard's
<I>Histoire(s)</I> does not embrace the machinery of archival history. To
the order of the archive, Godard opposes the aura of involuntary memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, Godard's intuitive, dream-like layering of images resembles
involuntary memory more than it does organized montage. As if to drive
the point home, during the four-hour course of the <I>Histoire(s)</I>
we are repeatedly shown a self-referential scene of the director gazing
with somewhat lax attention at the film as it passes by on his editing
table. Although we might regard such an image as a way of thematizing
the hermeneutical problematic of the film, that problematic is framed
by Godard not in

<B></B>

analytic terms, as Bergala has remarked, but in emotional terms, in terms
of distress and consolation: "We should most of all refrain from thinking,
<I>before the authority of the completed work</I>, that Godard has always
been sure about which <I>shots</I> he was looking for, and that he knew
in which films and in which place in those films to find them. The most
troubling shots are those regained when they were inaccessible to the
convocation of his voluntary memory" (<I>NMQG</I>, 241).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the choice of images that constitute the <I>Histoire(s)</I> we should
recognize not so much Godard's logical ordering of experience as his
spontaneous election to an intensified state of consciousness by his
memories of forgotten films. The obsessive return of certain images
suggests that Godard has been chosen by his memories in so far as he
allows them to resurface.
<SUP><A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 We might say that Godard unveils the Proustian unconsciousness of
 cinema to the extent that he reveals even montage in its ostensible
 identity as a visual technology to obey the involuntary rhythms of the
 subjective. A sly illustration of this point may be found in Episode 3B
 (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 17), where, after an eruption of fragments from
 Rossellini's <I>Pais&agrave;</I> and Carn&eacute;'s <I>La belle et la
 b&ecirc;te</I>, we abruptly encounter the legend, "Hardly Working,"
 which ironically raises the question of the psychic labor behind the
 editing. Although, on the one hand, montage may be work, its result
 resembles the effortless arbitrariness of the involuntary. It is on this
 ground that Aumont rightly considers Godard to be Proust's "brother"
 (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 225).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Aumont's judgment is to some extent invited by the director; in Episode
2B of the <I>Histoire(s)</I>, which is entitled "Fatale beaut&eacute;,"
references to the <I>Recherche</I> are made openly and at some
length. Godard emphatically repeats the name of Marcel's vanished
and mysterious love, Albertine. On the screen the phrase "le temps
perdu" flashes out several times. This evocation of Proust's enigmatic
female protagonist occurs not accidentally during a meditation on the
nature of cinema, which Godard equates with its function neither as
art nor as technique, but as <I>mystery</I>: "I said: neither an art,
nor a technique, but a mystery (voice of Godard). Time regained. Only
cinema. All alone. Mystery" (<I>HDC</I>, II: 154-55). Yet his very
insistence on the value of film as the embodiment of regained time
may also be read as an admission of the medium's untimely status or
condition. If the <I>Recherche</I> is written at the dawn of cinema,
the <I>Histoire(s)</I> awakens to its sunset, a distance that Godard
captures by ironically rewriting Proust's famous first sentence, "for a
long time I used to go to sleep early," as "for a long time I used to
wake up unhappily." The punning conversion of "early" ("bonne heure"
in the original version, which itself echoes "bonheur"--happiness)
to "unhappily" ("malheur" in the original) or unhappiness brings to
light at once the proximate, but also mutated, condition of Godard's
present relative to Proust's past. The director's mise-en-sc&egrave;ne
must dispense with elegiac niceties, and his own search for lost cinema
will be conducted, according to Aumont, as the potential final chapter
in the history of art (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 149). Indeed, immediately
after airing his revision of Proust's incipit, Godard indulges in a bit
of wordplay on the phrase "le temps retrouv&eacute;" (time regained)
by typographically highlighting the "trou," the hole or empty space,
at the heart of the adjective "retrouv&eacute;."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's opus is Proustian in spirit because it manages to evoke the
involuntary intermittence of our memories of film in a first-person
narrative voice: "All that remains

<B></B>

of films are a few images in our memory" (<I>ACMS</I>, 85). Moreover,
for the French director the history of cinema does not contribute
to any larger optimism regarding the revolutionary triumph of the
social collective. Instead, Godard's historical outlook derives from
an anxious sense of the singularity and frailty of personal memory,
and it is in this light that his aims can be considered Proustian. His
effort is not to construct a systematic catalog of film memories that
provide immediate access to history, but to retrieve a few fragmentary
touchstones that, like Proust's involuntary memories, redeem the past
by means of indication or suggestion. Paradoxically, these touchstones
can be recovered only through a process of forgetting. It is precisely
in the readiness of consciousness to brave the threat of erasure
that he locates the possibility of recollection as an aesthetic act:
"Whoever wishes to remember must trust to oblivion, to that risk which
is absolute oblivion, and to the beautiful accident that might then
become the remembrance" (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 128-29). Whereas the
visual composition of <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> demonstrates
that films may provide the material analogue <I>par excellence</I> of
memory, Godard's assertion implies that their evocative power rests on
what Aumont defines as "amn&eacute;sie."
<SUP><A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 It is Godard's intention to save a select few auratic images and thus the
 essence of art cinema at the very moment when the cybernetic practice
 of the information archive or database seemingly replaces that of a
 living cultural memory (<I>NMQG</I>, 216).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's cultivation of a sort of involuntary memory of cinema shows
to what degree cinema as a medium is well suited, probably better than
literature, to elaborate the phenomenology of remembrance.
<SUP><A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 He suggests that, by virtue of its nonchalance of retrospection,
 film makes it possible to rewrite the myth of Orpheus in a less
 tragic key than literature permits: "Cinema authorizes Orpheus to
 turn back without killing" (<I>HDC</I>, II: 96-97). However,
 if the history of cinema revises the ideology of involuntary memory
 in a compelling way, <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> at the same
 time bears witness to the approaching terminus of that history, to the
 disappearance of film's Orphic potential. In this light, the Proust
 who is a true brother to Godard is not only a disenchanted, Deleuzian
 semiotician, but also an elegiac spirit for whom "the true paradises are
 the paradises that we have lost" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 903; <I>RDTP</I>, IV:
 449). <I>Histoire(s)</I> ends on a freeze-frame of a rose superimposed
 over a still image of Godard himself. Over this literally arresting
 vision, the voiceover intones "if a man crossing paradise in a dream
 received a flower as proof of his transit and, on awakening, found
 the flower in his hands, what else would he say but I was this man"
 (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 306-11).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is at the intersection of the Proustian poetic of involuntary memory
with the Benjaminian doctrine of messianic history, then, that we should
position Godard's faith in the resurrection of cinema. After all, at its
invention the medium of film was taken so seriously as a technological
means of resuscitating the dead that, as Christian-Marc Boss&eacute;no
reminds us, somebody in 1905 went about providing cemeteries with
projectors to show movies of the dearly departed.
<SUP><A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In this light, Godard's redemptive valediction to art cinema looks
 back through a messianic conception of the medium to the very origin of
 film itself, so completing a circular motion that is a quintessentially
 Proustian authorial gesture.

In this sense, I find the accusations advanced against Ruiz's film on
the grounds of having taken excessive liberties with Proust's novel to be
misplaced and banal. Predictably, many literary critics have complained
about the supposed original sin of a cinematic version of Proust. Film
critics generally have been better disposed toward the film, although
they often praise it in vague and generalized terms. For an example of
a typical critique of Ruiz's project from a literary point of view, see
Pascal Ifri, "Le Temps Retrouv&eacute; de Roul Ruiz, ou Le Temps Perdu
au Cinema" <I>Bulletin Marcel Proust</I> 50 : 166-75. For an
example of film criticism, see Thyerry Gandillot, "Du C&ocirc;t&eacute;
de chez Proust," <I>L'Express</I> (20 May 2000): 47.

Like Carter, Henry seems sure that Proust saw a "courte-metrage comique"
at least once, but that the silent films shown in Parisian movie houses
(for example, M&eacute;li&egrave;s and, as of 1917, Chaplin) cannot have
influenced Proust, as his writing already evinces a fascination with the
visual beginning with <I>Jean Santeuil</I> in 1895. Henry argues that
the genealogy of Proust's ocular imagination derives from the progressive
spectacularization of the arts and of communication since the nineteenth
century. Anne Henry, <I>La tentation de Marcel Proust</I> (Paris: PUF,

"Someone had indeed had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on
evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used
to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come;
and, after the fashion of the master-builders and glass-painters of
Gothic days, it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable
iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends
were depicted as on a shifting and transitory window. . . . And, indeed,
I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which seemed to
emanate from a Merovingian past and shed around me the reflections of
such ancient history. But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at this
intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in
filling with my own personality until I thought no more of it than of
myself" (<I>ROTP</I>, I: 9-11; <I>RDTP</I>, I: 9-10). In this
passage, Proust seems to provide a possible link between the luminosity
of stained glass and the projectedness of film, a spectral effect that he
associates with the two terms "mystery" and "beauty." The former term, we
should note, also supplies Godard's definition of cinema in <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I>. In fact, one of the litanies recurring throughout
his film is the sentence "neither an art, nor a technique, a mystery."

The invention of superimposition dates back to the first generation of
cinematographers (1895-1927), who were active roughly in the same
years in which Proust was writing. We might define the technique as the
layering or fusing together of multiple exposures within the same shot,
permitting the condensation or dilation of time and space, and thus the
production of an image endowed with a third dimension besides length
and width--that is to say, depth.

This hypothesis finds support in Benjamin's own selection of examples for
his decidedly cinematic idea of the "optical unconscious," examples that
remind us of the specific instances of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>
catalogued in the final section of the <I>Recherche</I>. In his celebrated
essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", Benjamin
equates the optical unconscious with such peculiar moments of perception
as when we notice "a person's posture during the fraction of a stride"
and "the act of reaching for a spoon and how it might fluctuate with
our moods." It is striking how closely these examples resemble the two
crucial instances of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> at the end of
the <I>Recherche</I> when the narrator trips over a cobblestone and
overhears the sound of a spoon knocked against a plate (<I>ROTP</I>,
III: 900; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 446). It could be said that Benjamin exposes
the cinematic unconscious of the novel in the sense that he reveals the
<I>Recherche</I> as an "involuntary" exploration of the filmic. See

Driving this point home, Ruiz's adaptation of <I>Le temps
retrouv&eacute;</I> opens promisingly with the tableau of the author
on his deathbed, surrounded in his room by his <I>paper&ocirc;les</I>
and Celeste Albaret. (In the <I>Recherche</I> the narrator's cerebral
seizure, a virtual "review" of death, takes place at the end of <I>Le
temps retrouv&eacute;</I>.) Ruiz not only deliberately conflates the
narrator's life with Proust's own, but also strategically displaces
the approach of death from its logical position to the very start of
the film. Unfortunately, the cleverness of the film's opening is more
than offset by the gimmickry of its closure, as Ruiz attempts a sort
of extradiegetic deconstruction of the idea of film as biography. The
movie closes on the beach at Balbec where "Marcel enfant" is looked
upon by "Marcel adulte," in a sequence too studiedly reminiscent of
Visconti's adaptation of <I>Death in Venice</I>. Meanwhile, a voice-over
recounts the story of the sculptor Salvini who, as his end draws near,
is offered an opportunity to review all the significant moments of his
life by the angel of death. Salvini refuses, pleading instead for the
right merely to reassess his last work of art, entitled the "Triumph
of Death." However, this act of self-judgment proves impossible:
"There is a paradox in all this, Salvini exclaimed, I had enough time
to review all the instants of my life, which lasted sixty-three years,
and the same amount of time has not sufficed for surveying a work which
I finished within three months." As the angel of death explains, the
reason for the paradox is the fact that a work of art embodies not only
the author's life, but indeed the lives of all people. This story, which
does not come from the <I>Recherche</I>, is an awkward interpolation,
as it establishes an apparently transcendental distinction between life
and oeuvre, autobiography and fiction, that Proust had carefully tried
to efface. See Raoul Ruiz et Gilles Taurand, "Le temps retrouv&eacute;,"

As will be evident to anyone who has read his recent interviews about
<I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>, Godard seems drawn to Benjamin
as a source of constant intellectual reflection. One example of
Benjamin's influence is Godard's frequent recurrence to the word
"constellation"--with explicit reference to the German critic's
precedent--in order to signify his intention to establish a resonance
between present and past. As Youssef Ishaghpour observes, allusions to
Benjamin are also preponderant in a recent film by Godard and Anne Marie
