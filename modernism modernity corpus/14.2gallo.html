<p id="lead">Very little has been published on John Dos Passos's frequent travels to Mexico in the late 1920s and early 1930s. These trips are mentioned in passing by his biographers, but so far no critics have tried to find out more details about what Dos Passos might have done during his journeys south of the border: did he meet any Mexican writers or artists? Did his works find a readership among local intellectuals? Did he have contact with any of the numerous foreign intellectuals who had made Mexico their temporary home? The latter is an especially important question, given that during the 1920s and 1930s Mexico had become a cultural magnet, drawing illustrious visitors from almost every corner of the world: Arthur Cravan, Tina Modotti, Edward Weston, D.H. Lawrence, André Breton, Antonin Artaud, Sergei Eisenstein, and Leon Trotsky all spent time in Mexico during this period, and certainly Dos Passos must have crossed paths with at least some of them. So whom did he meet? Whom did he read? What did he think of the heated debates about art and national identity that dominated the intellectual scene after the end of the Revolution? Did he find a kindred soul in any of the poets or painters that had made their home in Mexico City? In order to answer these questions, let's look a bit more closely at John Dos Passos's comings and goings in the 1920s.  </p>

<p>Dos Passos first became interested in Mexico in 1914, when he read John Reed's <i>Insurgent Mexico, </i>but he did not travel there until 1926, when he wrote several articles for <i>New Masses</i> about Mexican muralism and the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Shortly after the launch of <i>New Masses</i> in 1926, Dos Passos wrote a long, enthusiastic profile on Diego Rivera's murals at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, but it is unclear if he ever 

<b></b>

met Rivera in person.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  He also published some impressions about the noise, poverty, and chaos of Mexico City, as well as a short article on the lot of peasants in the state of Morelos, where the revolutionary Zapata had lived and fought.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  During this trip Dos Passos also painted several watercolors based on his impressions: <i>Man with Hat </i>[<a href="#1">re 1</a>] and <i>Trio with Straws</i> [<a href="#2">re 2</a>]. Both of these works reveal a fascination with the people of the Mexican countryside; they appear as mysterious, hermetic beings that seem frozen in another era.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  He went back to New York in March 1927, but would return to Mexico in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1946, though he only wrote about his experiences during the 1926–27 trip (except for the fictionalized Mexico City that appears in <i>The 42</i><sup>nd</sup><i> Parallel</i>).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The dearth of material on Dos Passos's visit to Mexico has led his biographers to conclude that these trips were of little or no importance. They did not seem to have left an important mark on his work, and perhaps were no more than extended holidays for the American writer. The Mexico journeys, for instance, receive no more than a passing mention in Virginia Spencer Carr's biography <i>Dos Passos: A Life</i>.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  And Melvin Landsberg asserts that the Mexico trips were rather inconsequential since "it was the Bolshevik and not the Mexican revolution that Dos Passos heard about constantly and discussed with his associates in the theater and staff of <i>New Masses</i>." <sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>There is, however, some evidence that there was more to Dos Passos's journeys to Mexico—especially the 1926–27 trip—than first meets the eye. Dos Passos met at least one foreign artist during his first trip: the Italian-born photographer Tina Modotti, who lived in Mexico for most of the 1920s and photographed him wearing a <i>sarape</i> and standing next to a man wearing a sombrero. Modotti did not comment on their meeting, but she did annotate her portrait by writing "Dos Passos" on the photographic print [<a href="#3">re 3</a>].  </p>

<p>But there were some more significant encounters during Dos Passos's first trip to Mexico. He met Salvado Novo, an extravagant young poet who was one of the founders of the avant-garde journal <i>Contemporáneos</i> and the author of several books of experimental poetry and an erotic autobiography that was so scandalous that it was only published in the 1990s.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In the spring of 1927 Novo accompanied Dos Passos on a short road trip to the mountains near Puebla. Novo, an enthusiastic reader of American poetry—he had translated Carl Sandburg for one of the literary journals he edited –, had founded an experimental theater in Mexico City, and was extremely interested in novels that broke out from the constraints of traditional narrative forms, and thus he would have been naturally interested in meeting another experimental novelist. Likewise, Dos Passos probably enthused at the idea of spending a few days with a local writer who could introduce him to the literary and artistic scene in Mexico City. </p>

<p>Their meeting, however, did not end so well. Novo and Dos Passos soon discovered they had very little in common and they disagreed on everything from politics to traveling styles. Dos Passos had come to Mexico hoping to meet peasants whose lives had been transformed by the Revolution—the type of citizens portrayed in Rivera's murals – and who could tell him about land reform, revolutionary politics, and socialist art. Novo, in contrast, was an upper middle class dandy who despised the Mexican

<p>We can see how radically different their outlook on the world was by looking at how both authors wrote about Mexico City. In "Relief Map of Mexico," his 1926 article for <i>New Masses</i>, Dos Passos painted the sharp, almost violent clashes of the old and the new, the rich and the poor found on the streets of the capital: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Under the brittle cold sky, under the invariable sun, Mexico City stretches out its gridiron of streets, the green squares full of flowers, the low red vaults, and the towers leaning this way and that, of dusty colonial buildings. On the streets old men with spectacles, young girls, young women in shawls, barefoot children sell lottery tickets, candied cactus and sweet potatoes, chiclets, cigarettes, lottery tickets, chiclets, lottery tickets, chiclets. In the stores the storekeepers, Gallegos, Catalans, Jews, Germans, Frenchmen, shake their heads over the morning's paper. Business is bad, depressed, stagnant. In Sanborn's tearoom, drugstore, department store, citadel of Yanquilandia, traveling men from the States talk about bad business, scare each other with a new revolution every day, and at last apply to their hopes the healing balm of "eventually we'll intervene." [ . . . ] Ten million Mexican peasants and workmen, disunited, confused by political rows, sleeping on a straw mat on the floor, eating off a few tortillas a day and a speck of chile to take away the raw taste of the corn, standing up in their fields against the Catholic Church, against the two world groups of petroleum interests, against the inconceivably powerful financial juggernaut of the Colossus of the North.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p class="continued">Novo, who would later become the official "Chronicler of Mexico City," wrote thousands of pages about Mexico City, but his eye captured a reality that seems entirely different from that depicted by Dos Passos. In <i>El joven</i>, a short autobiographical work written in 1923, he enthuses about the vibrant metropolis that Mexico City had become in the few years since the end of the revolution: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p>Novo presents Mexico City as a modern, cosmopolitan center full of cars, tramways, billboards, and ubiquitous advertising campaigns. Dos Passos, in contrast, sees a third-world town inhabited by displaced peasants and exploited by unsympathetic foreigners. Novo saw his city's ubiquitous ads as a much needed opening towards the rest of the world, following almost a decade of isolation during the Revolution. Dos Passos, in contrast, would have seen the billboards and slogans as an incursion of American and European capitalism, an intrusion into an otherwise traditional country. </p>

<p>As we can imagine, the two writers made an awkward couple as they traveled through the Mexican countryside. A few days after their trip was completed, Novo published the following account of their journey in the first issue of <i>Ulises</i>, a literary journal he edited with his fellow poet Xavier Villaurrutia.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>John Dos Passos, originally from Portugal, as his name shows, has lived in the United States for three generations. He has published <i>Three Soldiers</i>, <i>Rocinante </i>[sic] <i>to the Road Again</i>, <i>Manhattan Transfers</i> [sic]. He was hidden among us for one month. We traveled to Puebla together, and I was able to observe that he is bald, cross-eyed, and thirty years old, though he appears younger, as one can suppose. Of the geniuses working in his native land, for instance, he only knows Carl Sandburg personally, but not my friend Ch. Morley. Though he fought in the war as a known soldier, he has no sympathy for Allan Seeger or Joyce Kilmer. He tells me that if they hadn't died in the war . . . He also tells me some other extravagant things: that he used to like the poetry of Juan Ramón Jiménez when he was learning Spanish. Now he speaks it very well. He has a terrible memory. He eats a lot. One day, as he was preparing to travel to Oaxaca, he went back to New York to work on a play. We've decided to call him John Two Step.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> <b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo was a witty writer with a black sense of humor, and he never missed an opportunity to make fun of his more earnest colleagues, especially if they were, like Dos Passos, foreigners in search of an idealized Mexico. </p>

<p>Novo was amused to discover that he, a Mexican, knew more about American poetry —or at least about a certain type of American poetry—than Dos Passos. Christopher Morley, Alan Seeger, and Joyce Kilmer were all authors that Novo read enthusiastically but were unfamiliar to Dos Passos. Ironically, Dos Passos's novels were virtually unknown in the Spanish-speaking world—Novo remarks twice that he had not read Dos Passos—until 1929, when the first translation of <i>Manhattan Transfer</i> was published in Spain.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Novo wrote a longer, more detailed account of their road trip for <i>El Universal Ilustrado</i>, an illustrated weekly edited by Carlos Noriega Hope that had become one of the liveliest platforms for young artists and writers and regularly featured works by artists like Diego Rivera and Tina Modotti, as well as poetry and essays by young writers. In this piece, called simply "México-Puebla," Novo parodies Dos Passos's telegraphic, impressionistic style as he recounts their journey, switching from Spanish to English and back again, and throwing a few sarcastic jabs at his fellow traveler. Consider, for instance, Novo's opening paragraph: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A fine morning this is. ¿A qué hora empezaremos a hablar de literatura? John dos Passos. Por tres generaciones ha vivido en los Estados Unidos. Yo no conozco sus libros. No es tan famoso, o qué pasa. Ahora pela una naranja y se la come. Brrrr!<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>
<p>[<i>A fine morning this is</i>. When do we start talking about literature? John Dos Passos. For three generations he has lived in the United States. I haven't read his books. He's not that famous or what's the problem. He peels an orange and eats it. Brrr!]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As before, Novo makes fun of what he perceived as Dos Passos's American eccentricities. As someone living in a racially mixed culture in which ethnic origins were less important than a national identity that claimed to supersede racial difference—the post-revolutionary national discourse proclaimed that all Mexicans were <i>mestizos</i>– , Novo must have found odd the American custom of identifying one's ethnicity based on the nationality of ancestors who emigrated in a distant past. Parodying this custom, he writes that Dos Passos "has lived in the United States for three generations."  </p>

<p>Throughout the article, Novo debunks Dos Passos's vision of Mexico as an exotic land. "All these American journalists," he writes, "are like detectives in a film. They've come to discover something." Novo refuses to be the native subject, the exotic other, and goes on to mock his travel companion's fascination with the country's most popular tourist attractions. On the way to Puebla, for instance, the pair drove by the Popocatepetl, an active volcano on the edge of the Valley of Mexico and one of the most dramatic symbols of the Mexican countryside. Dos Passos must have been impressed as they contemplated the massive peak, but Novo gives the following irreverent account of their journey:

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>¡Oh! ¡el Popocatepetl! Odioso mamarracho. Se le ve desde todas partes. Lo pintan en los teatros y en algunos cafés. También hay tarjetas postales. Fume nu. .. Están decorando ese monte. Va a parecer un cake de chocolate con el letrero completo. Otra vez ese mamarracho con nubes de trapo. Tiene nieve de mal sabor. Coloso, vigía, todos los adjetivos. Hay muchos otros. ¡Hasta cuándo se hundirá de una vez?<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> </p>
<p>[Oh, Popocatepetl! What a hideous pile. It can be seen from all places, even on the wall paintings inside theaters and coffee houses. And on postcards. "Smoke Numb . . . " They're decorating this hill. It's going to end up looking like a chocolate <i>cake</i> with a sign and everything. Again that pile and its fake clouds. Covered with ice, but not creamy enough. Colossus, beacon, followed by all the adjectives. And there are many others. When will it sink for good?]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo had another occasion to parody local color when he and Dos Passos drove by a village festival, which the Mexican poet describes as follows:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Ya empe Pum! zó el festival. Ya se ha de ir a acabar, ¿Cuál música oimos? Titutli camixtli huixitli clap clap clalp clap clap clap clap clap. Traducido ya no es lo mismo. Clap clap.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>
<p>[The festival has star-BOOM!-ted. It'll be over soon. What kind of music did we hear? Titutli camixtli huixitli clap clap clalp clap clap clap clap clap. It's not the same in translation: Clap clap.]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo parodies the sound of Indigenous words and names: to foreign ears the village chants sound like "Titutli camixtli huixitli," but only the clapping can be translated. </p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the text is a bilingual section in which Novo recounts how the two shared a hotel room and suggests that the American novelist might have been less than thrilled to find himself in such close quarters with a gay man: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>En este cuarto John y yo [In this room John and I]. May I call you John? And will you call me Salvador? We sit each evening and never speak ta ta ta tárara tarí lará. Había agua caliente. Ahora no. [There was hot water. But no longer.] I don't mind. But I do. Hello Folkways. This is your room here. Let's go n' have supper ; we still have to visit some night schools.</p>
<p>[ . . . ]</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		What are you reading there, John?</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Why er er de la Selva's.</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Ouh.</p>
<p>Silencio. Si-len-cio. S-S-S-S.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The article ends on a comical note: Novo and Dos Passos reading in bed, like an old married couple, one hushing the other so he can continue reading undisturbed. Strange bedfellows indeed! </p>

<p>In the end, not much came out of John Dos Passos's encounter with Novo, a writer so irreverent and so acerbic that it would not be unfair to characterize him as the Mexican avant-garde's foremost bitchy queen. Their encounter was as ill-fated as the legendary meeting between Proust and Joyce: two writers who everyone imagined would have much in common but who ultimately had nothing to talk about.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Dos Passos met other poets during his brief stay in Mexico City, and some of his literary encounters were to be more productive—and probably more pleasant—than his road trip with Novo. He was introduced, for instance, to Manuel Maples Arce, the founder of Estridentismo, an avant-garde movement loosely based on Italian Futurism that had been active in Mexico City since 1921. Maples Arce was also Novo's archrival in the capital's small but explosive literary scene. </p>

<p>At the time of Dos Passos's visit, Mexico had not one but two avant-garde movements: the poets gathered around the journal <i>Contemporáneos </i>and the Estridentistas (the name translates as "noise makers"), who published the journals <i>Irradiador</i> and <i>Horizonte</i> in the 1920s. The two groups were considered avant-garde but they could not be more different: the Contemporáneos consisted of young poets who, like Novo, read French and English, admired Joyce and Proust, and wrote about the literary scene in Paris, Madrid, London, and New York; the Estridentistas, in contrast, penned outrageous manifestoes proposing, among other things, sending "Chopin to the electric chair," and urging readers to come "Down with Father Hidalgo," one of Mexican founding fathers.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The Contemporáneos were, for the most part, uninterested in politics, or at considered poetry as a practice that went beyond political matters. Their poems explored transcendental themes like love, death, desire and melancholy. The Estridentistas, in contrast, were fiercely political: they considered their movement as a literary extension of the Mexican Revolution, and believed avant-garde experiments were part and parcel of social activism, and wrote poetry about labor unions, worker revolts, and political manifestations. The Contemporáneos read Joyce in well-appointed salons; the Estridentistas postered their manifestoes on city streets and marched in workers' parades. The Contemporáneos were a gay-friendly group; the Estridentistas, in contrast, were known for homophobic pronouncements and their defense of a "virile" Mexican literature.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  One of the lines in <i>Urbe</i> lambasts the "asalta-braguetas literarios" or "literary crotch-gropers"—a not so subtle reference to the sexual tastes of several members of the Contemporáneos group.  </p>

<p>Had Dos Passos gone on a road trip with one of the Estridentistas instead of Novo, his experience would have been completely different. Bt though he did not travel with a member of the group, he did read their work, and was so impressed with <i>Urbe</i>, Manuel Maples Arce's best known poem, that he translated it into English: he called it <i>Metropolis</i> and published it in New York. The book, featuring a color frontispiece illustrating the modern city hailed by Maples Arce [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], was self-published—the cover merely states "New York, 1929"—and is now extremely rare. One of the few remaining copies is at the New York Public Library. </p>

<p>Maples Arce had originally published <i>Urbe</i> in 1924, a year before <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>, and its full title was <i>Urbe: superpoema bolchevique en cinco cantos</i> [Urbe: super-Bolshevik poem in five cantos], and was dedicated to "the workers of Mexico." In it, Maples Arce hails the modern metropolis, bustling with cars and tramways, crowded with workers and factories. It features the same Dionysian enthusiasm for modernity and machinery found in F.T. Marinetti's manifestoes, with the difference, of course, that Mexico City in 1920 was less industrial and less modern than European capitals 

<b></b>

in 1909. The industrial cityscape presented in verses like "O city all tense / with cables and strains /all humming with motors and wings" was an imaginary space, a far cry from the everyday reality of Mexico City, where modernity coexisted with tradition: there were "cables" and "motors" but also <i>pulquerías</i> and horse-drawn carriages.</p>

<p>Although Maples Arce opened his first manifesto of Estridentismo by invoking Marinetti, his theory of the relation between politics and literature was significantly different from that proposed by the Italian poet. Unlike Marinetti, Maples Arce believed that modernity went hand-in-hand with socialist reforms. Progressive politics are as modern as the machines celebrated in <i>Urbe</i>, and workers' manifestations are one more element of the city's modernization depicted in the poem: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p><i>The rivers of blue overalls <br />
overflow the dams of the factories<br />
and the agitator trees<br />
gesticulate speeches.<br /> 
Strikers pelt each other<br />
with stones and insults <br />
and life is one tumultuous <br />
conversion to the left.</i><sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 

<b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">And unlike Marinetti, who lambasted writers who wrote poetry about women, Maples Arce has no problem inserting an old-fashioned love poem ("Poor Celia Maria Dolores<i> . . . </i>") in the midst of his mechanical stridencies. He even manages to sneak in a couple of surrealist images by evoking the name of a random hick town in his bustling metropolis ("Ocotlán / there in the distance"). </p>

<p>It is easy to see why, of all the publications he might have discovered in Mexico City, Dos Passos decided to translate <i>Urbe</i>, a poem that is remarkably similar, in its focus, imagery, and use of language, to <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>. Like Dos Passos's most famous novel, <i>Urbe</i> depicts urban modernity, celebrating the energy and violence found in spaces where millions vie for success. "Metropolis," the term Dos Passos chose for the English translation of Maples Arce's poem, is also the title of the second section of <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>. Novo was also an enthusiast of the modern city, but unlike Maples Arce and Dos Passos he was not interested in documenting the social tensions, the juxtaposition of riches and squalor that readers find in both <i>Urbe</i> and <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>.  </p>

<p>Like <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>, <i>Urbe</i> juxtaposes images from urban life to create a kaleidoscopic text.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Consider, for instance, the following paragraph from Dos Passos's novel describing a character admiring a fireworks display: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Rockets spurting bright in the blue dusk, colored balls falling, Bengal fire, Uncle Jeff tacking pinwheels on the tree outside the apartmenthouse door, lighting them with his cigar. Roman candles you have to hold. "Be sure and turn your face away, kiddo." Hot thud and splutter in your hands, eggshaped balls soaring, red, yellow, green, smell of powder and singed paper.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Dos Passos moves with dizzying speed from one location to another (from the sky to the city street), from object to object, and from characters' thoughts to their actions, just like Maples Arce does in <i>Urbe</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p><i>This new depth of landscape<br />
is a projection onto inner mirrorings.<br />Roaring crowds <br />today overflow the city squares <br />and the triumphal hurrahs <br />of the Obregonistas<br />rattle in the sun of the facades.<br />O romantic girl<br />all a flareup of fold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps between my hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only these live moments will remain.<br />The hills dressed in yellow <br />were asleep behind the windowglass<br />and the trammeled city <br />has been left trembling in the wires.<br />That wall is all handclapping. </i><b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Like <i>Manhattan Tranfer</i>, <i>Urbe</i> moves from a wide perspective over the cityscape to a narrow focus on individual characters, from panoramas to close-ups and back again.  </p>

<p>As a translator, Dos Passos proved to be extremely conservative. His translation is, for the most part, a literal, word-for-word rendition of Maples Arce's Spanish poem that ends up sounding rather cumbersome ("The show windows carry the sidewalks by storm / and the sun is sacking the long avenues"). He does not manage to recreate the energy of the original poem. One of MMA's characteristically violent exclamations, for instance: "Los discursos marihuanos / de los diputados / salpicaron de mierda su recuerdo" is rendered as "The speeches doped with marihuana / of the deputies / splatter crap on her memory." The message is there, but not the explosive use of language. Nevertheless, his was the first English translation of an Estridentista text –and, as far as I know, it is still the only one available –, though it remains virtually unknown. <i>Metropolis</i> is republished here for the first time since 1929.  </p>

<p>Dos Passos's first trip to Mexico City was significant for his divergent meetings with the capital's avant-gardes. His road trip with Novo reads like a comical demonstration of the fundamental incompatibility between two world visions. His discovery of Maples Arce, in contrast, lead to a fruitful intellectual exchange: Dos Passos became, at least for some time, the American ambassador of the Estridentista movement, translating and promoting its works abroad.  </p>

<br />

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> built all of iron and steel</i>
<br />
<i>The wharves, the drydocks</i>.
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i> of factories.</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Metropolis:</i>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i>Escorts of trolleycars</i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i>running up and down the insurrectory streets.</i>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i>The show windows carry the sidewalks by storm</i>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i>and the sun is sacking the long avenues.</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>On the margin of the days</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> marked off with telegraph poles</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> instantaneous landscapes flit</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>through systems of pneumatic tubes.</i>

<i>O the green</i>

<br />
<i>Under the noonhour's coy blinds</i>

 <br />
<i>the spiritual pentagram of dynamite.</i>
<br />
<i> Here is my poem:</i>
<br />
<i>Garlands of hurrahs streaming in the wind,</i>
<br />
 <i>flaring hair,</i>
<br />
<i>captive mornings in all eyes</i>.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>O city</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> full of music</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>built all out of mechanical rhythm.</i>
<br />

<i>This new depth of landscape
<br />
is a projection onto inner mirrorings.
<br />
 Roaring crowds
<br />
today overflow the city squares
<br />
and the triumphal hurrahs
<br />
of the Obregonistas
<br />
rattle in the sun of the facades.
<br />
 O romantic girl
<br />
all a flareup of fold,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps between my hands
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only these live moments will remain.
<br />
The hills dressed in yellow
<br />
were asleep behind the windowglass
<br />
and the trammeled city
<br />
has been left trembling in the wires.
<br />
That wall is all handclapping.
<br />
 "Good God".
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, it's the tidal wave of the crowd,
<br />
latter on the fringe of silence
<br />
we'll see the Aztec night grow to immensity.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Put out the light in the chandelier.
<br />
Among the mechanism of sleeplessness
<br />
desire with a million eyes
<br />
strokes the poor flesh."
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A steel bird
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has set its course for a star.
<br />
The harbor:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burning distances,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; factory smoke,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
above the orchestra tent
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her memory suns itself.
<br />
An overseas farewell leapt out from the shore.
<br />
 The motors sing
<br />
across the slaughtered landscape</i>

<p>
<i>The afternoon shot full of windows
<br />
floats above the telephone wires
<br />
and among the inverted
<br />
girders of this hour
<br />
hang bunches of mechanical goodbyes.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her marvelous youth
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went off one morning
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between my fingers
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the empty ponds
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of looking glasses
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shipwreck forgotten faces.
<br />
 The poor sindicalist city
<br />
scaffolded all over
<br />
with cries and hurrahing.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Workmen
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are red
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and yellow.
<br />
 Pistols have burst again into bloom
<br />
after the trample of speeches,
<br />
and while the lungs of the sick wind
<br />
suppurate,
<br />
 lost in the obscure corridors of music
<br />
some white sweetheart
<br />
shatters into withered petals.</i> </p>

<h2>4 </h2>

<p>
<i>Among the thickets of silence
<br />
Dusk licks up the blood of twilight.
<br />
The fallen stars
<br />
are dead birds
<br />
in the dreamless water
<br />
of the mirror.
<br />
 And the sonorous
<br />
Artillery of the Atlantic
<br />
faded away at last
<br />
into the distance.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the autumn trees
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breathes the night wind
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wind off Russia,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wind of immense tragedies.
<br />
 And the garden
<br />
yellowing
<br />
founders in shadow.
<br />
Suddenly the recollection of her
<br />
Sparkles in the dull room.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her gold words</i>

<b></b>

 <br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>sift over my memory.
<br />
The rivers of blue overalls
<br />
overflow the dams of the factories
<br />
and the agitator trees
<br />
gesticulate speeches.
<br />
Strikers pelt each other
<br />
with stones and insults
<br />
and life is one tumultuous
<br /></i>
conversion to the left.

</p>

 <p>
<i>At the edge of the pillow
<br />
the night is a sheer cliff
<br />
and sleeplessness
<br />
stays whirring in my brain.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Whose are these voices
<br />
skimming over the dark?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And those trains howling
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards gutted horizons.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldiers
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will sleep in hell tonight.</i>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>God,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of all this disaster
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only a few scraps
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so white
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of her memory
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are left in my hands. </i> </p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>
<i>The savage hordes of the black night
<br />
threw themselves on the shuddering town.
<br />
 The bay
<br />
all flowering
<br />
with masts and moons
<br />
pours out
<br />
over the gentle piano-score
<br />
her hands play,</i>
</p>

<p>

<br /><i>and the far away cry
<br />
of a steamboat
<br />
towards the northern sea:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodbye
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a shipwrecked continent.</i>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Between the wires of her name
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fluttered feathers of birds.</i>

<b></b>

 <br />
<i>Poor Celia Maria Dolores;
<br />
The landscape is inside us.
<br />
Under the axestrokes of silence
<br />
the cast-iron buildings crumble.</i>

</p>
<p>
 
<i>The waves are of blood and the great hating clouds.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Desolation.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The speeches doped with marihuana
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the deputies
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; splatter crap on her memory,
<br />
 but
<br />
over the surging crowds of my soul
<br />
she has sifted her gentleness.</i>

</p>

<p>

<i>Ocotlan
<br />
there in the distance.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Voices.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detonations
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go pecking among the trenches.
<br />
 Desire threw stones all night
<br />
at the darkened windows of some virginity.</i>

</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Machinegun fire
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hacks off hunks of silence.</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>The streets
<br />
reverberating, empty
<br />
are rivers of darkness
<br />
pouring into the sea
<br />
and the sky
<br />
threadbare
<br />
is the new
<br />
 flag
<br />
that flares
<br />
over the city.</i></p>
