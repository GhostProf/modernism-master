There is a re concealed behind the curtains of Hugh Kenner's high modernism, or perhaps Hugh Modernism, that no matter how qualified of late has ineluctably become our own. The wizard manqu&#x000E9; hovers over the modernist critical edifice that is Kenner's enviable legacy, hiding in plain sight. This secret sharer holds an unexpected skeleton key to Kenner's modernist project, its gates glimmering before us like the illusory Emerald City. In Oz, the wizard's powers, while demystified as magic, are in essence the same techniques responsible for the magical effects of the film we watch spellbound. A similar Moebius strip effectively loops Kenner's construction of literary modernism's Radiant City with the seemingly humble machinations of the man in the projection booth. The largely unacknowledged animating spirit behind Kenner's modernism is Marshall McLuhan, the technical ghost in the modernist machine.
</p>

<p>
This probe implies no diminution of Kenner's indubitable originality. It does matter, though, that McLuhan's early work provides the template for the variant of modernism that thanks to Kenner we know best. The negative dialectics of McLuhan's modern materialism trace their crop circles across the landscape of Kenner's modernity. There are farms within farms within farms in high modernism's cultural geography, no matter how cosmopolitan its surfaces, and on this imaginary farm Ezra Pound, in the judgment of McLuhan and then Kenner, rules the roost. The Moebius strip on whose planar surface high modernism was produced met in its impossible suture with McLuhan's theory of 

<b></b>

modernity at the embodied edge called "Ezra Pound." If the patient lying etherized on the table was modernity, Pound's material poetry transfused the sleeper, allowing the unconscious patient to awaken. A foreshortened history of how the early McLuhan peaks in Kenner's prime reveals an arc that ends for both in Pound, the double arc or double rainbow responsible for giving Pound's name to modernist making, making Pound the arbiter of <i>The Pound Era,</i> and its epistemological pot of gold.
</p>

<p>
McLuhan came out of Canada's agricultural soil, his cultural origins quite similar to the passionate socialist agrarianism Thomas Frank lauds in the pre-Republican Kansas of yore, a state we are not in anymore. McLuhan read English at Cambridge with I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis, but a no less profound mentor was G. K. Chesterton; Kenner's first book was <i>Paradox in Chesterton,</i> introduced by McLuhan. McLuhan likened Chesterton's style to a cathedral's stained glass window, "a mosaic of brilliantly clear and simple hues through which, and not upon which, a transring light streams."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The alembic of Cambridge was powerful for McLuhan's thought, but the mediated encounter with the American South he experienced as a professor in St. Louis, Missouri, a former slave state culturally identified with the defeated Confederacy, proves decisive. No longer populist per se, but still true to his agricultural roots and resistant to the colonial metropole, McLuhan finds in the New Agrarians quixotically reconstructing the historical South a fitting template for his cultural critique, one with farmland at its heart.
</p>

<p>
Giving Enlightenment rationalism a wide berth in its European form, the Sophist tradition's dedication to the originary powers of speech blooms for him anew in the antebellum South, and finds its ideal mouthpiece in Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is like Pound, McLuhan will write in a late essay, one who puts a trenchant, practical American spin on Europe's effete rationalism, like the plough Jefferson designed, which McLuhan compares to Pound's technical poetics in the <i>Cantos.</i> Both are poetic machines, inventions not attributable, McLuhan argues, to Europe.
</p>

<p>
In the rationalist North, a literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe, arises from the fallen condition of print and mass culture who can navigate these shoals because he is originally Southern. By McLuhan's lights, Poe descends into the savage forces of print culture, modernity, and the North to seize their power for other, sophistic ends. Poe's medium&#x02014;writing that mimics modern media forms to channel those energies into a wake-up call for deluded, print-addled folk&#x02014;is his message; the message has no meaning save for its clarion tintinnabulation.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  From Poe's "purloined letter" it is but a short jump to high modernism's purloined word, where McLuhan's theory of literature waits for us to notice it on the critical mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
McLuhan credits Pound's <i>Cantos</i> with showing him how to stop making increasingly futile moral judgments of modernity and mass culture, and instead, animated, to enter the fray. Pound enables McLuhan to ride the whirlwind, to channel the beast of print culture gone mad and bad. McLuhan's visit to Pound at St. Elizabeths in 1948, initiating an intense five-year correspondence between them, sparked McLuhan's thought and in its reverberation offered Kenner the fleshly ribbon of Pound needed to tie up the package of Kennerian modernism. McLuhan writes to Pound, echoing in advance the thesis of <i>The Pound Era</i>:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Your Cantos, I now judge, to be the first and only serious use of the great technological possibilities of the cinematograph. Am I right in thinking of them as a montage of personae and sculpted images? Flashbacks providing perceptions of simultaneities?. . . Poe in 1840 or so invented the cinema via Dupin. . . . by cinematic montage he reconstructs the crime, as all sleuths have since done. Are Cantos 1&#x02013;40 such a reconstruction of a crime? Crime against man and civilization?"<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
McLuhan took Kenner to see Pound for a two-hour visit on June 4<sup>th</sup>, 1948. The rest is modernism.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Mechanical Bride</i>  was McLuhan's dynamic, Pound-inspired machine for living in the rose window-cum-maelstrom of modernity. Kenner deployed McLuhan's insights twenty years later in constructing a high modernism stripped bare of explicit McLuhanism, by adopting the same amanuensis for <i>The Pound Era.</i> Where McLuhan veered off the rails in designating Pound as a prophetic Sophist, answer to modernity's woes, Kenner inserted Pound into a more controlled universe of literary modernism, and found his prophet. Pound becomes in Kenner's narrative that rough beast slouching toward London to be born.
</p>

<p>
Early and middle McLuhan lives on in Kenner's magisterial modernism, powerful as ever because in Kenner there is no pressure to totalize the system beyond its capacity for totalization. Circling back to Kenner's discrepant application of early McLuhan's literary theories to Pound paradoxically liberates the madness in McLuhan's method, and its sense. Pound is modernism's medium incarnate, a spirit open to the faintest signals announcing a new <i>techne</i> on the horizon, and more importantly a medium per se, a latter-day Hermes who brings the message of no message. <i>The Pound Era</i> operates like Kenner's revision of <i>The Mechanical Bride</i> in his own key and cadence. The book is a mosaic of modernist chips given heft and ductility by Pound's body of work and his sheer quiditty, his <i>Dasein</i> as the design of modernism's rose window. Paradoxically, McLuhan's swerve toward Aquinas supplied the epistemological basis both critics needed to apprehend modernity's technological and aesthetic complexity. In their elaborated Thomism, their refusal to occlude the body and its sense organs, Kenner and McLuhan become the most prescient moderns. "Mimesis," McLuhan declared, was "not simply a matter of representation," but rather of "putting on a completely new mode of being, whereby all possibility of objectivity and detachment of re from ground is discarded." <i>The Pound Era</i> obliterates re from ground, critic from artist.
</p>

<p>
The Pound Kenner creates as modernism's material body, under the sign of the machine age, partakes profoundly of McLuhan's ultramodernist anti-modernism. The paradox is that Pound had or was an uncanny dousing-rod, able to locate modernity's wellsprings pooling underground, and then capable of bringing them bursting to the surface&#x02014;yet all this intuitive <i>poesis</i> was finally in the service of the old, not the new. Pound recognizes the command to "make it new" as the means of removing modernity's encrustations the better to awaken its sleepers to face in the opposite direction. Pound, a real person whose very name is a weight or measure, abstract and concrete, a verb and a noun, serves as a bridge of flesh over the roiling waters of individualist modernity,

<b></b>

a sturdy American bridge, well-engineered, resolutely disciplined, colloquially eloquent, mainlining American know-how even as it traverses cultures, centuries, and languages with impunity.
</p>

<p>
Pound epitomizes modernism in that modernism under the erasure of Kenner's variant is even at its inception an allegory of its self-negation. <i>The Pound Era</i> is as outrageous and fresh in its construction as was <i>The Mechanical Bride,</i> because Kenner dares to use McLuhan's principle of montage as collage plus time, the dynamization of space, the spatialization of time (Erwin Panofsky's definition of film). Kenner's mosaic text exhibits its non-linear simultaneities by montage that juxtaposes the written and the lived histories of those who made modernism, creating an acoustic space shot through with dialogized time, within which we hear and see flashes of what Pound was doing at a given time, eating chocolate as he hikes with his wife or traveling to Venice as a twelve-year-old. These events are given material heft by a dynamic sense of time that makes an event rhyme with a deeper dynamic of time unfolding in another space and place. Vision is problematic for McLuhan because he holds that in the economy of the senses an emphasis on the eye (as in print culture's reliance on vision) would ultimately destroy the all-important life-world of the ear (the primacy of oral speech and of the Word made flesh). McLuhan's deep collaboration with Siegfried Giedion spills over to his student Kenner as a horror of linear perspective and its reduction to a singular point of view. The fascinating connection here is with Walter Benjamin, whose close friendship with Giedion, once his roommate, unites Benjamin's <i>Arcades</i> project, with its diffusion of perspectives, its collective rather than individual subjectivity, and its emphasis on the memory palace of human spaces, with McLuhan's earlier theories of technology and space-time, and, above all, with Kenner's <i>Pound Era,</i> an arcade of modernity on the page. Kenner shares this antipathy to singular perspectives and to visual dominance, both confuted in <i>The Pound Era</i> by its montage environment, where its many pictures and photographs are mediated through human spaces and voices, a regime of the ear.
</p>

<p>
The superb "Pound Typing" from <i>The Mechanic Muse</i>  distills early McLuhan as modernism's received wisdom; on its face the essay is about the technological medium of the typewriter in Pound's hands. Pound-cum-typewriter is the synecdoche for an unexpressed debt to McLuhan. The book's introduction offers a recursive valedictory to high modernism by memorializing Otto Mergenthaler's linotype machine of 1885. With the associative logic of McLuhan's non-linear history of technology, Kenner groups the birthdates of the high modernists around the linotype's patenting date to validate modernism's technological genealogy. The essay takes Kenner's own high modernism as a relic of the era of "transparent technology," when technology was yoked to the body as prosthesis, rather than part of the invisible "so-called Post-Modern" technology.
</p>

<p>
Kenner's high modernism is an epistemology, not an aesthetic. Kenner writes that "sheer intellection of self-interfering patterns . . . was the guarantor of all values" (<i>TPE,</i> 312). Its formalism does not derive from a purely aesthetic understanding of art's value, nor does it divorce art from the <i>socius.</i> Kenner through McLuhan reveals a modernism whose formalism is materialist, bodily, and communal, a history-filled knowledge. Kenner

<b></b>

writes, quoting McLuhan without attribution: "It is only the people we call savages who have a simple, a purposive, a unified culture: whose poets are 'technicians of the sacred.' The decision to leave those simplicities behind . . . was entailed in our decision not to be savages" (<i>TMM,</i> 131). Kenner's modernism must subscribe, like McLuhan's spatial montage theory, to the dictum that "art does not progress." McLuhan, first, and then Kenner rejects Eliot's formulation of this insight in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" for slighting the supercharging of space that can admit time into itself. Both credit Pound with this materialist, formalist realization. Yet Pound progresses; like that bull moose Teddy Roosevelt whom Kenner was fond of twinning with him, forever associated with progress and the progressive movement he named, he seizes the wheel of Western modernity's Edsel and drives it back deep into the past. His art pushes forward the energies of the human community and its <i>sensus communis,</i> the veritable medium of mediation acting on a fraught landscape in need of Jefferson's plough. What are the implications of Kenner's Pound of flesh for modernism? They are staggering: modernism was always already a post- and an ante- modernism, always already postcolonial, always already deterritorialized, the non-linear end of the book and the beginning of the writing of the body. And perhaps even more startling: high modernism is a farm in Canada.
