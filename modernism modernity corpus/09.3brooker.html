<p>
In early 1920, T. S. Eliot sent his brother Henry a copy of his new book, <i>Ara Vos Prec,</i> just published in a limited edition. These poems, he told his brother, are "intensely serious, . . . among the best I have ever done." But they would not, he feared, be well received, especially by his mother. "I have not sent this to Mother or told her about it. . . . Do you think that 'Sweeney Erect' will shock her?"
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  We do not know what Eliot's mother thought of "Sweeney Erect," but we do know that readers over the years have considered the poems in <i>Ara Vos Prec</i> to be both puzzling and disturbing. Some, perhaps like Eliot's mother, have found them embarrassing; others have agreed with Eliot that they are among his best. But whether or not they are among his best, they are clearly brilliant specimens of modernism in their marriage of experimental form and shocking content.

<p>
The critics who have taken the <i>Ara Vos Prec</i> poems most seriously fall into two categories, emphasizing either impersonal qualities related to form or personal qualities related to content. The former tend to connect these poems to the critical theories Eliot was working through at the same time&#8212;the historical sense, impersonality, tradition&#8212;all elaborated in his 1920 collection, <i>The Sacred Wood</i>. The second strain of criticism, emerging somewhat later, tends to focus on the poems as personal expressions of the poet's alleged prejudices against women and Jews. The older critics are inclined to neglect intersections of art with life, whereas more recent critics often neglect literary elements, such as structural framing, tone, and point of view, that shape meaning.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 



<b></b>

<p>
The interpretation presented in this paper owes something to critics from both camps, but most to William Arrowsmith, whose discussion of the classical backgrounds of the Sweeney poems is superb.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  My thesis is that these poems portray violence and desire as reciprocally and mimetically related and that they emerged largely from the convergence of two powerful elements in Eliot's own life. The first, World War I, was public and impersonal; the other, the poet's marriage in 1915 to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, was private and intensely personal. In the normal course of events, war would be associated with violence and marriage with desire. In wartime London (and Paris and Berlin), however, violence reached into every corner of civilian life, coloring and intensifying all aspects of personal life, including the sexual. In Eliot's case, the result of this convergence can be found in the Sweeney poems, written between 1917 and 1919, during the first few years of his troubled marriage and during or immediately following the war. The war, virtually unnoted in criticism of these poems, is a powerful influence, for it provides the background of violence and desire against which both his personal life and his understanding of culture took shape. Eliot's marriage <i>per se</i> is less important for this essay than the related issue of sexuality and its entanglement in violence. In support of my thesis, I will offer an analysis of "Sweeney Erect," the poem Eliot did not want his mother to see.

<p>
The theoretical backdrop for the following discussion is Ren&eacute; Girard's work on violence and desire. In <i>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i>  and several subsequent books, including <i>Violence and the Sacred</i> , Girard maintains that violence originates in mimetic desire. His basic insight is that what makes an object desirable is related less to its inherent value than to the fact that it is considered desirable by someone else. Desire is not spontaneous and original; it is mediated and copied. One tends to desire what others desire, to value what others value. Desire is thus triangular, with invisible lines connecting a subject, an object, and someone else whose desires are imitated. Girard claims that the mediator is a key to understanding violence and culture. He is perceived by the subject not as a mediator, but as a rival, as someone who desires the same object and thus blocks access to it. This perceived interference feeds on itself and leads to violence. The idea that desire is acquisitive is not new, but the idea that it is mimetic is new and helpful in explaining the mechanism of both violence and desire. In <i>Violence and the Sacred,</i> Girard explores the reciprocity involved in violence, showing how it spreads and accelerates toward a crisis, and finally, how it is checked. He argues that individual violence tends to repeat itself unless it is assuaged by collective violence. Girard's overall thesis is perfectly illustrated by war, which always involves mimetic desire, rivalry, enemy brothers, scapegoats, and collective violence.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 

<p>
The point in Girard's theory that is most relevant to my argument regarding the convergence of violence and desire in the Sweeney poems is the claim that sexuality and violence are closely related in all cultures and religions, and further, that in some instances, they are interchangeable. The connections, in fact, are many and for the most part self-evident:  both sexual excitement and violent aggression are based on mimetic desire;  both trigger almost identical biochemical changes;  both involve 
<b></b>
temporary loss or suspension of rational faculties;  both involve shedding of blood;  once triggered, both tend to accelerate toward explosive bursts of energy;  both tend to take on a life of their own apart from the object;  both tend to accept surrogates if the object of desire is inaccessible;  both are highly contagious; and  both can result in injury or death, as in war or childbirth. Violence and sexuality, he concludes, are mimetically related and separated by the thinnest of lines. "The shift from violence to sexuality, then, and from sexuality to violence is easily effected, even by the most 'normal' of individuals, totally lacking in perversion."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  Girard's notion of desire is consistent with the view of sociologists such as William Simon, who argue that sex is never just about sex, but always includes something happening at an angle offstage and often involves violence.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  The offstage (or off-page) drama of acquisitive violence relevant to the Sweeney poems, I suggest, was the bloody struggle centered just across the English Channel, the effects of which dominated London life for many years, beginning in August 1914.

<p>
The association of sexuality and violence, a signature feature of the Sweeney poems, is evident in Eliot's early poetic notebook, both in the bawdy limericks he shared with his male friends and in the striking inscriptions of religious ecstasy and sexual violence.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  His tendency to connect sexuality and violence was cinched by his marriage in June 1915. From the very beginning, he linked sex with the spilling of blood, an association that can be seen in his little-known honeymoon poem, "Ode."

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When the bridegroom smoothed his hair

<br />
There was blood upon the bed.

<br />
Morning was already late.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

 

<p>
Eliot's bride had a problem with abnormal vaginal bleeding, a condition that he did not discover until after their marriage. Their sheets were often bloody, and understandably, he felt directly implicated. Another reason Eliot would have associated sexuality with violence is that in addition to her "female" trouble, his wife was constantly ill with a nervous condition that at times verged on madness. The association of sexuality with violence, and of both with madness, as Girard points out, is not unusual, especially in creative writers. In fact, it is made repeatedly in the work of two of Eliot's favorite writers, Dostoevsky and Baudelaire. Their work is a reminder of how close sexual activity is to violence and to madness, and of how in the minds of many people, one of the thrills of sex is its proximity to violence. Making love is akin to murder, to doing a girl in, as a later incarnation of Eliot's Sweeney puts it.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 

<p>
The two Sweeney poems&#8212;"Sweeney Erect" and "Sweeney Among the Nightingales"&#8212;were written soon after Eliot's marriage, and both betray profound sexual anxiety. But of equal or greater importance is the fact that they were written in the third and fourth years of the Great War. Sexual violence in these poems is inseparable from a much more comprehensive violence, one seldom mentioned in Eliot studies&#8212;that is, the everyday violence of living in wartime London. A close reading of his letters, correlated with current events, indicates that it was not so much blood on the bed as 
<b></b>
blood all around that impressed Eliot from 1915-18. If Girard's thesis is valid, the two cannot be fully separated. Violence in the public and private arenas are in subtle ways reciprocally and mimetically related. In addition, violence has an indelible effect on intellectual and imaginative life, shaping one's understanding of human nature, forcing reflection on the human propensity to wound and destroy, and shaping one's fantasies (particularly sexual ones).

<p>
The beginning of Eliot's residence in Europe coincides exactly with the beginning of the war. He arrived as a student at the University of Marburg in July 1914; on 1 August, Germany declared war on Russia, and on 4 August, England declared war on Germany. Forced to flee from Germany, he spent the fall of 1914 and the spring of 1915 at Oxford. He was deeply disturbed by the unfolding events and desperately worried about friends on the battlefield, including Jean Verdenal, who was ting on the Western Front. In the spring Verdenal was sent to the Dardanelles, where he was killed in May&#8212;"mixed with the mud of Gallipoli."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  In mid-June of 1915, at the end of Oxford's Trinity Term, Eliot moved to London. One week later, after a courtship lasting less than two months, he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood, and thenceforth, he lived in London. The war had been under way for almost a year, and it had already plunged London into deep crisis.

<p>
First, from 1915 until the end of the war, London with her groaning multitudes was under aerial bombardment. Peter Strasser, the commander of the Zeppelin fleets in charge of bombing London, "was bothered by the moral implications of raids" on civilians, but rationalized that there was no such thing as a noncombatant. Because civilians in London provided the food and the machinery to support the troops, they were deemed a necessary target. "It was all part of total war . . . war on entire populations."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  On the night of 2-3 September 1916, one of the most spectacular episodes of the entire air war occurred over London. Over five hundred bombs were dropped in an arc around London, and a German airship was shot down over the city, its flaming wreckage seen by hundreds of thousands of witnesses (<i>GW,</i> 132). At the time, Eliot and Vivienne were on holiday in Bosham, a fishing village near Portsmouth, but two days later, on 5 September, he returned to London alone to work at the British Museum. That evening, he wrote to his cousin Eleanor Hinkley. He did not mention the attack on London, but concluded by saying, "Remember that this and all letters are read by the censors" (<i>L,</i> 147-8). The next evening, he wrote to his mother and brother, again not mentioning the devastation in London, but confiding in the letter to Henry that "the present year has been . . . the most awful nightmare of anxiety that the mind of man could conceive, but at least it is not dull" (<i>L,</i> 151). Some six months later in March 1917, Peter Strasser's Zeppelin was shot down over London, and he was killed. On 21 March, Eliot wrote to his sister, "the war has at least brought <i>variety</i> into our lives," but that "political topics are barred in letters; . . . a great annoyance to me, as I am violently interested in the subject at present. . . ." (<i>L,</i> 165). In July 1917, in a letter to his cousin Eleanor, Eliot did allow one reference to the bombs to enter his letters. He had been working in Lloyd's Bank since March, and he describes his experience:



<b></b>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have been living in one of Dostoevsky's novels, you see, not in one of Jane Austen's. If I have not seen the battle field, I have seen other strange things, and I have signed a cheque for two hundred thousand pounds while bombs fell all about me. . . . it all seems like a dream. [<i>L,</i> 189]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
To be a character in a novel by Dostoevsky would be to live in a world of violence, terror, perversity, madness, and anxiety, the world of such works as <i>Crime and Punishment</i> or <i>Notes from Underground.</i>

<p>
A second way that the war impacted Londoners can be seen in their relationships with soldiers who were home on leave. Eliot knew many men who returned to London for rest leaves and often refers to his terrifying conversations with them. His most frequent visitor from the Front was Vivienne's young brother Maurice. In November 1915, Maurice came home for a brief rest, part of it spent with Tom and Vivienne. Tom described the visit in a letter to his mother:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Maurice was home for five days leave this week . . . It seems very strange that a boy of nineteen should have such experiences&#8212;often twelve hours alone in his "dug-out" in the trenches, and at night, when he cannot sleep, occupying himself by shooting rats with a revolver. What he tells about rats and vermin is incredible&#8212;Northern France is swarming, and the rats are as big as cats. His "dug-out," where he sleeps, is underground and gets no sunlight. [<i>L,</i> 121]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Maurice is mentioned repeatedly in the wartime letters, with affection and respect. He was invalided at home for insomnia in August 1916 and spent several days at Bosham boating with Tom and Vivienne. Tom wrote to his cousin Eleanor that Maurice

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
looks nearer twenty-five than twenty. He is thoroughly WORN OUT and from some of the horrors which he once entertained us with, I am not surprised. A boy of nineteen (for he had his twentieth birthday with us) who is quite used to the sight of <i>disjecta membra</i> and has spent nights . . . in shooting rats with a revolver, makes me feel comparatively immature. [<i>L,</i> 147]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
These horrific accounts by soldiers unmasked the rosy picture painted by the generals and politicians. In 1917, Eliot wrote to his father: "I see the war partly through the eyes of men who have been and returned, and who view it, even when convinced of the rightness of the cause . . . as something very sordid and disagreeable, which must be lived through" (<i>L,</i> 183).

<p>
1916 was a bleak year for Europe. In January, Eliot wrote Conrad Aiken with the news that Verdenal had been killed, adding, "we are very blue about the war" (<i>L,</i> 125). In February, one of the most gruesome battles in military history began near Verdun. This battle of attrition lasted the rest of the year, with over a million French and German casualties. On 1 July 1916, the equivalent disaster for England commenced with the Battle of the Somme. Over a million men were killed, with 60,000 British casualties on the first day alone, the worst day in British military history. There were over 5,000 London casualties on that first day.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  A documentary of the Battle of the Somme 
<b></b>
was shown in London. It was the first time civilians had actually seen what was happening, and many ran from the theatre screaming (<i>GW,</i> 187-8). Winter and Baggett claim that even today, Britain has not recovered from the first day of the Battle of the Somme. They argue that 1 July 1916 was the "point at which the illusions of one century gave way to the realism of another" (<i>GW,</i> 195).

<p>
The red horse of war is always followed by the pale horse of death. In 1918, an influenza epidemic swept the world, killing over twenty million people, more than twice as many as were killed in the war (<i>GW,</i> 314). Both Eliot and his wife had influenza for most of 1918, and in July, he wrote to his mother, "We have been living on quietly and trying to escape the 'Spanish influenza,' so called. A good many men&#8212;and women&#8212;have been away from the office with that curious malady" (<i>L,</i> 237). By November and December, both Eliots were gravely ill. The war had been going on for four years, and as Tom had indicated to his brother, they were living in a nightmare (<i>L,</i> 172). When Eliot began work on the Sweeney poems, he was at his lowest point&#8212;physically, psychologically, and spiritually.

<p>
To illustrate the convergence of violence and desire in the poems Eliot wrote during the war, I now turn to a reading of "Sweeney Erect," arguably the most disturbing poem in his 1920 collection. It is not immediately clear what is going on in this poem, but it is clear that violence is in the air. There are jackknives, razors, sickles&#8212;all tools designed for legitimate purposes, but also instruments used in torture and murder. And the verbs&#8212;slitted, gashed, cropped&#8212;point to slaughter, rather than shaving or farming. Moreover, the responses&#8212;shrieking, clawing, clutching one's sides&#8212;are consistent with having been attacked or wounded. The ominous mood is underscored and the tension heightened by ambiguity. Is this poem about sex or is it about murder? To consider this question is to enter the labyrinth of reading, or in Gerontion's phrase, a "wilderness of mirrors."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 

<p>
Structurally, "Sweeney Erect" is complex, a palimpsest of cultural and temporal layers. It consists of two parts, each with its own voice, its own scene and characters, and its own tone. The epigraph and first two quatrains project a desperate and presumably female voice beseeching an artist to create a desolate landscape; the remaining nine quatrains present a presumably male voice narrating the story of a man finishing up his business in a whorehouse. The first part is related primarily to the visual arts and tends to be static, while the second is related to narrative and tends to be dynamic; the first part suggests prehistory, while the second suggests contemporary history. The voice in the first part cries out from within her story, appealing to the reader, while the voice in the second belongs to an observer who stands outside the story and comments on it parenthetically in an aside to the reader.

<p>
A first step in understanding the poem is to decode the action of the second part, that part containing the Sweeney narrative, and beginning in the third quatrain. The curtain opens on Sweeney and a prostitute in bed, their feet and hands protruding from beneath the sheets. The morning light wakes them, and Sweeney begins to emerge, his prehensile arms suggestive of an orangutan's. The association of Sweeney with an ape is a clear signal that he is a caricature, the signature of which is the exaggeration of a physical characteristic such as a crooked nose or a squinting eye in order to make a 
<b></b>
point. In this instance, the exaggerated characteristic is human kinship with the lower animals&#8212;more specifically, with the anthropoid ape closest to humans in the evolutionary scale. To understand even the literal meaning of the poem, one must recognize that the characters are caricatures. Sweeney straddles the human and the subhuman, his spiritual qualities obscured and his lower, material qualities accented.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
This withered root of knots of hair

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Slitted below and gashed with eyes,

<br />
This oval O cropped out with teeth:
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
These lines describe, among other things, the face the yawning Sweeney will see when he looks in the mirror: hairy, bestial, his mouth a slit, his eyes gashes. The teeth are a reminder that he is not only carnivorous but cannibalistic, associated in this poem with Polyphemus, the Cyclops who eats Odysseus's sailors, and with the Minotaur, who consumes fourteen young Athenians each year. In a reincarnation of Sweeney a decade later, Eliot will underscore the connection between violence and sexuality by merging cannibalism and sexual desire: "Yes I'd eat you!" Sweeney will say to Doris in <i>Sweeney Agonistes.</i>
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  This sort of caricature, incidently, was rampant during the war. Images of the enemy as orangutans appeared not only on recruiting posters, but in cartoons, commercial advertising, popular culture, and even in sermons (<i>GW,</i> 94).

<p>
Sweeney not only looks like an ape; he acts like one. Some of the most shocking lines in the poem describe him getting out of bed:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The sickle motion from the thighs

<p>
Jackknifes upward at the knees

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then straightens out from heel to hip

<br />
Pushing the framework of the bed

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And clawing at the pillow slip.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
A jackknife is a large pocketknife; in the context of a brutish man visiting a prostitute, it becomes a nightmarish phallic image. Still, though the image casts a long shadow over Sweeney's sexual performance and the pain he is capable of inflicting, the word "jackknife" is here used as a verb to describe his motion in getting up. A "jackknife" is a dive in which the diver bends sharply in midair to touch his toes and then briskly straightens out before entering the water. It also refers to a sit-up, in which the diving maneuver is preceded by a sudden contraction of the knees. This is an energetic way to move from a prone to an erect position, but within the range of normal, especially for athletes or adolescents.

<p>
Sweeney is more complex, however, than the caricature would suggest, for he is an ape who stands erect and looks in a mirror and shaves and generalizes about the female temperament. Looking in the mirror, he sees the human face behind the knots of hair, and he prepares to remove the facial hair that is the mark of the beast. As he wipes the suds about his face, his recumbent friend shrieks, and he pauses&#8212;both to 
<b></b>
allow the shriek to subside and to allow the narrator to toss in an aside for the reader&#8212;and then he tests the razor on his leg, at which point the prostitute curves backward and clutches her sides. She is as much a caricature as is Sweeney. Her response to Sweeney's antics is described ambiguously as a shriek, her convulsive behavior as an epileptic fit. Where is the poem's sympathy in this episode; with Sweeney, as some critics assume, or with the prostitute? It is difficult, in fact, to sympathize with either, for any sympathy that might be elicited by the situation is neutralized by the technique. Caricature defeats sympathy; indeed that is one of the main reasons for using it.

<p>
The cause of the shriek (amusement? pain? anger? illness?) is ambiguous, but the result is clear&#8212;it disturbs the other women in the house. In the two quatrains describing their response to the ruckus, Eliot moves from caricature to irony. One might think that women in this profession were beyond blushing, but no, these are "ladies," they have their principles, and they are fearful lest Sweeney's behavior reflect on them. Doris's hysteria, after all, might be misinterpreted by other customers. Mrs. Turner, the madam, agrees that such behavior "does the house no sort of good." Meanwhile, Doris seems to have composed herself and taken a bath; she returns wrapped only in a towel, bringing liquid refreshment.

<p>
The Sweeney narrative assaults the reader with the fact of violence in a context that links it to sexuality. What are the roots of such violence, and how are they related to gender? Important clues are given in three allusions. The first two are to American classics, Emerson's "Self-Reliance" and Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue," and the third is to Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis.</i> Altogether, these allusions provide a commentary on violence and human nature in the context of evolution. The Emerson allusion is arguably the most important. Eliot re-read Emerson in 1916 and 1917 for his adult education course, writing to his mother in early 1917 that he was immersed in Emerson (<i>EDA,</i> 41; <i>L,</i> 196). Beginning work on the Sweeney poems at the same time, he found his fellow American's ideas useful as a reference point for commenting on human nature as he was getting to know it in his marriage and in war-ravaged London.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The most explicit use of Emerson appears in "Sweeney Erect."

<p>
Roughly in the middle of the Sweeney plot, the narrator interrupts his story to comment parenthetically on Emerson's philosophy of history. He refers to the American sage by name and loosely quotes from his most famous essay, "Self-Reliance."

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
(The lengthened shadow of a man

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is history, said Emerson

<br />
Who had not seen the silhouette

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of Sweeney straddled in the sun.)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Emerson believed in moral evolution. People, he argued, were not only becoming stronger; they were becoming better. He maintained that individuals could make a difference in their own evolution. If they were slothful, they would slide backward toward the beasts; if they were self-reliant and energetic, they would move upward toward the angels. The quintessential American optimist, Emerson believed that one could make oneself into an exceptional individual, someone who could shape history. 
<b></b>
He defined history, in fact, as little more than the cumulative record of the works of superior individuals:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; . . . A Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so . . . cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possibility of man. . . . An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; . . . all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Emerson concludes this famous essay by saying that only the self-reliant individual truly "stands in the erect position."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Eliot's paraphrase condenses but does not misrepresent Emerson's view. "Sweeney Erect" is above all an ironic commentary on Emerson's view of human nature and history. In 1917, three years into a seemingly never-ending war, the belief in man's innate nobility can only be described as touchingly naive. The contrast between Emerson and Eliot can be seen in their respective uses of the adjective "erect" to describe human beings. Emerson's pun points to those qualities that differentiate the human from the subhuman. Being <i>homo erectus,</i> standing in the "erect position," means being spiritually strong, morally straight. Eliot's pun, conversely, points not to what differentiates man from the orangutan, but to what binds him to the apes&#8212;sexual aggression and a propensity towards violence. Similarly, Eliot's poem subverts the great man theory of history. As he endured the nightmare of life in a bombarded city, Eliot came to see history as the lengthened shadow, not of Caesar or Christ, but of Sweeney. "At the bottom of man's heart there is always the beast," he remarked in a 1916 review.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 

<p>
In "Sweeney Erect" the Emersonian understanding of human nature and history is subverted by two allusions that give a more realistic assessment of the roots of violence. The most striking detail in Eliot's poem, the image of an orangutan shaving before a mirror, is taken from Edgar Allan Poe's justly celebrated "Murders in the Rue Morgue." In this story, a French sailor captures an orangutan in the jungles of Borneo, brings it home to Paris, and hides it in his wardrobe. One evening the sailor comes home and discovers that the orangutan has escaped. He finds it standing straight up before the mirror, razor in hand, trying to shave. Seeing the ape holding a dangerous implement, the sailor reaches for the whip. The terrified beast leaps out of the room and enters the apartment of an old woman and her daughter. The women shriek with horror, and the ape grabs the old woman by the hair with such force that he yanks off part of her scalp, after which he decapitates her with the razor and tosses her out the window. He then kills the daughter, stuffs her up a chimney, and runs away.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 

<p>
This story, like many of Poe's supernatural tales, draws on the most primitive memories of the human psyche. He is dealing, of course, with suppressed violence, with the beast concealed in the center of civilization. And he is dealing with the nature of violence&#8212;its explosive power, especially when it has been suppressed; its tendency to accelerate once it has been triggered; its willingness to accept substitutes if it cannot turn on its true object (in this case, its willingness to attack the defenseless women, instead of the sailor armed with the whip); its unwillingness to stop until it has been 
<b></b>
appeased. Poe is also dealing with the connection between violence and mimetic desire (the ape's desires are imitations of the sailor's), and with the role of fear in triggering violence. It is a shocking story, for many reasons, but as Arrowsmith has remarked, what gives the story its effect of moral shock is the single detail that the orangutan is shaving when his murderous rampage is triggered: "The moral element lies in that ambivalent razor, at once an implement of civilizing adornment and of murder" ("PP," 28-9). By forcing our attention on the image of the orangutan shaving, and having the ape pause and then reverse directions, Poe presents a snapshot of man on the very cusp of evolution, teetering between his capacity for violence and his capacity to prepare a face to meet the faces that he meets. The shaving orangutan seems to be attempting to evolve upward, to become human, to become erect in the anthropological sense. When surprised by the sailor, the ape is studying his own face in the mirror; he is, in brief, becoming self-conscious. In this snapshot, the orangutan, like the far more attractive Lord Jim, can be seen as "one of us."

<p>
In "Sweeney Erect," the hero is superimposed on Poe's orangutan. Sweeney too has a razor and an undoubted capacity for violence, but he also has a capacity for restraint. Both like and unlike Poe's orangutan, Sweeney is a <i>homo duplex</i>&#8212;capable of violence and of culture, of spiraling downward or stretching upward. Seeing his own face in the mirror, he becomes not only self-conscious, but conscious of being human. Shaving off his facial hair, he shows a capacity for transcending his bestiality. Using soap, he demonstrates the ability to cleanse himself.

<p>
The allusion to "Murders in the Rue Morgue" is paralleled by a fascinating allusion to Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis.</i> In the third quatrain of "Sweeney Erect," Eliot compares his hero to Polyphemus. The Cyclops is best known, of course, from the <i>Odyssey,</i> but as Arrowsmith has pointed out, that is not Eliot's main referent here ("PP," 36-7). His Polyphemus comes from Ovid's story of Galatea. This tale, known to English students through its use in pastorals such as Marlowe's "Come live with me and be my love," tells of the sea-nymph Galatea, beloved of a shepherd, whom she loves in return, but also beloved of Polyphemus, whom she hates. In the following lines, Galatea tells how "love" has transformed the Cyclops, causing him to look at his reflection in a pool and shave off his facial hair.

<p>

The issues of self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-love present in so many mirror scenes are clearly present here. This Cyclops with razor and mirror is another of Sweeney's avatars, another murderous beast on the cusp of evolution.

<p>
The allusions to Poe and Ovid point to textbook examples of Girard's theory of mimetic desire accelerating toward violence and also to his idea that sexuality and violence are interrelated. In Poe, the violence is horrendous, and the victims are women. This confluence insures that the tapestry before which his narrative develops will have threads connecting sexuality and violence. In the narrative itself, however, the women are accidental victims. The primary object of the ape's rampage is the sailor, but the sailor has a whip, and so the ape discharges his rage on surrogates. The woman are targets of opportunity, chosen because they are physically weak and have no weapons with which to counterattack. In Poe, the orangutan seems to represent a secret sharer, a capacity for murder residual in <i>homo erectus,</i> male and female. The root of violence in Ovid, similarly, appears to be related primarily to mimetic desire and the state of nature. In Ovid, charmingly, and in Eliot, ominously, violence is connected to metamorphosis. In both Ovid and Eliot, the metamorphosis involves the line separating nature from culture, the bestial from the human.

<p>
Eliot's Sweeney is the lengthened shadow of his avatars, especially of Ovid's Polyphemus and Poe's orangutan. At the same time, he is more complicated than either. If Emerson describes <i>homo erectus,</i> and Poe and Ovid present <i>homo duplex,</i> then Eliot creates <i>homo multiplex.</i> His narrative is labyrinthine, with alternative readings jostling for attention. These alternative readings are clearly intentional; indeed the bedrock ambiguity is part of the meaning. The alternatives support the conviction, evident in all layers of the poem, that humans, both as a species and as individuals, are on a pivot point between a downward spiral into violence and an upward step into culture.

<p>
The ambiguities begin with the title itself. The pun on "erect"&#8212;Sweeney's status as human, as <i>homo erectus,</i> and also his sexual erection&#8212;suggests the tension between intellect and instinct that for Eliot is distinctive of the human. The issue is complicated by the fact that instinct is associated not only with brutality, but also with sexuality and the life force. In fact, Sweeney's erection is a visual reminder of well-known statues of Greek fertility res with oversized fully erect phalluses, res at once frightening and life-affirming. Intellect, similarly, is darkly ambiguous. It not only points toward progress, but toward violence. The unprecedented violence of Verdun and the Somme, after all, originated in "Ideas" and was managed by the intellectual elite&#8212;in other words, by politicians and generals.

<p>
The ambiguity of the title is multiplied in the narrative, as will be evident to anyone familiar with the poem's criticism. Lyndall Gordon, for example, suggests quite a different narrative from the one outlined earlier in this essay. While I suggest that the quatrain beginning with "This withered root of knots of hair" describes the face Sweeney must confront in the mirror, Gordon reads this quatrain as a description of the woman in bed with Sweeney. "A prostitute is reduced to a set of slits&#8212;'Slitted below and gashed with eyes'"(<i>IL,</i> 105). I agree that the ambiguous description could apply to the 
<b></b>
prostitute, and even concede that it is suggestive not only of a face but of female genitalia, but I don't agree that the image applies exclusively or primarily to the prostitute. The focus is on Sweeney, which suggests minimally that the description be tested on him first; when so tested, it not only fits, but clearly anticipates his interest in shaving. Ignoring Sweeney here is ignoring the point of view. The more general point is crucial: Eliot routinely uses language that allows (almost forces) a spillover effect; in this case, he describes Sweeney's face in language that cannot help but spill over to the prostitute. The difference in this reading and Gordon's has consequences, for it is her claim that the description refers to the prostitute that enables her to see this quatrain as evidence of "the poet's hatred of women's sexuality" (ibid). The alternative reading&#8212;that the narrator is describing both Sweeney and the woman on the bed&#8212;allows for greater complexity in that it takes into consideration the nature of men and women individually and in relation to each other, both socially and sexually.

<p>
Similarly, what I read as a representation of Sweeney getting up, Gordon reads as a representation of him having sex. "The 'sickle motion of the thighs'&#8212;all there is to sex&#8212;turns into the alarming jerk of an epileptic fit" (ibid). She is not pulling this out of a hat, of course, for the text allows this interpretation by superimposing a jackknife sit-up on both sex and an epileptic fit. But again I would argue that the primary and most literally coherent reading is of a man getting up, with spillover readings suggesting sexual intercourse and epilepsy. If the passage is primarily a description of sex, then the woman is being tortured. If it is a representation of a jackknife sit-up, with clear pointers toward a brutal sexual performance, then the subject changes from what Sweeney <i>is doing</i> to the prostitute to what he <i>is capable of doing,</i> and by extension, to what human beings are capable of doing to each other.

<p>
I would also take issue with Gordon's idea that Sweeney is Eliot's surrogate in any narrow sense. Sweeney is a symbol, an idea, an image of man as he has evolved. Eliot is also a man, and thus it goes without saying that Eliot is Sweeney. But the reader is also Sweeney. "<i>Hypocrite lecteur!&#8212;Mon semblable,&#8212;mon fr&egrave;re</i>!"
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The poem is not to any appreciable extent self-portraiture or even self-caricature; it is an analysis of violence and human nature that exploits ambiguity to the hilt, choosing language so excessive that it cannot possibly be contained within ordinary boundaries. By building several alternative readings into the text, Eliot relativizes and ironizes all of them, forcing the reader to explore human nature and its capacity for violence.

<p>
One other clearly intentional ambiguity should be noted. The prostitute is referred to as the "epileptic on the bed," leading many critics to conclude that she is an epileptic and that the ruckus on the bed is a postcoital epileptic fit. This is clearly a valid reading, but not the only one to consider. The other prostitutes diagnose the woman's problem as hysteria, and their diagnosis is literally coherent. But why, then, is she called "the epileptic" on the bed? And why do her actions (shrieking, clutching her sides, curving backwards) correspond to those of someone having an epileptic fit? From classical times, the resemblance between a sexual orgasm and an epileptic fit has been noticed and feared, and over centuries and across cultures, orgasm has been referred to in crude jokes as an epileptic fit. The saying&#8212;"Coitus is a slight epileptic 
<b></b>
attack"&#8212;is very old indeed, and has been attributed to both Hippocrates and Democritus.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  Epilepsy was commonly known as "falling sickness," not just because of the fact that epileptics fall down, but because the disease was considered to have been caused by sin. But epilepsy was also known as "the sacred disease," associated since classical times with possession by an unknown god ("PP," 52). In "Sweeney Erect," references to uncontrollable bodily violence, sexual orgasm, sin, and mystical union are clustered in a systematic way. One of many effects is that violence and sexuality are placed at a pivot point between the physical and the spiritual, disease and mysticism, falling and rising, loss of self-consciousness through sexual intercourse and loss of self-consciousness through union with the divine.

<p>
With the Sweeney narrative in mind, one can more easily understand the epigraph and first two stanzas of "Sweeney Erect." They introduce and contextualize the contemporary tale by preparing a symbolic landscape for it. There are two basic allusions here, and both show the effects of violence on women and on the earth. The first allusion deals with Aspatia, a character in <i>The Maid's Tragedy</i> by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. The second, embedded in the first, deals with Ariadne, who gave Theseus the ball of thread enabling him to escape from the Minotaur.

<p>
The epigraph quotes a few lines from <i>The Maid's Tragedy</i> (II.ii.81-84), a play that Eliot was probably discussing with students and that was included on the syllabus of his extension course in 1918 (<i>EDA,</i> 481). The maid in question is Aspatia, and her tragedy is that she has been abandoned by her lover Armintor. She speaks the lines quoted in Eliot's epigraph to her female servants, who are working on a tapestry showing Ariadne abandoned on the rocky island of Naxos. Aspatia tells her wenches that their tapestry does not do justice to Ariadne's plight. Since Aspatia herself has just been betrayed, she suggests that they start over, using her as a model for the "lost Ariadne" and creating a landscape which shall "tell" of her desolation.




<blockquote>

<p>
Doe it againe, by me the lost Aspatia,


<br />. . .

<br />
And thinke I stand upon the sea beach now,

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

. . . and let all about me

<br />

<br />. . . strive to make me looke

<br />

<br />
Make all a desolation, looke, looke wenches . . .

</blockquote>

<p>
Aspatia maintains that the appropriate symbol for an abandoned woman is a waste land&#8212;rocky, dry, leafless, and fruitless. In the first two quatrains, Eliot extends Aspatia's lament and augments her instructions for creating such a landscape&#8212;one that will "tell" of Ariadne, standing on the rocky shore, watching her lover sail away.



<b></b>

<p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Display me Aeolus above

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swell with haste the perjured sails.

</blockquote>

<p>
Ariadne, whose story Eliot takes from Catullus 64 and from Ovid's <i>Heroides</i> 10, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete, best known for building the Labyrinth to house the Minotaur. Each year, he forced the King of Athens to give him as tribute seven young boys and seven young girls. The young Athenians were put in the Labyrinth with the monster, and once in, could not find their way out and were eaten alive. Theseus, Prince of Athens, thought that he could outwit the Minotaur, and so volunteered to be one of the young men to enter the Labyrinth. He would have met the same fate as his predecessors, but that the princess Ariadne had given him a ball of string with which to retrace his steps to the entrance. In gratitude, Theseus promised to marry her, but deserted her upon their reaching the stony island of Naxos. In one version, she hanged herself; in another, she was rescued by Dionysus.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 

<p>
These allusions introduce the gender issue in terms less equivocal than those of the Sweeney narrative. In both the Renaissance play and the Greek myth, there is a genuine "maid's tragedy." In both tales, the male is a villain and without excuse, and the female a victim and entirely innocent. He is the actor, and she the one who suffers. And in both cases, the appropriate symbol for her desolation is a ruined land. In the opening stanzas of "Sweeney Erect," Aspatia speaks from within the text, beseeching the reader to look at her as an example of desolation and to imagine a landscape that will reveal that the feminine has been violated. Her voice is not ironized, and thus, like Ariadne in the myth, she elicits sympathy for herself and scorn for her betrayer. Having prepared this stage, Eliot brings in Sweeney and a prostitute. Simply placing these characters against this backdrop deeply ironizes the poem. The hysterical woman on the bed is a ruined woman, but she is no "wronged Aspatia." In this "maid's tragedy," she and her gentleman caller are birds of a feather, the main difference being that he is capable of greater harm because he is physically stronger. In the allusions, the desolation of the woman is "told" by the desolation of the landscape, and in this poem, the desolation of the land can be told from the condition of the epileptic on the bed. As he will in <i>The Waste Land,</i> Eliot here suggests the closest connection between violence and violation of the feminine. In the modern tragedy, the "maid" is more than a maid and more than a symbol of women; she is the feminine principle twisted by hatred and violence. This can be seen in individual relations by the brutal Sweeney and the defeminized Doris, and on the international level, by the devastation of the earth on the Western Front. It is difficult, in fact, to imagine more vicious assaults on the feminine than those commenced at Verdun in February 1916 and on the Somme on 1 July 1916.


<b></b>
<p>


Eliot structures this poem to create a palimpsest of mostly female characters who face monsters in labyrinthine situations. The women include Ariadne and Aspatia, the prostitute and the "ladies of the house." All of them can be imagined as standing with tangled hair on the shore, all weeping with Ariadne among the "bold anfractuous rocks." "Anfractuous" means tortuous or twisting, and full of unexpected turns. Although it is an odd word to use to describe rocks, it does serve, as Arrowsmith points out, to connect the rocks of Naxos with the Labyrinth of Crete ("PP," 55). Like the young Athenian maidens in the Labyrinth, Ariadne is left to die in the passageways of the desolate island surrounded by snarling seas. The monster who destroys her is not the Minotaur, but the man who brings her there and abandons her. In "Sweeney Erect," the prostitute also faces an insensitive and brutal beast in a house of corridors; she is not, however, simply a victim of rape. Unlike "lost Ariadne" and "wrong'd Aspatia," she is implicated in her desolation. The strange complicity of predator and prey is explored with even greater complexity in "Gerontion," written about a year after "Sweeney Erect." In that poem, history is described as a giant whore, but also as a labyrinth with many cunning corridors. History herself is the ruined maid, the abused and abusing feminine, whose labyrinthine womb supplies men for the labyrinthine tombs of northern France and Gallipoli.

<p>
The powerful representation of the confluence of sexuality and violence in Eliot's poems of 1917-19 should be understood in the context of the Great War and its effect on English and European life. The Sweeney poems in particular suggest the entanglement of sexuality and violence in nature and in culture. These poems present a snapshot of humankind on the thin line between the bestial and the fully human, and suggest the complex but fragile situation of human beings in the modern world. Like his avatars, Sweeney carries a "razor" which can be used for shaving or for murder, for adorning the self or destroying the other. This picture of human nature is inseparable from Eliot's personal attempt to understand his own moment in history&#8212;not in the abstract, but in the bedroom of his flat, in his office at Lloyd's Bank, in shell-shocked London, and as reported from the valley of the Somme. The labyrinth in his work is moral, political, sexual, and finally, it is hermeneutical. To read, Eliot suggests, is to enter the labyrinth; to encounter language is to face the minotaur of interpretation.
