<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Debate about the nature and significance of the historical avant-garde
has reached an almost feverish pitch in the last decade, its intensity
clearly a sign that more is at stake than academic questions of historical
accuracy or comprehensiveness. Like an antique mirror from which the
mercury has seeped and faded, the avant-garde has become the ambiguous
glass in which we seem to scrutinize a perplexing image of ourselves,
an image that is haunting precisely because it is simultaneously so
alike and unlike, because it bears so many of the features by which
we recognize ourselves and the contemporary cultural milieu, even as
it also evokes a world that is already feathered at the edges, has
already receded irretrievably into the past, is already remote. While
it would be impossible to catalogue all the salient features that have
been held to define the avant-garde or its significance for today, two
questions have gradually acquired especial importance in the course
of recent critical discussion: one, the extent to which, to use Peter
B&uuml;rger's formulation, the avant-garde "can be defined as an attack
on the status of art in bourgeois society," or as B&uuml;rger further
clarifies, an assault on "art as an institution that is unassociated
with the life praxis of men";
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 and the other, the ways in which that attack overlaps with the
 avant-garde's use of motifs, materials, and artifacts from mass or
 popular culture, a usage that has been dismissed by Marxist critics as
 "a colonization of other, formerly independent" cultural practices,
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 or defended by others for its "subvert[ing]...the hierarchical
 distinctions between high art and mass culture," or for its proposing a
 "critique, not only of

<B></B>

prevailing market conditions, but also of the futility of the Symbolist
[or high-art] response to these conditions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These views may sound either glib or unduly dogmatic in their bold
assertiveness: and while partly that results from disembedding quotations
from their context, partly it reflects the growing polarization, the
increasingly schematic formulations that have characterized recent
discussion about the historical avant-garde. Yet such well-defined
dichotomies prove strangely inadequate when tested against the complex
social realities informing the interaction among avant-garde, elite
bourgeois, and popular cultures in the formative moments of modernism
and the avant-garde, an interaction that might be traced in many cultural
exchanges of the period, but perhaps nowhere better than in the dialogue
of actions that took place between Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Ezra
Pound during the period 1912 to 1914. Marinetti, after all, is typically
viewed as one of the founding fathers of the historical avant-garde, his
creation of Futurism in 1909 considered one of its paradigmatic moments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Pound too is widely treated as a representative of the avant-garde,
 sometimes in contrast to Eliot with his more symbolist or modernist
 style, sometimes by virtue of his role in the formation of first
 Imagism, then Vorticism, the two movements in the Anglo-American literary
 tradition which that nearly resemble the Continental avant-gardes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the most part, however, critics have paired Marinetti with Pound
only in order to dismiss the importance of the connection, and in doing
so they have largely been following a script that originated with Pound
himself. Writing anonymously in 1917, T. S. Eliot had already set a
precedent followed by subsequent critics when he characterized Pound's
relationship to Futurism as one of implacable but informed opposition:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Pound has perhaps done more than anyone to keep Futurism out of
England. His antagonism to this movement was the first which was due not
merely to unintelligent dislike for anything that was new, and was due
to his perception that Futurism was incompatible with any principles of
form. In his own words, Futurism is "accelerated impressionism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot, in these remarks, was not rehearsing a history that he had
witnessed first-hand, given that he had arrived in England more than two
months after Marinetti's final visit in June of 1914, and it is more than
likely that these comments were dictated or suggested to him by Pound.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet Eliot's assessment--or more accurately, Pound's own--has been
 repeated at face value again and again. "Pound was never a Futurist,"
 writes Noel Stock, the appointed biographer of Pound, and he remained
 "indifferent or opposed to most of their principles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Pound, states James Wilhelm, "was strongly opposed...to the
 gimmick-ridden futurists with their odes to automobiles and desire to
 sweep away all existing art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Both scholars, it is true, concede that Futurism may have stimulated
 Pound's thinking, but only insofar as it coincided with a general climate
 of "artistic rebellion" (Wilhelm) that was "[already] 'in the air,'"

<B></B>

(Stock), or only insofar as Futurism may have led Pound to think:
"...something saner might succeed" (Wilhelm). Such remarks bespeak a
puzzling wish to dismiss the possibility that Marinetti may have played
a role in Pound's development, a wish so fervent that it has transformed
itself into fact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Consider the standard edition of Pound's <I>Selected Letters</I>,
 first published in 1950, a volume that includes two letters in which
 Pound explicitly refers to Marinetti by name, both from 1915; in
 their published versions, however, the first is presented without the
 sentence that mentions Marinetti, while the second is given with the name
 "Marinetti" disred into "Mennetti."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If it is true, as the logic of post-structuralism asserts, that every
erasure will leave its trace in such a way that the very thing one is
trying to exclude is disclosed as the hidden center of a contaminated
order, then it will come as no surprise to suggest that Marinetti, far
from merely prompting Pound to issue or encourage hostile remarks about
Futurism, may have stood behind two of the most significant turning points
in Pound's career. In the course of its activities in London during the
period 1912 to 1914, Futurism gradually mounted a sustained interrogation
of the concept of aesthetic autonomy, blurring the boundaries of a
category formerly deemed to be self-evident, precipitating a species of
legitimation crisis in the concept of art itself. Yet this crisis was
not purely or solely conceptual in nature, but derived its special power
from the ways in which Marinetti's activities elided and confused the
distinctions separating different spheres of cultural production--most
important, those associated with art and those with the production of
entertainment as a commodity. The effect of Futurism on Pound and the
London avant-garde was to make the social space of cultural production
into an urgent question, to problematize the settings in which the
work--the business, if you will--of modernism and the avant-garde might
get done. It was no longer the polite salon or the genteel review, it
seemed for a moment, but the concert hall, the mass-circulation newspaper,
or perhaps the music-hall that might serve as the new agora of literary
and cultural debate. But only for a moment. For the efforts to address
the new challenges raised by Marinetti also proved to be failures:
paradoxically, in other words, the twin turning points in the career of
Pound and the London avant-garde were significant not because they led
to the resolution of an intractable problem, but because they revealed
themselves as dead ends--and dead ends not just for Pound's poetic or
intellectual development, but for the avant-garde as a viable cultural
institution. It was when this was finally understood that the avant-garde
turned elsewhere: turned, that is to say, to a third alternative in which
the opposition between elite and popular culture, or between art and
commodity, could be resolved in a brief but uneasy synthesis--resolved,
one might almost say, by the creation of the avant-garde itself; or
resolved in such a way that we, who live on the other side of that
dramatic moment, have inherited a conceptual and institutional impasse
that will probably remain unresolved for quite some time to come.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Marinetti's activities in London prior to World War I have been
poorly chronicled, they can be reconstructed in considerable detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 What emerges is a portrait of some complexity, one that shows an
 ongoing dialogue between Marinetti's evolution and a rapidly changing
 intellectual and social milieu. Marinetti visited and lectured in London
 at four distinct moments. The first was in 1910, when he delivered
 several lectures to the Lyceum Club for Women, then located at 128
 Piccadilly. Pound, however, was away from London when these took place,
 and the little attention that they received makes it unlikely that he
 heard about them upon his return.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The second and more important of Marinetti's visits to England occurred
 in the spring of 1912, when he appeared in conjunction with the first
 exhibition of Futurist paintings at the Sackville Gallery, located at
 28 Sackville Street and owned by Max Rothschild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Even before the show opened on 1 March, it was attracting media attention
 prompted by reports about the controversy it had provoked during its run
 in Paris. Most of the coverage came from mass circulation newspapers,
 dailies and weeklies--<I>The Daily Mirror</I> (7 February), <I>The
 Sketch</I> (14 February), and <I>The Illustrated London News</I>
 (17 February).
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 On the day before the opening of the exhibition, Sir Philip Burne-Jones
 offered his view of Futurism in an interview that appeared in the
 <I>Pall Mall Gazette</I>, and his comments anticipated the terms of
 subsequent debate. Burne-Jones termed the exhibition "something hideous
 and incompetent" and dubbed the Futurists "a band of maniacs."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But when challenged to defend his assertions a few days later by Max
 Rothschild, Burne-Jones retracted his specific comments about individual
 works and formal practices, only to reassert a more fundamental
 critique. He should not have commented on the exhibition at all, he said
 now: it wasn't "really worthwhile discussing the matter seriously"
 because "we are not dealing with Art in any form." The Futurist
 paintings, he summarized, were "outside the pale of Art altogether."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 This was the question that Futurism would press to its ultimate
 consequence: where was the pale, the boundaryline, of Art?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The stage for a confrontation had been set, and when the show opened
the next day it set off an avalanche of newspaper reviews, commentary,
and publicity. In part the exhibition attracted so much and such intense
discussion because it coincided with a deepening political crisis. On the
day that it opened, more than one million miners led by self-declared
syndicalists declared a strike that seemed to threaten vital natural
resources in an unprecedented way. Newspapers called the day "Black
Friday," suggesting a religious cataclysm, and printed cartoons such
as one that portrays a massive Satanic re with hairy arms, cloven
hooves, and the word STRIKE written across his emaciated chest, who
strides across a coalyard and infuses the spirit of chaos among a crowd
of tiny humans fleeing in fright. The title above reads "BLACK FRIDAY,
1912," while below is a second title, "THE MASQUE OF ANARCHY," a reference
to the unions' anarchist-syndicalist leaders.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Simultaneously, militant suffragists suddenly intensified their
 window-breaking campaign, an activity that left contemporaries profoundly
 shocked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 By a kind of metonymy facilitated by the modern newspaper's juxtaposition
 of disparate events, Futurism was becoming

<B></B>

the cipher of a contemporary crisis, and it was in this tense environment
that Marinetti himself arrived, ready to give his lecture of 19 March
at Bechstein Hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Ironically, it would mark a turning point in the career not of Marinetti,
 but of Ezra Pound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By a curious coincidence, Ezra Pound was also giving a lecture on 19
March 1912, the second in a series of three. The talk that he planned
for that day was one that encapsulated the central motifs of his
career to that point. From the moment when he had arrived in London
in late 1908, Pound had welded his claims to literary authority with
the poetry and culture of Provence. The first poem he had published in
England had been a sestina, a verse form from Provence, that depicted the
Proven&ccedil;al poet Bertrans de Born, while his first books of poetry
(<I>Personae, Exultations</I>, and <I>Canzoni</I>) had offered readers
a steady diet of sestinas, albas, planhs, ballatas, madrigales, and
tenzoni. His first work of critical prose had treated the same subject,
the poetry of Provence. Pound had established his earliest literary
identity by offering readers a species of erudite exoticism, recondite
material updated with pungent <I>obiter dicta</I>, a learned mode of
writing that could appeal only to an upper-middle-class audience with
significant cultural capital (to use Bourdieu's term) and ambitious
cultural aspirations. As one approving reviewer of <I>Canzoni</I> put
it, Pound had become "The Modern Troubadour."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 It was a telling oxymoron: Pound had become a living archaism. For
 just as the sestina and the canzone were literary genres linked with a
 distinctly courtly lifestyle, so the troubadour presupposed an aulic mode
 of cultural production--something poles apart from the late industrial
 society in which Pound actually lived.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet if Pound could be accurately described as a form of living archaism,
perhaps it was because he was living archaically. Though Pound had
generally received warm reviews of his early verse, he had also soon
learned that his writings could scarcely earn a sufficient income. Indeed,
he would not have been able to survive had it not been for the stroke
of good fortune that befell him in March 1910, when he was introduced
to Margaret Cravens, a thirty-year-old American expatriate bohemian--a
member of the aristocracy of sensibility, in other words--studying music
in Paris and a friend of the pianist Walter Morse Rummel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Two days after they met, Cravens offered to become his patron. The
 evidence suggests that he received about $1,000, or &#163;200 per
 annum, a sum that was neither mean nor quite princely. On the eve of
 World War I in England, the average wage for the adult male industrial
 worker was about &#163;75 per annum, whereas the average annual income
 of the salaried class was &#163;340. The gap between these res
 represented the divide between the working class and the whole of the
 rest of society, a great and accepted gulf that one historian has termed
 "the major social fact of the day."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Patronage meant that Pound's tent was pitched just on the other side
 of that gulf, yet never far from the abyss that yawned behind him. On
 12 March 1912--one week before Marinetti's lecture, and his own--Pound
 reported to his prospective father-in-law that his income from his
 writings had risen to &#163;38 for four months, a re that would
 yield &#163;114 per annum;

<B></B>

in addition, he had recently secured a contract with a publishing firm
that guaranteed him another &#163;100 per annum. Together with his
&#163;200 from Cravens, he noted proudly, his income amounted to "about
&#163;400 per year, with reasonable chance of increase." To be sure,
"this would not go very far in England," but at least he was approaching
the promised land of the salaried class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in this context that we can best understand Pound's plans to
lecture in March 1912, for these were plainly conceived in order to
supplement his income. The strategy was clear enough: by presenting a
series of lectures with limited admission and relatively high prices per
ticket, one could maximize the returns from the small audience for poetry,
capitalizing on its appeal as a marker of social distinction. The series
would comprise three lectures, each at 10s. 6d., or the whole series
at &#163;1 1s. With the hall or salon furnished by a well-to-do friend,
there were no expenses to cover, and if the house was full, even with the
audience limited to fifty people, Pound would earn between &#163;50 and
&#163;60. The site for the series was the "private gallery" of Lord and
Lady Glenconner, located at 34 Queen Anne's Gate, a sedate residential
street in one of the choicest locations in London, parallel to the
southwestern edge of Saint James' Park. Then, as now, the street was a
museum of eighteenth-century architecture: its houses, all built around
1704, were handsome three-story buildings with brick fronts and interiors
that retained many of their original furnishings--oak staircases, carved
wood panelling with pediments over doorways, marble fireplaces, and so
on. The nearby residents were no less choice, with Lady Assheton-Smith
the owner and occupant of no. 30, and Dowager Lady Allendale residing
next door at no. 32.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="1" HREF="1.3rainey02_1.html">
<IMG

ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/1.3rainey02_1b.gif"></A>

Admission to Pound's lectures was almost as difficult to obtain as a
house on Queen Anne's Gate, and care was taken to distinguish it from
other offerings of the contemporary economy. The program announcing
the lectures, for example, was privately distributed. Tickets were not
commodities that could be purchased, but favors that might be courteously
requested. "TICKETS may be obtained on application to Lady Low," stated
the program. Lady Ann Penelope Low, the daughter of General Robert Percy
Douglas, 4th baronet, had been widowed in 1905 and now resided at 23
De Vere Gardens amid a row of houses nestled just off the southern
corner of Kensington Gardens, where she kept an informal salon and
sponsored "evenings at home." A close friend of Olivia Shakespear,
the mother of Pound's fianc&eacute;e, Lady Low frequented a circle of
upper-middle-class intellectuals such as G. W. Prothero, editor of <I>The
Quarterly Review</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Here was the realm of elite bourgeois culture in which Pound's career
 had been fashioned prior to 1912: a world withdrawn from public life
 and insulated from the grim imperatives of a commodity economy, a
 sphere in which literary culture had been largely privatized, serving
 as a medium of exchange for an exiguous aristocracy of sensibility,
 a court of intellect. Access to this world was strictly controlled:
 the audience, as the program noted, was "limited to FIFTY" (<A
 HREF="1.3rainey02_1.html"> 1</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound's three lectures were scheduled for the 14, 19, and 21 of March,
and immediately after the first one he wrote his father to report his
success: "Have just got my

<B></B>

first lecture off my chest and am ready to rest. Have cleaned up $90
so far."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Yet there were some obvious disadvantages to these proceedings, which
 required that Pound maintain good relations with a network of people
 with influence and power, people who could oblige others to attend his
 lectures, and it left him little room to provoke an audience on whose
 good will he was patently dependent. Further, his access to these
 circles was mediated largely by Olivia Shakespear, creating private
 tensions and constraints that must have been all but unbearable. That
 there were other avenues to an audience would become apparent in the
 unexpected events that attended Pound's second lecture, the one scheduled
 for Tuesday, 19 March 1912.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The topic of Pound's first lecture of 14 March had been Guido
Cavalcanti. His second was to treat "Provence, A.D. 1190: Arnaut
Daniel." Pound was on familiar ground here, discussing the master of
"trobar clus" or "closed verse," the most hermetic vein of troubadour
poetry. Characterizing such poems two months later in an essay based on
this very lecture, Pound would write: "They are good art as the high
mass is good art," works that must be "approached as ritual" because
they sought "to make their revelations to those who are already expert."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Pound, very plainly, was describing not just the work of Arnaut Daniel,
 but his own poetry as well. His lecture on Daniel, his poems and his
 audience, was a wholly self-referential discourse that bespoke its
 own situation. Appropriately--and yet how ironic, when compared with
 Marinetti's lecture that same day--the program for Pound's lecture
 stated that he would discuss Daniel's "possible relation to the Art of
 to-day." (Like Philip Burne-Jones, Pound still conceived of art with
 a capital A.) The time was set for 3:30 p.m.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the morning of the lecture he received a letter from his
fianc&eacute;e, who told him that she would be attending a lecture
that evening--not his, however. She was going "to hear Marinetti
lecture...about les Futuristes" at Bechstein Hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 This was Pound's first experience of ephemeral seduction, seeing
 first-hand the powerful allure of art conceived as public practice,
 as a spectacle capable of attracting an audience much larger than
 fifty, as performance capable of arousing widespread curiosity, debate,
 desire. The next day must have been unforgettable for an avid reader of
 newspapers such as Pound. Not a one took note of "Provence, A.D. 1190:
 Arnaut Daniel." But Marinetti's performance was fully reported in
 the morning edition of <I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, with a headline
 reading "'Futurist' Leader in London," accompanied by the subtitle,
 "Makes an Attack on the English Nation." The next day a second article
 on Marinetti appeared in <I>The Morning Leader</I>, while yet a third
 was published on the second page of <I>The Times</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Odder still, Marinetti had not flattered his audience, but berated it,
 castigating the English as "a nation of sycophants and snobs, enslaved
 by old worm-eaten traditions, social conventions, and romanticism." And
 though <I>The Times</I> reported that "some of his audience begged for
 mercy," <I>The Daily Chronicle</I> noted that "the long-haired gentlemen
 in the stalls and the ladies with Rossetti eyes and lips rewarded him
 with their laughter and applause." Still another observer, writing a
 year later, recalled an audience that "wildly applauded his outspoken
 derision of all their cherished national characteristics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's lecture achieved instant notoriety. After only six weeks in
England, he reported in mid-April, the Futurists had elicited 350 articles
in newspapers and reviews and had earned more than 11,000 francs in sales
($2,200 or &#163;440).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 More important, Marinetti had achieved his success not by addressing
 only an educated elite, but by speaking in a public forum to a wider
 audience. Whereas tickets to each of Pound's lectures had uniformly cost
 10s. 6d., only the most expensive tickets to Marinetti's lecture had cost
 that much, and the lowest-priced tickets had sold for 1s.; and whereas
 Pound's audience had been deliberately "limited to FIFTY," Marinetti's
 may have reached five hundred. (Seating capacity at Bechstein Hall was
 five hundred and fifty.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Still more important, Marinetti's real audience had become not just
 the people who attended his performance in Bechstein Hall, but the
 millions who read about it in <I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, <I>The Morning
 Leader</I> and <I>The Times</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nothing could have made plainer the value of a concerted polemical
onslaught, the formation of a collective identity buttressed by
theatricality and publicity. Sometime in March 1912--it may have been
before Marinetti's lecture, though it was certainly <I>after</I> the
outbreak of publicity surrounding the Futurist exhibition--Pound sent off
the manuscript for his next book of poetry, <I>Ripostes</I>. At the end
of the volume he included a brief statement, since famous as the first
public reference to Imagism: "As for the future, <I>Les Imagistes</I>, the
descendants of the forgotten school of 1909, have that in their keeping."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The use of French, <I>Les Imagistes</I>, to designate the new "school"
 is an obvious echo of the linguistic practice that had led Dorothy
 Shakespear to describe her plans "to hear Marinetti lecture in French,
 about les Futuristes," just as Dorothy's practice had been almost a
 consequence of Marinetti's

<B></B>

own. As Marinetti did not speak English, he delivered all his lectures
in French while in England; and as he also wrote the original versions
for the early Futurist manifestos in French, at least in part because
French was still the lingua franca of European intellectual exchange, it
was natural to speak about him in French as well. It was also the French
version of new manifestos that Marinetti routinely mailed to British
critics and journalists, and while mass circulation dailies translated
quotations into English, the intellectual and cultural weeklies usually
cited the French directly. When Pound, therefore, first announces the
creation of Imagism ("As for the future, <I>Les Imagistes</I>...have
that in their keeping"), he uses a conjunction of terms ("future" and
the name of a movement in French) that plainly signals their provenance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound's subsequent steps toward art as public practice came in the wake
of three events, all of them precipitating a collapse of the "courtly"
structure of cultural production that had characterized Pound's milieu
until now. In June 1912 Margaret Cravens committed suicide, leaving
Pound without the financial support that had sustained him for the
last two years and reinforced his aulic self-conception. In late
October, the publishing firm that had guaranteed him &#163;100 per
year collapsed. Pound was back to where he had started, and it was not
a matter he could easily forget: &#163;500 per annum, his prospective
mother-in-law advised him in September, was the minimum it would take
for him to marry her daughter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In late September, too, Pound learned that Edward Marsh was assembling
 an anthology designed to present the recent work of younger poets as
 a collective project, the Georgians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 By December it had already become clear that the volume was going to be
 a remarkable success. Impelled by these events, Pound began to launch
 Imagism in a more systematic and serious way.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 18 August and sometime in October he sent off poems by himself and
H. D. to <I>Poetry</I> magazine, characterizing them as "Imagiste."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 In December he wrote an essay that surveyed contemporary poetry in
 London--the essay was published in January 1913--and contained his
 second public reference to Imagism, a description that ran for two
 brief paragraphs. Imagism was "the youngest school here that has the
 nerve to call itself a school."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The aggressive tone was at odds with the tentative definitions
 that followed, a contradiction already apparent in the diction. For
 "school" was a term that Marinetti had used in his earliest writings
 on Futurism in 1909, but subsequently rejected for its associations
 with the taxonomies of academic art history, instead adopting the
 term "movement." Indeed, Pound's presentation of "Imagism" implicitly
 underscored its differences from Futurism. Imagism rejected Futurism's
 ethos of collective identity: a school was something more informal,
 more casual, more individualistic, the fortuitous outcome of "two
 or three young men agree[ing], more or less, to call certain things
 good." Imagism also shunned the kind of programmatic ambitions associated
 with Futurism: "a school does not mean in the least that one writes
 poetry to a theory." (Saying this, Pound was echoing contemporary
 reviewers who had complained that Futurist paintings were "rather a
 theoretic extension than a spontaneous development.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Instead Pound stressed the purely technical nature of Imagism: "Their
 watchword was Precision" and they

<B></B>

sought "to produce a good single line" or just "a good short" poem. They
opposed only "interminable effusions." Yet who, after all, would want
to defend interminable effusions? Imagism, in short, was a movement
to end movements: informal, antitheoretical, absorbed in matters of
writerly technique and averse to more global programs that linked poetry
to contemporary social transformations or posed questions about the
status and functions of art. Though Imagism is commonly treated as the
first avant-garde movement in Anglo-American literature, it was really
the first anti-avant-garde movement. And Pound's subsequent efforts to
define Imagism only accentuated these features. In an essay published
two months later in March 1913, written by Pound though printed under
the signature of F. S. Flint, Pound made the opposition of Imagism and
Futurism explicit:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The <I>imagistes</I> admitted that they were contemporaries of the
Post Impressionists and the Futurists; but they had nothing in common
with these schools. They had not published a manifesto. They were not
a revolutionary school; their only endeavor was to write in accordance
with the best tradition, as they found it in the best writers of all
time,--in Sappho, Catullus, Villon.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Accompanying this essay was another, this one signed by Pound, "A Few
Don'ts By an Imagiste," a title implicitly in opposition to the genre
of the manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 It was a timid response to the challenges raised by the Futurist presence
 in London, and in a moment of candor in 1927, Pound himself recalled the
 creation of Imagism in the most mundane terms: "The name was invented to
 launch H. D. and Aldington before either had enough stuff for a volume."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The launching and marketing of a new product--was this all that was at
 stake in the creation of Imagism?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Formulating the question this way fails to acknowledge the complications
and unexpected consequences that were entailed in this novel use of
publicity and advertising in connection with culture, creating new
pressures that became increasingly apparent in the course of Marinetti's
last two visits to England in late 1913 and early 1914. For Pound these
visits were important because Marinetti was increasingly shifting the
front of his activity from the visual arts to literature: in May 1912 he
published the "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature," in August
the "Response to Objections"; in June and November 1913 he issued the
"Destruction of Syntax--Imagination without strings [or: Wireless
Imagination]--Words-in-Freedom;" in October, "The Variety Theater."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 English readers were kept abreast. In September 1913 the journal
 <I>Poetry and Drama</I>, edited by Harold Monro, devoted an entire
 issue to examining Futurism. (Its previous issue, notably, had devoted
 only a paragraph to Imagism.) The issue included a translation
 of "L'immaginazione senza fili ("Imagination without strings" or
 "wireless imagination")," as well as almost thirty pages of poems by
 Aldo Palazzeschi, Paolo Buzzi, and Marinetti himself. And in a long
 editorial, Monro praised Marinetti warmly, hailing him for auguring a
 dissolution of the distinction between poetry and popular culture, art
 and life. Rhapsodizing about the sheer size of futurism's audience--in
 Italy it had "gained the support of no

<B></B>

less than 22,000 adherents" ("V," 263)--Monro became positively
breathless at the thought that <I>I poeti futuristi</I>  had sold
35,000 copies ("V," 264). This fact in itself, Monro said, constituted
"Marinetti's most interesting attitude" ("V," 264). Here, in other
words, was poetry that was no longer written "for...close and studious
scrutiny by the eye" ("V," 264), or poetry "no longer... withheld from the
people" by "educationalists," "intellectuals," or the commercial press
("V," 265), but poetry intended "for the ear," "for immediate and wide
circulation" ("V," 264), poetry "regaining some of its popular appeal"
("V," 265). Single-handedly, Marinetti was restoring poetry to its status
in an earlier era, an age when "the minstrel and the ballad-monger then
represented our modern Northcliffe" ("V," 265). But Monro's reference to
Northcliffe inadvertently signalled some of the tensions latent in the
collapse of life and art that he wished to celebrate: for now it seemed
that there was no longer a meaningful distinction between poetry and the
most ephemeral of commodities, the daily newspaper. Those tensions would
be fully exposed in the course of Marinetti's last two visits to London.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Monro's remarks prefaced Marinetti's arrival in London by two months. Once
again, for six days in November 1913, Marinetti gave daily lectures and
readings that attracted substantial audiences and media attention. Now,
however, Marinetti began to press his attack against elite bourgeois
culture to new limits, assaulting the very principles that had once
grounded his own thinking--principles that still grounded Pound's
own. Already in the "Founding and Manifesto of Futurism" of 1909 Marinetti
had urged that contemporary art be responsive to continuous change and
innovation, emphasizing temporality in a way that tended to blur the
distinction between art and fashion; yet he had hesitated to draw the
logical conclusion that art itself was not an eternal absolute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 To the contrary, as late as 1911 he could still charge that his critics
 feared him precisely because of his defense of art as an absolute:
 "Perhaps they saw, shining from our eyes, the glorious passion that we
 nurture for Art. [The capital <I>A</I> is Marinetti's own.] To art, in
 fact, which merits and which demands the sacrifice of the best, we give
 a love that is absolute...."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 But as early as the "Technical Manifesto" of mid-May 1912 he had begun
 to sound a new note: "Courageously let us set about making the 'ugly'
 in literature, and let us kill solemnity everywhere. Go away! don't
 listen to me with the air of great priests! Every day it is necessary
 to spit on the <I>Altar of Art!</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 And now, in the new lectures that he gave in late 1913, Marinetti pursued
 his conclusions to their ultimate consequences. He damned the sacred
 conception of art: "Art is not a religion," he was quoted as saying on
 17 November at the Poets' Club, "not something to be worshipped with
 joined hands." Instead it "should express all the intensity of life--its
 beauty...its sordidness," and "the very complex of our life to-day"
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 (Pound himself may have attended this lecture, as it is certain many
 of his friends did).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Three days later, <I>The Daily Mail</I> would publish Marinetti's
 manifesto, "The Variety Theatre" or "Le Music-Hall," with its
 intransigent vindication of a despised and popular cultural form. "The
 music hall," wrote Marinetti, " is naturally anti-academic, primitive,
 and ingenuous, and therefore the more significant for the unexpectedness
 of its experiments

<B></B>

and the simplicity of its means.... It destroys the solemn the sacred,
the serious and the sublime of Art with a capital <I>A</I>."

When Marinetti returned to England six months later in May and June of
1914, he was given a chance to put his theories into effect. In June
Marinetti was booked to appear at the Coliseum for an entire week, from
Monday 15 June to Saturday 21 June, twice daily. By now Marinetti had
acquired an almost extraordinary stature in the life of the commercial
press. Mass circulation weeklies such as <I>The Sketch</I> and <I>The
Graphic</I> assiduously reported his doings and sayings. His mocking
self-portrait, an assemblage of discarded pieces of wood attached to a
wire-brush, the bristles of which represented his hair, was featured on
the front cover of the weekly <I>Sketch</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 His views on "Futurist" clothes made headlines, and his every lecture
 was greeted with warm good humor or respectful earnestness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Major newspapers were even competing for advance news stories about
 the "Futurist Music," and three days before the premier <I>The Pall
 Mall Gazette</I> featured a front-page story that was labelled a
 "'P.M.G.' Special" about the rehearsals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 It was a major event indeed when Marinetti had agreed to introduce
 Luigi Russolo and his notorious noisetuners, or <I>intonarumori</I>
 (<A HREF="1.3rainey02_2.html"> 2</A>). Marinetti was crossing
 the boundary into a realm of cultural practice where "traditional art"
 had seldom been seen.

For the Coliseum was not just a music hall in the traditional
sense. Its construction and organization had epitomized a set of new
developments transforming the world of Edwardian entertainment. Its
site on St. Martin's Lane had been selected by Oswald Stoll, the most
successful of Edwardian theatrical entrepreneurs, precisely because
it stood directly across from the exit of Charing Cross station,
all but addressing the crowds of respectable, prosperous people
who poured into the metropolis on a day's shopping excursion (<A
HREF="1.3rainey02_3.html"> 3</A>). Such people might be glad of
an afternoon or evening's entertainment, Stoll had reasoned. They were
"middle-class people for whom a visit to a serious play might seem too
ambitious and a visit to a music-hall far too racy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This was the audience whom Stoll sought to please, presenting them a
 sanitized version of the music hall, a "Palace of Variety" that offered,
 in the words of

<B></B>

its program, "the social advantages of the refined and elegant
surroundings of a Club."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Stoll's theater was part of a wider trend that was changing the music
 hall from a form of entertainment rooted in the culture of working and
 lower-middle classes and instead assimilating it to the tastes of a
 middle class increasingly defined by consumerism. His Coliseum, which
 opened in 1904, was the biggest and most lavish music hall in London. Its
 seating capacity was nearly 4,000, its stage and proscenium the largest
 ever built, and its architecture impossible to ignore: the centerpiece
 was a massive tower that soared into the air, topped by eight cupids who
 held a revolving globe with the name "COLISEUM" in electric lights. Here
 was something to "to catch the attention of those prosperous shoppers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Here was culture as consumption, art as entertainment, and here was the
 place where Marinetti would complete his last performance in England
 (<A HREF="1.3rainey02_4.html"> 4</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The show, paradoxically, was not successful. And contemporary observers
understood the reasons immediately. Reviewing the premiere performance,
<I>The Times</I> wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Signor Marinetti rather mistook his audience yesterday afternoon, when
he tried to deliver an academic exposition of Futurist principles at the
Coliseum, and he had, in consequence, to put up with a rude reception
from a gallery which seemed fully qualified to give him a lesson in his
own "Art of Noises."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti indeed "mistook his audience," ultimately in two different yet
related ways. One was historical. Marinetti had badly misunderstood the
nature of the music-hall itself. For Marinetti's sense of the music-hall
was derived largely from his experience in Italy, where it was still
a vital if troubled genre of urban popular culture, a hybrid form
addressing a public still in the course of transition from a largely
agrarian to a wholly urban lifestyle. It was a form that specifically
spoke to the hybridized experience of people who had recently migrated
to the metropolis, mingling motifs of the village carnival to treat the
dislocations of urban experience. But in the more advanced industrial
culture of England, where the wrenching process of urbanization had
been more fully assimilated, the music hall was already a corpse that
was experiencing a brief but spurious afterlife through its incorporation
into the "Palace of Variety," the new institution of an advancing consumer
economy. The music hall would soon be swept away by the outbreak of World
War I and the arrival of Hollywood cinema. In England, in other words,
the music hall was no longer a hybrid creation of popular culture, but
a prototype of mass commodity culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's second mistake was theoretical. In the simplest terms,
he failed to see that quotation and bricolage are strictly one-way
streets. By this I mean that Marinetti's effort to appropriate,
legitimate, and transform a still illegitimate genre such as the music
hall had the effect not of delegitimating art, as he supposed, but of
reaffirming its legitimacy, insofar as it fostered belief not in the
value of this stake (e.g. the music hall) or that stake (e.g. classical
theater), but in the value of the game in which all the stakes are
assigned value at all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 More concretely, from a position within the already legitimate domain
 of art or high culture it was possible for Marinetti to appropriate and
 legitimate practices of mass culture; but from within the illegitimate
 domain of mass culture, the Coliseum itself, there was no theoretical
 basis of critical distantiation by which to assimilate alien or
 heterogeneous cultural forms. What <I>The Times</I> reviewer termed an
 "academic exposition of Futurist principles" was precisely the kind of
 "serious" and self-reflective discourse that the Coliseum sought to
 exclude. And so it did. After fifteen minutes of Marinetti's first
 lecture the curtain was unceremoniously lowered--there was a danger,
 the stage manager later claimed, that "people would start throwing
 things" (<I>HSB</I>, 186). And for subsequent performances Stoll obliged
 Marinetti to include a gramophone playing records by Elgar, the most
 philistine of all composers, allegedly "to bring a little melody into
 the act."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Though Marinetti finished his run of one week, the Coliseum swiftly
 moved to compensate for the fiasco, bringing in George Robey as its next
 headliner, a performer almost as popular as Marie Lloyd. Marinetti's
 effort to assimilate the concept of art to that of the commodity
 had failed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Imagism was an intellectual failure as an attempt to address the
pressures brought to bear by the forms of cultural practice that
Marinetti was introducing in England, then it must have been doubly
disappointing for Pound to find that his effort to assimilate those same
forms should meet with a different lack of success. For if we take it
that <I>Blast</I> did indeed incorporate the Futurist attack on high
art, that it presented itself as a kind of graphic counterpart of music
hall performance, then

<B></B>

its lack of critical and public acceptance is revealing. For contrary
to what later critics have suggested, contemporary critics were neither
angered nor provoked by <I>Blast</I>. They were simply bored, and bored
not because <I>Blast</I> was an incomprehensible novelty, but because
it was all too familiar. They said so, too, in contemporary reviews:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Almost all the pictures reproduced are (like the typesetting of the first
pages), Futurist in origin, and nothing else. And as for the productions
of the literary Vortices, these are not even so fresh as that.... All
it really is is a feeble attempt at being clever. <I>Blast</I> is a flat
affair. We haven't a movement here, not even a mistaken one.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And in perhaps the most cutting words of all, the same reviewer remarked:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Mr. Pound used to be quite interesting when he was a remote
pass&eacute;ist and wrote about the Proven&ccedil;al troubadours; but as
a revolutionary I would rather have Signor Marinetti, who is at any rate
a genuine hustler, whereas Mr. Pound assuming violence and ruthlessness
is as unimpressive in his movements as a man who is trying to use someone
else's coat as a pair of trousers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Blast</I> was indeed a dull affair, and the poems that Pound published
in it are among the dreariest he ever produced. His attempt to address and
provoke an audience through a programmatic polemical onslaught had proved
a conspicuous failure. And not just in aesthetic, but also in economic
terms. When Wyndham Lewis later recalled the brief moment when he was
the lion of London society as a result of <I>Blast</I> he remembered
how little it served him: "As a result of these sociable activities, I
did not sell a single picture, it is superfluous to say."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Initially, then, Marinetti's practical and theoretical activities in
London during the period 1912-14 had two related effects on Pound and what
has subsequently come to be termed the Anglo-American avant-garde. One
was to provoke a reconration of the relations among the institutions
in which the discourse of art and poetry had been produced until now,
forcing intellectuals and artists to come to terms with the role of new
institutions of mass culture and assess their bearings on the place of
art in a cultural marketplace being radically transformed. The other,
in so doing, was to precipitate a permanent collapse of the entire set
of distinctions between art and commodity, to effect a perceptible and
irreversible levelling of both within the single and amorphous category
of the commodity. Further, by late 1914 it was clear that the attempts to
address or resolve these dilemmas had proved to be failures, whether it
was the rearguard restoration effort of Imagism or the imitative gesture
of <I>Blast</I>. But if one could neither go back to reconstruct the
aristocracy of the salon nor go forward to embrace the egalitarianism of
the commodity, what solution was there? The answer, paradoxically, was
to do a little of both at once--to reconstruct an aristocracy, but to
reconstruct it within the world of the commodity. To accept, in other
words, the status of art as a commodity, even as it was simultaneously
transformed

<B></B>

into a special kind of commodity, a rarity capable of sustaining
investment value. Or to reformulate this, the answer to the levelling
effect precipitated by a consumer economy was to defer consumption
into the future, to transform it into investment; which is to say,
to encourage or even solicit the ephemeral seduction of the consumer
economy, acknowledging the status of art as commodity, but to postpone
and sublimate its consumption by turning it into an object of investment
whose value will be realized only in the future. Art, we might say,
becomes "news that stays news."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In concrete terms, this meant that what had once been an aristocracy of
patronsaloniers would now be replaced by an elite of patron-investors. For
the Anglo-American avant-garde, the future lay in the new patronage
provided by a small group of people such as John Quinn, Harriet Shaw
Weaver, Scofield Thayer, and James Sibley Watson, Jr. The actualization
of this new space within the commodity economy was achieved primarily
through the new and unprecedented use of two institutions that had
already existed for some time, but which now became central to an emerging
apparatus of cultural production: the little review and the limited or
deluxe edition, venues situated in a profoundly ambiguous social space,
simultaneously sequestered and semi-withdrawn from the larger institution
of publishing even while firmly embedded within the market economy. It
was in the little reviews--among them <I>The Little Review</I>, the
<I>Egoist</I> and the <I>Dial</I>--that the principal masterpieces of
the Anglo-American avant-garde would first be published. Likewise, their
second appearance was almost uniformly in limited editions of 200 copies
(such as <I>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</I>) or 254 copies (Eliot's <I>Ara Vos
Prec</I>), or 1,000 copies (<I>Ulysses</I>)--editions at the farthest
possible remove from the 35,000 copies of <I>I poeti futuristi</I>. And in
this new social space, the kind of publicization that had once been aimed
at a mass audience along the lines pursued by Marinetti and imitated by
<I>Blast</I> were no longer of use. Asked by Margaret Anderson in 1917 how
best to announce his collaboration on <I>The Little Review</I>, Pound now
replied: "IF it is any use for adv[ertising]. purposes, you may state that
a single copy of my first book has just fetched &#163;8 (forty dollars)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Similarly, seven years later when William Bird was drafting the
 prospectus for the first edition of <I>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</I>, Pound
 would urge the same argument: "Yr. best ad is the quiet statement that
 at auction recently a copy of Mr. P's [first book] 'A Lume Spento'
 published in 1908 at $1.00 (one dollar) was sold for $52.50."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 These remarks, far from advancing assertions of intrinsic aesthetic
 value based on the presupposition of Art, offer straightforward
 claims about the performance record of investments within a commodity
 economy: by 1917 <I>A Lume Spento</I> had been increasing in value
 at a rate of more than 50 percent a year, by 1924 at 28 percent a
 year. The same, it is implied, should now prove true of <I>The Little
 Review</I> or <I>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</I>. The reason to buy these
 is not necessarily to read them, but to be able to sell them--perhaps
 at a substantial profit. Readers, in short, are giving way to uneasy
 mixture of patron-investors, collectors, and speculators on the rare
 book market, all of these situated within a complex and highly unstable
 institutional space.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What the patron-investors provided with their generous subsidies and
endowments was an institutional sphere that was momentarily immune to the
pressures of a market economy, partially removed from the constraints
of an expansive and expanding mass culture. In this dense new space of
collectors and quasi-investors, large audiences were not a help, but a
hindrance. Consider only the case of the Modern Gallery, which was first
opened in 1916 at 500 Fifth Avenue by Marius de Zayas, a minor artist
and journalist previously associated with Alfred Stieglitz and the
"291" Gallery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The gallery's principal clients were Eugene and Agnes Meyer, Arthur
 B. Davies, Walter Arensberg, and John Quinn. Few but fit. In 1920
 alone Quinn purchased nearly $24,000 worth of works from de Zayas, and
 even after returning two paintings in early 1921, the sum of his 1920
 purchases totaled almost $13,000.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Translated into contemporary res, this might fall somewhere between
 $340,000 and $390,000. Success, even survival, could depend on just
 such a nucleus of patron-investors, as de Zayas was told in 1919 by his
 French colleague, the Parisian dealer Charles Vignier, who was shaken
 when he learned that de Zayas was staging exhibitions that were drawing
 large crowds, with his gallery filled almost daily:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I feel very uneasy to learn that your Gallery is full every day. You
are losing uselessly a precious strength by these vain chatterings. I
would rather hear that you have seen three clients in one week, of whom
one has bought something.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vignier's remarks were perceptive. Ironically, de Zayas was ultimately
forced to close his gallery not because he had failed to attract a large
audience, but because he had succeeded in doing so. That was the dilemma
of the avant-garde.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In responding to it by creating a distinction within the world of
commodity culture, whereby there is one set of cultural commodities
whose value is exhausted in immediate consumption and another whose
worth is deferred or sublated into the future as investment, modernism
gained for itself--for an evanescent moment--a breathing space within the
present, a space from which it could formulate its powerful critique of
commodity capitalism, even as--and at the same time as--it mortgaged that
critique in the future, mirroring the very system that it critiqued. But
the consequences of this precarious and unstable compromise could not be
forever deferred. For it was an inevitable outcome of this situation that
the avant-garde's distaste for the dictates of the marketplace should
ultimately be revealed as disingenuous precisely because, and insofar
as, the works of the avant-garde began to command ever more significant
prices within the larger open market. After that it was only a matter
of time before we should see the emergence of forms of art that were
already "precommodified," art that ironically and even nostalgically
acknowledges its own exchange function, art that finds its richest
moments--in several senses--in the works of Andy Warhol. These are the
<I>tristes tropiques</I> of late capitalism, known in their more naive
form as "post-modernism."

that the social function of the avant-garde was to effect "a necessary
brokerage between high and low [cultures]. In its selective appropriation
from fringe mass culture, the avant-garde searches out areas of social
practice which retain some vivid life in an increasingly administered
and rationalized society" .

See for example Luciano De Maria, <I>La nascita dell'avanguardia: saggi
sul futurismo italiano</I> (Venice: Marsilio editori, 1986), whose
title already announces his equation of the genesis of Futurism and
the birth of the avant-garde. De Maria also mentions "l'avanguardia
storica europea, di cui, a mio parere, il futurismo segna la nascita
effettiva" ; he urges that "Marinetti invent&ograve;, letteralmente,
il prototipo dell'avanguardia storica" ; and he notes "Marinetti e
compagni gi&agrave; gettavano le basi della prima autentica, codificata
avanguardia europea" . An equally crucial role is assigned to
Marinetti and Futurism by Marjorie Perloff in <I>The Futurist Moment</I>
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), hereafter abbreviated
<I>FM</I>. And while Peter B&uuml;rger never mentions Futurism in his
<I>Theory of the Avant-Garde</I>, he does place it alongside Dada and

bibliographies are poorly organized, mingling strictly bibliographical

the recording of titles, authors, journal names, and page references;
moreover, both include publications that have little or nothing to do
with Futurism, but concern Vorticism. Even so, they remain indispensable.

There was one brief report about Futurism in 1910, an article entitled
"Futurist Venice" by Douglas Goldring, which appeared in <I>The Tramp</I>
in August 1910, 487-88. This contained excerpts from "Contro Venezia
Passatista" and "Fondazione e manifesto del futurismo" ("Bib.," B.1;
"Bib. Supp.," D.1). Goldring was the editorial assistant for <I>The
English Review</I>, a journal edited by Ford Madox Ford during the period
1908-1910, and the first important review to publish work by Ezra Pound,
in March 1909. He was also personally acquainted with Pound, and, though
they were not especially close, they saw one another often in 1909 and
early 1910. It is thus possible that Pound was aware of Goldring's report
in <I>The Tramp</I>, since the two men knew one another. Significantly,
Pound's earliest mention of Marinetti consists in a reference to his
manifesto "Contro Venezia Passatista," a reference that appears in
the last paragraph of "Patria Mia. III," <I>The New Age</I> 11 (19
September 1912): 491-92, reprinted in <I>Ezra Pound's Poetry and Prose:
Contributions to Periodicals</I> (New York: Garland Publishing, 1991),
1:79, hereafter abbreviated <I>EPPP 1</I>. The fact is significant because
that is also the manifesto cited by Goldring in his essay in <I>The
Tramp</I>. But by September 1912, when Pound wrote his essay, he could
easily have obtained information about this manifesto from other sources.

Bechstein Hall lecture in September 1913, Harold Monro described "the
little Marinetti" speaking in what he termed "a hugh empty hall," and at
another point he noted that Marinetti spoke "to a handful of English"

Ezra Pound, "Prefatory Note" to "The Complete Poetical Works of
T. E. Hulme" (first published at the end of <I>Ripostes</I> in October
1912), in his <I>Personae</I> (rev. ed., New York: New Directions,
1990), 266.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The chronological limits for the preparation of <I>Ripostes</I> are
as follows. In an undated letter from March of 1912, Pound informs
his father: "The 'mss.' of 'Ripostes' had gone to publishers...." The
letter was evidently written sometime after 1 March 1912, since elsewhere
Pound refers to the coal strike that began on that date. Likewise, it was
written not long before 19 March, since Pound also notes that he must "get
my 'Arnaut' ready for delivery" (Ezra Pound to Homer Pound, unpublished
letter, March 1912; Beinecke, YCAL 43 [Pound Papers]). Most likely it
was around 14 March, therefore, that Pound sent off the manuscript of
<I>Ripostes</I>. However, it should not be assumed that the original
manuscript necessarily contained either the five poems by Hulme that Pound
labelled "The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme," or the "Prefatory
Note" that preceded them, with its mention of "Les Imagistes." Since the
poems and the note were printed at the very end of the volume, they may
have been added after he sent off the manuscripts in mid-March. But how
much later? Pound remained in London, apart from one-day excursions,
from mid-March to the end of April. Probably on 1 May he left London
for Paris, for Dorothy writes to him on 3 May, "I wish I were in Paris"
(<I>EP/DS</I>, 95). At first sight, this is the latest date when Pound
could still have added the text of Hulme's poems, if not the prefatory
note, for while in Paris he would have had difficulty securing a text
of Hulme's works. Even so, he had still not received proofs. After his
arrival in Paris around 1 or 2 May, Pound stayed with the pianist Walter
Morse Rummel until 26 or 27 May (see <I>EP/MC</I>, 110); he then left
for a walking tour in southern France, suddenly returning to Paris on 11
June after learning of Margaret Cravens' suicide (<I>EP/MC</I>, 122). The
proofs for <I>Ripostes</I>, meanwhile, reached Dorothy Shakespear in
England on 12 June (<I>EP/DS</I>, 111), and she immediately forwarded
them to Pound in Paris. On 16 June, while still in Paris and attending
to affairs occasioned by Cravens' death, he wrote her that he had
"just corrected" them (<I>EP/DS</I>, 113). This date, then, would seem
to have been the last when Pound might still have added the poems by
Hulme, or, if they already formed part of the volume, his "prefatory
note" to them. However, some evidence suggests that Pound received and
corrected a second set of proofs for <I>Ripostes</I> some two months
later, in mid-August 1912, after he had returned to London. In a letter
dated [18] August 1912 to Harriet Monroe (<I>SL</I>, 9), Pound writes:
"the proofs of <I>Ripostes</I> are on my desk." If this letter is dated
correctly by Paige, it can only refer to a second set of proofs, and in
that case Pound could easily have added his prefatory note concerning
"les Imagistes" as late as 18 August 1912. I suspect that this is indeed
what happened, a suspicion partly corroborated by the chronology of
Pound's other references to Imagism. For in all of Pound's extant
correspondence, there is not a single reference to Imagism prior
to this one in the letter of [18[ August to Monroe. (The passage in
question is quoted below.) It is also corroborated by an otherwise
curious reference in the "Prefatory Note," in which Pound contrasts
the "School of Images," which had supposedly led to the formation of
Imagism, with more recent movements, noting that "its principles were
not so interesting as those of the 'inherent dynamists'...yet they were
probably sounder than those of a certain French school which attempted
to dispense with verbs altogether...." These are plainly satirical
descriptions corresponding to no movement that actually existed, yet
taken together the references to "dynamism" and the suppression of verbs
seem to allude to the recent developments of Futurism, and in particular
to Marinetti's prescription urging the elimination of all verbs except
those in the infinitive, advocated in the "Technical Manifesto of
Futurist Literature" that was published in May 1912 (F. T. Marinetti,
"Manifesto tecnico della letteratura futurista," originally published in
1912 by the Direction of the Futurist Movement in Milan, as a leaflet
dated 11 May; reprinted in F. T. Marinetti: <I>Teoria e invenzione
futurista</I>, ed. Luciano De Maria [Milan: Mondadori, 1968], 46-54,
hereafter abbreviated as <I>TIF</I>). If so, it further corroborates a
later date for the "Prefatory Note," which would then have been added
after the publication of the "Technical Manifesto." That, in turn,
preceded the death of Cravens by only a few weeks. In short, everything
seems to suggest that Pound did not invent imagism until mid-June or
even mid-August of 1912, only <I>after</I> the controversy surrounding

For examples of discussions quoting Marinetti or other Futurists
in English in mass-circulation publications, see C. Lewis Hind,
"Futurist Painters: Manifestos and Works of an Italian School," <I>The
Daily Chronicle</I>, 4 March 1912, 6; or Anonymous, "Art That Alarms:
Paintings that Nearly Caused Paris Riot Shown in London," <I>The Daily
Mirror</I>, 4 March 1912, 5. These articles, it is true, were quoting
from a group of manifestos that were included in the catalogue to
the exhibition of 1912, all translated into English. But consider the
case of the manifesto "Futurist Sculpture," written by Boccioni and
published in April 1912 ("Manifesto tecnico della scultura futurista"
[1912], published as a leaflet by the Direction of the Futurist Movement
in Milan, dated 11 April). In a French translation, copies of it were
sent to English newspapers and reviewers in early autumn 1912, and as
before, mass-circulation newspapers always quoted from it in English
translation; see Anonymous, "Paris Day by Day: Futurist Sculpture,"
<I>The Daily Telegraph</I>, 30 September 1912, 6, col. 1; Philip Gibbs,
"Futurist Sculpture: The Plastic Arts to be Revolutionised," <I>The Daily
Chronicle</I>, 6 October 1912, 6. In contrast to these, all quotations
are in French in Anonymous, "La Sculpture Futuriste," <I>The Tripod</I>,
November 1912, 20-30; or Anonymous, "Two Futurist Manifestos," <I>The
Academy</I> (30 November 1912), 693.

Biography</I> (London: Longmans, 1959), 189-93. Hassall shows that Marsh
came up with the idea for the Georgian anthology on 19 September 1912;
that he presented the next day to Harold Monro, editor of the <I>Poetry

poets, including Pound, to solicit contributions. Pound's reply is

stuff</I> by an American, I say modern, for it is the laconic speech
of the Imagistes, even if the subject is classic." These appear to be
Pound's earliest references to Imagism in his extant correspondence, but
as the dates in Paige's edition are notoriously unreliable, one cannot
be wholly confident in saying this.

This emphasis stems from Marinetti's assumption that art must respond to
its milieu and his belief that modernity is defined by rapid change. The
presupposition owes much to Baudelaire's observation, "Modernity is
the transient, the fleeting, the contingent; it is one half of art, the
other being the eternal and immutable," in "The Painter of Modern Life,"
<I>Baudelaire: Selected Writings on Art and Artists</I>, trans. E. Charvet
(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972), 403. Marinetti's "Fondazione e Manifesto

On 6 November 1913 Pound left London to stay with William Butler Yeats at
Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch (see Dorothy Shakespear to Ezra Pound,
[5 Nobember 1913], <I>EP/DS</I>, 273). But on 14 November he announced, "I
am coming up on Monday," or 17 November (see Pound to Dorothy Shakespear,
14 November 1913, <I>EP/DS</I>, 273). Marinetti's lecture would surely
have interested him: it was held at the Poets' Club and its subject was
"Futurism in Poetry." Harold Monro attended this event, recalling it in
his essay on "The Origin of Futurism: Futurism and Ourselves," <I>Poetry
and Drama</I> 1 (December 1913), 389-91, here 389. Richard Aldington also
attended some of Marinetti's lectures, most likely including this one; see

bottled badly? ...the two groups differ from each other not in their
