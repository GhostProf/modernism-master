<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
There were two famous phrases about the time: that life had become
better, more joyous, and that Mayakovsky was and remained the best and
most talented poet of our Soviet epoch. For the second phrase I thanked
the author of these words with a personal letter, because they freed me
from the exaggeration of my own significance that had begun to afflict
me in the middle of the 1930s. I love life and am satisfied with it. I do
not need its additional gilding. I do not imagine life outside of mystery
and obscurity, life in the mirrored gleam of the exhibition window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mayakovsky began to be cultivated forcefully, like potatoes in the time
of Catherine the Great. This was his second death. He is not guilty of it.

Mayakovsky and Canonization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the late 1950s, Pasternak wrote perhaps the most succinct, widely
quoted epilogue to Vladimir Mayakovsky's biography and career. In
commenting on the phrase that transformed Mayakovsky into the Soviet
State poet, Pasternak centers on how these words affected his own
consciousness and poetic activity. He responds to the author of this
phrase personally, in writing, stressing the effect of this proclamation
on his own self-image as a poet. However, in addition to revealing his
personal reaction, Pasternak also hints at the extent of the larger
cultural process

<b></b>

that created the new Soviet Mayakovsky. He implies that Stalin's
praise of Mayakovsky was inseparable from the statement of optimism
and victory in Stalin's other famous proclamation from 1935: "Life has
become better, life has become more joyous." As Pasternak suggests,
Mayakovsky's "canonization" was tied to profound changes in Soviet
cultural life in the 1930s.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
The phrase to which Pasternak refers is Stalin's famous statement about
Mayakovsky published in <i>Pravda</i> on 5 December 1935.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Stalin's proclamation appeared in a front-page editorial that declared
 Mayakovsky "the best, most talented poet of our Soviet epoch," and
 added that "indifference to his memory or his works is a crime."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Remembering how this phrase affected him, Pasternak also hints at the
 implications these words carried for the community at large and for
 the control of literary value. In describing the state "cultivation"
 of Mayakovsky, Pasternak inverts the usual implications of the
 agricultural simile. Mayakovsky was propagated like potatoes, but
 instead of bringing nourishment and life, this cultivation brings
 poetic death to Mayakovsky, and presumably to those who were "fed"
 him. Paradoxically, however, the process gives Pasternak life by
 preventing him from becoming the object of this deadly cultivation;
 Pasternak implies that this statement about Mayakovsky allowed him to
 remain both a living man and a living poet.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Within the context of the 1930s, Pasternak's choice of simile hints
 at how the state applied nonliterary projects and plans to literary
 life; it also evokes the enforced collectivization of the 1930s,
 and the agricultural disaster that followed. In the end, however,
 Pasternak is writing not to describe this process,

<b></b>

but to condemn it morally, while absolving Mayakovsky from blame for his
Soviet afterlife. In the sentence "He is not guilty of it," Pasternak
portrays the official Soviet canonization of Mayakovsky as a criminal
act or a moral transgression. He writes to vindicate Mayakovsky by
emphasizing the difference between the living poet and his objectified
image in Soviet culture.

<p>
Most non-Soviet scholars who have discussed Mayakovsky's Soviet
"canonization" have done so in order to judge him; they either absolve
Mayakovsky of guilt, as Pasternak does, or blame him for his posthumous
Soviet myth.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 However, the need to take a position on Mayakovsky's responsibility for
 his "second death" has inhibited study of how precisely this "second
 death" came about. Few scholars have attempted to analyze the Soviet
 cultivation and circulation of the poet's image, a process that, as
 Pasternak implies, centered on the propagation of Mayakovsky himself
 rather than his works. Soviet scholarship could not critically analyze
 the canonization of Mayakovsky. Many of the post-Glasnost writings
 on Mayakovsky in Russia have a sensationalist "true crime" flavor,
 focusing either on his romantic and sexual relationships, or on the
 gory details of his death; other works have resurrected older arguments
 against Mayakovsky's companions, Osip and Lili Brik.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Little, however, has been written about the institutions that
 "cultivated" the new Mayakovsky in the Soviet Union after 1935.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
The context of Stalin's proclamation hints at the multileveled process
of cultivation that would create the new image of Mayakovsky. Stalin's
comment fixed Mayakovsky's official cultural and literary value, resolving
the struggle between Pasternak supporters and Mayakovsky supporters that
had come to a head in 1934 at the Soviet Writer's Union Congress.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Bukharin's speech at the Congress had praised Mayakovsky but declared,
 "the time for agitprop in the Mayakovsky style has passed."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 The <i>Pravda</i> article directly responded to Bukharin in declaring
 that Mayakovsky's work "was and

<b></b>

remains timely." Stalin's pronouncement came in the midst of discussions
that Soviet poetry, unlike prose, was poor and underdeveloped.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 In fact, the overall tone of the <i>Pravda</i> article about Mayakovsky
 was antagonistic, not so much praising him as denouncing his real
 and potential opponents. Even the phrasing of Stalin's remark implied
 that contemporary Soviet poetry was of comparatively low quality. The
 remark about Mayakovsky, then, was specifically targeted at the
 intelligentsia. At the same time, Stalin's words were published
 in <i>Pravda</i> for its general audiences. From the beginning,
 the change in Mayakovsky's status was framed and promoted not only
 as a directive to writers but also as a declaration for the entire
 nation. In this period, all types of readers looked to <i>Pravda</i>
 for signals on shifts in Party policy and attitudes toward the arts.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Stalin's remark, therefore, was both a professional and general
 directive, one that assigned value but did little to create or define
 Mayakovsky's image in Soviet culture.

<p>
Stalin's words may have resolved the debate over Mayakovsky's
significance, but they raised a series of problems for both the party and
the literary intelligentsia that would create a new Mayakovsky. Unlike
Pushkin and other classic poets who were newly "Sovietized" in the 1930s,
Mayakovsky had been dead only five years. Many people still held strong
opinions about his work and retained vivid memories of his person. To
create and affirm a unified, cohesive myth, the state needed to overcome
a number of factors that complicated representations of Mayakovsky
as an exemplary Soviet poet. These included the existence of many
living contemporaries, Mayakovsky's Futurist past, his unconventional
cohabitation with the Briks, his many affairs, his bad reputation among
the masses, and last (but not least) his suicide. One particularly
challenging problem was Mayakovsky's widespread reputation as an
iconoclast and a Futurist, a poet connected with "decadent" Western
literary movements. A worker's comment from 1928 shows the extent to which
Mayakovsky had come to represent incomprehensible, <i>foreign</i> poetry:
"they [modern poets] write completely in the new way, and sometimes we
don't understand anything, because we are used to speaking and reading in
Russian, but some poet speaks in Mayakovsky (<i>po&#8212;Maiakovski</i>),
and we can't understand a thing."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
In affirming Mayakovsky's new position in Soviet literature, Stalin
expressed the party's new degree of involvement in literary matters.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 The <i>Pravda</i> article that quoted Stalin's comments was published
 alongside a special editorial that declared the party's new authority
 over literary criticism and literary activity in general:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The party will devote special attention to questions of criticism and
attract to this work the best literary and scientific powers . . . the
central committee has issued a special directive on criticism and
bibliography. <i>Pravda</i> will analyze questions of artistic literature,
and periodically publish 'literary pages' (<i>litstranitsy</i>)."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Appearing on <i>Pravda</i>'s first literary page, the declaration of
Mayakovsky's new "Soviet classic" status expressed a new party involvement
in questions of literature and literary studies.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 These literary pages would become an important part of <i>Pravda</i>
 during the next few years; in particular, they would mark literary
 anniversaries for the public.

<b></b>

These pages often contained a combination of essays, poems, and other
genres commemorating an author's birth or death. The literary pages
became part of <i>Pravda</i> at the same time that the State began to
celebrate "great" writers' anniversary dates with commemorative texts and
events, most famously in the massive, state-organized "Pushkin jubilee"
of 1937. Stalin's evaluation of Mayakovsky thus inaugurated a new era,
one in which the party took explicit control over literary institutions
and publications, as well as the definition of literary and cultural
value. Stalin's statement about Mayakovsky was part of a larger merger
of political and cultural authority that would be expressed most clearly
in the state sponsored celebrations for literary res, particularly
poets, in the late 1930s. Mayakovsky himself would be celebrated in 1940
with a large, state controlled commemoration of the tenth anniversary
of his death.

<p>
The diverse events and publications of this celebration can be understood
as a "commentary" on Mayakovsky, one that guided interpretation of his
life and work. As Rachel Schmidt has shown, a literary classic does not
simply reflect a certain set of values, but is a complex text containing
diverse, opposing ideals.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Because a text may not necessarily pass on the values of the canonizing
 authority, critical commentary, notes, visual images, and other devices
 are produced in order to guide the reader and determine how the classic
 text will be interpreted. In the Soviet Union, literary celebrations
 became the occasion for producing these kinds of texts, as well as
 exhibits, amateur conferences, musical performances, and monument
 dedications. The 1940 Mayakovsky jubilee created a set of texts and
 events that can be considered a "canonizing commentary." It guided
 interpretation not only (or even primarily) of Mayakovsky's literary
 works, but also of his life, poetic genealogy, and historical role in
 Soviet culture. The state used the creation of such a "commentary"
 to harness the intelligentsia, work out a new genealogy for Soviet
 poetry, and build on the didacticism of the 1937 Pushkin jubilee by
 promoting Mayakovsky as a representative of Soviet cultural identity.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
Theorizing Mayakovsky's canonization as a cohesive cultural process
requires a model of canon formation that can encompass the realities
of Soviet cultural institutions and life in the 1930s. Soviet literary
culture cannot be explained with Western models of canonization that
assume canons are created by an amiable consensus of a group that has
both political and cultural power.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 The Soviet period and the Stalin era in particular require a model
 that can incorporate coercion as well as consensus, and that can
 accommodate a shifting relation between these two methods for creating
 a "classic." Such a model must take into account the long-existing
 chasm between the intelligentsia and the people (<i>narod</i>) in the
 history of Russian and Soviet culture, and must incorporate the physical
 consequences of repressive cultural policy in the Soviet 1930s. Huge
 numbers of writers were imprisoned, sent to camps, murdered, or driven
 into silence as the Soviet canon developed.

<p>
A monolithic model of the canonizing authority does not fit the Stalinist
context, in which political authorities controlled practical aspects of
literary production while a cultural elite produced and affirmed literary
and cultural products. The canonizing authority itself must be split
into political power and cultural elite, as far as such a distinction
can be maintained in theory. The party controlled interpretations and
modifications

<b></b>

of the concept of the classic both by controlling the means of
cultural reproduction (press, media, paper, school curriculum, etc)
and by physically threatening the cultural elite and the masses. At
the same time, the party needed at least the appearance of a separate
cultural authority that affirmed Soviet literary and cultural value,
a stable source of national identity.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 The State thus tried to acquire the cultural authority of the
 intelligentsia and the literary tradition. In this way, the creation
 of a "Soviet canon" in the late 1930s worked hand in hand with the
 purges that destroyed or silenced many artists, writers, and critics.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It is important to note, however, that the canonization process that
 created a Mayakovsky "commentary" loosened the intelligentsia's
 hold on cultural authority not only through repression, but also
 through dilution. The Party tried to dissolve the specificity of
 the intelligentsia as a social group by involving the masses in
 making the "commentary." In the 1930s, the general population, with
 state sponsorship, became part of the canonizing authority. Popular
 involvement in literary celebrations, for example, was a major theme
 of jubilee rhetoric and an essential component of jubilee events.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 A more dynamic, complex model of canonizing authority, and a more
 skeptical analysis of the "commentary" itself, is needed to explain
 Mayakovsky's canonization.

<p>
The first Soviet "commentary" on Mayakovsky suggests that canonization is
never complete, and that commentaries are neither all encompassing nor
static. Like Schmidt, Iuri Striedter argues that the literary classic
retains contradictory, potentially subversive values. According to
Striedter, in judging a text to be a classic, a canonizing authority must
canonize the whole work, not simply parts of it. Consequently, those parts
of the text that do not support the values of the reigning ideology must
also be canonized and made available to readers. The classic is therefore
always dynamic; the process of canonization can not completely eliminate
the potential of the textual artifact to support alternate and possibly
subversive meanings and values.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 This model of canonization can also be applied to the Soviet
 canonization of Mayakovsky himself in the 1930s; this process centered
 on the poet's biography, physical appearance, and reputation. Striedter
 suggests using the term canon mainly for texts, however he suggests
 it can be applied (cautiously) to authors and genres.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Striedter perhaps underestimates the Party's power to alter
 and destroy the textual artifact as well as the biography and
 physical being of the author. The Soviet canonizing authority could
 indeed eliminate or fail to publish sections of a text. Political
 authorities destroyed the classic's subversive potential not only
 through reinterpretation, but through physical violence and control
 over publishing. Censorship, obligatory rewrites, the library
 "special depository" (<i>spetskhran</i>), selective publishing,
 and outright destruction of texts were all ways of maintaining
 this control. Nevertheless, Striedter's model helps to explain
 how Mayakovsky managed to retain contradictory meanings even after
 canonization. In short, the canonical commentary designed to limit
 the classic Mayakovsky's subversive potential would, like the classic
 itself, turn out to be far from monolithic; the literary texts that
 composed it themselves contained potentially subversive aspects.

<p>
Creating this Soviet commentary required control of authoritative sources
of evidence. Lili Brik had begun her letter to Stalin by emphasizing
her role as keeper of

<b></b>

Mayakovsky's archive: "All affairs connected with publication of his
poetry and commemoration of his name have been centered on me. I have his
entire archive, manuscripts, notebooks, and drafts, all of his things. I
am editing his editions. I am approached for materials, information,
and photographs."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 However, after 1935, the state took over her role as caretaker of
 Mayakovsky's legacy, including the poet's manuscripts, artifacts,
 and publications. In October 1938, a state directive declared all of
 Mayakovsky's archive to be state property, and moved to concentrate
 his artifacts and manuscripts into a single and official location.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The new Mayakovsky Museum, located in the flat he had shared with the
 Briks, was placed under government control and declared the central
 base for the new "Mayakovsky editorial commission" that was preparing
 the poet's collected works and that oversaw the archive.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 State control over the creation and continued existence of a Mayakovsky
 commentary depended on the 1938 state directive. The directive meant
 that the state could regulate and suppress not only existing texts,
 but also future production and verification of published memoirs
 and other sources of "fact." In 1938, the Mayakovsky Museum began to
 record memoirs of Mayakovsky and began soliciting any reminiscences
 or memories that citizens had of the poet. The museum staff's effort
 to collect memories and primary source documents was supported by many
 former friends and colleagues of Mayakovsky, and reveals a complex set
 of motivations. It can be seen as an attempt to preserve the past and to
 enable a more complete study of Mayakovsky's work and life. But it was
 also clearly an effort to fix memories and experiences of Mayakovsky
 in state institutions and authoritative textual forms that could be
 processed, controlled, cited, or hidden. Control over Mayakovsky's
 archive, and memoirs in particular, was what ultimately made possible
 the Mayakovsky celebration that was held in April 1940. In January, an
 official party directive established a committee to oversee preparations
 for a celebration to mark the tenth anniversary of Mayakovsky's death.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky celebration would involve both the mass population and
 the literary community in creating Mayakovsky's new "classic" image.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Soviet Literary Celebrations of the 1930s as Canonizing Institutions
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Like the Pushkin celebration of 1937, Stalin's 1935 statement about
Mayakovsky and the April 1940 celebration was in part meant to oppose
the Russian emigration by opposing their promotion of Russian "high"
culture with a Soviet "high" culture.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Nor was the 1940 jubilee an isolated or unique event. Celebrations and
 festivals so permeated this period that several scholars have applied
 the term "celebration culture" to the Soviet culture of the 1930s;
 massive public commemorations marked great cultural, scientific, and
 exploratory achievements (<i>PC,</i> 1-7). Among these celebrations,
 state-sponsored anniversary celebrations for "Soviet" authors, literary
 jubilees, were new and prominent developments in the cultural life of
 this period.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Most of them honored nineteenth-century Russian authors, but
 some celebrated great authors of "world" (invariably European)
 literature. However, even these were meant to demonstrate the Soviet
 people's great cultural advancement and their status as the true heirs

<b></b>

of the best cultural traditions.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 The largest and most studied of these celebrations, the Pushkin
 celebration, stretched into a whole year of events, texts, and
 commemorations for the entire nation.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The Mayakovsky celebration reinforced for writers the specific options
that Stalin's statement had implied. Other literary jubilees of this
period presented a similar set of alternatives: in 1937 vicious newspaper
reports of trials and "enemies" alternated with warm, joyous articles
about Pushkin and the celebration. Marcus Levitt has seen this phenomenon
in the Soviet press as a contrast between negative and positive ideals
for the new Soviet man.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The alternation of opposing images, however, seems more specifically
 oriented towards writers and critics. It reinforced popular suspicion
 and distrust of intellectuals while subjugating the intelligentsia
 into a state controlled literary event. Celebrating Pushkin alongside
 the purges demonstrated the alternatives presented to the literary
 intelligentsia: the potential for writers to be either "enemies"
 or "heroes" of the state. This contrast would become a major theme
 structuring the Mayakovsky celebration.

<p>
In appropriating the literary celebration to create the new image of the
Soviet poet, the State adopted an institution with a cultural tradition
in Imperial Russia. Since the 1880 Pushkin celebration, the literary
jubilee had been an institution in which, by gathering to celebrate a
literary classic, the intelligentsia affirmed its own cultural unity and
liberal values. Previous scholars have interpreted these celebrations
as an incarnation of a cultural "middle ground," a free neutral zone in
which members of the intelligentsia could express themselves and affirm
their group identity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 This ideal of the celebration continued even during the Imperial
 government's 1899 Pushkin anniversary jubilee. In 1899, though many
 intellectuals abstained from the state-sponsored events in protest,
 they held their own "private" celebrations to express the anniversary's
 meaning for them.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, the Soviet government, in sponsoring these literary
 celebrations, intentionally evoked the traditional role of the
 celebration as a forum for "free" intellectual discourse while
 controlling all aspects of publishing and other events. Soviet jubilees,
 unlike previous celebrations, combined the rhetoric of free intellectual
 debate with total centralized organization and censorship. In the 1930s,
 unlike the 1880s, the mass media could saturate the general population
 (many of whom were newly literate) with commemorative programs and
 texts. Because the party controlled all aspects of literary production
 and cultural activity, it was possible to coordinate print genres with
 jubilee events such as exhibits and conferences.

<p>
Scholars of Russian literary celebrations have usually treated them
either as occasions for rhetoric or as temporally limited public events.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 However, in conceptualizing the <i>Soviet</i> literary celebrations
 of the 1930s, it is difficult to separate texts from events or to
 distinguish the newspaper coverage of the jubilee from the jubilee
 itself. Establishing temporal limits for the celebration also becomes
 difficult: the 1937 Pushkin celebration stretched into a year-long
 event (often referred to as the "Pushkin Year") that intensified on
 Pushkin's death anniversary, but was not limited to it. Similarly,
 newspapers blurred the distinction between reports on preparations
 and reports on the actual jubilee exhibits and conferences. Newspapers
 reported on planning for conferences,

<b></b>

exhibits, and other events and texts to be produced for the
celebration. Several newspaper and journal articles from 1937 instruct
editors and journalists to frequently publish information about jubilee
preparations, as well as informational notes and letters from readers,
in order to raise expectations while reinforcing the national character
of the event.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 On the anniversary date, newspapers typically produced a multigeneric
 <i>litstranitsa</i> that included criticism, biography, poetry, and
 visual images; after the anniversary date newspaper articles described
 and evaluated the events and speeches of the celebration. In this way,
 they prepared readers for the celebration day, and then interpreted
 the events after the fact.

<p>
Defining a boundary between text and event in this period is all the
more difficult because newspaper layouts produced for the jubilee
combined features associated with both public exhibit and private
reading. Published literary pages displayed a multigeneric "exhibit"
of the author on or near the author's anniversary. Because the literary
pages published for the Mayakovsky celebration came out on or near the
anniversary of his death (April 14), they appeared within the strictest
temporal boundaries of the jubilee; moreover, they were regulated as
tightly as other aspects of the celebration. Like exhibitions, they
included memoirs, poems, and photographs. However, these were designed
for private reading rather than public viewing. At the same time, a
volume of photographs and portraits published in 1940 was designed to
be used as a permanent, portable "exhibit" of Mayakovsky in a public
setting such as a worker's club or a classroom.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Periodicals distributed plans for jubilee participants to follow in
 organizing events, as well as artistic texts. For all these reasons,
 Soviet celebrations must be examined as both print and event. Previous
 scholars have pointed out that Russian literary jubilees have always
 been cultural institutions with a specific social function, rather than
 just occasions for literary criticism or praise ("GR," 179-80). The
 Soviet celebrations were all-encompassing cultural institutions which
 penetrated all aspects of the mass media and cultural life. Mayakovsky's
 canonization was accomplished not through fiat, but through this
 institution that created his new symbolic and cultural value.

<p>
In his study of the "Gogol Days," Moeller-Sally applies a typology taken
from Don Handelman's <i>Models and Mirrors: Towards an Anthropology
of Public Events</i> to the institution of the literary celebration
(ibid.). Handelman separates public events into three types: events that
model, events of presentation, and events of representation.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Events that model are transformative and goal oriented, intended to
 produce a qualitative change in the real world. Events of presentation
 reflect a uniform vision of the social order and present no conflicting
 perspectives, creating their effect through an interaction between
 the event and the social order. Events of representation are more
 flexible, containing multiple perspectives that don't challenge the
 social order but "represent" conflicts or confrontations that exist
 within the social order (<i>MM,</i> 40-9). Moeller-Sally suggests that
 pre-revolutionary Russian literary jubilees mainly combine events of
 presentation and those of representation ("GR," 179-80). Applied to
 Soviet literary celebrations of the 1930s, this typology demonstrates
 the shift in jubilee function in this period. Soviet jubilees of the
 1930s were transformative, and primarily combined

<b></b>

aspects of Handelman's "events that model" and "events of
presentation." In this period, Soviet literature was designed to
act upon readers, making them into good Soviet citizens, rather than
simply providing reading material (<i>MSR,</i> 2). The Soviet jubilee
participant, like the reader, was an object rather than a recipient;
the jubilee sought to transform him or her into a Soviet citizen who
acknowledged the values and persona promoted in the name of the classic
poet.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Explicit dissent and acknowledged diversity of opinion were not part of
 the jubilee events in the 1930s. They displayed a unified view of the
 social order and the literary classics. Through various participatory
 events and texts, they were to shape the public into Soviet citizens
 and writers into servants of the state.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Pre-revolutionary literary celebrations have been discussed as a means
to promote national identity.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 Strictly speaking though, literary celebrations in general support
 cultural unity and identity, not strictly political identity. This
 is what made them so useful to the Soviet state. The 1930s literary
 celebrations promoted cultural identity and unity based on the Russian
 literary tradition.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 The ideals promoted by celebrations, particularly those for poets,
 joined the communal and personal aspects of being "cultured." In part
 they linked the new concept of "culturedness" (<i>kul'turnost'</i>)
 that was promoted in this period with what Jeffrey Brooks has called
 "culturism." The concept of "culturedness" in the 1930s encompassed
 cultural literacy, hygiene, and political consciousness. As promoted by
 the State, this new concept of "culturedness" was meant to encourage
 a revaluation of education and behavior, hygiene, and material goods
 previously considered suspect.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Rather than nationalism, which promotes unity based on the nation-state,
 culturism promotes the idea that a certain culture unifies, or should
 unify, all the people.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 Though Brooks describes culturism as the "attitude" that educated
 classes held towards the lower classes, culturism also represented the
 attitude that newly educated people held towards their own cultural
 advancement. Like pre-revolutionary celebrations, 1930s literary
 jubilees expressed culturism; however, they expressed a culturism that
 was largely state controlled. The rhetoric of the celebrations promoted
 the poet and the event itself as a source of both "culturedness" and
 culturism. The Soviet "classic" poet thus embodied and enabled both
 personal achievement and cultural unity.

<p>
The literary jubilees of the late 1930s expressed the government's
first definitive approach to the Russian literary heritage; it finally
resolved a debate over the literary heritage that had raged through the
1920s. Many writers, critics, and politicians had regarded the classics
as a potentially dangerous product of bourgeois culture, an inheritance
that was inherently suspect. Others declared that, like property, the
classics should be distributed to the working class; moreover, they argued
that the classics should serve as stylistic models for the new Soviet
literature. The State had adopted no definite position in this debate.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, state-approved criticism and political rhetoric began to
 describe Pushkin and other pre-revolutionary authors as forefathers
 of Soviet culture, progressive minds, and spiritual contemporaries
 of Soviet life (<i>RC,</i> 113). This new attitude was not so much
 to promote the classics as stylistic models for Socialist Realism
 as to historicize Soviet literature as the natural final development
 of the Russian literary tradition. Vladimir Paperny has discussed a
 similar movement

<b></b>

towards historical continuity and standardization in the architecture of
this period: "The basic problem of architecture becomes [in the 1930s]
the assimilation of the heritage."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 Stalinist culture was portrayed as the end development of all culture,
 the goal towards which all history had been evolving. The 1940
 Mayakovsky celebration in particular expressed this idea in the literary
 sphere. The Mayakovsky jubilee was the first celebration for a Soviet
 author's death anniversary and the first jubilee for a Soviet-era
 poet. As such, it helped to historicize the first decade of Soviet
 rule, making this period a part of "history" and imagining Mayakovsky
 as belonging to the literary canon, thus breaking his very real ties
 to living writers and to continuing literary debates. Mayakovsky's
 canonization, then, was not only about creating a state "classic"
 poet as a mouthpiece of Soviet propaganda; it legitimized Soviet
 cultural and literary history. The Pushkin celebration had symbolized
 and expressly promoted a new unified narrative of Soviet poetry as a
 single line of development from Pushkin. In 1940 jubilee rhetoric,
 Mayakovsky represents the final flowering of Soviet literature,
 the last stage that completes the symbolic development of Soviet
 literature and justifies its origins. By historicizing Mayakovsky,
 the 1940 jubilee confirms the finality of this stage.

<p>
By sponsoring official literary celebrations, the State took
over the Russian intelligentsia's traditional use of literary
anniversaries. Jubilee celebrations in the pre-revolutionary modernist
period had been an important means by which Russian Symbolist and
Acmeist poets, in particular, defined their "mythological chronology." By
celebrating Pushkin, they had affirmed the parallels between the "Silver"
and "Golden" ages of Russian culture, and declared Pushkin as their own
literary "father."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Soviet celebrations of the 1930s similarly used the jubilee to
 express a correspondence between historical periods: the "Golden Age"
 of Pushkin and the era of Stalin. Numerous essays published for the
 Pushkin celebration portrayed the Soviet people as Pushkin's true
 contemporaries, the fulfillment of his prophecy (<i>PC,</i> 118). See,
 for example, how Ivan Luppol portrays Pushkin as a godlike re,
 emphasizing his all-seeing gaze, a feature normally attributed to
 Stalin:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And this man&#8212;because he was a man&#8212;looks at us today with his
intelligent, penetrating eyes. We feel his gaze on us and are proud of
it. And we say to him: Pushkin, your words:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And at the entrance to the tomb
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let a young life play . . .
<br />
have come to pass. At the grave of the great Russian poet a young,
joyous socialist life is playing.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In Luppol's formulation, Pushkin thus not only envisions the Soviet
future, but also remains alive in some eternal realm, watching over the
Soviet people as Stalin does.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 The Pushkin celebration effectively created a new "mythological
 coordination" which aligned the Stalinist 1930s with the "Golden Age,"
 appropriating for the state the earlier self-mythology of the Russian
 intelligentsia.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky jubilee drew on this parallel by suggesting that
 Mayakovsky's historical position was parallel to Pushkin's: just as
 Pushkin was the source of the Russian literary tradition, Mayakovsky
 embodied the new Soviet literature. Articles stressed Mayakovsky's
 role as the "Sun of Soviet

<b></b>

Poetry," heir to the Pushkinian tradition.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky jubilee developed and affirmed the parallel historical
 roles created for the two poets in critical articles published for
 the 1937 Pushkin celebration.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
By participating in the Literary celebrations of the 1930s, the population
could express its Soviet cultural literacy and could learn the correct
forms for praising the Soviet classics. The literary jubilees proclaimed
the unity of Soviet peoples in celebrating classic authors, while their
very existence reinforced the implicit hierarchy that made the Russian
cultural tradition primary in Soviet culture.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 In theory, Soviet cultural unity was supposed to be expressed by staging
 similar literary celebrations for authors of the "brother republics,"
 but their equivalency was belied by the massive scale of the Pushkin
 celebration. In fact, despite their rhetoric, Soviet jubilees expressed
 the supremacy of the Russian culture in two ways: first through the
 larger amount of resources devoted to Russian authors like Pushkin
 and Mayakovsky, and second by making a Russian cultural institution,
 the literary jubilee, the basis for creating and affirming cultural
 value. An unsigned piece of propaganda, published for the Lermontov
 celebration in 1939, presents the official symbolism of the literary
 celebrations, tying them to the 1939 Soviet invasion of western Ukraine
 and Byelorussia:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
All the peoples of the Soviet Union ceremonially commemorate the great
Russian poet. . . . The cultural holiday dedicated to Lermontov will enter
the ranks of the cultural holidays dedicated to poets and poetic works
of other peoples of the USSR: [Taras] Shevchenko, [Shota] Rustaveli,
[Ilias' Lusif Gandzhevi] Nizami. . . . This "roll-call" of great names
reveals with obvious conviction the brotherly friendship of all the
Soviet peoples and their great cultural mission. . . . We will reveal for
our brothers, freed by the valorous Red army from the overlord's yoke
in western Ukraine and western Byelorussia a path to all the cultural
riches of modernity and the cultural heritage of the past.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
These Soviet literary celebrations presented a cultural tradition not
tied to language or ethnicity, but to the Soviet State and to Soviet
communist doctrine. Celebrations demonstrated Soviet cultural unity by
showing how the other republics embraced Russian culture.

<p>
The events and texts of the 1940 celebration promoted Mayakovsky as the
foundation for the Soviet culture that unified the national literatures
of the republics. Jubilee essays and memoirs stressed Mayakovsky's own
active role in unifying the republics during his extensive travels across
the Soviet Union and abroad, through his family history (like Stalin,
he was born in Georgia), and through his attention to poets of other
nationalities.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky celebration thus created a vision of Soviet cultural
 identity that was synchronically bound by the different Soviet peoples
 and diachronically bound to the Russian literary and cultural tradition.

<p>
Juxtaposing the 1937 Pushkin jubilee with the 1940 Mayakovsky celebration,
one can see how the latter demonstrated the supposedly increased tempo
of historical progress in Stalinist society. A main theme of the Pushkin
jubilee of 1937 was the gulf between pre- and post-revolutionary reality:
the Pushkin celebration supposedly expressed a sincere popular adoration
of the poet that had been impossible in the Imperial

<b></b>

period. In contrast, the Mayakovsky celebration marked a ten-year period
entirely within the Stalin era. The celebration was an occasion to note
that Soviet life had in this period fulfilled Mayakovsky's hopes and
dreams. During the Mayakovsky celebration's commemorative evening held
in the Bolshoi Theater Alexander Fadeev began his talk by affirming the
great transformation of Soviet life since 1930: "In this time socialism
has been built in our country."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 It is clear that the celebration did not merely revise the public's
 image of Mayakovsky or promote a politicized interpretation of the poet,
 though these were certainly important goals of its organizers. As a
 celebration of Soviet achievement, it portrayed authors and literary
 accomplishments with the same model of progress that characterized
 other spheres of Soviet society. By the fact of its existence, the 1940
 celebration expressed a new Soviet poetic ideal, portraying Mayakovsky
 as the ultimate merger of literary and political advancement.

<p>
Levitt has said that the literary jubilees of the 1930s represented
that tradition's complete transformation into a state ideological tool,
a process that had begun with the Imperial Pushkin celebration of 1899
(<i>RLP,</i> 158-64). Though he suggests that the 1937 Pushkin celebration
was the culmination of this process, the transformation was most fully
expressed in the Mayakovsky celebration of April 1940. Unlike the Pushkin
celebration, the Mayakovsky celebration allowed none of the poet's works
to escape from the language of Soviet ideology. Slogans and excerpts from
Mayakovsky's most politically engaged Soviet works were the standard fare,
while many of his pre-revolutionary poems, particularly ones in which
the poet's biographical persona predominated, were de-emphasized and
rarely republished in popular editions. Texts printed for the celebration
repeated Stalin's comment about Mayakovsky like a mantra; the quotation's
prominent place in jubilee displays reminded all that the celebration's
forms, texts, and events were to be seen as an incarnation of Stalin's
words. Although everyone knew the source of the "best, most talented"
formulation, this phrase was always explicitly attributed to Stalin in
jubilee articles, banners, displays, and books. The prominent linking
of Stalin with literary value is somewhat unusual, in fact: Friedberg
has found that certain accepted authorities (such as Lenin and Nikolai
Chernyshevsky) were commonly cited in the 1930s to settle arguments and
support interpretations of the classics; Stalin, however, was never one
of these unquestionable authorities (<i>RC,</i> 117). By contrast, in
1940 Stalin was the primary authority supporting Mayakovsky's cultural
and literary value. The explicit references to his authority throughout
the celebration show the greater degree of political significance and
intimidation expressed in the canonization of Mayakovsky and reinforce
the implication that the jubilee was a direct expression of Stalin's will.

<p>
As Alekseeva has noted, "the tenth anniversary of Mayakovsky's
death became a pretext for the mass inculcation of the 'necessary'
Mayakovsky into social consciousness" ("DLS," 179). The 1940 celebration
simultaneously addressed the masses' preconceptions about Mayakovsky
and enlisted them and the intelligentsia in composing a state-approved
"commentary" that would frame Mayakovsky for future readers. The
Mayakovsky jubilee was an important publishing and cultural event,
spawning three compilation volumes, hundreds of articles and memoirs,
symphonies, film scripts, biographical

<b></b>

fiction, poems, anthologies, teaching plans, portraits, and other texts
and events.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 New collections of Mayakovsky's work appeared, including a large
 one-volume edition designed for mass consumption. As in the Pushkin
 jubilee, readings, exhibits, amateur and professional conferences,
 and commemorative evenings were held all over the Soviet Union. The
 commemorative evening held at the Bolshoi Theater was attended by
 political and literary dignitaries and reported on in all of the major
 papers. Fadeev's speech at this event was published as a separate
 booklet in 50,000 copies. Museums and libraries created Mayakovsky
 exhibits for their patrons and sponsored amateur conferences and
 readings.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 A documentary film, with a script written by O. Brik, was shown at
 jubilee evenings and lectures, while the papers touted an artistic
 film about Mayakovsky in the works.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Commemorative Mayakovsky texts and events saturated the anniversary
 on 14 April 1940 and continued throughout the year.

<p>
Many of the materials published for the celebration centered, as literary
jubilees usually did, on reinventing the cultural myths of the poet's
person. Library and education magazines debated how best to introduce
Mayakovsky to various types of readers.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
 In particular, the celebration seemed to require the publication
 of numerous "factual" accounts of Mayakovsky's life for the general
 reader. Poetry praising Mayakovsky in newspaper <i>litstranitsy</i> and
 jubilee volumes also granted him "classic" status by describing him as
 a literary interlocutor for both amateur and professional poets. Many
 poems were published and performed for the celebration; the most
 prominent was by Mayakovsky's friend, the poet Nikolai Aseev, whose
 long poem <i>Mayakovsky Begins</i> (<i>Maiakovskii nachinaetsia</i>
 [1940]) won the first Stalin prize for poetry in 1941. The 1940
 anniversary produced the first comprehensive body of texts (such as
 homage poetry) and events (such as exhibits and school theatricals)
 that supported Mayakovsky's status as a literary classic of Soviet
 culture. In promoting these types of texts in 1940, critics affirmed the
 hierarchy of genres composing the Mayakovsky commentary. They repeatedly
 asserted that personal observations, the "fact" of memoirs, had to
 be subordinated to the "truth" of formulaic biographical narrative
 that would define Mayakovsky for future generations. Texts like Victor
 Shklovsky's <i>O Maiakorskom</i> (<i>About Mayakovsky,</i> published in
 English as <i>Mayakovsky and His Circle</i>) were printed in tiny runs
 of 5,000 and were savaged in reviews for their "incorrect biographical
 method" (in Shklovsky's case this referred to the indeterminate genre
 and personal content of his memoiristic/autobiographical/artistic
 work). Formulaic third-person narratives of Mayakovsky's evolution
 into a great Soviet poet were published in huge printings of 100,000
 copies. Of course, the content of published texts about Mayakovsky
 was censored and negative features were not allowed to appear.

A Mayakovsky for the Masses
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Unlike contemporary American commemorations of literary anniversaries,
the Mayakovsky jubilee celebration was to be an event not just for
academia but for everyone.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 General readers experienced the jubilee through commemorative newspaper
 <i>litstranitsy</i> that functioned as miniature exhibits for the mass
 reader, combining photos,

<b></b>

sketches, critical articles, memoirs, and poetry in a commemorative
layout. The public was invited to take part in amateur reading circles,
attend a lecture series, and write verse or essays for the local
newspapers. In other words, the public participated in the celebration
not only as an audience but also as writers and scholars. In addition
to the scholarly memoirs written by Mayakovsky's literary colleagues,
popular memoirs portrayed Mayakovsky from the perspective of the average
audience member at one of his performances, or depicted a chance meeting
with the poet. Verses by amateur writers and children were published
in the jubilee edition of the newspapers. The celebration thus demanded
at least the image of active participation.

<p>
Soviet scholarship on the literary jubilees of the 1930s, not
surprisingly, reads them as evidence that the masses had made
the literary heritage and its values their own. In the press, the
Mayakovsky celebration was described&#8212;as the Pushkin celebration
had been&#8212;as evidence of the Soviet people's cultural literacy and
emotional attachment to the poet.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
 The celebration supposedly expressed the people's "burning love for
 the best, most talented poet of our epoch."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 Both contemporaries and later Soviet scholars described these events
 as spontaneous manifestations of Soviet unity, humanism, and love. The
 following interpretation is typical:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
With great love the workers marked these jubilees dedicated to the
producers of patriotic literature: Chernyshevsky, [Nikolai] Gogol,
[Leo] Tolstoy, [Mikhail] Lermontov, [Nikolai] Nekrasov, the classic of
Azerbaidzhani literature M[irza-Fatali] Akhundov. . . . The measures
taken bore witness to the Soviet people's great mastery of the spiritual
values of the classical heritage. In reality the official ceremonies
turned into mass holidays of the multi-national Soviet culture.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, these celebrations were not spontaneous, but state-sponsored
and controlled. Moreover, the passivity of the participants in these
celebrations was a constant problem for the organizers.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 Though official rhetoric portrayed them as spontaneous manifestations of
 popular love for culture, the explicit didacticism of the celebrations
 indicated that the cultural level of the people was not as high as
 was desired. Speeches at the Pushkin celebration, while interpreting
 the jubilee as proof of the "dawn of Soviet culture" were typical in
 citing its didactic goals:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Undoubtedly the Pushkin festivities themselves, having unfolded into
such a grandiose cultural parade on the basis of the huge victories of
socialism in our country, are having and will have the most beneficial
effects on the further development of the culture of the numerous peoples
populating the Soviet Union.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The rhetoric that portrayed jubilees as spontaneous expressions of emotion
was contradicted by these stated hopes and by the explicitly didactic
aims of the organizers. Similar goals were espoused during the Mayakovsky
celebration, which not only taught a public unfamiliar with his work,
but proclaimed Mayakovsky's bond with the people while simultaneously
countering popular preconceptions about the poet. Mayakovsky was to be
presented as "national/popular" (<i>narodnyi</i>) and "comprehensible"
(<i>poniatnyi</i>).

<b></b>

Ultimately, therefore, the celebration sought the participation of
the mass population in order to control their exposure to Mayakovsky
and to teach them to associate the "Soviet classic" with his person
and reputation.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
During the 1940 jubilee, Soviet citizens engaged Mayakovsky's newly
ideologized biography, works, and literary significance through reading,
but also through participating in events. Amateur conferences and
gatherings of factory reading-circles were organized by party operatives
who would be sure to be politically correct. The jubilee not only promoted
the proper interpretations of Mayakovsky's life and works, it created
the image of a nationwide public participation in the affirmation of its
themes. For example, commemorative issues of magazines and newspapers
published numerous "popular" voices asserting Mayakovsky's value for
the Soviet people. Memoir sketches and testimonials from citizens were
published in literary journals, popular journals, and national and
provincial newspapers. "The Living Mayakovsky," an article published
in the journal <i>Literaturnoe Obozrenie</i> exemplifies how critics
could use "popular" memoirs to create a new "popular" discourse about
Mayakovsky to counter the masses' preconceptions. The article's author,
Oleg Leonidov, published a mosaic of excerpts from memoirs that appeared
in provincial newspapers, explaining how they proved Mayakovsky was a
kind, decent man (instead of a vulgar bohemian), who assisted other poets
and wrote comprehensible verses that expressed the soul of the nation.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
 Leonidov's use of "popular" memoir sketches to make these points in
 a literary magazine demonstrates how images of popular involvement
 in the celebration were used to create the new Mayakovsky myth;
 they were transformed into authoritative voices that rivaled those of
 Mayakovsky's former friends and colleagues. These themes were sounded
 directly in slogans, criticism, and editorial articles; however,
 artistic and documentary genres played an equally important role in
 revising the image of Mayakovsky. Published jubilee poems, anecdotes,
 and memoirs, often by "average" people, created images of personal
 interactions with the great poet.

<p>
The 1940 Mayakovsky celebration occasioned great efforts by librarians,
teachers, and others to organize exposure to Mayakovsky and to certain
of his works. Instructions for librarians, published in <i>Krasnyi
Bibliotekar'</i> [<i>Red Librarian</i>], outlined in detail the ways
local librarians should propagandize Mayakovsky.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
 It was their responsibility to organize exhibits and amateur
 conferences, advise patrons, collect responses, and recommend poetry
 and criticism. Like the 1937 Pushkin celebration, the Mayakovsky jubilee
 included events at collective farms, local libraries, reading rooms, and
 factories. Special "Mayakovsky" features&#8212;including testimonials,
 letters, verses, biographies, and essays&#8212;were published not only
 in literary magazines, but also in professional and popular periodicals.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
 Mayakovsky's "comprehensibility," in particular, was created not only
 through general statements in criticism and editorials about his
 poetry, but also through presentations of and by "real" people who
 worked to overcome their initial difficulties in understanding his
 verse. Popular memoirs and testimonials cited real-life incidents
 that proved Mayakovsky was comprehensible to those who learned to
 read his work properly. They often stressed his role as a teacher on
 his lecture tours. In the context of the jubilee, proper performance
 indicated comprehension:

<b></b>

being able to read Mayakovsky's work well meant that one understood it.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
 The 1940 jubilee not only dictated the correct interpretation
 of Mayakovsky (Mayakovsky is comprehensible), but also, through
 incorporating "popular" voices and amateur literary productions,
 modeled a pattern of public response to Mayakovsky's poetry. This kind
 of model allowed jubilee organizers to acknowledge the average reader's
 difficulty in understanding the poetry while portraying comprehension
 as the ultimate result of reading aloud. This ideal of comprehension
 downplayed the importance of understanding the historical or poetic
 context of the poems themselves, stressing instead the public
 participation in events such as amateur conferences and readings
 arranged for the celebration. In this way, models of reading promoted
 in 1940 discouraged investigation of Mayakovsky's Futurist poetics,
 his polemics with other literary factions, his historical and poetic
 influences and allusions, or his use of autobiographical content. This
 approach to Mayakovsky's work separated the poet from the simultaneous
 repression of avant-garde and "formalist" poetry and the persecution
 of his friends and colleagues. This model of reading allowed the poet
 to be recontextualized into the new "realist" canon of Soviet poetry,
 as an heir to Pushkin.

<p>
The jubilee celebration's images and texts taught readers not only to
interpret Mayakovsky as a Soviet political poet, but also to regard him
as a heroic re, encouraging them to read literature and literary
res with the same framework applied to other spheres of cultural life.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
 The 1940 celebration promoted and circulated Mayakovsky as a symbol of
 Soviet achievements in literature equal to the industrial achievements
 touted in the Soviet press. To create Mayakovsky's new heroic Soviet
 image, many authors developed a new biography of Mayakovsky for the
 general reader, one that identified communist ideals in even his early
 work. These specific interpretation of Mayakovsky's life and works
 stressed his story as a model for common readers, a heroic narrative
 of Socialist Realism.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, numerous heroic biographies of notable people were
 published, many of them written according to a standard pattern,
 so that distinctions between fiction and biography began to
 disappear (<i>SN,</i> 122-3). Several structural components of the
 Socialist Realist Novel can be discerned in the jubilee images of
 Mayakovsky. First, Socialist Realist novels often create for the hero
 a surrogate "family" to replace the hero's natural family.
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
 Menzel has stressed the portrayal of Mayakovsky's idyllic childhood
 family in works such as Kal'ma's biography for young people, <i>Great
 Steps</i> (<i>Bol'shie shagi</i> [1940]). However, in Kal'ma's and
 other jubilee biographies, Mayakovsky's revolutionary work and "family"
 become more prominent than his real family, or his literary cohorts.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
 Certainly the family that Mayakovsky himself had defined as an adult in
 his suicide note was downplayed or eliminated in the official jubilee
 "commentary."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
 The official version of Mayakovsky's biography also reflects the second
 pattern that Clark identified as belonging to the Socialist Realist
 hero: the na&iuml;ve, spontaneous protagonist who gradually develops
 Soviet consciousness and rationality. The jubilee Mayakovsky, like the
 Socialist Realist hero, relied on a mentor, meetings with whom advance
 political consciousness. For Mayakovsky, Gorky becomes this mentor.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
 This is apparent in numerous publications, such as the memoirs of
 Gorky's second wife Maria Andreeva, which were published in the 13 April

<b></b>

1940 issue of <i>Pravda.</i> Andreeva glowingly describes Gorky's
recognition of the young Mayakovsky's talent and his work to help the
young poet publish; she also dwells on Mayakovsky's childlike personality
and his loving respect for Gorky.
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
 The jubilee thus recreated Mayakovsky as a Soviet classic in part
 by transferring the plots of Socialist Realism, and specifically the
 narrative of heroic development onto Mayakovsky and into the literary
 canon.

<p>
It is true that literary celebrations were concentrated in urban centers
and did not necessarily penetrate life in the countryside. Their effect
on the rural population, if any, is unclear.
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
 However, the 1940 Mayakovsky celebration did attempt to reach and
 involve the general reader; moreover, the portrayal of the celebration's
 effect on the general reader was itself a major goal. Perhaps the state
 promoted Mayakovsky not to cultivate a real love for his poetry, but to
 change the popular connotations that his name carried. Even if it did
 not love Mayakovsky or read his work after the jubilee, the general
 population would no longer think of him as only an incomprehensible
 Futurist. Readers would associate certain important Soviet phrases
 and roles with him and would interpret him in as a part of a literary
 tradition that they should value and celebrate. Popular involvement
 (and the description of it in newspapers and journals) would keep the
 intelligentsia from owning the celebration, while teaching the public
 to associate the forms of the literary celebration with Soviet culture.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Writers' Participation in the Mayakovsky Celebration
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In considering professional writers' participation in the 1940
Mayakovsky celebration, it is important to remember that Stalin had
defined opposition and indifference to the poet as a crime against the
state. Menzel has concluded that fear of punishment for this new "crime"
colors all writings about Mayakovsky after 1935.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
 Although it is true that this definition of a new "crime" particularly
 intimidated and threatened writers, scholarship on Mayakovsky after
 1935 was motivated by a complex mix of social and psychological
 factors that are hard to separate. These included fear of persecution,
 desire to publish, official compulsion, political and/or professional
 opportunism, and sincere regard for Mayakovsky's work. Because the
 official pronouncement on Mayakovsky indicated the offense to be avoided
 it is difficult to separate the fear generated by Stalin's statement
 from the atmosphere of fear that permeated all literary culture in
 the late 1930s.

<p>
Mayakovsky was perhaps able to save some individuals as well. Stalin
reportedly crossed Lili Brik's name off a list of arrestees, saying,
"We won't touch Mayakovsky's wife [sic]".
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
 Many writers with connections to Mayakovsky published memoirs and
 articles about him for the rest of their careers.
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
 It is quite possible that ties to Mayakovsky protected Vasilii Kamensky,
 Vladimir Pertsov, Shklovsky, and other writers at least to some extent
 during the Stalin era. The 1940 celebration occasioned many sincere
 works and presentations by former friends and colleagues who willingly
 participated in the festivities.
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
 Thus, Stalin's comments may have allowed some writers to remain
 professionally active to the extent that their ties with the poet
 may have

<b></b>

sheltered them or provided an outlet for their creative
activity. Mayakovsky's new Soviet value, it seems, could be more than a
symbol of state ideology; for some it could provide a measure of shelter
or creativity.

<p>
Although state control over all aspects of the celebration means that
Levitt's idea of a free neutral zone cannot apply to the Stalin period, it
is clear that the "special cultural space" of the 1930s celebrations did
present some opportunities for individual expression and for disagreement
within (though not outside of) official celebration discourse (<i>PC,</i>
115). Much valuable Mayakovsky scholarship was published in 1940, as well
as personal and sincere reflections on Mayakovsky and his place in Soviet
literature. However, the celebration itself both reinforced the state's
control over cultural value and contributed to the dissolution of the
intelligentsia as a separate group. The Mayakovsky celebration merged
literary and political value in the re of Mayakovsky, whose poetic
development was rewritten into a political evolution starting in his
childhood. In the 1930s Stalin had begun to use the term "intelligentsia"
to include party elite as well as intellectuals.
<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
 In the 1940 jubilee, the state continued to dissolve the intelligentsia
 while taking its authority to promote literary classics and determine
 literary value. The jubilee events for factory workers, amateur
 scholars, and schoolchildren, as well as the popular responses to
 Mayakovsky published in the press, diluted the specific meanings that
 could be attached to the celebration by the literary community.

<p>
Despite the imposition of state ideology, the Soviet jubilees did
provide opportunities to discuss literature that was not written in
the Socialist Realist mode. In the 1937 Pushkin celebration, Pushkin
at least could present a subject for textual analysis that was free
from Soviet ideology. Moreover, involvement in the jubilee enabled the
writers to at least maintain contact with a readership, sustaining the
memory of their names and perhaps their other works. A similar motivation
probably propelled the former friends and colleagues of Mayakovsky. Many
who wrote about Mayakovsky for the celebration pushed the boundaries of
acceptable jubilee literature. Shklovsky's <i>About Mayakovsky</i> (<i>O
Maiakovskom</i>) and Kamensky's <i>Life with Mayakovsky</i> (<i>Zhizn'
s Maiakovskim</i>) both use the occasion of the celebration to publish
jubilee texts grounded in their personal relationship with the poet.
<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
 In focusing on personal relationships in Mayakovsky's artistic,
 rather than political beginnings, they tried to situate their
 ideal of the "true" Mayakovsky within the boundaries of jubilee
 scholarship. Ambiguous participation in the 1930s literary celebrations
 has been acknowledged by Petrone, who has stressed the possibilities
 for unorthodox expression inherent in what she terms "celebration
 discourse," the literary, visual, and musical expressions dealing with
 the celebrations (<i>PC,</i> 7-8). Petrone's concept of "celebration
 discourse" highlights the potential for Aesopian language and multiple
 meanings in even state approved texts. The Russian tradition of
 "Aesopian language" permeated many published texts in the Stalin
 Era. Forms of Russian Aesopian language developed by writers through
 the years include hidden allusions, secret irony, allegories, and
 mockery disguised as overly effusive praise.
<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
 The very rigidity and ritualistic nature of public discourse may
 have enabled more Aesopian language and multiple meanings than would
 have been possible in a more individualized public sphere (<i>SN,</i>
 12-3). Writers could use Aesopian

<b></b>

language in the 1937 Pushkin celebration to incorporate a variety of
political and personal themes into even sanctioned jubilee texts and
rhetoric (<i>PC,</i> 141-8). Portraits of Pushkin as a persecuted poet
who advocated freedom, for example, conformed to the official Soviet
interpretation of Pushkin as a poet persecuted by a reactionary Tsarist
regime, while also suggesting contemporary situations of repression that
could not be mentioned directly.
<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
 These ambiguities in rhetoric demonstrate that the intelligentsia's
 participation in the Mayakovsky celebration did not simply mean
 conformity. Their texts could raise similarly suggestive criticisms
 while seemingly expressing the correct attitude towards the Soviet
 "classic." One memoir, published in <i>Literaturnyi Sovremennik</i>
 by Rita Rait, begins with what seems to be a general reference to
 the passage of time (a conventional opening for a memoir): "Time,
 as is well known, wipes away penciled notations, eats up ink, yellows
 photographs with years, breaks old letters along the folds, and <i>burns
 shreds of diaries in the stove</i>" [emphasis added].
<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
 The memoirist's reference to time's disintegrating effect on words and
 photographs ends on an action that does not naturally result from the
 passage of time: the burning of diaries. This phrase would no doubt
 evoke the burning of letters, diaries, and other papers during the
 purges to destroy evidence that might be found and used against an
 arrested person or his/her friends by the secret police. The jubilee
 memoir, it seems, could allude to the present in its framing of the
 past, referring indirectly to Stalin's purges and their effect on
 literary texts. The institution of the literary celebration could be
 a forum for politically ambiguous or subversive allusions not only in
 jubilee texts, but also in performances and public settings. Nadezhda
 Mandelstam remembers the private meanings shared by Osip Mandelstam and
 the director Yakhontov in Voronezh, as Yakhontov performed a one-man
 show he had created about Mayakovsky and Pushkin:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In a turn entitled "Traveling Poets" he [Yakhontov] read passages from
Pushkin's "Journey to Erzrum" [sic] and from Mayakovsky in such a way
as to suggest that poets could travel abroad only under the Soviet
regime. The audience reacted with total indifference: nobody then
imagined that anybody could travel abroad and as they left at the
end of this baffling evening, the only comment they could manage was
"That's what comes from living too well." At one point he would recite
from Mayakovsky's poem about the "Soviet Passport" and, taking his own
identity papers from his pocket, brandish them in front of the audience,
looking all the time straight at M. [Osip Mandelstam]. M. took his
brand-new papers out of his pocket and they exchanged knowing glances. The
authorities would have taken a very poor view of such antics, but they
are very literal-minded, and there were no instructions to cover cases
of this kind.
<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As sanctioned events with a clearly acceptable purpose, jubilees provided
rare opportunities for public gathering and performance of the type
N. Mandelstam mentions. In this context Yakhontov's play was able to
suggest a private context in a public setting, carrying a special meaning
to certain participants.
<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
 The link between Mayakovsky and Pushkin could also allude to the
 contemporary persecution of poets in the USSR. Jubilee events and texts
 could therefore be ambiguous, conveying unsanctioned meanings while
 seemingly conforming to official political and ideological demands.

<b></b>

<p>
By participating in the literary celebrations writers could maintain
relationships with a readership, and promote certain roles or ideals
of authorship. Anna Akhmatova, for example, after years of enforced
silence, managed to perform her verse, "Mayakovsky in 1913," publicly
for a Mayakovsky jubilee event held in Leningrad.
<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>
 Furthermore, jubilee writings, while preserving the official Soviet
 value that their commentary supported, sometimes used themes and
 narrative forms that called into question the commentary conventions
 themselves. The most notorious example of this is Shklovsky's <i>About
 Mayakovsky</i>; Shklovsky violated thematic expectations by discussing
 Mayakovsky's Futurist period at length and highlighting his connections
 to Futurism (<i>MR,</i> 174-5). However, he also violated generic
 expectations by writing a book that could not easily be classified as
 either "memoir" (a text that could be evaluated as "fact" or personal
 reminiscence), or "biography" (a genre that in this period required
 an impersonal narrative voice and formulaic plot). Shklovsky used the
 jubilee volume about Mayakovsky to actively engage with expectations
 of jubilee texts, specifically biographies. His book shows how the
 Mayakovsky jubilee could be made into a forum for challenging the
 structure of commentary that it sanctioned and created.

Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Understanding Mayakovsky's canonization as a cultural process clarifies
how the ideal of Soviet literature transformed the res of literary
modernism. It is all the more important because the mechanisms of the
Soviet poetic canon in the 1930s are still poorly understood. The "poet
function" of Socialist Realism has yet to be studied in detail.
<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
 Unlike the prose canon, the Socialist Realist canon for poetry depended
 on a set of model poets. Critical studies of this canon, however, have
 approached it as a selection of model texts. The recent resurgence of
 critical interest in Socialist Realism and Stalinist culture of the
 1930s has largely neglected the role of the poet and poetry, focusing
 instead on the novel as the primary Socialist realist genre.
<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
 Mayakovsky's canonization demonstrates both the interconnectedness
 of poetry and prose (as prose narratives were applied to Mayakovsky's
 own biography) and the uniqueness of poetry and the role of the poet,
 as opposed to the prose writer, in this period. It is clear from the
 rhetoric of celebrations devoted to Pushkin and Mayakovsky in the
 1930s, as well as the numerous literary and visual representations of
 the poet in this period, that the poet, not the poem, is the basis for
 the Socialist Realist poetic canon. This canon was based upon a master
 narrative of evolution in literary history embodied in a succession
 of heroic poet-res. Mayakovsky's biography, like Pushkin's,
 reflected an archetypal biographical narrative that confirmed his
 status in the canon.

<p>
Far from being the "background" for the larger changes in literature of
the 1930s, literary jubilees created the new ideal of the Soviet classic
poet and modeled the ways that the public was meant to interact with and
celebrate the classic poets. The Mayakovsky celebration of 1940 created
the first coherent Soviet commentary on Mayakovsky, and involved both
intellectuals and the public in creating and revising the poet's persona
and legacy. It demonstrates that Mayakovsky's "canonization" must

<b></b>

be understood as more than simply the imposition of state values upon a
dead poet. The state used the jubilee to enlist the literary community
in revising the popular image of Mayakovsky. The "commentary" created
by the jubilee employed both text and event, and used materials for
both specialists and general readers. It promoted a cohesive narrative
biography, character, and genealogy, and it institutionalized conventions
to recreate and support the values these images of the poet contained. The
Mayakovsky celebration of 1940 introduced the formulae that would be
used for Mayakovsky celebrations in subsequent years. On a more basic
level, it established the ways in which the public was meant to interact
with the Soviet classic poet, defining the genres of texts, events,
and languages that would be applied in future decades.

Birgit Menzel notes that A. Mekhlis, the head editor of <i>Pravda,</i>
attempted to weaken Stalin's statement by removing the superlative. The
phrase as reproduced in this issue of <i>Pravda</i> called Mayakovsky
"the best, talented poet of our Soviet epoch" ("luchshii, talantlivyi poet
nashei sovetskoi epokhi"). In the 17 December issue of <i>Pravda,</i>
and in all subsequent citations of this quotation, the superlative
"most talented" ("talantliveishii") returns. See Birgit Menzel,
<i>V. V. Majakovskij und seine Rezeption in der Sowjetunion l930-54,</i>
(Berlin: Harrassowitz Verlag, 1992), 144-5; hereafter abbreviated as

"Vladimir Maiakovskii," <i>Pravda,</i> 5 December 1935, 4. Stalin was
responding to a private letter from Lili Brik protesting the neglect
of Mayakovsky's legacy. Some recent scholars have questioned the
extent to which Brik's complaints were justified. Although publishing
res and critical articles suggest that Mayakovsky was not as
neglected as Brik implied, only certain works were being published
in any quantity. For yearly print run tallies, see A. Ezerskaia,
"Maiakovskii v bibliotekakh," <i>Krasnyi bibliotekar'</i> 2 :
3-16. This could mean that Brik's letter was a preemptive strike rather
than a complaint about present conditions, an act meant to protect
the Briks from future persecution. Sundaram has supported this view,
and has suggested that the canonization of Mayakovsky was spurred not by
Brik's personal pleas so much as by Stalin's need for a poet-Stakhanovite
re, a "revolutionary romantic" hero ("MC," 141-3). The <i>Pravda</i>
article, however, addresses almost point-for-point the main complaints
in Brik's letter. It decries the lack of popular editions of his works,
the lack of a museum and library in his former residence, and the
removal of his <i>Vladimir Ilich Lenin</i> and <i>Good!</i> from school
curriculums. The text of Brik's letter has been published several times
in recent years: see Andrei Artizov and Oleg Naumov, comps., <i>Vlast'

Lazar Fleischman interprets Stalin's remark as a great relief for
Pasternak, because it removed him from the difficult and dangerous
responsibility of being a <i>Soviet</i> poet. See Lazar Fleischman,
<i>Boris Pasternak: the Poet and his Politics</i> (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1990), 193. Pasternak's subsequent letter to
Stalin supports this interpretation: "Recently . . . I had begun to be
suspected of serious artistic power. Now, after you placed Mayakovsky
in the first position, this suspicion is lifted from me, and with a
light heart I can live and work as before" (<i>VKI,</i> 275). See also
Pasternak's poem, "To My Liking is the Obstinate Habit" ("Mne po dushe
stroptivyi norov"), in <i>Izvestiia,</i> 1 (January 1936), in which he
contrasts the "Steel poet" and another "endlessly small" poet. (For this
point, and more on Pasternak's response to Stalin, see <i>MR,</i> 145-6.)

Mayakovsky, <i>The Bedbug and Selected Poems,</i> trans. Max Hayward and
George Reavey, ed. Patricia Blake (Bloomington: Indiana University Press,
1975), 9-50. Both of these works end with melancholy acknowledgments of
Mayakovsky's Soviet afterlife and affirmations that this was counter to
his wishes and works. Blake's title refers to Pasternak, making her moral
perspective clear. Svetlana Boym's "The Death of the Revolutionary Poet"
departs from this trend in exploring the myths of the revolutionary poet
that Mayakovsky cultivated in his poetry and that proliferated after his
death. Boym stresses the recurring need for critics to uncover the "real"
Mayakovsky under the Soviet fa&ccedil;ade but she is not concerned with
the concrete cultural mechanisms of canonization. See Svetlana Boym,
"The Death of the Revolutionary Poet," in <i>Death in Quotation Marks:

the Death of Vladimir Mayakovsky: A New Version of the Tragic Events,

was murdered by the Soviet secret police. See also the recent popular
biographies of Mayakovsky by A. Mikhailov: <i>Tochka puli v kontse</i>

a very negative view of the Briks (occasionally veering into potential
anti-Semitism or personal attack). See for example Vladimir Diadichev,

Menzel and Sundaram have begun to critically examine Mayakovsky's
Soviet myth. After a thematic discussion of Mayakovsky's work, Menzel
chronologically traces his reception in the Stalin period, focusing
on four points of reception: 1935, 1940, 1945, and 1954. Sundaram
traces Mayakovsky's "Soviet myth" from the 1920s to the post-Soviet
reconsideration of Mayakovsky in the early 1990s. In part, both authors
are responding to the notorious thesis by Boris Groys that posits an
essential continuity between the Russian avant-garde and the later
Stalinist culture of Socialist Realism. See Boris Groys, <i>The Total
Art of Stalinism,</i> trans. Charles Rougle, (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
University Press, 1992), originally published as <i>Gesamtkunstwerk
Stalin: die Gespaltene Kultur in der Sowjetunion,</i> (M&uuml;nchen,
1988). Sundaram dissents from what she sees as Menzel's suggestion of a
"contradictory but nevertheless essential continuity between aspects of
the left avant-garde and Socialist Realism" that ultimately supports
Groys' thesis ("MC," 5). She rightly argues that "reception" is not
an appropriate concept for the state's control and promotion of the
"Mayakovsky legend." Despite their differences, both authors trace
Mayakovsky's Soviet image through the decades.

Katerina Clark has noted that during the Stalin period official directives
did not simply oppose alternatives posited by intellectuals but usually
endorsed one position in a currently raging debate. See Katerina
Clark, <i>Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution</i> (Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995), 279. Menzel and Sundaram have
discussed this debate in more detail; see <i>MR,</i> 130-3 and "MC,"
124-31. Sundaram discusses Nikolai Bukharin's address about Mayakovsky
as a balanced, admiring appraisal, and deems the Writer's Congress to be
"the last genuine public debate about Mayakovsky in an official forum
until the late 1980s" ("MC," 126).

would come back to haunt Bukharin, as he and most former RAPP members

acceptance of the avant-garde. Paradoxically, however, Mayakovsky's
canonization was accompanied by the suppression of his literary style

through Illustrated Editions of the 18th Century</i> (Montreal:

studies of literary value and canon formation, which demonstrate how
canonizing authorities try to naturalize the existence of a certain set
of classics as well as promote a certain set of values. See John Guillory,

Referring to textual commentaries on "classic" texts, Iuri Streidter
suggests that critical commentaries not only define the canonized text
but necessarily react to previous commentaries. See Iuri Streidter,
<i>Literary Structure, Evolution, and Value</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard
University Press, l989), 203-4. The idea of "commentary" that I put
forth in this article includes not just criticism but events (exhibits,
conferences, skits) and printed genres (criticism, biography, fiction,
poetry) that perpetuate a view of the author as classic for a given
audience. "Commentary" in this sense is broader then Striedter's usage,
and applies not to a work, but to the author as a cultural re. It
refers not simply to critical response, but to a defining set of texts,
events, and practices that create and sustain value.

Karen Petrone has made this point in reference to the 1937 Pushkin
celebration; however, it must extend to other literary celebrations as
well. Petrone has stated that the Pushkin Centennial of 1937 "stood at
the crossroads of contradictory discourses of inclusion and exclusion, of
celebration and terror." Karen Petrone, <i>"Life has Become More Joyous,

as well as cultural res, see Fitzpatrick, <i>Everyday Stalinism,</i>

See, for example, the numerous reports and testimonials about amateur
Pushkin conferences related to the jubilee that were published in Soviet
newspapers in 1936-37. These have been discussed in part by Petrone;
see <i>PC,</i> 116-20. Newspapers from March and April 1940 repeatedly
describe the joyous preparations of a variety of workers groups, schools,
and citizens reading groups for the Mayakovsky celebration.

The distinction between classic authors and classic texts is often
blurred or ignored in critical discussions of literary canons. This is
particularly important in the Russian context, because the Russian
language itself distinguishes between the classic text and the
classic author. Unlike English, the Russian language has specific
terms that distinguish between <i>klassik</i> (a classic author) and
<i>klassika</i> (classic texts). These two separate concepts have a
complex relationship; most, but not all <i>klassika</i> are written
by a <i>klassik</i>. However, some are not: the <i>Igor Tale,</i>
for instance. An author with a biography is not a required element
of <i>klassika</i>. Moreover, not all texts written by a Russian
<i>klassik</i> are necessarily considered <i>klassika</i>, such as
Gogol's <i>Selected Passages from a Correspondence with Friends,</i>
or Lermontov's pre-1837 poetry.

of this holiday in the Soviet Union unfurled before the proletariat the
great significance of Goethe's work for the culture of humanity" .

persons into collective abstractions by inducing action, knowledge and

<p>
<a name="FOOT40" href="#REF40">40</a>.
Several jubilee texts both represent and model transformation explicitly
in portrayals of Mayakovsky's readings. In one jubilee poem depicting
Mayakovsky's performance of his verse, for example, the crowd is
initially presented as a hostile, inarticulate beast. Mayakovsky calms,
transforms, and unifies the audience, giving the power of speech
and understanding. The crowd leaves this performance discussing the
poems amongst themselves. These poems suggest to readers that, like
the revolution, Mayakovsky's readings both educated and humanized the
public. It is implied that these jubilee poems about Mayakovsky can
do the same for the reader in 1940. See Yaroslav Smeliakov, "Vladimir
Maiakovskii," <i>Znamia</i> 4-5 : 121-2.

<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
Handelman's typology does help to illustrate the differences between
Soviet and pre-revolutionary celebrations, but it is only of limited
usefulness in studying how Soviet celebrations worked. He explicitly
states that his typology cannot help define the boundaries of a particular
event, diachronic changes in an event over time, emotional effects
of the event on participants, or relations between different types of
events. See <i>MM,</i> 58. A wider notion of "commentary" allows us to
consider aspects neglected by Handelman's scheme: relationships between
themes, forms, and authors that were part of both published sources
and jubilee events. Future study of the commentary on Mayakovsky will
require including materials published during the anniversary year,
alongside the events that made up the jubilee proper.

The concept of "culturedness" could thus incorporate cultural literacy
into a new value system in a way that mitigated the impression that
the literary classics were part of suspect bourgeois culture. On the
shifting concept of this ideal, and how it could be a tool for both
shaping behavior and leveling social classes, see Catriona Kelly and
Vadim Volkov, "Directed Desires: Kul'turnost' and Consumption," in
<i>Constructing Russian Culture in an Age of Revolution 1881-1940,</i>
ed. Catriona Kelly and David Shepherd (New York: Oxford University Press),
291-314. On "culturism" see Jeffery Brooks, <i>When Russia Learned
to Read: Literacy and Popular Literature 1861-1917,</i> (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1985), 317-21. Also see Brooks's source
for the term: Edwin Reischauer and John K. Fairbank's <i>East Asia:
The Great Tradition</i> (Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1960), 293. The
Imperial Government's official Pushkin celebration of 1899 can be seen
as a similar, but much more limited attempt to realign this Russian
culturism with official nationality. Soviet celebrations were much more
comprehensive than Imperial Russian celebrations in making culturism
support the official regime.

Though it did not set up and support a <i>Soviet</i> literary canon until
the 1930s, the government had long before moved to control the literary
classics. The Council of People's Commissars decreed on 11 January 1918
that a list of Russian classics were to be published only by the state
publishing agency. Publishing popular editions of the classics then
received top priority. See Maurice Friedberg, <i>Russian Classics in

This can be seen in particular in the many articles on the theme

See Sergei Tregub, "Solntse sovetskoi poezii" ["The Sun of Soviet
Poetry"], <i>Smena</i> 4 : 9-10. The title of Tregub's 1940 article
references the lone death notice for Pushkin published in 1837 in the
literary supplement to the journal <i>Russkii Invalid,</i> which had
declared simply "the Sun of Russian poetry has set." The quotation
highlights the inherent ambiguities in the state's promotion of the
two poets. Many writers in the years immediately after Mayakovsky's
suicide in 1930 had interpreted his death as a symbolic recurrence of
Pushkin's death, an expression of the "poet's fate" in Russia. Roman
Jakobson made this connection in the well-known article, "On a Generation
that Squandered its Poets" ["O pokolenii, rastrativshem svoikh poetov"]
. Pasternak's poem "The Death of the Poet"  also referenced
the connection, its intertextual allusion to Lermontov's verse indicting
society for Pushkin's 1837 death by dueling. In declaring Mayakovsky
the "Sun of Soviet Poetry," Tregub (perhaps intentionally) raises the
underlying issue of the poet's death in a time of autocracy, a subject
with less than positive connotations for the Soviet government in
the 1930s.

<p>
<a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>.
Between December 1935 and February 1937, at least ten articles were

See <i>PC,</i> 10-1. In fact, I would stress that literary celebrations
were the main source of the new ideal of Soviet "high" culture
as a unified tradition incorporating all the Soviet republics,
but of course led by Russian literary tradition. See also Petrone's
discussion of the 1937 Pushkin celebration's symbolic representation
of the brother republics embracing Pushkin as part of their "native"
tradition (<i>PC,</i> 129-31). National unity was also represented by
the parallel events held for the literary res of other republics.

Alekseeva discusses one jubilee exhibit that was never opened, despite

ultimately impossible to reconcile with the documentary materials (photos,
manuscripts, letters) that an exhibition required. See "DLS," 186.

The extent to which the public believed the rhetoric of the Mayakovsky
celebration is unclear. The resolution of this question in regards
to the massive cultural undertaking of jubilees must involve Slavoj
&#157;Zi&#157;zek's recent position that the "culture industry"
of the type described by Adorno does not exist in totalitarian
societies, whose regimes do not intend to cultivate actual belief in
the ruling ideology. i ek suggests that totalitarian regimes operate on
"cynical reason," which acknowledges and exists in the gap between the
ideological mask of the regime and the reality. "Cynical reason," in
&#157;Zi&#157;zek's formulation, does not expect to create the illusion
of truth; instead it uses "extra-ideological violence and the promise
of gain" to secure its subject's obedience. Applying "cynical reason"
to institutions like the Mayakovsky celebration might suggest that it
was not meant to inculcate belief in the official Mayakovsky myth, but
was merely a means to secure complicity in the system that allowed the
state to dictate literary and cultural worth, production of texts, and
literary value. &#157;Zi&#157;zek's theory, however, does not account
for the potential for variation, the possibility that the "industry"
of the celebration was to present truth to some, and complicity to
others. However, his theory does suggest the possibility that the
"mass inculcation of Mayakovsky into the national consciousness" (as
Alekseeva phrased it) was not necessarily the celebration organizers'
main goal. This issue cannot be resolved here, but suggests the need for
future study of the literary celebration. See Slavoj &#157;Zi&#157;zek,
"How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?" in <i>Mapping Ideology,</i> ed. Slavoj
&#157;Zi&#157;zek, (London: Verso, 1994), 212-3.

Published memoirs and testimonials often describe a citizen overcoming
a previous dislike or misunderstanding of the poet's work. The numerous
amateur conferences no doubt were intended to support the idea of public
reading as a way to "comprehend" Mayakovsky or to display one's own
erudition. See the account of one technician, N. Progrov, published in
a newspaper article:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have read almost all of Mayakovsky's works. In the beginning, I
understood them with difficulty, because I didn't know how to read. Then I
began to practice reading aloud and gradually assimilated his style. I was
convinced, that in each poem of Mayakovsky's, even a small one, there is
a deep meaning. Now Mayakovsky is my very favorite poet. I have acquired
a full collection of his works. I read through them over and over again.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Not long ago I met a man who, having never read Mayakovsky's poetry,
began to vehemently judge it "incomprehensible." Of course, this is
nonsense. Mayakovsky is comprehensible to all who know how to read
thoughtfully and not rush through the book at a gallop. I once read to
my comrades, the workers of our factory, the poem about Ivan Kozyrev,
about Nette, about the Soviet passport. They asked me to read more and
more . . .

A similar point is made by Menzel, who finds characteristics of the
Socialist Realist hero in several of the biographical texts published in
1940 (see <i>MR,</i> 163-71). More specifically, I would argue that the
jubilee texts and events not only assigned Socialist Realist character
traits to Mayakovsky, but produced a biographical narrative that draws
on the "master plot" of Socialist Realism that Katerina Clark outlined in
her definitive study <i>The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual</i> (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1981); hereafter abbreviated as <i>SN.</i>
This <i>narrative</i> of evolution from "spontaneity" to "consciousness"
is the ultimate pattern to which Mayakovsky's biography is subjugated;
the literary celebration's traditional focus on the author's biography
cultivated this model most effectively. The jubilee created a heroic
narrative for Mayakovsky as an evolution in revolutionary consciousness
manifested in meetings with mentor res that always resulted in more
profound, revolutionary creative activity. I have written about this in
my dissertation: "Creating the First Classic Poet of Socialist Realism:
Mayakovsky as a Subject of 'Celebration Culture' 1935-1940" (University
of Chicago, 2002).

Mayakovsky did underground work for the communist party in Moscow as a
juvenile in 1908-10 and was imprisoned twice. He abandoned party work
before beginning his poetic career with the "Cubo-Futurist" group in
1912. He never belonged to the party as an adult. His early years of party
work were, of course, emphasized in 1940 as the genesis of his supposed
"evolution toward communism."

relationship between the two, see <i>MR,</i> 169-70. Menzel does not
see this relationship as part of the Socialist Realist novelization
of Mayakovsky's biography, but as part of the larger project to link
Mayakovsky to Soviet authorities such as Lenin, Stalin, and Gorky.

Maria Andreeva, "Iz vospominanii" ["From My Memories"], <i>Pravda</i>
(13 April 1940): 4. These jubilee texts simplify a relationship not
always so cordial. Lili Brik later suggested directly that Mayakovsky's
relationship with Gorky was misrepresented in Soviet criticism (<i>MR,</i>
170). See also Katanian, <i>Lilia Brik,</i> 32-4; Katanian describes
how Mayakovsky discovered that Gorky had spread unfounded rumors that
Mayakovsky had given a young girl syphilis and then blackmailed her
parents. This incident and Mayakovsky's subsequent falling-out with Gorky
are never cited in jubilee articles. Viktor Shklovsky seems to be the only
jubilee writer who mentioned this incident and its aftermath. See Viktor
Shklovsky, <i>O Maiakovskom</i> [<i>About Mayakovsky</i>; published in
English as <i>Mayakovsky and his Circle,</i> trans. Lily Feiler (New York:
Dodd, Mead, 1972)], (Moscow: Sovetskii Pisatel', 1940), 117-8.

The distance between urban and rural Soviet life has been revealingly
demonstrated by Veronica Gorres, Natalia Korenevskaia, and Thomas
Lahusen, the editors of <i>Intimacy and Terror.</i> By juxtaposing
quotations from the newspaper <i>Izvestiia</i> with diary entries
written by a peasant collective farm worker, this volume effectively
shows how the countryside operated with a different set of concerns,
priorities, and timetables than city life. The Pushkin celebration that
filled the pages of <i>Izvestiia</i> in 1937 leaves no trace in the farm
worker's diary. See <i>Intimacy and Terror,</i> ed. Veronica Gorres,
Natalia Korenevskaia, and Thomas Lahusen, trans. Carol Flath (New York:
The New Press, 1995).

<i>MR,</i> 135. Chertok suggests that this article created a "new
category of crime" ("<i>novyi sostav prestupleniia</i>"); he points out
that Stalin directed his reply not to Brik herself, but to Ezhov, the
head of the secret police, suggesting the potential punishment for this
new "crime." See Simon Chertok, <i>Posledniaia liubov Maiakovskogo</i>
[<i>Mayakovsky's Last Love</i>], (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Ermitazh, 1983),
39. An article titled "Indifference" ("Bezrazlichie") published in 1937
makes the threat implied in the statement quite explicit:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There is no doubt that members of the Writer's Union Committee of the
Byelorussian republic . . . remember well the words of comrade Stalin
about Mayakovsky. They are well acquainted with not only the high
evaluation which comrade Stalin gave Mayakovsky, but also the words
stating that indifference to Mayakovsky's memory and his works is a
crime. However, it is one thing to remember, and another to understand
that they must make practical conclusions from these words . . .

Quoted in Katanian, <i>Lilia Brik,</i> 103. Katanian quotes Roy Medvedev's
memoirs published in the journal <i>Kontinent.</i> Sundaram quotes this
same passage, noting that many of the Briks' enemies attributed their
survival of the purges to their close relationships with the secret
police. See "MC," 160-1. It seems equally likely that their arrest might
have tainted the reputation of the State Poet.

Menzel's survey of work about Mayakovsky after 1935 shows the number of
texts published by his former colleagues, thus indicating that the state
approval of Mayakovsky's work suggested (or compelled) relatively safe
avenues of literary activity.

Petrone notes that a film of Pushkin's "A Journey to Arzrum" was released
in 1937 and surely suggested Aesopian meanings to its audience, with its
themes of a persecuted poet longing to leave the country (<i>PC,</i> 182).

Pushkin"], <i>Literaturnyi Sovremennik</i> 4 : 113. The phrase "as
is well known" (<i>kak izvestno</i>) is also perhaps significant here,
as it was a familiar phrase of Stalin's, generally used to introduce
statements of doctrine, policy, or ideology that were not "well known"
at all.

Several articles by Yakhontov were published in 1936-40 about this
show. Yakhontov was a famous actor and theater director, and a popular
performer of Mayakovsky's verse through the 1930s; he is listed on
several programs for Mayakovsky jubilee events.

Menzel notes that Akhmatova published this poem after years of being
unable to publish work; see <i>MR,</i> 150. However, Akhmatova had
published scholarship for the Pushkin celebration in 1937; in 1940 she
published this poem in <i>Maiakovskomu</i> [<i>To Mayakovsky</i>], as
well as a volume of her own poetry, <i>Iz shesti knig</i> [<i>From Six
Books</i>]. The door to publication may have been opened for Akhmatova
before the celebration. It is clear, however, that this poem enabled her
first public performance for years, suggesting that the jubilee allowed
Akhmatova to reconnect with an audience.

The term "poet-function" is adapted from Michel Foucault's well-known
concept of "author-function." See Michel Foucault, "What is an
Author?" trans. Donald F. Bouchard and Sherry Simon, in <i>Language,
Counter-Memory, Practice,</i> ed. Donald F. Bouchard, (Ithaca, N.Y.:
Cornell University Press, 1977), 124-7. For another use of this concept
to explore the development of a Russian classic, see "GR," 167-9.

See <i>SN</i> and Hans G&uuml;nther, "Zhiznennye fazy sotsrealisticheskogo
kanona"["Life Phases of the Socialist Realist Canon"], in
<i>Sotsrealisticheskii kanon,</i> (St. Petersburg: Akademicheskii proekt,
2000), 281-9. G&uuml;nther suggests that there are two types of canons:
one of texts (examples) and one "regularizing canon" in which the norms
for text production are defined. Though acknowledging the primary
role of institutions in the canonization process, G&uuml;nther does
not consider the role of literary and cultural institutions, or the
individual writer. Both Clark and G&uuml;nther's theoretical discussions
of Socialist Realism pointedly omit poetry.
