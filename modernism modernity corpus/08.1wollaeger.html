When Helen and Ridley Ambrose jostle their way through London's narrow
streets toward a ship bound for South America in the opening pages
of Virginia Woolf's <I>The Voyage Out</I>, Ridley momentarily becomes
"entangled . . . with a man selling picture postcards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 When Rachel Vinrace, another passenger on board the <I>Euphrosyne</I>,
 attempts to recall London life while strolling through a South American
 town, she begins by acknowledging the kind of entanglement Ridley
 tries to leave behind: "First there are men selling picture postcards"
 (<I>VO</I>, 91). It makes sense that Rachel's effort to think her way
 back into England should begin with the selling of postcards, for by
 1915 a craze for picture postcards had made them a prominent feature of
 everyday life. The first picture postcards apparently emanated from the
 Paris Exhibition of 1889, and many more were produced in England for such
 large-scale exhibitions as London's Imperial International Exhibition in
 1909 and the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924. This essay
 situates the story of Rachel's education within the cultural politics
 propagated by colonial postcards and imperial exhibitions, and argues
 that the novel's culminating scene of cross-cultural encounter uses
 race to address issues of gender and sexuality that are part of Rachel's
 baggage on her voyage out of England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Written during the so-called golden age of picture postcards, <I>The
Voyage Out</I> follows Rachel up the Amazon in search of a place
"where none but natives had ever trod" (<I>VO</I>, 225). What she
discovers instead is the difficulty of disentangling herself from a
characteristically modern form of cultural expression.

<B></B>

Thanks in part to new postal regulations, postcards circulated
in unprecedented numbers in England at the turn of the century,
and millions more were sent home by English travelers exploring the
boundaries of empire. Far from mere exotic throwaways, widely-collected
colonial postcards contributed to imperial stereotyping by disseminating
primitivist images of indigenous peoples during the most jingoistic
period of England's global dominance. Images of the native other were
also imprinted onto the English imagination by domestic postcards printed
for imperial exhibitions. Underlying the early-century vogue for picture
postcards, as well as the concomitant resurgence of imperial romance,
was a desire for authenticity attached to exotic locales. In a historical
moment increasingly self-conscious about the inescapably mediated nature
of reality, colonial postcards satisfied the desire for the authentic
(i.e., the seemingly immediate) even as their cataloging of exotic images
contributed to the English sense that the realm of the unexplored was
rapidly shrinking.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The process of globalization in the early twentieth century was not
yet far enough along to require the late-century coinage "globality" to
describe the economic integration of a wholly interconnected world. But
<I>The Voyage Out</I> registers an impression of impending globality by
linking the crowded banks of the Thames to the exotic streets of Santa
Marina through the ubiquity of the picture postcard: Ridley's literal
entanglement becomes Rachel's imagined one. Part <I>Bildungsroman</I>,
part imperial romance, Woolf's first novel sometimes res Rachel's
journey to South America as an attempt to voyage out of culture and
history altogether, but her engagement to Terence Hewet while traveling
up the Amazon in effect turns the South American journey into a trip back
into England. Given that Woolf never set foot in South America, it is
not surprising that the mossy path running alongside the Amazon begins
to resemble "a drive in an English forest" or that her description of
native women up the Amazon <I></I>appears to be informed by the popular
ethnography of colonial postcards and imperial exhibitions (<I>VO</I>,
257). Richard Dalloway, who along with his wife Clarissa makes his first
appearance in <I>The Voyage Out</I>, finds the spread of Englishness
deeply satisfying: the "unity of aim, of dominion, of progress"
spreading under the Union Jack, he tells Rachel, makes all the world
a stage for British power (<I>VO</I>, 57). Although Rachel feels "her
small world becoming wonderfully enlarged" under Richard's influence,
her subsequent encounter with the indigenous women suggests that her
world actually remains quite small: as if transplanted from the pitch
at Wembley, this scene of ethnographic exhibition reproduces the complex
dynamics of spectatorship that obtains when one's only real knowledge of
the other comes from looking at picture postcards or people on display
(<I>VO</I>, 75).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Voyage Out</I> has been understood as a straightforward critique
of empire, but Woolf's pivotal scene upriver reveals a more complicated
meditation on the potential entanglement of Englishwomen in the norms
of gender, sex, and race that empire underwrites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Rachel's initiation into Richard's imperial Englishness raises an
 issue that Woolf would pose more pointedly in <I>Three Guineas</I>
 in connection with new economic opportunities for women: "how can we
 enter the professions and yet remain civilized human beings?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Inasmuch as a woman's success in "the patriarchal system"

<B></B>

runs the risk that "the words 'For God and the Empire' will . . . be
written, like the address on a dog-collar, round your neck," Woolf
worries that Englishwomen already colonized under patriarchy "like
slaves in a harem" may become colonizers in their turn as they follow
"the procession . . . of educated men" into the public sphere (<I>TG</I>,
64, 74, 70). Although Woolf's critique of war and empire in <I>Three
Guineas</I> is more univocal and forceful than the implicit critique
worked out in Rachel's story, <I>The Voyage Out</I> probes more deeply
into the gap between gendered and racial identities that the polemical
invocation of "slaves in a harem" obscures. For Woolf's struggle with
racial difference in her first novel's culminating scene of exhibition
brings her to the brink of acknowledging the imperial grounding of her
own whiteness, and the depth of her affective engagement makes race a
crucial feature of her work, for the first and last time.

Much like the vogue for posters that hit London and Europe at the turn
of the century, picture postcards, first used in Great Britain in the
1890s, quickly became highly prized objects for English collectors and
the general public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 An astonishing range of cards suffused all levels of culture: images
 of new technology, photos of actresses, Boer War battle commemorations,
 novelty cards, and popular crazes from ping-pong to roller skating. The
 state, along with political groups of various stripes, quickly found
 a new agent of propaganda, and topical postcards began to enter
 into debates about suffrage, tariff reform, and imperial policy. The
 advertising industry capitalized on the new form so effectively that by
 1903 a man sending a South African postcard of an African woman washing
 a young child with the caption "O dirty boy!" to his sister on the Isle
 of Wight suggested it would be "a very good adv. for Pears Soap/you ought
 to send it to the firm"(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The postcard evinces not only the deep link established by the turn of
 the century between advertising and postcards, but also the degree to
 which both, spreading along paths cut by empire, were mediating English
 views of the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This new mass cultural form spread so quickly owing in part to changes
in British and international postal regulations. In 1899 British postal
regulations permitted the standard-sized card already used in Europe to
circulate freely, and a special postal rate of one halfpenny for domestic
delivery encouraged Edwardians to send postcards on the slightest pretext:
"'Hope to be in time for tea this afternoon!'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Just as journals arose around the poster phenomenon, so monthly
 publications such as <I>The Picture Postcard &amp; Collector's
 Chronicle</I> (1900-1907) and <I>The Postcard Connoisseur for
 Postcard Collectors</I>  sprang up to serve the needs of avid
 collectors. "During the quarter of a century that preceded the Great
 War in 1914," according to one historian of the postcard, "it would
 have been hard to find anyone who did not buy postcards from genuine
 pleasure. People preserved them carefully in their albums, or they
 posted them to their friends or relations, in the expectation of
 receiving others in return."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Royalty was more cautious yet not immune: Queen Victoria asked a relative
to compile an album for her.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not everyone was pleased with this sudden suffusion of images. As in
contemporary fears about the rise of consumer culture, women in particular
were red as both victims and carriers of a new cultural disease.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 An article in the <I>Standard</I> in 1899 observes dryly that "The
 illustrated postcard craze, like the influenza, has spread to these
 islands from the Continent, where it has been raging with considerable
 severity. Sporadic cases have occurred in Britain. Young ladies who have
 escaped the philatelic infection or wearied of collecting Christmas
 cards, have been known to fill albums with missives of this kind from
 friends abroad" (quoted in <I>PPO</I>, 60). A few years later the
 <I>Glasgow Evening News</I> worried that "In ten years Europe will
 be buried beneath picture postcards." As if to confirm these fears,
 a drawing in the <I>Illustrated London News</I> (October 16, 1909)
 shows Germans in an open-air restaurant buying cards for immediate
 posting from a postman with a letterbox on his back.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although fears of a Continental invasion sound a familiar note of English
xenophobia, pundits were right to sense in the postcard signs of profound
cultural changes, for "at the height of the industry's boom, postcards
were virtually everywhere in the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Among contemporary commentators, James Douglas, writing in 1907,
 captured the peculiar modernity of postcards best when he imagined
 thirtieth-century archeologists fastening on "the Picture Postcard as
 the best guide to the spirit of the Edwardian era": "Every pimple on
 the earth's skin has been photographed, and wherever the

<B></B>

human eye roves or roams it detects the self-conscious air of the
reproduced" (quoted in <I>PPO</I>, 79). The "self-conscious air of
the reproduced": the phrase nicely evokes a range of experiences of
modernity, from Walter Benjamin's ambivalent eulogy for the auratic
in an age of mechanical reproduction to the growing desire for the
exotic in late imperial romance. Viewed from the twenty-first century,
then, the picture postcard begins to look like an emerging modernist
form--displacing the formal conventions of epistolary style with now
familiar vacation shorthand; eschewing the totalizing expansiveness of
Victorian narrative in favor of fragmentary utterances and the primacy
of the image; subordinating authorship to mechanical reproduction;
and seeking authenticity beyond the artifice of civilization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, the modern problem of authenticity helps account for the pervasive
circulation of picture postcards. The thrill of the postcard, Susan
Stewart has argued, derives from a hunger for a sense of authenticity
attached to location.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 An unprecedentedly public form of communication, postcards paradoxically
 function as a guarantor of the authentically personal. "Here I was,"
 the postcard declares to the recipient, thus bringing into being the
 "I" as both familiar sender and exotic locale, the two temporarily
 equated through the metaphor of location. The picture postcard thus
 participates in a process of subject formation marked by empire. For
 the uncanny subject produced by the postcard implies a dual relation
 to the pictured site that restages (in a less threatening register)
 the precarious dynamics of colonial exchange: the tourist assumes the
 subject position of the colonizer by appropriating the exotic site and
 returning it to the metropole; yet with its articulation propped on the
 authenticity of "being there," the familiar subject also appears to have
 "gone native" by merging with the space of the exotic, a transformation
 typically triggered within the recipient as well, who gazes at the
 image as if through the sender's eyes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf was undoubtedly attuned to the increasingly inescapable circulation
of picture postcards and its influence on the public imagination. Like
everyone else, she sent picture postcards, requested others to send them
to her, and complained about them as well, sometimes because she didn't
receive enough from friends abroad, sometimes because she did and would
have preferred a letter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Woolf mocked the older generation for their belief that postcards were
 killing the art of letter-writing, believing instead that the penny
 post was making letter-writing less studied and more sincere--which
 is to say more modern (<I>EOVW</I>, 2:182). In 1930 Woolf even wrote
 a caption for a National Portrait Gallery postcard of George Eliot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Yet she also saw picture postcards as emblems of transience and
 diminishment, writing of Ellen Terry that those who saw her only in a
 recent relatively undistinguished role would remember only "a picture
 postcard compared with the great Velasquez in the gallery" (<I>EOVW</I>,
 4:67). In <I>Jacob's Room</I> Fanny Elmer's stylized "idea of Jacob,"
 which for "two months" is "sustained entirely upon picture post cards,"
 indicates that her memory and imagination, like Rachel's when imagining
 England from abroad, are marked by Edwardian society's newest mass
 cultural form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 <I>The Waves</I>  registers the diminished cultural visibility of
 picture postcards--the craze subsided with the end of World War I--in
 Neville's thoughts about Percival: "He will forget me. He will leave
 my letters lying

<B></B>

about among guns and dogs unanswered. I shall send him poems and he will
perhaps reply with a picture post card."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Bittersweet tokens of neglect, postcards here seem to speak of their
 own evanescence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf was also well-versed in the Edwardian culture of exhibition. In
1909, when Woolf was laboriously reworking the manuscript that would
become <I>The Voyage Out</I>, the Imperial International Exhibition
in London brought several native settlements to Shepherd's Bush. Like
colonial postcards, imperial exhibitions collapsed the distance between
periphery and center by reproducing versions of colonized life on
English soil. But where the dynamics of postcard circulation subtly
mimed the process of imperial subject formation, imperial exhibitions
materially reproduced the operations of power by bringing actual bodies
back to England, where they became human exhibits within reconstructed
native villages. As many have shown, such exhibitions were designed
to consolidate belief in imperial superiority, most obviously in
the evolutionary vision that emphasized the enlightened progress from
benighted colonies into the aptly named White City, the main exhibition
center in England from 1907 to 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 From the 1890s to 1914 the rising number of simulated native villages
 created a species of "human showcase": "people from all over the
 world were brought into sites in order to be seen by others for their
 gratification and education. . . . [an] audience would pay to come
 and stare."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 With the whole world (in the form of the assembled peoples and objects)
 spread out before their controlling vision, spectators would watch
 one another watch the spectacle and thereby become part of the human
 showcase. But the English spectators became part of the display only
 in a privileged way: by seeing from an empowered position even as
 they were seen, spectators came to understand themselves as belonging
 to a particular kind of national community (<I>ROM</I>, 69). At one
 moment visitors might travel over the grounds by electric railway or
 enjoy a simulated trip to Paris through the long-planned "chunnel";
 the next they might wander into a Mongolian camp where twenty horsemen,
 "uncouth allies of a civilized power," engage in "a mimic battle" over
 "the body of a goat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Designed to persuade the metropolitan spectator that the "there" of
 colonial space had become the "here" of domestic English experience,
 such villages sharpened the contrast between England's technological
 modernity and the backwardness of outlying colonies by plunging the
 spectator into a form of "state-sponsored hallucination."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Here's what we are and will be, the Hall of Science might say;
 here's what we might have been once but are no longer, say the native
 villages. <B></B>To lock in a clearer sense of the place of the picture
 postcard within early twentieth-century modernization, then, we can say
 that postcard collections epitomize the effort of imperial exhibitions
 to assemble a complete image of the emerging global system even as
 individual cards herald the fragmentation of the totality that such
 exhibitions sought to represent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's essay on the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, "Thunder at Wembley,"
suggests that she had attended imperial exhibitions before, possibly
the 1909 London exhibition, and recognized their power to absorb the
spectator into an artificially transformed world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The official guide to the Imperial International Exhibition describes
 what Woolf would have experienced in the hallucinatory space of the
 Dahomey Village:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . we are at once transported to Western Africa, the land of the
Dahomeys and the Amazons. The beating of tom-toms, the panigan clanging,
and the grinding roar of the rattle greet us. Only a few years ago these
sounds meant the call to human sacrifices, but in this instance they
announce that these dark-skinned men and women and children are anxious
to entertain us by dance and song. Over 150 Dahomeys have taken up their
residence here, and reside in thatched huts just as they did before they
left the Dark Continent for the White City. [<I>DP</I>, 49-50]

Magically transported, the spectator is asked to see West Africa
as at once out of history and modernized: the thatched huts may be
unchanged, but barbaric violence is transformed into civilized spectacle,
blood-thirsty savages into anxious entertainers. The official guide's
strolling observer encourages an expansion of the exhibition's sphere of
influence: "Purchasing some picture-postcards from one of the many stalls
here, we plunge into the Post Office on our right, and despatch them to
unfortunate friends who have not seen the exhibition" (<I>DP</I>, 10).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Whether Woolf ever received such a postcard (see, for instance,
 <A HREF="8.1wollaeger_2.html"> 2</A>) is impossible to say,
 but "Thunder at Wembley" reveals that she thought deeply about the
 propagandistic effects of such exhibitions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's relation to exhibition culture evolved over the years, and
her essay on the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley reads like
a halfway house between the later optimism of <I>The Waves</I> 
and <I>Between the Acts</I>  and the early pessimism of <I>The
Voyage Out</I>. Reading Woolf's career in reverse, one can see that her
belief in these late novels, that spectacles can catalyze change, is
steadily displaced by worry over the seductive power of state-sponsored
spectacles, and her confidence in the power of individuals to deflect
or transform ideological conditioning decays.

2. Woolf and the Culture of Exhibition
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bernard's fantasy of Percival in India in <I>The Waves</I> produces a
sharply satiric perspective: "'I see India,' said Bernard. '. . . I see
the gilt and crenellated buildings which have an air of fragility and
decay as if they were temporarily run up buildings in some Oriental
exhibition'" (<I>TW</I>, 135-36). Within this imagined scene of
exhibition, Percival, wearing his sun helmet, solves "the Oriental
problem" of "the uselessness of human exertion" in a trice by "applying
the standards of the West" (<I>TW</I>, 136). The "air of fragility
and decay" suggests that the power of such displays has passed--they
function now only as metaphors--and secures Woolf's ironic distance from
the imperial values implicit in "Oriental" exhibitions. A decade later
in <I>Between the Acts</I> Woolf turns to a pageant play to explore the
deploying of spectacles for progressive ends. Miss La Trobe's historical
pageant culminates in a late modernist assertion of fragmentation--not
only its inevitability but its potential power--when in its closing
moment the players hold up shattered mirrors to the audience. By pushing
spectators "between" versions of themselves--or "jerk[ing] the ball out
of the cup"--La Trobe produces a moment of radical defamiliarization
from which new possibilities or "unacted parts" can emerge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 "What a small part I've had to play! But you've made me feel I could have
 played . . . Cleopatra!" says Lucy Swithin, an elderly woman unlikely to
 be mistaken for the Queen of the Nile (<I>BA</I>, 153). Feeling neither
 here nor there, La Trobe's audience begins to re-examine their national
 past in light of a transformed present, and her play becomes Woolf's
 trope for the power of spectacle to loosen an audience's otherwise
 secure ideological moorings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's attitude towards ideological spectacles is less assured and
more equivocal in "Thunder at Wembley" . E. M. Forster predicted
that while millions spend their money on the pitch at Wembley, "a few
highbrows will make fun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Woolf doesn't entirely disappoint. Her only extended description of
 exhibition-going anticipates the satiric tone of <I>The Waves</I> by
 pitting the ideological hold of empire, located in a display of global
 commodities, against an apocalyptic vision of nature rising up in the
 form of a sudden summer thunderstorm. The storm ultimately breaks the
 imperial "spell" and purges the world of the exhibitionary blight, but
 Woolf suggests that "Nature" also asserts herself in the individuality of
 spectators able to resist the show's blandishments. The failure of the
 exhibition's ideological project leads to Woolf's dry observation that
 perhaps the Duke of Devonshire, who praised the goal of the exhibition
 in <I>The Times</I>, should have denied entrance to all natural forces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The essay closes with a mock prophecy: "The Empire is perishing; the
 bands are playing; the Exhibition is in ruins" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412, 413).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "dissolving" pagodas and general "decay" of Woolf's Wembley probably
are the originals for "the fragility and decay" of the "temporarily run
up buildings" in Bernard's vision of Percival. Yet Wembley's attractions
are not without effect. For if the "dignity" of Woolf's stubbornly
independent compatriots makes them "a product to be proud of," they are
also "a little languid perhaps, a little attenuated," even docile as they
"stand in queues to have their spectacles rectified gratis . . . gaze
respectfully into sacks

<B></B>

of grain; glance reverently at mowing machines" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3: 413,
411). The idea of having one's vision corrected while studying commodities
at an imperial exhibition implies that the "product to be proud of" may
actually be precisely what Woolf says it is not: one product circulating
among others, a mass-produced, mesmerized English collectivity "trailing
and flowing" between the "coffee-grinder" and the "cream separator"
(<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Woolf's description of previous exhibitions at
Earls Court and the White City raises comparable questions about her
own immunity. In the earlier exhibitions, "The area was too small;
the light was too brilliant. If a single real moth strayed in to dally
with the arc lamps, he was at once transformed into a dizzy reveler;
if a laburnum tree shook her tassels, spangles of limelight floated in
the violet and crimson air. Everything was intoxicated and transformed"
(<I>EOVW</I>, 3:411). Given Woolf's well-known trope of the moth as
the artistic spirit, this example of the exhibition's absolute mastery
of nature suggests the danger that state propaganda might be able to
intoxicate and transform even her own imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet "Thunder at Wembley" also implies that Woolf is protected from dizzy
revelers by her class position, for both ends of the class spectrum seem
insulated from the ideological hailing of the state, epitomized mockingly
by a man banging a "bladder" while imploring spectators "to come tickle
the monkeys" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). At one end of the spectrum is a lower
middle-class woman "in the row of red-brick villas outside the grounds"
who wrings "a dish-cloth in the backyard" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Situated
beyond the boundaries of the exhibition, this woman remains unswayed by
imperial propaganda. At the other end is an obvious surrogate for Woolf,
a thrush to which Woolf attributes the "cynical reflection, at once so
chill and so superior," that the spectators surely could not be seduced
into tickling monkeys or otherwise responding to the siren song of the
exhibition. The song of the thrush does for exhibition-goers what Woolf
wishes to do for her readers: it undermines the efficacy of the official
message by calling attention to the beauty of nature--"a whole chestnut
tree with its blossoms standing . . . ordinary grass scattered with
petals"--that was transmogrified by earlier exhibitions (<I>EOVW</I>,
3:412). Nevertheless, the suspicion underlying "Thunder at Wembley" is
that the vast middle class lying between the chill superiority of the
thrush and the unwitting washer of dishes may be inclined to settle into
the posture refused by the sky: in an otherwise inexplicable negation,
the sky, Woolf informs her readers, is <I>not</I> found "lying back limp
but acquiescent in a green deckchair," and therefore never becomes "part
of the exhibition" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Insofar as other spectators,
foils for the rebellious sky, presumably do become part of the scenery,
the vision of the empire in ruins belongs only to the thrush and Woolf.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's surrogate in <I>The Voyage Out</I> is more vulnerable to the
hailing of empire, for the critical distance enjoyed by Woolf and Forster
at Wembley is unavailable to Rachel. In the novel's opening chapter,
London's West End, with "its electric lamps . . . vast plate-glass windows
. . . carefully-finished houses, and tiny live res trotting on the
pavement," is described as "a finished work" produced by the "enormous
factory" of east London (<I>VO</I>, 8). This is more than a familiar
modernist lament over the increasing regimentation of modern life. The
plate-glass windows, equally suitable for

<B></B>

the display of goods or antiquities, metonymically invoke the convergence
of consumerism and exhibitionary culture, and the English urbanites,
far from resisting the propagandistic display of consumer goods,
themselves become commodities, "tiny live res" manufactured to
populate the streets of the West End showcase (<I>VO</I>, 8). As the
Ambroses pass through this scene on their way to the <I>Euphrosyne</I>,
they can expect "neither help nor attention," we are told, from "a world
exclusively occupied in feeding waggons" (<I>VO</I>, 8-9). Woolf
hints that Rachel is similarly helpless; she may even be part of her
father's inventory: when Rachel later sighs over the "poor goats" her
father is shipping to South America, Woolf is coyly alluding to her own
family nickname, "Goat."

As the ship sets out, England is reduced to a "shrinking island in which
people were imprisoned" (<I>VO</I>, 26). It is in this oppressively
commercial prison that Ridley Ambrose momentarily finds himself entangled
with a man selling picture postcards. And it is this crowded space that
Rachel reinvokes when her imaginative reconstruction of England begins
with postcards. South America, always an imaginary realm of the exotic
for Woolf, ought to be different.

 But as Rachel is educated abroad, London's human showcase rematerializes
 across the ocean and up the Amazon, transforming native women into
 ethnographic exhibits and Rachel into an object destined for enjoyment
 by a young Englishman.

3. Educating Rachel: Bildungsroman, Sex, and Empire
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rachel's education is supervised by Helen at the request of Rachel's
father, who wants a polished hostess around the house to further his
Tory ambitions. Early in the novel Woolf links Rachel's education to
colonial exploration by framing Helen's realization that she would like
to teach her niece "how to live" with allusions to Helen's embroidery
(<I>VO</I>, 76). As if weaving the expedition up the Amazon that will
shape Rachel's fate, Helen works at "a great design of a tropical river
running through a tropical forest, where . . . a troop of naked natives
whirled darts into the air" (<I>VO</I>, 27).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The alliterative repetition of "tropical . . . tropical . . . troop"
 suggests the status of Helen's embroidery as trope, and her "great
 design" grows more capacious as the novel unfolds: it includes,
 among other things, her hopes that Rachel will marry as well as
 her entrusting of Rachel's education to Hirst, Terence's arrogant
 friend. From this point on <I>The Voyage Out</I> combines conventions
 of the <I>Bildungsroman</I> with those of late imperial romance in
 order to narrate Rachel's painful struggle to disentangle herself from
 "the pattern" of everyday life. This pattern, alternately a source
 of consolation and frustration, falls into a rhythm of expansion and
 contraction as Rachel tries to grasp her world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Politics always inform Rachel's education--not just the cultural politics
implicit in any education but the imperial politics governing England's
vision of the world as well. Well before Hirst lends her his copy of
Gibbon's <I>Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire</I>, Rachel learns about
empire from the Dalloways, who initiate her informal education when
they board the <I>Euphrosyne</I> in Lisbon. Catalyzing Rachel's suddenly
intense desire

<B></B>

to know the world--"'Please tell me--everything.' That was what she
wanted to say"--the Dalloways offer formative lessons in culture, empire,
and sexuality (<I>VO</I>, 50). Clarissa, "a fascinating spectacle,"
strikes Rachel as a gallery exhibit: "she was astonishingly like an
eighteenth-century masterpiece--a Reynolds or a Romney" (<I>VO</I>,
40). Consonant with her initial impression, Clarissa's lessons, like
her first comment to Rachel, are primarily cultural: "'It's so like
Whistler!' she exclaimed, with a wave toward the shore" (<I>VO</I>,
34). Cultural capital represents enormous power to Rachel, and Clarissa
seems able to make "the enormous globe [spin] round this way and that
beneath her fingers" (<I>VO</I>, 40).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Richard, who offers nearly simultaneous lessons in empire and sexuality,
also strikes Rachel as a fascinating spectacle with virtually global
power. Like a display from the Palace of Industry viewed from a patently
erotic perspective, he comes from "the humming oily centre of the
machine where the polished rods are sliding, and the pistons thumping"
(<I>VO</I>, 40). His political beliefs, he tells Rachel, can be summed
up in "one word--Unity. . . . The dispersion of the best ideas over the
greatest area" (<I>VO</I>, 57). Clarissa is nearby during Richard's first
lesson about sexuality but apparently does not overhear him speaking
to Rachel about sexual desire: "Girls are kept very ignorant, aren't
they?" he notes, as Rachel grows increasingly agitated (<I>VO</I>,
61). Just as she confesses her ignorance, they are interrupted:
"Warships, Dick!" Clarissa calls out. Even if we do not hear "warships"
as "worships," the exclamation is suggestive enough. As Rachel watches
Richard raise his hat to "two sinister grey vessels," Clarissa squeezes
her hand and exclaims: "Aren't you glad to be English!" (<I>VO</I>,
62). Upset by Richard's probing, Rachel remains quiet, looking "queer"
and "flushed." Clarissa's enveloping enthusiasm, however, gathers into
Englishness a link between empire and sexuality that receives increasing
attention as the narrative unfolds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Clarissa absent, Richard becomes a more hands-on instructor in the
pleasures of being English. Having shared his dream of consolidating the
world under the aegis of the British empire, Dalloway later drops into
Rachel's cabin and impulsively kisses her. "You tempt me," he explains
(<I>VO</I>, 68). Though his kiss produces a passing pleasure, only then
does Rachel begin to realize, to her shock and horror, why women cannot
walk alone in public. From this moment until her death she is haunted
by a dream in which she walks down a "long tunnel" with "damp bricks
on either side" that opens into "a vault," where she is "trapped" with
"a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering"; the "wall
behind him oozed with damp" (<I>VO</I>, 69-70). The sexual revulsion
expressed here is the last stage of Rachel's response to Dalloway's kiss:
"physical pain" leads to a numbing "chill of mind and body" and then to a
"strange exultation," before Rachel finally becomes "merely uncomfortable,
as if she and Richard had seen something together which is hidden in
ordinary life" (<I>VO</I>, 69). Trapped at once by her own sexuality
inside a damp womb and by an internalized cityscape evocative of an
underpass or the Underground, Rachel's sudden sexual awareness seems to
put her on the street along with the women she had never before recognized
as prostitutes. What Rachel has discovered "hidden in ordinary life"
are desires she cannot trust, her own and those of the men around her.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dalloway's kiss also bears on Helen's efforts to teach Rachel about
the ways of everyday life, for it is the revelation of Rachel's
sexual innocence that persuades Helen to arrange for her to stay in
Helen's brother's seaside villa instead of continuing inland with her
father. Explaining that Dalloway's overture is "the most natural thing
in the world," a "small thing that gets on one's nerves," "like noticing
the noises people make when they eat, or men spitting," Helen affects
Rachel in contradictory yet equally profound ways (<I>VO</I>, 74). On one
hand, by trying to help Rachel work through her upsetting experience,
Helen draws her young charge into a normative vision of heterosexual
relations that Rachel finds stifling. When Helen confirms that "those
women" in Piccadilly are prostitutes, Rachel suddenly sees "her whole
life for the first time a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously
between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness"
(<I>VO</I>, 74). On the other hand, by demystifying the Dalloways'
allure, Helen helps Rachel experience an expansive "vision of her own
personality . . . as a real everlasting thing, different from anything
else, unmergeable" (<I>VO</I>, 77). It is characteristic of Woolf's
ambivalent presentation of Helen that Helen explicitly rejects the
connection between sex and politics that Rachel intuits. (Why else
would Rachel run to read about public res in <I>Who's Who</I> right
after coming to terms with Dalloway's kiss?) Discounting "this confusion
between politics and kissing politicians," Helen continues to stitch at
her embroidery, unaware that her great design helps propagate Dalloway's
vision of a unified world (<I>VO</I>, 76).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When the <I>Euphrosyne</I> arrives in Santa Marina, Richard's imperial
ideals are immediately reinvoked. English sailors in "Elizabethan
barques," we learn, had established a "great British colony" only to be
displaced by Spanish galleons: "All seemed to favour the expansion of
the British Empire, and had there been men like Richard Dalloway in the
time of Charles the First, the map would undoubtedly be red where it is
now an odious green" (<I>VO</I>, 81-82). In the years prior to their
arrival a second chance has developed in the form of "a small colony" of
English "in search of something new" who found in Santa Marina a place
"full of new forms of beauty," including "strangely beautiful" natives
and "primitive carvings coloured bright greens and blues" (<I>VO</I>,
82-83). The desire to find something new ushers the reader into the
attenuated exoticism of <I>The Voyage Out</I>'s invocation of imperial
romance.

4. Imperial Romance and the Weight of the World
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reinvented for nineteenth-century fiction by Sir Walter Scott, modern
romance literature represents modernity's uncanny vision of the worlds it
has superseded. By the late nineteenth century, romance had to work hard
to recover traces of what might have existed prior to the global reach of
capital. Hence Marlow's lament in <I>Heart of Darkness</I> that all the
blank spots of the map had already been colored in by colonial powers,
a trope echoed as the <I>Euphrosyne</I> arrives in Santa Marina in the
"odious green" of Spain's holdings in South America (<I>VO</I>, 82).
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Woolf organizes Rachel's South American experience around three
 excursions, each of which draws on romance conventions: the journey
 from England; the picnic ascent of Mt. Rosa; and the trip up the Amazon.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ascent of Monte Rosa locates the story of Rachel's growing intimacy
with Terence within a vision of global domestication and elaborates
the link between sexuality and politics already implicit in Rachel's
ambivalent response to Dalloway. As Evelyn and Alfred Perrott, two
relatively minor characters, overlook the South American plains from
the summit, Evelyn announces that if she were a man, she would "raise a
troop and conquer some great territory": "I'd love to start life from the
very beginning as it ought to be" (<I>VO</I>, 127). Poor Perrott, clearly
overmatched, can muster only a weakly literal-minded rebuttal: "conquer
a territory? They're all conquered already, aren't they?" (<I>VO</I>,
127). Perhaps a young Edwardian gentleman could be forgiven for supposing
that all lands had been claimed, most of them by England, but Evelyn sighs
in response: "It's the idea, don't you see? We lead such tame lives"
(<I>VO</I>, 127). Through the re of Evelyn, a parodic archetype of
woman as colonizer, the novel repeatedly links the domestication of women
to the domestication of the globe: at one moment Evelyn is turning down
yet another marriage proposal, in the next she fantasizes about becoming
a second Napoleon.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rest of the chapter sustains the tension between Evelyn's bracing
vision of unexplored worlds and the prospect of a wholly domesticated
globe by counterpointing Rachel's impulse to withdraw from society
with the sense that rituals of social engagement are inescapable. Two
moments mark opposite ends of the spectrum: the sudden connection
between Helen and Mrs. Thornbury forged by the discovery of a single
common acquaintance--"Mrs. Parry's drawing-room, though thousands of
miles away, behind a vast curve of water on a tiny piece of earth,
came before their eyes"--and the closing words of the previous chapter,
in which Terence asks Rachel what she is looking at as she reclines
away from the others: "She was a little startled but answered directly,
'Human beings.'" (<I>VO</I>, 136). Since Rachel tends to position herself
like an ethnographer outside her own culture, it is fitting that she
first sees Terence while peering in through a hotel window. The plot,
however, soon pulls Rachel into hotel society, where she plays the piano
at an engagement dance. If Evelyn wants to remake civilization "from the
very beginning" on her own terms, Rachel evidently has good reason to
feel increasingly trapped within a culture always ready to materialize,
like Mrs. Parry's drawing-room, wherever two Englishmen meet, even across
"a vast curve of water."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rachel's personal encounters in the chapters leading up to the river
expedition heap up more reasons for wishing to step outside her
culture. Unfolding like a series of experiments, these relationships
elaborate the pattern of confinement and expansion that begins with
Rachel's ambivalent response to Richard and Helen and continues into
her relationship with Terence. With Terence Rachel feels alternately
at ease and trapped. When she tells him about her shuttered life in
Richmond with her aunts she finds her way to a "childlike state of
interest and pleasure"--until Terence explains that her everyday life
interests him because as a fledgling novelist he craves information about
women. Suddenly "under observation," Rachel experiences his "determination
to know" as a form of bullying, and indeed, his perception of her body
during their conversation foreshadows the increasingly domineering role
he will play after

<B></B>

their engagement (<I>VO</I>, 201). Although Terence sees "a young woman's
body not yet developed . . . and thus interesting and even lovable,"
Woolf betrays Terence's <I>need</I> to see Rachel as undeveloped and
dependent by reminding us a few sentences later that she is twenty-four
years old (<I>VO</I>, 196).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The social pressure on Rachel's body intensifies when she finds herself
caught up in a series of obscurely instructive and ambiguously erotic
encounters with other women in the hotel. Evelyn captures Rachel
first, and her aggressive challenge to Rachel to seize the day--"We
don't <I>do</I> things. What do you <I>do</I>?"--takes on an erotic
cast when she places her hand on Rachel's knee, which Rachel finds
"exciting" and "also disagreeable" (<I>VO</I>, 236, 237). Escaping
Evelyn's clutches, Rachel finds herself looking down from a balcony on
a kitchen courtyard where an old woman runs down a chicken and cuts off
its head "with an expression of vindictive energy and triumph combined"
(<I>VO</I>, 240). Rachel recoils from the violence and is immediately
gathered up by the spinster Miss Allan, who shepherds Rachel into her
room on the chance that she might want to "add a new pleasure to life"
(<I>VO</I>, 241). "I make it a rule to try everything," Miss Allan remarks
as Rachel spits out some preserved ginger the older woman had urged on
her (<I>VO</I>, 241). Rachel is then introduced to Miss Allan's regular
traveling companion, a bottle of cr&ecirc;me de menthe two years older
than Rachel named Oliver, which a female friend bestows on her whenever
she travels abroad. In a kind of dream logic, the decapitation of the
chicken colors the subtly unsettling scenes with Miss Allan and Evelyn
on either side, as if to say that any role available to women requires
a sacrifice, a sacrifice Rachel will later embody while dying of fever.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tension between a muted eroticism urging untried experiences
and the insistent banality of existence intensifies Rachel's sense
of being trapped in an increasingly familiar pattern. Leaving Miss
Allan's room, Rachel soon finds herself in "a complete block in the
passage" when they run into Mrs. Paley (<I>VO</I>, 245). The hallway
being lined with shoes set out for cleaning, Miss Allan tries to make
conversation with the nearly deaf older woman by repeating three times:
"I was just saying that people are so like their boots" (<I>VO</I>,
244). She is about to repeat this home truth for a fourth time when
Rachel bolts away to a <I>cul de sac</I> at the end of the hall, where
she is gripped by a vision of the world "in its true proportions":
"She disliked the look of it immensely--churches, politicians, misfits,
and huge impostures. . . . For the time, her own body was the source of
all the life in the world, which tried to burst forth here--there--and
was repressed now by Mr. Bax, now by Evelyn, now by the imposition
of ponderous stupidity, the weight of the entire world" (<I>VO</I>,
245). Mr. Bax has earned Rachel's anger with a sermon on the duty the
English owe the colonized that translates Dalloway's imperial vision
into a Christian imperative: properly practiced, Christian sympathy,
like a drop of water falling into the ocean, "alters the conration of
the globe" (<I>VO</I>, 220). Once again, Woolf links Rachel's everyday
life to a sense of global interrelatedness, weaving Christianity along
with English imperialism, marriage, and patriarchy into the great design
shaping Rachel's confused maturation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "weight of the world," "the conration of the globe": against
pressure of this magnitude Rachel's desire for release grows. It is thus
not surprising that Mr. Flushing's

<B></B>

exotic picture of what might await them up the Amazon captures Rachel's
imagination: ". . . wonderful treasures lay hid in the depths of
the land. . . . there might be giant gods hewn out of stone in the
mountain-side; and colossal res standing by themselves in the middle
of green pasture lands, where none but natives had ever trod. . . .
Nobody had been there; scarcely anything was known" (<I>VO</I>,
225). Far from entering the "lost world" of Conan Doyle's South America,
however, the expedition party will travel into a world to which, as in
the vision of India in <I>The Waves</I>, "the standards of the West"
have already been applied. The native women they meet upriver resemble
the postcard images of native woman that flowed into England from South
America and Africa, and the circulation of such postcards, I will show
in the following sections, both reinforced and undermined the imperial
stereotypes that Rachel must negotiate as she follows English culture
out into the world and attempts to establish her identity.

<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In their insistent framing and arranging of the female body, colonial
 postcards propagate a normative vision Richard Dalloway would find
 congenial. Rachel's struggle with normalization continues in her journey
 upriver, which culminates in three tightly-linked scenes: her engagement,
 a scene of partially erased sexual dissidence, and her encounter with
 the native women.

Postcards featuring native women often operate as a form of colonial
denigration that reinforces normative values at home.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 In an early century card from Peru, three bare-breasted women, all of
 whom are short, heavy, and sullen by prevailing European standards,
 earn the title "<I>las tres gracias de las Indias Piros</I>" (<A
 HREF="8.1wollaeger_3.html"> 3</A>). Circulating with huge
 numbers of cards displaying English actresses, music hall performers,
 and famous courtesans, this card hardly bothers to disguise the snicker
 behind the cross-cultural gesture of its caption. The imposition of
 a Western frame is often more stark, as in a card bearing the caption
 "A Zulu Masher" (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_4.html"> 4</A>). Dated
 by hand February 14, 1905, the card shows a smiling young Zulu woman
 whose native beads and belt are supplemented with top hat, monocle,
 jauntily held cigarette, and stylish walking stick. Given the common
 Western assumption that Africans, particularly women, were oversexed,
 a male recipient might construe the card as a mocking performance of
 his masculinity in blackface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Yet if cross-dressing often disrupts cultural norms, the cross-racial
 and cross-gender masquerade in this exchange seems more likely to have
 reinforced traditional roles. Addressed on Valentine's Day to a "Miss
 F. Southwell" by "Georgie Southwell" (a playful joke at a sister's
 expense?), the card implies that a woman's failure to rein in desires
 may subject her to ridicule.

Less satiric cards sometimes inscribe non-white women into
English culture as objects of genuine aesthetic and erotic
appreciation. In an early-century card collected in Kenya (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_5.html"> 5</A>), a woman from the Boran tribe
is posed to display her visual appeal; similar cards sometimes use the
caption "A Native Beauty." In other cards a more

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 59]</B>

stylized composition produces a kind of formal portraiture
that further aestheticizes the women, abstracting them
from the scene of colonial encounter. In a card from Natal (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_6.html"> 6</A>), for instance, the symmetrical
arrangement of trees and women doubly framing a Zulu woman made to stage
her toilet for the camera partially transforms the indigenous environment
into the artificial space of a studio. The effacing of the indigenous
setting is complete in other cards, such as Eduardo Polack's shot of a
"Bella India" in Peru (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_7.html"> 7</A>),
which whites out any trace of the model's own environment. Insofar as
these women become interchangeable with images of English actresses and
courtesans circulating in England, the photographic abstraction blurring
the differences between the English and "the native" begins to resemble a
form of symbolic acculturation: in Elizabethan times women were imported
into Santa Marina's first settlement; these cards complete the exchange
by shaping women into objects suitable for export (<I>VO</I>, 82).

The sexual and racial meanings disseminated by such cards depends in part
on the interplay between production and circulation. In an early-century
example from Natal (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_8.html"> 8</A>),
three signs plot the card's itinerary: the postmark (July 24, 1904),
the address to a Miss Ashby in Yorkshire, and the message inscribed on
the front: "I am feeling

<B></B>

<B></B>

better again. Will write next week." With the angles of her right
arm balanced by the angles formed by her left arm and the banjo, the
"native musician" is virtually abstracted. The subordination of the body
to an angular design is both heightened and complicated by the musical
instrument, for the banjo does not simply complete the triangular motif
established by the women's right arm: in origin an African instrument,
the banjo would have been recognized by European and American audiences
as a signifier of race owing to its incorporation into minstrel shows.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 In fact, this complex articulation of a racialized body within
 a Western design, in circulation just over a year before Picasso
 began to "Africanize" <I>les Desmoiselles d'Avigon</I>, constitutes a
 popular anticipation of the vogue for primitivism that would transform
 European high art over the next decade. Race is thus inseparable from
 the abstraction, as is the prurient interest in the woman's nudity,
 the pose evidently being dictated as much by the desire to

<B></B>

have her breast lifted toward the camera as by the formal requirements
of symmetry. The suggestiveness that would have been activated by
any sexual innuendo in a message sent to a man is mitigated here by
the banality of the inscription and the fact that the addressee is an
unmarried woman. Instead, consonant with the emergence of museum culture,
the image takes on a certain clinical quality, an effect amplified
in the ethnographic perspective solicited by the printed caption, "A
Native musician." The card's trajectory from Natal to Yorkshire thus
partially erases the erotic investment in the exotic other that shaped
the production of the card in the first place. While in many staged
photographs a glimpse of the reality of the models' lives shows through,
in this instance the rescripting through exchange (the inscription and
mailing of the card) of a body already scripted within the colonial
scene of production (the photographer's arranging of the model) results
in an overdetermined cultural coding that obliterates any sense of the
historical body prior to its entry into the studio. A token of exchange,
the model is transformed into an image of racialized sexuality sanitized
for export to England.

Without this coding, the strict norms regulating English sexual expression
at home (although under siege from many quarters) never would have
permitted the open circulation of bare-breasted women in postcards.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 (A related domestic postcard strategy covered naked women with white
 powder and posed them as classical statuary.) These norms find distinct
 expression in <I>The Voyage Out</I> in the banishing of a prostitute
 seen late at night in the hotel corridors and in the instant decoding
 of the significance of Susan Warrington and Arthur Venning's first
 embrace: "Well, we may take it for granted that they're engaged,"
 Terence remarks (<I>VO</I>, 130). The frank sexuality attributed
 to non-white women under the cover of the ethnographic alibi
 in postcards provided a form of licensed titillation while also
 throwing into relief the relative virtue of respectable Englishwomen,
 whose sexuality remained bound by marriage. Filtering native life
 through English concerns, other cards reinforced these norms by
 highlighting images of socially-sanctioned sexuality. Card after
 card evinces a need to identify images of far-flung domesticity. A
 representative Cape Town card postmarked July 1908 shows a reclining
 woman breast-feeding a child over the caption "A Native Woman and Child"
 (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_9.html"> 9</A>); an early-century card
 from Lagos (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_0.html"> 10</A>) showing
 a woman holding a small child is labeled "Motherhood." A British
 East African card showing three adults and seven children grouped
 casually on the ground before a hut is labeled "A Kikuyu Family"
 (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_1.html"> 11</A>), but who is to say
 what brought them together in the frame? Like the nostalgic images of
 Edwardian idylls in domestic cards and pastoral novels, the fascination
 with native mothers and families is symptomatic of a cultural need
 to ease anxieties in a time when falling birthrates were thought to
 presage the decline of England's imperial power.

Against this backdrop, the potential dissidence of Rachel's desire in
the scene of her engagement and its immediate aftermath becomes all
the more striking. When the excursion party pauses for lunch not long
before arriving at the native village, Rachel and Terence wander together
through an oddly charged landscape in which they kiss for the first time
and thus discover themselves engaged. The nearly surreal

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 64]</B>

quality of the scene clearly derives in part from a resurfacing of the
sexual anxiety Rachel felt in response to Dalloway's kiss. Woolf's
biography offers ample evidence of her own ambivalence toward
heterosexuality, from the sexuality frigidity of her relations with
Leonard to her affairs with other women, and it is easy to discover
similar feelings in the images of churning water that accompany Rachel's
response to her first embrace of Terence: "Terrible--terrible," she
murmurs (<I>VO</I>, 258).
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The churning of Rachel's desire, moreover, recalls the "river torrent"
 in Helen's embroidery, thus underscoring the erotic character of their
 penetration into the jungle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the scene also feels peculiarly dislocated because their engagement
takes place in a jungle landscape that seems at once cleansed of
all meanings and suffused with cultural significance. On one hand,
the alien quality of a world unarticulated by conventional categories
renders the lovers "unable to frame any thoughts" and their voices join
"in tones of strange unfamiliar sound which formed no words" (<I>VO</I>,
258). Seemingly numbed by a world resistant to consciousness, they talk
like aliens encountering the idea of love and marriage for the first
time, and their affectless repetition of conventionally appropriate words
("We love each other") sound like incantations designed to explain their
experience to themselves. On the other hand, their walk through the jungle
is laden with established meanings: Hirst cautions them against snakes,
for instance, and Terence chooses to break the silence by flinging a "red
fruit" into the air and watching it fall to the ground (<I>VO</I>, 257).
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 The implied fall narrative also resonates with crucial moments in
 Rachel's life, thus re-narrativizing a moment of unanchored being
 that would otherwise drift away from plot. To cite just one example
 among many, a path "hedged in by dense creepers" that "burst here
 and there into star-shaped crimson flowers" recalls Rachel's anxious
 vision of her life as "a creeping hedged-in thing" as well as her angry
 response to the disciplining of her body, which "tried to burst forth
 here--there--and was repressed"; the knottedness of the creepers also
 resonates with Rachel's sense that Austen's marriage plots--urged on
 her by Clarissa--are too like a "tight plait" (<I>VO</I>, 257, 245,
 51). The deep tension within the scene thus derives not simply from an
 unresolved wavering between heterosexual and lesbian desire, as many
 critics have argued, but from an encompassing anxiety about <I>any</I>
 fixing of desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only a glimpse of potentially dissident desire survives in the surreal
dislocation of a scene sandwiched between Rachel's engagement and
her entry into the native village. Without warning or explanation "a
hand . . . abrupt as iron" knocks Rachel to the ground; her fragmentary
impressions gradually reveal that Helen is "upon her" rolling her about in
tall grasses that whip across Rachel's eyes and fill her mouth and ears.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The ur-scene in <I>Melymbrosia</I>, a reconstructed earlier version of
 the novel, is much clearer and more explicit: Helen chases after Rachel
 through tall grasses until Rachel suddenly stops to open her arms;
 Helen then rolls her down into the tall grass and proclaims her love.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 <I>Melymbrosia</I>'s intensely realized moment of desire--simultaneously
 lesbian, sororal, and maternal--survives in <I>The Voyage Out</I>
 only in an elliptically ambiguous form: looking up to see Terence and
 Helen standing over her kissing, Rachel raises herself up, and "she too
 realized Helen's soft body" (<I>VO</I>, 269). Although Rachel's embrace
 of Helen moves her in a way Terence's kiss does not, Helen's perspective

<B></B>

(and thus her declaration of love) disappears altogether, leaving only
Rachel's subjectively-rendered experience of confusion, which distorts
potentially errant desires almost beyond recognition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As if confirming her domestication, in the next two paragraphs Rachel
begins to follow Terence's lead, "stopping where he stopped, turning
where he turned, ignorant of the way, ignorant why he stopped or why he
turned" (<I>VO</I>, 250). The process of normalization is completed when
they follow Mr. Flushing into the native village, "falling into line"
in his wake (<I>VO</I>, 259, 269). The domestic tableau they encounter
suggests that all roads now lead to home, "the goal of their journey"
(<I>VO</I>, 270).

 Following immediately after Rachel's tumble in the grass with Helen

<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 But an instability of the ethnographic frame alters the usual exhibition
 dynamics in a way that comments implicitly on the partial erasure of
 dissident desire in the preceding scenes. Rachel, Terence, Hirst, Helen,
 and the Flushings walk together into the village:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Stepping cautiously, they observed the women, who were squatting on
the ground in triangular shapes, moving their hands, either plaiting
straw or in kneading something in bowls. But when they had looked for
a moment undiscovered, they were seen, and Mr. Flushing, advancing into
the centre of the clearing, was engaged in talk with a lean majestic man,
whose bones and hollows at once made the shapes of the Englishman's body
appear ugly and unnatural. The women took no notice of the strangers,
except that their hands paused for a moment and their long narrow eyes
slid round and fixed upon them with the motionless inexpressive gaze of
those removed from each other far far beyond the plunge of speech. Their
hands moved again, but the stare continued. It followed them as they
walked, as they peered into huts where they could distinguish guns leaning
in the corner. . . . in the dusk the solemn eyes of babies regarded them,
and old women stared out too. As they sauntered about, the stare followed
them, passing over their legs, their bodies, their heads, curiously,
not without hostility, like the crawl of a winter fly. As she drew apart
her shawl and uncovered her breast to the lips of her baby, the eyes of
a woman never left their faces, although they moved uneasily under her
stare, and finally turned away, rather than stand there looking at her any
longer. When sweetmeats were offered them, they put out great red hands
to take them, and felt themselves treading cumbrously like tight-coated
soldiers among these soft instinctive people. [<I>VO</I>, 270]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bennett argues that as exhibition spectators watch one another watch the
spectacle, they become a self-regulating crowd that consolidates its
national identity through their mutual regard (<I>ROM</I>, 69). Here,
confusing pronoun references that Woolf introduced in revision suggest
not a sense of shared English superiority to the "soft instinctive people"
on display, but a breakdown of boundaries between English subject and

<B></B>

native object. By the end of the description of reciprocal staring, the
"they" of "although they moved uneasily under her stare" momentarily
seems to refer back to "the eyes" of the native woman rather than to
the strolling tourists. In the next sentence, the "great red hands"
seem to belong to natives who reach out to accept English confections,
but the next clause reverses the relation by identifying those receiving
the sweetmeats as the tourists, "treading cumbrously like tight-coated
soldiers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Mr. Flushing literalizes the breakdown of the frame by entering the
 clearing, where the contrast between his body and the conventional
 majesty of the noble savage makes the Englishman part of the
 spectacle. Soon afterwards Flushing and his wife acknowledge another
 blurring of boundaries when they question whether the artifacts they
 bought from the natives do not show "signs here and there of European
 influence" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Eventually the rest of the party joins
 Flushing within the frame and is "absorbed" into the life of the village
 (<I>VO</I>, 270). For all but the Flushings, who remain impervious
 to introspection, their absorption into the village coupled with the
 intensity of the returned gaze proves deeply unsettling. Terence and
 Rachel begin to feel "very cold and melancholy"; Hirst feels embittered,
 unhappy, and alone; Helen worries like an anxious mother over "the
 delicate flesh of men and women" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Far from reinforcing
 a sense of racial and cultural superiority, Woolf's exhibition unnerves
 her central characters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Rachel's positioning within the scene of exhibition complicates
Woolf's apparent critique of the imperial hierarchy that normally would
preserve European privilege. On one hand, insofar as the narrative
equates Rachel and the native women, patriarchal and colonial oppression
coincide to produce a critique of colonialism. On the other hand, by
transforming the native women into a mere backdrop for Rachel's inner
drama, Woolf partially reproduces the imperial hierarchy the novel
otherwise attacks. These claims require more detailed attention.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf clearly indicates that the gender politics informing Rachel's life
also govern the native village. Like the description of Rachel and Terence
moving into the uncanny space of their engagement, the expedition party's
movement into the native village weaves together phrases linked to the
marriage plot that has increasingly circumscribed Rachel's life. The
women's "plaiting of straw," for instance, echoes the knotted creepers
binding the trees at the site of Rachel's engagement as well as Austen's
"tight plait." The image recurs after they return from the expedition
and sit listening in the afternoon heat to Terence reading aloud Milton's
marriage masque, <I>Comus</I>: the water nymph "sitting / Under the glassy
cool translucent wave, / in <I>twisted braids</I> of lilies knitting /
the loose train" of her hair gives Rachel the headache that portends her
protracted death over the last three chapters of the novel (<I>VO</I>,
310). As water laps at the foot of Rachel's bed during her first day
of fever, these lines haunt her, suggesting both the symbolic threat
of Milton (author of the first domestic epic) and the more palpable
threat of domestic life with Terence. Before the engagement Evelyn says
approvingly that there's "something of a woman" in Terence (<I>VO</I>,
235), but afterwards he tries to silence Rachel's music by suggesting
that her playing of a Beethoven sonata is unnatural.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Similar gender politics obtain in the native village. In
 <I>Melymbrosia</I> the

<B></B>

native women carry goods back and forth to Mr. Flushing; but when
Mr. Flushing moves into the clearing to conduct business in <I>The
Voyage Out</I>, the native women remain literally and ratively at
the periphery. The implied structural parallel between Rachel and the
native women suggests an equality in subjection.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the scene of exhibition also positions Rachel and her fellow travelers
as involuntary agents of the dominant powers to which Rachel typically
feels subjected. Clearly accustomed to the European stare, the women
are just one more stop on a well-trodden path. When Hirst sees deer
bounding away from the riverbank as they approach the native village,
he laments having left his Kodak behind, even though his camera would
simply literalize the framing power the tourists already possess. Even
Rachel's identification with the women implies a reassertion of her
hierarchical advantage. Intuiting her affinities with them, Rachel has a
vision of eternal stasis: "So it would go on for ever and ever, she said,
those women sitting under the trees, the trees and the river" (<I>VO</I>,
271). As Rachel begins to see herself as a woman destined to have a child
at her breast and a sewing kit on her lap, her married future is mapped
onto the colonized, who become a kind of colonial-domestic hallucination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As both resistant bodies and hallucinations, the native women occupy a
curiously contradictory place in the logic of the narrative. The flicker
of independent subjectivity in the unsettling force of their stare
renders them semi-autonomous beings, subject to but not wholly dominated
by the tourists who gaze at the human showcase. But as emblems of female
abjection and the normalization of desire, they merge into the cycles of
nature. Rachel thus becomes not only the colonized woman subject to the
framing power of English patriarchy but also the colonizing woman with
a monopoly on the power of articulation: while Rachel formulates them
with a phrase, the "motionless inexpressive" women remain "removed from
each other far far beyond the plunge of speech" (<I>VO</I>, 270). At
once the photographer and the photographed, Rachel is implicated, even
as she turns away, in a form of power she cannot escape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such unresolved tensions in <I>The Voyage Out</I> help to make visible
comparable moments in colonial postcards. Woolf's interest in the
interplay between the represented and the representer and between the
representation and the spectator emerges distinctly in an earlier
description of a photograph of Rachel's dead mother: "The need of
sitting absolutely still before a Cockney photographer had given her
lips a queer little pucker, and her eyes for the same reason looked
as though she thought the whole situation ridiculous" (<I>VO</I>,
78). The women in colonial postcards can also seem to transgress
the boundaries of the frame, particularly when the returned stare,
"not without hostility," expresses a distinct sense of the model's
dismay over her enforced pose (<I>VO</I>, 270). Consider again some
of the postcards discussed earlier. In "The Toilet: Zulu Girls" (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_6.html">6</A> the apprehensive yet sullen stare
of the woman made to stage her toilet for the camera radiates resentment
toward the viewer peering in over the photographer's shoulder. Faced
with such a look, one can understand the discomfort of Helen, who blames
the Flushings "for having come on this expedition, for having ventured
too far and exposed themselves" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Although Helen never
explains the precise nature of this exposure, she evidently feels they
have all become vulnerable simply by

<B></B>

opening themselves to the stare of the women. In <I>Melymbrosia</I>,
in contrast, the "eyes seemed to follow them <I>without</I> hostility"
(<I>M</I>, 211; emphasis added). Viewed in this light, the Boran beauty
photographed in Kenya (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_5.html">5</A>
can be seen to challenge the postcard's aesthetic-ethnographic alibi:
her braceleted wrists pressed together and her sad countenance begin
to suggest a handcuffed captive trapped by the power relations that
placed her before the camera. More militant, the "Bella India" of Peru
(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_7.html">7</A> defies the scopic regime
of colonialism with an accusatory stare that demands reciprocal exposure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the benefit of hindsight, one can read in the penetrating gaze
returned in such cards signs of the resistance that would ultimately
culminate in rebellious new nationalisms. This anticipatory reading
accords with Woolf's fantasy of the end of empire at Wembley as she
watches the rain whip through the exhibition grounds. In both cases,
carefully arranged scenes of imperial superiority become self-subverting
when elements refuse to remain neatly in the frame: the sky will not
lie back "limp" and "acquiescent" at the fair grounds; the glimpse
of independent subjectivity in the eyes of native women disrupts
colonialism's aestheticizing of its own power. Insofar as the unstable
relation between autonomous beings and hallucinatory projections places
Woolf's novel and the postcards in a mutually illuminating relationship,
this instability is critically productive: the postcards highlight the
pressure of normalization within Woolf's representation of the native
women even as their challenging stare breaks through the Orientalism of
the postcards, now seen to anticipate a postcolonial desire to shatter
the frame.

7. Race and the Emancipation of Women
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To return to the question with which I began: can an Englishwoman
colonized under patriarchy avoid becoming a colonizer in her turn? The
answer returned by <I>The Voyage Out</I>, unlike any other in Woolf,
turns on the way Rachel's complex positioning within the novel's
climactic scene of exhibition illuminates a critical hesitation in Woolf's
understanding of race. It would be easy to criticize Woolf for a form of
"white solipsism" that "passively colludes with a racist culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Certainly one would be hard pressed to find in her fiction any of
 the cross-racial masquerades that recent criticism has linked to the
 emergence of Anglo-American modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Indeed, if the dubious image of Woolf in blackface during the Dreadnought
 hoax is any gauge, racial masquerade for her was simply a masquerade,
 a prank rather than a strategic racial repositioning in relation to
 dominant society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 But the singularity of Woolf's treatment of race in <I>The
 Voyage Out</I>--the way in which it strains <I>against</I> racial
 self-enclosure--emerges distinctly against the background of her later
 writing. Consider a 1925 diary entry in which Woolf describes giving
 a biscuit to a little girl who reminds her of herself; moments later
 she looks down from a bus at "a nigger gentleman, perfectly fitted
 out in swallow tail &amp; bowler &amp; gold headed cane." Clearly he
 is as improbable for Woolf as the Zulu Masher must have been for its
 intended audience (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_4.html">4</A>. "What
 were his thoughts?" Woolf wonders. Her speculative response charts a
 racial gulf. Was

<B></B>

he thinking, she muses, "of the degradation stamped on him, every time
he raised his hand &amp; saw it black as a monkeys outside, tinged with
flesh colour within?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Woolf's ability to imagine other minds in this entry clearly turns more
 on race than on gender, and the stark dichotomy between racial opacity
 and transparency throws into relief the relative complexity of <I>The
 Voyage Out</I>, which remains suspended between imperial objectification
 and intimations of an equivalent center of self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The singularity of <I>The Voyage Out</I> can be further clarified
in relation to a little-discussed moment in <I>A Room of One's
Own</I>. Following her famous discussion of Shakespeare's martyred sister,
Woolf turns to women's historical need to remain chaste, where chastity
refers to the preservation of anonymity as a defense against a public
life dominated by men. The idea of chastity already looks back to <I>The
Voyage Out</I>, in which Rachel's death can be construed as an attempt
to remain chaste, a point underlined by Woolf's use of <I>Comus</I>. But
a racially-grounded connection between <I>The Voyage Out</I> and <I>A
Room of One's Own</I> becomes more striking when Woolf explains how
women differ from men: men have a need for publicity and ownership--of a
passing woman, a dog, "a piece of land or a man with curly black hair. It
is one of the great advantages of being a woman that one can pass even
a very fine negress without wishing to make an Englishwoman of her."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However ironic the tone or humorous the intent (and the word "even"
implies a familiar Bloomsbury archness), this last sentence clearly
replays the key scene in Woolf's native village. In both cases, a mobile
white woman passes by a motionless black woman who becomes a passive
object of the white woman's purportedly benign gaze, and race provides
a way to think gender. In <I>A Room of One's Own</I> the silent black
body serves simultaneously to define the relative emancipation of white
women while absolving them of the guilt of colonialism: <I>men</I> want
to own the "negress" by assimilating her, women don't. Woolf returns to
this blunt disavowal in <I>Three Guinea</I>'s vision of an Outsider's
Society of women who would shun "all such ceremonies as encourage the
desire to impose 'our' civilization or 'our' dominion upon other people"
(<I>TG</I>, 109). In <I>The Voyage Out</I> Rachel, like Woolf, discovers
her identity as a woman by measuring herself against a racial other. One
expects in imperial romance to find metropolitan subjects discovering
images of their own desire at the boundaries of civilization. But
in <I>The Voyage Out</I> Rachel finds an image of what <I>others</I>
desire <I>for her</I>. Passing by, she discovers not her freedom but
her constraint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Killing Rachel off, Woolf responds to Rachel's resistance to becoming both
subject and object of imperialism by removing her from a dichotomy that is
fundamental to all forms of hierarchy. Woolf's later efforts to collapse
subject-object relations, most explicitly in <I>To the Lighthouse</I>,
remain on the plane of philosophy and aesthetic expression, perhaps
because her first effort to work through the distinction in the context
of race, patriarchy, and empire ends in a dispiriting reassertion of
oppressive norms. Ironically, it is Helen, Rachel's would-be mentor,
who sees most clearly into the cultural claustrophobia she unwittingly
heightens: "It seemed to [Helen] that a moment's respite was allowed
. . . and then again the profound and reasonless law asserted itself,
moulding them all to its liking" (<I>VO</I>, 250; ellipsis added). In
<I>The Voyage Out</I> Woolf

<B></B>

proposes multiple candidates for the reasonless law: imperialism,
patriarchy, capitalism, heteronormativity, and their tendency to reinforce
one another. When Hirst settles back comfortably to watch "the pattern
build itself up" after Rachel's death, "pattern" evokes an almost
paranoid vision of cultural and political interconnection (<I>VO</I>,
354). Linking the Thames to the waters of the Amazon, the circulation of
picture postcards operates as a metonymy for this dystopian consolidation,
one in which the world is constituted, as Richard Dalloway would have it,
as England's object.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It would be easy to dismiss Woolf's analogy between the bodies of
European and third-world women in <I>The Voyage Out</I>, not to mention
her suggestion that Helen's "profound and reasonless law" can sum up
everything from globalization to the shaping power of sexual norms
(<I>VO</I>, 250). Yet it is this vision of overdetermined global
domestication that pushes Woolf toward her most provocative encounter
with empire. For even as the rest of the novel discounts the possibility
of stepping beyond one's own culture, Woolf struggles to find a way
for Rachel to identify with the native women without finding herself
complicit in their subjection. Although Woolf's use of race as a stage
on which to understand gender partially reproduces colonial ideology
by remaking the natives in Rachel's image, the faint acknowledgment of
the native women's perspective in the momentary glimpse of the tourists
as "tight-coated soldiers" keeps her from becoming a subtler version
of Evelyn, who imagines herself a great captain "sent to colonise the
world" (<I>VO</I>, 251-52). That trace of autonomous subjectivity
also suggests Woolf's desire to grasp what she fails to imagine in her
diary entry and her subsequent fiction: an acknowledgment of racial
difference that remains untainted by hierarchy. It seems that what
Woolf wants to effect in the native village but cannot is a suspension
of imperial ideology in the act of representing it, or what Althusser
called the internal distanciation of ideology. Instead, by populating
the blank spots in her own private South America with postcard images,
Woolf infects Rachel with a fatal strain of the cultural disease James
Douglas saw spreading across the globe: Rachel can't help either stepping
into a picture postcard or snapping one.

Postcard Collection or the African Postcard Collection, Manuscripts and
Archives, Yale University Library. Some cards can be dated precisely
via postmarks; the approximate dates of others can be inferred from
their resemblance to other cards and from their design. All the cards
used in this essay date from the first decade of the century. I thank
the Yale Library for their kind permission to reproduce cards from the
collections and William Massa in particular for his assistance in sorting
through these massive holdings.

If Woolf visited London's Imperial International Exhibition 1909, her
impressions of it are not extant. Yet in her account of the British Empire
Exhibition, "Thunder at Wembley," Woolf notes that "At Earls Court and the
White City, <I>so far as memory serves</I>, there was little trouble from
[nature]" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3: 411; emphasis added). The White City was first
built for the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition and then refurbished for the
1909 exhibition, the first international exhibition held in London since
the Great Exhibitions of 1851 and 1861. Woolf also refers to the Earls
Court Exhibition facilities in her letters and essays. See <I>EOVW</I>,
2:290; <I>LOVW</I>,3:95; and Virginia Woolf, <I>Granite and Rainbow:
Essays</I> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1958), 214. Woolf's attention

that "Every exhibition resulted in a flood of postcards: souvenir cards,
advertisers' cards and official cards." Robert W. Rydell adds that by the
time "the 1900 Exposition Universelle closed its gates in Paris, picture
postcards had become as deeply ingrained in the exposition experience as
Ferris wheels, the Eiffel Tower, and ethnological villages" (Rydell,
"Souvenirs of Imperialism," in <I>Delivering Views</I>, 52). For

Forster's account of the same muddy event in "The Birth of an Empire"
is similarly informed by class distinctions. Often casting himself as a
mildly dazed spectator, Forster is also poised to step back from imperial
spectacle: paying customers exit an attraction "in little spouts, like
steam from an exhaust," implying that they, unlike the mocking highbrow
journalist, are simply fuel for what Forster considers the "true denizens

Originally brought to the New World by West African slaves, the banjo
entered into white urban culture in the mid-nineteenth century via
minstrel shows and enjoyed a craze in England and America from about
1890 to 1930. The popularity of minstrel shows evidently transformed the
banjo into a signifier of blackness, for by the late nineteenth century,
as the banjo began to be incorporated into light classical music,
Joel Chandler Harris (author of the Uncle Remus tales) felt compelled
to minimize the slave origins of the instrument in a controversial
article in <I>The Critic</I> in 1883. See Jay Scot Odell, "Banjo,"

Often it is impossible to tell whether a postcard was actually mailed
or simply brought home as a souvenir; postmarks alone do not tell the
story because some cards, particularly those featuring risqu&eacute;
pictures, were mailed in envelopes.

An inscription on the back of the West African card entitled "Motherhood"
(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_0.html">10</A> testifies to a related
anxiety: "Dear Kath, Isn't this friccan nice. If they only stayed
like this. Love Auntie Bell." Possibly the West African woman prompted
Auntie Bell to bemoan the exhausting and largely female labor of child
rearing. But the remark also bespeaks an English need to assert imperial
control over subject races, here expressed as the desire to make Africa
truly be, as Hegel claimed it was, "the land of childhood . . . lying
beyond the days of self-conscious history." See G. W. F. Hegel,
<I>Philosophy of History</I>, quoted in <I>The Post-Colonial Studies
Reader</I>, ed. Bill Ashcrost, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin (London
and New York: Routledge, 1995), 15. Nigeria would not be born for another
sixty years, but already, with images of West African women and children
flowing into England, boundaries between domestic and the colonial spaces
were eroding, and the casual ugliness of Auntie Bell's remark discloses
British anxieties about what it would mean to let these subject people
reproduce, in freedom.

Mrs. Flushing's crassly cynical intuition that something has happened

Sander Gilman's persuasive argument that nineteenth-century perceptions
of racial otherness and inferiority were typically projected onto
the image of the sexualized black woman provides a suggestive context
for the telos of Rachel's journey. On one hand, the longstanding link
between untrammeled sexuality and blacks underscores through antithesis
the domestic binding of female sexuality in Woolf's native village. On
the other hand, late nineteenth-century representations of the sexualized
black female as "the source of corruption and disease" suggest a submerged
symbolic linkage between Rachel's entry into the village and the fever
that kills her. See Sander Gilman, "Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an
Iconography of Female Sexuality in Late Nineteenth-Century Art, Medicine,
and Literature," in "<I>Race," Writing, and Difference</I>, ed. Henry

For the history of Woolf's multiple manuscripts and revisions,
see DeSalvo, <I>Virginia Woolf's First Voyage</I>. The scene in
<I>Melymbrosia</I> is much shorter and simpler (the description of the
women is about a third as long) and focuses much more on the purchase
of artifacts than on the tourist's elusive emotional response to the
encounter; Rachel feels her happiness "dashed" after looking at the
women, explaining to Terence that "it makes us seem so small," but the
comparatively flat and undeveloped scene does not describe anyone else's
reactions (<I>M</I>, 212). The amplification and increasing complication
of the scene in revision carries considerable biographical resonance:
Woolf rewrote the scene after she became engaged to Leonard Woolf and
as she was reading the manuscript of his first novel, <I>The Village
in the Jungle</I> (London: Eward Arnold, 1913), which recounts stories
of mismatched couples, sadism, and doomed wives in the exotic jungles
of Ceylon. Like <I>The Voyage Out</I>, <I>The Village in the Jungle</I>
also features a great deal of hostile staring, in this instance directed
toward two native sisters who were apparently modeled on Virginia and
her sister Vanessa.

All references are much clearer in <I>Melymbrosia</I>: "The woman was
sent to fetch biscuits drink and scented sweetmeats. She made a sign of

and formal, like soldiers in the midst of a crowd" (<I>M</I>, 211).

By comparing Rachel's playing to "an unfortunate old dog going round
on its hind legs in the rain" (<I>VO</I> 277), Terence steps into the
long line of canine denigration of women that Woolf, citing Nick Greene,
Dr. Johnson, and her contemporary Cecil Gray, glances at in <I>A Room
of One's Own</I> . See Virginia Woolf, <I>A Room of One's Own</I>

The parallel between Rachel and the native women is anticipated earlier
in the novel by a complex allusion to <I>Heart of Darkness</I> in which
a letter from Rachel's father, described in a Conradian turn of phrase as
"robbing a whole continent of mystery" (<I>VO</I>, 182), echoes Marlow's
encounter with an accountant who has forced native women to learn how to
wash and starch his shirts and collars. Just as Woolf insistently links
micro and macro politics, Conrad connects the imposition of domestic labor
with large-scale colonial atrocities by linking the accountant to Kurtz.

Woolf played with racialized cross-dressing by touring the British
battleship in blackface at the very time she was expanding in revision
the scene in the indigenous settlement. Quentin Bell reproduces a picture
of the costumed and blackened pranksters in <I>Virginia Woolf</I> (New
York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1972), between pp. 140 and 141. Woolf
critics almost invariably discuss the hoax only in terms of gender and
sexuality and consequently emphasize its subversiveness. Jean E. Kennard,
however, points out that the conjunction of class and race in the
hoax--they dress as royalty after all--complicates Kathy Phillips's
claim that the African costume betokens Woolf's identification with
oppressed groups. See Jean E. Kennard, "Power and Sexual Ambiguity: The
<I>Dreadnought</I> Hoax, <I>The Voyage Out</I>, <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>

The tension between granting the women independent subjectivity
and transforming them into natural objects is more pronounced in
<I>Melymbrosia</I>. On one hand, the texture and feel of the English
hands that receive sweetmeats from the natives is rendered from the native
perspective (see note 48). On the other hand, "Their faces were an oily
brown, and this perhaps explained why they did not look like faces;
they seemed neither old nor young, neither clever malicious women,
or sweet sympathetic women; they seemed more like fruit hung high up
in their own forest trees. She owned that she knew nothing about them"
