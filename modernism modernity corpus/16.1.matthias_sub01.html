<div id="body">
<p>Some years ago, the question of pure poetry began to be debated in our literary discussions. In 1926 or thereabouts, we wanted the poet to be spontaneous and uplifting. Now we sometimes want him to be "pure"—and sometimes we do not. Although I could never clearly understand the problem as it is set forth in Greece, it seems to me that we Greeks have a tendency to call pure poetry not works written prior to Karyotakis but those that came after his <span style="font-style:italic;">Elegies and Satires</span>.<a name="fs1-text" href="#fs1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, it seems to me that we assess the quality of these poems not through comparison to other poems, but according to a defined theory of poetry. The danger of this procedure is that it can be misleading: a person may be under the erroneous impression that he is evaluating a poem when in fact he is denigrating or propounding an aesthetic dogma.</p>
<p>I would not have used the term "pure poetry" if it did not cover, according to the way we perceive it, the entire problem of European poetry during the past fifty or sixty years. And it is time to arrive at somewhat clear and verifiable conclusions about this poetry. I fear that, as time passes, it will be increasingly difficult to agree on questions regarding poetry, either of our own time or of any other time, if we do not understand the efforts, the difficulties, and the goals of poets who, no matter how different from each other, have remarkable similarities in their contributions to the total picture of the art as we see it. Whether or not we like that picture is an entirely different matter; and I am not inclined to believe that there does not exist any other path besides the one which these poets followed. On the contrary, for the true artist there is always some other path. But we must try to understand better exactly what it is we are talking about.</p>
<p>Of course, it would not be impossible to give a few broad definitions of contemporary poetry. But I fear lest the definition would irrevocably supplant the very thing it defines. This danger is very real in our country, where not only do we ignore, as a rule, the works which I am attempting to determine, but where it is also difficult for us (I mean, of course, a public that surpasses a hundred readers) to agree regarding the impressions we receive from those works we happen to know. Naturally, I do not expect that all of us agree in the acceptance or rejection of any specific thing that might come to our awareness. I mean only that there does not yet exist in Greece—not even regarding our own concerns—that somewhat deep-rooted, basic agreement without which each dissent degenerates into pointless turmoil. Of course, a tacit agreement on basic principles is implied in every discussion. Without it, we might have many parallel monologues—but we do not have a <span style="font-style:italic;">dialogue</span>. For the moment, we are the nation of parallel monologues.</p>
<p>When I speak of contemporary poetry, I mean that stretch in the development of the poetic art which begins with Charles Baudelaire, reaches a first milestone with French symbolism, and continues up to our "postwar" era. Its underpinning is French. But if we wanted to muse for a little while on the role of intellectual crossbreeding in the life of nations, we could point out strange yet sufficiently illuminating—albeit hotly <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  contested—foreign influences on Greek art. We encounter writers striving to express their unique individuality who feel stronger bonds with creators outside the province of their own language. These creators, in turn, help our writers to find within our own national tradition the most original and least exhausted fonts of inspiration. Remy de Gourmont writes, "Every time you observe a movement in a national literature, search outside the boundaries of that literature to find the force that animates it." Baudelaire, reading Poe, finds entire sentences expressed precisely as he himself had conceived them. Nonetheless, he is the first representative of the romantic movement to refer to the French tradition of the seventeenth century. The elements that molded the great generation of symbolism belong to all peoples, including our very own Papdiamantopoulos. <a name="fs2-text" href="#fs2"><sup>2</sup></a> Be that as it may, the symbolist movement yielded forms that are distinctly French, such as the works of Mallarmé or Verlaine, even while its radiance extended to all the major European literatures. The debt which as important a poet as R. M. Rilke owed to symbolism is well known. But the manner in which French literature paid back its debt to Anglo-Saxon literature is somewhat more original.</p>
<p>Contemporary literature, to limit myself to its recent history, was introduced to England through the narrow gate. The people who cultivated it were not even English, to tell the truth, and most lived far away from that country, which continues to insist on being an island. Among its most important masters—W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot—two are Irish, two American, and two of their most important works were banned in England and in America. Nearly all of them went through considerable periods of wandering, and Eliot, in one of his earliest French poems, satirizes himself through a paraphrase of Tristan Corbière as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>En Amérique, professeur;<br>En Angleterre, journaliste;<br>C'est à grands pas et en sueur<br>Que vous suivrez à peine ma piste.<br>En Yorkshire, conférencier;<br>A Londres, un peu banquier,<br>Vous me paierez bien la tête.<br>C'est à Paris que je me coiffe<br>Casque noir de jemenfoutiste.<br>En Allemagne, philosophe<br>Surexcité par Emporheben<br>Au grand air de Bergsteigleben;<br>J'erre toujours de-ci de-là<br>A divers coups de tra là là<br>De Damas jusqu'à Omaha.<br>Je célébrai mon jour de fête<br>Dans une oasis d'Afrique<br>Vêtu d'une peau de girafe.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>On montrera mon cénotaphe<br>Aux côtes brûlantes de Mozambique. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Nonetheless, the decisive—and most fruitful—influence on Eliot's oeuvre was exerted by Jules Laforgue: bitter feelings beneath a humorous, dispassionate exterior; common-place details with the potential to stir powerful emotions; a thirst for the absolute that ends up in nihilism; images full of realism blended with a sense of emotional isolation; poetry of a jester, in which scholarly terms and erudite expressions are used to cover up a Hamlet-like indecisiveness; music full of dissonances, just like psychology. We, too, got to know something of this mood through the poetry of Karyotakis. The verse from "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" that was so admired around 1915—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons<div class="attrib">—is not so different from the verse of Karyotakis's <span style="font-style:italic;">Elegies</span>—</div></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>or if you would measure the depth<br>of your empty head with a hair pin!</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">One begins as one can. Eliot himself admitted that he began to write in a form emerging from a study of Laforgue and of late Elizabethan drama. "The lion is made up of all the sheep it has digested" ("Le lion est fait de mouton assimilé"), said Valéry. If the lion were to start bleating, it would seem very strange to us, but only for a little while. Therefore, it is more interesting to study the personality of Eliot as it emerges in his first poems under the influence of his French ancestor. The differences are significant in the articulation of a thought in its final expression, I would say. The tone is deeper, the rhythm more deliberate, more tightly structured without twists and turns. The images are more rugged, better fitted together, with less ornamentation. Laforgue says the following about the sun:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Ce soir un soleil fichu gît au haut du coteau,<br>Gît sur le flanc, dans les genêts, sur son manteau.<br>Un soleil blanc comme un crachat d'estaminet<br>Sur une litière de jaunes genêts,<br>De jaunes genêts d'automne.<br>--<br>Et il gît là, comme une glande arrachée dans un cou,<br>Et il frissonne sans personne! . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p>And Eliot:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Let us go then, you and I,<br>When the evening is spread out against the sky<br>Like a patient etherised upon a table . . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The kinship between these two images is obvious. So is the difference. In the following lines from the same poem ("The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"), there is no longer any evidence of an original influence still exerting energy, of a kind of sound that seems <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to lie between two voices and irritates with its ambiguity. It is more like assimilated Shakespeare, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br>By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br>Till human voices wake us, and we drown.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The process of assimilating foreign elements, which we discern to a greater or lesser degree in every artist, is particularly interesting in the case of Eliot because it is one of the most characteristic aspects of his work. The apprentice who left behind in Boston a society altogether uncivilized yet refined far beyond the limits of civilization found his mentor at the age of twenty. His first published poem is nothing other than an exercise upon a given theme:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>You, madam, are the eternal humorist<br>The eternal enemy of the absolute . . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">These lines could have appeared in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Imitation de Notre Dame la Lune</span>. But this is an isolated case. Immediately afterwards, one can discern parallel tendencies which might end up in similar outcomes—in any case, temporary for Eliot—but of a different caliber. The hesitations, the twists and turns, the boredom, and the despair are not—as in the case of Laforgue—the consequences of the tortured sensitivity of a practically virginal adolescent. Much more than that: they are the reactions of a soul which carries within itself a kind of biblical sense of doom. One recalls, almost involuntarily, the resistance against voluptuousness and the moral complexes of another writer burdened with a puritanical heritage, Eliot's predecessor André Gide. But in the case of Eliot, the resistance is grim, and disgust follows right along. Except for the poem, "La ia che Piange" (the only one I happened to see in anthologies of respectable literature), there does not exist in Eliot's entire oeuvre another portrait of a girl, bearing any resemblance to nearly all of the heroines of Laforgue. It is true that the bitter recollection of nakedness left by a mowed-down adolescent love—"<span style="font-style:italic;">o quam te memorem virgo</span>"—runs through all of his poetry. We find it once more addressed directly to the hyacinth girl in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, and perhaps even later in the poem, "Marina" (compare <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hollow Men</span>, as well), or suddenly, at the very end of a set of cohesive images, we find:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>With the smell of hyacinths across the garden<br>Recalling what other people have desired . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">or:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>Infinitely suffering thing. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">But such verses are nothing more than delicate traces surrounding the loneliness of a city dweller who pieces together, with "old English humor . . . terribly serious," narrow, dirty streets, cheap restaurants, decrepit beds, worn-out women, high-strung ladies, psychological resistances plaguing an aging body, days burned out like cigarette butts, derailments of memory—"the thousand sordid images of which your soul was constituted"—chilled ashes within a sensation akin to voluptuousness.</p>
<p>It is difficult for each person to rid himself of the invisible dance of the old men who pursue him his whole life long. The arduous struggle against his forbears—the Puritan refugees who sought religious freedom in New England—was to become Eliot's struggle, as well. His initial condemnation of Puritanism and his subsequent conversion to the Anglican faith, as well as his fixation on Mediterranean personalities like that of Dante, show this struggle quite clearly. "Milton's celestial and infernal regions," he writes somewhere, "are large but insufficiently furnished apartments filled with heavy conversation; and one remarks about Puritan mythology an historical thinness."<a name="fs3-text" href="#fs3"><sup>3</sup></a> But even though the old men sometimes change aspect, rarely do they truly die. Eliot's brand of Catholicism always retains a trace of puritanical reproof, as well as a trace of the priggish moralizing of a sermon, elements from which works of Catholic origin dating from flourishing epochs are exempt, such as the poetry of Villon, or even the sculpture of Gothic churches.</p>
<p>Nor, to an even greater degree, do we find in Eliot that all-embracing tolerance proffered by Claudel. Of course, such comparisons are arbitrary and can lead to error if they are not preceded by the clear establishment of parameters. But what I want to note here is that I could hardly imagine a person of the Catholic faith without his Paradise, or a Paradise somewhere nearby, and that if Eliot gets beyond the circles of Hell, he does so only to enter Purgatory. His poetry always revolves around the notion of "anti"—or, at least, it is in the instances when it does that it yields its greatest rewards, in my opinion. Indeed, it seems to find its redemption when it is sunk into the realm of purification: "<span style="font-style:italic;">nel foco che li affina</span>." Perhaps this fire is also the fire that brings Eliot hope. But it seems to me that in most—as well as in the most important—of Eliot's poems, the poetic redemption is relinquished, as is the case with the characteristic ending of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, with a gesture corresponding to that of Arnaut Daniel at the moment when he is consumed by "the purifying fire." The last reverberation that is left with me after reading these poems by Eliot bears a strange resemblance to the works of the poet from Provence before he is once again consumed by flames: "Remember my pain when your hour comes—<span style="font-style:italic;">sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor</span>." In such cases, the concept of redemption acquires a Catholicity we rarely encounter in his other poems, poems in which he attempted to express religious hope. Thus, among the poems of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ash Wednesday</span>—even though it is not a poem of lower poetic art—we encounter abundant evidence of the difficulties he had to face. And "the silent sister veiled in white and blue" and "the three white leopards" might well be beautifully decorative, but one could hardly attribute to them a greater significance.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is due to the fact—as Eliot himself notes—that the gift of poetry is rare; rare too is the capacity for religiously motivated emotions at their greatest intensity . . . <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and rarer still is the coexistence of those two faculties in the same individual. It might well be that this is a case of mutually exclusive functions: though they may at times borrow certain elements from each other, nonetheless each of them remains entire and finds its fulfillment through distinctly separate faculties. But it might be more prudent for one to follow the advice of the old teacher—namely, that one misunderstands a writer when one feels hostile to him. Thus, even though I was unable to avoid writing the above lines, I will leave psychological commentary to people who have studied, in greater depth than myself, questions concerning God's justice and omnipotence in view of the existence of evil.</p>
<p>In the more specific context of literature, this characteristically Eliot-esque awareness of decay is not unrelated to the feelings of another great disgusted writer: Flaubert. The following excerpt by Eliot would not surprise us in the least if it were found instead among Flaubert's correspondence: "The natives of that unfortunate archipelago," writes Eliot in 1923 about the population of Melanesia,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>are dying out principally for the reason that the 'Civilization' forced upon them has deprived them of all interest in life. They are dying from pure boredom. When every theatre has been replaced by 100 cinemas, when every musical instrument has been replaced by 100 gramophones, when every horse has been replaced by 100 cheap motor-cars, when electrical ingenuity has made it possible for every child to hear its bedtime stories from a loud speaker, when applied science has done everything possible with the materials on this earth to make life as interesting as possible, it will not be surprising if the population of the entire civilized world rapidly follows the fate of the Melanesians.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And Albert Thibaudet notes regarding <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span>, that no book is more closely connected to the depths of Flaubert's existence; the source of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span> goes back still further, to the time when Flaubert and his little sister would go to look through the window at the corpses in the amphitheater of the Hotel-Dieu, at the time when Flaubert could not see, as he avowed, a living person without thinking of his corpse. <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span> is a painting of the realities, the knowledge, the desires of mankind seen through the vantage point of the corpse, seen at the very moment that they themselves are to become corpses. And nothing comes closer to a corpse, spiritually and physically, than the old age of two idiots. But, by then, for a long time already, Flaubert was unfortunately more able to observe old age in himself than in others. As he himself said in a thousand different ways, he was born an old man. He carries old age within him.</p>
<p>And Eliot, observing a woman of easy morals, thinks of Webster, who saw the skull behind the skin, and perhaps Eliot was born old, as well. "Mr. Prufrock" (in the poem published when the poet was 27 years old) does not dare to confess his love, as he takes stock of his body's decay; five years hence, he will have become "Gerontion"; later, the ancient Tiresias, and later still Simeon, who exclaimed: "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace." Everything can be interpreted in psychological terms. But what really matters here is not what our virtues, our faults, or our own difficulties may be, but rather what we have done with what was given to us by God and men. What <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  really matters is not what ancestral traits brought a poet to the point where he had to take a stance, either of acceptance or rejection, but that through those ancestral traits he was able to create a work of poetry. And in this work—whether or not he himself was "an old man in a dry month"—Eliot created himself, grafting himself drop by drop, just like Flaubert—and like Flaubert, in an impersonal work. If the death of an era found a spokesman attuned by nature to death, so much the worse for that era.</p>
<p>Until he came to the point of writing "Gerontian"—which is his first verse written in a purely Eliot-esque style—he was either experimenting with form, along with his friend Ezra Pound ("the best craftsman," <span style="font-style:italic;">il miglior fabbro del parlar materno</span>"), on the model of the four-line stanza of Théophile Gautier, or he was writing a few poems in French, for which I at least can find no other explanation than that they were written as a drill in transposing from one language into another. His poems, until the end of the war, are either caricatures of the incurable mediocrity of certain vulgar types, such as Sweeney, or turn hopelessly towards the fulfillment of a life forever lost—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Where are the eagles and the trumpets?<br>    Buried beneath some snow-deep Alps?</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">—or they meet the skeleton at the edge of the senses, or move, independently of the generalization that can be applied to artistic expression, within the circle of a personal drama. Peace has given to the world the capability of looking more deeply into its hopelessness. In France, where the spirit traditionally maintains a stance of aloof independence, the total negation had already broken into the intellectual realm. Perhaps in England, the conditions lent themselves better to the expression of post-war despair in a manner more directly human. In certain cases, for Eliot, death is no longer a personal feeling; it is all the dying things that surround him because the entire world is squalid. With "Gerontian," with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hollow Men</span>, with "Sweeney Agonistes," with the series of poems that ends with "Difficulties of a States-man," Eliot, like nobody else, gave, if not the epic of an era, as has been written, at least the epic of a pivotal feeling of a moment in history, of an emotion that we all felt, whether we want to keep on living now or whether we want to die. If he did nothing else, at least he did this: he burned a few bridges behind him. At the moment when putrefaction was spreading all around him, he felt it and he bellowed it out. After Eliot, we can do whatever we want, but we can no longer turn back toward some things that are already rotten. And the spot of isolation has become abominably narrow. This is no small matter. They leveled against him the accusation that he abandons the reader within the dry, barren <span style="font-style:italic;">Waste Land</span>, alone, without the hope of salvation. This would be true if Eliot had not created poetry. No matter how despairing it might be, poetry always rescues us, in some way, from the turbulence of passion. But looking at it from another perspective, even if we were not to acknowledge, as do all those who agree with the poet in all of his conclusions, that the devout portion of his work is not sufficient to counterbalance the elements of despair that he proffers to us, I would look for the cause of this among Eliot's successors, among those who took off from the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  point at which he himself was able to arrive. And they speak to us about death, but in a somewhat different and more decisive tone.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>If we really want to live, we'd better start at once to try;<br>If we don't it doesn't matter, but we'd better start to die.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Thus spoke one among the more recent, W. H. Auden. Both ambiguity and hesitation have become difficult.</p>
<p>Eliot . . . is a difficult poet. But first of all I would like to call to mind that all poetry is by definition difficult, noting however that whereas in bygone times poetry gave us the deceptive feeling that we understand, now it leaves us no escape route. Confronted with the problem of ease versus difficulty, I would say that the lines—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>there will be a day when the holy city of Troy will lament<br>and so will Priam and the people of melodious-voiced Priam</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">—are as difficult for to grasp poetically as these lines of Mallarmé:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Une sonore, vaine et monotone ligne.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The only difficulty is that the first example leaves something to be desired if it is translated into prose, whereas the second leaves nothing. But our capability of substituting one thing for something else does not, of course, alter in the least the substance of the thing itself.</p>
<p>Before we blame the poets for the incomprehensible forms that they confront us with, it would be fair to acknowledge that they have the basic right to be judged, just like other artists, according to the rules of their art and according to the difficulties which their material forces them to face. They are entitled to this. On many occasions, we hear extremely educated people admit that they do not understand this or that piece of music, which however seems very simple to understand for whomever has even a slight acquaintance with music. And if we tell them that they do not understand the work because they do not understand music in general, they do not snub us as a result. However, if one were to say to the same person that he does not find meaning in a poem (what is the <span style="font-style:italic;">meaning</span> of a painting?) because he does not understand poetry, he considers it a personal affront, as if someone had called him illiterate. And the odd thing is that, at the point we have reached today, it is very likely that illiteracy would help rather than hinder the understanding of poetry. Because the first misunderstanding derives from the fact that poems are written in letters, just like travelogues and advertisements for drugs. And it would be preferable that poems have the good luck to fall into the hands of a reader who is not used to numbing his brain—like the majority of half-educated people—with the inexhaustible printed matter that assails the cultured person every day. This half-educated person, most of the time, asks that art <span style="font-style:italic;">speak</span> to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  him or that it <span style="font-style:italic;">resemble</span> something, whereas a work of art, in any event, <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> something with which we either can, or cannot, establish contact.</p>
<p>I do not mean to imply that poetry should not communicate rational meaning. The only thing I maintain is that the existence of that meaning is often unrelated to the poem's value as such, and that it is a sign of bad judgment, or of a bad method, to begin approaching poetry from its rational meaning. And, above all, I maintain that poetry is meant to be recited and to be heard. Even though today, we are accustomed to reading only with our eyes, we must first of all approach poetry as oral if we truly aspire to arrive at an understanding of it. Because that is its source and that is its "race": the spoken word, which, in the remotest corner of its origin, meets the "savage beating on a drum in the jungle," to quote Eliot. And if we look in that direction to discover the difference between poetry and prose, I imagine that our toil will not be in vain. For example, poetry utilizes silence as one of its constructive elements; it is indeed made of words and silence; it sculpts silence in some sort of way. Prose is a silent art; it unfolds within the silence. It contains interruptions; nonetheless, it cannot have silences. Usually, the kind of prose that invites recitation, poetic prose, is bad prose. Equally true, poetry that does not invite recitation is bad poetry. And yet, how few readers of poetry feel the need to hear them in order to understand them? And, among them, fewer still know how to listen to them!</p>
<p>As an expression of spoken rhythm, poetry addresses itself to the whole person—his senses, his feelings, and his mental processes, as the molders of his feelings. Poetry demands a response from the whole person, from him who gives himself to it with the greatest immediacy, without stopping to contemplate whether or not he really understands. We do not understand precisely when we fear we will not understand. This fear is the greatest obstacle to making contact with poetry. In the absence of this fear, understanding comes later, on its own—and gradually, as always. The adage that "poetry is an attitude towards life," means, I imagine, many things, but it also means this: a pose, in the sense that we use the word when we speak about statues. The poet constructs man vis-à-vis life, and in the final analysis that is how I perceive Aeschylus when, at the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Oresteia</span>, the procession of Eumenides disappears from view:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>    Zeus the all-seeing<br>with Destiny has now concurred.<br>Singing and dancing follow our footsteps all.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">But our own world is a far cry from the ancient Greek city state or from the organized societies whose members flocked to the theater to see the dramas of Shakespeare or Racine. Ours is a world in dissolution, a sick and benumbed world, a world in which the sensations evaporate and lose their touch with reality, assailed by a chaotic multitude of impressions, a world in which a man trying to coordinate those sensations does not find solid ground to step on anywhere except within himself. The feeling of the unreality of the individual is characteristic among contemporary writers. One could <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  observe the reactions to these kinds of feelings in works of such dissimilar personalities as those of Eliot, André Malraux, or D. H. Lawrence. Even more characteristic is the tendency towards monologue—interior monologue. And speaking to oneself is not so very different from speaking in a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>I would not like one to suppose that I believe that poetry has become a private matter. I would like to observe only that instead of saying that poetry has reached the point where it negates communication, it would be much more fitting to muse about a world in which <span style="font-style:italic;">communication</span> has become so difficult that it dictates the existence of so difficult an art. If there be one being all of whose powers push it towards communication, that being is the poet. With the only caveat that the poet is not free—and that is precisely why he claims his independence—to prefer another expression besides the one, the only one, imposed on him by the material he must express without ceasing to be an artist. And his material is exceedingly complex. Because, apart from the phenomenon of social dissolution that ever more excludes the existence of shared feelings, it is not only the violent and swift impressions from outside that heap themselves upon each other, tearing each other to pieces ("contemporary perception of rhythm has been affected by the internal combustion engine," as Eliot would say), but even more a kind of inner excavation, hitherto inconceivable, which has now honed the artist's sensitivity to an even more painful sharpness. This communication is something that the artist sought in our time, as best he could, and if at times he was compelled to step, like the mystics, outside the parameters of this world, or to deny his physical existence in order to practice his art, if at the end of his strenuous effort he found silence, let us not rush to condemn him. Let us rather owe him a debt of gratitude because from the midst of his myriad difficulties, he did his best to serve, until his last breath, certain values without which our world would have lost every human quality.</p>
<p>"From the time of impressionism and cubism," writes André Lhote, "art has become profoundly disturbing, with an eruption of technical advances that faithfully reflect inner struggles." The techniques of Mallarmé and Rimbaud, from which to a large extent the contemporary art of poetry derives, are not simple quests for forms; they are human dramas one of which features at its conclusion an act of madness, as Mallarmé once characterized the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coup de dès</span>, and the other ends up in the annihilation of one of the strongest personalities ever known in the annals of poetry. Behind the odd manners and the complications that provoke indignation, time and again a very tragic plot is being played out. What is at stake here is precisely the existence of a man struggling with every drop of his blood to achieve balance among the erratic elements in the world all around him. And together with the existence of that man, who also expresses what we ourselves feel, even without always knowing it, our very own existence is at stake, as well.</p>
<p>The text to which I referred above should be implemented with another observation, by Maritain, which Eliot himself quotes: "Work such as Picasso's shows a fearful progress in self-consciousness on the part of the painting." The changes of mind within a single night (<span style="font-style:italic;">La Jeune Parque</span> by Paul Valéry), the fluctuations of many consciousnesses in a single day in Dublin (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> by James Joyce), the reactions of a conscience at a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  historical moment which encompasses all of civilization (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>): these are not coincidences. They are tragedies played out on the last piece of ground (the souls of a few people), which was left to a deeply fragmented humanity striving to express its most crucial realization, the realization that it is in danger of losing everything.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Car c'est vraiment, Seigneur, le meilleur témoignage<br>Que nous puissons donner de notre dignité . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Eliot's poetry is not obscure, in the sense that one would characterize that of Lycofron.<a name="fs4-text" href="#fs4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the contrary, one of its salient characteristics is an extreme clarity in the details. There is nothing fleeting about its images, no dimness around the feelings it expresses. The means of his expression are always direct and the objects in his scenery contoured with hard lines. Even where it could be difficult for one to transmit the sense of concreteness, he manages to communicate the resistive power of solid matter. The <span style="font-style:italic;">solidity of his dreams</span>, of the feeling of thirst in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, or of revulsion in the chorus, "Clear the air! Wash the wind! Clean the sky!" are striking examples. About the fog and the smoke, he will be able to say:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br>The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes . . .<br>Curled once around the house, and fell asleep.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Besides the way in which his poems hold together, which is primarily based not on logic but on the psychological or emotional coherence of his ideas and his images—things accepted by us and known to us even through the movies—the difficulty in understanding Eliot is mainly due to three hallmarks of his technique.</p>
<p>First: Eliot's poetry—which, in any case, was to end up in the theater—is not lyrical poetry, like that of Mallarmé or Valéry. It is not the "development of an exclamation." It is, essentially, dramatic poetry. And in those of his poems in which this would not become evident at first sight, such as the poem "Marina," we feel as though we have in front of us an excerpt from a drama, rather than a lyrical piece of writing.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>What seas what shores what grey rocks and what islands<br>What water lapping the bow<br>And scent of pine and the woodthrush singing through the fog<br>What images return<br>O my daughter.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">We have a stage before us. As Eliot notes with regard to Seneca, I would say about Eliot that his poems are dramas meant not to be performed in the theater, but to be recited by a narrator. Nonetheless, they are truly dramatic works. This becomes abundantly evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> or in "Difficulties of a Statesman," which is nothing other than a one-act play. Even his words—one can easily detect it—do not have that cohesion in the unfolding of the poem. They do not flow as a complete, harmonious entity, as is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the case with lyrical poetry; instead, they contain within themselves a kind of purely theatrical energy. Consider the word, "unreal" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, for example: if we were to follow its various appearances throughout the work, we would discern that it plays a specific role, that it is, I would say, a kind of code word between two characters. We heard it uttered in act one and it returns in the last act just before the disaster.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br>
Vienna London<br>

			Unreal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I selected the less obvious example. The difficulty inherent in poetry of this kind is that behind the drama that seems to unfold, there is another drama unfolding, parallel to the first but on a deeper level. Here, I will opt for the easier example. In the bar scene of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, we encounter two women in conversation. The waiter announces that it is time for the bar to close for the night. The women part, bidding each other "good night." Nothing could have been more commonplace. And yet the atmosphere that has been created (this, too, a hallmark of Eliot's art) is so intense that when we hear the good night, we feel that something much more portentous is being implied, something like the sinking of a whole world into darkness. The same thing can be said of the cry, "mother," in "The Difficulties of a Statesman," a cry which is one of the most isolated utterances that I have ever chanced to hear. Thus, whereas the more remote meaning of the poem is unified and not at all blurred—blurriness always makes for bad literature—the partial meanings are never aimed at one and only one end. They are two-pronged: meanings which with one foot seem to be stepping in the immediate action we are witnessing, while with the other seem directed to a drama that is unfolding at a far deeper level of consciousness. And the double nature of these objectives is mutually complementary. While on the outside this duality seems to result in a gain in perspective—if my thought is not an exaggeration—it the deeper level it results in a gain in energy.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is a lesser one. It is to be ascribed to the poet's sense of history. For Eliot, history is not whatever has died, but whatever is still living. Living, present, contemporary. The reader is surprised finding Parker the telephone operator next to the Volscian commission, Mrs. Porter and Mr. Eugenides next to Tiresias or Phlebas the Phoenician. However, the same reader has Odysseus by his side, while he is reading Homer, without being surprised in the least, and when I say by his side I do not mean that he has "recourse to the past," but that Odysseus—if Homer endows him with any quality at all—is contemporary with the ocean liner that the reader sees through his window, and with himself.</p>
<p>Writing about Dante, who "has made to fit in real men, his contemporaries, friends, and enemies, recent historical personages, legendary and Biblical res, and res of ancient fiction," Eliot notes that "these, as well as Ulysses, are transformed in the whole; for the real and unreal are all representative of types of sin, suffering, fault, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and merit, and all become the same reality, and contemporary." Eliot's characters are radically changed, as well, and they are contemporary. We will understand this when we get away from analyses, which, no matter how useful, are most useful when one forgets them altogether in order to return to the work itself, and when we accept that the poem is not an assemblage of segments—we always sectionalize it arbitrarily—but rather an organic whole in which constituent elements of both the external and the internal world have been used, and where those elements in confluence are never more as they <span style="font-style:italic;">used to be</span>. They are changed precisely due to the nature of the poem.</p>
<p>The third singularity of Eliot is also connected with his sense of history. It is a matter of the interpolations, or of the paraphrases, from foreign texts one comes across in almost all his poems. Commenting on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, I note that a paraphrased verse of Dante leads the reader to an emotional and mental landscape different from, but complementary to, the emotional and mental world of the original poem. And in both his earlier and in his later works, Eliot made use of this kind of transplantation, but never—and that is precisely why I am citing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> as an example—to such an extent or with such nakedness. In order for one to completely understand this work, one must have a knowledge of the entire poetic corpus, beginning with Sappho, and simultaneously to include in his perusal six or seven different languages. Such a load of references would be enough, as a critic once said, to sink any poem ever written. Nonetheless, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> did not sink, and that shows how difficult it is for one to pinpoint the essential elements of poetry. Today, we can maintain that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> reaches the limits of technique. But we should realize that the term "limit" is only valid until a new poem appears to modify our vista.</p>
<p>I for one find in this technical peculiarity a sense of solidarity, much more than a tendency towards hermitism. Eliot is not an isolated artist, but rather thoroughly within the tradition, as he himself molded it through his own selections. His dominant, his personal tone, carries along with it other voices as well, harmonized with it and colored through it, independent though these voices may remain. In one of his first and most significant critical essays, "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Eliot writes that "the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order." The poet must provide and must constantly develop the consciousness of the past as present and when that is the case, what results is "a continual surrender of himself as he is at the moment to something which is more valuable. The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality." These pronouncements are related to the general question of how poetry functions, and it is not appropriate to examine this subject here. What is noteworthy, however, is that the thought that is expressed critically in the above paragraph finds an objective correlative in Eliot's poetic technique. Just like Tiresias, who is identified with all the characters in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, the poet identifies himself with the poets of the past who, for him, represent tradition. Borrowing from their personalities, on <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the one hand, he denies his own; while, on the other, he enriches it with a deeper perspective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems to me that through this technique, Eliot tried to find in his time something that would play the role of mythology, be it even for a limited public. When myth was a shared experience, the poet had at his disposal a live carrier, a ready-made emotional atmosphere within which he could move freely in order to come near the people around him, an atmosphere in which he was able to express <span style="font-style:italic;">himself</span> sincerely. A single word, the skill of the craftsman notwithstanding, was able to awaken in souls an entire world beset by fears and brightened by hopes. We have nothing in our contemporary languages that might be equivalent in weight or in catholicity of application, or in emotional wealth, to the simple word "semnaiv" (pure, unsullied women) from the time of Aeschylus, or to the two words <span style="font-style:italic;">eterno dolore</span> (eternal suffering) from the time of Dante. I suppose that Eliot sought, above all, from the verses that he either translates or paraphrases, that they provide him with the common carrier which the psychological functioning of mythology offered to the poet in bygone times. This brings me to a more specific observation.</p>
<p>Referring to Shakespeare, he notes that the playwright gives the word a new meaning or extracts from it an esoteric meaning; again and again, the right image, replete with meaning at the depths of Shakespeare's memory, is revealed like Aphrodite from the waves. What gives intensity to a word or to an image is precisely that saturation, that thorough steeping with feelings which is accomplished in the deepest recesses of the poet's soul. And what happens with regard to the word, we can project with regard to verse: "<span style="font-style:italic;">le vers qui refait un mot neuf et comme incantatoire</span>" ("a verse that shapes a word anew and like an incantation"), as Mallarmé said. Verses, just like words, if they penetrate to the deepest recesses of our existence, create around them an emotional halo that transforms them in an altogether personal kind of expression, which is, for each of us, irreplaceable. Similarly and from yet another point of view, we could not say that the foreign words interwoven into Eliot's texts, though they may be distillments of other poets' verses, are foreign elements pure and simple. But I would be more inclined to say that they draw, through a kind of secondary gestation, a tone similar to the personal contribution of the poet and that they harmonize freely within the general atmosphere of his poems.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Eliot has been called a poet of decadence. I really do not know if such poets exist. I suppose there are good and bad poets, and there exist eras that are easier or more difficult for poetry. But if we accept that in the continuum of history, there are eras of highest achievement as well as of decadence, we should consider artists of decadent periods those whose works are somehow identified with their times and which present all the hallmarks of decline. And even that would not be entirely correct either because in each era it is not an entire world that is decadent, but a specific group of institutions and individuals. To put it more succinctly, I imagine that it is precisely a work that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  could elicit the unanimous approval of those people and those institutions that should be dubbed a work of decadence. Thus, within the same era, works of entirely different character can coexist. The folk song is not a work of decadence, whereas a poem in ostentatious <span style="font-style:italic;">katharevousa</span>, composed at the same time, is.<a name="fs5-text" href="#fs5"><sup>5</sup></a> At a time of decadence, a poetry contest takes place to extol the beauty of the bald Queen Stratoniki's hair. The poet who wins the first prize in that contest is, to be sure, a poet of decadence—and that, only under certain circumstances. Be that as it may, it is difficult to classify in the same category the poet who suffers during such an era, who sees it in all its degradation and expresses it in such terms. The poet does not identify himself with the decadence of his era. He prepares the ground for a different tomorrow. That is how I see Eliot's poetry. Even though he began alone and remained "alone with the Only" (the quintessence of himself), in an era of isolation, he was able, by fitting together the smithereens that he found all around him, to give utterance to a "passion." And he expressed this "passion" by making poetry at a time when poetry was a frightfully difficult and desperate undertaking. This is the significance of his service. For beyond historical moments and local circumstances, what matters is that art was able to continue its eternal flow wherever the souls of humankind travel.</p>
<p>The era of doubt, of anxiety, and of isolation seems already to have given its place to the era of need. What the spirit will sprout from within the religious strife gestated by the "time of orthodoxy" which we are entering is "invisible to all except god."<a name="fs6-text" href="#fs6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
