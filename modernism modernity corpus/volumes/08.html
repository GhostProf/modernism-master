J. M. W. Turner once depicted a harbor seen against the light.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He showed the drawing to a naval officer, who remarked that the ships
 had no portholes. "No, certainly not," Turner replied and told the naval
 officer that if he would look at the ships against the sunset, he would
 find he could not see the portholes. The naval officer retorted that
 the artist surely must have known they were there. "Yes," said Turner,
 "I know that well enough; but my business is to draw what I see, and not
 what I know is there." Where the painter's eye perceives sun-drenched
 vessels, the naval officer perceives armed warships. Aesthetic experience
 and practical reason do not inhabit the same world. To observe an object
 from a user's point of view, the anecdote implies, is to engage in a
 perceptual activity radically different from the point of view of a
 spectator who has no interest in the object perceived other than to,
 say, paint it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An influential champion of Turner's late manner, John Ruskin quoted
this anecdote in his treatise on the relations between art and the
natural sciences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 For him, the story epitomized an aesthetic program, whose ultimate
 task was to correct the detrimental effects of industrial society on
 human experience. Ruskin resented many things modern: railway travel,
 for example, fatigued the human sensorium; photography risked making
 the eye too fastidious; and viewing instruments such as the Claude
 glass perverted artistic seeing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anecdote, which Marcel Proust related in the preface to his
translation of Ruskin's <I>The Bible of Amiens</I>, points to one of
many links between the British art critic and the French author.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 A sincere admirer of Ruskin's philosophy of art, Proust

<B></B>

made the spirit of the anecdote into his own. As Jean Autret has
emphasized, it provides a key to the artistic sensibility for which
<I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> becomes a vehicle and that the
portrait of the painter Elstir in particular serves to articulate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Fresh sense perception versus confining intellectual notions: this
 distinction is fundamental to Proust's visual aesthetics. Teaching the
 virtues of the cultivation of sensory experience, <I>Remembrance of
 Things Past</I> articulates a didactics of disinterested perception--of
 seeing for seeing's sake, of listening for the pleasure of sounds,
 and so on. The task of the artist is to be alert to the immediacy of
 sensory experience and, as Proust's narrator underscores in the Elstir
 episode, to restore it by inventing the appropriate metaphor.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Given Proust's reverence for Ruskin, and given his adoption of the
master's belief in the innocence and purity of the painterly eye, one
would expect the author of <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> to reject
mechanical means of visual representation. After all, Proust's novel is
concerned, among many other things, with the discovery by the narrator of
an aesthetic program that rests upon the Ruskinian distinction between
numbing habit and unmediated sensory experience, between agreed-upon
intellectual notions and unbiased forms of comprehension. And true
enough, as the narrator warms to the didactic tasks he has set himself,
particularly in the last volume, <I>Time Regained</I>, he repeatedly
criticizes photography and cinematography, declaring them inferior to
the human eye, the art of writing, and last but not least, the workings
of memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Proust would not be Proust if it were that simple. There is a
tremendously complex and productive relationship between the ideal of
unmediated vision articulated by <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I> and
the author's deployment of photographic and cinematographic techniques
of representing visual experience. For not only does Proust appropriate
such modes of representation; he puts them to use at precisely those
moments where he attempts to elaborate what one may call a phenomenology
of perception, that is, when he seeks to render perceptual activities
that are uninhibited by intellectual preconceptions. Indeed, some of
Proust's boldest stylistic solutions owe their deepest impulses to
machines of vision. Cinematographic means of representation, I want to
argue, are singularly well suited to Proust's ambition to restore sensory
impressions that have not been domesticated by the dulling force of habit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nowhere does this become as clear as in the article "Impressions de route
en automobile." Written in the early fall of 1907 and published in <I>Le
ro</I> on 19 November, the article is based on the motoring trips
Proust had made that same summer with Alfred Agostinelli, the driver
he had hired for the purpose. Together they visited places in Normandy
that Ruskin had written about, such as Bayeux, Conches, Lisieux, and
Caen. Comfortably reclining in the passenger seat, Proust was able
to concentrate on the vistas passing by; the most thrilling ones made
their way into "Impressions de route en automobile." In fact, Proust
was so pleased with the centerpiece of the article--the description
of the church steeples rising above Caen--that he was to recycle it in
<I>Remembrance</I>, in the pages known as the Martinville episode. Widely
thought of as one of the most important and most enigmatic passages the
novel, the Martinville episode relates how the young narrator, sitting
next to the coachman on a horse-driven

<B></B>

carriage, comes to witness how the steeples of Martinville appear to
be dancing on the horizon. Significantly enough, the visual experience
propels the narrator's very first piece of writing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Jean-Yves Tadi&eacute; has suggested, the <I>ro</I> article was an
"embryo of the future work."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Yet "Impressions de route en automobile" merits our attention not
 just because it casts an interesting light on the genesis of Proust's
 novel. Read closely, it complicates the received view of the French
 author's relationship to Ruskin. Although Proust's <I>p&eacute;riode</I>
 <I>ruskinienne</I> is commonly believed to have ended in 1906, the
 motoring article shows that post-Ruskinian Proust was at once more
 Ruskinian and more modernistic than has previously been thought. For
 while the piece is strikingly Ruskinian in spirit, Proust paid tribute
 to his old mentor's aesthetic program in rather unexpected ways--by
 turning Ruskin's anti-modern stance on its head. How can this be? The
 answers will carry us far into Proust's universe. Ultimately, the 1907
 article provides us with a richer understanding of the aesthetics of
 perception that informs <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I>, which he
 began writing the following year.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An episode in the second volume, <I>Within A Budding Grove</I>, takes us
to the heart of the novel's visual aesthetics. The narrator is vacationing
in Balbec, a seaside resort on the Norman coast. One hot summer day he
pays a visit to the atelier of the famous painter Elstir. A fictitious
re, Elstir is a composite of an array of nineteenth-century painters,
first of all Turner, but also artists such as Monet, Whistler, Moreau, and
Vuillard; in addition, Elstir is designed to remind the reader of Ruskin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 No sooner has the narrator entered the studio than he is seized by
 happiness and the prospect of rising to a poetical understanding of
 reality. Elstir's atelier, he proclaims enthusiastically, is nothing
 less than a "laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world . . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The canvases lining the studio, most of them seascapes, makes him
 perceive the sea anew, and the beach and the sky and the foaming
 waves. The experience elicits a piece of art criticism, as spirited as
 it is ingenious: "[Elstir] had extracted, by painting them on various
 rectangles of canvas that were placed at all angles, here a sea-wave
 angrily crashing its lilac foam on to the sand, there a young man in
 white linen leaning on the rail of a ship. The young man's jacket and
 the splashing wave had acquired a new dignity from the fact that they
 continued to exist, even though they were deprived of those qualities in
 which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able
 to wet or the jacket to clothe anyone" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:892-3/2:190).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only has Elstir freed the wave and the jacket from their established
denotations; he has also restored the meanings that habitual perception
prevents the beholder from perceiving. This is to say that the wave and
the jacket, having slipped out of the grip of a reality which revolves
around usage and function, have managed to enter a world of purposeless
beauty. In this way, the narrator intimates that Elstir is not a realist,
much less a naturalist; if anything, the painter is an impressionist--he
is faithful to the visual impression and the immediate ways in which it
comes before him.

<B></B>

He transforms the visible world, at the same time restoring its lost
glory, with the effect that the beholder is taken back to the dawn of
creation: "if God the father had created things by naming them, it was by
taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created
them anew. The names which designate things correspond invariably to
an intellectual notion ["notion de l'intelligence"], alien to our true
impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that
is not in keeping with that notion" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:893/2:191).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The world of phenomena appears as though it had just been born,
for the conventional links between signifier and signified have been
severed. To this end, Elstir's prime means is the painterly equivalent
of the metaphor--the metamorphosis. This is why the narrator seizes on
those seascapes where the contours of land and sea blend and eventually
change places, where the town rising above the sea has been rendered in
"marine terms," and the sea has been depicted in "urban terms." To be
sure, the beholder will eventually recognize the sea and the town, but
through notions not typically associated with them. This is the sense
in which Elstir not only strips things of their common names but also,
and above all, endows them with new ones. And in naming things anew,
the artist invites the beholder to see them anew, richer, fuller, and
more dignified.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The episode also contains an enigmatic description of the studio
itself. The blinds are closed, the atelier plunged in half-light. But
there is one place, the narrator underscores, "where daylight laid
against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; one small
rectangular window alone was open" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:893/2:191). A darkened
chamber, with a small opening providing the only source of light: Elstir's
studio is literally and ratively represented as a camera obscura,
complete with an aperture. The dark room turns into a metaphor for the
artist's power to recreate the world as he pleases.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The painter's eye as camera obscura? The metaphor acquires a peculiar
resonance, as the episode also includes a lengthy reflection upon
the rivalry between painting and photography. The competition with
the mechanically produced image has forced Elstir to reinvent his
painterly aesthetics. This is because photography--"une industrie,"
Proust writes--has banalized traditional art. "Since Elstir began to
paint, we have grown familiar with what are called 'wonderful' [in
French, "admirable"] photographs of scenery and towns" (<I>RTP</I>,
1:896/2:194). The appeal of photography lies in its ability to explode
habitual ways of seeing by estranging seemingly familiar visual domains,
at the same time being a faithful recording of the motif in question:
"If we press for a definition of what admirers mean by the epithet [i.e.,
"admirable"], we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual
image of a familiar object, an image different from those that we are
accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason
doubly striking because it surprises us, takes us out of our cocoon of
habit, and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to
us an earlier impression" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:896-7/2:194).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No matter how pleasing and revelatory photographic means of representation
may be, and no matter how effectively it ruptures habitual modes of
perception, it was

<B></B>

painting, not photography, that was first in the field. Historically
speaking, what characterized painting was its extraordinary ability
to defamiliarize the familiar and to make the beholder look at the
world anew, but the mechanically produced image has now appropriated
this very domain, with the effect that traditional painting appears
obsolete, even lacking in originality. So it is that the sheer existence
of photography forces the art of painting to reinvent itself. In other
words, in suggesting that the superior ability of photography to represent
landscape and urban sceneries has forced Elstir to abandon his classical
motifs, the narrator offers a historical explanation of the painter's
artistic choices. As Anne Henry has underscored, this is all the more
remarkable since Proust, throughout <I>Remembrance</I>, tends to deny
that history may serve as a valid point of departure for explication in
the realm of art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Yet here history is explicitly and insistently evoked--in order to
 explain how Elstir's classical motifs and mode of painting began to
 lose legitimacy and how, as a result, he tries to attain an innocent,
 unbiased, and non-theoretical mode of seeing. In short, he comes to
 celebrate the visual and visionary capacities of the disinterested
 spectator--just like Turner did in his late period and as Monet and other
 impressionists were to do later in the nineteenth century. Nathalie
 Sarraute has captured this sea change in an apt phrase: "since
 Impressionism, all pictures have been painted in the first person."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elstir thus gives priority to the visual impression, not the
intellect. This is why he always attempts to rid himself of all knowledge
(in French, "intelligence") before sitting down to paint. To know
a thing means that the thing ceases to exist in and of itself, the
narrator maintains, an idea that reveals not merely what one may call
a phenomenological strand in Proust's work but also an epistemological
stance, including the ideal of an inductive knowledge of the "essences" of
the world by way of pure perception. That Elstir seeks to remain faithful
to the purely visual aspects of the seen does not mean, however, that his
paintings are necessarily "true" in the ordinary sense of the word; he may
well depict an optical illusion and therefore commit an "error," as when
the sea emerges like a town. But the narrator conceives of such illusions
as <I>prior</I> to the work of the intellect and therefore artistically
true (<I>RTP</I>, 2:194/1:897). For all the immediacy of such optical
errors, however, the artist nonetheless has to <I>unlearn</I> his mode of
seeing in order to be able to see what he actually perceives; in fact,
he has to accustom his eyes ("habituer les yeux") to not recognizing,
for example, that fixed boundary which separates land from sea and so
tells the beholder to identify the town as a town and the waves as waves
(<I>RTP</I>, 2:192-3/1:895). In other words, Elstir's aesthetics
of perceptual innocence presupposes the education of the eye.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator's encounter with Elstir is a key episode in
<I>Remembrance</I>. Like the portraits of the writer Bergotte, the
composer Vinteuil, and the actress Berma, the Elstir episode articulates
crucial aspects of the novel's artistic program. Proust alludes several
times to the studio visit, thus making sure that his readers will not miss
the significance of the crucial insights that the hero takes to heart. For
example, in <I>Within a Budding Grove</I>, the narrator anticipates how
he will come to understand why Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;'s letters
bring him such pleasure, for she "is an artist of the same school as a
painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my ways of

<B></B>

seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same
way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our
perception of them, instead of first explaining them in relation to
their several causes" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:703/2:14). In <I>The Guermantes
Way</I>, moreover, the narrator contemplates Elstir's aesthetics with
a completeness of detail that recalls his reflections during the studio
visit. Invited to a dinner party at the duke and duchess of Guermantes,
he asks to see their Elstir collection and forgets about the social
gathering:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Among these pictures, some of those that seemed most absurd to people
in fashionable society interested me more than the rest because they
recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should
never succeed in identifying objects if we did not bring some process
of reasoning to bear on them. How often, when driving, do we not come
upon a bright street beginning a few feet away from us, when what we
have actually before our eyes is merely a patch of wall glaringly lit
which has given us the mirage of depth. This being the case, it is surely
logical . . . to return to the very root of the impression, to represent
one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we
mistook it. . . . Elstir sought to wrest from what he had just felt what
he already knew; he had often been at pains to break up that medley of
impressions which we call vision. [<I>RTP</I>, 2:434-5/2:712-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further on in the same volume, the narrator makes a comparison between
Elstir and himself: "My imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering
some effect of perspective without reference to the notions of physics he
might well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw" (RTP,
2:590/2:856). Clearly, the narrator is well on his way to incorporating
the painter's aesthetics with his own artistic sensibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet although the Elstir episode relates a crucial discovery, Proust has
carefully, albeit indirectly, prepared the reader for it. The manner in
which Proust describes the long prelude to the visit--the train ride to
Balbec, the atmosphere at the seaside resort, Robert de Saint-Loup's
appearance, and so on--is itself exemplary of the aesthetics that the
narrator discovers in the studio and eventually will make his own. At
this stage in the novel, Proust's stylistic solutions become bolder,
as if to reinforce the point that the narrator's artistic education is
well under way. As we shall see, the hero's surroundings are repeatedly
represented as though they were works of art; sometimes they have even
been furnished with a frame. Moreover, each time the visual impression
takes center stage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider the railway journey which, more than any other episode, works to
warm up the reader. Early in the morning, the narrator wakes up in his
sleeping compartment, and as the train makes its way towards Balbec, he
studies the break of dawn through the square of the window ("le carreau
de la fen&ecirc;tre"). Just above a dark silhouette, he distinguishes
"some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink,
not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the feathers of a wing
that has assimilated it or a pastel on which it has been deposited by
the artist's whim" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:704/2:15). No sooner has the narrator
clapped his eyes on the pink light of dawn than he elevates the sight
to a work of art executed by a willful artist. Moments later,

<B></B>

daylight bursts forth, and a cascade of colors--red, blue, mother of
pearl--appear before the narrator, who readily surrenders to the optical
extravaganza:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The sky turned to a glowing pink which I strove, glueing my eyes to the
window ["la vitre"], to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related
somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but the course of the line
altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of
the window ["le cadre de la fen&ecirc;tre"]  to a nocturnal village, its
roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent
sheen of night, beneath a firmament still spangled with all its stars, and
I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it
anew, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second
bend in the line; so that I spent my time running from one window to the
other to reassemble, to collect on a single canvas the intermittent,
antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and
to obtain a comprehensive view and a continuous picture of it ["une vue
totale et un tableau continu"]. [<I>RTP</I>, 1:704-5/2:15-16]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Framed by the train windows, the view of the sleepy landscape
through which the train travels is represented as a series of
tableaux. Scenery follows upon scenery, as in a montage-cut film. Indeed,
the railway compartment moves through the landscape like a projector
apparatus. Naturalizing the deliciously fragmented representation of the
narrator's visual activity, the window frames permit the spectacle to
come into being. In a word, the train has become a vehicle of perception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is more, the narrator's window gazing promotes an aestheticized
way of seeing to such a degree that when the train makes a stop at a
little station, and he catches sight of a peasant girl selling coffee,
his gaze turns her appearance too into a spectacle. "Flushed with
the glow of morning," he remarks, "her face was rosier than the sky"
(1:705/2:16). The sight exalts him. During the train ride, he has let
go of habitual modes of seeing. He has been exposed to a form of beauty
that falls outside of traditional notions and, for this very reason,
is proof of genuine beauty. Now he wants to take a good look at the
peasant girl, and signals that he would like to purchase a cup of
coffee. As she approaches, his gaze puts her appearance behind glass:
"Above her tall re, the complexion of her face was so burnished and
so glowing that it was as if one were seeing her through a lighted window
["vitrail illumin&eacute;"]. She retraced her steps. I could not take
my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun
which it was somehow possible to stare at and which was coming nearer
and nearer, letting itself be seen at close quarters, dazzling you with
its blaze of red and gold" (<I>RTP</I>, 1:707/2:17-18).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This description is remarkable not for what is says about the girl's
looks--after all, we learn virtually nothing about her--but for what
it reveals about the hero's eye. Elstir would have been pleased. The
moment the narrator fixes his gaze on the young woman, her face turns
into a spectacular light show. He is faithful to what he sees, not to
what he knows, and what he sees possesses all the wondrous powers of
the idiosyncratic artist's eye. Indeed, Proust writes not that the
young woman's face is coming nearer but that it is becoming larger:
"je ne pouvais d&eacute;tacher mes yeux de son visage

<B></B>

de plus en plus large." It is as though we were watching a film in
which the heroine's head approaches the camera and eventually fills the
screen. The peasant girl has become pure image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, why does the narrator remark that it is as though he looked at her
through a lighted window, "un vitrail illumin&eacute;"? At first, the
metaphor may seem like mere embellishment. But Proust needs the image of
the window: it motivates the narrator's framed vision and naturalizes his
aestheticized perspective. Proust makes use of a similar technique when,
a few pages later, he introduces Robert de Saint-Loup, a key character
in the novel. The narrator is sitting in the hotel dining-room when he
catches sight of the young marquis. It is a scorching hot afternoon,
the dining room is "plunged in semi-darkness," and through the gaps
between the drawn curtains the glittering blue sea can be glimpsed. Like
Elstir's studio, the dining room emerges as a <I>camera obscura,</I>
complete with apertures. In this giant dark room, the writer-to-be is
busy registering remarkable sights, developing one after the other with
remarkable artistic skill:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Robert de Saint-Loup] strode rapidly across the whole width of the
hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting
away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach,
and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall
made a background against which he stood out full-length, as in certain
portraits whose painters attempt, without in any way falsifying the most
accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their
sitter an appropriate setting . . . to furnish a modern equivalent of
those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human re
in the foreground of the landscape. [<I>RTP</I>, 1:783-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The snapshot of Saint-Loup is a brilliant portrait, the image of the
fluttering butterfly prering the narrator's futile and constantly
suspended attempts to decipher the "true" nature of the marquis--in the
history of art, we recall, the butterfly signifies <I>psyche</I>, the
human soul. The feature that more than any other propels the narrator's
scopophilic will-to-know is, of course, Saint-Loup's homosexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As in the peasant-girl episode, the sight is framed by the windows
that serve to motivate the delimitation of the narrator's field of
vision. Here, however, the scene is explicitly rendered as a work of
art. The same is true when the narrator enters his hotel room and turns
his eyes toward the window. As in the railway episode, the landscape is
immediately transformed into a series of tableaux, complete with frames:
"Gradually, as the season advanced, the picture [in French, "tableau"]
that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight,
and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass
which it distended with the curve of its rounded waves, the sea, set
between the iron uprights of my casement window like a piece of stained
glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of
the bay little plumed triangles of motionless foam . . ." (<I>RTP</I>,
1:860/2:160).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator hastens to add that the foaming sea recalls Pisanello's
drawings of feathers and down, and that the creamy white background makes
him think of Emile Gall&eacute;'s carefully etched glass objects. Waves
that look like feathers, foam that appears

<B></B>

as down: such a way of seeing is perfectly consistent with Elstir's
program. The narrator's eye fails to perceive the essential difference
between waves and plumage that his mind will soon discover. The task
of the artist is to remain faithful to the seen, to give priority to
the imagination over and above confining intellectual notions, and the
art-historical re who in this respect exercised the single most
important influence on Proust was John Ruskin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proust's interest in Ruskin, the most influential art critic of the
Victorian age, began in 1899.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 During a vacation, he read Robert de la Sizeranne's <I>Ruskin et la
 religion de la beaut&eacute;</I> (Paris: Hachette, 1897).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Interestingly, as Richard Macksey has noted, Proust first invoked Ruskin
 as an "instrumentality of sight," since he sent for Sizeranne's Ruskin
 study in order that he, as he said, might "look at the mountains with
 the eyes of this important man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 On the occasion of Ruskin's death in 1900, Proust wrote an obituary
 notice in <I>Le ro</I>, suggesting that the proper way to pay homage
 to the British art critic was to visit the French cathedral cities he
 had written about, as these now "protect his soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Proust himself was to set out on Ruskinian pilgrimages, particularly
 in Normandy. He also went as far as Italy with Ruskin's writings as a
 guide. Most of these trips have left traces in <I>Remembrance</I>. In
 Padua, for example, Proust made sure to view Giotto's frescoes in the
 Arena chapel, half a century after Ruskin's visit, and the event is
 reflected in <I>The Fugitive</I>, in a remarkable episode--I shall have
 more to say about it later--written long after Proust's <I>p&eacute;riode
 ruskinienne</I> had come to an end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A passionate advocate of Ruskin's theory of art, Proust translated
two of his books into French, <I>The Bible of Amiens</I> (<I>La Bible
d'Amiens</I>, 1904) and <I>Sesame and Lilies</I> (<I>S&eacute;same et
les lys</I>, 1906), both of which he provided with voluminous prefaces
and annotations. What attracted Proust to Ruskin was, among other
things, the emphatic distinction between the observed and the known,
between fresh sensation and dulling habit. "The greatest thing a human
soul ever does in this world is to <I>see</I> something, and tell what
it <I>saw</I> in a plain way," Ruskin writes in his seminal work on
Turner's late manner, <I>Modern Painters</I>. "To see clearly is poetry,
prophecy, and religion,--all in one" (<I>WJR</I>, 5:333; italics in
the original). Stressing that the artist must recover the "innocence of
the eye," Ruskin promoted "a sort of childish perception of these flat
stains of colour, merely as such, without consciousness of what they
signify,--as a blind man would see them if suddenly gifted with sight"
(<I>WJR</I>, 15:27n).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ruskin's hostility to the modernization process runs through all his
writings, a fact, incidentally, that did not escape Proust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Ruskin railed against the "current political economy," including the
 automation of production and the mechanization of labor; and these
 sentiments were integral to his theory of the visual arts. When Ruskin
 championed Turner's art, he argued for the painter's superiority
 by setting up an opposition between the mechanical and natural or,
 alternatively, the mechanical and the spiritual. Contrasting Turner
 with old masters such as Lorrain, Rosa, and Poussin, Ruskin claimed
 that they submitted to mechanical, hence false, reproductions of nature,
 as they failed

<B></B>

to rise above "the daguerreotype or calotype, or any other
mechanical means that ever have been or may be invented" (<I>WJR</I>,
3:169). Therefore, Ruskin concluded, they lacked in love of the phenomena
represented.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Robert Hewison has underscored, Lorrain, Rosa, and Poussin were
associated with the so-called picturesque.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Deriving from the Italian word <I>pittoresco</I>, or "in the manner of
 painters," the specifically British notion of the picturesque came into
 being as a response to the need for a category that complemented Burke's
 distinction between the sublime and the beautiful. Eminently suited to
 the features of the English countryside, the picturesque referred to
 the particular pleasure evoked by natural phenomena that were irregular,
 rough, and wild--without, however, inspiring awe in the spectator.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Cultivating new modes of seeing, it taught antiquarians, tourists, and
 sketchers how to perceive landscape by way of paintings. In effect, then,
 the theory of the picturesque fostered not pure but essentially derived
 ways of seeing. The so- called Claude glass was part of the didactics
 of the picturesque. A pocket-sized black piece of convex mirror-glass,
 this specular instrument framed and reflected the surrounding landscape,
 thus turning the view into something like a picturesque work of
 art. Ruskin's critique of such visual pleasures was relentless. The
 glass, he argued in <I>The Elements of Drawing</I>, is "one of the most
 pestilent inventions for falsifying Nature and degrading art which ever
 was put into an artist's hand" (<I>WJR</I>, 15:201-2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ruskin would nevertheless recommend to his students of drawing the
use of an equally mechanical means of reproducing nature, namely
photography. Photographs were to be copied as a form of exercise and
compared for their "authority" (<I>WJR</I>, 15:100-101; see also
21:294-95). In fact, the young Ruskin--the Ruskin of the picturesque
period--celebrated the advent of daguerreotypy, claiming that it beat
his own talent for drawing. "It is a noble invention--say what they will
of it," Ruskin wrote from Venice in 1845, after having procured a few
daguerreotypes of the palaces he had tried to draw, "and any one who
has worked and blundered and stammered as I have done for four days,
and then sees the thing he has been trying to do so long in vain, done
perfectly and faultlessly in half a minute, won't abuse it afterwards."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Later in his career, as an anti-picturesque critic who promoted Turner's
late manner, Ruskin was to attack photography and its automatisms in
contrast to the inherent virtues of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Artistic seeing was for Ruskin a subjective affair, its empire defined
 by the boundaries of industrial society. For observation to quicken,
 and for sensation to sharpen, he recommended as "little change as
 possible." Ruskin evoked a rural Arcadia lingering in the shadow of
 industrial society:

Proust valued Ruskin's sensibility highly. He adopted Ruskin's belief
in the primacy of sense perception and of the importance of remaining
true to the concrete. He made use of Ruskin's idea that the sensuous
world is a universe of signs that the artist is meant to decipher. Yet,
for all his admiration for the British art critic during the critical
years that preceded his great novel, Proust was nevertheless to invert
Ruskin's attitude toward the historical conditions that had prompted
some of the most important features of the latter's aesthetic program.

The higher the velocity, the more fatiguing travel becomes, Ruskin
maintained. For Proust, the opposite was true. Speed quickened the
eye. Indeed, Proust embraced the new culture of velocity with unmistakable
enthusiasm and was to declare himself a "fervent d'automobilisme,"
a motoring fan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Even when he traveled in the tracks of the British art critic whose
 work and sensibility he had admired for so long, Proust often chose
 to travel by car, turning the ride into an aesthetic experience of
 the first rank. In 1907, when he motored in Normandy, automobiles were
 still something of a novelty. In 1900, as P&auml;r Bergman has observed,
 there were only about 3,000 automobiles in France, a re that had
 risen to 50,000 by 1909, and to 100,000 by 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Like numerous writers, painters, and photographers, Proust marveled at
 how speed helped transform the perception of time and space.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In 1904, for example, the French photographer Robert Demachy captured a
 motorcar racing through a curve on a country road, and soon afterwards,
 the image was reproduced in Alfred Stieglitz's avant-garde art review,
 <I>Camera Work</I>. Entitled <I>Vitesse</I>, the photograph indirectly
 addresses a problem that engaged numerous artists at the time: How
 is an image to convey an impression of speed and movement? That is
 to say, how is an image to represent temporal extension? Moreover,
 can the lived experience of locomotion be put into words?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That same year the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck wrote a short
story about a motoring trip in the countryside. Thanks to the car, the
ecstatic narrator suggests, it has become possible for modern humans to
absorb "in one day, as many sights, as much landscape and sky, as would
formerly have been granted to us in a whole life-time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Set in the neighborhood of Rouen, "In an Automobile" relates how the
 narrator goes for a drive by himself for the first time. He speeds past
 sleepy villages like a missile, cleaving yellow corn fields and red
 poppy meadows. Traveling at a speed of, say, thirty kilometers an hour,
 the motor vehicle turns the quiet country road into a spectacle:

The pace grows faster and faster, the delirious wheels cry aloud in their
gladness. And at first the road comes moving towards me, like a bride
waving palms, rhythmically keeping time to some joyous melody. But soon it
grows frantic, springs forward, and throws itself madly upon me, rushing
under the car like a furious torrent, whose foam lashes my face . . . . It
is as though wings, as though myriad wings no eye can see, transparent
wings of great supernatural birds that have their homes on invisible
mountains swept by the eternal snow, have come to refresh my eyes and
my brow with their overwhelming fragrance! ["IA," 181-82/60-61]

Inert matter is here endowed with anthropomorphic features. All that
seemed solid jumps into motion. In this way, Maeterlinck attempts to
convey a sense of the vertiginous speed with which the motorcar travels
through space. For despite all its impressive horsepower, it is not the
car but nature that acquires agency in Maeterlinck's scenario. It is
nature, not the car, that emerges as a reckless force apparently beyond
masculine control.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Revolving around the thrill of the new, Maeterlinck's short story
emphasizes the miracle of speed and the concomitant transformations of
space. As the vehicle plunges into a valley, the velocity animates the
poor old trees lining the road, and little by little the reader realizes
that the event is of world-historical significance:

The trees, that for so many slow-moving years have serenely dwelt on its
borders, shrink back in dread of disaster. They seem to be hastening one
to the other, to approach their green heads, and in startled groups to
debate how to bar the way of the strange apparition. But as this rushes
onward, they take panic, and scatter and fly, each one quickly seeking
its own habitual place; and as I pass they bend tumultuously forward, and
their myriad leaves, quick to the mad joy of the force that is chanting
its hymn, murmur in my ears the voluble psalm of Space, acclaiming and
greeting the enemy that hitherto has always been conquered but now at
last triumphs: Speed. ["IA," 182-83/61-62]

Thanks to speed, Maeterlinck asserts, man has triumphed over "Space and
Time, its invisible brother" (<I>IA</I>, 183/62). The dust of history

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The French writer Octave Mirbeau also conceived a story glorifying
the horsepower of the motorcar. Mirbeau's 1907 novel <I>La 628-E
8</I>, so named after his license plate, relates a motoring trip through
France. In the opening pages, the narrator turns speed into an emblem
of human consciousness in the modern age:

His brain is a racetrack around which jumbled thoughts and sensations
roar past at 60 miles an hour, always at full throttle. Speed governs
his life: he drives like the wind, thinks like the wind, makes love
like the wind, lives a whirlwind existence. Life comes hurtling
at him and buffeting him from every direction, as in a mad cavalry
charge, only to melt flickeringly away like a film ["et dispara&icirc;t
cin&eacute;matographiquement"] or like the trees, hedges and walls that
line the road. Everything around him, and inside him, dances, leaps,
and gallops, in inverse proportion to his own movement; not always
a pleasant sensation, but powerful, delirious and intoxicating, like
vertigo or fever.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Diagnosing life in the modern age, Mirbeau suggests that two features
characterize the world of the living: an overwhelming experience
of speed and an equally overwhelming mass of visual stimuli. Trees,
walls, silhouettes--everything is flickering before the eyes of modern
humans. Described as a succession of moving images, the world emerges
as a film.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both Maeterlinck and Mirbeau explore the syntax of velocity, seeking to
convey a sort of lived experience to which the medium of the printed word
is stubbornly resistant: the bodily experience of speed. Both writers
thus contemplate a representational

<B></B>

problem: how the formal level of description may call forth what is
suggested on the level of enunciation. And in response to this linguistic
challenge, both writers settle on a rhetoric of inversion, substituting
the immobile for the mobile, and vice versa. Mirbeau even writes that
the movement of human beings stands in inverse proportion to that of
the environment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no coincidence that Mirbeau uses cinema as a metaphor to call forth
how the world incessantly races forward and disappears behind the human
subject, for it is indeed film that offers a model for how to represent
the lived experience of velocity. Early cinema specifically experimented
with ways of creating panoramas that simulated speed and movement. From
a historical point of view, Tom Gunning argues, "camera movement began
as a display of the camera's ability to mobilize and explore space."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Up until 1908, when so-called narrative cinema was more fully developed,
 a vast number of film-makers explored speed and movement by mounting
 a camera on vehicles such as subway cars, streetcars, trains, aerial
 balloons, and gondolas. Predicated on the inversion of mobility and
 immobility, this widespread shooting technique produced an optical
 illusion of movement by suggesting that the environment rushed towards
 the camera and, by implication, the spectator.

As early as 1895, shortly after the first screenings of the Lumi&egrave;re
program, the writer H. G. Wells and his collaborator Robert Paul had plans
to construct a cinematic device for simulating movement through time and
space, a visual attraction on the order of Wells's 1895 science-fiction
novel <I>The Time Machine</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The project failed, but the first decade of the twentieth century saw
 the emergence of an array of widely popular fairground attractions that
 similarly produced an illusion of speed and movement. At the Paris
 Exposition in 1900, an attraction called <I>cin&eacute;orama</I> was
 introduced, simulating the experience of traveling in an aerial balloon
 hovering over Europe and Africa.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The Exposition also included a cinematic attraction called
 <I>mar&eacute;orama</I>, which simulated sea travel--hence the name. The
 trip went from Villefranche to Constantinople via Naples and Venice,
 and came complete with sirens going off and black smoke rising to the
 sky (. <A HREF="8.1danius_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="8.1danius_2.html">2</A>). A guaranteed success, commented <I>Le ro's</I>
 correspondent on 22 July 1900.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few years later an American fairground attraction called Hale's Tours
was invented. A worldwide commercial success, especially between the years
1905 and 1907, it offered a synaesthetic experience of railway travel
through scenic landscapes around the world. Audiences were seated in a
railroad car with an open front, which served as a cinematic frame for
motion pictures that had been shot from the cowcatcher of a train. In
assuming the camera's point of view, spectators felt as though they
themselves were moving through space. The swaying of the railway car,
blowing winds, starts and stops, and the characteristic clickety-clack
sound enhanced the experience of virtual movement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The train and the cinema are two distinct sites of spectatorship, to
be sure, but as Lynne Kirby has argued in her work on early cinema,
they share a fundamental affinity.

 author of the article was Marcel Proust.

Proust had been a regular contributor to <I>Le ro</I> since 1900, and
in "Impressions de route en automobile" he ventured to capture the optical
thrills he had experienced in Normandy with Agostinelli behind the wheel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 A stylistic exercise in modernist techniques of visual mimesis, the 1907
 article addresses a representational problem: how to render the lived
 experience of speed and movement. The piece relates how the narrator and
 his driver travel along a winding road in Normandy, going from a place
 near Caen to a small town halfway between Lisieux and Louviers. The
 purpose of their trip is to pay a visit to the narrator's parents. The
 purpose of the article, however, is to depict how the motorcar catapults
 through space and how speed transforms the surrounding landscape into a
 phantasmagoria. These descriptions are then flanked by dense digressions
 on architecture, religious art, and the history of travel. Both Ruskin
 and Turner are mentioned, as are seventeenth-century Dutch painters
 such as Philips Wouwermans and Adriaen van de Velde. Proust thus makes
 sure to anchor his speed-infused landscape in the esteemed traditions
 of art history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No wonder, then, that Proust so often resorts to a vocabulary that
revolves around the visual. At the outset, Proust sets the stage for the
optical adventures that will follow by pointing out that the windshields
convert the vista into an aesthetic object: "To my right, to my left,
in front of me, the car windows--which I kept closed--put behind glass,
so to speak, the beautiful September day which, even in the open air, one
could only see as through a kind of transparence" ("Jea," 63). Darting
across the plain of Caen at sunset, the motorists experience a visual
event whose delightful nature is a function of the speed. As we shall
see, the windshields delimit the view of the landscape, converting it
into an object of visual pleasure--a mobile panorama. In other words,
the motorcar has become a vehicle of perception, paving the way for new
forms of aesthetic gratification.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, it is as though the motorcar is at a standstill while the
environment rushes towards it. No sooner has the vehicle gathered momentum
than the motorists come to witness how ancient buildings spring to life:
"old lopsided houses ran nimbly toward us, offering us fresh roses or
proudly showing us the young hollyhock they had grown and which already
had outgrown them" ("Jea," 63). The inanimate becomes

<B></B>

animate; the immobile becomes mobile. Similarly, when the motorcar
arrives at the foot of the cathedral in Caen, Proust writes not that
the automobile speeds toward it; instead, it is the steeples that throw
themselves at the vehicle, and with such violence that the driver almost
collides with the porch. In reversing mobility and immobility, Proust,
like Maeterlinck before him, seeks a rhetoric of speed capable of evoking
the velocity with which the motorcar traverses the plain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 At the same time, Proust insists on what the motorist perceives and not
 on what he knows. This stylistic technique animates the central panel of
 the article, the artful representation of the steeples rising above Caen:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The minutes passed, we were traveling fast, and yet the three steeples
were always ahead of us, like birds perched upon the plain, motionless and
conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the horizon was torn open like a fog
unveiling completely and in detail a form invisible an instant before,
and the towers of the Trinity appeared, or rather what appeared was one
single tower perfectly hiding the other. But it drew aside, the other
stepped forward and both of them lined up. Finally, a dilatory steeple
. . . had come to join them, springing into position in front of them with
a bold leap. Now, between the propagating steeples below which one saw
the light which at this distance seemed to smile, the town, following
their momentum from below without being able to reach their heights,
developed steadily by vertical rises the complicated but candid fugue
of its rooftops.

The motorized spectator surely knows what the sun-drenched phenomena on
the horizon represent, but he presents them as synechdoches, as part
of a not-yet-revealed whole--as steeples, not churches. The steeples
are a sensuous sign, an enigmatic piece of writing whose meaning awaits
decipherment. In this sense, too, the narrator insists on what his eyes
perceive and not on what he knows, all in an effort to render the lived
experience of speed and the delicious perception of the landscape through
which the car races:

We had long since left Caen, and . . . the two steeples of Saint-Etienne
and that of Saint-Pierre waved once again their sun-bathed pinnacles in
token of farewell. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two
might watch us for a moment still; soon I saw only two. Then they veered
one last time like two golden pivots, and vanished from my sight. Many
times afterwards, when traveling across the plain of Caen at sunset,
I would see them again, sometimes at a great distance, and seeming no
more now than two flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of
the fields; sometimes from a little closer, the steeple of Saint-Pierre
having already caught up with them, they seemed like three maidens in a
legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall;
and as I drew away from them, I could see them timidly seeking their way,
and after some awkward attempts and stumbling movements of their noble
silhouettes, drawing close to one another, gliding one behind another,
forming now against the still rosy sky no more than a single dusky shape,
pleasant and resigned, and so vanishing in the night. ["Jea," 65]

"The psychology of motoring has found its true writer in
Proust," Ernst Robert Curtius notes in his classic study of
<I>Remembrance</I>. Reflecting on the close link between

<B></B>

the narrator's epiphanic moments of inspiration and his speedy movement
through space, in "Impressions de route en automobile" as well as in
<I>Remembrance</I>, Curtius aptly remarks that one cannot imagine Proust
on foot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Indeed, in Proust speed bursts open a new universe. As the immobile
 is set in motion, the artistic eye takes possession of the newly
 transformed visual world, as the following passage drawn from <I>Cities
 of the Plain</I> suggests: "Coming to the foot of the cliff road, the
 car climbed effortlessly, with a continuous sound like that of a knife
 being ground, while the sea, falling away, widened beneath us. The old
 rustic houses of Montsurvent came rushing towards us, clasping to their
 bosoms vine or rose-bush; the firs of la Raspeli&egrave;re . . . ran
 in every direction to escape from us" (<I>RTP</I>, 2:1029-30/3:386).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The proper content of the passage is the excitement of speed, the
throbbing thrill of the new and the estrangement of the familiar. And
if the scenario appears before the reader as though newly caught, it
is because Proust insists on the Ruskinian belief in the primacy of the
perceived. He does so particularly on the syntactic level. Not only is
the motorcar turned into a subject; the vehicle is soon accompanied by
other inanimate objects that also quicken, spring to life, and acquire
syntactical agency: the sea <I>pulls back</I> behind the automobile, the
houses <I>rush</I> toward the motorists, the firs <I>leap</I> to the side
like anxious pedestrians. Here as in "Impressions de route en automobile,"
then, Proust deploys the re of inversion, and the qualities normally
attributed to automobiles--force, speed, mobility--attach themselves to
the immobile environment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 What is more, the passage shows Proust at his most modernistic, for
 at the center stands not a human subject but a motorcar, hailed by
 the futurists as the true incarnation of beauty, second only to the
 aeroplane. Proust makes use of a similar reversal technique when, in
 <I>The Fugitive</I>, he describes how the narrator undertakes a gondola
 trip in Venice. At first the emphasis is placed on the craft and how
 it moves through the neighborhoods, and then the city itself springs
 to life. Like the fantastic steeples rising above Caen, the Venetian
 canals and fa&ccedil;ades turn into a mobile panorama:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

My gondola followed the course of the small canals; like the mysterious
hand of a genie leading me through the maze of this oriental city, they
seemed, as I advanced, to be cutting a path for me through the heart of a
crowded quarter which they bisected, barely parting, with a slender furrow
arbitrarily traced, the tall houses with their tiny Moorish windows;
and as though the magic guide had been holding a candle in his hand and
were lighting the way for me, they kept casting ahead of them a ray of
sunlight for which they cleared a route. [<I>RTP</I>, 3:641/4:206]

Like Maeterlinck and Mirbeau, Proust embraces speed and movement with
striking enthusiasm, seeking to capture the mobile panorama before the
motorists' eyes. Yet although such episodes show Proust at his most
modernistic, perhaps at his most innovative, his stylistic techniques
are not without precedent. As I have suggested, the Proustian mode of
rendering speed and movement is closely related to representational
techniques inherent in early cinematography and turn-of-the-century
fairground attractions.

 In these inspired pages, however, he drops the narrative about the

 mighty vision of the mobile steeples. It is as though the original
 building plan is no longer needed, thrown away now that the edifice has
 been erected. But if the tableau has been stripped of the narrative
 in which it was first embedded, it is also because Proust places the
 picturesque panorama within another story, one which revolves around
 the young narrator's fear that he might never become a writer.

One evening the young hero travels along the Guermantes way in

the doctor, and begins to write. It is his first piece of writing. The
emergence of writing, then, is intimately linked to technologies of
velocity and the new spaces of representation they open up.

Later, looking back at the event, the older narrator details the optical
scenario, how the road bends, how the twin steeples appear to change
position, now here, now there, and how, suddenly, they are joined by
a third sunlit steeple. Remarkably, he then proceeds to duplicate the
description of the vertiginous ride and the enchanted steeples. Halting
the diegetic flow, he presents the episode to the reader again--in the
form of the literary fragment drafted on the coach-box. It is the one
and only time that the narrator quotes himself, and the repetition,
of course, underscores the singular importance of the sequence.

Apart from having been adapted to the Combray topography, and apart from
a few cuts and minor modifications, the fragment is a word-for-word
replica of the centerpiece of the article on the visual pleasures of
motoring written in 1907.

 The only difference is that Proust has substituted an old-fashioned
 carriage for the original automobile. There is an obvious reason. The
 Martinville episode takes place in the early 1880s, well before the
 advent of the automobile. Now, presumably the narrator has traveled
 in a carriage many times, so how can it be that he experiences such
 perceptual freshness? As Bernard Guyon has suggested, this is why Proust
 underscores the speedy gallop and Dr. Percepied's exceptional haste.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Hence the dewiness of the narrator's visual experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Martinville episode rounds off <I>Combray</I>, the overture to
<I>Remembrance</I>. But there is more to the episode, for it is to
reappear as a leitmotif within Proust's narrative as a whole, as part of
the overarching theme which revolves around the narrator's distress that
he will fail to become what he so desperately wants to be: a writer. If
one pulls the thread that Proust lays out in <I>Swann's Way</I> and
that runs through the novel up until the penultimate volume, one will
discover some of the stitches that hold the

<B></B>

unwieldy tale together. In <I>The Guermantes Way</I>, the narrator
mentions in passing that he has found the piece about the Martinville
steeples that he wrote on the coach-box of Dr. Percepied's carriage and
that he has submitted a slightly edited version to <I>Le ro</I>
(<I>RTP</I>, 2:412/2:691-692). It seems to have been in vain,
however, for the article fails to appear. In <I>The Captive</I>, the
narrator opens <I>Le ro</I> once again in the hope of discovering
his article in print (<I>RTP</I>, 3:4-5/3:523). A little later,
he repeats the attempt, with the same disappointing result (<I>RTP</I>,
3:114/3:626). It is only in <I>The Fugitive,</I> the next to last volume,
that the plot about the unprinted article reaches its climax and the
piece finally appears in the pages of the Parisian paper. The narrator
swells with pride. He is so taken with the dignity of the event that
he begins to sing the praises of the word, the mass produced word:
"I considered the spiritual bread of life that a newspaper is, still
warm and damp from the press in the murky air of the morning in which
it is distributed, at daybreak, to the housemaids who bring it to their
masters with their morning coffee, a miraculous, self-multiplying bread
which is at the same time one and ten thousand, which remains the same
for each person while penetrating innumerably into every house at once"
(<I>RTP</I>, 3:579/4:148).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The daily paper is to the soul what bread is to the stomach. In Proust's
hands, the newspaper--this profane piece of printed matter that, at best,
enjoys a twenty-four-hour life span before it is degraded into wrapping
paper--acquires almost religious dimensions. The passage alludes to the
episode in the New Testament where Jesus miraculously produces bread to
the hungry masses gathered to listen to his sermon. Rarely has a daily
paper been described in loftier terms. And this in a work of literature
that so emphatically celebrates the <I>book</I>--and certainly not as a
mass product but, as Victor Graham has stressed, as a spiritual entity,
as a soul that happens to reside in a body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The leitmotif weaves its way through a few more pages. When the
narrator runs into monsieur de Guermantes, it turns out that the duke
has failed to notice the article. The next time they meet, however,
the duke congratulates him on a splendid piece of writing and on having
found himself an activity worthy of esteem, but he laments the somewhat
precious and clich&eacute;d style that, to his mind, characterizes large
parts of the text. Tough criticism, to be sure, but what is essential
is that the narrator has won recognition as a writer. In this way,
then, the thematic thread binds together a course of events that begins
with the Martinville episode, when the narrator produces his very first
piece of writing, and that ends when <I>Le ro</I> finally runs the
article and he makes his long-desired debut. Only one thing remains:
for the narrator to write a significant work of literature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When <I>Remembrance</I> was in its beginning stages, Proust played
with the idea of letting the novel open with the episode where the
narrator sees his first publication in print. In these early sketches,
Proust's hero turns around in his bed, just as in the final version. The
difference is that he is anxiously contemplating the fate of the article
he has long since submitted to <I>Le ro</I>. The next day his proud
mother, trying in vain to appear casual and indifferent, enters his
bedroom with a copy of <I>Le ro</I> featuring his article on the
front page. Although Proust was to move the <I>ro</I> episode from the

<B></B>

opening pages of <I>Swann's Way</I> to <I>The Fugitive</I>, the fact that
he originally thought of linking the crucial bedtime episode that opens
the novel to the <I>ro</I> episode affirms the latter's importance
(<I>RTP</I>, 1:633-36, 639).

At the time of "Impressions de route en automobile," as I have suggested,
we find Proust traveling again in Ruskin's footsteps, more than a year
after his <I>p&eacute;riode ruskinienne</I> is commonly believed to
have ended.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 To prepare himself for these excursions, he asked his friend and
 ex-partner Reynaldo Hahn to send him a number of Ruskin volumes
 (<I>C</I>, 7:269-1). It should not come as a surprise, then,
 that the piece of prose fiction which resulted from these trips
 treats a number of typically Ruskinian themes: landscape, travel,
 architecture, painting, seeing; in addition, Ruskin is mentioned twice
 and quoted once. And it is certainly true that Ruskin's spirit pervades
 "Impressions de route en automobile," at least as long as the car is
 kept out of the picture. But the car, of course, is the motor of the
 scenario. It is both part of the spectacle and its very vehicle. Take
 away the car and the speed-infused panorama loses its charge, for
 it is the not-yet-domesticated experience of velocity that, along
 with the window frames, give rise to the visual marvels that Proust
 so painstakingly describes. Thanks to modern technologies of speed,
 a new space of representation has opened up and made itself available
 to aesthetic exploration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The British painter and Royal Academician Hubert von Herkomer once
explained the appeal of the automobile: "The pleasure [of motoring] is
seeing Nature as I could in no other way see it; my car having 'tops,'
I get Nature framed--and picture after the other delights my artistic
eye," he wrote in 1905.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 As Herkomer gazed through the windshield, the view transformed itself
 to a series of tableaux complete with frames. The automobile had become
 a viewing instrument on the order of, say, the Claude glass.

It is hard to think of a more congenial representation of this idea than
Henri Matisse's <I>Le Pare-brise: Sur la route de Villacoublay</I> (<I>The
Windshield</I>). Conceived during a long motoring trip in southern France
in 1916, Matisse's painting takes as its subject a windshield, including
the view of the road and the surrounding landscape as seen through the
windows (<A HREF="8.1danius_3.html"> 3</A>). A study in perspective, the painting foregrounds the
way in which the view is framed, exploring how the three windows delimit
the spectator's field of vision and divide the seen into separate yet
related visual spaces. These spaces, in their turn, transform themselves
into a pictorial suite, into three distinct images--it is as though they
were only waiting to be lifted into the artist's sketchbook. And this
is indeed what is taking place in Matisse's painting. In the right-hand
corner, we glimpse a sketchbook propped up against the steering wheel. The
frame of the sketch under way corresponds to the window frame in the front
which, in its turn, corresponds to the frame of the canvas itself. Such
a complicated play of frames underscores that the painting is more than
a mere representation of the road from Villacoublay; it also

<B></B>

records its own coming into being. Indeed, <I>Le Pare-brise</I> is a
meta-painting. Ultimately, it turns the automobile into a metaphor for
the painter's eye.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"When one crosses a landscape by automobile or express train, it becomes
fragmented; it loses in descriptive value but gains in synthetic value,"
Fernand L&eacute;ger wrote in 1914. Contemplating the affinity between
modern technologies of speed and the emergence of new ways of seeing,
he suggested that the "view through the door of the railroad car or the
automobile windshield, in combination with the speed, has altered the
habitual look of things."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Proust's mode of describing the automobile ride, the excitement of
 speed, and the dazzling views through the windshields is a brilliant
 example of precisely the kind of modernist aesthetic that L&eacute;ger
 promotes in his essay, written half a dozen years after Proust's piece
 was first published. In embracing the modern and making it a vital
 part of his visual aesthetics, Proust effectively negates Ruskin's
 anti-modern spirit. What is most striking, of course, is the fact that
 Proust places an automobile at the center of the spectacle he seeks to
 represent. But there are other features, in "Impressions de route en
 automobile" as well as elsewhere, that bespeak the subtle ways in which
 Proust can be said to invert, even make fun of, Ruskin's anti-modern
 stance. When, for example, the motorists are forced to stop in Lisieux
 because of a mechanical problem, the narrator takes a moment to study
 the fa&ccedil;ade of the cathedral because, as he points out to the
 reader, Ruskin once wrote about it. Night has fallen, however, and
 Lisieux is pitch-black. Agostinelli therefore turns on the headlights
 and directs them at the cathedral's exterior, endowing the porch with
 a halo of electric lighting. Needless to say, nothing could be farther
 from Ruskin's ideal lighting conditions.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a 1909 pastiche, Proust continues his gentle mockery of Ruskin's
programmatic critique of all things mechanical, imagining that the
British critic has penned a description of Paris as seen from an
aeroplane, a piece that, as Proust writes in a humorous subclause,
"is rightly known as one of the master's most refined pieces."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Parodying Ruskin's style, Proust describes sight, sites, and atmospheres
 using the expansive and sumptuous idiom so characteristic of Ruskin's
 works. These poetic impressions, however, are not generated by the art
 critic's pre-technological eye. Indeed, this is not a Ruskin who takes
 slow walks through the countryside but one who darts across the skies
 in a vision machine, reveling in the joy of looking down on the domes
 of Sacre- Coeur. And when the mechanical bird finally descends, the
 creative gaze of the air-borne spectator perceives not the Eiffel Tower
 but the spear of Odin. In Proust's pastiche, then, air travel promotes
 precisely the kind of fresh sensory experience that Ruskin honored.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Distant echoes of the aeroplane motif can be heard in <I>The Fugitive</I>,
in the episode where the narrator pays a visit to the Arena chapel
in Padua. Gazing in amazement at the famous fresco cycle on which
Ruskin dwells in <I>Giotto and His Works in Padua</I>, he is struck
not by the artist's treatment of the Annunciation, the Nativity, the
Crucifixion, and the other Biblical events that make up the glorious life
of Christ. Instead, what catches the narrator's eye are Giotto's angels,
those speedy creatures criss-crossing the heavenly spheres with all the
compelling athleticism otherwise associated with early-twentieth-century
aviation shows:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Constantly flitting about above the saints whenever the latter walk
abroad, these little beings, since they are real creatures with
a genuine power of flight, can be seen soaring upwards, describing
curves, "looping the loop" [in French: "d&eacute;crivant des courbes,
mettant la plus grande aisance &agrave; ex&eacute;cuter des loopings"],
diving earthwards head first, with the aid of wings which enable them
to support themselves in positions that defy the laws of gravity, and
are far more reminiscent of an extinct species of bird, or of young
pupils of Garros practising gliding, than of angels of the Renaissance
and later periods whose wings have become no more than emblems and whose
deportment is generally the same as that of heavenly beings who are not
winged. [<I>RTP</I>, 3:663/4:227]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Without further ado, Giotto's able-bodied angels are here turned into
aeroplanes engaged in a sophisticated air show &agrave; la Roland
Garros. According to Paul Robert's dictionary, this is the first time
that the word <I>looping</I>, in the sense of "looping the loop,"
appears in French.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Ruskin surely would have turned over in his grave at the thought of
 Giotto's heavenly hosts being likened to aeroplanes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Yet, in insisting on the aerotechnical gusto with which they race across
 the sky, Proust pays tribute to Giotto, to all the tangible plasticity
 and muscular vigor that characterize his treatment of the angels. As
 opposed to their ethereal Renaissance colleagues, Giotto's creatures
 have been furnished with real wings and can actually fly. A greeting
 from one artist to another, the episode celebrates the flesh-and-blood
 naturalism that has ensured Giotto such a prominent place in the annals
 of art history. Not only does Proust cancel Ruskin's anti-modern stance;
 he also works out a vital element of his own aesthetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I have discussed the great extent to which Proust takes
delight in speed and movement, in "Impressions de route en automobile"
as well as in numerous episodes in <I>Remembrance.</I> I have shown how
Proust engages the universe of modernity, flung open by technologies
of velocity, such as the motorcar, and articulated by technologies
of vision, such as cinematography. Beyond this conclusion, however,
there is another and more important one, for the point is that Proust,
precisely by overturning Ruskin's hostile attitude toward the increasing
industrialization of time and space, was able to pay tribute to his old
mentor's aesthetic imperative: to keep to what one sees and not to what
one knows is there.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At one extreme, Proust's novel is given over to a contemplative inquiry
into times lost, exploring the decisive role of the five senses in
the search of the past. At the other extreme, the novel is fuelled by a
passion for the present, a restless, voracious, and transformative passion
that revolves not around memory but around sense perception. If Ruskin
helped give birth to the author of <I>Remembrance of Things Past</I>,
it was to a forward-looking and future-oriented writer with a hearty
appetite for the modern world of technology and the new ways of seeing
it affords. Proust knew how to capture this universe at precisely that
short-lived moment when the distant past rubs against the absolutely new,
when the world suddenly and unexpectedly appears as a swarm of hieroglyphs
crying for decipherment.

Proust reprinted "Impressions de route en automobile" under the title
"Journ&eacute;es en automobile," a name which served as the subtitle
to an essay more commonly known as "Les &eacute;glises sauv&eacute;es:
les cloches de Caen: la cath&eacute;drale de Lisieux," in <I>Pastiches et
m&eacute;langes</I> (Paris: Gallimard, 1919) and added two footnotes. In
one of these footnotes he explains that he chose to recycle parts of the
<I>ro</I> article in <I>A la recherche du temps perdu</I>; he also
points out that in a not-yet-published volume of <I>A la recherche</I>,
the publication of the "fragment" about the steeples in <I>Le ro</I>
would be the subject of almost an entire chapter. My citations

It may well be that Proust, in writing "Impressions de route en
automobile," sought to surpass Maeterlinck's "En automobile." Both stories
are set in the countryside in Normandy; both stress that the motor car
enables modern humans to experience as many landscapes and spectacles in
a day as would formerly have demanded a whole life-time; both attempt
to represent the visual impressions along the road. A great admirer of
Maeterlinck's work, Proust repeatedly returned to the celebrated writer
and playwright in his literary texts and especially in his letters. He is
likely to have read Maeterlinck's "En automobile." The story was published
in <I>Le Double jardin</I>, which came out in 1904, and Proust refers
to the volume that same year. Furthermore, as Philip Kolb has noted, in
the so-called <I>Carnet de 1908</I>, a notebook containing notes towards
<I>Contre Sainte-Beuve</I>, Proust alludes to Maeterlinck's motoring
piece: "Odeur des automobiles en campagne. Maeterlinck a tort" (Proust,
<I>Carnet de 1908</I>, ed. Philip Kolb, Cahiers Marcel Proust, no. 8
[Paris: Gallimard, 1976], 70). Kolb notes, too, that Proust also alludes
to the piece when, in <I>The Captive,</I> the smell of petrol reminds the



narrator of his automobile excursions with Albertine. In addition, Proust
produced a pastiche of Maeterlinck's style; at the end, he touches upon
the automobile theme and the excitement of speed ("L'Affaire Lemoine par
Maeterlinck," in <I>Contre Sainte-Beuve</I>, 197-201). If Proust
indeed sought to outdo Maeterlinck's motoring piece, it is an impulse
that befits what the Martinville episode signifies: the birth of a writer,
untouched by the anxiety of influence.

In a brief article on Proust's cinematic style, Jacques Nantet suggests
that the narrator's car ride as well as the Martinville episode
demonstrate how the "lens moves with the narrative"; see Nantet,
"Marcel Proust et la vision cin&eacute;matographique," <I>Revue
des lettres modernes</I> 5.36-38 : 307-12. Renate
H&ouml;risch-Helligrath has similarly proposed that Proust's rendering
of the car ride is analogous to techniques of cinematic production,
although in her essay, too, the suggestion remains undeveloped; see
H&ouml;risch-Helligrath, "Das deutende Auge: Technischer Fortschritt
und Wahrnehmungsweise in der <I>Recherche</I>," in <I>Marcel Proust:
Motiv und Verfahren</I>, ed. Edgar Mass, Publikationen der Marcel Proust
Gesellschaft, vol. 4 (Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1986), 22.

That Proust developed what may be conceived of as literary counterparts of
cinematographic techniques, especially montage and close-up techniques,
was noted by several early reviewers. In Proust scholarship, however,
the resonance between Proust's style and cinema has been largely
unexplored. As early as 1914 the French writer and painter Jacques-Emile
Blanche, in a review of <I>Swann</I>, remarked that "Proust has not so
much been keeping a journal as amusing himself with a kind of cinema film,
reconstituting the sequences and <I>posing</I> in it himself for several
characters, throwing, as the whim takes him, the cloak of one around
the shoulders of another, or even wearing it himself" (<I>Marcel Proust:
The Critical Heritage</I>, ed. Leighton Hodson [London: Routledge, 1989],
116). Another critic, reviewing <I>La Prisonni&egrave;re</I> for <I>The
Times</I> in 1924, also underscores the cinematic parallel: "No other
author that I have ever read comes near Proust in the photographic,
or rather kinematographic delineation of a big social 'crush,' with its
tittle-tattle and back-biting, the snobbery and insolent condescension
of its 'great ladies,' its occasional epigrams, its bowing and scraping
<I>super ignes suppositos</I>, its stifling and noxious atmosphere, its
glimpses of queer episodes behind <I>porti&egrave;res</I> and in remote
corridors" (<I>Marcel Proust: The Critical Heritage</I>, 269). Benjamin
Cr&eacute;mieux, finally, remarked that: "Proust has been described as
depicting life in <I>slow motion</I> and this formula has had a certain
success. For all that, it is wrong; it is other novelists who depict
life <I>speeded up</I>" (<I>Marcel Proust: The Critical Heritage</I>,
289-90). For a more substantial attempt to analyze cinematic modes
of representation in Proust, particularly so-called travelings and
close-ups, see Jacques Bourgeois, "Le cin&eacute;ma &agrave; la recherche
du temps perdu," <I>Revue du cin&eacute;ma</I> 1.3 (December 1946):
18-38. Remarkably, Bourgeois goes so far as to argue that Proust
anticipates a more "mature" form of narrative cinema--mature because
psychologically inflected.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT38" HREF="#REF38">38</A>.
Jeffrey T. Schnapp has similarly observed that the reversal re--the
substitution of immobility for mobility, and vice versa--organizes a great
deal of representations of speed and motion in the modernist period. It
recurs, he writes, "in nearly every early description of accelerated
motion and underlies the design of thrill rides in nineteenth-century
amusement parks as well as their cinematic shows: namely, <I>a reversal
of perspective such that it now appears as if it is the landscape that
is in motion and not the traveler; or, rather, that the landscape is
in motion for the traveler</I>." See Jeffrey Schnapp, "Crash (Speed as
Engine of Individuation),"  6.1 (Jan. 1999): 22
(emphasis in the original). Interestingly enough, Schnapp argues that the
re can be traced back as far as to eighteenth-century descriptions
of mail-coach travel. My approach differs from his in the sense that
I am concerned with the ways in which vehicles in motion--trains as
well as automobiles--may serve as visual framing devices and how they,
therefore, share an affinity with cinema. Also, I focus on early cinema
and turn-of-the-century fairground attractions as <I>simulacra</I> of
speed, that is, as <I>means of representation</I>. Combined, these two
aspects constitute what I take to be a specifically late nineteenth-
and early-twentieth-century phenomenon.

Most commentators have read the Martinville episode in the interpretive
terms proposed by the novel itself, concentrating on the question of
literary creation and the mysteries of perspective,



sometimes even extending the reading into mystical or religious
terms. Poulet's formal analysis deviates from this pattern. Arguing
that in Proust travel is even more miraculous than involuntary memory,
Poulet suggests that the travel motif is a structural pretext for bringing
together unrelated objects in space. Moreover, contrary to memory, the
phenomena that travel conjoins do not depend upon resemblances (Poulet,
<I>L'espace proustien</I> [Paris: Gallimard, 1963], 91-105). In
Deleuze's view, the Martinville episode fuels what he perceives as
the novel's global theme: the hero's apprenticeship in the art of
reading signs (Deleuze, <I>Proust et les signes</I>, 2nd ed. [Paris:
Presses Universitaires de France, 1970], 7-9). For Jean-Pierre
Richard, the Martinville steeples are a typically Proustian hermeneutic
object, but also an allegory to be unpacked along psychoanalytic lines
(Richard, <I>Proust et le monde sensible</I> [Paris: Seuil, 1974],
155-67). According to Diane Leonard, the Martinville episode
testifies to Proust's modernism, because it introduces perspectival
illusions and the question of depth into Proust's novel (Leonard,
"Proust and Virginia Woolf, Ruskin and Roger Fry: Modernist Visual
Dynamics," <I>Comparative Literature Studies</I> 18.3 (September 1981):
333-43). Linda A. Gordon claims that the episode is "a model of
the perspectival relationships between subject and object" (Gordon, "The
Martinville Steeplechase: Charting the Course," <I>Style</I> 22.3 (Fall
1988): 402-9). For Howard Moss, the steeples are premonitions,
as they embody a slice of Marcel's hidden future: the writerly
future. See Howard Moss, <I>The Magic Lantern of Marcel Proust</I>
(New York: Macmillan, 1962), 87-103. For a stylistic commentary,
see Luzius Keller, <I>Proust Lesen</I> (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp,
1991), 229-38.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Keith Cohen has similarly underscored the importance of the episode:
"Marcel's experience of seeing the Martinville and Vieuxvicq steeples
from a moving coach makes an indelible mark on the text, since it gives
rise to the first piece of writing <I>within</I> the text attributed to
Marcel himself" (Cohen, <I>Film and Fiction: The Dynamics of Exchange</I>
(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), 160).

Although the Martinville episode is widely thought of as pivotal
episode in Proust's novel, most critics have neglected the fact that
it derives from an earlier text. Curtius's Proust study offers an
exception, as do Bernard Guyon's and Wolfram Nitsch's articles. Guyon
provides a close reading of the Martinville episode, arguing that the
episode is a "poetical transposition" of the corresponding piece in
<I>Le ro</I>. He also maintains that the novel's genesis must be
sought in "Impressions de route en automobile" which, on his view,
testifies to Proust's greatness as a writer; see Guyon, "Marcel
Proust et le myst&egrave;re de la cr&eacute;ation litt&eacute;raire:
Essai d'explication des 'Clochers de Martinville,'" <I>Annales de
la Facult&eacute; des lettres de Toulouse</I>, no. 1-2 :
37-65. Nitsch discusses the genesis of the automobile motif in Proust
at large, his principal aim being to study how Proust's attitude towards
the motif changes over the years. He concentrates on the <I>ro</I>
article, usefully connecting the visual enigmas triggered by the car ride
to Elstir's painterly aesthetic; see Nitsch, "Phantasmen aus Benzin:
Prousts Automobile in textgeschichtlicher Sicht," in <I>Marcel Proust:
Schreiben ohne Ende</I>, ed. Rainer Warning (Frankfurt am Main: Insel,
1994), 93-108. Carter has also noted the connections between the
<I>ro</I> article and the Martinville episode, although he stops short
of textual analysis; see Carter, <I>Proustian Quest</I>, 135-37.

See Victor Graham, <I>The Imagery of Proust</I> (Oxford: Basil Blackwell,
1966), 33. Consider, for example, the episode about the death of the
writer Bergotte in <I>The Captive</I>, where Proust accomplishes one of
his most moving and pregnant images: "They buried him, but all through
that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged
three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed,
for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection" (<I>RTP</I>,

As Proust's 1907 correspondence shows, he spent August and part of
September in Cabourg, and went on trips "en automobile ferm&eacute;e"
to architecturally significant sites in Normandy. Judging from the
letters, "Impressions de route en automobile" appears to have received
an enthusiastic response from his friends. See, for example, Proust's
letter to Mme. Straus (<I>C</I>, 7:315-6), in which Proust also
refers to Agostinelli's admiring letter; and Daniel Hal&eacute;vy's
letter to Proust which, as Philip Kolb has suggested, was part of an
exchange apropos of the motoring article ( <I>C</I>, 7:320-2).

Things are more complicated, however, for it is clear that Ruskin's
brilliant reading of Giotto's treatment of the angels paved the
way for Proust's aerotechnical imagery. In fact, although Ruskin is
never mentioned by name in the Padua episode, some of Proust's boldest
reflections are indebted to Ruskin: "There is noticeable here," Ruskin
writes in <I>Giotto and His Works in Padua</I>, "as in all works of
this early time, a certain confidence in the way in which the angels
trust to their wings, very characteristic of a period of bold and
simple conception. Modern science has taught us that a wing cannot be
anatomically joined to a shoulder; and in proportion as painters approach
more and more to the scientific, as distinguished from the contemplative
state of mind, they put the wings of their angels on more timidly, and
dwell with greater emphasis upon the human form, and with less upon the
wings, until these last become a species of decorative appendage,--a mere
<I>sign</I> of an angel. But in Giotto's time an angel was a complete
creature, as much believed in as a bird; and the way in which it would
or might cast itself into the air, and lean hither and thither upon its
plumes, was as naturally apprehended as the manner of flight of a chough
or a starling" (<I>WJR</I>, 24:72; emphasis in the original).

I am not able to share your opinion that the new course in Germany might
be only a nightmare lasting a few months. I am filled with the deepest
pessimism because I believe that only now will we pay the price for
underestimating the opponent, that only now will we see that they will
maintain a better, firmer, and more ruthless hold on everything than
the republicans ever dared to do during 15 years. . . . I believe that
we should be prepared for anything and then let destiny take its course.

All good music since 1850, T. W. Adorno repeatedly asserted, has renounced
commercialism altogether. Extrapolating from Arnold Schoenberg's 1927
dictum that "in the end, art and success have to part company," Adorno
succinctly articulated an aesthetic axiom central to modernist ideology:
worthwhile art music either floats, unsullied in its autonomy, above
economics, politics, and commerce or critically resists its origins and
contexts by its very existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 While popular musics are necessarily



conditioned by the marketplace and are always, as merchandise, subject
to the imperatives of commerce, "good music" exists in a pure state as
"art for art's sake." Because it formulates and then obeys its own laws,
this music transcends its contexts and "represents a triumph over the
world and not a mere reflection of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Adhering to this axiom, most historical accounts of music in the
 twentieth century to date have privileged musical composition over
 other musical activities, including performance, publication, and
 reception. For example, such bias, unacknowledged and unstated in Arnold
 Whittall's <I>Music Since the First World War</I>, is manifest in the
 title of the revised and expanded imprint of 1999, <I>Musical Composition
 in the Twentieth Century</I>. In his "Millennial Prelude" to the volume,
 Whittall reaffirms his approach while making a perfunctory disclaimer:
 "Even if much of my own text may appear to subscribe to the outmoded
 heresy of autonomy, treating its chosen compositions in isolation from
 any contexts other than the particular technical features selected
 by the author, some hint of the world outside the work will break
 in from time to time. . . . It will, I hope, be obvious that a text
 conceived in the way I have described cannot be regarded as a history
 of twentieth-century music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cultural practice of publishing new music in the twentieth
century, in particular, has received scant scholarly attention. In
fact, the reproduction, promotion, dissemination, exploitation, and
protection of modern art music has been studied far less than analogous
publication-related activities in the eras of Monteverdi and Mozart.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Yet, what is at stake in charting the course of music publication in the
 twentieth century is not just a more complete empirical description of
 musical commerce, as important as that might be, but rather a basis for
 reconsidering the continuities and discontinuities in the historical
 arc extending from the heady pre-War days of Weimar experimentation,
 through National Socialist political appropriation of music as the
 "most German of the arts," to the post-War "tyranny" of Darmstadt
 serialism. Now that the "modernist project" is being subjected to closer
 scrutiny, it is becoming clear that the process of composing music
 and getting it performed (the good, bad, and ugly alike) was usually
 conditioned as much by practical and financial considerations as it was
 by artistic impulse. During the twentieth century the publication of
 contemporary music has been, in fact, big business. For example, Schott
 Musik International, headquartered in Mainz, reports on its website:
 "With a permanent staff of about 250 employees and 150 free-lancers,
 and offices in Hong Kong, London, Madrid, New York, Paris, Tokyo,
 Toronto and Zurich, Schott Musik International is today one of the
 biggest publishing houses of serious music in the classical tradition."

Music publishing entails large capital investments, big risks, and high
stakes. As protection of intellectual property was gradually expanded
and extended, publishers entrusted with copyrights enjoyed virtual
monopolies over artistic products that substantially outlived their
creators. Even investments in a composer who claimed to be writing for
a time fifty years after his death could be amortized over a period of
protection lasting a century or more, with reasonable expectations of
eventual recoupment or even profit. But speculation in the music market
was no less uncertain a gamble than that in commodities, currencies,
or securities. Care, subsidy, and mentoring of

<B></B>

composers, preparation of performance materials, dissemination
of printed scores, and ongoing promotion, accounting, and
copyright administration were expensive undertakings, with
no guarantees against the vagaries of taste or much direct
influence over the vicissitudes of performing organizations and
institutions. Publishers counted on short-term sensations like
<I>Jonny spielt auf</I> to offset the costs of slow starters
such as <I>Wozzeck</I>. The fruits from the rare everbearers,
such as <I>Carmina Burana</I> (whose earnings consistently exceed
a million dollars annually), and <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> (earning
several hundred thousand dollars annually) subsidized the printing
and warehousing of hundreds of scores and sets of parts that
did little more than gather dust on the shelves. A few such stocks,
including Mahler's symphonies and Schoenberg's <I>Erwartung</I>, turned
out to be "sleepers," lying dormant in the portfolio for decades before
skyrocketing in value and paying off handsomely in the long term.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the most reckless firms hedged their bets with endeavors
less volatile than new music: <I>Urtext</I> editions of "classic"
steady earners, perennially in-demand pedagogical materials, music for
proliferating organizations of amateurs, youths, soldiers, and workers. As
the "democratizing" new media of recordings, radio, and sound films
tantalized with the potential of a mass audience for "serious" music,
upstarts such as Universal Edition (UE) and B&auml;renreiter competed
within a brave new world with such venerable companies as B. Schott's
S&ouml;hne (Schott) and Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel. Germany started
the century as the undisputed center of music publishing (with Leipzig
as its capital). By the end of the Weimar period, Schott and UE had
emerged as the principal rivals for the publication of new music in
Central Europe. As Hans Heinsheimer observed firsthand, "The truly
spectacular battles between the big music publishers, mainly between
the Schotts of Mainz, led by at least one Strecker, and the Universals
of Vienna . . . were fought at the international festivals, the trade
fairs of contemporary music. It was ferocious and merciless warfare,
marvelous to watch and highly enjoyable to participate in. . . . When
they met in hotel lobbies or concerts, they greeted each other with
teeth-grinding exuberance and evil smiles."

Soon, however, genuine international festivals were listed among the
"great sins of the time" that had corrupted "the domain of an art that
until then had been seen throughout the world as the most German of
all." In his speech that opened the "Entartete Musik" Exhibition in
D&uuml;ssseldorf in May 1938, Joseph Goebbels continued: "A certain
period of transition was thus required to remove the errors, failures,
and manifestations of decline through the cultivation of the true artistic
strengths of our German music. . . . The German masters, who with true
artistic command had created immortal works of German tonal art, were
suppressed by the flagrantly commercial elements of international Jewry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The following year, Peter Raabe, then president of the Reichsmusikkammer
 (the Reich Chamber of Music), specifically identified the fate of German
 music with that of German armies: "Not only musicians participated
 in the fate of German music, but all Germans, inasmuch as the people
 of Bach, Beethoven and Bruckner [are] in no other art as superior to
 other peoples as in music. To protect this music against all current
 dangers must be a sacred obligation of all those remaining at home,
 while the army has left to protect [the] country and the

<B></B>

people to which fate has accorded the wonderful and magnificent gift:
German music." A poster captioned "Das Land der Musik" makes explicit
this link between military muscle and the wonderful gift of German
music; it features a gigantic <I>Reichsadler</I> (Eagle of the Reich)
as an acoustic backdrop with organ pipe feathers (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the arts were thus anything but peripheral to the ideology and
propaganda of National Socialism, attempts at regulation and coordination
(<I>Gleichschaltung</I>) of music in general and music publishing in
particular had nevertheless been improvisatory, lethargic, and haphazard
for much of the 1930s. Situated precisely in the bureaucratic cracks
between culture and commerce, where the interests of Goebbel's Ministry
of Propaganda intersected and conflicted with those of the Ministry of
Economics, the six hundred members of the <I>Fachverband</I> (Assembly
for a Specialized Field of Activity) for music publishing comprised by
far the smallest sector of the 95,000-member Reichsmusikkammer, which
required all who participated in the "creation, reproduction,

<B></B>

intellectual or technical processing, dissemination, preservation,
and sale of cultural goods" to join.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Founded on the principle of self-administration under state
 supervision, but hampered by inadequate self-financing from dues,
 the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) initially depended
 on artists and organizations to cooperate voluntarily with the regime
 and to police themselves--even though only 21% of its members would
 eventually join the National Socialist Party.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several of Goebbels's initiatives, including extension of copyright
protection in 1934 from thirty to fifty years post-mortem, directly
benefitted composers and their publishers. Subsequently the
Reichsmusikkammer provided an ongoing subsidy for the purchase of
contemporary music by provincial performing organizations. When the
Propaganda Ministry began to monitor musical performances more closely,
it issued, in September 1935, a list of "musical works allowed under no
circumstances, neither to be publicly performed nor broadcast." However,
there seems to have been no comparable ban on the printing or sale of
this music, other than an initial directive requiring chamber screening
before publication or dissemination of printed music composed by
"persons who have left the German Reich after the seizure of power by
National Socialism" (<I>AIENG</I>, 139). Even after the Nuremburg Laws
forced the purging of 2,202 non-Aryan members of the Reichsmusikkammer
in 1936, exceptions were made in the cases of seventeen non-Aryan music
publishers, including the prominent firms of F&uuml;rstner and Peters,
which remained in Jewish hands for several more years. (This proved so
embarrassing to the Propaganda Ministry that it directed the German
press to avoid calling attention to the situation) (<I>AIENG</I>,
112). Non-Aryan music publishers and music dealers were Aryanized only
gradually in the late 1930s. By then, a Reichsmusikpr&uuml;fstelle
(Reich Music Examining Board) had been established to review all music
planned for German distribution. But the enormity of such a task soon
overwhelmed the staff of four and persuaded Reichsmusikkammer president
Peter Raabe to modify the directive so that music publishers would be
obliged to submit works only on demand of the Pr&uuml;f (AIENG, 141). The
extent of such pre-publication prohibitions is unclear from surviving
records, but the Pr&uuml;fstelle managed to produce only four lists of
"unerw&uuml;nschter musikalischer Werke" ("undesirable musical works"),
remarkable in their brevity and encompassing only 150 compositions and
composers in all. The lists were eclectic, ranging from Irving Berlin
to Egon Wellesz, but with a heavy concentration of American popular music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In retrospect, it seems as if closer regulation of music licensed for
performance by the finite number of German and Austrian music publishers
would have been less cumbersome than monitoring myriad individual
performances throughout the country. However, competing jurisdictions and
power struggles within the Third Reich over responsibility for censorship
and the conduct of business, the potential ramifications of restrictions
on music publishing for international trade and foreign currency reserves,
and the desire to maintain an image of "business as usual" in the "land of
music" shielded the music publishing industry from the harshest scrutiny.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, as in so many other sectors of German society, even
 minimal threats of coercion

<B></B>

by the state had the notable effect of creating an environment of anxiety
in which self-censorship by publishers became the norm. Ultimately
the purge of Jewish composers and publishers radically and permanently
altered the geographical center of gravity within the industry, with
many key res emigrating to England and the United States.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because music publishing had such a low profile within regulatory
agencies, surviving official government documentation of that particular
Fachverband is sparse. Understandably as reluctant as Philip Morris
or Microsoft to open their internal business archives to scholarly
scrutiny because of continuing financial, legal, and contractual
implications, publishing houses have been particularly sensitive about
their history during the twelve-year period of National Socialism. The
largely unreliable self-commissioned "official histories" of individual
publishing companies have tended to treat this period as a brief
aberration of little consequence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 With professional sensitivities compounded by personal ones, family-owned
 firms, of course, have been particularly guarded in this regard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consequently, historians must piece together a fragmentary and
 provisional picture from widely scattered documents extant in other
 repositories, principally correspondence between the publishers and
 their composers.

Two such letters comprise vivid and nearly contemporary post-War snapshots

after 1933 between two leading composers of the Weimar era and their
respective publishers. As portals into the period from very different

Remembering their first meeting during the summer of 1946, Hans Werner
Henze described Willy Strecker as "a witty and affable individual then
in his sixty-third year. . . . A native of Mainz, he had an Argentinian
passport and a house in Wiesbaden, which . . . contained some of the
finest Picassos, Klees, and Braques."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Hindemith had come to Schott more than a quarter century earlier than
 Henze, at almost the same time that Willy Strecker and his older
 brother Ludwig became partners in their father's company, as the
 First World War gave precarious birth to the Weimar Republic. While
 Hindemith's reputation and portfolio grew and Willy Strecker assumed more
 responsibilities within the firm, their professional relationship evolved
 onto a first-name and <I>Du</I>-basis. Schott's strategic stewardship of
 Hindemith's career on a global scale helped him to weather the turbulence
 of "Der Fall Hindemith" in 1934, subsequently to remain viable within
 Germany's musical life (even securing a commission from the Luftwaffe),
 and simultaneously to explore options outside Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 When those efforts finally failed and Hindemith took up residence in
 Switzerland and then the United States, he maintained direct personal
 contact with Schott, except during the years of total war. Continued
 promotion and publication of Hindemith's works abroad by a network of
 partially or wholly owned foreign affiliates minimized the impact of the
 1936 Nazi ban on performance of his works, furnished a firm foundation
 for his move to the United States, and assured his preeminence in
 immediate postwar German musical culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Willy Strecker's son Hugo oversaw from the London office an
orderly transfer of rights, Schott's affiliate in New York, Associated
Music Publishers (AMP), secured conducting and performing engagements
for Hindemith, served as an operational base for his American tours,
and provided ongoing support services during his residency in New Haven.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "The Pub shop in New York," Hindemith wrote Willy Strecker "is a kind
 of substitute for the Weihergarten," the address of Schott's palatial
 headquarters in Mainz. Grateful for such constancy, Hindemith, in turn,
 volunteered that under the circumstances of 1941 his monthly stipend
 should be decreased to only what was necessary to sustain his mother
 and mother-in-law, who had remained behind in Germany. Hindemith wrote
 Strecker:

Having lost direct contact after December 1941, composer and publisher
managed only sporadic communications through intermediaries until August
1945. Emerson Kailey, an American bandsman, for example, visited Strecker
in Mainz in May 1945

<B></B>

and reported back to Hindemith that no manuscripts or plates of his
works had been lost and "they have been publishing everything that came
through from America. The <I>Ludus Tonalis</I> has sold 1,200 copies
in the three months it has been out in Germany." Kailey told Hindemith
that he didn't see Dr. Ludwig Strecker because the brothers "alternate in
going to Mainz. One goes one day and the other the next day. The reason
for that is that they have only one bicycle." The soldier concluded,
"Herr Strecker asked me to tell you that Germany needs you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Strecker's own hand-carried note reported that "the old Weihergarten
 has come through it all more or less intact, [but] the printing works
 are completely destroyed." The relationship between the composer and
 his German publisher had also survived the war more or less intact. It
 remained symbiotic and monogamous; copyrights were systematically
 reassigned to Schott, and works composed in America were soon available
 for sale in Germany. All of Hindemith's music was (and continues to be)
 published exclusively by Schott.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Six weeks after Hindemith had received the encouraging letter from
Strecker of August 1946, Kurt Weill found in his rural mailbox near
New City, New York, a very different sort of letter from Alfred Schlee,
the new <I>de facto</I> Director of UE:

Schlee's letter is the first extant contact between composer and his
Austrian publisher since 1938. Prior to his flight from Berlin in March
1933, Weill had corresponded with UE on almost a daily basis, most
often with Hans Heinsheimer, the head of the stage department. Already
then, the exchange had frequently been plaintive or accusatory rather
than collaborative in tone, especially as the political environment
grew more hostile to performances of Weill's works and the composer's
frustrations with his publisher's efforts intensified. In June 1932,
Heinsheimer attempted to reassure Weill:

<B></B>

"Financial considerations . . . can play a role only to the extent
that we remain aware of the interaction between artistic and financial
concerns. . . . In the case of Kurt Weill, you can continue to be fully
and absolutely assured of our most generous and far-sighted publishing
policies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But Weill had hardly arrived in Paris when UE informed him in April 1933
 that, because the prevailing political situation discouraged performances
 of his stage works in Germany and there was little interest in them
 elsewhere, the firm would have to reduce his contractually mandated
 monthly stipend from 1,000 to 500 marks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 In June UE proposed that the payments be discontinued temporarily or,
 alternatively, their contract be suspended, with rights in Weill's works
 returned to him for a year. When Weill rejected this proposal and UE
 ceased its monthly payments anyway, further acrimonious negotiations
 culminated in back-payment of five months' reduced stipend and mutual
 release from contractual obligations. UE stipulated, however, that it
 reserved the right to recoup the unearned balance in Weill's account
 from a small percentage of future earnings he might receive from
 another publisher.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Their contract would never be reinstated, and none of Weill's subsequent
 compositions would be published by UE.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The arrival of Schlee's letter after almost a decade of silence would
not have surprised Weill as much as its signatory would have. Because
UE's owners and virtually all of the senior staff had followed Weill into
emigration, he would have been unaware that the post-Anschluss leadership
vacuum at UE had been filled internally by Alfred Schlee, whom he would
have remembered only as a minor functionary within the firm. Schlee's
name crops up only a dozen or so times in the nearly 1,400 surviving
letters between Weill and UE written prior to Weill's emigration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prior to joining UE in 1927, Schlee, a native of Dresden, had studied
piano with Erwin Schulhoff and served as chorusmaster in Gera and
dramaturg in M&uuml;nster. Allied with the Wigman school of dance, he
accompanied Wigman's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Yvonne Georgi, and, as a
prolific critic, proselytized for the <I>Ausdruckstanz</I> (expressive
dance) in general and the theories of Rudolf von Laban in particular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Laban's innovations in the notation of dance are better known today than
 his controversial theories of choral dancing, which became the core of
 what was later understood to be a National Socialist aesthetic. Although
 Laban allied himself closely with the National Socialists, he fell out of
 favor in 1938 and emigrated to England. (In dance he is a prime example
 of the fallacy in assuming that "progressive" aesthetics naturally ally
 themselves with "leftist" politics).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In his first contribution to <I>Modern Music</I> in 1931, Schlee
 asserted that art must foster an ethics that would support a strong
 national aesthetic identity: "The German does not consider art as a
 luxury but as an all-important element of his life and culture. And
 he is serious about the responsibility which this conception of art
 entails. It distinguishes him from almost every other race. . . . For
 this reason also the ethical content and not the appeal to the senses
 most concerns the German."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having proposed to UE the founding of a dance periodical, Schlee had
freelanced in 1926 as Paul Stefan's uncredited assistant for <I>Tanz in
dieser Zeit</I>, a special issue of UE's journal, <I>Musikbl&auml;tter
des Anbruch</I>. The following year he officially joined UE's
Propaganda-Abteilung, to assist in the founding of a new quarterly
journal, <I>Schrifttanz</I>,

<B></B>

to be edited by Laban. However, Schlee soon took over sole editorship of
the journal and remained in that capacity until its demise in 1931. That
year he accompanied the tenor Otto Pasetti (who would later sing opposite
Lotte Lenya in the Vienna production of <I>Mahagonny</I> in April 1932)
in a recording on the Paloma label of Weill's "Muschel von Margate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In autumn 1931, UE dispatched Schlee to Berlin, where his two-room
 apartment on Bonner Stra&szlig;e doubled as UE's "Berlin office." Prior
 to 1933, the responsibilities of the "bright-eyed, bushy-tailed Schlee,"
 as Heinsheimer derisively characterized him to Weill, had not extended
 much beyond delivering and retrieving scores and parts from copyists,
 theaters, and composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee's contributions to <I>Modern Music</I> after January 1933, in
contrast to Heinsheimer's courageously outspoken reports, are guarded if
not timid. In 1934, Schlee reported, "The year has been marked by all
the phenomena traditionally associated with periods of great change,
the principal effect having been to restrict the production of new
works and works in new styles. Although <I>Gleichschaltung</I> has been
consummated, different interpretations of it prevail everywhere. A unified
artistic policy cannot yet be guaranteed; it is apparent only in its broad
outlines. . . . The great success [of <I>Arabella</I>]--though the text
is derived from the non-Aryan Hofmannsthal--is chiefly due to the general
worship of the great German personality, Richard Strauss. . . . This last
season has been one of change; the next will determine the fate of opera"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee remained in Berlin until mid-1938, when he returned to Vienna
as one of the very few employees permitted to continue working in the
"nazified" UE. The only hint in the surviving correspondence concerning
an event which might have left the composer "with a very bad impression"
of Schlee is Weill's response to Heinsheimer's report of 28 January 1933:
"Schlee told us very proudly that you couldn't work even with Rene Claire,
because he, too, had capitulated to the film industry." Weill replied on 6
February: "Mr. Schlee's strange remarks are quite misleading." Considering
the enormity of events during the intervening thirteen years, this minor
irritation would seem an unlikely cause for Schlee's post-war concern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee's letter infuriated Weill. Although there is no reply extant in
the UE archives, Weill characterized the circumstances to Georg Kaiser's
widow as an "unbelievable breach of a publisher's responsibility to
its authors." "Unfortunately from here it's very difficult for me
to determine with much clarity the overall publishing situation," he
explained in response to her inquiry about performance possibilities
for the Weill-Kaiser works. "I had a letter from Universal Edition with
the casual notification that all my full scores had been confiscated by
the Gestapo. . . . I don't have a single full score of my European works
and therefore right now I can't say if one can procure them anywhere."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 (According to the terms of its standard agreement with composers,
 holograph scores of works printed by UE became the property of the
 publisher). Weill died without knowing that all but one had, in fact,
 survived. When in the mid-1950s, they emerged quietly and mysteriously,
 not from Gestapo warehouses, but from UE's own wartime caches, Weill's
 widow Lotte Lenya refused to re-assign to UE the twenty-eight-year
 renewal term of U.S. copyright. She placed with Schott several
 unpublished works, including <I>Die sieben Tods&uuml;nden</I>, which
 UE had declined in 1933.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shortly before Weill's death, Schlee demanded that Weill now repay the
outstanding pre-War balance on his account (14,607.05 Austrian schillings)
out of the earnings from <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> or from what Schlee
assumed Weill must have been earning from his Broadway success.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Weill expressed some doubt after the war about UE's right to represent
 any of his works, but neither he nor Lenya followed through with such a
 claim. Eventually UE deducted the balance of the unrecouped advance from
 payments due Weill's estate. As late as 1954, when <I>The Threepenny
 Opera</I> began its recordbreaking run at the Theater de Lys in New
 York, UE's share of royalties (5%) was still impounded by the Custodian
 of Alien Property. UE subsequently allowed many of Weill's works to go
 out of print and published only two full scores of his stage works in
 the fifty years following his death. Today, therefore, Weill's oeuvre
 remains fragmented, individual copyrights literally splintered, with
 half a dozen publishers picking up pieces in different domains.

Why were the experiences of Schott and UE and their two respective
composers so different? On the surface, the firms seem similar: both
were small, family-owned businesses, the former headquartered in the
heart of Rheinhessen in Mainz, the latter located symbolically within the
opulent and tradition-soaked Musikverein on the Karlsplatz in Vienna. The
National Socialists so closely identified both of them with decadent
developments in music that their house journals, Schott's <I>Melos</I>,
which was renamed and retooled in 1934, and UE's <I>Anbruch</I>, which
ceased publication in 1937, shared a panel at the 1938 "Entartete Musik"
in D&uuml;sseldorf, captioned: "In these pages was Cultural Bolshevism
nurtured!" (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Despite the inclusion of Hindemith and Stravinsky, UE and its composers
 held pride of place at that exhibition. After Stravinsky had vociferously
 protested his inclusion as "absolutely inadmissible," he received (and
 relayed to Strecker) assurances of "benevolent neutrality" henceforth.

founded in 1901 and specializing in new music, UE was considered by
the National Socialist officials to be <I>the</I> Jewish publishing
house. Founded and still owned by Jews at the time of the Anschluss,
managed largely by Jews, with a catalogue populated by a Jewish majority
and a radical leftist minority, UE was also the principal agent in the
West for the Soviet State Publishing House. Any nationalist halo emanating
from its original Bruckner and Strauss holdings had long since dissipated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With a history almost parallel to that of German music itself, Schott,
on the other hand, was still regarded in the 1930s as the venerable
publisher of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Wagner's <I>Ring des
Nibelungen</I>. Its owners, Ludwig Strecker, Sr., and two of his sons,
Wilhelm and Ludwig, Jr., were Aryan. Each of them had dutifully submitted
a completed questionnaire to that effect to the Reichsmusikkammer,
Fachverband Musikalien-Verleger (Assembly of Music Publishers).
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Tracing their Aryan lineage back through the requisite two generations
 on both mother's and father's sides, they confirmed that the "Konfession"
 of their forebears in every case had been "evangelisch," i.e., religion:
 Protestant. All three Streckers also certified that they had never
 belonged to the Communist Party or any other subversive political
 entities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Willy left unanswered the question concerning former and
present party affiliations, Ludwig Jr. listed his as <I>Deutschnationale
Volkspartei</I>. However, by the mid-thirties it was widely rumored in
Mainz that Ludwig Jr., a doctor of law and tournament tennis player, was
"a Nazi"--if not an actual member, then a strong supporter of the party.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 But Robert Craft's published report of Samuel Dushkin's assertion that
 "Ludwig was a Nazi party member" cannot be verified from existing
 records; among the applications for party membership or the membership
 rolls themselves there is no listing for Ludwig Strecker, Jr. or any
 of his known pen-names.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Hermann Reutter, a composer published exclusively by Schott, recalled
 in 1980 that he had joined the Nazi party in 1933 at the prompting of
 Ludwig Strecker.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 That same year, under the pseudonym of Ludwig Andersen, Strecker supplied
 the text for Reutter's cantata <I>Der gro&szlig;e Kalender</I> ,
 which was performed at the opening of the Reichsmusikkammer in 1933 and
 then hailed by Hans Hinkel as "<I>the</I> oratorio of the Third Reich."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Strecker also wrote the librettos for some of the Reich's most
 successful nationalist operas (many of which were published by Schott),
 including Werner Egk's <I>Die Zaubergeige</I>  which received 198
 performances prior to 1945, and Reutter's <I>Doktor Johannes Faust</I>
 , which received 116 performances.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Besides the questionnaire, the only document preserved in Ludwig
 Strecker's Reichsmusikkammer file is a letter of 27 October 1942,
 requesting a fifteen-minute appointment from then Ministerialdirektor
 Hans Hinkel. It ends with the nearly obligatory "Heil Hitler!" Hitler
 himself had sent official congratulations to Ludwig, Sr., on the occasion
 of his diamond wedding anniversary earlier in the year.

With few exceptions (most prominently Ernst Toch and Erich Korngold),
at the time of Hitler's ascent to power the vast majority of Schott's
composers were also "Aryan," and largely untainted by radical politics
of the left. During the next decade, the Streckers took into the Schott
catalogue the most performed composers of the period, including Egk,
Reutter, Ernst Pepping, and Wolfgang Fortner, as well as more

<B></B>

than a few politically correct but musically insipid composers such as
Hans Gansser. With Carl Orff headlining a roster left largely intact
after the purge of non-Aryan composers (and eventually also Hindemith
and Stravinsky), Schott could now claim undisputed first place in
the publication of new music in Germany. In 1940 the firm boasted
that seven contemporary operas it had published were in permanent
repertory, including several with librettos by Ludwig Andersen
(<I>MiTR</I>, 163). The firm enjoyed similar success in the domain
of orchestral music. During this time Schott also discreetly deleted
from its catalogue compositions that were likely to be most offensive
to the new regime. Orff's cantatas with texts by Werfel and Brecht,
and Hindemith's early one-act operas, including <I>Nusch-Nuschi</I>
and <I>Sancta Susanna</I>, were "taken off the market" and placed in
what Strecker called "the poison cupboard."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Prior to the ban on performance of Hindemith's music, Strecker tried to
 convince cultural administrators that the composer had never written
 "cheap successes" as Weill and Krenek had, Hindemith did not
 owe his success to "Jewish cliques and critics," and his "positive,
 constructive music" should not be compared with "the decadent
 intellectual musical efforts of a Schoenberg."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Without any attempt to disguise the family's and firm's anti-Semitism,
 Strecker persuaded both Stravinsky and Hindemith to take the precaution
 of certifying their racial purity and ideological indifference well in
 advance of any necessity to do so.

If Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel had led the march into the field of
Nazi propaganda music, Schott was not too far behind. Already in 1931,
Schott had published a collection of "hearth and home" songs under the
title <I>Deutsche Heimat</I> (<I>German Homeland</I>) edited by Ludwig
Andersen. It was reprinted several times during the next decade and
often took pride of place in Schott's advertisements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Soon after Hitler became chancellor in 1933, Schott published
 the <I>Badonviller Marsch</I>, Hitler's "official entrance music"
 (roughly the equivalent of "Hail to the Chief" for the President of
 the United States). The following year Hermann Blume's "Adolf Hitler
 Fanfare" appeared in the same series of <I>M&auml;rsche f&uuml;r
 Blasorchester</I>. Schott also printed in 1934 <I>Neues Deutschland</I>
 (or: <I>New Germany</I>), a songbook intended for use by the SA, and
 <I>Junges Deutschland</I> (or: <I>Young Germany</I>), a set of newly
 composed songs by Armin Knab extolling the achievements of National
 Socialism (<I>MiTR</I>,152).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In the early 1940s Schott issued <I>Das neue Soldaten Liederbuch</I>,
 edited by Fr. J. Breuer, in three volumes, with color-coded covers
 adorned by the same picture of two young German soldier-singers in full
 uniform (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_5.html"> 5</A>). "The best-known and best-loved songs of our armed
 forces," Schott advertised. Many of the songs in the collection had
 been previously published by other firms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Hans Gansser's <I>K&auml;mpfen hei&szlig;t leben: Weihe-, Kampf- und
 Sturmlieder der Zeit f&uuml;r Gemeinsamkeits- und Einzelvortrag</I>
 (or: <I>To Struggle is To Live: Contemporary Songs of Dedication,
 ting, and Attacking for Group or Individual Delivery</I>)
 comprised fourteen songs for voice and piano; its frontispiece
 carried an explicit dedication to Adolf Hitler. Published in 1944,
 it contained songs entitled "Gel&ouml;bnis an den F&uuml;hrer"
 ("Praise to the F&uuml;hrer") and "Ein F&uuml;hrer, Volk und Reich"
 ("One F&uuml;hrer, People, and Reich") (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_6.html"> 6</A>). An advertisement on
 the back cover for other compositions by Gansser published by Schott
 included "Der Frontsoldat" ("The Sodier at the

<B></B>

Front") and "Kampfesmut und Treue" ("Courage for Combat and Sadness") for
unison mass chorus, "Heldische Trauermusik" ("Heroic Music of Sadness")
and an arrangement of the Marschlied der SS von Kurt Eggers, "Kamerad,
die Schicksalsstunde schl&auml;gt" ("Comrade, the Hour of Destiny Calls").

Such displays of loyalty to the cause apparently afforded Schott
considerable latitude in the conduct of its daily operations,
in addition to an uninterrupted cash flow. Even after the ban on
performances of Hindemith in 1936, Schott continued to publish
his works, including the second part of <I>Unterweisung um
Tonsatz</I> in 1939, which Willy Strecker didn't bother to pass by
the Reichsmusikpr&uuml;fstelle. Hindemith expressed his surprise and
gratitude: "I had many doubts that it would prove possible, so I'm now all
the more delighted. . . . I have the feeling that, for you personally,
this little work was not just a routine publishing item, it is as if an
unusual amount of goodwill and good wishes on the part of the publishers
were printed alongside it (perhaps in this connection with the evil
signs attending its birth), and for this I give you special thanks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 "It was a sport," Strecker later told the composer, "for me to bring
 out all these things [including the violin and cello concertos, Symphony
 in E-flat, <I>The Four Temperaments</I>]

<B></B>

despite the Nazi ban, and fortunately we weren't caught."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The Streckers' considerable diplomatic and tactical skills also kept
 Stravinsky viable in Germany through 1939, even managing to export
 his royalties despite the general embargo against doing so. But the
 Streckers were not always successful in working both sides of the
 street. Schott's new edition of Riemann's <I>Musik-Lexikon</I>,
 replacing Alfred Einstein's eleventh edition of 1929, was halted
 in February 1939 after the letter "D" and 128 pages because, as one
 critic objected, although "the Reich of Adolf Hitler has carried out
 the ultimate separation between what is non-Jewish and what is Jewish
 in the area of cultural, intellectual, and scholarly life, . . . all
 the Jewry that had embedded itself in our culture in the last decades
 is still being honored with extensive tributes."

Meanwhile, the situation at UE was far more complicated. After Emil
Hertzka's death in 1932, ownership of UE vested in Hertzka's widow
Yella, as well as his nephew Alfred Kalmus and niece Marianne Teich,
all of whom were Jewish. Under dire circumstances, Hugo Winter assumed
the position of Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrer (Executive Director) within a
managing triumvirate that included Kalmus and Hans Heinsheimer. Crusades
by the Kampfbund fuer deutscher Kultur had already all but wiped UE works

<B></B>

from the major stages in Germany, the firm was still reeling from effects
of the worldwide depression, and it was precipitously overextended in
its composer obligations for a relatively youthful catalogue, which
had already surpassed ten thousand titles. The large number of Soviet
publications which UE had acquired in the late 1920s at the initiative
of Kalmus, who was fluent in Russian, would also soon become a liability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nearly bankrupt, UE was particularly ill-equipped to weather the
impending crisis, as it had assembled only the most haphazard array of
foreign representatives and subpublishers. When Alban Berg reported to
Schoenberg in October 1933 that UE had suspended payment of his monthly
stipend of 1,000 schillings, Schoenberg replied from Paris: "What you tell
me about UE is very unfortunate. I'd like to make a suggestion to you:
perhaps UE would be prepared to join forces with a second publisher. I
imagine one could find a wealthy publishing house willing to advance
the necessary funds if UE gave them a share of the profits!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although eventually UE reinstated to Berg a monthly stipend of 500
 shillings, he suggested to Schoenberg and Franz Schreker that they
 consider forming an association of UE composers in order to protect their
 interests. Schreker had also complained to Schoenberg that an engaged and
 indolent UE was doing "nothing more than allowing things to take their
 course and is quite possibly in league with the prevailing current."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Schreker confronted Heinsheimer directly: "Isn't it about time for the
 publisher to undertake some initiative for my works? Especially now,
 at least <I>abroad</I>, despite the fact that I'm not under any kind
 of boycott here."

Alfred Kalmus did indeed travel to Paris, London, and New York
(where he was disappointed to find that the 1933 Broadway production
of <I>Threepenny Opera</I> was a dud), but his efforts yielded very
few immediate tangible results. In August 1935, Berg reported on UE's
continuing misfortunes: "several weeks ago director Winter's wife and
[Erwin] Stein's father both died on the same day. (Shortly before that,
Heinsheimer's father and uncle). And poor Stein has been seriously ill
for a terribly long time now."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Responding to the recent trends in German theaters, UE opened a new
 operetta division (Wiener Operetten Verlag) to address the burgeoning
 demand for such entertainments. In January 1935, Heinsheimer informed
 Weill, who was then living in Paris: "We have now expanded our stage
 activity and have branched out from the narrow confines of opera. We're
 already preparing several plays-with-music, and one of them has
 been placed in the Theater in der Josefstadt here, in London, and in
 Prague. . . . I would be very pleased if we could also do business
 together again."

UE continued to publish and promote new works by the dwindling group
of composers in its catalog still performable, including Berg's
<I>Symphonische St&uuml;cke aus "Lulu"</I> and violin concerto,
Kod&aacute;ly's <I>T&auml;nze aus Galanta</I> and <I>Te Deum</I>,
Bart&oacute;k's fifth string quartet, Webern's op. 27 Variations for
Piano, as well as works by Alfredo Casella, Othmar Schoeck, Franz
Schmidt, and a number of minor Austrian composers. Building on the
precedent of Weill's <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft</I>, Wagner-R&eacute;geny
and Caspar Neher picked up some of the slack in the opera department,
with <I>Der G&uuml;nstling</I> (<I>The Favorite</I>) premiering in Dresden
in 1935. But soon, one by one, UE's leaders fled the firm. Alfred Kalmus
relocated to London in 1936 and opened a branch of UE there, but he failed
to transfer or fully safeguard copyrights, manuscripts, and stock. During
the war Universal Edition London operated under the aegis of Boosey &amp;
Hawkes, which had also offered employment to UE's house editor, Erwin
Stein, and its head of publications, Ernst Roth. Arriving in New York the
day before Hitler marched into Vienna, Heinsheimer decided not to return;
he joined the American branch of Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Hugo Winter hung
on at UE until 1939, when he moved to New York as vice-president of
Associated Music Publishers. UE therefore lost its entire management
team to other firms in London or New York.

Although AMP was nominally as much UE's American representative as it
was Schott's, it seems barely to have functioned as such. Because UE
had suspended its contracts with many of its "entartete" composers,
who then signed on with other publishing companies, it could not merely
transfer its publishing obligations and operations to London or New York,
as Schott had done in the cases of Stravinsky and Hindemith. In July 1937,
Weill, in New York for almost two years but still apparently unaware of
AMP's existence, felt it necessary to write directly to Kalmus in Vienna
(apparently unaware that he had already departed for London): "After such
a long time, my main reason for writing is to ask you to send me as soon
as possible several copies of all my works that appeared with Universal
Edition. . . . I am starting to get requests from different quarters

 by the most petty devices, he was then taken to Gestapo headquarters
 at the Hotel Metropole in Vienna, where he was incarcerated in a tiny
 room on the fifth floor for the next seventeen months. There, with the
 towel issued to him for his personal use, he was forced to clean the
 quarters, washbasins, slop buckets and latrines of the S.S. guards and
 perform other various menial tasks thought up by the Gestapo. By March

Internal documents also confirm that UE was allowed, even encouraged,
to export degenerate music to enemy territories, thereby benefiting from
both the influx of foreign currency and the material's potential for
moral corruption abroad. A comprehensive directive dated 14 April 1939
(<A HREF="8.1kowalke_7.html"> 7</A>) declares that works by Jewish composers that could no longer
be sold in Germany and Austria could still be exported. Editions by
Jews of classical works, exemplified by Heinrich Schenker's volume
of Beethoven sonatas, are exempt from the domestic ban for the time
being. Anthologies must be cleansed of Jewish contributions by the new
year, while the manner in which historical res such as Mendelssohn
are to be handled remains unresolved for the time being. Doubtful cases
are to be referred to Mr. Deczey (whom Schlee also mentioned in his
1946 letter to Weill). Deczey would then check the "J&uuml;den-Alphabet"

an annotated list of all of UE's publications, ordered by plate number

several printed "Nummernverzeichnis" and handwritten addenda, including
one for the Wiener Operetten Verlag. The lists were color-coded,
with red lines drawn through items which could no longer be sold
domestically and blue lines through editions of Aryan composers
by Jews and other questionable titles. The list of "red composers"
extended from Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Thalberg, and Offenbach to all
Jewish contemporary composers and many Russian composers. The remaining
"white" group included Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, Krenek, Casella,
Szymanowski, Tiessen, Malipiero, Benatzky, Zemlinsky, Bart&oacute;k,
Kod&aacute;ly, Jan&aacute;cek, Satie, and Johann Strau&szlig;

Officials first placed UE under the supervision of the brothers Robert

Schott was chosen to take over ownership of its archrival. But soon both
Goebbels and G&ouml;ring were displeased with Schott's "unreliable"
stewardship. Goebbels's diary entries in mid-December 1940 make brief
reference to the matter: "We are absolutely right about the Schott
affair. This firm has no right to put on airs as if it's been Aryanized"
(14 December 1940). The following day, he wrote, "The question of

 Aryanized in 1939 under the former head of Schott's own periodical
 division, Johannes Petschull. The firm thereafter was known as
 Petschull-Universal Edition. After the war, Willy Strecker confirmed

 Schlee, whose name did not appear in the April 1939 directive, recalled
 that UE was fortunate to have decent individuals as commissarial
 administrators, who even made possible the emigration of Hugo Winter in
 1939. Prior to the war, "export to foreign countries still functioned,"
 Schlee observed, "as the Nazis' need for foreign currency exceeded
 their concern over promulgating the same kind of cultural goods they
 had been ting against."

 Publishing continued on a greatly reduced scale, with Bohuslav Martinu
 entering the catalogue in 1939; Frank Martin, Eugen Suchon, Willy
 Burkhard, and Karl Schiske in 1940; Theodor Berger

<B></B>

and Alfred Uhl in 1941; Gottfried von Einem in 1943. Among the important
works that appeared after March 1938 were Webern's <I>Das Augenlicht</I>
and the op. 24 Concerto , Frank Schmidt's <I>Buch mit 7 Siegeln</I>
, Martinu's Concerto grosso , Bart&oacute;k's Piano Concerto
#2 , and Martin's <I>In Terra Pax</I> . UE seems to have been
spared coercion to publish the type of obsequiously patriotic material
that its German counterparts were producing at the time. UE continued its
series of regional folk-song collections, including <I>Volkslieder und
Jodler um den Schneeberg und Semmering in Niederdonau</I> (<I>Folksongs
and Yodels from the Area of Schneeber and Semmering in Lower Donau</I>)
. It also published works by such minor composers as Leo Justinus
Kauffmann, whose <I>Abendkantate</I> appeared under the imprint of
"Universal Edition Dr. Johannes Petschull."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Without access to internal correspondence files, it is impossible to
determine the degree of autonomy from Petschull and Peters that UE
actually enjoyed. Schlee said nothing about his own day-to-day function
within the firm, except to claim that his "immediate concern was not
dedicated to the present, but to the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 He emphasized, however, that he had employed his friend Anton von
 Webern to arrange, proofread, make piano-vocal scores, and appraise
 submissions. Webern accompanied Schlee to Switzerland in 1943, despite
 stringent passport regulations, to hear Hermann Scherchen conduct
 the premiere of the op. 30 Variations for Orchestra, for which UE
 had furnished the newly copied orchestra parts. Dallapiccola gives an
 eyewitness account of an evening in March 1942 at Schlee's apartment,
 with the "usually subdued" Webern turning red in the face and exploding
 at the mention of Kurt Weill's name: "What trace can <I>you</I> find
 in such a composer of our great Central European tradition?"--an
 almost verbatim recitation of the indictments of Weill in official
 Nazi publications.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Schlee's only published firsthand account of this period, barely a page
long, he recalled that "even in Nazi circles there existed something akin
to an Austrian patriotism," which allowed the musical treasures of UE to
be "semi-officially transported out of town and hidden mostly in churches"
as a precaution against destruction by Allied bombing--with Gauleiter
Baldur von Schirach looking the other way. Schlee said that in one rural
church the "works of Weill and Schoenberg were stored behind the organ,"
and that other "precious materials" were stored in the Ransau region,
others in a monastery near Zwettl and in his own family's summer house
near Semmering. The husband of Susan Kalmus, Stephan Harpner, who became
a director of UE after the war, remembers that some materials had also
been hidden in the bakery of Erwin Ratz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Inconsistencies in chronology, personnel, and geography within
 UE's corporate memory are probably suggestive of the improvised
 and clandestine nature of these various attempts to preserve UE's
 valuables. Apparently no inventory lists were made or kept, because even
 years later UE was unsure of what had been preserved. In February 1952,
 for example, UE responded to a cabled request from AMP for a copy of the
 full score of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I>: "We suppose it has been lost
 during the war." A day later, however, the head of UE's stage department
 wrote, without any apparent sense of irony: "We are able to send it to
 you. This full score is Kurt Weill's handwritten



copy and very precious. We therefore ask you kindly to take care of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 <I>Mahagonny</I>, which, Schlee said, had been carried off by the
 Gestapo, did not turn up for several more years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Gestapo," Schlee recollected in 1988, "came to UE only once and
confiscated strangely enough, only Weill and Schenker." (So peculiar a
pairing are Weill and Schenker that subsequent retellings of this tale
have treated Schenker as a typographical error and invariably transformed
Schenker into Schreker.) UE's internal records are informative on this
point, actually documenting <I>two</I> visits by the Gestapo, on 9 April
and 26 April 1940. According to entries in the archive books of the
production department, during its first visit the Gestapo confiscated
approximately 33,000 copies of forty-five different publications of
songs, choral music, piano-vocal scores and librettos of operas. With one
exception (862 copies of the <I>Arbeiterlieder</I> by Anatol Rathaus),
they were all compositions by Eisler (totalling 24,064 copies) and Weill
(8,305 copies). Most of the items boasted texts by Bertolt Brecht.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 On its second visit, on 26 April, the Gestapo took away much less
 material: approximately 160 copies each of three songs from Bela
 Reinitz's 1930 Singspiel <I>Schatten &uuml;ber Haarlem</I>, plus 226
 copies of two other songs by Reinitz; and some 800 copies of writings by
 the hypernationalist Heinrich Schenker, including <I>Harmonielehre</I>
 II/1 , II/2 , <I>Der freie Satz</I>, Textband , Notenband
 .
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Lexikon der Juden in der Musik</I>, Schenker is, in fact,
 denounced as "the principal representative of an abstract music
 theory favoring that kind of Jewish philosophy which disavows any
 inner psychological content and instead confines itself to detecting
 arbitrarily and out of context an 'Urlinie'."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Asserting that Schenker's basic ideas had been widely disseminated,
 the entry proves the point of Kurt Tucholsky's <I>bon mot</I>, "The
 Nazis weren't interested in an artist's body of work, only his foreskin."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Records for rented performance materials in UE's hire library indicate
that only those for Weill's <I>B&uuml;rgschaft</I> (<I>Security</I>)and
two versions of <I>Mahagonny</I> and Reinitz's <I>Schatten &uuml;ber
Haarlem</I> were confiscated, and no date is specified. A list of
printing plates that were either sent to Peters in Leipzig or consigned
to the Reichstelle f&uuml;r Metalle to be recycled for the war effort
is much longer. Because this list of 100 items contains no "entartete"
composers and several revered ones (including Bach, Beethoven, and Verdi),
this selection appears to be a combination of expendable titles with
negligible future potential and classic works that were to be taken over
by Peters. There is no extant record of confiscation of any holograph
scores. Given the highly selective nature of the list of materials that
were confiscated, it is intriguing to speculate whether the Gestapo had
entered UE with a carefully considered shopping list of symbolic works
or if the secret police were advised by Petschull-UE employees, with only
the currently most unperformable or unsalable works conveniently laid out
for their consideration. In either case, the event is worthy of a film
script: imagine a close-up of Schoenberg's holographs piled atop Weill's
(the only music in the world in which, Schoenberg had claimed, he could
find no quality whatsoever) as they both hid behind the monastery organ;
then crossfade to copies of the 1935 edition of <I>Der freie Satz</I>
by Schenker rubbing spines in the crates with Brecht, Weill, and Eisler
as they are carried off by the Gestapo.

Schlee's letter to Weill in 1946 can now be read in a more nuanced
context. The Gestapo had indeed confiscated <I>Mahagonny</I>--not
Weill's holograph score, but UE's printed materials, thus begging several
questions: at that time, where were the plates from which the music would
eventually be reprinted in the mid-1950s? And where, fifteen months after
war's end, was the holograph score? (Perhaps it was still waiting with
Schoenberg's <I>Erwartung</I> behind the organ?) Why were these treasures,
which allegedly had been Schlee's primary concern between 1938 and 1945,
now unretrieved? Most of Weill's holographs would eventually turn up
at UE in the mid 1950s, but only after repeated inquiries from Lenya
and would-be producers. If Schlee's account of the Gestapo's visit
seems incomplete and partially secondhand, he may have had more direct
knowledge about the loss of some other Weill materials. Still missing, for
example, is an item prominently displayed in facsimile at the "Entartete
Musik" exhibition in D&uuml;sseldorf, which opened ten weeks after the
<I>Anschluss</I>. The musical excerpt displayed in the poster (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_0.html"> 10</A>)
comprises the final three measures of Weill's holograph pre-rehearsal
score of the "Ballade vom angenehmen Leben," which he had sent UE in 1928
for the purpose of preparing rehearsal and performance materials. Only
someone with access to UE's archives could have made this contribution
to Weill's defamation. His identity remains a mystery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An event which may have left Weill with what Schlee called "a very
bad impression" was the disappearance, in 1933, of a parcel containing
virtually all of Weill's unpublished early works, including, most likely,
the op. 5 <I>Divertimento</I>, the orchestral cycle

<B></B>

of Rilke's <I>Stundenbuch</I>, <I>Recordare</I>, <I>Zaubernacht</I>,
and the symphonic <I>Fantasia, Passacaglia, und Hymnus</I>. In 1932
Weill had lent these and other scores to musicologist Walter Fleischer,
who was working on a volume about the composer to follow one on
Stravinsky. Fleischer vividly recalled the circumstances: "I was in
Italy, and knowing nothing of Weill's whereabouts after March 1933, I
mailed the package of scores to the Berlin office of Universal Edition,
in care of Alfred Schlee. In December 1933, when I saw Weill again at a
performance of <I>Mahagonny</I> in Rome, I told him what I'd done with
his manuscripts. Although he expressed no surprise at the disappearance
of the package, at the mention of Schlee's name, Weill silently wagged
his right forefinger twice: left-right, left-right."

Characterizing the period from 1934 to 1938 as one of "hopeless lethargy,"
Schlee says almost nothing, despite the title of his contribution,
about the "seven years of trumpets and concentration camps" since
the Anschluss. Noting that Berg, Webern, and Hauer had been "neither
honored nor oppressed," but rather "treated with derision," Schlee
thanked the "alien nations that supported all those whom the brutal
northern invader drove out of their country," including Schoenberg and
Krenek. Schlee devotes the remainder of his brief essay to an

Schlee's poetic portrayal of the martyred Webern seems to have been
calculated to discourage doubts about any unresolved discords still
reverberating from Schoenberg's anguished and unanswered question put
to his former student in June 1937: "Is it true that you have become a
supporter, or even a member of the Nazi Party?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 (Although there is no evidence that Webern ever joined the party,
 virtually everyone in his immediate

family did, with his son Peter, who was killed in the war, and one
of his sons-in-law particularly rabid partisans. Until recently, most
biographers and critics have accepted the testimony of Webern's daughter,
Amalie Waller: "The occupation of Austria by Hitler was a terrific blow
for my father. Not only was his music banned and outlawed because it
belonged to the category of 'degenerate art,' but all doors and gates
were barred for the conductor and teacher Webern."

By recounting the hardships which the "other-worldly" bystander Webern
had endured during and immediately after the war at the hands of both its
perpetrators and, inadvertently, its victors, his friend and publisher
Schlee was still looking "beyond the present" to "a time afterwards" and
laying the groundwork for the heroicization of the "anst&auml;ndiger
Mensch" ("decent man") Webern. But as the disturbing "trotzdem"
("nevertheless") of Webern's own case, his enthusiastic embrace of
Hitler and National Socialist ideology, has gradually and painfully been
revealed in subsequent decades, Schlee's messianic mythology has collapsed
into willful historical fiction. A more accurate, and necessarily less
sympathetic, portrait suggests a metaphor more apt than Schlee's biblical
one. Webern had indeed suffered, but as a tragic Greek hero, whose fatal
flaw was an inability or unwillingness to integrate or reconcile his
life and art. Absent evidence to corroborate the testimony of Webern's
daughter that the occupation of Austria by Hitler was a terrific blow
for her father or Robert Craft's claims that the Nazis banned his music,
burned his writings, and forbade him all activity, Webern's purported
persecution for his aesthetic allegiance to twelve-tone composition now
must also be doubted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 The wartime neglect of his music can no longer believably be ascribed to
 official governmental proscription or censorship on racial, political,
 or aesthetic grounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although his music had been performed only rarely before the National
Socialists came to power, Webern's portrayal as a "suppressed" composer
of "subversive" music became a crucial component of post-war modernist
strategies to turn away from a corrupt recent past and claim for serialism
the highest moral ground, as the only alternative truly responsive to
the horrors of the recent past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 However, with Webern as standard bearer, post-war serialists, asserted
 Hans Werner Henze, actually sought to restore music to "a state of
 purity as if nothing had happened; as if there were no class struggle, no
 imperialism, no wars, as if society were in order; as though everything
 were as untouched as blades of grass high in the Alps."
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 "It was precisely its utopian (its 'scientific') aspect, as well as
 the myth of its political suppression," Richard Taruskin

<B></B>

has observed, "that facilitated serialism's seeming natural selection
as the neomodernist lingua franca from out of the ashes of the Second
World War."
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 Because the post-war construction of a new ethical framework for music
 after Auschwitz depended on the belief of the historical imperative
 and aesthetic superiority of serialism, the depoliticization of modern
 music required the depoliticization of Anton Webern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By detaching the discovery which was supposed to have assured the
supremacy of German music for a hundred years from its ideological origins
and socio-political ramifications, Schlee posited, already in 1946,
a key component in what would become the dominant historical narrative
of twentieth-century music. (Its prevalence and longevity is evinced
in so recent a survey as Arnold Whittall's <I>Musical Composition in
the Twentieth Century</I> [1999], which still glosses Webern's politics
and wartime conduct as merely "right-wing sympathies" and then dismisses
them as irrelevant because "the music's qualities transcend rather than
helplessly implement its ideological context.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Thus, years before Pierre Boulez, one of UE's first post-war recruits,
 announced that "Schoenberg Is Dead" and admonished the musical world not
 "to forget that a certain Webern also labored," Schlee had anointed
 his friend as the only reliable guide into "the Promised Land," the
 rightful interpreter of "the sacred Tablets of Law."
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Alfred Kalmus decided to remain in London after the war, Schlee
took over operations in Vienna. From that strategic base, he quickly
claimed the role of chief architect of its high modernist edifice,
built substantially on the foundations of the already proliferating
martyrology of Webern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 Schlee recruited a youthful roster of composers rivaling Hertzka's, but
 with few of the eclectics, dissenters, and populists who had balanced the
 Second Viennese School within UE's catalogue during the interwar period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 With Boulez and Stockhausen quickly emerging as its principal spokesmen
 and, after 1955, the new UE-periodical <I>Die Reihe: Information
 &uuml;ber serielle Musik</I> serving as its propagandist mouthpiece,
 what Henze described as "official musical thinking" adopted Webern's
 procedures as its foundation, "whose maxims the body of lesser mortals
 now had to put into practice (allowing for seasonal variation) with
 religious devotion, esprit de corps and slavish obedience"(<I>BFAA</I>,
 43). Disillusioned by the confusion of moral and aesthetic criteria which
 "demanded that every deviation from the officially prescribed rules and
 regulations be denounced and punished without a moment's delay," Henze
 came to equate the enforced homogeneity of serial music in the 1950s with
 lingering fascism in his homeland: "so many people who had had a hand
 in things were now carrying on as if nothing had happened. . . . With
 the coming of the first strict serial compositions, the least glimmer
 of any political spark was finally extinguished in the midst of their
 creators" (<I>BFAA</I>, 34).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Henze returned to Darmstadt in 1955 to give a composition class with
Boulez and Bruno Maderna, he recalled that "anything that wasn't Webernian
was brusquely dismissed" (<I>BFAA</I>, 43). Other than Henze, very few
composers managed to resist the imperatives of what was already being
called "The Age of Webern." As a consequence of Webern's prime directive
that "all art must be constructed according to laws," on both sides
of the Atlantic "his scores were pored over in theory and composition
classes like Talmudic texts," with disdain heaped on any who resisted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 When Boulez dared

<B></B>

even to assert that "any musician who has not experienced . . . the
necessity for the dodecaphonic languages is <I>useless</I>, for his
whole work is irrelevant to the needs of the epoch," dissenters began
to speak of a new sort of "tyranny" surrounding Webern's oeuvre.
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 Even the seventy-three year old Stravinsky "came under the spell"
 and penned a short preface for the second issue of <I>Die Reihe</I>,
 dedicated exclusively to Webern on the occasion of the tenth anniversary
 of his death: "We must hail not only this great composer but also a
 real hero."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 "There are heroes, and there are composers," quipped Schoenberg in 1944,
 suggesting that Shostakovich had (unfortunately) allowed politics to
 influence his compositional style: "Heroes can be composers and vice
 versa, but you cannot require it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 That admonition pertains to music publishers as well. On the occasion of
 their ninetieth birthdays, Ludwig Strecker (who had outlived his brother
 Willy by 20 years) and Alfred Schlee were both duly feted on a heroic
 scale. In honor of Strecker, Schott published a 425-page <I>Festschrift
 f&uuml;r einen Verleger</I>. Among its 46 distinguished contributors
 were composers Francaix, Henze, Ligeti, Tippett, not to mention
 Philipp Jarnach and Werner Egk; musicologists and critics included
 Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht, Rudolph Stephan, H. H. Stuckenschmidt, and
 Helmut Federhofer. Carl Orff contributed the opening rhapsody, "Dank an
 Ludwig Strecker"; Hermann Reutter followed up with an "Hommage &aacute;
 Ludwig Emanuel Strecker." There is, of course, no hint anywhere in the
 volume of Strecker's own "right-wing sympathies." The <I>Festschrift</I>
 was edited by the doyen of German musicology, Carl Dahlhaus.

Conversely, in 1991, in honor of Schlee's ninetieth birthday, no fewer
than 37 UE-composers wrote tribute pieces, which were then played by a
string quartet at a celebratory concert. Boulez was the official spokesman
for the occasion. "Universal Edition meant for us young composers the
Second Viennese School, and we wanted to belong. . . . And suddenly
we were standing in line with Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, with their
politics, with their artistic goals," Boulez told <I>Die Zeit</I>. He
extolled the virtues of his publisher in terms that now seem rather
ambiguous:

By then, Schlee had, in fact, broken his silence about his pre-1945
years at UE by consenting to be interviewed for a retrospective issue
of the <I>Oesterreichische Musikzeitschrift</I> on the occasion of
the fiftieth anniversary of the Anschluss. The brief published excerpt
from a "detailed interview" with Lothar Knessl began with a disclaimer
that Schlee "did not want to make a contribution concerning his special
service in securing the survival of UE."
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 But his comments were almost entirely restricted to the preservation of
 materials that "would ensure that nothing would happen to put UE into
 a situation in which reestablishment of its international work at 'a

 he said,

Such elliptical generalities, of course, beg for precise particulars:
What did Schlee do in Berlin on a daily basis from 1933 to 1938, or
in Vienna from 1938 to 1945, other than looking beyond the present to
preserve UE's future? Was he a double-agent, an apolitical, modernist
"mole" in the enemy camp, pretending to answer to Petschull but actually
looking out for Kalmus's interests? Why had so prolific a writer, so
public a performer, so vociferous an advocate prior to the Anschluss,
chosen to remain virtually silent about his activities thereafter? His
"legendary privacy" would be maintained even in death, as his demise was
not announced, even within UE, until after his burial. Obituaries, cobbled
almost exclusively from an official press release belatedly issued by UE,
offer no new information to affirm, contradict, or supplement the hazy
picture of a modest and largely unsung hero of modern music.

 Somehow, therefore, it was not a shock to discover that even the

When Lotte Lenya returned for the first time to Vienna and Berlin in
1955, after twenty years' absence, she reported to a friend back home:
"By now we're used to the rubble, which they clean up religiously and

find a single Nazi in Germany today. It's as if there weren't any."

 Apparently not in music publishing, a field in which collective amnesia
 has conspired to rehabilitate the opportunists, collaborators, and
 stalwarts alike. The deeds of the Petschulls and Streckers were quickly
 forgotten, forgiven, or transred, those of the Schlees filtered,
 blandished, and mythologized--all no less quickly and fully than their
 "black," "grey," and "white" political and industrial counterparts under
 the utilitarian policies adopted first by the occupation forces and
 then Christian-conservative politicians, as they tried to reconstruct
 Germany and Austria. Despite the difficulty today of disentangling
 aesthetic and musical issues from ideological, political, racialist, and
 personal ones, it is imperative that we begin the process of shedding
 light on the dark side of modern music publishing under the Nazis and
 its continuing impact on contemporary music.

To date Schott has apparently rarely allowed scholars access to its
internal files; UE has recently initiated an in-house inventory and
vetting of documents dating from 1933 to 1945, but they are not yet
available to researchers. I am grateful, however, to Marion von Hartlieb,
Managing Director of UE, and various department heads, who have answered
specific inquiries and provided photocopies of key documents relevant to
my research. In 1998, the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann appointed
an internationally constituted panel of scholars to examine its disputed
history during the Nazi era, when it became the leading publisher of
reading material intended for German soldiers. In a preliminary report
summarized in the <I>New York Times</I>, 18 January 2000, the commission
reported that the company's earnings increased eleven-fold from 1938 to
1941 and that one of its family leaders, Heinrich Mohn, belonged to a
circle of sponsoring members of the SS. After the war Mohn had explained
that "on occasion in earlier years" he had contributed sums to the Nazi
Party "in order to be left alone."

UE, for example, has deposited nearly 40,000 pieces of correspondence with
its composers in the Musiksammlung der Wiener Stadt- und Landesbibliothek,
including those of Schoenberg , Berg , Webern ,
Krenek , Schreker (1,805), Zemlinsky , Weill (1,428),
Casella , Milhaud , Bart&oacute;k , Kod&aacute;ly (1,124),
and Jan&aacute;cek . In some of these cases, however, it is
clear that these collections are not complete, especially during the
period from 1933 to 1945. The most helpful overview of music publishing
during this period is "Responding to the Market: Music Publishing in the
Third Reich," Chapter 6 of Erik Levi's <I>Music in the Third Reich</I>
(New York: St. Martin's Press, 1994), 147-65; hereafter cited within

Hindemith wrote Willy Strecker on 26 April 1940: "I have had a long
letter from Hugo regarding the transfer of the rights and possible
reprint there. He makes some very good and farseeing proposals that will
allow everything to be maintained here on a permanent basis without
in principle making any changes in our mutual relationship--about
which I am very glad" (trans. in Skelton, <I>Selected Letters of Paul
Hindemith</I>, [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995], 161-2,
hereafter referred to as <I>Letters of Hindemith</I>). Associated Music
Publishers (AMP) had been founded in 1927 by Paul Heinicke as an agency
to represent European publishers, including both Schott and Universal
Edition, in the United States. It was subsequently purchased by BMI
(Broadcast Music Incorporated). After the war, AMP returned copyrights
in many wartime compositions to the European parent firms. For example,
on 8 November 1946, it assigned to Schott the copyright in Stravinsky's
<I>Danse concertante</I>, <I>Danse sacrale</I>, and <I>Symphony in Three
Movements</I>. This sort of "shell game," when successfully played,
exempted such works from the administrative bureaucracy of agencies such
as the U.S. Office of the Custodian of Alien Property, which administered
copyrights that fell under the provisions of the Enemy Alien Act. In
contrast, Weill requested the Custodian of Alien Property "to take over
the copyrights" of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> in 1942, because Felix
Bloch Erben and Universal Edition "have been taken over long ago by the
Nazis and since <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> was one of the first plays
which was banned by the Nazi government" (Letter to Howard Reinheimer,
10 November 1942; copy in the Weill-Lenya Research Center, New York).

Letter from Hindemith to Willy Strecker, 30 May 1941; <I>Letters of
Hindemith</I>, 177. In 1933, at the urging of Richard Strauss, Goebbels's
Ministry had established STAGMA (Staatlich genehmigte Gesellschaft zur
Verwertung musikalischer Urheberrechte) as a new system for collecting
and distributing royalties for the use of copyright music. Even after
they had been expelled from the Reichsmusikkammer or the country,
many non-Aryan or otherwise undesirable composers were allowed to keep
their memberships in STAGMA so that foreign royalties would continue to
flow into Germany, where they were often then impounded. Kurt Weill,
in contrast, had resigned from the German organization, effective 30
September 1933, and joined the parallel Italian society.

On 3 April, Heinsheimer wrote Weill that "the last eight days have been
so catastrophic that we are at present absolutely in the dark about the
further conduct of German business. Director [Hugo] Winter has gone to
Berlin in order to get information there and to see if there are any
prospects at all there. Under such circumstances, we will have to ask
you to accept 500 marks for April." Heinsheimer enclosed a personal
note with the official letter: "We are naturally quite aware of your
difficult position and will not leave you high and dry. But you must
understand the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves. The
German boycott, whose unofficial effects will be still worse than the
official ones, hits us squarely in the face." Weill responded immediately:
"I would like to say once again that I made a concession on this point
only because the understanding and trust that you and UE have for my
works seems great enough to warrant my making financial sacrifices,
which are not easy for me at the present time" (3 April 1933).

The matter was finally resolved, after months of heated correspondence,
in October 1933 at a meeting between Alfred Kalmus and Weill. The terms
of the settlement were summarized in a letter from Weill to UE dated 19
November 1933: UE would pay Weill the reduced stipends, and Weill agreed
to pay UE two percent of his future income deriving from his works, plus
additional sums if his income should exceed 100,000 francs. Meanwhile,
on 31 October 1933 Weill had signed a new contract with the Parisian
music publisher Heugel.

yesterday in Braunschweig), while <I>Firebird</I> is played . . . all
over Germany!" On 6 August 1938, Stravinsky reported to Strecker
that an official response to his protest had arrived: "you and your
publisher may count on a benevolent neutrality." On 21 November 1938,
Strecker reassured Stravinsky that "the exhibit seems already to have
been forgotten in Germany." For an account of their reactions to the
incident, see <I>Stravinsky: Selected Correspondence,</I> 3:265-70.

Lys Symonette, n&eacute;e Bertlies Weinschenk, who lived in Mainz until

player, since he was invited to play in national tournaments. I shared
gymnastic lessons with his daughters Elsbeth and Marion and also played
a great deal of tennis with both of them. His only son, who went to
school with my cousin Fritz, died in the war from a fever contracted
at the Russian front. There had always been rumors that Ludwig Strecker
was a Nazi, but he was probably too shrewd to become a registered party

Cables from from UE to AMP, 1, 2 February; letter from 4 February
1952; photocopies in the Weill-Lenya Research Center, New York. See Kim
H. Kowalke, "<I>The Threepenny Opera</I>: The Score Adapted," in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper: A Facsimile of the Holograph Full Score</I>, Kurt Weill
Edition, Series 4, Volume 1 (Valley Forge, Pa.: European American Music,
1996), 11. UE had not printed a full score of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I>,
as it supplied theaters with only a cued piano-conductor score. In 1985,
during my first trip to Vienna as the administrator of Weill's legacy, I
met Alfred Schlee, who was still serving as Artistic Director of UE at age
84. I requested to see the holograph score of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I>,
which was on deposit at the Wiener Stadt- und Landesbibliothek. From
his office in the Musikverein where pride of place was given over to
Webern's piano, Schlee dispatched Karl Heinz F&uuml;ssl, who had edited
the score for the 1972 Philharmonia Partitur No. 400, to retrieve the
manuscript. F&uuml;ssl returned, score in hand, its frail overleaf covered
with raindrops (their effects are still visible on it today). "It's
pouring out there," he muttered. Rendered almost speechless with the
realization that he had carried the holograph from the library without
any protection whatsoever during a heavy rainstorm, I suggested that
such treatment was inappropriate for so precious an artifact. F&uuml;ssl
laughed nervously, and, directing his comment more to Schlee than to me,
said that "Weill and Eisler didn't care about such things anyway." Since
1998 all holograph scores of works published by UE have been on deposit
in the Sibley Music Library at the University of Rochester.

another of Schoenberg's students, and Paul von Klenau, who defended
the twelve-tone compositional principle as "totalitarian" and thus
"entirely appropriate to the future direction of the 'National Socialist

Whittall, 217. Whittall attempts to differentiate Webern's case from

anti-Semitism and his works is "impressive." Whittall objects to Richard
Taruskin's characterization of Webern's String Quartet as his "most
stringently constrained and dehumanized work" and invokes a trope on the
"Webern as victim" conceit: "Taruskin can only offer opinion, supposition,
not fact, and to see the music quite so abjectly reduced to the status
of a sonic sponge absorbing external, cultural factors--though common
in New Musicological writing--is unpersuasive to anyone who feels that,
at the very least, the music's qualities transcend rather than helplessly
implement its ideological content."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What was modernism's relation to the concept of culture? To those
of us who have spent some time with modernism, at least two kinds of
answer might suggest themselves right away. One would fix on modernism's
ambivalent entanglement with "high culture" at its demandingly highest,
and find its icons in writers like T. W. Adorno (railing against the
culture industry on behalf of a bleak and difficult art) or better still
T. S. Eliot (author not only of a poem whose forbidding learnedness helped
to secure its eminence but also, thirty years later, of <I>Notes</I>
reporting that evidence of cultural decline "is visible in every
department of human activity").
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The other sort of answer would play upon a rather different sense
 of "culture": here, res like the Picasso of <I>Les demoiselles
 d'Avignon</I> or the Conrad of <I>Heart of Darkness</I> would evoke
 modern Western art's fascination with non- Western people, objects, and
 texts, and more generally the essential "modernism" of cross-cultural
 contact on an unprecedented scale. The high-culture response and the
 other-culture response both attest to the intimacy of modernism and
 "culture," of course; but contemplated together they also appear as poles
 of a contradiction that can seem--to anyone worn out by the "culture
 wars" of the 1990s, and quite apart from questions about modernism
 per se--more bothersome than generative. The prescriptive sense of the
 oh-so-tired term bids it be esteemed right into impossibility ("culture,"
 since Matthew Arnold, as the perfection of knowledge and manners that
 no one can quite achieve); the descriptive one looks ample to the point
 of meaninglessness ("culture" as a totality hard to differentiate from
 society itself). Why mess with it anymore?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her savvy and important new book, <I>Patterns for America: Modernism
and the Concept of Culture,</I> Susan Hegeman faces squarely the

<B></B>

irritation that "culture" currently produces, arguing both that the
slipperiness of the term is a reason to prize rather than dismiss it, and
that attempts to negotiate between the aforementioned (and still other)
meanings proved crucial to the shaping of a modernism whose consequences
continue to be felt. According to her, "the lineaments of many of the
most visible contemporary debates about 'culture' are residua of the
early Cold War era," and the origins of Cold War formulations themselves
to be discerned in confrontations transpiring in the preceding decades
. It was during the heyday of modernism that those most concerned
with America's ills and possibilities came routinely to invoke "culture"
in their diagnoses; it was in the 1930s most acutely, as Warren Susman
has argued, that Americans came "to do two new things: to understand
themselves as participating in a distinctive 'American' culture, and
to see this culture as a set of patterns, values, and beliefs roughly
comparable to those of other cultures" . For her, in other words,
the roots of our own multicultural panics and pleasures lie in the
young century's effort to fulfill at a stroke culture's descriptive
and prescriptive mandates--to conceive of an American culture whose
virtues would be those of both an American <I>culture</I> (an achieved,
coherent culture where none had existed before) and an <I>American</I>
culture (not better than any other, but right for Americans where any
other would be wrong).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To represent Hegeman's book this way is to make it sound rather more
like <I>Our America</I> --Walter Benn Michaels's strenuously
provocative effort to intervene in the culture wars through a reading
of modernism--than it does in its own voice. Still, it's worth noting up
front that in spite of important disagreements (to be considered further
on), she shares his belief that the crucial link between modernism and the
concept of culture lies in a set of interlocked anxieties about identity
and relativism. For her, then, the new understanding described by Susman
is rendered "complexly modernist" not only by its siting in the first
half of the twentieth century, but also by the "estranged perception of
collective identity" that it enables, its allusion to "the construction
of group identities of a decidedly uneasy and reflexive kind" . Like
Michaels, Hegeman is interested in how unease and reflexivity play around
res such as the immigrant and the Indian (Do they represent an alien
culture, or the most authentically American culture?), and like him,
she finds Americanness at issue in virtually all treatments of culture by
American writers of the period. But where his main project is to disclose
logics of culture and identity as these materialize in prose fiction,
she asks, in addition, where the double sense of "culture" came from,
and how it migrated to the realm of literature, high and low.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Her answer is that one origin, at least, lay in what was coalescing, in
the early years of the century, as an academic discipline with its own
anxieties and enthusiasms. Early in <I>Patterns for America,</I> Hegeman
describes as "typically modernist" a certain oft-told tale in which the
"'Arnoldian' view of culture as the attainment of social and aesthetic
perfection" is "swept away" by "what is often called the 'anthropological'
definition of the term, which is more synonymous with custom, connoting
both the special and the mundane life ways of a given group of people"
. The heroes of this "modernist" story aren't poets, novel-writers,
or artists, however, nor is the scene of combat the Paris of Picasso or
the London of Arnold, Eliot, and Conrad. Rather, the leading personae
are the Columbia University anthropologist Franz Boas and his students;
the scene is New York City; and the tale is, precisely, that of how
comparative ethnography propelled a rethinking of culture and value that
retains its hold on us today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman isn't greatly concerned to disburden this story of its heroism,
but she does revisit it with an impressive array of reconsiderations
and nuances, foremost among them the point that in implicitly opposing
(new, good, democratic) ethnography to (old, Arnoldian, hierarchical)
literary cultivation, the received story obscures important connections
between the Columbia anthropologists and a number of influential literati
centered in Greenwich Village during the same years. These connections
form the heart of <I>Patterns for America,</I> which--as much intellectual
group biography as it is a reading of culture and modernism--might with
no loss of aptness have been called <I>Anthropologists and Bohemians in
New York, 1918 to 1960,</I> or <I>Greenwich</I> 

<B></B>

<I>Village to Morningside Heights: An Interdisciplinary Legacy.</I>
Yet there's nothing misleading about the title the book does have,
for Hegeman shows convincingly how sympathies and disagreements within
her loose New York constellation set the terms for much larger debates
about the forms of American culture--and in so doing manages nimbly
the feat (precious to post-Geertzian anthropology and new historicist
literary analysis alike) of drawing broadly consequential inferences
from elaborations of specific milieux.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Initially, Hegeman's favored procedure is to pair anthropologists with
intellectuals-at-large, in each instance strengthening the case for
metaphorical alignment (the two res had similar backgrounds and
ideas) with an appeal to metonymy (the two res were linked by the
Columbia-Village nexus). In chapter two, for example, she notes in
passing that Randolph Bourne was a student of Boas's colleague John
Dewey, while considering in some detail how opposition to American
intervention in World War One led both Boas and Bourne to their most
important contributions to the evolving discourse of culture. (For both,
American intolerance of German difference made imperative the defense,
if not the articulation, of a relativist cultural pluralism.) In three,
she shows how the problem of individual agency within cultural production
led both Van Wyck Brooks and Edward Sapir--who shared "the same general
social milieu as Boas and Bourne"--to powerful doubts about the very
possibility of an authentically valid American culture . And in four,
she argues that Ruth Benedict and Waldo Frank are worth reading together
not only because of Frank's journalistic connections to Benedict's friend
and mentor Sapir, but also because both turned to a "loose federalism" of
regional cultures "geographically remote from urban America" for help in
resolving the impasses that defeated Sapir and Brooks . Illuminating
as this kind of pairing may be, however, it can stand only so much
interpretive pressure before it becomes rigid, and Hegeman is alert to
that danger. Accordingly, she enriches the Boas-Bourne material with a
fresh take on Eliot, the Brooks-Sapir with a look at Alfred Kroeber's
notion of "the superorganic," the Benedict-Frank with readings of Jean
Toomer and Sherwood Anderson. She abandons the dyadic approach wholly
when it ceases to serve, putting Constance Rourke, Kenneth Burke,
Robert and Helen Lynd, Thomas Hart Benton, Nathanael West, and others
in suggestive array in chapter five, and visiting Benedict, Brooks,
Margaret Mead, Dwight Macdonald and James Agee in six.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One advantage of the New York focus is that it enables Hegeman to
avoid, very cleanly, one of the traps into which certain historicists
(Michaels especially) have been known to fall: that of making appeals to
zeitgeist or epistemic rupture unsupported by attention to the paths by
which ideas are transmitted and the conditions under which ideological
positions mature. It's not that she regards personal contact or shared
environments as the necessary foundation of comparison, as if absorption
of topics <I>en l'air</I> and undocumented acts of reading and listening
aren't the powerful forces they always are; on the contrary, her focal
pairs tend to be more distantly connected than other couples that she
might have treated at length. (Benedict and Frank, for example, shared
nothing like the bonds that linked Benedict to Mead and Sapir.) In its
particular way of attending to the Village-Columbia nexus, however,
her work answers a demand made by Raymond Williams--but forgotten by
some of Williams's less careful admirers--that individuals' experiences,
and particularly their experiences of large social forces, be considered
as factors in the generation of ideas. True, there are moments when
she turns inopportunely from intriguing conceptual problems to blander
biographical rationales. When she describes Brooks's tendency to resort
to binaries as "a fascinating example of a repetition compulsion," or
when (on slender evidence) she traces writers' worries about cultural
community to disappointment with the New York scene itself, I hear
the note of explanation-through-trauma that is one of contemporary
biography's least fortunate tendencies (74, 59, 91, 98). But such
moments are rare. More typical is her superb elucidation of how the
professionalizing of anthropology and literary criticism affected her
subjects' address to national culture, or her canny reading of Agee's
recourse to personal recollection in <I>Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men</I>--a fitting culmination to her exploration

<B></B>

of middle-class guilt's refraction through non-middle-class others in
writing of the Cold War and before.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another reason why biographical sympathies serve <I>Patterns for
America</I> so well is that they resonate with a theme that preoccupies
Hegeman's subjects: How is individual freedom to be reconciled with the
demand of social cohesion? This is, of course, the governing dilemma
of liberalism, and as she notes it has shadowed cultural prescription
at least since Arnold's recommendation that citizens transcend their
"ordinary selves" in favor of "best selves" joined by a cultural glue. Her
early chapters show illuminatingly how U.S. writers, confronting both the
contradictions of Arnold's "cheery mysticism" and the new world's apparent
poverty of tradition, sought to reframe the problem in distinctively
American terms . Brooks, for example, tried to imagine a fusion of
the spiritual yet desiccated "Puritan" element with that of the practical
but unprincipled "Pioneer," yet found in the very intransigence of this
binary (and its subsequent incarnations) a split within the middle-class
self that culture could never heal. Sapir, in Hegeman's account, came
to a similarly unhappy conclusion when he tried to apply his definition
of culture as the embodiment of "the national genius" to the case of the
United States . And in a provocative reading of Benedict's <I>Patterns
of Culture</I> <I>,</I> she argues that the anthropologist's much
discussed contrast between the "Apollonian" Zuni of New Mexico and the
"Dionysian" Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island may have less to do with the
difference between sobriety and ecstasy than with the tension between
communal and individual that subtended less veiled period imaginings of
the American utopia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benedict is the hinge of Hegeman's narrative, as her title might suggest,
because her thinking touches, on one side, intellectuals bounded by a
more or less Brooksian staging of the problem, and, on the other, a set
of mostly younger writers who turned to regionalism for relief from the
Arnoldian malady. This second group tried to reconcile diversity with
national genius by imagining a country of multiple coherent cultures among
which one, some, or none might be privileged as the genuine American
article; and it's when she turns to these formulations that she really
hits her stride. If the first part of <I>Patterns for America</I> is
often insightful, the second is frequently brilliant. Here, a sensitive
explication of Sherwood Anderson's <I>Poor White</I> illustrates how a
sentimentalized Midwest came to contain America's diversity in the double
sense of including it and expunging it; here, an analysis of restless
hands in Anderson and Nathanael West illustrates how "Anderson, once
held as the exemplar of a new, indigenous American modernist aesthetic,
becomes the source of a grotesque representation of the frustrated desires
of the middlebrow" (124, 156). Fine as these close readings are, however,
the greater strength of this part of the book lies in its ambitious
reconstruction of regionalism's role in the culture wars of the interwar
years. Working up from instances like Thomas Hart Benton's 1935 response
to Diego Rivera (in which Benton replaces Marxism's proletarian version of
"the people" with a middle-class and implicitly Midwestern "common man"
[142]), she presents an economical, yet extraordinarily powerful, overview
of how visions of difference based on region clashed with visions based on
class throughout the thirties. Nor is she less suggestive when she winds
up the thread of high regionalism's fate. Could the "deep anxiety about
cultural loss" felt by forties and fifties intellectuals, she wonders,
derive from a kind of spectacular demise of region itself? Might "the
increasing globalization of 'American culture'" not have "suggested
the increasing difficulty of locating a position for the intellectual
to inhabit that was critically exterior to the (global) social whole"
(170-1)?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be that no critical work ever fails to enact one or two of the
problems it describes, and <I>Patterns for America</I> does leave one
asking how closely its New York particular represented the American
general. The jacket copy promises a tracking of how "the term 'culture'
changed from being a technical term associated primarily with anthropology
into a term of popular usage," and this promise is handsomely fulfilled
in several ways. Hegeman shows concretely how the New York groups
disseminated their ideas through anthropological best-sellers, small
but influential

<B></B>

magazines, government-university partnerships, and other channels; she
also usefully spotlights some anti-New York, antihighbrow reactions,
notably <I>Time</I> magazine's promotion of Benton and Anderson as
regionalists defending sane middle-American representationalism from,
respectively, French abstraction and the literary "vagaries of the
Da-da school" . Still, I felt a twinge of doubt on encountering
the implication that a "widespread consensus over 'culture'" in the
thirties enveloped not only "writers, photographers, social crusaders,
[and] bureaucrats" but also many an average Joe and Jane, and found myself
wondering how culture was actually regarded by more pedestrian residents
of places that the New York groups made iconic of regionalism. What
were inhabitants of the real New Mexico, the real Ohio, the real Los
Angeles thinking ? And what was on the mind of Chicago, a place
that Hegeman shows to have been on New Yorkers' minds to a surprising
degree? How did Harriet Monroe--hardly an ordinary citizen, certainly,
but a Chicagoan in spite of her international connections--feel about
culture, regionalism, and identity?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The foregoing isn't a substantial complaint, only a question, and
I doubt that many readers will fault Hegeman for failing to cover
every last take on culture from the First World War to the Cold. The
name of Monroe, however, points to what some will find a more serious
absence following from the New York focus, that of extended attention
to the expatriate writing still regarded by many as the centerpiece of
American modernism. Except for Eliot (about whom more in moment), the
expates receive only passing mention here--references to Pound, Stein,
and H.D. are few--and even stay-at-home biggies like Stevens, Faulkner,
and Moore scarcely surface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 To this objection, Hegeman responds by stating plainly that modernism
 is for her "first and foremost a periodizing concept, characterized
 by a nexus of related historical, intellectual, technological, and
 aesthetic developments, rather than . . . a set of formal traits or
 styles," and by arguing that to hand modernism over wholly to "the
 cosmopolitan avant-gardes of a few European capitals" is to adopt a view
 that is "impoverished in its explanatory power" and is more rather than
 less open to charges of provincialism (19-21). She then offers a
 pr&eacute;cis of recent work on modernism as a historical phenomenon
 so crisply compact that one might recommend it as a primer for readers
 outside the field--just as one might hand <I>Patterns for America</I>
 as a whole to non-anthropologists interested in learning something
 about that discipline's history. Of course, none of this will satisfy
 those for whom modernism <I>is</I> a set of formal traits or styles,
 let alone those who take it to mean a specific canon of authors or
 works. (Even these, however, might grant Hegeman's claim to the extent
 that earlier chapters set the stage for her climactic reading of Cold
 War fabricators of modernism like Macdonald and Clement Greenberg.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For my money, the muting of expatriate modernism per se offers less
occasion for regret than does another omission, that of transatlantic
contexts for the American debates Hegeman examines. The book's opening
discussion of how "culture" sometimes overlaps with and sometimes opposes
"civilization" in writers like Bourne, Sapir, and Lewis Mumford is
useful, but it would have been more helpful still if it had engaged more
directly with Raymond Williams's work on the tension between these terms
in nineteenth-century British discourse, or Norbert Elias's rendering of
its inauguration under German Romanticism. (These genealogies would be
significant in any case, but they're all the more resonant here because,
like Hegeman, both Elias and Williams take very seriously the question
of historical actors' experience of social pressures.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 As just noted, also, the only American expatriate who receives
 substantial consideration is T. S. Eliot, but the treatment here fails
 to engage his most relevant polemic, <I>Notes towards the Definition
 of Culture</I> . Her early reading of "The Dry Salvages" 
 in relation to developments in anthropology is stimulating, as is her
 note on the spatialization of culture discernible in <I>After Strange
 Gods</I> . After this point, however, Eliot all but disappears
 from the radar, which is odd because <I>Notes</I> makes so many of the
 pluralist moves that Hegeman explores in other writers. True, Eliot's
 concern isn't the United States but the United Kingdom (which in his
 view should remain politically single but culturally multiple: English,
 Welsh, Scottish, Irish);

<B></B>

true also, the texts that she finds most salient in regionalism appeared
well before 1949. Yet 1949 isn't beyond the temporal scope of <I>Patterns
for America</I> as a whole, and it would surely have been illuminating
to put Eliot's later cultural federalism into dialogue with the turn
taken by postwar American critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And speaking of postwar American critics: If the light treatment given
Eliot's <I>Notes</I> is a little curious, downright strange is the absence
of explicit reference to Lionel Trilling's <I>Beyond Culture</I> ,
which speaks to Hegeman's concerns more immediately than any other product
of the <I>Partisan Review</I> milieu. In his preface to that collection,
Trilling not only worries about how far New York (and especially
Columbia) intellectuals may presume to speak for a larger society,
but also addresses this problem by way of the two meanings of "culture"
to which Hegeman recurs (in his rendering: "that complex of activities
which includes the practice of the arts and of certain intellectual
disciplines," and "a people's technology, its manners and customs,
its religious beliefs and organization, its systems of valuation").
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Moreover, the governing supposition of <I>Beyond Culture</I> is that
 "a primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual
 from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit
 him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In other words, Trilling here (as in other books like <I>The Liberal
 Imagination</I>) confronts both the problem of individual agency
 within culture <I>and</I> a problem of epistemological totality that,
 as we'll see in a moment, surfaces in the last pages of <I>Patterns
 for America.</I> Might it be that at some stage in the preparation of
 Hegeman's book, Trilling was its explicitly presiding genius? As things
 stand, he remains its (almost) silently presiding ghost.

II.
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One omission with which Hegeman can't be charged is a failure to
address contemporary battles over "culture." In her last chapter,
she applies her insights into the term's genealogy to the question of
its place and usage in the United States today, which is to say that
<I>Patterns for America,</I> again like Michaels's <I>Our America,</I>
is a reading of modernism and culture that has something significant to
say to readers with no interest in modernism as such. Confronted with an
infinite number of possible approaches to the question, Hegeman elects to
examine "arguments that have been made recently by both anthropologists
and literary scholars for the complete abandonment of 'culture' as a
critical term"--arguments that she would not represent as a "dominant,
or even an emergent, view among people invested in . . . things widely
thought of as 'cultural'"  but that do give some purchase on
inclinations and agendas underlying a range of debates on culture today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman's first test case is the anthropologist Virginia R. Dominguez's
assertion that because the term "culture" has its roots in a Eurocentric
elitism, its deployment in anthropology will always be tainted by
Eurocentrism and other hegemonic impositions of hierarchy. For Dominguez,
in other words, the "anthropological," horizontalizing sense of culture
hasn't canceled out, and never can cancel out, the "Arnoldian," vertical
vision that it complicated and partially displaced. She addresses this
line of argument--and a related one advanced by Johannes Fabian--briskly,
asking on what grounds deletion of the term from (anthropological)
use should be preferred to a retention that maintains an awareness of
the term's complex history. "[U]nless we are to assume that 'culture'
is somehow unique among words," she writes, "Fabian and Dominguez
are . . . offering a theory of language . . . in which terms somehow
inherently contain, or import, specific ideas, largely irrespective of
context and usage" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 She then turns to a similar recommendation issuing from a nearly opposite
 critical position, and dispatches it with similar efficiency. To Joel
 S. Kahn's claim that "culture" is rendered all but meaningless by
 the <I>distance</I> of the presiding anthropological sense from the
 Arnoldian origin, and his consequent

<B></B>

worry that abuse of "culture" perpetuates an impossible fantasy of
"escaping our own concepts and categories into a world of the other"
(202; Kahn's phrasing), Hegeman replies that informed retention of a term
that insistently recalls the anthropologist's "reflexive dilemma" will
likely be more productive for the field than attempts to end ambivalence
via dictional purgation (202-3).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegeman's final engagement is more extended and more complicated:
the opponent this time is Michaels himself, and the texts at issue,
<I>Our America</I> and an earlier distillation of its argument,
"Race into Culture: A Critical Genealogy of Cultural Identity." In
Hegeman's reading, Michaels aligns with Dominguez, Fabian, and Kahn in
advocating the eschewing of "culture," and speaks to Kahn especially
closely because the ground of this recommendation lies in a critique of
"race." Both Kahn and Michaels regard racial essentialism as at once
ontologically indefensible and political pernicious, and both link the
reification of race to that of culture. Whereas Kahn sees the two terms
as operating analogously ("the notion of <I>a</I> culture is formally
identical [to that of <I>a</I> race]" [203]), however, Michaels discerns
a tighter bond. For him, the "modern concept of culture is not . . . a
critique of racism; it is a form of racism," because exhortations to
maintain cultural integrity must of necessity be grounded in an appeal
to something outside the complex of beliefs and practices that constitute
a culture--and that something must be, or at least has been, race.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One curiosity of Hegeman's argument with Michaels is that it doesn't
unfold on the ground of the American modernism that is the common interest
of <I>Patterns for America</I> and <I>Our America</I>; nor does it dwell
heavily (though it does dwell some) on present-day popular understandings
of "culture" that Michaels strikingly ignores. In keeping with her
decision to approach matters via debates in anthropology, Hegeman instead
seeks to show how he gets caught up in a version of the reflexive dilemma:
chez Michaels, she asserts, "we cannot get outside of our culture any more
than we can our beliefs, because like our beliefs, our culture constrains
what can be thought--including what can be thought about 'culture'" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Under this view, Michaels joins other advocates of the jettisoning of
 "culture" who find the term so enveloping that it becomes meaningless,
 so total that it becomes "impotently descriptive" (Michaels's phrasing)
 rather than, presumably, potently prescriptive. To this, Hegeman rightly
 responds that impotence and description need not go together: "Giving
 descriptive content to 'what we do and believe' . . . would do the
 significant, and likely very controversial work of (among other things)
 defining the contours of a bounded population, of marking the difference
 between 'we' and 'they'" . The stage is then set for her closing
 recommendation, which is that the term "culture" be retained precisely
 because it tends to foreground messy exceptions to its own delimitations,
 and in so doing proves highly serviceable to attempts--utterly crucial
 "in this postmodern moment of destabilized totalities"--to mediate
 between "the local instance" and "the conceptual whole" (211-12).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This seems to me a profitable and (once again) sensible suggestion; what
I question, however, is whether Michaels quite says everything Hegeman
says he says. It seems to me worth taking time to consider further one
or two of his arguments, not because <I>Patterns for America</I> is to
be seen as laboring in the shadow of <I>Our America</I> (Hegeman's book
is significant enough to cast some shadows of its own), but because doing
so will give us added purchase on some of her conclusions--and, I think,
on the more general question of what relationships among modernism,
our own moment, and "culture" finally pertain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For starters, we might notice that in <I>Our America,</I> if not in
"Race into Culture," Michaels is bothered less by culture as such than
he is by cultural pluralism--or "cultural pluralism," which, he insists,
is an oxymoron. Why? Because

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
on the one hand, the pluralist claim that our practices are justified
only because they are better for us requires us to be able to say who
we are independent of those practices and so requires us to produce our
racial identity. But, on the other hand, the cultural claim denies the
relevance of race and so leaves us unable to appeal to facts about who
we are as justifications for what we do. . . . Cultural pluralism is
thus committed in principle to

<B></B>

identity essentialism, which is to say that in cultural pluralism,
culture does not constitute identity, it reflects or, more precisely,
expresses it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This claim may sound strange extracted here, but it sounds less so
when read as a summary of positions elsewhere developed a little more
patiently. Phrased more simply, the claim is that cultural pluralists
believe in the preservation of multiple cultures on the ground that those
cultures belong to or with certain people, quite apart from any other
value they may have; this is in contrast to the view that some cultures or
races are worth defending because they're better than others, or even good
where others are bad (as in turn-of-the-century white supremacism, which
he contrasts to the nativist pluralism of 1920s American writing). While
cultural pluralism may be less <I>recognizably</I> racist than this other
view, it's not (according to Michaels) actually less so. Each is premised
on a reification and indeed a validation of race as the basis of praxis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There's a certain logical rigor in Michaels's argument, undoubtedly, and
if we keep that argument in mind we'll be sure to recognize as racist
the insistence that each person must practice--or as we might say more
fashionably, "perform"--"her" culture and no other because it's "hers"
according to ancestry or biology. Yet how many "pluralists" in this
country today actually hold such a view? Certainly, many people believe
something of the kind casually much of the time, perhaps less casually
at times when their own children's or neighbors' ways of living are
at issue. Certainly, too, there are self-proclaimed racists who would
readily endorse such a view of cultural obligation, though they might
also acknowledge that the cool dictates of culture finally have nothing,
for them, on the warm satisfactions of blood. And certainly, again,
there are those--Christopher Clausen in last year's <I>Faded Mosaic:
The Emergence of Post-Cultural America,</I> for example--who refashion
for postmodern times the lament of Bourne, Eliot, and others that true
cultural diversity has been one of modernity's victims, the old life
ways of distinctive ethnic groups having succumbed to homogenizing forces
like advertising and television.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Yet it's quite clear that the first two kinds of people are not well
 characterized as "pluralists." And it remains doubtful that the third,
 even if pluralist in Michaels's terms, would endorse the proposition that
 cultural diversity is to be preserved because people should practice
 what their identity bids them, rather than for the sake of continuity
 with the past or diversity pure and simple.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nor, it must be added, would any of these positions be identified with
the contemporary political left. This last point isn't pertinent to
the absolute logic of Michaels's argument, of course, but it's highly
relevant to the status of <I>Our America</I> as an intervention in
mid-1990s debates, because the book draws much of its air of controversy
from the impression that it aims to expose ugly truths about leftists,
not rightists. Actual left-based agendas pertaining to culture, however,
are rarely driven by a belief in the metaphysical truth of the proposition
that people ought to be true to what they ancestrally are (though, to
be fair, they're often supported by an assumption that people should
be <I>allowed</I> to be true to what they believe themselves to be,
and even--in some cases--that people have a right to possess what
they believe to have belonged to their ancestors). A more important
motivation for left cultural pluralism is a certain custodial impulse,
which may include a commitment to the preservation and dissemination
of historical knowledge as well as the kind of general anxiety about
things disappearing that impels some environmentalists; another motive
is the conviction (shared by conservatives like Clausen) that cultural
diversity is valuable simply because it contributes to life's plentitude.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There's also a more evidently political and progressive reason to affirm
"culture" as a sanction for certain ideas and practices, which is that
concretely injurious hostility to persons believed to belong to other
groups is frequently rooted in an antipathy to foreign behaviors, styles,
and beliefs--to elements, in other words, that we would unhesitatingly
call cultural. This position doesn't require a belief in the reality
of race, or even a belief that particular cultural forms need to be
attached to particular persons. What it does require is a belief that
xenophobia or hostility to difference has been harmful, and that it
can be countered in large or small ways by certain affirmations of,
or exposures to, practices that could otherwise seem threatening in their

<B></B>

strangeness. Michaels performs an inestimably valuable service in
reminding us that pluralist initiatives, including multicultural events
and curricula, may abet rather than diminish racism insofar as they
perpetuate the reification of race and the essentializing of identity. The
argument that such initiatives are themselves intrinsically racist,
however, is at once overingenious and misleading. It might hold true in
a world utterly free of the unreason of history, or rather free of the
persistence of unreason, but it's manifestly false in the world we have,
where "mistakes" (Michaels's word) like race continue to exert powerful
effects on people's lives.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some proponents of this line, certainly, might join with nostalgics like
Clausen to decry the degradation of the term "culture" implicit in the
foregoing account, especially as it touches on multiculturalism. If
the Left proposes a future in which we (where "we" might mean, say,
all Americans) come to think of ourselves as one rather than many,
but still occasionally trot out some old-country finery or traditional
"ethnic" dish by way of nodding to our then-divided ancestors, what
has happened to authentic culture? Is what's proffered here not rather
an Epcot Center gone global--all ersatz and toothless, and finally
not culture at all? Whether such forays (however fraudulent) wouldn't
count as elements in a new culture (however attractive or loathsome)
is, of course, an open question: the central claim of Clausen's book is
that such a condition can't count as culture, which is why the United
States in the year 2000 is already, in his calculatingly inflated phrase,
"post-cultural." But even if we were to agree that this is a fair picture
of multiculturalist aspirations <I>and</I> that it describes something
so inauthentic that it ceases to be culture, we might ask why anyone
advancing <I>Michaels</I>'s argument would care to stake so much on
authenticity. It would be strange, after all, to fault pluralists for
using culture to support their covertly racist attachment to purity
of identity only to fault them for inauthenticity if they respond,
"But culture doesn't have to be attached to identity so inflexibly." To
the degree that Michaels himself takes this line, then, he does finally
oppose "culture" as well as pluralism, for in such terms culture can
only serve racist ends or be inauthentic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of this should strike us as a problem not least because, as Hegeman
reminds us, there are many currently prevalent uses of "culture" that
attach to things other than race, including things utterly removed from
"identity" in any remotely encompassing sense. We have not only "gay
culture," which has been deeply and agonizingly bound up with identity
questions, but also "corporate culture," "the culture of death," and
locutions like "the culture of my high school," which by and large have
not. Michaels entirely refrains from discussing these deployments in
<I>Our America,</I> but what they name for contemporary Americans are
sets of beliefs and practices characteristic of groups that may not
always--and in some cases can absolutely never--subsume one wholly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Authenticity, here, is no longer tethered to essence; one may feel
 oneself truly a part of corporate culture without believing that one
 is eternally, absolutely, or even willingly corporate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be that adherents of Michaels's line would find these uses of
"culture" illegitimate; the interesting question is what could make them
so, apart from the pointlessly doctrinaire claim that culture must always
be racial culture. The interesting answer, surely, is that what makes them
seem inauthentic is their very rapprochement with partialness. From such
a perspective, what makes a "culture" of this sort not a real culture is
precisely its failure to meet one of the few criteria on which Arnold and
the anthropologists agreed: the criterion of totality, which requires
that a culture entail a whole way of being. Hegeman's observation that
Michaels "smuggles in" totality when querying culture is therefore
apposite, though the notion of totality that subtends his argument
may not be exactly the one that she discerns. When Michaels refers to
culture as "what we do and believe," he's not, as far as I can tell,
evoking the epistemological quandary of how one might get outside one's
given conceptual universe in order to talk about that universe. Rather,
he's referring to the whole set of beliefs and practices believed to
accompany a racial identity, where the presumption is that a person will
normally be limited to one identity only.

But fewer and fewer Americans, it seems, believe themselves wholly
embedded in a single identity or a single culture (apart from "American"
identity and culture), and almost none, probably, imagine all other
Americans to be so installed. Charles Altieri alludes to this aspect
of contemporary understandings in his contribution to a 1996 forum on
<I>Our America</I> in this journal, remarking that

How many Americans, conservative, moderate, or radical, would insist that
immersion in "corporate culture" utterly precludes involvement in, say,
"West Indian culture" or "lesbian culture"? A person might, after all,
be a West Indian in-house counsel who shares sex and domesticity with
another woman; a person might even try to participate in or partake
of one or more of these cultures <I>without</I> identifying herself
(or himself) as West Indian, corporate, or lesbian. Conservatives may
cringe, theorists of performance may rejoice, but the issue here is not
whether conceptions of "culture" unhinged from encompassing identity are
desirable or undesirable. The point is that such conceptions are in play
among contemporary Americans whether one likes it or not. Michaels is
certainly correct if he limits himself to the claim that many Americans
still do and believe certain things on the grounds that these things
belong to their "own" cultures. But he's clearly wrong to imply that
American attitudes toward cultural life, cultural diversity, and cultural
preservation remain circumscribed, or even dominated, by the belief that
one <I>must</I> immerse oneself in one's own culture and nobody else's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Hegeman suggests (but might to good effect have brought out more
strongly), then, the oscillation of "culture" between wholeness
and partialness in contemporary debates results not just from
disciplinary uncertainties or scholarly compunction, but from a change
in extra-academic understanding that may retain racism of various kinds,
but notably eases out the particular strain of racism that occupies
Michaels. One of the oddities, not to say ironies, of Michaels's book
is that it meticulously charts transformations in the story of "race"
and "culture" occurring between the 1890s and the 1920s, yet implies
that <I>since</I> the twenties nothing much has altered. In this
respect, as in a number of others, <I>Patterns for America</I> is the
far superior study of modernism and culture. For not only does Hegeman
extend her genealogy of "culture" farther into the century and attend to
present-day usages; she also takes care to think about the mechanisms
by which certain writers got their beliefs into wide circulation,
instead of tacitly mapping the agenda of a historically limited group
(early-century pluralists or "progressive racists") on to the whole
period of that group's flourishing <I>and</I> on to an ill-defined,
though implicitly vast, present-day American imaginary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But at least one more objection to the retention of "culture" remains. For
mightn't it be that the best argument for retiring "culture" lies,
precisely, in its recent appropriation by the partial? Couldn't it
be argued that, pace Hegeman's tribute to terms with vexed histories,
"culture" now promotes a peculiarly harmful confusion because it has
come to designate exactly that which both the anthropological and the
Arnoldian-Eliotic usages meant to exclude? Couldn't it be claimed that
no one's interests--left, center, or right--are served by a term whose
polar inversion of its earlier sense promotes the mistaking of partial
"culture" for total culture (or partial "cultures" for total cultures)?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps--except that "culture" has never <I>universally</I> been thought
to refer to something total, nor would it be wholly amiss to describe
the history of "culture" as a series of attempts to prove encompassing
what many imagine to be restricted in scope. We might recall, here,
that Arnold frames his <I>Culture and Anarchy</I>  as a response
to those who would dismiss "culture" as "a smattering of Greek and Latin
. . . begotten by nothing so intellectual as curiosity . . .

<B></B>

[and] valued either out of sheer vanity and ignorance, or else as an
engine of social and class distinction, separating its holder, like
a badge or title, from other people who have not got it." Certainly,
Arnold wanted to convince his readers that "no serious man would call
this <I>culture,</I>" and that authentic culture required a continuous and
ever-ramifying devotion to the pursuit of perfection; but he acknowledged
at the outset that there were (unserious) souls who would mistake it
for a detachable set of attainments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What has counted for many as both the originary and the defining use
 of "culture" in Anglo-American discourse, that is to say, begins with
 an admission that the term is a contested one, its associations with
 wholeness comprised by another usage affiliated with the contingent
 and the partial.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nor has culture ever been securely total on the anthropological side. Here
we might call up Hegeman on how an aspect of nineteenth-century "salvage
ethnography" persisted in anthropology well after 1900:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Salvage" had become . . . a nostalgic operation, recording ways of life
that were seen to be dying out in the face of encroaching assimilation and
modernization. As James Clifford has pointed out, the very structure of
the classic ethnography is based on this newer idea of salvage, which
both laments the inevitable loss of the other's 'culture' and then
reconstructs it as text." [34]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virtually from its inception, anthropology has been haunted by the worry
that once a group makes contact with modernity, its composite of beliefs
and practices may somehow cease to count as its authentic life way--the
fear that anything a modern person could actually lay his hands on would
fail to qualify as "culture," rigorously speaking. And as many moments
in the rest of Hegeman's book elegantly testify, it was but a small
step from this anxiety to the thought that modern societies might be as
incapable of producing a culture in the purest anthropological sense as
they were of generating full culture in the Arnoldian. In other words,
if "culture" was to denominate anything experienceable by modern people,
limits on the term's use might have to be relaxed sufficiently to admit
the partial after all.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Hegeman's modernists, as we've seen, that concession to partialness
didn't come easy: even regionalism, which might at first look like
an embrace of diversity, seems on closer inspection to be fueled by a
sort of melodrama of synecdoche. (Which region, complete in itself, will
stand for America as a unified whole? Which complex of traits will define
the region?) Yet it does seem worthwhile to ask whether the mistrust of
partialness in this period was as unrelieved as her survey implies. What
happens to the picture, we might ask, if we add to the mix a re like
Mead? At the end of <I>Coming of Age in Samoa</I> , after all,
Mead advises modern Americans to learn from Samoan educational practice
<I>not</I> in order to attain a unified culture, but in order to prepare
children for existence in a <I>dis</I>unified one whose wealth of options
may be admired as soon as regretted. "[W]hen no one group claims ethical
sanction for its customs, and each group welcomes to its midst only those
who are temperamentally fitted for membership," she concludes grandly,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
then we shall have realised the high point of individual choice and
universal toleration which a heterogeneous culture and a heterogeneous
culture alone can attain. Samoa knows but one way of life and teaches
it to her children. Will we, who have the knowledge of many ways, leave
our children free to choose among them?

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, Mead continues to refer to "our" culture in the singular,
but it's quite clear that if a yearning for lost unity lingers at all
here, it's balanced by a sense that such wholeness can't--and very likely
shouldn't--be the destiny of modern people. The knowledge of many ways
seems at least as promising a social formula as the limitation to one.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or suppose we consider the literature of canonical high modernism,
which depends for many of its effects on an encounter between a part
of life holding intense significance and a great remainder whose very
vacuousness, ironically, makes possible the intensity of the other.

<B></B>

The neatest example here may come from Virginia Woolf, whose "moments of
being" align closely with the cultural productions that count for her as
worthwhile; but if we want to stick with Americans we need only turn to
Eliot, who in spite of his critical invocations of the Arnoldian whole
produced a poetry that depended--more radically than almost anything in
nineteenth-century writing--upon a dialectic of the banal and the vital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 And even were we to limit ourselves to nonexpatriate Americans, in
 deference to the parameters of Hegeman's and Michaels's studies, we
 wouldn't have to go too far to find the same structure at work. Consider,
 as example, the re of Stevens, the lawyer-by-day / poet-by-night
 whose poetics locates value in "imagination" but requires also an
 antithetical term ("reality") for imagination to play upon and, in so
 doing, secondarily hallow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, high modernists didn't always name the meaning-bearing part of
life "culture." But it's important to see that in both their visions and
Mead's, the partialness associated with divided experience has a positive
aspect with immediate implications for cultural thinking. In both, the
intensity or plenitude deriving from meaning's localization makes it at
least possible to embrace (rather than lament) the difference between a
less happy but existentially richer "us" and a primitive "them" whose
culture remains unified and whole. It's understandable that modernist
scholarship has had more to say about the urge to go primitive than
about the urge to refrain; the latter is harder to detect, and where
construed as a claim of modern superiority could make one's chosen
authors look more ethnocentric than they otherwise would. Yet it would
surely be odd for us to imagine that the word "culture" could signify
both a modern person's acquaintance with arts and ideas (descendant of
Arnold's smattering of Greek and Latin) and the total set of practices
of a non-modern tribe <I>without</I> instilling some sense of parity
between a partialness proper to "us" and a wholeness proper to "them."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is to say, clearly, that one intriguing question left unexplored
by Hegeman concerns the ways in which modernism was inflected by the
assumed <I>a</I>symmetry between anthropological others and Arnoldian
selves--an aymmetry that may have diminished, and undoubtedly complicated,
the pathos of lost totality. Is it also to say, however, that in trying
to solve the dilemma of culture by embracing partialness more openly and
less guiltily, recent decades have only extended or brought to light
processes already at work in modernism? Not quite. For the innovation
of the later part of the century, in the U. S. at least, has not only
been to lower the temperature of remorse; it has also been to join
modernism's relatively abstract embrace of division in modern life to
sets of practices and beliefs associated with concretely nameable groups,
in this sense making the problem of "our" culture an anthropological
as well as an Arnoldian matter after all. For more and more Americans,
as we've already observed, it's not only that culture can be (coherent)
culture without being encompassing, but also that <I>a</I> culture can be
a (coherent) culture without constituting a totality. To say that recent
decades have moved to validate the partial along both "anthropological"
and "Arnoldian" lines, <I>and</I> made this validation the basis of a
new integration of the two, is in a way to say no more than that "my
culture" means less and less "the culture to which I belong," more and
more "a culture that belongs to me."

Hegeman's dismissal may be a little <I>too</I> brisk, inasmuch as it
passes over a key piece of Dominguez's argument. This is the point
that governments around the world invoke a quasi-Arnoldian sense of
"culture" in setting policies whose practical results (not to say
authentic motives) are worthy of scrutiny. For Dominguez, the problem
may be less the Eurocentrism of "culture" per se than the ways culture
has been "invoked to explain (justify?) continuing social, economic,
and political inequalities" . Thus Hegeman's comments on the place of
"culture" within the discourse of anthropology offer needed perspective
on Dominguez's claim that "the very notion of a cultural policy does
not allow the rebellious, populist, holistic Boasian sense of culture
to be employed," but they don't fully answer her questions about what
happens when people who contest the validation of European elements or
qualities nonetheless buy into "the elite European ideas that there is
such a thing as culture and that it is through one's culture that one's
value is judged" (24, 36). "Invoking Culture: The Messy Side of 'Cultural

Indeed the most disheartening aspect of Michaels's response to his critics
has been his resistance to the idea that the mistake of race might have
to be countered, in the world that we do have, by anything more than a
simple pointing to the fact of its mistakenness. The summer 1994 issue
of <I>Critical Inquiry</I> contains a critique of "Race into Culture"
in which Avery Gordon and Christopher Newfield argue that

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
civil rights era common sense . . . promotes discussion of racism in
all of its forms, particularly in its friendlier modern ones, like
institutional racism. It asks for increased use of the category of race
not because race is a biological fact or even because it defines one's
intrinsic personal or cultural identity but because it is one of the most
important principles by which U. S. social relations are organized. [740]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In their view, Michaels's essay provides a philosophical rationale for
an ascendant liberal racism that concentrates on the pure erroneousness
of race rather than on the consequences of that error's persistence;
this kinder, subtler form of racism, they write, takes comfort in the
proposition that "racism does not make people talk about race; talk
about race sustains racism." <I>Critical Inquiry</I> 20 (summer 1994):
739. Perloff makes a related point, commenting on Michaels's failure to
see that "[i]n an imperfect world, as the history of our brutal century
has taught us, identity is largely a question of how others perceive us"
.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both of these critiques are followed by responses from Michaels that,
while thoughtful enough on some fronts, strikingly evade the problem
at issue here. Michaels suggests that Perloff's remark encodes a strong
essentialist claim about the truth of identity, but this seems willful
obtuseness on his part, since it's clear in context that Perloff is
talking about how others' perceptions of what we are impinge on the lives
we lead, no matter whether these perceptions are true or false. Tellingly,
not to say astonishingly, he addresses Nazi persecution, her relevant
example, by asserting that we would have no grounds "for criticizing the
Nazis if we didn't think that their perceptions of Jewish identity were
<I>mistaken,</I>" as though brutality alone doesn't provide sufficient
matter for rebuke ("Response,"  3 [September
1996]: 122). Replying to Gordon and Newfield, meanwhile, Michaels rightly
defends reason as a principle of argument, but once again circumvents
the crucial point that we don't live in a world in which all parties
exercise reason all the time. Criticizing "social" recuperations of race,
he works several pages of analysis toward a culminating contention that
Gordon and Newfield "are obviously right: U. S. social relations have
been and continue to be organized in part by race. My point is that this
organization is the consequence of a mistake; and that antiessentialist
defenses of race amount to nothing more than new ways of making the
mistake" ("The No-Drop Rule," <I>Critical Inquiry</I> 20 [summer 1994]:
769). Yet this both restates Michaels's earlier position and ignores
Gordon and Newfield's major contention, which is not that race should
be defended as an abstractly significant essence, but that it should
continue to be discussed as a historically consequential category.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT13" HREF="#REF13">13</A>.
In his  response, however, Michaels summarizes
his thesis by claiming "that any notion of cultural identity that goes
beyond the description of our actual beliefs and practices must rely on
race (<I>or something equivalent, say, sex</I>) in order to determine
which culture is actually ours (121, emphasis added).

Gretta Cousins's memoirs give a disconcerting account of her
honeymoon. She confesses how she found "bigness, strangeness, newness"
and even "virility" from Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's best-selling
introduction to theosophy, <I>The Secret Doctrine</I>, rather than from
a more conventional source. As though anticipating readerly raised
eyebrows at this substitution of that most fashionable of Edwardian
religious faiths for more usual nuptial pleasures, Gretta explained how
"providential" it was that spiritual matters preoccupied her during
a time of crisis. She grew "white and thin" during her first year of
marriage, not, as friends suspected, on account of her vegetarianism,
but rather due to "problems of adjustment to the revelation that marriage
had brought me as to the physical basis of sex":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On June 15th 1904, and at several other occasions during that significant
month, James Joyce stayed with Gretta Cousins and her husband James,
interspersing evenings with them with his courtship of Nora Barnacle. The
couple were established friends of Joyce, Gretta a talented pianist and
graduate of the Royal university and James a poet and playwright active
in the Literary Revival. To Gretta, Joyce was "a favourite of mine though
he was reputed to be a 'bad boy,'" and she "delighted in his lovely tenor
voice especially when I accompanied some of his Irish songs with nobody
but ourselves to hear in our little drawing room" (<I>WTT</I>, 106). The
affection was only partly reciprocated. Joyce was unable to stomach the
couple's proselytising of theosophy, chastity, and vegetarianism and fled,
grumbling of indigestion resulting from "a typhoid turnip."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 However, Joyce's discontent with the Cousins was grounded in more
 than culinary differences. Gretta Cousins's revulsion from "certain of
 the techniques of nature concerned with sex" exemplifed a theosophical
 somatophobia viewed with predictable ridicule and suspicion by the young
 Joyce, a self-proclaimed sexual radical. "Scylla and Charybdis," the
 ninth episode of <I>Ulysses</I>, performs a deeply subversive assault
 upon these sexual ideologies. "Scylla" assembles before Stephen a
 captive audience of Dublin theosophists, yet the chapter also groans
 with innuendo and sexual excess. This essay will explore this tension,
 documenting how Joyce discloses the fault lines permeating theosophy's
 celebration of chastity through a network of intertextual references
 which recover a buried, latent sexuality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Theosophy was in tune with contemporary social purity campaigns to impose
a single moral standard of sexual continence and self-restraint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Converts were implored to "obtain the power to control their desires,"
 to resist the surrender of "the divine nature to the animal nature":
 celibacy was recommended as having "superior advantages for meditation
 and study," whilst "marital continence" permitted "the union of the
 male spirit with the female soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Disciples, known as "chelas," were expected to remain celibate whilst
 seeking the path to enlightenment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Many theosophists were also dedicated social purists. For Charlotte
 Despard, the pioneering purity feminist Josephine Butler introduced
 "the close connection between the women's movement and the spiritual
 awakening which marked the closing decades of the last century."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Helena Blavatsky's companion Isabel Cooper-Oakley was a prominent
 campaigner for the Social Purity Alliance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 W. T. Stead, whose "Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon" articles exposing
 child prostitution in London had initiated and funded the National
 Vigilance Association, was another celebrity convert.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The Theosophical Society frequently published material which more
 commonly issued from social purity presses. Two theosophy pamphlets
 marketed as "of special interest to women" were Lucy Re-Bartlett's
 <I>Sex and Sanctity</I>, which recommended less of the former and more
 of the latter, and Edith Ward's <I>The Vital Question: An Address on
 Social Purity</I>, a millennial polemic against "marital incontinence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 This dialogue between theosophy and social purity is particularly
 significant for Joyce, since social purity had failed to achieve the

<B></B>

success in Ireland that it enjoyed in Britain. Irish social purity groups
such as the Dublin White Cross Vigilance Association were mistrusted
by Catholic nationalists as Protestant proselytising organisations,
a mistrust encouraged by social purity's enthusiastic Unionism and
imperialist agenda.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 However, theosophy was an important aspect of the Irish Literary
 Revival. John Eglinton asserted that the Celtic Revival was precipitated
 by "the ferment caused in the minds of a group of young men by the
 early activities of the Theosophy Movement in Dublin," and according
 to him W. B. Yeats once declared: "Theosophy has done more for Irish
 literature in three years than Trinity College in its three centuries."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Theosophy was thus a conduit for social purity ideology into an Ireland
 sympathetic to its sexual politics, yet suspicious of its political
 affiliations.

The Dublin Hermetist Society was founded by Yeats and George Russell
in 1886.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Hermetists included Revivalist poets James Cousins and Susan Mitchell,
 the journalist Charles Johnstone, the publisher George Roberts and
 Harry Norman, editor of <I>The Irish Homestead</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Many were Joyce's friends or mentors, and, initially caught up in the
 enthusiasm, Joyce acquired one of theosophy's key texts, Henry Olcott's
 <I>A Buddhist Catechism,</I> which he signed "J. A. Joyce, May 7, 1901."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consequently, as Ralph Jenkins notes, Joyce's "knowledge of theosophical
 doctrines is far greater than any commentator has previously pointed
 out."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 This knowledge was extended with later purchases of Annie Besant's
 <I>Une Introduction &agrave; la Th&eacute;osophie</I> and <I>The Path
 of Discipleship</I>, and comes into play in "Scylla," where Stephen
 finally responds to O'Molloy's question.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Stephen's Shakespeare theory has long been discredited as contradictory,
 irrelevant, historically inaccurate, a mere theatrical facade and
 of little literary value, readings all pre-empted by Stephen's own
 declaration that he does not believe in it himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Desmond McCarthy offers one way out of the puzzle, noting how trying
 to discern Shakespeare's personality from the paucity of information
 about him which remains is "like looking at a very dark glazed picture
 in the National Portrait Gallery: at first you see nothing, then you
 begin to recognise features, then you realise that they are your own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Rather than reflecting himself, however, the darkened glass of
 Stephen's Shakespeare portrait ostentatiously holds the mirror up to
 his listeners. As Len Platt notes, Stephen's remark "khaki Hamlets
 don't hesitate to shoot" and his reference to Swinburne's infamous
 defence of the British concentration camps during the Boer War together
 introduce this allegorising drive, as Stephen's Shakespeare is soiled
 by an imperial complicity his Ascendancy listeners defensively disavow
 (<I>U</I>, 9:133).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The allegory is abruptly personalised with "Elizabethan London lay as
 far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin" (<I>U</I>,
 9:149-50). "Virgin Dublin" is political provocation

<B></B>

comparable to "khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot," since again
Stephen uses the supposedly safe domain of literary criticism to mask
a more loaded critique of the contemporary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's pointed parallel between Shakespeare's Stratford and "virgin
Dublin" thus hits below the belt, announcing the focus of his critique to
be the occluded and privatized domain of sex. Individual recollections
of the Dublin Hermetists indicate how earnestly "the sex question"
was pondered:

In those early days we unmarried ones all hoped to become Chelas
and expected to remain celibate, and were rather shocked to hear of
Charles Johnstone's marriage, even to a niece of Madame Blavatsky! The
urges of sex, natural to youngsters in their twenties, were hardly
ever spoken of, except in the disguise of "Karma," and were sternly
suppressed. [<I>MAE</I>, 17]

George Russell found theosophical conversion an escape from adolescent
"desires of body and heart with which we so soon learn to taint our youth"
(<I>MAE</I>, 12). The predictable serpent was only vanquished when "I
became aware of a mysterious life quickening within my life, carrying
with it unsated desires, base and august, and as I divined it, myriads
of memories and secret wisdom" (<I>MAE</I>, 13). The monthly journal
<I>The Irish Theosophist</I> was similarly voluble. Charles Johnstone
inveighed against "man's animal part," elaborating on the many ways in
which "lust is but a disappointment, to be overcome."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Russell concurred, arguing that "the lower part of man, the body and
 its attachments, be conquered and purified."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 An unsigned article on "The Sex Problem" similarly asked "why cannot
 love be noble?" since "the soul is sexless and passionless."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 These individual reminiscences indicate how "virgin Dublin" was part
 of an international theosophical insistence upon asexuality. Celibacy
 was a condition of enlightenment, and "chelas" were urged to live in
 quasi-monastic communes like that at Ely Place. Blavatsky shared her
 London home with several prominent theosophists, and conspicuously
 led by example, responding to allegations of bigamy and illegitimate
 children with the characteristically bizarre claim that "I could never
 have connection with any man because I am lacking something and the
 place is filled up with some crooked cucumber."

 Annie Besant was only admitted into the movement on recanting her
 notorious teachings on contraception. She destroyed unsold copies
 of <I>The Law of Population</I>, writing <I>Theosophy and the Law of

 since "the sexual instinct that man has in common with the brute is
 the most fruitful source of human misery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen pointedly segregates the sexes, listing the men--Daniel
Dunlop, editor of <I>The Irish Theosophist</I>, William Quan Judge,
the Irish-American co-founder of the Theosophical Society, A.E., Koot
Hoomi, the Tibetan "master" or "mahatma" who supposedly precipitated
spirit-messages to Blavatsky--before the women, Blavatsky and Isabel
Cooper-Oakley. This gender segregation is summarized with "brotherhood
of the great white lodge," the association of benign Masters who watched
over the faithful from a higher spiritual plane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Stephen mentally maps out an ideologically loaded modulation of the
 "family of man" metaphor. Theosophy's ideal of "Universal Brotherhood"
 reassessed the family of man not as a reproductive unit, but as the
 terminal stage of biological and social development. By displacing
 "allfather, the heavenly man" with "brothers of the great white lodge,"
 Stephen draws attention to how theosophical egalitarianism censored the
 dangerous dynamism of sexual reproduction from a familiar metaphor. The
 process of this displacement is emphasized with "Christ with the
 bridesister," where Stephen linguistically demarcates the point of
 transformation, as "bride" mutates into chaste "sister." As Stephen
 suggests, the sibling relationship offered theosophists a safely celibate
 paradigm for the containment of potentially transgressive desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen builds up, however, to an imagined scenario which provocatively
retrieves the fissures implicit in theosophy's version of siblinghood. He
recalls Madame Blavatsky's insistence that her "elemental" or ghost
would appear to her followers after her death, and Isabel Cooper-Oakley's
much-publicised claim to have been so visited. While Blavatsky is "our
very illustrious sister," she is also a perverse sexual exhibitionist,
flaunting her "elemental" to her friend, and Stephen's pun on "elemental"
/ "genital" here transforms sisterhood into a predictable dirty joke,
disclosing a repressed lesbian longing behind the celibate facade. Stephen
suggests that theosophy's conspicuous disdain for heterosexuality or
"straight sex" in favour of an asexual sibling bond in fact masks
a sexuality that contemporary standards would have judged perverted
or corrupt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 It is therefore significant that Stephen's internal monologue is
 induced by George Russell's theory that "art has to reveal to us ideas,
 formless spiritual essences" (<I>U</I>, 9: 48-9). Stephen notes
 how Russell's aesthetics stem from his theosophy and retaliates by
 placing that connection under scrutiny. Russell "impatiently" objects
 to Stephen's Shakespeare theory with "all this prying into the family
 life of a great man" (<I>U</I>, 9:181). His objection is revealingly
 defensive, since Stephen's unfolding of "the brother-motive" radically
 challenges theosophy's view of brotherhood as egalitarian and asexual
 (<I>U</I>, 9:956). If theosophy presented brotherhood as a benignly
 "spiritualized" alternative

<B></B>

to the disruptive dynamism of sexuality, then Stephen reappraises
the relationship, building upon his insinuation about Blavatsky and
Cooper-Oakley to present the sibling bond not as an alternative to
sex, but as a bizarre perversion of it. His theory that Ann Hathaway's
"misconduct with the brothers" so obsessed Shakespeare that "the theme
of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in
one is what the poor is not, always with him" disconcertingly sexualises
fraternity (<I>U</I>, 9:963, 998). Stephen's detection of the brothers'
names in <I>Richard III</I> and <I>King Lear</I>, together with his
reading of <I>Hamlet</I> as an autobiographical account of sexual
rivalry between brothers, locks the Shakespeare siblings into a stifling
homosocial bond, where sexuality is not directed towards the outside
world, but is instead turned inwards, mediated through Ann Hathaway and
thereby towards each other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This provocative portrait of brotherhood as sexual claustrophobia is
intensified with the spectre of incest. While Stephen's reference to
"a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world,
stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its
breach" alludes to incestuous acts between fathers and sons, the question
of homosexual desire within the family it raises contributes towards
Stephen's investigation of another form of "bodily shame" (<I>U</I>, 9:
850-2). Stephen's "love that dare not speak its name" (<I>U</I>,
9: 659) is incest between brothers, a taboo desire which Stephen archly
presents as barely contained through the brothers' sexual sharing of Ann
Hathaway. This development of the incest theme is evident in Stephen's
initial insistence on the relationship between male members of a family
as one of jealousy, fear and revulsion: "the images of other males of his
blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to
foretell or to repeat himself" (<I>U</I>, 9:433-5). However, Stephen
soon revises this vision of repulsion into one of ambivalent desire: one
of the selves Stephen insists we encounter as "we walk through ourselves"
is "brothers-in-love" (<I>U</I>, 9:1046). The ambiguous re of the
brother-in-love collapses the distinction between the homosocial and
the homosexual, implying how a brother having sex with a brother's wife
is thereby engaging in indirect incest. These hints of this shocking
sexual taboo are confirmed and compounded, as Susan Sutliff Brown has
fascinatingly shown, by Joyce's perplexing concealment of the names of
his own brothers within <I>Ulysses</I>. Following the autobiographical
invitation extended in "Scylla" to search for the names of <I>Joyce's</I> three brothers George, Charles, and Stanislaus, Brown notes that all
appear in "sexually explicit or suggestive connection with either Stephen
or Bloom or both." Thus, George appears in "Scylla" and elsewhere as
"Georgina Johnson," or Stephen's favourite prostitute, Charles appears
as "Charles Alberta Marsh," the voyeur who contemplates sex with the
"bisexually abnormal" Bloom in "Circe," while a Madame Stanislaus is
coupled with the cross-dressing Gerald, the performer who Bloom claims
"converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was a female impersonator
in the High School Play."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 These disconcerting visions of the Joyce brothers in real or fantasised
 sexual encounters with Joyce's fictional counterparts thus ironically
 substantiate Stephen's Shakespeare theory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ann Hathaway's "misconduct with the brothers" thus boldly challenges
theosophy's ideological attachment to brotherhood as safely celibate. The
impact of Stephen's insinuations

<B></B>

is indicated when Stephen responds to Eglinton's "severe" rebuke, "the
doctor can tell us what those words mean" by declining his interpretation
of incest as requiring the psychoanalysis of "the new Viennese school"
(<I>U</I>, 9:738, 780). Instead, Stephen displaces Freud with Aquinas to
elaborate upon his vision of Shakespeare as enthusiastic and exploitative
capitalist, a "moneylender with ten tons of corn hoarded in the famine
riots" (<I>U</I>, 9:743). He asserts that incest is "an avarice of the
emotions," since "the love so given to one near in blood is covetously
withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it" (<I>U</I>,
9:781-3). Incest is here presented as a perversely obsessional form
of self-absorption, where sex, like gold, is hoarded from the outside
world. The onanistic ramifications of this suggestion are elaborated:
"we walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men,
young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves"
(<I>U</I>, 9:1044-6).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Brothers-in-love" moves seamlessly on to "always meeting ourselves,"
a juxtaposition which refers back to Stephen's earlier insistence
that one's male relatives are "grotesque" shadowings of the self to
assert a continuity between brother-love and self-love. Brotherhood is
envisioned as a turning away from life, an unhealthy repression of or
internalization of sexual energies, rather than a utopian state. Stephen's
sustained hypothesis of a correspondence between brotherhood and a
timid, self-absorbed sexuality implies the sterile frustrations behind
theosophy's emphasis upon platonic restraint. Elsewhere in "Scylla,"
Stephen expands upon these hints that theosophy conceals an insular,
claustrophobic and obsessive sexual solipsism.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's hypothesis of "brotherhood" as a form of latent, displaced
sexuality, rather than the utopian asexual state which theosophy
celebrated, exemplifies a sustained rhetorical strategy. Elsewhere in
<I>Ulysses</I>, Joyce subverts theosophy from within, performing highly
ironic interrogations of its enthusiasm for chastity by eroticizing its
ideology and language. If theosophy's interpretation of "brotherhood" as
a sanitised alternative to sexuality is wilfully undercut in Stephen's
reading of "the brother motive" in Shakespeare, then so too is another
central aspect of its belief and practice. While theosophy was committed
to "brotherhood," it was more notoriously concerned not with relationships
between the living, but with those between the living and the dead. It
developed from the late-Victorian enthusiasm for spiritualism and
its materialisation seances and automatic writings which indicated to
believers a secret spectral sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Blavatsky was an acclaimed spiritualist medium during the late 1870s,
 and she began to promote spiritualism's faith in the paranormal within
 the context of wider occult lore.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 With <I>Isis Unveiled</I>  and <I>The Secret Doctrine</I> ,
 she drew heavily on esoteric Buddhism to interpret paranormal events as
 evidence for a new religious faith. Theosophy's appropriation of Buddhism
 and other Eastern doctrines focused particularly upon reincarnation,
 and spirit manifestations were accordingly interpreted as evidence for
 the durability of the soul after death. Blavatsky argued

<B></B>

that this "divine wisdom" was telepathically disclosed to her by the
Masters or Mahatmas, Tibetan spirits who communicated their intentions
through automatic writings and seance manifestations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 When Stephen begins his Shakespeare discourse with the question "what
 is a ghost?" (<I>U</I>, 9:147) he provocatively names the privileged
 object of theosophical quest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One significant premonition of Stephen's strategy of subversive
appropriation occurred in 1904, when Joyce and Buck Mulligan's prototype,
Oliver St John Gogarty, broke into the Dublin theosophical lodge shortly
before a meeting. There, the two discovered what Stephen remembers as a
"Yogibogeybox in Dawson Chambers" (<I>U</I>, 9:281), a spirit cabinet
usually taking the form of a curtained box or large cupboard accessible
only from the front (<I>DR</I>, 46). Next to this "Yogibogeybox" stood
a packing case belonging to George Roberts, at the time combining his
theosophical investigations with a day-job as a traveling underwear
salesman. Joyce purloined a particularly elaborate pair of drawers,
stringing them aloft in the centre of the room suggestively balanced
on a broom handle, while Gogarty attached a note reading "I never
did it" and signed "John Eglinton" as a final flourish (<I>JJ</I>,
174). These high-jinks take on a particularly arch resonance, since
billowing Edwardian knickers produced from a packing case reproduce the
culturally expected image of ghosthood, a nebulous apparition clothed
in white draperies. Joyce and Gogarty's biting visual pun thus placed
on show that sexuality which theosophy tried to repress. Their student
prank burlesqued theosophy's ostentatious chastity by questioning the
nature of the repressed spectres which haunted its members' imaginations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stephen's discourse on ghosts may be more intellectually complex
than Joyce's 1904 practical joke, but it relies upon similar methods
of provoking unease. Stephen similarly manipulates his audiences'
expectations and preconceptions about ghosts to draw a parallel between
the sexual and the spectral. John Eglinton, the most obvious butt of
Joyce and Gogarty's wit, introduces this substitution: "He will have it
that <I>Hamlet</I> is a ghost story, John Eglinton said for Mr Best's
behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep"
(<I>U</I>, 9:141). Eglinton's commonplace misreading of Dickens is
significant. The fat boy refers not to a paranormal occurrence, but to
his vision of the middle-aged lovers Miss Wardle and Mr Tupman "a-huggin
and a-kissin" in a summerhouse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 The following day the fat boy leads Miss Wardle's mother to the
 summerhouse, announces "I wants to make your flesh creep" and tells
 her what he has seen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Eglinton's misremembrance of the context of the much-quoted line thus
 operates in "Scylla" as something of a Freudian slip, as he substitutes
 a ghost story for a sexual secret. Stephen takes up this confusion, as
 his initial attempt to define "what is a ghost" as "one who has faded
 into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
 manners" is soon displaced by an erotically charged account of ghosthood
 (<I>U</I>, 9:147-9). Stephen's argument that Shakespeare should
 be identified with the ghost of King Hamlet relies upon the two men's
 shared identity as cuckolds sexually betrayed by their own brothers. King
 Hamlet's ghost is "endowed with knowledge" of "the poisoning and the
 beast with two backs that urged it" by his "creator," Shakespeare
 "weary of the creation he has piled up to hide himself from himself, an

<B></B>

old dog licking an old sore" (<I>U</I>, 9:470-2). Stephen thus
entangles ghosthood with sexual obsession: his ghosts remain haunted by
the body, its desires, its humiliations. These touches are consolidated
when Stephen responds to Eglinton's objection to his lascivious portrait
of Ann Hathaway. "Carping," Eglinton complains "her ghost at least has
been laid for ever." (<I>U</I>, 9:215). For Stephen, Hathaway's ghost
is laid in another sense:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "local color" Stephen provides to "make [his listeners] accomplices"
takes the form of a highly sexualized backdrop: Sir Walter Raleigh's
"pair of fancy stays," the excessive amount of underlinen hoarded by the
"gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor," "the punks of the bankside, a penny a time,"
"the holy office the ostler does for the stallion" (<I>U</I>, 9:158,
629, 630, 640, 664). Eglinton's ghost "laid for ever" is resuscitated
with such lecherous fervour that Russell, disgusted, rises to leave
for <I>The Homestead</I>, <I></I>his departure prompting a flurry of
invitations to an evening party from which Stephen is pointedly excluded.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Stephen resumes, he significantly offers a metaphor which imagines
ghosthood as an indelible physical trace. Stephen argues that the
"image of the unliving son" bears the traces of "the ghost of the unquiet
father," "as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born,
though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time" (<I>U</I>,
9:379-81). This provocative confusion between the spectral and the
somatic is pointedly sustained elsewhere in <I>Ulysses</I>, where ghosts
are inevitably entangled with sexual encounters or imagery. In "Proteus,"
Stephen's recollection of his dying mother, "the ghostcandle to light her
agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face" is disconcertingly spliced to
his fantasy of the primal scene of his conception: "the man with my voice
and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They clasped and
sundered, did the coupler's will" (<I>U</I>, 3:46-7). In "Hades,"
this association between ghosts and the erotic is taken up by Bloom,
who rephrases the occult as a form of aphrodisiac: "tell her a ghost
story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? . . . Still
they'd kiss right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards"
(<I>U</I>, 6:754-7). Later Bloom expands on the quasi-necrophiliac
effects of this scenario:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This connection between ghosts and sex is reprised in "Circe," where
Bella commands Bloom to "tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody
good ghost story," and where the Croppy Boy "gives up the ghost" as
"a violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through
his deathclothes" (<I>U</I>, 15:3053, 4548). Such macabre associations
enter into dialogue with the kind of anxieties about ghosts and the body
which preoccupied contemporary theosophy.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such anxieties are pointedly addressed in "Cyclops." Alf claims to
have seen Paddy Dignam in Capel Street that morning, his companions are
superstitiously appalled: "You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between
us and harm" (<I>U</I>, 12:326). Alf's spectral sighting is written up
in the jargon of a typical seance report: "in the darkness, spirit hands
were felt to flutter," and Dignam's "etheric double" is disclosed through
"a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light . . . . orangefiery
and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus"
(<I>U</I>, 12:338-44). The "etheric double" was a specific type of
ghost defined in Charles Webster Leadbeater's <I>The Astral Plane</I>
as the spectral state closest to the flesh and comparable to purgatory,
since the virtuous swiftly moved along into "the devanchic condition
where alone his spiritual aspirations can find full fruition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Joyce's "etheric double" of Paddy Dignam, as Leadbeater predicts,
 is indeed preoccupied with the somatic: he requests buttermilk,
 worries about funeral costs, and instructs his son to retrieve a
 boot "under the commode in the return room," while maintaining
 that the spirit world is equipped with such incongruous modern
 conveniences as "t&atilde;l&atilde;f&atilde;n&atilde;,
 &atilde;l&atilde;v&atilde;t&atilde;r,
 h&atilde;t&atilde;k&atilde;ld&atilde;,
 w&atilde;t&atilde;kl&atilde;s&atilde;t" (<I>U</I>, 12:368, 354). Dignam's
 spirit particularly resembles the "etheric double" of the "victim of
 sudden death," abruptly severed from an "earth-life low and brutal,
 selfish and sensual":

His haunts include Capel Street, a slumland backstreet where disreputable
amusements like Mutoscope parlours are to be found, Barney Kiernan's pub,
and later Nighttown outside Bella Cohen's brothel, where he addresses
Bloom: "I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!" (<I>U</I>,
15:1218). More strikingly still, Leadbeater insisted that the "auric egg"
or spirit mist could be classified through color, and that "a lurid,
flaming red" indicated "animal passions"; significantly, not only is
Dignam's "auric egg" of the appropriate debased shade, but also the
"orangefiery and scarlet rays" shine forth from a suggestive zone of
the body, the "sacral region," a coy euphemism for the groin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce's parodic vision of ghosthood as a disconcertingly somatic condition
demonstrates the specificity of his knowledge of theosophy's doctrinal
nuances. Paddy Dignam's etheric double behaves exactly as Charles
Leadbeater predicted the ghost of an "impure" man who met a sudden death
would act: he is preoccupied with the banal and the worldly, he manifests
in the disreputable places he favoured in life, he even emits the fiery
red aura of "animal passions" from his groin. These close coincidences
argue for Joyce's willingness to subvert the minutiae of theosophical
doctrine for his own purposes. To read "Cyclops" and "Scylla" together is
to note how closely Joyce engaged with a fiercely contested issue within
theosophy: the problem of unruly spirit manifestations and the affiliated
question of supernatural desire. Many converts found comfort in the
idea of an asexual paradise awaiting the faithful beyond the grave. For
Charlotte Despard, "In the spiritual world there is no sex. 'There',
said a Master, 'shall

<B></B>

be neither marrying nor giving in marriage; but they shall be as the
angels of God in heaven.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 For W. T. Stead "love beyond the borderland" was reassuringly
 distinct from this life's "temporary passion which is not love, but
 self-indulgence of the worst shape."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 For G. R. S. Mead, editor of the occult journal <I>The Quest,</I> the
 Masters dwelt on "lofty planes of pure morality," while for Gretta
 Cousins, as we have seen, the future world was one where sex would
 be transcended.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 However, Charles Leadbeater provided a controversial and opposing view of
 an afterlife saturated with taboo sexual desires. <I>The Astral Plane</I>
 addressed a disconcerting fault line in contemporary occultism: if the
 afterlife transcended the body's material concerns, how to account for
 the atmosphere of sexual excess which came to dominate seances?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Within the late-Victorian spiritualist movement, materialization
seances like the one Joyce spoofs in "Cyclops" had acquired a certain
notoriety. Young, pretty female mediums entered the spirit cabinet
as exemplary res of Victorian decorum, then appeared as spirits
whose appearance and behaviour was in tantalizing contrast to their
conventionally modest demeanor (<I>DR</I>, 219-56). The acclaimed
medium Elizabeth D'Esperance produced "Yolande," who was "a beautiful Arab
girl, olive-skinned and dark haired," and who appeared in the flimsiest
interpretation of Egyptian costume, while her rival Florence Cook's
"Katie King," dressed in diaphanous robes, accepted bouquets and gifts,
kissed and sat on the laps of male admirers, and invited enthusiasts
to "pass their hands over her dress in order that they might satisfy
themselves she wore only a robe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Other spectacular evidences of supernatural presences, such as the
 ectoplasmic extrusions from later mediums' mouths, nipples and, on
 occasion, genitals, compounded existing suspicions that it was sex,
 not ghosts, that occult practitioners were really liberating.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This seance eroticism was widely publicized since spiritualist enthusiasm
was repeatedly linked by a hostile medical establishment to hysteria, a
condition with unsavoury sexual connotations (<I>DR</I>, 139). Dr. Forbes
Winslow set the tone: "The community of believers contains a large
proportion of weak-minded, hysterical women in whom the seeds of disorder
are only waiting for a new excitement to ripen into maturity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 <I>The British Medical Journal</I> concurred: "Hysteria is doubtless
 the disease which more than any other furnishes the most abundant crop
 of fruit to the Spiritualists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 For Henry Maudsley, one of the leading Victorian medical
 psychopathologists, the ecstatic state of mediumship was mere "emotional
 incontinence" resulting from "irregularities of menstruation and
 suspected self-abuse" and an excess of "heavily disguised venereal
 passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 These responses indicate how closely occult practice was linked
 to diseased sexuality, and place Joyce's own lively responses to
 seances in sudden relief. Flaunting ladies' bloomers in Ely Place
 in 1904 seems a loaded allusion to the practices which sullied the
 reputation of contemporary occultism, an allusion shadowed in Stephen
 Dedalus's seemingly gratuitous references to Elizabeth Tudor's hoard of
 underlinen and Walter Raleigh's "fancy stays." Joyce places on show what
 commonly issued from the spirit cabinet; scantily clad "ghosts," who
 disconcertingly resembled the smutty postcards, indecent stereoscopes,
 and <I>tableaux vivants</I> of popular erotic entertainments. Sly
 allusions to an occultism repeatedly constituted as a displaced

<B></B>

form of "venereal passions" are elaborated in Stephen's oppressive stream
of innuendo and his discussion of ghosthood as a condition of sexual
obsession. Stephen's Shakespeare theory is resonant of the scepticism
of the late-Victorian medical establishment which attributed seance
manifestations to sexually stigmatised hysteria. His insistence that
theosophy is an indirect, evasive and obsessional way of negotiating
a sexuality which alternately terrified and fascinated his listeners
is rendered particularly specific in the closing pages of "Scylla,"
where Buck Mulligan effervescently "reads" Stephen's theory to disclose
its hidden slur. Mulligan repeatedly constitutes masturbation as the
concealed vice of "that hermetic crowd," alluding, as we shall see,
to sustained and well-publicised contemporary cultural anxieties.

3. Charles Webster Leadbeater: Theosophy in the "Foul Masturbation
Abyss"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1906, a Chicago theosophist, Helen Dennis, discovered a letter to
her thirteen year old son from Charles Leadbeater, the deputy leader of
the London-Adyar branch of the Theosophy Society. Written in a simple
code, it instructed her son to masturbate twice weekly, and included
the damning line "glad sensation is so pleasant."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Leadbeater was called before a disciplinary committee in London
 dominated by social purity sympathizers, where he argued that he was
 "clairvoyantly aware" of the "sex problems" tormenting his young pupils,
 and so advocated masturbation as a "a preventative against unchastity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 His "safety-valve" defence radically departed from the social purity
 orthodoxy that masturbation was a debilitating evil in itself, leading
 to physical decay, mental instability, emasculation, and further
 immoralities. It failed to convince the London committee, and Leadbeater
 was expelled. His influence as "one of the world's foremost scientists
 in spiritual research," however, meant that the scandal could not be
 so simply contained (<I>EB</I>, 5). The 1907 trial confirmed rumours
 prevalent since 1897, when Leadbeater began to urge parents to entrust
 the spiritual development of their sons to him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 His flamboyant chastity further exacerbated suspicions: he pointedly
 refused to shake hands with women at meetings, and, when a guest
 of married couples, insisted they occupy separate bedrooms for the
 duration of his stay, eccentricities which prompted one host to comment
 "his tastes run mainly to boys and tapioca pudding" (<I>EB</I>, 199).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Those who hoped in 1907 for an "end to this wretched controversy"
 which had for the past decade "threatened to plunge Theosophy into the
 foul masturbation abyss" were disappointed (<I>LC</I>, 18). Supporters
 of Leadbeater were numerous enough to force the London committee to
 reaffirm their decision in 1909.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 By then, publicity threatened to render "the public propagation of
 theosophy impossible"; it was vital "to rid the Theosophical Society of
 this foul blot upon its name and fame," and such fears were not unfounded
 (<I>LC</I>, 5). Throughout 1909 the London paper <I>John Bull</I> ran
 a sustained campaign, running headlines such as "A Teacher of Filth"
 and "Pitiful Degradation of the London Theosophical Lodge," while its
 editor Horace Bottomley, M. P., threatened to alert the Director of
 Public Prosecutions that "the Theosophical society is gathering into
 it ranks an army of morbid moral degenerates whose teachings are

<B></B>

calculated to undermine the character and sap the manhood of our race"
(<I>LC</I>, 20).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Other English papers concurred with <I>John Bull</I>: the <I>New
 Statesman</I> noted that no other modern adventurer had built up such
 a police dossier, while the <I>Times</I> and the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>
 regularly ran articles of protest in a similar vein (<I>EB</I>, 180). The
 controversy rumbled on well into the 1920s, following Leadbeater to
 India, where his adoption of two Hindu boys prompted their father to sue
 for restitution of his children in 1912 in a bizarre lawsuit combining
 charges of deification and sodomy, and to Australia where a series of
 articles in the Sydney <I>Daily Telegraph</I> during 1922 prompted a
 full-scale police investigation (<I>EB</I>, 200).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the global and highly public nature of "the Leadbeater affair,"
one might speculate that Joyce, an avowed sceptic who, I have urged,
borrowed from key Leadbeater texts, relished the scandal. Certainly,
speculation that Joyce knew of theosophy's seamier side are encouraged
in the closing pages of "Scylla." Masturbation is the centrepiece of
Buck Mulligan's parody of the Hermetists who listen to Stephen, and its
centrality must have been bitingly resonant by 1919 and 1920, when Joyce
was composing the chapter and theosophy had already endured more than
two decades of persistent scandal over the solitary vice. Mulligan builds
upon a theme slyly introduced by Stephen, who draws an implicit parallel
between Hamlet, "an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself,"
and his listeners, "unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder
nightly each his variorum edition of <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>"
(<I>U</I>, 9:1052, 1062). Stephen presents both Hamlet and his audience
as ghosthunters terrified of procreative, interactive sexuality and
instead confined to the sexual cul-de-sac of autoeroticism. Hamlet
is "a wife unto himself," and the bawdy ramifications of his sexual
self-reliance are drawn out with the word "fingerponder," an intrusion
of the manual heavily weighted with double entendre. Stephen associates
literary Dublin with the kind of forestalled sexuality which Mulligan
will later castigate as particularly Irish in "Oxen of the Sun,"
and these insinuations are voluble in the context of theosophy's
associations. Leadbeater's enthusiasm for masturbation was only the most
notorious instance of a contraceptive strain running through theosophy,
not only through its insistence on chastity, but more problematically
through Blavatsky's often-repeated claim that a "crooked cucumber"
guaranteed her celibacy, and through Annie Besant's troubling past as a
radical campaigner for birth control. Stephen's hints that theosophical
sexuality is strangulated, sterile, and secretly self-indulgent are taken
up by Mulligan, who offers Eglinton the parting-shot "Monsieur Moore,
. . . lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland" (<I>U</I>,
9:1001-2). Mulligan makes the associative leap between contraception,
or "conjugal onanism" as it was widely known, and masturbation with his
parody of Yeats's 1903 "Baile and Aillinn." Yeats's poem would no doubt
have delighted the Hermetists, since it celebrated lovers who transcended
sexual union in favour of the higher spiritual affinities to be found
in the afterlife, thus evading the decay and disappointments of sexuality:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yeats's vision of love purified is drastically burlesqued by Mulligan,
who transforms a virtue into a necessity. Yeats's "curlew cry" becomes
a "purlieu cry," the lure of the brothel area Joyce later presented
as Nighttown, where British "Tommies" like Privates Carr and Compton
patrolled in search of women (<I>U</I>, 9:1043, 1044). Yeats's chaste
lovers are displaced by a more incongruous pairing, Eglinton and the
minor Revivalist Frederick M'Curdy Atkinson, bound together through a
chastity produced not through restraint so much as incapacity. Atkinson's
"wooden leg" and Eglinton/Magee's "chinless mouth" "that never dared to
slake his drouth" are cruelly visceral metonyms of impotence, in ironic
contrast to Yeats's lovers, whose chaste progress to the afterlife spares
them somatic decay (<I>U</I>, 9:1147, 1149, 1150). Mulligan ascribes their
purity not to spiritual strength, but to mental and corporeal weakness:
"Being afraid to marry on earth / They masturbated for all they were
worth" (<I>U</I>, 9:1150-1. With his spoof play for "the mummers":

and its hero "Toby Tostoff, a ruined Pole," he extends his view
of Eglinton's and Atkinson's sexuality to the whole of the Dublin
theosophical-literary establishment (<I>U</I>, 9:1181). Mulligan's puns
on "French letters," his parody of Yeats, and his spoof play for the
Abbey together read the various cultural enterprises of the Revival as
substitutions for and evasions of sexual creativity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Scylla and Charybdis" is thus structured to reveal pervasive cultural
associations between a Revivalism intimately connected to theosophy and
a secretive sexual deviancy. Stephen's Shakespeare theory allegorically
interrogates theosophy to unfold provocative connections with a cautious,
concealed, and claustrophobic sexuality; Mulligan's verbal play names
this sexuality as masturbation, thus alluding to a highly contentious
scandal which theosophy was trying to conceal. If, as I have argued,
the Leadbeater affair is a submerged intertext in "Scylla," then the
chapter parallels the repressive hypothesis which dogged contemporary
occultism. The Leadbeater controversy was so eloquent to theosophy's
critics because it articulated in a particularly obvious manner the
sexuality suspected to lurk beneath theosophy's high-minded facade,
exposing fault lines in that facade already evident in speculations
over spiritualism's salacious seance manifestations, Blavatsky's marital
status and illegitimate children, or even Annie Besant's former enthusiasm
for contraception. This repressive dynamic is similarly encoded within
"Scylla," where Mulligan's remarks explicate Stephen's Shakespeare
monologue: his naming of masturbation as the dark side of theosophical
chastity offers

<B></B>

to retrieve what the movement's sexual politics buried. Masturbation in
"Scylla" is thus deeply politically resonant, as Joyce uses Mulligan to
signpost the implications of Stephen's monologue in that "history of
cultural conflict" which Len Platt defines as central to "Scylla." If
"Scylla" is an episode dominated, as Platt suggests, by snide attacks
and bitter asides, by submerged hostilities and battles for cultural
possession and prestige, then Stephen's assault upon theosophy's sexual
pretensions is a particularly effective instance of this maliciously
playful sniping.

4. The Sewer of Their Clique: Theosophy, Joyce, and Censorship
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A further dimension to Joyce's sustained attack on theosophical sexuality
can be glimpsed in the publication history of "Scylla." Writing to Harriet
Shaw Weaver in October 1918, Joyce regretted "my book <I>Ulysses</I>
appears to be giving you a great deal of trouble," adding "I am writing
now the Hamlet episode" (i.e., "Scylla and Charybdis").
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Joyce linked Weaver's eventually thwarted attempts to find a British
 printer willing to risk the obscenity laws and print episodes of
 <I>Ulysses</I> in the <I>Egoist</I> with the composition of "Scylla,"
 a connection which must have become increasingly evident as the months
 progressed. Joyce was composing the first draft of "Scylla" from late
 1918 through to February 1919, and was simultaneously preoccupied
 with <I>Ulysses's</I> travails with the censors in the United States,
 where the novel was appearing in Margaret Anderson's and Jane Heap's the
 <I>Little Review</I> (<I>JJ</I>, 441-2). The <I>Little Review</I>
 was first suppressed in January, 1919, when John Sumner, chairman of
 the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, forced the U.S. Post
 Office to confiscate the "Lestrygonians" number. It was confiscated under
 a law initiated by Sumner's predecessor, the notorious vice crusader
 Antony Comstock, which prohibited material deemed obscene from being
 distributed through the postal system.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Further confrontation with these moral vigilantes was to come:
 "Scylla" itself was confiscated in May 1919, "Nausicaa" in August,
 and in February 1921 social purity triumphed over <I>Ulysses</I> when
 The <I>Little Review</I> was convicted of obscenity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Margaret Anderson had struggled with Sumner for some years, unwillingly
attempting to appease the N.Y.S.S.V. in the May, 1919, issue of her
journal, where she prefaced "Scylla" with a complaint over the January
confiscation: "To avoid a similar interference this month, I have ruined
Mr Joyce's story by cutting certain passages in which he mentions natural
facts known to everyone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 However, while Anderson in America was excising "natural facts," Joyce
 was adding them: successive drafts of "Scylla" disclose a process of
 revision with a distinct flavor of Joycean bloody-mindedness. The
 revision process began in late 1918, when Joyce added specific
 theosophical details to <I>The Little Review</I> proofs; "allfather,
 the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful," "the life
 esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first"
 and "the name ineffable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 However, after "Scylla's" suppression in May 1919, Joyce's revising
 pencil is directed not so much towards theosophy, but more to the
 chapter's disputed sexual content. In November 1920, alterations for
 Sylvia Beach's planned edition exacerbate the allusions: "argive Helen"
 becomes "the wooden mare

<B></B>

of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept," the passage describing
various "incests and bestialities" which Anderson reluctantly removed is
elaborated with "lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name"
(<I>JJA</I> 18: 182, 198).
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Joyce adds also "between conjugal love and its chaste delights and
 scortatory love and its foul pleasures," and, more provokingly still,
 transforms Ann Hathaway into a faded, jaded tract-reading Puritan, a
 dangerous equivalent to contemporary purity censors: "She read or had
 read to her his chapbooks, preferring them to <I>The Merry Wives</I> and
 thought over <I>Hooks and Eyes For Believer's Breeches</I> and <I>The
 Most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze</I>"
 (<I>JJA</I> 18: 197). In late 1921, making final revisions to the
 Darentiere and Beach galley proofs in the aftermath of <I>The Little
 Review's</I> suppression that year, "Scylla" becomes more confrontational
 still. "Prologue to the swelling act" is added to Stephen's initial
 portrait of Ann Hathaway, "jailbirds with keyholes" to the "incest and
 bestialities" catalogue Anderson felt forced to censor (<I>JJA</I>
 23: 248, 332). Furthermore, the final couplet of Buck Mulligan's
 Yeats parody, "being afraid to marry upon earth / They masturbated
 for all they were worth," only appears on this final revision: until
 then, Joyce avoided naming so explicitly the solitary vice for which
 theosophy had become renown (<I>JJA</I> 23: 340). Joyce's modifications
 emphasise, rather than tone down, the connections between theosophy
 and a disordered sexuality my chapter has outlined. His modifications
 can only be interpreted as deliberate defiance of the vice-crusaders
 which made <I>Ulysses</I> a target.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two early poems, "The Holy Office"  and "Gas From a Burner"
 offer a key to the role of theosophy in Joyce's strategy
of provocation. Both responded to Joyce's early experiences of
sexually-motivated censorship. "The Holy Office" was distributed after
Harry Norman refused to take any more <I>Dubliners</I> stories for <I>The
Irish Homestead</I> on the grounds that "his readers had complained,"
and after Joyce's essay "The Day of the Rabblement," attacking the Irish
Literary Theatre for producing moral but mediocre Irish plays had been
rejected by <I>St. Stephen's,</I> the University College magazine to
which Joyce also unsuccessfully submitted the poem itself. "Gas from a
Burner" commented on the collapse of negotiations with George Roberts
to publish <I>Dubliners</I>: Roberts complained "the book's implication
were anti-Irish and therefore out of keeping with an Irish publisher,"
whilse his printer George Falconer reneged on a promise to sell Joyce
the sheets, burning them instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Joyce made his assault upon social purity censors more explicit still
 in his initial title, "Mr Falconer Addresses the Vigilance Committee."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 The broadsides foreshadow Joyce's critical method in "Scylla" because
 both associate the threat of censorship with theosophy. "The Holy Office"
 singled out Dublin Hermetists Yeats, Roberts, Russell and Eglinton for
 particular censure; "all these men of whom I speak / Make me the sewer
 of their clique. / That they may dream their dreamy dreams / I carry
 off their filthy streams" (<I>PSW</I>, 98). Joyce's insistence that
 his "office of Katharsis" ventilated the kinds of somatic desires
 theosophists, with their "timid arses," feared to acknowledge was
 repeated in "Gas from a Burner." Ventriloquizing George Roberts, Joyce
 complained "I printed mystical books in dozens: / I printed the table
 book of Cousins / Though (asking your pardon) as for the verse / T'would
 give you a heartburn on your arse" (<I>PSW</I>, 104). Having assumed a

<B></B>

corollary between Roberts's timid refusal to print <I>Dubliners</I>
and his role as a staunch supporter of theosophical effusions, Joyce
again insists that mysticism and bad verse masked a furtive, secretive,
and dishonest sexuality: "In the porch of my printing institute / The
poor and deserving prostitute / Plays every night at catch-as-catch-can /
With her tight-breeched British artilleryman" (<I>PSW</I>, 105). Joyce's
striking image of Maunsell and Company at night metonymically discloses
the underbelly of its daytime reputation for moral probity. Sexual
transgression hovers ratively on the porch of the establishment,
under cloak of darkness: so Joyce suggests it lurks on the margins and in
the shadows of Irish theosophy, a disavowed yet nonetheless present force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These broadsides offer an intriguing perspective on "Scylla" because they
emphasize how closely the young Joyce's early experiences of censorship
were bound up with and attributed to Irish theosophical prudery. In
"Scylla," written fifteen years after his flight from Dublin, Joyce
addresses the contemporary censorship threat at one remove, returning
to the Dublin of his youth, where theosophy was the strand of social
purity ideology most influential in Irish literary circles. Theosophy
stands for social purity censorship in "Scylla": its sexual timidity
exemplifies a wider climate of artistic censorship with which Joyce's
writings so often conflicted. Joyce's assault upon theosophy is thus
a metonymic assault upon the censorious gaze. His revisions show how,
during the months <I>Ulysses</I> was under this gaze, Joyce elaborated and
amplified the provocative connections between theosophy and the obscene
which have been outlined. His revisions make bold one of "Scylla's"
themes; how sexual tensions disrupt the moralizing facade. Sexuality
seethes through "Scylla," most obviously in Stephen's innuendo-laden
Shakespeare theory which playfully subverts theosophy's doctrinal
enthusiasms for brotherhood and ghosthood as states of inviolable
purity. Stephen reappraises "universal brotherhood" as a stifling
homosocial bond, ghosthood as a condition of sexual obsession, and
"Scylla" slyly substantiates the theosophical resonances of his argument
as Joyce encodes allusions to contemporary suspicions and scandals which
theosophy was unable to contain. By anchoring theosophy to the kinds
of scandals it unsuccessfully attempted to ignore, from spiritualism's
associations with sexual hysteria to, more specifically, the long-running
Leadbeater controversy, Joyce places moralizing discourses of sexual
proscription upon an eloquent continuum. The prostitute on the porch of
Maunsell and Company in "Gas from a Burner" is marginal, extraneous to the
institution, in its shadow: in "Scylla," Joyce goes further, representing
sexuality not as a force prudishly excluded from theosophy and clamouring
at the door to be let in, but rather as intrinsic to it, submerged within
a discourse of chastity which, as the Leadbeater case so devastatingly
suggested, incites while it prohibits. Joyce's depiction of theosophy in
"Scylla and Charybdis" argues that rather than repressing and controlling
sexuality, moralizing propagandists covertly participate in and amplify
the desires they deny. "Scylla" thus contributes to a sustained Joycean
theme: the underground correlation between vice and vigilance.

"The very existence of psychoanalysis," John Forrester has observed,
"is a permanent testimony to the failure of communication."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 It is a comment which might remind us how keenly the Surrealists
 sensed that the psychopathology of cognitive failure (the aphasias,
 the psychoses, as well as the psychoneuroses) could provide models
 for alternative patterns of attention and communication. Indeed, any
 adequate appreciation of Surrealist automatism must begin with just
 this sense of the new possibilities offered by alternative forms of
 attention, promising access to different perspectives of experience
 and world-projection. For

<B></B>

Artaud, Bataille, Breton, and others, appreciating that the ontological
possibilities inherent in the psychopathology of failure could be
the precondition for certain forms of creativity was grounded in an
awareness of the key role that dialogue plays in psychiatric discourse,
whether in the recent field of trauma studies ushered in by the Great
War or the older case studies of patients such as Charcot's Augustine
X.L. or Blanche Wittman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 For Breton and Artaud, in particular, the question of dialogue was linked
 to a movement of disorientation that always posed the question of the
 imago as a means of confronting the imbrication of time and sense. As
 Monique Borie expressed it of Artaud, "Going beyond the question of
 meaning's closure, Artaud is always concerned with the question of
 communication."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Dialogue, in other words, did not necessarily lead to communication, as
 one can easily see in the poignant examples of non-communication between
 doctor and patient which are represented in Charcot's <I>Iconographie
 photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Throughout the existence of the Surrealist movement, forms of dialogue
 will provide privileged sites for the exploration of this question,
 especially in its dimensions of negativity, movement, and the
 <I>informe</I> (formlessness).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nowhere is this question of non-communication and dialogue better
manifested than in Breton's famous narrative <I>Nadja</I>, and in
particular in the discussion surrounding the various drawings which
Nadja gives to Breton. On the one hand, there is the work which Breton
titles <I>A True Shield of Achilles</I>, a drawing charged with archaic
imagery (the devil, a siren, serpents) of a sort typical of psychosis,
a sort in which the temporality of the preconscious collapses into the
<I>Zeitlos</I>/anachronism of the unconscious and so turns place (in this
case, the place of the drawing itself) into a functional imbrication of
different temporalities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, there are Nadja's final sketches, making up a work
 which, unlike the other drawings by her which are all reproduced in
 photographs, is known only through Breton's verbal account of it:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In these, on a table, in front of an open book, a cigarette lying on an
ashtray and insidiously releasing a serpent of smoke, a globe cut open
to hold lilies, between the hands of a beautiful woman--everything
was arranged to permit the descent of what she called <I>the human
reflector</I>, kept off by forceps, and which she said was "the best of
all." [<I>N</I>, 130/155-57]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this work, the "globe cut open" suggests a complete identification
between desire and the ideal in a manner typical of the megalomania of
psychosis: the psychotic who thinks he is God the Father, the Son of
God, Mary, a saint, or Napoleon. Here, however, the telling point is
not megalomania's violence, buts its projection onto the entire world
("a globe" or "mappemonde") and its response to the power of someone
("the human reflector") who is "'the best of all.'" Tellingly, Breton's
account of the final drawing is followed by blank space occupying about
a line, then a prolonged ellipse of dots that stretch across the page,
then another blank space. No other section of the narrative is followed
by such a notable silence, one which registers Breton's growing awareness
of, and his inability to avoid, the brutal fact of Nadja's borderline
condition. Moreover, this account is carefully separated from the
discussion which treats the

<B></B>

main body of Nadja's drawings, and also from the virulent denunciation of
psychiatry which follows. And if this textual silence signals a rueful
recognition of Nadja's state--and note how the presence of mourning is
secured by the absence of its object, the drawing itself, which is not
reproduced--then it will come as no surprise to find a mirror image, as it
were, of the same dynamics at work in the siting of the next drawing by
Nadja. That work, a drawing titled <I>The Soul of the Wheat</I> and the
last by her to be reproduced in the book, has been carefully separated
from all her others and inserted into the section denouncing psychiatry,
where it immediately follows the photograph of Professor Claude, epitome
of the psychiatric profession's blindness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Placed here, the drawing's presence becomes a mournful mark of Nadja's
 absence, her disappearance into the sanatorium, even as it simultaneously
 reminds us of the archaic imagery of <I>The True Shield of Achilles</I>,
 particularly in its understated evocation of the grain associated with
 Demeter, and acknowledges such imagery's threatened status by means
 of the scythe sweeping toward the wheat. Abundance and plentifulness
 (wheat, Demeter) are juxtaposed against death and mourning (the scythe),
 a movement also recapitulated in other drawings and even in Breton's
 and Nadja's wanderings through the city. "Pink is better than black,
 but the two harmonize" ("s'accordent"), says Nadja in a maxim which
 Breton later recalls (<I>N</I>, 116/138), as if suggesting that such
 discordances might be harmonized or gathered into some reciprocity,
 in much the same way that Breton and Nadja's different personalities
 might potentially complement each other. But over the course of
 <I>Nadja</I>, what begins as a suggestion of mutual reciprocity,
 epitomized in the glances that Breton and Nadja exchange at their
 first meeting, modulates into projective identification and thence
 into a form of intra-subjectivity--the lack of relation to something
 beyond one's individual consciousness--which bypasses and yet encloses
 Breton. It is this movement of failed relationality that I should like
 to explore in this essay, doing so by considering the role that silence
 plays in Breton's <I>construction</I> of <I>Nadja</I>, which is to say,
 in how he elaborates his relation to the temporality of his encounter
 with Nadja. Construction, here, is used in the sense intended by Freud
 when he wrote that the task of the analyst is "to make out what has been
 forgotten from the traces which it has left behind, or, more correctly,
 to <I>construct</I> it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Breton senses the psychotic dimensions of Nadja's drawing of the
globe, he responds with silence and effectively acknowledges the call
of what he has earlier called "our very instinct of self-preservation"
(<I>N</I>, 20/21). His response is to narrate--"the desire to tell
<I>you</I>," as he later says to X (<I>N</I>,156/184). But to respond
to the kind of narrating that will be <I>Nadja</I>, we must consider
the nature of his silence and its relation to Nadja's final drawing of
"a globe cut open to hold lilies."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Few topics in Breton's thinking are as difficult of treatment as
that of silence. Certainly, in the tacit importance of silence in
his <I>oeuvre</I>, Breton, who in his early days had been a disciple
of Val&eacute;ry, is part and parcel of that high European modernism,
beginning with Symbolism, in which silence is accorded a critical role
in the experience of thought and registers deepening doubts about the
limits of discursivity. But behind Val&eacute;ry's fascination with
silence was another aspect of his thought which Eliot later noted, one
that also fascinated Breton. As Breton later recalled: "But perhaps the

<B></B>

most piquante aspect of his [Val&eacute;ry's] conversation was when his
'profoundly destructive, even nihilistic mind,' which so rightly impressed
T. S. Eliot, showed through."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 It was because of a similar nihilist spirit that Breton's conception of
 silence, however strongly shaped by Symbolism, never formed part of a
 broader mysticism<I>.</I> Whence his attempt, in 1936, to distinguish
 the Surrealist marvelous (<I>merveilleux</I>) from Symbolist mystery
 (<I>myst&egrave;re</I>), while still recognizing that both had common
 roots in a historical moment when "the bridge of communication between
 humans has been broken."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The effort of communication between Breton and Nadja, an effort that is
prolonged into the construction of the narrative <I>Nadja</I>, teems
with silences: they function as bridges, openings, and reciprocities,
and at times they signal the recognition of limits or an admission of
failure. As an effort of interpretation, of construction, the narrative
<I>Nadja</I> inevitably contains such reflections, however tacit, on
what both connects and disconnects, on the formality or measure of the
experience that is the narrative. The many intervals, which are marks
of difference and a staging of distance, which occur between the events
that take place in the story and their construction within the narrative,
signal an alternative mode of attention at work, one discernible from
the moment that the work comes embedded with marks of silence, that
long pause which follows Nadja's mention of "<I>the human reflector</I>
. . . 'the best of all.'"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such silence allows for no movement other than that of circularity. But
while Nadja's final drawing leaves Breton no choice but to recognize and
acknowledge the demented nature of her experience, the ensuing silence
also gathers up and returns to what has been tacitly present from the
book's famous opening sentence, "Qui suis-je?" (which can mean either "Who
am I?" or "Whom am I following?"). The caesura following this ambiguous
interrogative is momentous: it recapitulates the devastating dividedness
of the experience which Breton's and Nadja's wanderings have produced,
in much the same way as the sentence itself allows the speaker to relive
the same fragmentation, an experience that is proleptic of the narrative
experience to come. The ambiguous interrogative opens a movement of
doubling from which the narrative construction never deviates, one that
discloses a crucial aspect of silence: the doubling that is heralded by
the opening interrogation is both temporal ("Whom am I following?") and
nontemporal ("Who am I?"). But in refusing the non-temporality of
anteriority, as the image of the <I>fant&ocirc;me</I> would seem to
imply to him, in favor of a temporality of <I>temps v&eacute;cu</I>,
Breton leaves the construction open to a double temporality and its
attendant resonances and disturbances, particularly where such temporality
encounters silence in the texture of the feminine, or the feminine in
its absence as trace.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Silence, in other words, is one of the means by which embodiment
in its prepredicative modality is lived in Nadja and in Surrealist
experience. The inscription of silence is not possible apart from the
body, which serves as a perceptual mechanism linked to the unconscious
in much the same way as Freud describes experience being inscribed on the
unconscious through the image of a note pad which retains the impression
of writing from the previous leaves which have since vanished.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 When the <I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> of depth, or the timelessness
 of the unconscious, encounters a lived and transred instant,
 unconscious memory takes the subject into the depth

<B></B>

and disperses, as it were, the surface writing, as mute experience seeks
its articulation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Silence may well be a precondition for that articulation, but it can
 also pose a threat to it. As Rousseau, whose statue adorns the square
 from which Breton sets out on his journey, understood, silence can be
 an innocent medium for intimacies beyond language, and hence beyond
 corruption; but it can also become a mark of absolute separation--not
 silence as transparence and finely modulated lyric moments, but silence
 become obstacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 When silence as obstacle is articulated with memory, as occurs at
 the moment Breton recalls Nadja's drawings, it raises questions about
 silence's metaphorical or symbolic value. What does silence symbolize? In
 their disagreement about the phylogenetic aspect of symbolism, Freud
 and Jung came to crystallize their differences around two issues:
 the status of the maternal, and silence. Jung wished to abandon the
 Oedipus complex and place in its stead the re of the eternal mother,
 but at the price of lacking any worthy account of temporality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Yet his attitude toward silence is a challenge to which Freud never
 adequately responded, for Jung's challenge merely served to consolidate
 Freud's mistrust of any attempt to diminish the role of language in
 shaping the distinctiveness of psychoanalysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 John Forrester conveys the dispute thus: "What the conflict amounted to
 was the fundamental difference of attitude towards the ineffable. Freud,
 in absorbing the ineffable into the inexpressible, and in his verbal
 rationalism, distrusted the symbol insofar as it became pure Image,
 and was detached from the Word."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 For Jung silence could open into the archaic and the maternal, while
 for Freud it was simply a mark of resistance in the transference--and
 thereby "the danger of proximity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 For both, however, and inescapably so, it signalled a failure of
 symbolization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Breton disavowed the high Symbolist mysticism of silence, his
thinking, from the inception of automatism, repeatedly returned to the
phenomenology of silence. In approaching the conception of silence at work
in the construction of <I>Nadja</I>, we shall see that it takes us back
into the heart of the book, into its interior as an act of unfolding,
a slow circular opening out that is perhaps the characteristic movement
of Breton's writing in <I>Nadja</I>, one which leaves the narrator
caught in flux and parallel meanings. It is an unfolding movement
that also contains a form of layering, the topology of which is very
close to Freud's image of the writing-pad. (This unfolding movement
finds its reflex in Breton's habitual recourse to words with floral
connotations.) Such unfolding lets the narrative explore the relation
between silence as resistence and silence to the maternal. Failures of
symbolization, the silences that punctuate <I>Nadja</I>, are not simply
the outcome of an attempt to manipulate skilfully the reader's feelings;
they are indices of Breton's condition in the act of constructing the
work, and they testify to the faltering in Breton's desire for the human
being who was Nadja, a failure of emotional investment or cathexis. As
Monique Schneider argues, "In that sense, we could consider trauma as
a 'failure of inscription,' a failure inseparable from another sort
of incapacity: incapacity to invest oneself in what arrives, with the
result that the only possible form of investment is concentrated into a
reaction of refusal" (<I>Pdl'O</I>, 93). The construction of the narrative
<I>Nadja</I> thus becomes an attempt to manage this failure of desire
and its various intervals--of silence, temporalities, and understanding--

<B></B>

through new strategies of cathexis that require repetition: for Breton
to tell the <I>story</I>, first to "himself" and then ostensibly to X,
is to acknowledge and, from his and Nadja's viewpoint, to relive "the
irreparable disaster sweeping away a part of herself . . . the disaster
of which that day [first] gave me a notion . . ." (<I>N</I>, 114/135).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The disaster which Breton first divines on that day, Sunday, 10
October, 1926, is tacitly signalled through a particular form of the
counter-transference: boredom. Though boredom can be thought of as
dissolving the psychic processes responsible for the presence of form
preparatory to the giving on to exteriority, it nevertheless remains
compatible with fascination and even the possibility of participation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Something of this is discernible when Breton recounts his relationship
 of participation with Nadja, which never allows him to be separate,
 untouched, or unaffected by "the irreparable disaster." When on
 Wednesday, 6 October, Nadja opens her copy of Breton's most recent book,
 <I>The Lost Steps</I>, she turns to the essay "The New Spirit," which
 tersely records Breton's enigmatic encounters with a charming woman
 whom he subsequently pursues but cannot locate. Nadja has read it and
 "is astonished and disappointed by the fact that I had considered
 commentaries on the account of the day's brief occurrences quite
 superfluous" (<I>N</I>, 78/89-90). She presses Breton for an
 explanation and an indication "about the degree of objectivity which I
 attribute to it" (<I>N</I>, 78/90). His response, reported as indirect
 speech, bears upon the construction of <I>Nadja</I> and his relation
 to Nadja:

impatience, then consternation in her eyes. Perhaps she imagines I am
lying: a certain discomfiture persists between us. [<I>N</I>, 78/90;
translation modified]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a pivotal instant in the tacit articulation of silences and
temporalities: the means of bearing witness ("de constater") make
Breton's position of observation into a double one, in which he is both
the reporter of an event and "the first victim" of his own report. But
Nadja's questions touch on the possibility that this observing double
is simply fictional, raising the spectre of deception. Her bodily
impatience and consternation register the possibility of distance,
while a perceptible tension between the two ("a certain discomfiture")
registers another multiplicity in silence. True, that tension may seem
to be dissipated or resolved by the ensuing first kiss, which follows
shortly. But Nadja's consternation isn't sexual; it concerns Breton's
attitude toward "the lack of results of this pursuit" (<I>N</I>, 78/89),
<I>pursuit</I> referring to both the woman and the essay that recounts his
failure to find her again. It indicates the distinct temporalities that
stand between her and Breton: he has the capacity to turn events into
discourse and can be a subject in both realms, versus her suspicion of
this fruitless pursuit, a discrepancy that anticipates their different
fates by the book's end. Her consternation also recalls the earlier
moment, on Tuesday, 5 October, when Nadja first receives copies of the
"Manifesto of Surrealism" and <I>The Lost Steps</I> and we see the first
tacit signs of boredom:

<I>October 5.</I> --Nadja is here first, ahead of time. She no longer
looks the way she did yesterday. Rather elegant today, in black and
red, with an extremely pretty hat which she takes off, revealing
her straw-colored hair which has lost its incredible disorder, silk
stockings and shoes which, unlike yesterday's, are quite presentable. The
conversation has also come more difficult and starts on her part with
a number of hesitations. [<I>N</I>, 72/83]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This barely passable elegance contrasts sharply with Breton's first
glimpse of her, when she is a person charged with "that look which is hers
alone" (<I>N</I>, 72/82; translation modified). The later consternation
of Nadja's body amplifies this earlier discomfiture and hints at her
suspicion that she may well become a victim of Breton's genius, of what
she terms his "great idea" (<I>N</I>, 70/81). As she surveys the crowds
hurrying homeward, all those people who will not be the actors in the
revolution ("Everyone is hurrying around us . . ."), she says to Breton:
"Hearing you speak, I felt that nothing would hold you back, nothing,
not even me" (<I>N</I>, 70/81). Her remark, as reported by Breton, uses
language remarkably consonant with the voice of "Subject" ("Subjet"),
the reconstructed soliloquy of a shell-shocked soldier which Breton had
published in early 1918:

It is a chilling echo that alerts a discerning reader to the dangers
that will eventually engulf Nadja. The monitory note is struck again
when Breton and Nadja meet two days later, on 6 October, with Nadja
"looking as she did the first day I saw her" (<I>N</I>, 77/88), exuding
that "look" which Breton has so highly esteemed. Just before the episode
turns to the occasion of the first kiss, Breton reports: "She seems to
be suffering from a certain inner conflict . . ." ("une certaine lutte
para&icirc;t aussi se poursuivre en elle")(<I>N</I>, 79/92). The passage,
in its rhythm and diction, and in evoking a threshold experience, recalls
that dramatic moment when the audience recognizes that the child in the
play <I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I> will be murdered: "The child,
abashed, heads for the door. On the threshold, she seems to be torn by
a great inner conflict" ("Sur le seuil, un grand combat para&icirc;t se
livrer en elle")(<I>N</I>,41-42/48). The resonance is reinforced
when Nadja later recalls her kiss with Breton, terming it "a kiss with
a threat in it" (<I>N</I>, 85/98).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the "Manifesto of Surrealism," Breton links the beginning of Surrealist
automatism, in writing and listening, to his encounter with Freud and his
sense of dialogue's importance in psychoanalysis. As he conceptualized
the significance of free and spontaneous speech, Breton's attention
was drawn to the element of a shadow dialogue. "The forms of Surrealist
language adapt themselves best to dialogue. Here two thoughts confront
each other; while one is being delivered, the other is busy with it;
but how is it busy with it?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Automatic listening requires one to listen intensely to silences that
 make for the possibility of a shadow dialogue. But there is a danger in
 such intense opening to dialogue, to listening and to listening through
 silences. For Nadja, transference

<B></B>

turns into utter dependence on Breton, while for Breton transference
is soon struggling with counter-transference. The bodily inscription of
silence in Nadja finds its counterpart in Breton; what is consternation
in her body (and hallucinations recorded through her drawings)
becomes exhaustion, emptiness, migraine. Thus, immediately after his
long encounter with Nadja of 6 October, ending with the midnight walk
in the Tuileries, Breton notes: "<I>October 7</I>. --I have suffered
from a violent headache which, perhaps mistakenly, I attribute to last
night's emotions and also to the effort of attention, of accommodation
which I have had to make. The whole morning, too, I have been bothering
myself about Nadja . . ." ("Toute la matin&eacute;e, pourtant, je me
suis ennuy&eacute; de Nadja. . .") (<I>N</I>, 90/103-4). On this
occasion the pain of his relationship with Nadja does not prevent him
from longing for her, a longing subtly conveyed in the expression "Je
me suis ennuy&eacute;," which in nineteenth-century usage still meant
"I long for you." But such acknowledgements of intermingled longing and
boredom come with a sense of guilt that prompts him to pose the question
of their relationship from Nadja's viewpoint: "How does she regard me,
how does she judge me?" (<I>N</I>, 90/104). That question, in turn, leads
to another passage of marked ambiguity: "When I am near her I am nearer
things which are near her" (<I>N</I>, 90/104). Breton's new relations to
"things which are near her" may be essentially unstable, but at times
they often seem of more interest to him than she herself. That ambiguity
will increasingly be lived through the voice, silence, and intervals
of connection and disconnection. Five days later, on 12 October, on
the day he has received the first of Nadja's drawings, she and Breton
began to walk near the Jardin du Palais Royal; for the first time, Nadja
spontaneously composes what is effectively a pageant for Breton, a mime:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
After dinner, walking around the garden of the Palais Royal, her
dreams seem to have assumed a mythological character I had hitherto not
discerned. With great skill, so that she gives the striking illusion of
reality, she briefly evokes the elusive character of Melusina. Then she
asks me point-blank: "Who killed the Gorgon, tell me, tell." [<I>N</I>,
108/127]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The spontaneity and the character of mime, acting within a texture
of silence, are important to this performance, which represents a
psychological shift for both participants. True, such scenes occur
elsewhere in <I>Nadja</I>, typically when Nadja is being playful. But
this is the only one which abruptly gives way to speech, to voice
displacing silent mime. Nothing of this sort happens later when Nadja
and Breton visit Saint-Germain-en-Laye: "As we walk in front of the
ch&acirc;teau, Nadja says she wants to be Madame de Chevreuse; how
gracefully she conceals her face behind the heavy, nonexistent plume of
her hat!" (<I>N</I>, 108/127). In the earlier scene, instead, Nadja's
insistent voice, "Who killed the Gorgon, tell me, tell," compels Breton
to silence. While Nadja often speaks in soliloquies, Breton's soliloquy
is <I>Nadja</I> and takes place at the level of the construction. As
he wanders through the city, at times paying attention intensely to
Nadja, he comes to admit: "I have more and more difficulty following her
soliloquy, which long silences begin to make unintelligible" (<I>N</I>,
106/125; translation modified). Such silences cannot be translated into
language, and they take place not only between the two protagonists,
but also within them. Is Nadja's "soliloquy" a single monologue

<B></B>

that is interrupted, or many soliloquies originating in different parts
of the psyche? Still, the more pressing problem of translation remains
an inter-subjective one, and it remains linked to the question of the
different temporalities of story and narrative, experience and discourse,
and of how human identity is shaped in language, a question that had
fascinated Breton since his experience in composing <I>The Magnetic
Fields</I>, his first work of automatic writing, penned with Philippe
Soupault in 1919 (published 1920). Silence threatens the possibility of
communication, and raises the spectre that a founding and constitutive
negativity originating in traumatic experience will make it impossible
to construct the traces of events into narrative. Breton is the surviving
witness of a traumatic event, one who continues to marvel at the miracle
that human beings, however intermittently, can communicate with one
another: "How does it happen that thrown together, once and for all, so
far from the earth, in those brief intervals which our marvelous stupor
grants us, we have been able to exchange a few incredibly concordant views
above the smoking debris of old ideas and sempiternal life?" (<I>N</I>,
111/130).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difficulty of traversing the "brief intervals" that lead from
experience to discourse is inherent in human communication. "Perhaps life
needs to be deciphered like a cryptogram," he suggests at one point,
then proceeds to offer an allegory. Imagine a man in a museum at night
who illicitly examines the portrait of a woman: "Secret staircases,
frames from which the paintings quickly slip aside and vanish (giving way

emphasis.) Frames of reference or interpretation, in this account, are
emptied out by the slippage and disappearance of their contents, while
the spectator experiences a radical, vertiginous passivity, a loss of the
self that is a precondition for the intense experience of communicative
understanding ("to exchange a few incredibly concordant views").

Recalling the interval of time which has transpired since the day when
Nadja had told him a story about her degrading experience of being
slapped by a man and the present moment when he is recounting her tale
again, Breton comments: "Perhaps, during the same period, the irreparable
disaster sweeping away a part of herself--and the most humanly defined
part--the disaster of which that day gave me a notion, had gradually
separated me from her" (<I>N</I>, 114/136). "The irreparable disaster"
plainly refers to Nadja's borderline condition and the degradation it will
entail. But Breton's syntax so emphasizes the time that separates the two
acts of narration that one might also think that "the disaster" refers
to that intervening time itself, the temporality of construction. Such
temporality had already been outlined in the earlier "Manifesto of
Surrealism" in the section discussing the role that Surrealist dialogue
played in the writing of <I>Magnetic Fields</I>:

The forms of Surrealist language adapt themselves best to dialogue. Here,
two thoughts confront each other; while one is being delivered, the
other is busy with it; but how is it busy with it? To assume that it
incorporates it within itself would be tantamount to admitting that
there is a time during which it is possible for it to live completely
off that other

<B></B>

thought, which is highly unlikely. And, in fact, the attention it
pays is completely exterior; it has only time enough to approve or
reject--generally reject--with all the consideration of which man is
capable. This mode of language, moreover, does not allow the heart of
the matter to be plumbed. My attention, prey to an entreaty which it
cannot in all decency reject, treats the opposing thought as an enemy;
. . . it puts me in a position to turn it to good advantage in my reply
by distorting them. ["MoS," 34/335-36]

The same time that may yield a breathtaking exchange of "concordant views"
can also lead to distance, loss, "disaster."

But, in principle, comprehension cannot be separate from the exteriority
of time, the very exteriority that Breton has built into the conceptual
and phenomenological foundations of Surrealist dialogue. Recalling
his experience in writing "Barriers," the fifth chapter in <I>Magnetic
Fields</I>, which is made up of passages written alternately by Breton
and Soupault, each in response to the other, Breton writes:

Poetic Surrealism . . . has focused its efforts up to this point
on reestablishing dialogue in its absolute truth, by freeing both
interlocutors from any obligations of politeness. Each of them simply
pursues his soliloquy without trying to derive any special dialectical
pleasure from it and without trying to impose anything whatsoever upon
his neighbor. . . . The words, the images are only so many springboards
for the mind of the listener. ["MoS," 35/336]

This form of communication, in which two styles of thinking confront one
other, especially encourages participants to identify with one another
through affective mimesis; and, if sufficiently sustained, it resembles
the sort of dialogic communication that distinguishes the analytic
situation, and in particular the silent dynamics of the transference,
as the patient reactivates and reenacts his fundamental conflicts
around the re of the analyst. Yet analysis does not conclude
with the transference; it continues by analyzing the transference
through ongoing dialogue between patient and analyst, carried on in
distinct but linked temporalities. Breton had built this temporality
of distance, of the interval, into Surrealist dialogue and theory;
but it is Nadja who compels him to experience it on the pulses in
contexts extending far beyond Surrealist games, or even listening to
the victims of war neuroses. His encounter with Nadja impels him to
conceive of constructing temporalization, rather than deploying it,
when faced with the overwhelming emptiness, the voids, and the echoes
left by his passage with Nadja. The transference, which in its most
primitive form is mimetic identification, has occurred with Nadja, thus
enabling that creative illusion of relationality which is registered
in the work's discourse of double meaning. When Breton asks Nadja the
"one question which sums up all the rest, a question only I would ever
ask, probably," he is startled to hear for the first time "a reply
worthy of it." "'Who are you?' And she, without a moment's hesitation:
'I am the soul in limbo'" (<I>N</I>, 71/82). When Breton gives her a
copy of his book <I>The Lost Steps</I>, she responds, "Lost steps? But
there's no such thing!" (<I>N</I>, 72/83). After reading Jarry's sonnet,
"Among the Heaths" ("Parmi les bruy&egrave;res"), Nadja says, "Oh! That
must be death!" (<I>N</I>, 73/84). Each of these moving utterances points
to an effect of transference, up to the point where the unconscious

<B></B>

would touch upon death. But at the same time, each points to a different
movement of comprehension, and so to a different relationship between
temporality and memory. In constructing the narrative <I>Nadja</I>,
Breton cannot avoid this disjunction, for Nadja is no longer present to
enable him to escape the solitary reliving of their passage through the
city. Her absence makes the time of Surrealism, from its birth, a time
of disaster and negativity.

Silence is linked to various senses of projection in the construction both
of the narrative of <I>Nadja</I> and Nadja's experiences. In a Freudian
context we can link silence to projection by perceiving interior stimuli
(such as hallucinations) as though they have originated from an external
source. In a psychopathological context we can link silence to projection
as a hypnagogic experience which Maury described as an intermediary
state which places one "in the presence of a dissolution or suspension
of thought near to death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Silence makes it possible to take in the various slippages between
 internal apperception and the external stimulation that comprise the
 encoding dimension of discourse. Freud also notes that silence may
 function as a form of transference, yet silence always carries with it a
 close proximity to death: in silence one straddles precipitously between
 the interior processing of an event and the exteriorizing description
 of that event in narrative structure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Such is the function of communication: namely, to channel dynamic
 experience into frozen time. The act of channelling or translating an
 event into a narrative structure is the act of living, in effect, a life
 that becomes split from itself: in silence one must confront both the
 real time of experience and the frozen time of narrative recreation. This
 bifurcated voice of silence has become one of the prominent concepts in
 the Surrealist movement, beginning with the inaugural hypnagogic phrase,
 "There is a man cut in two by the window": once the silence has been
 broken, the voice of a narrator is disembodied ("MoS," 21/325). In the
 opening passage of "In 80 Days," a chapter in <I>Magnetic Fields</I>,
 we can find the concept of the disembodied voice in the iconography of
 bodily displacement in an urban environment: "The sad Sunday suburbs
 and the lines of a local interest are a sad setting. The newly equipped
 traveller who departs with one idea in his brilliant brain surveys
 with his eyes his house, his chimney and the wide avenues leading to
 the town halls. . . . His tread resounds; he is walking over his heart."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Soupault was not the only artist to depict the doubling hypnotic state as
 a lyric displacement of the body articulated through the imagery of the
 banal urban environment. Surrealist painters also used similar allegories
 in both tragic and lyric treatments of the disembodied voice. We can look
 to Max Ernst's <I>Piet&agrave;, ou la r&eacute;volution de la nuit</I>
 , <I>La belle jardini&egrave;re</I> , and the <I>Victoire
 de Samothrace</I> ; and Joan Mir&oacute;'s <I>Musique, Seine,
 Michel, Bataille et moi</I>  for examples of this allegory
 at work. There is also, in the works of Mir&oacute; and Soupault,
 an exploration of diacritical engagement as a threat to the creative,
 spontaneous possibilities that arise when a physical body resides within
 the space of the city. In <I>Musique, Seine, Michel, Bataille et moi</I>,
 Mir&oacute; allows the apperceived

<B></B>

voice to float in circular wanderings, as does the body image of the
traveller in Soupault's "In 80 Days."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their first meeting together, Nadja identifies herself as such a
wandering spirit when Breton asks her "Who are you?" (<I>N</I>, 71/82). In
the English edition Nadja's answer is "I am the soul in limbo," losing
in translation the sense of movement and travel that is implicit in the
French: "Je suis l'&acirc;me errante" ("I am the wandering soul"). In this
early sequence, Nadja embodies the possibility of becoming for Breton
a kindred spirit, who like Breton roams about the city without distinct
purpose or direction: "She was on her way, she claimed, to a hairdresser
on the Boulevard Magenta (I say claimed because she later admitted she
was going nowhere)" (<I>N</I>, 65/73). Such aimless wanderings echo those
Breton describes in the first section of the narrative, where his own
excursions in the city unfold as a response to the question he poses as
the beginning of his book: "Who am I?" Addressing his readers directly,
Breton describes his ambles about the city streets of Paris in search
of himself:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Meanwhile, you can be sure of meeting me in Paris, of not spending more
than three days without seeing me pass, toward the end of the afternoon,
along the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle between the <I>Matin</I> printing
office and the Boulevard de Strasbourg. I don't know why it should be
precisely here that my feet take me, here that I almost invariably go
without specific purpose, without anything to induce me but this obscure
clue: namely that it will happen here. I cannot see, as I hurry along,
what could constitute for me, even without my knowing it, a magnetic
pole in either space or time. [<I>N</I>, 32/36-38]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their first meeting, the city functions as a backdrop for
Breton and Nadja as they seem to discover in each other a potential
for mutual understanding that defies rational knowledge and logical
progression. Breton recollects that "without a moment's hesitation,
I spoke to this unknown woman, though I must admit that I expected the
worst. She smiled, but quite mysteriously and somehow <I>knowingly</I>,
though I had no reason to think so" (<I>N</I>, 64-65/73; emphasis
in the original). Breton does not need to deploy rationality to perceive
that Nadja possesses an intimate understanding of his "whole manner"
of thinking and speaking (<I>N</I>, 71/82). Nadja's knowledge is itself
a projection, for what Breton is most fascinated by when he looks
into Nadja's eyes is not what those eyes might perceive, but what they
reflect when he looks into them: "I took a better look at her. What was
so extraordinary about what was happening in those eyes? What was it
they reflected . . . ?" (<I>N</I>, 65/73). The question of whether or
not the narrator is capable of seeing in Nadja's eyes the capacity for
perception even as she functions as an instrument of self-reflection is
one question that propels this narrative forward.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's play in the city evokes, and draws upon, a comparable and varied
use of projection in both the gestured slowing down of time in her miming
and in her use of comic mimicry: "Nadja, who has thrown a fold of her cape
back over her shoulder, assumes with astonishing facility the arrogance
of the Devil as he appears in romantic prints" (<I>N</I>, 102/120). These
displacements are a function of projection, especially in Nadja's world
"where everything so rapidly assumed the appearance of a rise, a fall"
(<I>N</I>, 135/159).

<B></B>

In such a world as Nadja's, there is a continuity between the pathology
of the forms of play and dissolution; Breton calls these projected forms
her <I>distractions</I>. There is still a sense that Nadja is able to
distinguish between play and displaced absorption when, for example,
she "supposing herself alone . . . was singing and dancing as she walked
beneath an arcade of the Palais Royal" (<I>N</I>, 101/118). Yet in this
scene Nadja begins dangerously to identify herself with a projected
hallucination as she moves within the trajectory of a city that pierces
her to distraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In his account of their sixth meeting in the diary portion of the book,
 Breton recalls one instance of Nadja's dissolution which turns into an
 accusation that he directs towards himself:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We reach the corner of the Rue de Seine, where we turn, Nadja no longer
wishing to continue straight ahead. She is still quite distressed
[<I>distraite</I>, distracted], and tells me to follow a line slowly
traced across the sky by a hand. "Still that hand." She shows it to me,
as a matter of fact, on a poster, a little beyond the Dorbon bookstore. It
so happens that there is, high above us, a red hand with its index finger
pointing, advertising something or other. Nadja insists on touching this
hand . . . which she succeeds in slapping with her own. "The hand of
fire, it's all you, you know, it's you." She falls silent for a while,
I suspect she has tears in her eyes. Then suddenly . . . virtually
stopping me, with that extraordinary way she has of calling me,
the way you might call someone from room to room in an empty castle:
"Andr&eacute;? Andr&eacute;? . . . You will write a novel about me. I'm
sure you will." (<I>N</I>, 100/116-17; first two ellipses mine,
third ellipsis author's]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through Breton's recollection we learn that Nadja must correlate the
hallucinations she projects from inside with the piercing assault
of stimulation that comes in from outside. Likewise Breton the
author struggles to make sense out of his own projection, the
character "Breton," whose life depends upon the movement of the
narrative scene. Who does Nadja call by name when she accusingly says
"Andr&eacute;? Andr&eacute;? . . . You will write a novel about me"? Who
moves within the narrative and who keeps the narrative moving? A silent
voice resides, ghost-like, in the elliptical space that marks the distance
between "Andr&eacute;" and the narrative he will write about Nadja. The
question of narrative form becomes, in the psychopathology of trauma,
a question of life and death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether we refer to the psychopathological researches of Henri Ey,
inflected by his sympathy for Surrealism, or to the contemporary
researches of psychoanalysts such as F&eacute;dida or Schneider, there
is remarkable continuity in the description of the phenomenology of the
experience of effraction and place (<I>lieu</I>) as "the sensible support
(insofar as it is 'lived' by my body) of the sense of these exchanges;
but it disappears under the sense of its sense."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The sense of support, however, is one of the necessary illusions one
 must conjure to cope with the trauma of bifurcated identity. Such
 an understanding of voice in relation to place necessarily bypasses
 a conventional understanding that would confer to voice a phallic,
 dynamic capacity for penetration into an implicitly passive, fixed
 place. As the montage of photographs, song snippets, and juxtapositions
 of recurrent images as both hallucinations and memories suggest, the
 narrative events in <I>Nadja</I> (and indeed, in Nadja) do not just
 happen <I>in</I> the city, they occur through them.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is impossible to articulate the dynamism of place because this
dynamism, this active engagement in real time, cannot be contained
in narrative structure or identity construction. Absence and presence
(in lost real time, in remembered events, in dreams, in projections and
hallucinations) must be understood in terms of correspondence, where
the presence of one image might presuppose the juxtaposition of other
images in all instances of their reoccurrence. The recurring images of
waving hands, fixed handrails, closing eyes, open windows, and hidden
tunnels suggest an "Originary otherness from which one cannot withdraw
oneself, since it is inseparable from the possibility of being alive"
(<I>Pdl'O</I>, 143). In her study of "Claire," Monique Schneider claims
that the question of presence and absence in place cannot be resolved
by positing place as "the invisible posited as the antithetic of the
visible." Rather, place is what makes the emergence of recognizable forms
possible. Place is where correspondences can be drawn between interior
forms and exterior stimuli:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Place could in no way embody the invisible posited as the antithetic of
the visible; it participates in the deployment of the visible, but without
emerging as recognizable form. It could not moreover be confused with
that which is designated as ground; it is situated on the side of the
support, and not on the side of that which is in relief--<I>whence the
matriciel dimension of transporting space</I>; the earth as transporting
place occurs in the prolongation of what can be attributed to <I>shadow
understood as an internal place from</I> which emerges whatever is going
to be brought into relief, or appear on stage. [<I>Pdl'O</I>, 141]

("Matriciel" is a pyschoanalytic term indicating whatever fulfills for
the feminine the function that the phallic fulfils for the masculine; it
indicates a form of causality that is non-symbolic and non-paternal, in
time that is not linear but cyclical, and is situated at the pre-oedipal
level.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Monique Schneider, another mark or emplacement of trauma
can be found in screams and cries: "The scream is as much in complicity
with the effraction of space as with the passionate movement aiming
to essay the erection of a bridge capable of binding together the
banks which glance at the menace of emptiness. Will the scream arrive
at this other bank, in which the gesture awaited on the part of the
other consists?" (<I>Pdl'O</I>, 113). The effraction of identity
finds its middle, bridging term in silence before and after a cry,
an impassioned, pained cry that courses like an arc from beginning to
end in <I>Nadja</I>. Cries and screams incise the tragic experience of
return and repetition as a confrontation with effraction and proximity
to death. Silence is one mark of trauma that cannot be drawn into the
logic of narrative structure directly but which can nevertheless convey
the sense of vertiginous, horrific confrontation with an effraction of
identity that so closely approximates death. Such cries mark events,
enclosing them in an interior or psychic (Breton might claim feminine)
place. The close of the play <I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I>, for
example, culminates in an "unforgettable scream" ("le cri inoubliable")
(<I>N</I>, 49/53)--an event that draws a correspondence between
the non-discursive mark of ineffability in the cry and the head of a
"missing" child whose presence is shockingly revealed in the opening
of a cabinet door: "The child's bloody corpse appears, head downward,
and falls onto the floor" (<I>N</I>, 49/53).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 The vulnerability of

<B></B>

rationality, the fragility of the structures that allow rational, causal
correspondences to be drawn, is showcased in the re of the inverted,
falling head. In another episode, Breton attempts to embrace Nadja but
"suddenly, as I am kissing her, she screams. 'There (pointing to the top
of the window), someone's there. I just saw a head upside down--very
clearly'" (<I>N</I>, 107/126). One of the saddest, most shocking
repetitions of this motif can be found in Breton's anecdote of M. Delouit,
"a story that was so stupid, so melancholy, and so moving" (<I>N</I>,
155/183). M. Delouit is partially aphasic, incapable of remembering
certain things such as numbers and certain proper names. He comes to
rent a room at a hotel and informs the assistant of his condition:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Excuse me, I have no memory at all. If you please, each time I come
in, I'll tell you my name: Monsieur Delouit. And each time you'll tell
me the number of my room."-- "Very well, Monsieur." Soon afterwards, he
returns, and as he passes the desk says: "Monsieur Delouit."--"Number 35,
Monsieur."--"Thank you." A minute later, a man extraordinarily upset,
his clothes covered with mud, bleeding, his face almost not a face
at all, appears at the desk: "Monsieur Delouit." "What do you mean,
Monsieur Delouit? Don't try to put one over on us! Monsieur Delouit
has just gone upstairs!"--"I'm sorry, it's me . . . I've just fallen
out of the window. What's the number of my room, please?" [<I>N</I>,

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fall and presumed screams of M. Delouit are not explicitly described
in the contents of the narrative itself, but are implied by Breton's
judicious use of narrative techniques both within and outside of this
story within a story. The ellipses that frame this account as well as the
dashes and ellipses internal to the story mark the ineffable traces of
trauma on M. Delouit's body and the subsequent effraction or effacement
of his identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tragic effacement of M. Delouit correlates with the thematics of
doubling as mime and mimicry (no less than the problem of identity
in relation to language); the drawing of correspondences enacts a
mechanism of substitution that can ultimately endanger a cohesive sense
of identity. When Nadja mimics Mme. de Chevreuse she ". . . gracefully
. . . conceals her face behind the heavy, nonexistent plume of her
hat!" (<I>N</I>, 108/127). The allure of the face of an actress mimicking
another face is, in such a scene, the allure of Melusine, Medusa, or
the Siren. The 'killing look' is the reflection that one obsessively
seeks out yet must avoid if one is to survive the encounter intact. The
mimicked image and the ineffable cry are traces of inscription, the
sometimes horrifying evidence of an attempt to forge a direct link to what
F&eacute;dida and Schneider have called the feminine (<I>jouissance</I>)
as place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The city landscape is such a place, a backdrop that functions much like
the screen in the analytic situation. The screen (itself a surface of
multiplicities) becomes a protective shield that both the analyst and
the analysand need to sustain the therapeutic dialogue. We can find
the city allegorized as a screen in <I>Nadja</I>, in the chapter of
<I>Magnetic Fields</I> which is titled "In 80 Days," in Louis Aragon's
novel <I>Paris Peasant</I>, as well as in Desnos's <I>Liberty or Love</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Surrealist painters such as Mir&oacute; (<I>Musique, Seine, Michel,
 Battaille et moi</I>) and Man Ray (<I>L'&eacute;toile de mer</I>)
 also allegorize the city as the

<B></B>

backdrop that makes it possible for its inhabitants to sustain their
necessary illusions. Nadja's body, whether extended to the drawings or
situated in the city, navigates along the fault line between dynamic
interior stimuli and exterior excitation. The distance between Nadja
and Breton, as well as the disjunction between the two characters
and the city they inhabit, is the mark of their effraction. Nadja's
interactions with the city are increasingly pathological close calls
with city emplacement as <I>jouissance</I>; observing "that hand on the
Seine" across the sky (<I>N</I>, 85/98), she threatens to tear away the
very screen that protects her freedom of movement. She is in danger
of immobilizing herself by staring directly into the face of Medusa,
that is, by seeing herself as nothing more than a character that has
been frozen into the logic of narrative space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The photograph of the wax model from the Mus&eacute;e Grevin suggests the
dangers inherent in the enactment of mimetic substitution by correlating
emplacement with <I>jouissance</I>. Breton included this photograph in
the 1963 edition of <I>Nadja</I> and described it as ". . . an adorable
wax-work re in the Mus&eacute;e Grevin . . . a woman fastening her
garter in the shadows, and it is the only statue I know of with eyes,
the eyes of provocation" (<I>N</I>, 152/177-79). Importantly, the
photograph of the wax re found in <I>Nadja</I> is cropped in such a
way that our attention is drawn not to the re's adorable "eyes of
provocation" but towards two busy, fastening hands that are fumbling
with a garter. The "eyes of provocation" that have gone missing from
the photograph of the wax re correlate implicitly and uncannily
with Breton's description of Nadja's "fern-colored eyes" (<I>N</I>,
111/130), while the garter directly recalls the character Solange in
<I>Les D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I> as she lifts her skirt, "revealing a
beautiful leg . . . a little above the black garter" (<I>N</I>, 45/49),
the role played by Blanche Derval, "the <I>only</I> actress of the period"
(<I>N</I>, 49/55; emphasis in original).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's own city play can be correlated to trauma as is red by Pierre
F&eacute;dida, who provides a phenomenological account of analytic
experience in the context of the psychopathology of <I>informe</I>
conditions: "It is clear that every effraction of the protective
shield--every perforation of the separating membrane protecting the
inside from the outside, which brings about a linkage of the two--is,
in the first instance, the basic sense of traumatic experience."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Breton conveys Nadja's experience of the outside by shrouding the
 sequence of events in ambiguity. The narrator forges a sense of
 continuity by presenting events not in chronological order but
 through repetition and through correlation. For example, Nadja's
 rejoinder that she "no longer wish[es] to continue straight ahead"
 ("r&eacute;sistant &agrave; aller plus loin") (<I>N</I>, 100/116) echoes
 an earlier meeting with Breton where Nadja, refuses "to go any further"
 ("d'aller plus loin"):

As we walk along the quais, I feel that Nadja is trembling all
over. . . . She is very abandoned in her behavior, very sure of me. But
she is looking for something, she insists that we walk into a courtyard,
a courtyard of some police station, which she rapidly explores. "It's
not here. . . . Listen, tell me why you have to go to prison? What is
it you're going to do? I've been to prison too. Who was I? It was ages

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">


In this passage Nadja ushers Breton into a courtyard and asks him "tell me
why you have to go to prison? What is it you're going to do?" Breton uses
Nadja's accusation to foreshadow his responsibility (as author) for her
subsequent disappearance. Nadja's question "Who was I?" is anything but
rhetorical when we consider the scene as a staged confrontation between
Breton the author and Breton as character/projection. The protective
screen that allows this confrontation to take place also turns Nadja into
an agent who, in turn, becomes a medium for Breton, though each permits
this to happen unconsciously. The possibility that Nadja and Breton might
forge a reciprocal understanding of each other as co-inhabitants of the
same city landscape is thus foreclosed; Breton turns Nadja's insistence
that they stop moving forward into an occasion to interrogate, via Nadja's
questions of identity, his own success or failure at producing a reliable
translation of true events. Thus, the authenticity of Breton's narrative
is guaranteed through his disclaimer that Nadja is, or was, a living
person whose presence can be felt in those textual aporias that have,
in psychoanalytic discourse, been closely correlated with death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nadja's close proximity to death is also correlated with her fear
of abandonment, red as the threat of free-falling, uncontrolled
motion. Before she and Breton visit the courtyard that becomes the scene
that foreshadows the crime of her disappearance, Nadja describes the sense
of vertigo she felt when surveying a high window from the perspective
of another high window. She echoes the sense of dislocation invoked
in the hypnogogic phrase, "There is a man cut in two by the window,"
that features in the "Manifesto of Surrealism" ("MoS," 21/325): "'It
was there, from a window in the H&ocirc;tel Henri IV, and my friend, the
second man I told you about, was about to leave. And there was a voice

but I felt so dizzy. . . . I'd certainly have fallen if he hadn't held
me back'" (<I>N</I>, 84/97; ellipsis in original). The unnamed man who
"held her back" is replaced, in the following passage, by Breton, a man
with whom Nadja refuses to move forward until she has surveyed, to her
satisfaction, a low-lying window that overlooks a moat:

Now we are walking along the iron grill railing again, when suddenly
Nadja refuses to go any further. Here on the right, is a low window that
overlooks the moat, and she cannot take her eyes off it. It is in front
of this window which looks so forlorn that we must wait, she knows that
much. It is from here that everything can come. It is here that everything
begins. She holds on to the railing with both hands so that I will not
pull her away. She virtually stops answering my questions. . . . She has
not forgotten about the underground tunnel and probably imagines she
is at one of its exits. She wonders who she might have been, in Marie
Antoinette's circle. The footsteps of passers-by make her shudder for
a long time. [<I>N</I>, 84-85/97-98]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The window overlooking a great divide is a pivotal allegory of bifurcated
identity in the narrative that grants Nadja, in <I>Nadja</I>, her
identity. But like the dislocating and vertiginous heights of a window,
this fragile identity is itself dislocated from its own surroundings. The
footsteps of nameless, faceless passers-by invoke for Nadja a horror
that time can march on without her. Yet who or what is responsible for
Nadja's increasingly

<B></B>

 disjunctive and fragile state? She implicates Breton himself during their
 third encounter, where "She seems to be suffering from a certain inner
 conflict, but suddenly she surrenders, closes her eyes for good, offers
 me her lips. . . . Now she tells me of my power over her, of my faculty
 for making her think and do whatever I desire, perhaps more than I think
 I desire. Because of this, she begs me to do nothing against her. She
 feels she has never had any secrets from me, long before knowing me"
 (<I>N</I>, 79/92; ellipsis in original). Breton makes his own authorial
 anxiety and sense of guilty remorse a feature of these scenes, for it
 is when Nadja most emphatically implores Breton to stop moving that
 the narrative drives relentlessly forward. When Nadja stops moving,
 Breton explores the duality of identity at the core of the question of
 communication. The questions "Who were you?" and "Who am I?" recriminate
 a culpable author residing outside of the narrative space. Ironically,
 the recrimination is like a certificate of authenticity beguiling the
 reader into believing that the story of <I>Nadja</I> is a story <I>sans
 artifice</I>. When the story invokes the fluid temporality of dynamic
 events, the problem of voice becomes not only the problem of translation
 but the problem of ventriloquism ("She tells me of my power over her").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As F&eacute;dida suggested in his analysis of trauma, the successful
communicative exchange involves a sacrifice, namely, the fixing of the
dynamic movement of events within the frozen time of narrative. And as we
have seen earlier, Nadja's talent for mime and mimicry makes clear that
her body must necessarily be subordinated to the narrative voice--even as
this body, as corpse or as corpus, provides the grounds or place through
which this narrative voice might speak. The problem of projection
becomes, in the construction of the narrative, a ventriloquist's
act. Such ventriloquism shadows the movement of the analytic dialogue,
where projection is used to identify (and thereby contain) the trace or
memory of trauma. When the narrator claims that the real Nadja once said
"You will write a novel about me. . . . You have to," Breton the author
is acknowledging the necessity for using Nadja's voice, through Nadja
the character or projection, to suture himself back together again. Yet
Breton also realizes that in his recollections what he captures or
contains is never the biographical person behind the name Nadja, but
the complex projection that he needs to maintain his own variety of
necessary illusions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During their meeting of 10 October Nadja identifies Andr&eacute; as the
man who will have a hand in her undoing (and subsequent literary redoing
when she claims that he will one day write a novel about her). The reality
of the author's story is confirmed in a broken exchange, but only, as we
have seen before, by casting a long shadow of doubt over the stability
of the narrator's sanity as well. Breton the author carefully explores
the anguish that motivates Breton the character to justify his chronic
storytelling, via Nadja's tacit blessing that he must write a novel about
her. Breton's anguish continues to register through Nadja long after she
is gone; the literary marks of silence (the ellipses, the dashes, the
caesuras) voice those questions that Nadja can no longer ask directly:
whose story is being told? for whom is this story being told? and what
is necessarily missing?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton and Nadja begin their romantic exchange full of the possibility
offered by the dynamic landscape of the city. But as Breton realizes that
he is incapable of loving Nadja the way he believes she needs him to love
her, Nadja is increasingly absorbed into the fabric of city space. The
temporary fascination that draws Breton to Nadja is no match for the
permanent power that yokes Nadja to Breton: "How does she regard me,
how does she judge me? It is unforgivable of me to go on seeing her
if I do not love her. Don't I love her? . . . In her condition, she is
certainly going to need me, one way or another, and suddenly" (<I>N</I>,
90/104). For Breton, the city landscape continues to function as a
backdrop and as a screen, providing him with the cover he needs to sustain
the necessary illusions that drive the otherwise disjunctive narrative
forward. Breton's narrative ends with allusions to the technologies of
escape, to planes, trains and automobiles. But as Nadja's fate unfolds,
her range of motion is increasingly constricted and finally ends in
the confinement of a lunatic asylum. Nadja too is like the landscape of
the city, a screen upon which the main players will enact their drama
of identification vis &agrave; vis her embodiment of that necessary,
distancing silence. In the literary space of <I>Nadja</I>, the interaction
takes place within the traumatized, bifurcated identity of Breton himself
as he faces the repercussions of creating a story <I>sans artifice</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passivity characteristic of <I>Nadja</I>'s construction is a
device through which Breton, though now separate from her in time and
place and yet still traumatized by the "irreparable disaster" that has
overtaken her, seeks to encounter Nadja herself, or Nadja as she might
have been. The effects of his experience with her continue to leave
their mark on the writing of <I>Nadja</I>, and it is only in the act of
writing that he begins to understand her. It is as if Nadja's madness,
her borderline state, is her insight into the mechanizations that lie
beyond the confines of her own frozen, atemporal world; the narrative
must move on, even though she continues to hope that something will
remain of her experience shared with Breton.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anonymous footsteps march ahead; the particulars of time and place
are, Nadja recognizes, in themselves immaterial. The French play on
"pas," meaning both "footsteps" and "not" is lost in translation in
the English edition. In the French, the step that is taken can suggest
the foreclosure of all other possibilities of movement: a journey as a
narrowing down of possibilities. The anonymous footsteps remind Nadja
not only that time moves on without her, but that she herself may one
day become a voided and anonymous "not" (or "has-been"). Breton's guilt
in this scene is doubly correlated to Nadja's tragicomic mourning ritual:
he knows that Nadja is doomed in her "madness" to remain, in <I>Nadja</I>,
an embodiment of projection. She may be removed from the narrative scene,
but Nadja will never entirely disappear. She is doomed to remain in a
perpetual free fall towards death. We can find traces of Nadja in the
textual marks of silence that return us to the problem of construction
and to the enigma, <I>Qui vive?</I> ("Who lives?") (<I>N</I>, 144/172):

By insisting that Breton must write a novel because "'everything fades,

the narrator's authorial power to reconstruct a journey that begins
with the question "Who am I?" But even as the narrator invokes, in the
book's final section, technologies that facilitate movement and travel,
Breton's journey is suspended by a question that must elude his powers
of recollection. In the textual marks of silence, in trauma, there is a
persistent enigma "neither static nor dynamic" (<I>N</I>, 160/190) that
eludes both death and the freeze of narrative time; namely, the question:
"Who was <I>she</I>?"

When we experience a transition from consciousness to expression or
from perception to consciousness, a radical failure of symbolization
such as silence can seemingly turn the body into the only available
medium for responding to the world or perceiving it, at least in
psychopathological conditions. The unforgettable scream in <I>Les
D&eacute;traqu&eacute;es</I>, Nadja's trembling, or her sense of being
observed from behind (the latter two common schizophrenic symptoms)
capture this sense of alienation and emptiness. Both Nadja and Breton
experience the dislocating bifurcation of identity that is concomitant
with traumatic experience, but they do not share the same experience
or sense of temporality. While Nadja straddles between the world of
dynamic events and the realm of frozen time characteristic of narrative
structure, Breton experiences a temporality that is related to, yet
never wholly coincides with, hers. Yet the "concordant views," those
rare but breathtaking possibilities of communicative exchange evoked
by Breton, occur only in the negativity of just such moments, those
intervals that are also the basis of temporality in narrative/identity
construction. To better understand Breton's invocation of such
possibilities for communicative exchange or dialogue, we can look to his
use of photographs and song fragments in <I>Nadja</I>, devices related to
a motif of enigmatic traces that is discernible not only in <I>Nadja</I>
but throughout Breton's oeuvre, beginning with "The Unsilvered Mirror"
and "Seasons," the first two chapters in <I>Magnetic Fields</I> .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most telling critical responses to <I>Nadja</I> have been those of
Maurice Blanchot and Michel Beaujour.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Blanchot's essay has been less influential among art historians,
 while key themes and terms from Beaujour's essay have influenced both
 art historians and literary critics, especially his arguments about
 classifying the photographs and more generally the role of photography
 within <I>Nadja.</I> Breton, in order to construct a

<B></B>

story <I>sans artifice</I>, that is, a work intended not to be a novel
(<I>romanesque</I>), deploys a procedure of modal patterning that groups
smaller anecdotes into larger structures which, as they aggregate,
develop into coherent and cohesive patterns. An organizational structure
similar to that of retinal memory develops, despite self-evident
discontinuities. Such structures suggest the "existence of a network
wherein each element, by its proximity to another one, takes up and
confirms the authenticity both of the other elements surrounding it
and of the system as a whole" ("QqN," 785). As new elements become
attached to this montage, the illusion that these fixed images continue
to correspond to the lost continuous time of real events is created to
"bring about multiple regroupings. This is the role which has devolved
to the forty-seven photographs of the revised edition"("QqN," 785).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beaujour's comments have been modified by those of Arrouye and Ades. Jean
Arrouye's study of photography in <I>Nadja</I> recognizes certain
trans-iconic themes which are disclosed through the photographs: the
themes of what he calls "the regard" and "departure," both subsumed in a
broader theme of "recommencement." For Arrouye, the photographs function
as "an activator of the imaginary" in <I>Nadja</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Dawn Ades describes the non-literary function of the photographs which
 record the irrational nature of events in <I>Nadja</I>. She especially
 focuses on the almost complete absence of people in the photographs
 depicting the city. "At the risk of overdetermining these images,"
 she urges, "I think that the avoidance of the bustle of human activity
 and city life is deliberate and relates to a preoccupation referred
 to on the cover of the fourth issue of <I>La R&eacute;volution
 surr&eacute;aliste</I>, which bore the photograph of a mannequin
 ascending a curved staircase. The caption runs: 'And War on Work.' What
 was implied there is stated clearly in <I>Nadja</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 But much earlier than the "War on Work" is Breton's fascination with De
 Chirico's empty squares, above all <I>The Engima of a Day</I> . We
 can find a conspicuous nod to the empty squares motif already in the
 first photograph to appear in the book, a statue of Rousseau standing
 before the H&ocirc;tel des Grands Hommes, its sharp relief accentuating
 the flat grid of windows behind it. Another model for the diction of
 emptiness in <I>Nadja</I>'s photographs are the haunting pictures of
 <I>Vieux Paris</I> taken by Atget, some of which were published in the
 journal <I>La Revolution surr&eacute;aliste</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton's notorious distaste for work or labor does indeed find expression
in <I>Nadja</I>, as Ades argues, but it is not in the photographs. They,
instead, engage the question of absence, and do so in relation to
issues of voice and the problem of place as it appears in the narrative
construction. There can be no conception of place, whether in metaphysics,
phenomenology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis or deconstructive reflection,
that is separable from a conception of memory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 This is especially true for a notion of psychic or an interior sense
 of place, which inevitably depends on a notion of the past as the trace
 of experience, as memories which are lodged in the unconscious. Breton
 explicitly links memory to the way anachronic traces are structured in
 psychic or interior space; the fragility of this link between memory
 and psychic place is one of the organizing themes that give rise to the
 narrative structure of <I>Nadja</I> as a series of repetitious events
 and correlating, juxtaposing images.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was partly as a consequence of his view of memory that Breton shared
the skepticism toward photography that was common in the culture of
Surrealism. The title of Mir&oacute;'s painting, <I>Photo: ceci est la
couleur de mes r&ecirc;ves</I>  (<I>Photograph: This is the Color
of My Dreams</I>), wittily dismisses photography in a manner which Breton
would easily have endorsed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Photography, it says, cannot capture the color of dreams. Similarly,
 when discussing Man Ray, Breton would reflect: "The photographic
 print, considered in isolation, is certainly permeated with an
 emotive value that makes it a supremely precious article of exchange
 . . . nevertheless, despite the fact that it is endowed with a special
 power of suggestion, it is not in the final analysis the <I>faithful</I>
 image that we aim to retain of something that will soon be gone for
 ever."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Photography, in short, cannot fulfill the functions of memory. No
 photograph could capture, for example, the "low window that overlooks
 the moat" which so absorbs Nadja's attention that she "cannot take
 her eyes off" it (<I>N</I>, 84/97). No photograph could reproduce the
 hallucination she experiences in the Place Dauphine, "Where only two or
 three couples are at this moment fading into the darkness, she seems to
 see a crowd. 'And the dead, the dead!'" (<I>N</I>, 83/94-96). Nor
 did Breton's mistrust of the medium hinge on the difference between
 straight (or realistic) and experimental photography, at least if we
 understand the latter to mean adopting procedures that foreground the
 unmotivated nature of the sign. For such procedures would be irrelevant
 for <I>Nadja</I>, since movement in its narrative is always motivated,
 as is any psychic movement that is matriciel. For this reason, signs
 that mark the transition from interiority to exteriority or vice versa,
 including voice, cannot be merely a function of a discursive field;
 instead they mark the very limit of the discursive, even call for its
 reconration. The motivated nature of the sign entails a relation to
 memory, however tacit or unconscious, one that conjoins the orders of the
 audible (voice) and the visual (the photographs) insofar as both negate
 the discursive and stand on the brink of its reconration. The trace
 or mark looks forward, one might say, to an object or event that is about
 to happen (the reconration of discourse), even while it registers the
 sense of risk experienced and relived in memory, through construction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton was strongly attracted to the idea that dreams epitomized a world
of pure continuity, conceiving of them much as Lacan later defined the
Real, or that which lies outside the symbolic process, when he wrote that
"The Real is without fissures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Memory, in contrast, is a violation of such continuity, a form of
 negativity not unlike death. As Breton writes in the "Manifesto of
 Surrealism": "In the limits where they operate (or are thought to
 operate) dreams give every evidence of being continuous and show signs of
 organization. Memory alone arrogates to itself the right to excerpt from
 dreams, to ignore the transitions, and to depict for us rather a series
 of dreams than the <I>dream itself"</I> ("MoS," 11/317). Surrealism,
 instead, introduces its practitioners into the secret society of death:
 "It will glove your hand, burying therein the profound M with which
 the word Memory begins" ("MoS," 32/334), alluding to the French word
 for death, <I>la mort</I>. Earlier in his "Carnets," when speculating
 on memory, observation, and imagination and their relation to past,
 present, and future, Breton envisages the possibility that memory might
 be conceived as a function of imagination and

<B></B>

the future, a viewpoint which would turn the present into an evanescent
point: "Substitution doesn't even exist, why. Negation of death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Such a notion would effectively dissever time from any sense
 of direction; the present instead would belong to the order and
 experience of place (a point), one which would admit no sense of movement
 either toward or away from. Memory, seen in this light, would become a
 non-temporal place (<I>lieu anachronique</I>), while death would become a
 non-temporalizing event (<I>&eacute;v&eacute;nement anachronique</I>). It
 is between place and event that the photographs of <I>Nadja</I> occur.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shortly after Breton raises the possibility that people might "exchange a
few incredibly concordant views above the smoking debris of old ideas"
(<I>N</I>, 111/130), and shortly after he senses "the irreparable
disaster" that is engulfing Nadja (<I>N</I>, 114/136), he resolves that
he will persist in his effort of recuperation and reparation vis &agrave;
vis Nadja, but pursue a different strategy:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It would be futile to multiply here instances of unusual happenings
which apparently concern only the two of us and dispose me, for the most
part, in favor of a certain finalism which might permit us to explain
the particularity of anything, happenings, I say, of which Nadja and I
have been the simultaneous witnesses or of which only one of us has been
the witness. I no longer wish to remember, as the days go by, any but a
few of her sentences, spoken or written spontaneously in my presence,
sentences in which I best recapture the tone of her voice and whose
resonance remains so great within me. [<I>N</I>, 115/137]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Breton goes on to record nine sentences, but the first two are especially
pertinent: "'With the end of my breath, which is the beginning of yours'"
(<I>N</I>, 115/137); and "'If you wish, for you I would be nothing, or
merely a trace'" (<I>N</I>, 116/137; translation modified). These maxims
fall within the understanding of Lacan's <I>la parole fondatrice,</I>
that use of dialogue which hinges on the movement of pronouns as the
medium of subjective repositionings whereby the participants are changed
by virtue of their participation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But they also open up another possibility. Breton, when he recounts
 the story of his rapport with Nadja, consistently notes that their
 mutual but distinct temporalities remain in a shadow dialogue with each
 other. His decision to persist in his pursuit of Nadja, "quite beyond
 any question of luck" (<I>N</I>, 91/105) and quite beyond anecdote or
 story into mere transcription of her aphorisms, is a logical extension
 of the way in which the narrative construction has recorded the effects
 of negativity. Consider such phrasing as "the tone of her voice," its
 "resonance . . . within me," "the end of my breath," or "a trace"
 (<I>N</I>, 115-16/137). These capture a growing sense of the
 tenuous and insubstantial, while simultaneously offering a promise of
 life, the hope that people can communicate "concordant views" despite
 the gaps that divide them. Each phrase, too, captures the sense of an
 experience in negative ("end of my breath," or to be "nothing, or merely
 a trace"). Placed in their perlocutionary context, however, where the
 narrator uses them like a gesture to summon up Nadja's presence, the
 aphorisms become quasi-silent counterparts to the photographs; in them,
 memory functions as a non-temporal place (<I>lieu anachronique</I>),
 just as the song fragments will function as a form of death, a
 non-temporalizing event (<I>&eacute;v&eacute;nement anachronique</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are many moments in <I>Nadja</I> that allude to Breton's earlier
prose poem, "Soluble Fish," or which echo its sonorities. The most
dramatic occurs on 6 October, a little prior to Nadja's "distractions"
or hallucinations. Heading for the Rue Dauphine, Nadja and Breton wander
instead into the Place Dauphine, "where," Breton goes on to explain,
"curiously enough, another episode of 'Soluble Fish' occurs: 'A kiss is
so quickly forgotten'" (<I>N</I>, 80/93).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Breton is alluding to section 24 of "Soluble Fish," in which lyrical
 evocations of a day are woven round the refrain to a forgotten
 popular song, "A Kiss Is So Quickly Forgotten." The allusion creates
 a vertiginous montage of memories. Breton is carried away from Nadja
 and the Place Dauphine to an episode in "Soluble Fish," but it is
 never clear whether he has made a simple allusion to a <I>literary</I>
 work or whether, indeed, one experience has connected with another,
 with the memory of the "lady friend" ("mon amie") in "Soluble Fish"
 who "speaks in aphorisms" like those of the later Nadja.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Section 24 of "Soluble Fish" contains several registers of fragmentation,
 and each is linked with a mode of presenting the feminine in a way that
 recalls the presentation of song fragments in Picasso's hermetic Cubism:
 the speech of the beloved in sententious form; a song fragment that
 is the refrain for a song which is never named; or the dissolution of
 song into water, "so that in the morning all that was left of us was
 that song . . . that lapped a bit of night water in the center of the
 square" ("SF," 87/380). The dissolution of song into water turns into
 the movement of water in defined forms: "We passed by unnoticed by
 the curves down there, sinusoids, parabolas, geysers, rains" ("SF,"
 88/380), leading to the final presentation of the body via metonymy,
 faces and hands that persist amid the disappearance or effacement of
 interacting bodies since: "We in turn put on the garments of pure air"
 ("SF," 88/381). The movement of memory begun cannot stop here, not
 least because it opens onto another dimension of experiencing the
 feminine. The recounting voice of "Soluble Fish" declares: "My eyes
 were the flower of a hazel tree, my right eye the male flower, my left
 the female flower" ("SF," 87/381). That passage is plainly echoed in
 <I>Nadja</I> when Breton discusses <I>The Lovers' Flower</I>, Nadja's
 drawing which depicts an intertwining pair of eyes: it was "essentially
 under this sign that the time we spent together should be placed"
 (<I>N</I>, 116/140). Such imagery and diction is overdetermined in a
 way that would have disposed Breton to <I>feel</I> such transpositions
 as significant; after all, at the close of "The Unsilvered Mirror"
 (chapter one of <I>Magnetic Fields</I>) he had envisaged "plants of
 the greatest beauty, male rather than female and often both at once"
 (<I>MF</I>, 30/33). Elsewhere in <I>Magnetic Fields</I> moments of
 plenitude are rendered in terms that link the register of the audible
 with a sense of the body being suffused, as in the following passage
 from "Seasons": "The elephant tusks lean on the star-rise steps so
 that the princess can descend and the bands of musicians step out of
 the sea. There is nobody but me now on this sonorous scale-platform,
 the equivocal wavering of which is my harmony. Ah! to descend with
 one's hair down and limbs in disarray in the whiteness of the rapids"
 (<I>MF</I>, 36/39-40). The sustained development of the register
 of the audible--of intensive focal listening, a passivity in which
 sound approaches its own spatiality as touching upon, becoming one with
 space--goes together with the kind of fragmentary movement in image
 clusters which characterizes automatic writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Thus,

<B></B>

again in "Seasons," we are told: "I have so much sand in my ears,
moreover, that I do not know how I shall learn your language" (<I>MF</I>,
37). In such listening (<I>l'&eacute;coute automatique</I>), in which
attention hovers uneasily between inside and outside and objects of
thought are rendered indistinct, the tendency to fragmentation not
only preempts the presentation of whole objects, it tends to make the
object pulse, blink, fold, peek, and dematerialize into waves, rhythms,
or intervals which are encircled by sonorous auras. The subject of
attention, meanwhile, is returned to the matriciel dimension of place in
which time is essentially cyclical, so questioning the phallic dimension
of spatiality. Or as Rousseau put it, recalling the dear old nurse who
had attended his birth, "The hands which opened my eyes at birth will
be able to close them for me at death" ("Les mains qui m'ouvrirent les
yeux. . .").
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

Rousseau's thought bears on the song fragment and the status of
recollection in <I>Nadja</I>. Breton begins one of the unpublished
divisions of "Soluble Fish": "A memory doubtless the first and the one
that prompted the stars to flower, to open their hands" (". . . fleurir
les astres, ouvrir les mains)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The text evokes tones that recall Lacan's Imaginary order, one of
 mirror-images, identifications, and reciprocities, with images of
 shadowed deflections that make up the elements and part-objects of
 fantasy and instinct, especially in the juxtaposition of delight and
 threat. Deploying diction that echoes the ending of "The Unsilvered
 Mirror" in <I>Magnetic Fields</I>, a scene in which children's frenzied
 activity is calmed by gentle erotic hypnotism, the text of "Soluble Fish
 [II]" describes a psychic state in which: "The appetites are calmed by
 struggles, the anxieties the doors under which slips a serpent. This
 memory, pacified, bruised, worked like an iron grill, sometimes cedes
 its place to a pellet of poison" ("SF [II]," 515). Those who solicit
 this memory "are big. But the garden of persecutions closes its gates
 on them and they remain trapped by hosts with spider feet" ("SF [II],"
 515). The texture of the work of memory--an iron grill--calls to and
 transposes the presence of water emblematic of the interior life:
 "Sheet of water that the interior life, devoted to traces and to
 calls of moving sand" ("SF [II]," 516). It is in this register that
 the most telling aspect of the realm of imaginary identifications in
 Breton's sensibility is presented. For the ensuing equivocations not
 only dramatize the anachronic or timeless aspect of the unconscious and
 make clear the implicit relation between the emergence of temporality
 and the feminine in experience; they stage <I>thinking in relation to
 the feminine</I> as something inescapable, a state of enchantment and
 hypnotic fascination. Thus, in a scene that works under the form of a
 metonymic presentation of tears and joyous melancholy, we come upon:
 "But a female silhouette inscribed in heart-rain, an encirclement of
 butterflies in a thought, there it is, which detours the forked time
 of our pedestals of white frost" ("SF [II]," 516). The obliquity of
 the "female silhouette" ("silhouette de femme") presages a structure
 of shadows. In another section of the unpublished "Soluble Fish," one
 which presents a Judgment of Paris scene and begins, "You are a shadow,
 nothing but a shadow that is descending from a bell tower" ("SF [II],"
 552) the text urges that "there is also a strange rain that resembles
 death" ("SF [II]," 553). Time, in this passage, is encompassed along
 with memory and light and the shapes identified in Breton's conception
 with thinking, above all, the

<B></B>

curve such as in the earlier poem "Sunflower": "Had I business with the
ambassadress of saltpeter / Or the white curve on the black background
we call thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 In the following passage from "Soluble Fish," it is the movement of
 light, water, and shadow in relation to memory and temporality that is
 telling: "Through pierced towers, under the wing of vegetal flags which
 signal nature's barrack to the humans in transit, subsequent to spaces
 and by the force of things, the shadow regains somewhat the terrain that
 we had made it yield" ("SF [II]," 516). The prepositional structure
 of this passage ("Through . . . under . . . subsequent to . . .";
 "Au travers . . . sous . . . par la suite . . .") not only textures
 the movement, but also shapes the structure of shadow extending from
 the "female silhouette" to the "vegetal flags," from "spaces" into
 "the shadow [that] regains somewhat the terrain that we had made it
 yield." The prose poem closes by personifying memory, which now appears
 partly as projective identification, partly as waiting, and partly
 as desire and anticipated loss: "It is in this wasteland that I await
 memory maddened from all the rendez-vous to be had on the surface of
 the earth. A beam dances on the crystal molehill and from this molehill
 memory issues like a sheaf of irises, for the greatest satisfaction of
 the senses crumpled before opening up like gravestones" ("SF [II],"
 516). Memory, in this view, comes from a mixture of light ("a beam")
 and darkness ("a molehill"), a mixture which is given texture and volume
 ("des sens chifonn&eacute;s," or "some rumpled meanings") ("SF [II],"
 516) and hence an element of the timelessness of the unconscious
 (<I>anachronique</I>). In another section of "Soluble Fish [II],"
 the relationship between memory and death which Breton perceived is
 suggested by evoking ephemerality: "You have not the sombre air of
 reason in your brilliant closing, beautiful as the root of passions,
 you do not know why ardor comes to light. You are the only bird for
 each one of us, the bird which throws itself into the assault of the
 precipice and which must live but for an hour" ("SF [II]," 553).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Breton, as I have argued, conceived of memory as a place, and place
as feminine, then it should come as no surprise that certain places,
especially those most connected with Nadja or most evocative of "Soluble
Fish" (the work which most directly explores the texture of the maternal),
should prompt ambivalent reactions on his part. When he accidentally
wanders into the Place Dauphine he comments: "The Place Dauphine is
certainly one of the most profoundly secluded places I know of, one of
the worst wastelands in Paris. Whenever I happen to be there, I feel the
desire to go somewhere else gradually ebbing out of me, I have to struggle
against myself to get free from a gentle, over-insistent, and, finally,
crushing embrace" (<I>N</I>, 80/93). Here we recognise the register of
panic prompted by the texture of the maternal, a texture that subtly
evokes the threat associated with the Sirens, that of immobilization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The intricate patterns of metonymy and synechdoche in <I>Nadja</I> point
to a notion of the feminine which is linked to cyclical temporality. We
have explored several forms of encirclement, cyclic return, and frozen
time in <I>Nadja</I>, including the tragic repetition compulsion of
Solange, a circular form psychosis; M. Delouit's more pathetic compulsion
to enact repeatedly his own effacement; the many song fragments (nursery
rhymes or chansons); the urban wandering of Nadja and Breton, or Breton's
own return to the places haunted by Nadja; and, at the comic level,
Brenton's account of the film <I>The</I> 

<B></B>


<I>Grip of the Octopus</I>, in which "a Chinese who had found
some way to multiply himself invaded New York by means of several
million self-reproductions," a work "which has affected me far more
than any other" (<I>N</I>, 32, 37/38). The image of Solange's skirt
"revealing a beautiful leg" (<I>N</I>, 45/49) in a frozen time is but
one expression of the <I>jouissance</I> which is linked to psychosis,
the <I>troubles de la pens&eacute;e</I> ("mental troubles") of Solange,
and the "crushing embrace" of the Place Dauphine. The grounding support
for these encirclings is the city, but the city conceived as maternal
imago. The city as feminine place acts as a protective or supporting
screen, enabling Breton to reconstruct an identity of sorts in his
confrontation with the effracting voice of trauma. Throughout "Soluble
Fish," the relationship between thinking and the substance of the feminine
is imagined as the interplay of light and shadow, while death is linked
to the primitive, archaic memory of the womb. The material is nearly
always linked to emergence and to place.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 It is well known that Breton did not care for music; but he shared
 with Val&eacute;ry a profound sense of the music of poetry, for what
 we hear in <I>Nadja</I> and its fragments is a highly chromatic music
 of the pathos of place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The kind of memory which is triggered by the song fragments moves
uneasily between the reorganization of a past characteristic of
<I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I>, that sort of retrospective interpretation
which stabilizes the past, and the unorganized timelessness which is the
<I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> of the unconscious. That oscillation
continues all the way to the end of the book, crystalized in the image
of the falling bridge and the nursery rhyme "Sur le pont d'Avignon"
to which Breton makes oblique reference (<I>N</I>, 154/182).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 When we see the extent to which identity, effraction, temporality,
 and death have been situated within <I>la substance du corp
 f&eacute;minin</I> (the substance of the female body), we can more fully
 appreciate the degree to which the canonic definition of Surrealism as
 "automatisme psychique pur" ("pure psychic automatism," "MoS," 26/328)
 has been shaped by that key category of nineteenth-century psychiatry
 in France, <I>troubles de la pens&eacute;e</I>, a term that covered
 general failures of attention. The pathology of <I>troubles de la
 pens&eacute;e</I> was always gendered feminine. In part of that move
 in which essentially Symbolist concerns are reinscribed within Freudian
 terms, Surrealism rejects the ideology behind the category <I>troubles
 de la pens&eacute;e</I>. But with Freud's meta-psychology it takes up,
 consciously and unconsciously, a way of exploring the experience of
 thought that could not evade either the matriciel dimension of place or
 the internal relations holding together movement, thought, temporality,
 and death. This is the level of the archaic which is glimpsed in the
 haunting silence of the construction in <I>Nadja</I>, in that radical
 experience of failure.

The difference between <I>pass&eacute; anachronique</I> and
<I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I>, in this context, can best be understood as
follows: <I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I> is an act of interpretation through
recovery that stabilizes form, the present-to-past in a reversibility,
the reconration of the past. It is well understood that such an
act of stabilization is not in principle permanent. <I>Pass&eacute;
anachronique</I>, the <I>Zeitlos</I> of the unconscious, on the
other hand, is a constitutive and founding negativity, whose absences

John Forrester, ibid. "Freud took the silence of the symbol just as he
took the silence of the transference, as creating a practical exigency:
the necessity of connection. But the symbol and the transference
phenomenon--the two occasions for silence-- lay at the opposite ends
of a spectrum: to find the <I>symbolic</I> connection a detour via
the most alien--alien to the patient-- associations, and very often,
as we shall see, via the most obscure linguistic forms, was found to be
necessary. Whereas, with the transference, what was required lay close

The verse "Un baiser est si vite oubli&eacute;" is, whether in
Surrealism or Cubism, a commonplace (<I>un lieu commun</I>). Its
fragmented presentation, like that of a banality, demands repetition as
a means of activation, as Breton observes in "MoS," 341. Banality is
not something to be overcome, but to be transformed within the key of

When Helen and Ridley Ambrose jostle their way through London's narrow
streets toward a ship bound for South America in the opening pages
of Virginia Woolf's <I>The Voyage Out</I>, Ridley momentarily becomes
"entangled . . . with a man selling picture postcards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 When Rachel Vinrace, another passenger on board the <I>Euphrosyne</I>,
 attempts to recall London life while strolling through a South American
 town, she begins by acknowledging the kind of entanglement Ridley
 tries to leave behind: "First there are men selling picture postcards"
 (<I>VO</I>, 91). It makes sense that Rachel's effort to think her way
 back into England should begin with the selling of postcards, for by
 1915 a craze for picture postcards had made them a prominent feature of
 everyday life. The first picture postcards apparently emanated from the
 Paris Exhibition of 1889, and many more were produced in England for such
 large-scale exhibitions as London's Imperial International Exhibition in
 1909 and the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924. This essay
 situates the story of Rachel's education within the cultural politics
 propagated by colonial postcards and imperial exhibitions, and argues
 that the novel's culminating scene of cross-cultural encounter uses
 race to address issues of gender and sexuality that are part of Rachel's
 baggage on her voyage out of England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Written during the so-called golden age of picture postcards, <I>The
Voyage Out</I> follows Rachel up the Amazon in search of a place
"where none but natives had ever trod" (<I>VO</I>, 225). What she
discovers instead is the difficulty of disentangling herself from a
characteristically modern form of cultural expression.

<B></B>

Thanks in part to new postal regulations, postcards circulated
in unprecedented numbers in England at the turn of the century,
and millions more were sent home by English travelers exploring the
boundaries of empire. Far from mere exotic throwaways, widely-collected
colonial postcards contributed to imperial stereotyping by disseminating
primitivist images of indigenous peoples during the most jingoistic
period of England's global dominance. Images of the native other were
also imprinted onto the English imagination by domestic postcards printed
for imperial exhibitions. Underlying the early-century vogue for picture
postcards, as well as the concomitant resurgence of imperial romance,
was a desire for authenticity attached to exotic locales. In a historical
moment increasingly self-conscious about the inescapably mediated nature
of reality, colonial postcards satisfied the desire for the authentic
(i.e., the seemingly immediate) even as their cataloging of exotic images
contributed to the English sense that the realm of the unexplored was
rapidly shrinking.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The process of globalization in the early twentieth century was not
yet far enough along to require the late-century coinage "globality" to
describe the economic integration of a wholly interconnected world. But
<I>The Voyage Out</I> registers an impression of impending globality by
linking the crowded banks of the Thames to the exotic streets of Santa
Marina through the ubiquity of the picture postcard: Ridley's literal
entanglement becomes Rachel's imagined one. Part <I>Bildungsroman</I>,
part imperial romance, Woolf's first novel sometimes res Rachel's
journey to South America as an attempt to voyage out of culture and
history altogether, but her engagement to Terence Hewet while traveling
up the Amazon in effect turns the South American journey into a trip back
into England. Given that Woolf never set foot in South America, it is
not surprising that the mossy path running alongside the Amazon begins
to resemble "a drive in an English forest" or that her description of
native women up the Amazon <I></I>appears to be informed by the popular
ethnography of colonial postcards and imperial exhibitions (<I>VO</I>,
257). Richard Dalloway, who along with his wife Clarissa makes his first
appearance in <I>The Voyage Out</I>, finds the spread of Englishness
deeply satisfying: the "unity of aim, of dominion, of progress"
spreading under the Union Jack, he tells Rachel, makes all the world
a stage for British power (<I>VO</I>, 57). Although Rachel feels "her
small world becoming wonderfully enlarged" under Richard's influence,
her subsequent encounter with the indigenous women suggests that her
world actually remains quite small: as if transplanted from the pitch
at Wembley, this scene of ethnographic exhibition reproduces the complex
dynamics of spectatorship that obtains when one's only real knowledge of
the other comes from looking at picture postcards or people on display
(<I>VO</I>, 75).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Voyage Out</I> has been understood as a straightforward critique
of empire, but Woolf's pivotal scene upriver reveals a more complicated
meditation on the potential entanglement of Englishwomen in the norms
of gender, sex, and race that empire underwrites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Rachel's initiation into Richard's imperial Englishness raises an
 issue that Woolf would pose more pointedly in <I>Three Guineas</I>
 in connection with new economic opportunities for women: "how can we
 enter the professions and yet remain civilized human beings?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Inasmuch as a woman's success in "the patriarchal system"

<B></B>

runs the risk that "the words 'For God and the Empire' will . . . be
written, like the address on a dog-collar, round your neck," Woolf
worries that Englishwomen already colonized under patriarchy "like
slaves in a harem" may become colonizers in their turn as they follow
"the procession . . . of educated men" into the public sphere (<I>TG</I>,
64, 74, 70). Although Woolf's critique of war and empire in <I>Three
Guineas</I> is more univocal and forceful than the implicit critique
worked out in Rachel's story, <I>The Voyage Out</I> probes more deeply
into the gap between gendered and racial identities that the polemical
invocation of "slaves in a harem" obscures. For Woolf's struggle with
racial difference in her first novel's culminating scene of exhibition
brings her to the brink of acknowledging the imperial grounding of her
own whiteness, and the depth of her affective engagement makes race a
crucial feature of her work, for the first and last time.

Much like the vogue for posters that hit London and Europe at the turn
of the century, picture postcards, first used in Great Britain in the
1890s, quickly became highly prized objects for English collectors and
the general public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 An astonishing range of cards suffused all levels of culture: images
 of new technology, photos of actresses, Boer War battle commemorations,
 novelty cards, and popular crazes from ping-pong to roller skating. The
 state, along with political groups of various stripes, quickly found
 a new agent of propaganda, and topical postcards began to enter
 into debates about suffrage, tariff reform, and imperial policy. The
 advertising industry capitalized on the new form so effectively that by
 1903 a man sending a South African postcard of an African woman washing
 a young child with the caption "O dirty boy!" to his sister on the Isle
 of Wight suggested it would be "a very good adv. for Pears Soap/you ought
 to send it to the firm"(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The postcard evinces not only the deep link established by the turn of
 the century between advertising and postcards, but also the degree to
 which both, spreading along paths cut by empire, were mediating English
 views of the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This new mass cultural form spread so quickly owing in part to changes
in British and international postal regulations. In 1899 British postal
regulations permitted the standard-sized card already used in Europe to
circulate freely, and a special postal rate of one halfpenny for domestic
delivery encouraged Edwardians to send postcards on the slightest pretext:
"'Hope to be in time for tea this afternoon!'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Just as journals arose around the poster phenomenon, so monthly
 publications such as <I>The Picture Postcard &amp; Collector's
 Chronicle</I> (1900-1907) and <I>The Postcard Connoisseur for
 Postcard Collectors</I>  sprang up to serve the needs of avid
 collectors. "During the quarter of a century that preceded the Great
 War in 1914," according to one historian of the postcard, "it would
 have been hard to find anyone who did not buy postcards from genuine
 pleasure. People preserved them carefully in their albums, or they
 posted them to their friends or relations, in the expectation of
 receiving others in return."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Royalty was more cautious yet not immune: Queen Victoria asked a relative
to compile an album for her.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not everyone was pleased with this sudden suffusion of images. As in
contemporary fears about the rise of consumer culture, women in particular
were red as both victims and carriers of a new cultural disease.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 An article in the <I>Standard</I> in 1899 observes dryly that "The
 illustrated postcard craze, like the influenza, has spread to these
 islands from the Continent, where it has been raging with considerable
 severity. Sporadic cases have occurred in Britain. Young ladies who have
 escaped the philatelic infection or wearied of collecting Christmas
 cards, have been known to fill albums with missives of this kind from
 friends abroad" (quoted in <I>PPO</I>, 60). A few years later the
 <I>Glasgow Evening News</I> worried that "In ten years Europe will
 be buried beneath picture postcards." As if to confirm these fears,
 a drawing in the <I>Illustrated London News</I> (October 16, 1909)
 shows Germans in an open-air restaurant buying cards for immediate
 posting from a postman with a letterbox on his back.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although fears of a Continental invasion sound a familiar note of English
xenophobia, pundits were right to sense in the postcard signs of profound
cultural changes, for "at the height of the industry's boom, postcards
were virtually everywhere in the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Among contemporary commentators, James Douglas, writing in 1907,
 captured the peculiar modernity of postcards best when he imagined
 thirtieth-century archeologists fastening on "the Picture Postcard as
 the best guide to the spirit of the Edwardian era": "Every pimple on
 the earth's skin has been photographed, and wherever the

<B></B>

human eye roves or roams it detects the self-conscious air of the
reproduced" (quoted in <I>PPO</I>, 79). The "self-conscious air of
the reproduced": the phrase nicely evokes a range of experiences of
modernity, from Walter Benjamin's ambivalent eulogy for the auratic
in an age of mechanical reproduction to the growing desire for the
exotic in late imperial romance. Viewed from the twenty-first century,
then, the picture postcard begins to look like an emerging modernist
form--displacing the formal conventions of epistolary style with now
familiar vacation shorthand; eschewing the totalizing expansiveness of
Victorian narrative in favor of fragmentary utterances and the primacy
of the image; subordinating authorship to mechanical reproduction;
and seeking authenticity beyond the artifice of civilization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, the modern problem of authenticity helps account for the pervasive
circulation of picture postcards. The thrill of the postcard, Susan
Stewart has argued, derives from a hunger for a sense of authenticity
attached to location.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 An unprecedentedly public form of communication, postcards paradoxically
 function as a guarantor of the authentically personal. "Here I was,"
 the postcard declares to the recipient, thus bringing into being the
 "I" as both familiar sender and exotic locale, the two temporarily
 equated through the metaphor of location. The picture postcard thus
 participates in a process of subject formation marked by empire. For
 the uncanny subject produced by the postcard implies a dual relation
 to the pictured site that restages (in a less threatening register)
 the precarious dynamics of colonial exchange: the tourist assumes the
 subject position of the colonizer by appropriating the exotic site and
 returning it to the metropole; yet with its articulation propped on the
 authenticity of "being there," the familiar subject also appears to have
 "gone native" by merging with the space of the exotic, a transformation
 typically triggered within the recipient as well, who gazes at the
 image as if through the sender's eyes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf was undoubtedly attuned to the increasingly inescapable circulation
of picture postcards and its influence on the public imagination. Like
everyone else, she sent picture postcards, requested others to send them
to her, and complained about them as well, sometimes because she didn't
receive enough from friends abroad, sometimes because she did and would
have preferred a letter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Woolf mocked the older generation for their belief that postcards were
 killing the art of letter-writing, believing instead that the penny
 post was making letter-writing less studied and more sincere--which
 is to say more modern (<I>EOVW</I>, 2:182). In 1930 Woolf even wrote
 a caption for a National Portrait Gallery postcard of George Eliot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Yet she also saw picture postcards as emblems of transience and
 diminishment, writing of Ellen Terry that those who saw her only in a
 recent relatively undistinguished role would remember only "a picture
 postcard compared with the great Velasquez in the gallery" (<I>EOVW</I>,
 4:67). In <I>Jacob's Room</I> Fanny Elmer's stylized "idea of Jacob,"
 which for "two months" is "sustained entirely upon picture post cards,"
 indicates that her memory and imagination, like Rachel's when imagining
 England from abroad, are marked by Edwardian society's newest mass
 cultural form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 <I>The Waves</I>  registers the diminished cultural visibility of
 picture postcards--the craze subsided with the end of World War I--in
 Neville's thoughts about Percival: "He will forget me. He will leave
 my letters lying

<B></B>

about among guns and dogs unanswered. I shall send him poems and he will
perhaps reply with a picture post card."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Bittersweet tokens of neglect, postcards here seem to speak of their
 own evanescence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf was also well-versed in the Edwardian culture of exhibition. In
1909, when Woolf was laboriously reworking the manuscript that would
become <I>The Voyage Out</I>, the Imperial International Exhibition
in London brought several native settlements to Shepherd's Bush. Like
colonial postcards, imperial exhibitions collapsed the distance between
periphery and center by reproducing versions of colonized life on
English soil. But where the dynamics of postcard circulation subtly
mimed the process of imperial subject formation, imperial exhibitions
materially reproduced the operations of power by bringing actual bodies
back to England, where they became human exhibits within reconstructed
native villages. As many have shown, such exhibitions were designed
to consolidate belief in imperial superiority, most obviously in
the evolutionary vision that emphasized the enlightened progress from
benighted colonies into the aptly named White City, the main exhibition
center in England from 1907 to 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 From the 1890s to 1914 the rising number of simulated native villages
 created a species of "human showcase": "people from all over the
 world were brought into sites in order to be seen by others for their
 gratification and education. . . . [an] audience would pay to come
 and stare."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 With the whole world (in the form of the assembled peoples and objects)
 spread out before their controlling vision, spectators would watch
 one another watch the spectacle and thereby become part of the human
 showcase. But the English spectators became part of the display only
 in a privileged way: by seeing from an empowered position even as
 they were seen, spectators came to understand themselves as belonging
 to a particular kind of national community (<I>ROM</I>, 69). At one
 moment visitors might travel over the grounds by electric railway or
 enjoy a simulated trip to Paris through the long-planned "chunnel";
 the next they might wander into a Mongolian camp where twenty horsemen,
 "uncouth allies of a civilized power," engage in "a mimic battle" over
 "the body of a goat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Designed to persuade the metropolitan spectator that the "there" of
 colonial space had become the "here" of domestic English experience,
 such villages sharpened the contrast between England's technological
 modernity and the backwardness of outlying colonies by plunging the
 spectator into a form of "state-sponsored hallucination."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Here's what we are and will be, the Hall of Science might say;
 here's what we might have been once but are no longer, say the native
 villages. <B></B>To lock in a clearer sense of the place of the picture
 postcard within early twentieth-century modernization, then, we can say
 that postcard collections epitomize the effort of imperial exhibitions
 to assemble a complete image of the emerging global system even as
 individual cards herald the fragmentation of the totality that such
 exhibitions sought to represent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's essay on the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, "Thunder at Wembley,"
suggests that she had attended imperial exhibitions before, possibly
the 1909 London exhibition, and recognized their power to absorb the
spectator into an artificially transformed world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The official guide to the Imperial International Exhibition describes
 what Woolf would have experienced in the hallucinatory space of the
 Dahomey Village:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . we are at once transported to Western Africa, the land of the
Dahomeys and the Amazons. The beating of tom-toms, the panigan clanging,
and the grinding roar of the rattle greet us. Only a few years ago these
sounds meant the call to human sacrifices, but in this instance they
announce that these dark-skinned men and women and children are anxious
to entertain us by dance and song. Over 150 Dahomeys have taken up their
residence here, and reside in thatched huts just as they did before they
left the Dark Continent for the White City. [<I>DP</I>, 49-50]

Magically transported, the spectator is asked to see West Africa
as at once out of history and modernized: the thatched huts may be
unchanged, but barbaric violence is transformed into civilized spectacle,
blood-thirsty savages into anxious entertainers. The official guide's
strolling observer encourages an expansion of the exhibition's sphere of
influence: "Purchasing some picture-postcards from one of the many stalls
here, we plunge into the Post Office on our right, and despatch them to
unfortunate friends who have not seen the exhibition" (<I>DP</I>, 10).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Whether Woolf ever received such a postcard (see, for instance,
 <A HREF="8.1wollaeger_2.html"> 2</A>) is impossible to say,
 but "Thunder at Wembley" reveals that she thought deeply about the
 propagandistic effects of such exhibitions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's relation to exhibition culture evolved over the years, and
her essay on the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley reads like
a halfway house between the later optimism of <I>The Waves</I> 
and <I>Between the Acts</I>  and the early pessimism of <I>The
Voyage Out</I>. Reading Woolf's career in reverse, one can see that her
belief in these late novels, that spectacles can catalyze change, is
steadily displaced by worry over the seductive power of state-sponsored
spectacles, and her confidence in the power of individuals to deflect
or transform ideological conditioning decays.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bernard's fantasy of Percival in India in <I>The Waves</I> produces a
sharply satiric perspective: "'I see India,' said Bernard. '. . . I see
the gilt and crenellated buildings which have an air of fragility and
decay as if they were temporarily run up buildings in some Oriental
exhibition'" (<I>TW</I>, 135-36). Within this imagined scene of
exhibition, Percival, wearing his sun helmet, solves "the Oriental
problem" of "the uselessness of human exertion" in a trice by "applying
the standards of the West" (<I>TW</I>, 136). The "air of fragility
and decay" suggests that the power of such displays has passed--they
function now only as metaphors--and secures Woolf's ironic distance from
the imperial values implicit in "Oriental" exhibitions. A decade later
in <I>Between the Acts</I> Woolf turns to a pageant play to explore the
deploying of spectacles for progressive ends. Miss La Trobe's historical
pageant culminates in a late modernist assertion of fragmentation--not
only its inevitability but its potential power--when in its closing
moment the players hold up shattered mirrors to the audience. By pushing
spectators "between" versions of themselves--or "jerk[ing] the ball out
of the cup"--La Trobe produces a moment of radical defamiliarization
from which new possibilities or "unacted parts" can emerge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 "What a small part I've had to play! But you've made me feel I could have
 played . . . Cleopatra!" says Lucy Swithin, an elderly woman unlikely to
 be mistaken for the Queen of the Nile (<I>BA</I>, 153). Feeling neither
 here nor there, La Trobe's audience begins to re-examine their national
 past in light of a transformed present, and her play becomes Woolf's
 trope for the power of spectacle to loosen an audience's otherwise
 secure ideological moorings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's attitude towards ideological spectacles is less assured and
more equivocal in "Thunder at Wembley" . E. M. Forster predicted
that while millions spend their money on the pitch at Wembley, "a few
highbrows will make fun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Woolf doesn't entirely disappoint. Her only extended description of
 exhibition-going anticipates the satiric tone of <I>The Waves</I> by
 pitting the ideological hold of empire, located in a display of global
 commodities, against an apocalyptic vision of nature rising up in the
 form of a sudden summer thunderstorm. The storm ultimately breaks the
 imperial "spell" and purges the world of the exhibitionary blight, but
 Woolf suggests that "Nature" also asserts herself in the individuality of
 spectators able to resist the show's blandishments. The failure of the
 exhibition's ideological project leads to Woolf's dry observation that
 perhaps the Duke of Devonshire, who praised the goal of the exhibition
 in <I>The Times</I>, should have denied entrance to all natural forces.

 The essay closes with a mock prophecy: "The Empire is perishing; the
 bands are playing; the Exhibition is in ruins" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412, 413).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "dissolving" pagodas and general "decay" of Woolf's Wembley probably
are the originals for "the fragility and decay" of the "temporarily run
up buildings" in Bernard's vision of Percival. Yet Wembley's attractions
are not without effect. For if the "dignity" of Woolf's stubbornly
independent compatriots makes them "a product to be proud of," they are
also "a little languid perhaps, a little attenuated," even docile as they
"stand in queues to have their spectacles rectified gratis . . . gaze
respectfully into sacks

<B></B>

of grain; glance reverently at mowing machines" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3: 413,
411). The idea of having one's vision corrected while studying commodities
at an imperial exhibition implies that the "product to be proud of" may
actually be precisely what Woolf says it is not: one product circulating
among others, a mass-produced, mesmerized English collectivity "trailing
and flowing" between the "coffee-grinder" and the "cream separator"
(<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Woolf's description of previous exhibitions at
Earls Court and the White City raises comparable questions about her
own immunity. In the earlier exhibitions, "The area was too small;
the light was too brilliant. If a single real moth strayed in to dally
with the arc lamps, he was at once transformed into a dizzy reveler;
if a laburnum tree shook her tassels, spangles of limelight floated in
the violet and crimson air. Everything was intoxicated and transformed"
(<I>EOVW</I>, 3:411). Given Woolf's well-known trope of the moth as
the artistic spirit, this example of the exhibition's absolute mastery
of nature suggests the danger that state propaganda might be able to
intoxicate and transform even her own imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet "Thunder at Wembley" also implies that Woolf is protected from dizzy
revelers by her class position, for both ends of the class spectrum seem
insulated from the ideological hailing of the state, epitomized mockingly
by a man banging a "bladder" while imploring spectators "to come tickle
the monkeys" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). At one end of the spectrum is a lower
middle-class woman "in the row of red-brick villas outside the grounds"
who wrings "a dish-cloth in the backyard" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Situated
beyond the boundaries of the exhibition, this woman remains unswayed by
imperial propaganda. At the other end is an obvious surrogate for Woolf,
a thrush to which Woolf attributes the "cynical reflection, at once so
chill and so superior," that the spectators surely could not be seduced
into tickling monkeys or otherwise responding to the siren song of the
exhibition. The song of the thrush does for exhibition-goers what Woolf
wishes to do for her readers: it undermines the efficacy of the official
message by calling attention to the beauty of nature--"a whole chestnut
tree with its blossoms standing . . . ordinary grass scattered with
petals"--that was transmogrified by earlier exhibitions (<I>EOVW</I>,
3:412). Nevertheless, the suspicion underlying "Thunder at Wembley" is
that the vast middle class lying between the chill superiority of the
thrush and the unwitting washer of dishes may be inclined to settle into
the posture refused by the sky: in an otherwise inexplicable negation,
the sky, Woolf informs her readers, is <I>not</I> found "lying back limp
but acquiescent in a green deckchair," and therefore never becomes "part
of the exhibition" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3:412). Insofar as other spectators,
foils for the rebellious sky, presumably do become part of the scenery,
the vision of the empire in ruins belongs only to the thrush and Woolf.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's surrogate in <I>The Voyage Out</I> is more vulnerable to the
hailing of empire, for the critical distance enjoyed by Woolf and Forster
at Wembley is unavailable to Rachel. In the novel's opening chapter,
London's West End, with "its electric lamps . . . vast plate-glass windows
. . . carefully-finished houses, and tiny live res trotting on the
pavement," is described as "a finished work" produced by the "enormous
factory" of east London (<I>VO</I>, 8). This is more than a familiar
modernist lament over the increasing regimentation of modern life. The
plate-glass windows, equally suitable for

<B></B>

the display of goods or antiquities, metonymically invoke the convergence
of consumerism and exhibitionary culture, and the English urbanites,
far from resisting the propagandistic display of consumer goods,
themselves become commodities, "tiny live res" manufactured to
populate the streets of the West End showcase (<I>VO</I>, 8). As the
Ambroses pass through this scene on their way to the <I>Euphrosyne</I>,
they can expect "neither help nor attention," we are told, from "a world
exclusively occupied in feeding waggons" (<I>VO</I>, 8-9). Woolf
hints that Rachel is similarly helpless; she may even be part of her
father's inventory: when Rachel later sighs over the "poor goats" her
father is shipping to South America, Woolf is coyly alluding to her own
family nickname, "Goat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the ship sets out, England is reduced to a "shrinking island in which
people were imprisoned" (<I>VO</I>, 26). It is in this oppressively
commercial prison that Ridley Ambrose momentarily finds himself entangled
with a man selling picture postcards. And it is this crowded space that
Rachel reinvokes when her imaginative reconstruction of England begins
with postcards. South America, always an imaginary realm of the exotic
for Woolf, ought to be different.

 But as Rachel is educated abroad, London's human showcase rematerializes
 across the ocean and up the Amazon, transforming native women into
 ethnographic exhibits and Rachel into an object destined for enjoyment
 by a young Englishman.

3. Educating Rachel: Bildungsroman, Sex, and Empire
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rachel's education is supervised by Helen at the request of Rachel's
father, who wants a polished hostess around the house to further his
Tory ambitions. Early in the novel Woolf links Rachel's education to
colonial exploration by framing Helen's realization that she would like
to teach her niece "how to live" with allusions to Helen's embroidery
(<I>VO</I>, 76). As if weaving the expedition up the Amazon that will
shape Rachel's fate, Helen works at "a great design of a tropical river
running through a tropical forest, where . . . a troop of naked natives
whirled darts into the air" (<I>VO</I>, 27).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The alliterative repetition of "tropical . . . tropical . . . troop"
 suggests the status of Helen's embroidery as trope, and her "great
 design" grows more capacious as the novel unfolds: it includes,
 among other things, her hopes that Rachel will marry as well as
 her entrusting of Rachel's education to Hirst, Terence's arrogant
 friend. From this point on <I>The Voyage Out</I> combines conventions
 of the <I>Bildungsroman</I> with those of late imperial romance in
 order to narrate Rachel's painful struggle to disentangle herself from
 "the pattern" of everyday life. This pattern, alternately a source
 of consolation and frustration, falls into a rhythm of expansion and
 contraction as Rachel tries to grasp her world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Politics always inform Rachel's education--not just the cultural politics
implicit in any education but the imperial politics governing England's
vision of the world as well. Well before Hirst lends her his copy of
Gibbon's <I>Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire</I>, Rachel learns about
empire from the Dalloways, who initiate her informal education when
they board the <I>Euphrosyne</I> in Lisbon. Catalyzing Rachel's suddenly
intense desire

<B></B>

to know the world--"'Please tell me--everything.' That was what she
wanted to say"--the Dalloways offer formative lessons in culture, empire,
and sexuality (<I>VO</I>, 50). Clarissa, "a fascinating spectacle,"
strikes Rachel as a gallery exhibit: "she was astonishingly like an
eighteenth-century masterpiece--a Reynolds or a Romney" (<I>VO</I>,
40). Consonant with her initial impression, Clarissa's lessons, like
her first comment to Rachel, are primarily cultural: "'It's so like
Whistler!' she exclaimed, with a wave toward the shore" (<I>VO</I>,
34). Cultural capital represents enormous power to Rachel, and Clarissa
seems able to make "the enormous globe [spin] round this way and that
beneath her fingers" (<I>VO</I>, 40).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Richard, who offers nearly simultaneous lessons in empire and sexuality,
also strikes Rachel as a fascinating spectacle with virtually global
power. Like a display from the Palace of Industry viewed from a patently
erotic perspective, he comes from "the humming oily centre of the
machine where the polished rods are sliding, and the pistons thumping"
(<I>VO</I>, 40). His political beliefs, he tells Rachel, can be summed
up in "one word--Unity. . . . The dispersion of the best ideas over the
greatest area" (<I>VO</I>, 57). Clarissa is nearby during Richard's first
lesson about sexuality but apparently does not overhear him speaking
to Rachel about sexual desire: "Girls are kept very ignorant, aren't
they?" he notes, as Rachel grows increasingly agitated (<I>VO</I>,
61). Just as she confesses her ignorance, they are interrupted:
"Warships, Dick!" Clarissa calls out. Even if we do not hear "warships"
as "worships," the exclamation is suggestive enough. As Rachel watches
Richard raise his hat to "two sinister grey vessels," Clarissa squeezes
her hand and exclaims: "Aren't you glad to be English!" (<I>VO</I>,
62). Upset by Richard's probing, Rachel remains quiet, looking "queer"
and "flushed." Clarissa's enveloping enthusiasm, however, gathers into
Englishness a link between empire and sexuality that receives increasing
attention as the narrative unfolds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Clarissa absent, Richard becomes a more hands-on instructor in the
pleasures of being English. Having shared his dream of consolidating the
world under the aegis of the British empire, Dalloway later drops into
Rachel's cabin and impulsively kisses her. "You tempt me," he explains
(<I>VO</I>, 68). Though his kiss produces a passing pleasure, only then
does Rachel begin to realize, to her shock and horror, why women cannot
walk alone in public. From this moment until her death she is haunted
by a dream in which she walks down a "long tunnel" with "damp bricks
on either side" that opens into "a vault," where she is "trapped" with
"a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering"; the "wall
behind him oozed with damp" (<I>VO</I>, 69-70). The sexual revulsion
expressed here is the last stage of Rachel's response to Dalloway's kiss:
"physical pain" leads to a numbing "chill of mind and body" and then to a
"strange exultation," before Rachel finally becomes "merely uncomfortable,
as if she and Richard had seen something together which is hidden in
ordinary life" (<I>VO</I>, 69). Trapped at once by her own sexuality
inside a damp womb and by an internalized cityscape evocative of an
underpass or the Underground, Rachel's sudden sexual awareness seems to
put her on the street along with the women she had never before recognized
as prostitutes. What Rachel has discovered "hidden in ordinary life"
are desires she cannot trust, her own and those of the men around her.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dalloway's kiss also bears on Helen's efforts to teach Rachel about
the ways of everyday life, for it is the revelation of Rachel's
sexual innocence that persuades Helen to arrange for her to stay in
Helen's brother's seaside villa instead of continuing inland with her
father. Explaining that Dalloway's overture is "the most natural thing
in the world," a "small thing that gets on one's nerves," "like noticing
the noises people make when they eat, or men spitting," Helen affects
Rachel in contradictory yet equally profound ways (<I>VO</I>, 74). On one
hand, by trying to help Rachel work through her upsetting experience,
Helen draws her young charge into a normative vision of heterosexual
relations that Rachel finds stifling. When Helen confirms that "those
women" in Piccadilly are prostitutes, Rachel suddenly sees "her whole
life for the first time a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously
between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness"
(<I>VO</I>, 74). On the other hand, by demystifying the Dalloways'
allure, Helen helps Rachel experience an expansive "vision of her own
personality . . . as a real everlasting thing, different from anything
else, unmergeable" (<I>VO</I>, 77). It is characteristic of Woolf's
ambivalent presentation of Helen that Helen explicitly rejects the
connection between sex and politics that Rachel intuits. (Why else
would Rachel run to read about public res in <I>Who's Who</I> right
after coming to terms with Dalloway's kiss?) Discounting "this confusion
between politics and kissing politicians," Helen continues to stitch at
her embroidery, unaware that her great design helps propagate Dalloway's
vision of a unified world (<I>VO</I>, 76).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When the <I>Euphrosyne</I> arrives in Santa Marina, Richard's imperial
ideals are immediately reinvoked. English sailors in "Elizabethan
barques," we learn, had established a "great British colony" only to be
displaced by Spanish galleons: "All seemed to favour the expansion of
the British Empire, and had there been men like Richard Dalloway in the
time of Charles the First, the map would undoubtedly be red where it is
now an odious green" (<I>VO</I>, 81-82). In the years prior to their
arrival a second chance has developed in the form of "a small colony" of
English "in search of something new" who found in Santa Marina a place
"full of new forms of beauty," including "strangely beautiful" natives
and "primitive carvings coloured bright greens and blues" (<I>VO</I>,
82-83). The desire to find something new ushers the reader into the
attenuated exoticism of <I>The Voyage Out</I>'s invocation of imperial
romance.

4. Imperial Romance and the Weight of the World
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reinvented for nineteenth-century fiction by Sir Walter Scott, modern
romance literature represents modernity's uncanny vision of the worlds it
has superseded. By the late nineteenth century, romance had to work hard
to recover traces of what might have existed prior to the global reach of
capital. Hence Marlow's lament in <I>Heart of Darkness</I> that all the
blank spots of the map had already been colored in by colonial powers,
a trope echoed as the <I>Euphrosyne</I> arrives in Santa Marina in the
"odious green" of Spain's holdings in South America (<I>VO</I>, 82).
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Woolf organizes Rachel's South American experience around three
 excursions, each of which draws on romance conventions: the journey
 from England; the picnic ascent of Mt. Rosa; and the trip up the Amazon.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ascent of Monte Rosa locates the story of Rachel's growing intimacy
with Terence within a vision of global domestication and elaborates
the link between sexuality and politics already implicit in Rachel's
ambivalent response to Dalloway. As Evelyn and Alfred Perrott, two
relatively minor characters, overlook the South American plains from
the summit, Evelyn announces that if she were a man, she would "raise a
troop and conquer some great territory": "I'd love to start life from the
very beginning as it ought to be" (<I>VO</I>, 127). Poor Perrott, clearly
overmatched, can muster only a weakly literal-minded rebuttal: "conquer
a territory? They're all conquered already, aren't they?" (<I>VO</I>,
127). Perhaps a young Edwardian gentleman could be forgiven for supposing
that all lands had been claimed, most of them by England, but Evelyn sighs
in response: "It's the idea, don't you see? We lead such tame lives"
(<I>VO</I>, 127). Through the re of Evelyn, a parodic archetype of
woman as colonizer, the novel repeatedly links the domestication of women
to the domestication of the globe: at one moment Evelyn is turning down
yet another marriage proposal, in the next she fantasizes about becoming
a second Napoleon.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rest of the chapter sustains the tension between Evelyn's bracing
vision of unexplored worlds and the prospect of a wholly domesticated
globe by counterpointing Rachel's impulse to withdraw from society
with the sense that rituals of social engagement are inescapable. Two
moments mark opposite ends of the spectrum: the sudden connection
between Helen and Mrs. Thornbury forged by the discovery of a single
common acquaintance--"Mrs. Parry's drawing-room, though thousands of
miles away, behind a vast curve of water on a tiny piece of earth,
came before their eyes"--and the closing words of the previous chapter,
in which Terence asks Rachel what she is looking at as she reclines
away from the others: "She was a little startled but answered directly,
'Human beings.'" (<I>VO</I>, 136). Since Rachel tends to position herself
like an ethnographer outside her own culture, it is fitting that she
first sees Terence while peering in through a hotel window. The plot,
however, soon pulls Rachel into hotel society, where she plays the piano
at an engagement dance. If Evelyn wants to remake civilization "from the
very beginning" on her own terms, Rachel evidently has good reason to
feel increasingly trapped within a culture always ready to materialize,
like Mrs. Parry's drawing-room, wherever two Englishmen meet, even across
"a vast curve of water."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rachel's personal encounters in the chapters leading up to the river
expedition heap up more reasons for wishing to step outside her
culture. Unfolding like a series of experiments, these relationships
elaborate the pattern of confinement and expansion that begins with
Rachel's ambivalent response to Richard and Helen and continues into
her relationship with Terence. With Terence Rachel feels alternately
at ease and trapped. When she tells him about her shuttered life in
Richmond with her aunts she finds her way to a "childlike state of
interest and pleasure"--until Terence explains that her everyday life
interests him because as a fledgling novelist he craves information about
women. Suddenly "under observation," Rachel experiences his "determination
to know" as a form of bullying, and indeed, his perception of her body
during their conversation foreshadows the increasingly domineering role
he will play after

<B></B>

their engagement (<I>VO</I>, 201). Although Terence sees "a young woman's
body not yet developed . . . and thus interesting and even lovable,"
Woolf betrays Terence's <I>need</I> to see Rachel as undeveloped and
dependent by reminding us a few sentences later that she is twenty-four
years old (<I>VO</I>, 196).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The social pressure on Rachel's body intensifies when she finds herself
caught up in a series of obscurely instructive and ambiguously erotic
encounters with other women in the hotel. Evelyn captures Rachel
first, and her aggressive challenge to Rachel to seize the day--"We
don't <I>do</I> things. What do you <I>do</I>?"--takes on an erotic
cast when she places her hand on Rachel's knee, which Rachel finds
"exciting" and "also disagreeable" (<I>VO</I>, 236, 237). Escaping
Evelyn's clutches, Rachel finds herself looking down from a balcony on
a kitchen courtyard where an old woman runs down a chicken and cuts off
its head "with an expression of vindictive energy and triumph combined"
(<I>VO</I>, 240). Rachel recoils from the violence and is immediately
gathered up by the spinster Miss Allan, who shepherds Rachel into her
room on the chance that she might want to "add a new pleasure to life"
(<I>VO</I>, 241). "I make it a rule to try everything," Miss Allan remarks
as Rachel spits out some preserved ginger the older woman had urged on
her (<I>VO</I>, 241). Rachel is then introduced to Miss Allan's regular
traveling companion, a bottle of cr&ecirc;me de menthe two years older
than Rachel named Oliver, which a female friend bestows on her whenever
she travels abroad. In a kind of dream logic, the decapitation of the
chicken colors the subtly unsettling scenes with Miss Allan and Evelyn
on either side, as if to say that any role available to women requires
a sacrifice, a sacrifice Rachel will later embody while dying of fever.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tension between a muted eroticism urging untried experiences
and the insistent banality of existence intensifies Rachel's sense
of being trapped in an increasingly familiar pattern. Leaving Miss
Allan's room, Rachel soon finds herself in "a complete block in the
passage" when they run into Mrs. Paley (<I>VO</I>, 245). The hallway
being lined with shoes set out for cleaning, Miss Allan tries to make
conversation with the nearly deaf older woman by repeating three times:
"I was just saying that people are so like their boots" (<I>VO</I>,
244). She is about to repeat this home truth for a fourth time when
Rachel bolts away to a <I>cul de sac</I> at the end of the hall, where
she is gripped by a vision of the world "in its true proportions":
"She disliked the look of it immensely--churches, politicians, misfits,
and huge impostures. . . . For the time, her own body was the source of
all the life in the world, which tried to burst forth here--there--and
was repressed now by Mr. Bax, now by Evelyn, now by the imposition
of ponderous stupidity, the weight of the entire world" (<I>VO</I>,
245). Mr. Bax has earned Rachel's anger with a sermon on the duty the
English owe the colonized that translates Dalloway's imperial vision
into a Christian imperative: properly practiced, Christian sympathy,
like a drop of water falling into the ocean, "alters the conration of
the globe" (<I>VO</I>, 220). Once again, Woolf links Rachel's everyday
life to a sense of global interrelatedness, weaving Christianity along
with English imperialism, marriage, and patriarchy into the great design
shaping Rachel's confused maturation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "weight of the world," "the conration of the globe": against
pressure of this magnitude Rachel's desire for release grows. It is thus
not surprising that Mr. Flushing's

<B></B>

exotic picture of what might await them up the Amazon captures Rachel's
imagination: ". . . wonderful treasures lay hid in the depths of
the land. . . . there might be giant gods hewn out of stone in the
mountain-side; and colossal res standing by themselves in the middle
of green pasture lands, where none but natives had ever trod. . . .
Nobody had been there; scarcely anything was known" (<I>VO</I>,
225). Far from entering the "lost world" of Conan Doyle's South America,
however, the expedition party will travel into a world to which, as in
the vision of India in <I>The Waves</I>, "the standards of the West"
have already been applied. The native women they meet upriver resemble
the postcard images of native woman that flowed into England from South
America and Africa, and the circulation of such postcards, I will show
in the following sections, both reinforced and undermined the imperial
stereotypes that Rachel must negotiate as she follows English culture
out into the world and attempts to establish her identity.

 In their insistent framing and arranging of the female body, colonial

 a scene of partially erased sexual dissidence, and her encounter with

Postcards featuring native women often operate as a form of colonial
denigration that reinforces normative values at home.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 In an early century card from Peru, three bare-breasted women, all of
 whom are short, heavy, and sullen by prevailing European standards,
 earn the title "<I>las tres gracias de las Indias Piros</I>" (<A
 HREF="8.1wollaeger_3.html"> 3</A>). Circulating with huge
 numbers of cards displaying English actresses, music hall performers,
 and famous courtesans, this card hardly bothers to disguise the snicker
 behind the cross-cultural gesture of its caption. The imposition of
 a Western frame is often more stark, as in a card bearing the caption
 "A Zulu Masher" (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_4.html"> 4</A>). Dated
 by hand February 14, 1905, the card shows a smiling young Zulu woman
 whose native beads and belt are supplemented with top hat, monocle,
 jauntily held cigarette, and stylish walking stick. Given the common
 Western assumption that Africans, particularly women, were oversexed,
 a male recipient might construe the card as a mocking performance of
 his masculinity in blackface.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Yet if cross-dressing often disrupts cultural norms, the cross-racial
 and cross-gender masquerade in this exchange seems more likely to have
 reinforced traditional roles. Addressed on Valentine's Day to a "Miss
 F. Southwell" by "Georgie Southwell" (a playful joke at a sister's
 expense?), the card implies that a woman's failure to rein in desires
 may subject her to ridicule.

Less satiric cards sometimes inscribe non-white women into
English culture as objects of genuine aesthetic and erotic
appreciation. In an early-century card collected in Kenya (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_5.html"> 5</A>), a woman from the Boran tribe
is posed to display her visual appeal; similar cards sometimes use the
caption "A Native Beauty." In other cards a more

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 59]</B>

stylized composition produces a kind of formal portraiture
that further aestheticizes the women, abstracting them
from the scene of colonial encounter. In a card from Natal (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_6.html"> 6</A>), for instance, the symmetrical
arrangement of trees and women doubly framing a Zulu woman made to stage
her toilet for the camera partially transforms the indigenous environment
into the artificial space of a studio. The effacing of the indigenous
setting is complete in other cards, such as Eduardo Polack's shot of a
"Bella India" in Peru (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_7.html"> 7</A>),
which whites out any trace of the model's own environment. Insofar as
these women become interchangeable with images of English actresses and
courtesans circulating in England, the photographic abstraction blurring
the differences between the English and "the native" begins to resemble a
form of symbolic acculturation: in Elizabethan times women were imported
into Santa Marina's first settlement; these cards complete the exchange
by shaping women into objects suitable for export (<I>VO</I>, 82).

The sexual and racial meanings disseminated by such cards depends in part
on the interplay between production and circulation. In an early-century
example from Natal (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_8.html"> 8</A>),
three signs plot the card's itinerary: the postmark (July 24, 1904),
the address to a Miss Ashby in Yorkshire, and the message inscribed on
the front: "I am feeling

<B></B>

<B></B>

better again. Will write next week." With the angles of her right
arm balanced by the angles formed by her left arm and the banjo, the
"native musician" is virtually abstracted. The subordination of the body
to an angular design is both heightened and complicated by the musical
instrument, for the banjo does not simply complete the triangular motif
established by the women's right arm: in origin an African instrument,
the banjo would have been recognized by European and American audiences
as a signifier of race owing to its incorporation into minstrel shows.

 In fact, this complex articulation of a racialized body within
 a Western design, in circulation just over a year before Picasso
 began to "Africanize" <I>les Desmoiselles d'Avigon</I>, constitutes a
 popular anticipation of the vogue for primitivism that would transform
 European high art over the next decade. Race is thus inseparable from
 the abstraction, as is the prurient interest in the woman's nudity,
 the pose evidently being dictated as much by the desire to

<B></B>

have her breast lifted toward the camera as by the formal requirements
of symmetry. The suggestiveness that would have been activated by
any sexual innuendo in a message sent to a man is mitigated here by
the banality of the inscription and the fact that the addressee is an
unmarried woman. Instead, consonant with the emergence of museum culture,
the image takes on a certain clinical quality, an effect amplified
in the ethnographic perspective solicited by the printed caption, "A
Native musician." The card's trajectory from Natal to Yorkshire thus
partially erases the erotic investment in the exotic other that shaped
the production of the card in the first place. While in many staged
photographs a glimpse of the reality of the models' lives shows through,
in this instance the rescripting through exchange (the inscription and
mailing of the card) of a body already scripted within the colonial
scene of production (the photographer's arranging of the model) results
in an overdetermined cultural coding that obliterates any sense of the
historical body prior to its entry into the studio. A token of exchange,
the model is transformed into an image of racialized sexuality sanitized
for export to England.

Without this coding, the strict norms regulating English sexual expression
at home (although under siege from many quarters) never would have
permitted the open circulation of bare-breasted women in postcards.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 (A related domestic postcard strategy covered naked women with white
 powder and posed them as classical statuary.) These norms find distinct
 expression in <I>The Voyage Out</I> in the banishing of a prostitute
 seen late at night in the hotel corridors and in the instant decoding
 of the significance of Susan Warrington and Arthur Venning's first
 embrace: "Well, we may take it for granted that they're engaged,"
 Terence remarks (<I>VO</I>, 130). The frank sexuality attributed
 to non-white women under the cover of the ethnographic alibi
 in postcards provided a form of licensed titillation while also
 throwing into relief the relative virtue of respectable Englishwomen,
 whose sexuality remained bound by marriage. Filtering native life
 through English concerns, other cards reinforced these norms by
 highlighting images of socially-sanctioned sexuality. Card after
 card evinces a need to identify images of far-flung domesticity. A
 representative Cape Town card postmarked July 1908 shows a reclining
 woman breast-feeding a child over the caption "A Native Woman and Child"
 (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_9.html"> 9</A>); an early-century card
 from Lagos (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_0.html"> 10</A>) showing
 a woman holding a small child is labeled "Motherhood." A British
 East African card showing three adults and seven children grouped
 casually on the ground before a hut is labeled "A Kikuyu Family"
 (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_1.html"> 11</A>), but who is to say
 what brought them together in the frame? Like the nostalgic images of
 Edwardian idylls in domestic cards and pastoral novels, the fascination
 with native mothers and families is symptomatic of a cultural need
 to ease anxieties in a time when falling birthrates were thought to
 presage the decline of England's imperial power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Against this backdrop, the potential dissidence of Rachel's desire in
the scene of her engagement and its immediate aftermath becomes all
the more striking. When the excursion party pauses for lunch not long
before arriving at the native village, Rachel and Terence wander together
through an oddly charged landscape in which they kiss for the first time
and thus discover themselves engaged. The nearly surreal

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 64]</B>

quality of the scene clearly derives in part from a resurfacing of the
sexual anxiety Rachel felt in response to Dalloway's kiss. Woolf's
biography offers ample evidence of her own ambivalence toward
heterosexuality, from the sexuality frigidity of her relations with
Leonard to her affairs with other women, and it is easy to discover
similar feelings in the images of churning water that accompany Rachel's
response to her first embrace of Terence: "Terrible--terrible," she
murmurs (<I>VO</I>, 258).
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The churning of Rachel's desire, moreover, recalls the "river torrent"
 in Helen's embroidery, thus underscoring the erotic character of their
 penetration into the jungle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the scene also feels peculiarly dislocated because their engagement
takes place in a jungle landscape that seems at once cleansed of
all meanings and suffused with cultural significance. On one hand,
the alien quality of a world unarticulated by conventional categories
renders the lovers "unable to frame any thoughts" and their voices join
"in tones of strange unfamiliar sound which formed no words" (<I>VO</I>,
258). Seemingly numbed by a world resistant to consciousness, they talk
like aliens encountering the idea of love and marriage for the first
time, and their affectless repetition of conventionally appropriate words
("We love each other") sound like incantations designed to explain their
experience to themselves. On the other hand, their walk through the jungle
is laden with established meanings: Hirst cautions them against snakes,
for instance, and Terence chooses to break the silence by flinging a "red
fruit" into the air and watching it fall to the ground (<I>VO</I>, 257).
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 The implied fall narrative also resonates with crucial moments in
 Rachel's life, thus re-narrativizing a moment of unanchored being
 that would otherwise drift away from plot. To cite just one example
 among many, a path "hedged in by dense creepers" that "burst here
 and there into star-shaped crimson flowers" recalls Rachel's anxious
 vision of her life as "a creeping hedged-in thing" as well as her angry
 response to the disciplining of her body, which "tried to burst forth
 here--there--and was repressed"; the knottedness of the creepers also
 resonates with Rachel's sense that Austen's marriage plots--urged on
 her by Clarissa--are too like a "tight plait" (<I>VO</I>, 257, 245,
 51). The deep tension within the scene thus derives not simply from an
 unresolved wavering between heterosexual and lesbian desire, as many
 critics have argued, but from an encompassing anxiety about <I>any</I>
 fixing of desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only a glimpse of potentially dissident desire survives in the surreal
dislocation of a scene sandwiched between Rachel's engagement and
her entry into the native village. Without warning or explanation "a
hand . . . abrupt as iron" knocks Rachel to the ground; her fragmentary
impressions gradually reveal that Helen is "upon her" rolling her about in
tall grasses that whip across Rachel's eyes and fill her mouth and ears.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The ur-scene in <I>Melymbrosia</I>, a reconstructed earlier version of
 the novel, is much clearer and more explicit: Helen chases after Rachel
 through tall grasses until Rachel suddenly stops to open her arms;
 Helen then rolls her down into the tall grass and proclaims her love.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 <I>Melymbrosia</I>'s intensely realized moment of desire--simultaneously
 lesbian, sororal, and maternal--survives in <I>The Voyage Out</I>
 only in an elliptically ambiguous form: looking up to see Terence and
 Helen standing over her kissing, Rachel raises herself up, and "she too
 realized Helen's soft body" (<I>VO</I>, 269). Although Rachel's embrace
 of Helen moves her in a way Terence's kiss does not, Helen's perspective

<B></B>

(and thus her declaration of love) disappears altogether, leaving only
Rachel's subjectively-rendered experience of confusion, which distorts
potentially errant desires almost beyond recognition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As if confirming her domestication, in the next two paragraphs Rachel
begins to follow Terence's lead, "stopping where he stopped, turning
where he turned, ignorant of the way, ignorant why he stopped or why he
turned" (<I>VO</I>, 250). The process of normalization is completed when
they follow Mr. Flushing into the native village, "falling into line"
in his wake (<I>VO</I>, 259, 269). The domestic tableau they encounter
suggests that all roads now lead to home, "the goal of their journey"
(<I>VO</I>, 270).

 But an instability of the ethnographic frame alters the usual exhibition
 dynamics in a way that comments implicitly on the partial erasure of
 dissident desire in the preceding scenes. Rachel, Terence, Hirst, Helen,
 and the Flushings walk together into the village:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Stepping cautiously, they observed the women, who were squatting on
the ground in triangular shapes, moving their hands, either plaiting
straw or in kneading something in bowls. But when they had looked for
a moment undiscovered, they were seen, and Mr. Flushing, advancing into
the centre of the clearing, was engaged in talk with a lean majestic man,
whose bones and hollows at once made the shapes of the Englishman's body
appear ugly and unnatural. The women took no notice of the strangers,
except that their hands paused for a moment and their long narrow eyes
slid round and fixed upon them with the motionless inexpressive gaze of
those removed from each other far far beyond the plunge of speech. Their
hands moved again, but the stare continued. It followed them as they
walked, as they peered into huts where they could distinguish guns leaning
in the corner. . . . in the dusk the solemn eyes of babies regarded them,
and old women stared out too. As they sauntered about, the stare followed
them, passing over their legs, their bodies, their heads, curiously,
not without hostility, like the crawl of a winter fly. As she drew apart
her shawl and uncovered her breast to the lips of her baby, the eyes of
a woman never left their faces, although they moved uneasily under her
stare, and finally turned away, rather than stand there looking at her any
longer. When sweetmeats were offered them, they put out great red hands
to take them, and felt themselves treading cumbrously like tight-coated
soldiers among these soft instinctive people. [<I>VO</I>, 270]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bennett argues that as exhibition spectators watch one another watch the
spectacle, they become a self-regulating crowd that consolidates its
national identity through their mutual regard (<I>ROM</I>, 69). Here,
confusing pronoun references that Woolf introduced in revision suggest
not a sense of shared English superiority to the "soft instinctive people"
on display, but a breakdown of boundaries between English subject and

<B></B>

native object. By the end of the description of reciprocal staring, the
"they" of "although they moved uneasily under her stare" momentarily
seems to refer back to "the eyes" of the native woman rather than to
the strolling tourists. In the next sentence, the "great red hands"
seem to belong to natives who reach out to accept English confections,
but the next clause reverses the relation by identifying those receiving
the sweetmeats as the tourists, "treading cumbrously like tight-coated
soldiers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Mr. Flushing literalizes the breakdown of the frame by entering the
 clearing, where the contrast between his body and the conventional
 majesty of the noble savage makes the Englishman part of the
 spectacle. Soon afterwards Flushing and his wife acknowledge another
 blurring of boundaries when they question whether the artifacts they
 bought from the natives do not show "signs here and there of European
 influence" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Eventually the rest of the party joins
 Flushing within the frame and is "absorbed" into the life of the village
 (<I>VO</I>, 270). For all but the Flushings, who remain impervious
 to introspection, their absorption into the village coupled with the
 intensity of the returned gaze proves deeply unsettling. Terence and
 Rachel begin to feel "very cold and melancholy"; Hirst feels embittered,
 unhappy, and alone; Helen worries like an anxious mother over "the
 delicate flesh of men and women" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Far from reinforcing
 a sense of racial and cultural superiority, Woolf's exhibition unnerves
 her central characters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Rachel's positioning within the scene of exhibition complicates
Woolf's apparent critique of the imperial hierarchy that normally would
preserve European privilege. On one hand, insofar as the narrative
equates Rachel and the native women, patriarchal and colonial oppression
coincide to produce a critique of colonialism. On the other hand, by
transforming the native women into a mere backdrop for Rachel's inner
drama, Woolf partially reproduces the imperial hierarchy the novel
otherwise attacks. These claims require more detailed attention.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf clearly indicates that the gender politics informing Rachel's life
also govern the native village. Like the description of Rachel and Terence
moving into the uncanny space of their engagement, the expedition party's
movement into the native village weaves together phrases linked to the
marriage plot that has increasingly circumscribed Rachel's life. The
women's "plaiting of straw," for instance, echoes the knotted creepers
binding the trees at the site of Rachel's engagement as well as Austen's
"tight plait." The image recurs after they return from the expedition
and sit listening in the afternoon heat to Terence reading aloud Milton's
marriage masque, <I>Comus</I>: the water nymph "sitting / Under the glassy
cool translucent wave, / in <I>twisted braids</I> of lilies knitting /
the loose train" of her hair gives Rachel the headache that portends her
protracted death over the last three chapters of the novel (<I>VO</I>,
310). As water laps at the foot of Rachel's bed during her first day
of fever, these lines haunt her, suggesting both the symbolic threat
of Milton (author of the first domestic epic) and the more palpable
threat of domestic life with Terence. Before the engagement Evelyn says
approvingly that there's "something of a woman" in Terence (<I>VO</I>,
235), but afterwards he tries to silence Rachel's music by suggesting
that her playing of a Beethoven sonata is unnatural.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Similar gender politics obtain in the native village. In
 <I>Melymbrosia</I> the

<B></B>

native women carry goods back and forth to Mr. Flushing; but when
Mr. Flushing moves into the clearing to conduct business in <I>The
Voyage Out</I>, the native women remain literally and ratively at
the periphery. The implied structural parallel between Rachel and the
native women suggests an equality in subjection.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the scene of exhibition also positions Rachel and her fellow travelers
as involuntary agents of the dominant powers to which Rachel typically
feels subjected. Clearly accustomed to the European stare, the women
are just one more stop on a well-trodden path. When Hirst sees deer
bounding away from the riverbank as they approach the native village,
he laments having left his Kodak behind, even though his camera would
simply literalize the framing power the tourists already possess. Even
Rachel's identification with the women implies a reassertion of her
hierarchical advantage. Intuiting her affinities with them, Rachel has a
vision of eternal stasis: "So it would go on for ever and ever, she said,
those women sitting under the trees, the trees and the river" (<I>VO</I>,
271). As Rachel begins to see herself as a woman destined to have a child
at her breast and a sewing kit on her lap, her married future is mapped
onto the colonized, who become a kind of colonial-domestic hallucination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As both resistant bodies and hallucinations, the native women occupy a
curiously contradictory place in the logic of the narrative. The flicker
of independent subjectivity in the unsettling force of their stare
renders them semi-autonomous beings, subject to but not wholly dominated
by the tourists who gaze at the human showcase. But as emblems of female
abjection and the normalization of desire, they merge into the cycles of
nature. Rachel thus becomes not only the colonized woman subject to the
framing power of English patriarchy but also the colonizing woman with
a monopoly on the power of articulation: while Rachel formulates them
with a phrase, the "motionless inexpressive" women remain "removed from
each other far far beyond the plunge of speech" (<I>VO</I>, 270). At
once the photographer and the photographed, Rachel is implicated, even
as she turns away, in a form of power she cannot escape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such unresolved tensions in <I>The Voyage Out</I> help to make visible
comparable moments in colonial postcards. Woolf's interest in the
interplay between the represented and the representer and between the
representation and the spectator emerges distinctly in an earlier
description of a photograph of Rachel's dead mother: "The need of
sitting absolutely still before a Cockney photographer had given her
lips a queer little pucker, and her eyes for the same reason looked
as though she thought the whole situation ridiculous" (<I>VO</I>,
78). The women in colonial postcards can also seem to transgress
the boundaries of the frame, particularly when the returned stare,
"not without hostility," expresses a distinct sense of the model's
dismay over her enforced pose (<I>VO</I>, 270). Consider again some
of the postcards discussed earlier. In "The Toilet: Zulu Girls" (<A
HREF="8.1wollaeger_6.html">6</A> the apprehensive yet sullen stare
of the woman made to stage her toilet for the camera radiates resentment
toward the viewer peering in over the photographer's shoulder. Faced
with such a look, one can understand the discomfort of Helen, who blames
the Flushings "for having come on this expedition, for having ventured
too far and exposed themselves" (<I>VO</I>, 271). Although Helen never
explains the precise nature of this exposure, she evidently feels they
have all become vulnerable simply by

<B></B>

opening themselves to the stare of the women. In <I>Melymbrosia</I>,
in contrast, the "eyes seemed to follow them <I>without</I> hostility"
(<I>M</I>, 211; emphasis added). Viewed in this light, the Boran beauty
photographed in Kenya (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_5.html">5</A>
can be seen to challenge the postcard's aesthetic-ethnographic alibi:
her braceleted wrists pressed together and her sad countenance begin
to suggest a handcuffed captive trapped by the power relations that
placed her before the camera. More militant, the "Bella India" of Peru
(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_7.html">7</A> defies the scopic regime
of colonialism with an accusatory stare that demands reciprocal exposure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the benefit of hindsight, one can read in the penetrating gaze
returned in such cards signs of the resistance that would ultimately
culminate in rebellious new nationalisms. This anticipatory reading
accords with Woolf's fantasy of the end of empire at Wembley as she
watches the rain whip through the exhibition grounds. In both cases,
carefully arranged scenes of imperial superiority become self-subverting
when elements refuse to remain neatly in the frame: the sky will not
lie back "limp" and "acquiescent" at the fair grounds; the glimpse
of independent subjectivity in the eyes of native women disrupts
colonialism's aestheticizing of its own power. Insofar as the unstable
relation between autonomous beings and hallucinatory projections places
Woolf's novel and the postcards in a mutually illuminating relationship,
this instability is critically productive: the postcards highlight the
pressure of normalization within Woolf's representation of the native
women even as their challenging stare breaks through the Orientalism of
the postcards, now seen to anticipate a postcolonial desire to shatter
the frame.

7. Race and the Emancipation of Women
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To return to the question with which I began: can an Englishwoman
colonized under patriarchy avoid becoming a colonizer in her turn? The
answer returned by <I>The Voyage Out</I>, unlike any other in Woolf,
turns on the way Rachel's complex positioning within the novel's
climactic scene of exhibition illuminates a critical hesitation in Woolf's
understanding of race. It would be easy to criticize Woolf for a form of
"white solipsism" that "passively colludes with a racist culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Certainly one would be hard pressed to find in her fiction any of
 the cross-racial masquerades that recent criticism has linked to the
 emergence of Anglo-American modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Indeed, if the dubious image of Woolf in blackface during the Dreadnought
 hoax is any gauge, racial masquerade for her was simply a masquerade,
 a prank rather than a strategic racial repositioning in relation to
 dominant society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 But the singularity of Woolf's treatment of race in <I>The
 Voyage Out</I>--the way in which it strains <I>against</I> racial
 self-enclosure--emerges distinctly against the background of her later
 writing. Consider a 1925 diary entry in which Woolf describes giving
 a biscuit to a little girl who reminds her of herself; moments later
 she looks down from a bus at "a nigger gentleman, perfectly fitted
 out in swallow tail &amp; bowler &amp; gold headed cane." Clearly he
 is as improbable for Woolf as the Zulu Masher must have been for its
 intended audience (<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_4.html">4</A>. "What
 were his thoughts?" Woolf wonders. Her speculative response charts a
 racial gulf. Was

<B></B>

he thinking, she muses, "of the degradation stamped on him, every time
he raised his hand &amp; saw it black as a monkeys outside, tinged with
flesh colour within?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Woolf's ability to imagine other minds in this entry clearly turns more
 on race than on gender, and the stark dichotomy between racial opacity
 and transparency throws into relief the relative complexity of <I>The
 Voyage Out</I>, which remains suspended between imperial objectification
 and intimations of an equivalent center of self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The singularity of <I>The Voyage Out</I> can be further clarified
in relation to a little-discussed moment in <I>A Room of One's
Own</I>. Following her famous discussion of Shakespeare's martyred sister,
Woolf turns to women's historical need to remain chaste, where chastity
refers to the preservation of anonymity as a defense against a public
life dominated by men. The idea of chastity already looks back to <I>The
Voyage Out</I>, in which Rachel's death can be construed as an attempt
to remain chaste, a point underlined by Woolf's use of <I>Comus</I>. But
a racially-grounded connection between <I>The Voyage Out</I> and <I>A
Room of One's Own</I> becomes more striking when Woolf explains how
women differ from men: men have a need for publicity and ownership--of a
passing woman, a dog, "a piece of land or a man with curly black hair. It
is one of the great advantages of being a woman that one can pass even
a very fine negress without wishing to make an Englishwoman of her."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However ironic the tone or humorous the intent (and the word "even"
implies a familiar Bloomsbury archness), this last sentence clearly
replays the key scene in Woolf's native village. In both cases, a mobile
white woman passes by a motionless black woman who becomes a passive
object of the white woman's purportedly benign gaze, and race provides
a way to think gender. In <I>A Room of One's Own</I> the silent black
body serves simultaneously to define the relative emancipation of white
women while absolving them of the guilt of colonialism: <I>men</I> want
to own the "negress" by assimilating her, women don't. Woolf returns to
this blunt disavowal in <I>Three Guinea</I>'s vision of an Outsider's
Society of women who would shun "all such ceremonies as encourage the
desire to impose 'our' civilization or 'our' dominion upon other people"
(<I>TG</I>, 109). In <I>The Voyage Out</I> Rachel, like Woolf, discovers
her identity as a woman by measuring herself against a racial other. One
expects in imperial romance to find metropolitan subjects discovering
images of their own desire at the boundaries of civilization. But
in <I>The Voyage Out</I> Rachel finds an image of what <I>others</I>
desire <I>for her</I>. Passing by, she discovers not her freedom but
her constraint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Killing Rachel off, Woolf responds to Rachel's resistance to becoming both
subject and object of imperialism by removing her from a dichotomy that is
fundamental to all forms of hierarchy. Woolf's later efforts to collapse
subject-object relations, most explicitly in <I>To the Lighthouse</I>,
remain on the plane of philosophy and aesthetic expression, perhaps
because her first effort to work through the distinction in the context
of race, patriarchy, and empire ends in a dispiriting reassertion of
oppressive norms. Ironically, it is Helen, Rachel's would-be mentor,
who sees most clearly into the cultural claustrophobia she unwittingly
heightens: "It seemed to [Helen] that a moment's respite was allowed
. . . and then again the profound and reasonless law asserted itself,
moulding them all to its liking" (<I>VO</I>, 250; ellipsis added). In
<I>The Voyage Out</I> Woolf

<B></B>

proposes multiple candidates for the reasonless law: imperialism,
patriarchy, capitalism, heteronormativity, and their tendency to reinforce
one another. When Hirst settles back comfortably to watch "the pattern
build itself up" after Rachel's death, "pattern" evokes an almost
paranoid vision of cultural and political interconnection (<I>VO</I>,
354). Linking the Thames to the waters of the Amazon, the circulation of
picture postcards operates as a metonymy for this dystopian consolidation,
one in which the world is constituted, as Richard Dalloway would have it,
as England's object.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It would be easy to dismiss Woolf's analogy between the bodies of
European and third-world women in <I>The Voyage Out</I>, not to mention
her suggestion that Helen's "profound and reasonless law" can sum up
everything from globalization to the shaping power of sexual norms
(<I>VO</I>, 250). Yet it is this vision of overdetermined global
domestication that pushes Woolf toward her most provocative encounter
with empire. For even as the rest of the novel discounts the possibility
of stepping beyond one's own culture, Woolf struggles to find a way
for Rachel to identify with the native women without finding herself
complicit in their subjection. Although Woolf's use of race as a stage
on which to understand gender partially reproduces colonial ideology
by remaking the natives in Rachel's image, the faint acknowledgment of
the native women's perspective in the momentary glimpse of the tourists
as "tight-coated soldiers" keeps her from becoming a subtler version
of Evelyn, who imagines herself a great captain "sent to colonise the
world" (<I>VO</I>, 251-52). That trace of autonomous subjectivity
also suggests Woolf's desire to grasp what she fails to imagine in her
diary entry and her subsequent fiction: an acknowledgment of racial
difference that remains untainted by hierarchy. It seems that what
Woolf wants to effect in the native village but cannot is a suspension
of imperial ideology in the act of representing it, or what Althusser
called the internal distanciation of ideology. Instead, by populating
the blank spots in her own private South America with postcard images,
Woolf infects Rachel with a fatal strain of the cultural disease James
Douglas saw spreading across the globe: Rachel can't help either stepping
into a picture postcard or snapping one.

LuAnn McCracken, who focuses on the maternal in relation to the formation
of Rachel's identity, notes that Rachel's experience in the native village
has received surprisingly little attention; Laura Doyle, one of the few
critics to take up McCracken's challenge, persuasively links Rachel's
"substitution of a man for a mother" to a corresponding substitution of
"racial difference for gender solidarity," but her excellent discussion
focuses primarily on <I>Melymbrosia</I>, an earlier version of the novel,
not on the much more developed scene in the published text of <I>The
Voyage Out</I>. No one else, to my knowledge, has discussed the role of
race. See LuAnn McCracken, "'The synthesis of my being': Autobiography

<I>PPO</I>. The golden age of the picture postcard in England is usually
thought to begin in 1899, when changes in British postal regulations
permitted the standard-sized card to circulate freely, and to end with
World War I in 1918, when postal rates doubled and the exuberantly
colored cards of the <I>belle &eacute;poque</I> gave way to the dull
sepia tints of the bleak post-war years. See Anthony Byatt, <I>Picture

If Woolf visited London's Imperial International Exhibition 1909, her
impressions of it are not extant. Yet in her account of the British Empire
Exhibition, "Thunder at Wembley," Woolf notes that "At Earls Court and the
White City, <I>so far as memory serves</I>, there was little trouble from
[nature]" (<I>EOVW</I>, 3: 411; emphasis added). The White City was first
built for the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition and then refurbished for the
1909 exhibition, the first international exhibition held in London since
the Great Exhibitions of 1851 and 1861. Woolf also refers to the Earls
Court Exhibition facilities in her letters and essays. See <I>EOVW</I>,

Originally brought to the New World by West African slaves, the banjo
entered into white urban culture in the mid-nineteenth century via
minstrel shows and enjoyed a craze in England and America from about
1890 to 1930. The popularity of minstrel shows evidently transformed the
banjo into a signifier of blackness, for by the late nineteenth century,
as the banjo began to be incorporated into light classical music,
Joel Chandler Harris (author of the Uncle Remus tales) felt compelled
to minimize the slave origins of the instrument in a controversial
article in <I>The Critic</I> in 1883. See Jay Scot Odell, "Banjo,"

An inscription on the back of the West African card entitled "Motherhood"
(<A HREF="8.1wollaeger_0.html">10</A> testifies to a related
anxiety: "Dear Kath, Isn't this friccan nice. If they only stayed
like this. Love Auntie Bell." Possibly the West African woman prompted
Auntie Bell to bemoan the exhausting and largely female labor of child
rearing. But the remark also bespeaks an English need to assert imperial
control over subject races, here expressed as the desire to make Africa
truly be, as Hegel claimed it was, "the land of childhood . . . lying
beyond the days of self-conscious history." See G. W. F. Hegel,
<I>Philosophy of History</I>, quoted in <I>The Post-Colonial Studies
Reader</I>, ed. Bill Ashcrost, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin (London
and New York: Routledge, 1995), 15. Nigeria would not be born for another
sixty years, but already, with images of West African women and children
flowing into England, boundaries between domestic and the colonial spaces
were eroding, and the casual ugliness of Auntie Bell's remark discloses
British anxieties about what it would mean to let these subject people
reproduce, in freedom.

Sander Gilman's persuasive argument that nineteenth-century perceptions
of racial otherness and inferiority were typically projected onto
the image of the sexualized black woman provides a suggestive context
for the telos of Rachel's journey. On one hand, the longstanding link
between untrammeled sexuality and blacks underscores through antithesis
the domestic binding of female sexuality in Woolf's native village. On
the other hand, late nineteenth-century representations of the sexualized
black female as "the source of corruption and disease" suggest a submerged
symbolic linkage between Rachel's entry into the village and the fever
that kills her. See Sander Gilman, "Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an
Iconography of Female Sexuality in Late Nineteenth-Century Art, Medicine,

For the history of Woolf's multiple manuscripts and revisions,
see DeSalvo, <I>Virginia Woolf's First Voyage</I>. The scene in
<I>Melymbrosia</I> is much shorter and simpler (the description of the
women is about a third as long) and focuses much more on the purchase
of artifacts than on the tourist's elusive emotional response to the
encounter; Rachel feels her happiness "dashed" after looking at the
women, explaining to Terence that "it makes us seem so small," but the
comparatively flat and undeveloped scene does not describe anyone else's
reactions (<I>M</I>, 212). The amplification and increasing complication
of the scene in revision carries considerable biographical resonance:
Woolf rewrote the scene after she became engaged to Leonard Woolf and
as she was reading the manuscript of his first novel, <I>The Village
in the Jungle</I> (London: Eward Arnold, 1913), which recounts stories
of mismatched couples, sadism, and doomed wives in the exotic jungles
of Ceylon. Like <I>The Voyage Out</I>, <I>The Village in the Jungle</I>

toward two native sisters who were apparently modeled on Virginia and
her sister Vanessa.

By comparing Rachel's playing to "an unfortunate old dog going round

long line of canine denigration of women that Woolf, citing Nick Greene,

The parallel between Rachel and the native women is anticipated earlier
in the novel by a complex allusion to <I>Heart of Darkness</I> in which
a letter from Rachel's father, described in a Conradian turn of phrase as
"robbing a whole continent of mystery" (<I>VO</I>, 182), echoes Marlow's
encounter with an accountant who has forced native women to learn how to
wash and starch his shirts and collars. Just as Woolf insistently links
micro and macro politics, Conrad connects the imposition of domestic labor

however, points out that the conjunction of class and race in the
hoax--they dress as royalty after all--complicates Kathy Phillips's
claim that the African costume betokens Woolf's identification with
oppressed groups. See Jean E. Kennard, "Power and Sexual Ambiguity: The

How admiringly the officer in the penal colony surveys his instrument
of execution. With what zeal he explains its mechanism. Curator that he
is, he carefully avoids touching the surface of the Old Commandant's
drawings. But how lovingly he traces their pattern in the air. The
visiting researcher, the voyager, cannot read the script that the officer
marks for him, but he understands the performance enough to return the
compliment that the officer's gestures demand. He says "evasively,"
of the drawings and the script, "It's very artistic" (<I>Es ist sehr
kunstvoll</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  "Yes," said the officer with a laugh, putting the folder away again,
  "it's no copy-book lettering [<I>keine Sch&ouml;nschrift</I>] for
  school children" ("IPC" 135 [159]). The officer's gestures establish a
  context for judging his beloved Commandant's apparatus: it should be
  viewed, or read, as a work of art. He wants this machine to be seen,
  however, not merely as one specific artwork but as the very form of
  art in general. He constantly insists on the transferability of what
  is "artistic" from one domain of technique to another. The component
  of the machine that writes on or, better, stabs into the condemned is
  like a farm implement, a harrow, but with a critical difference. This
  particular harrow, the officer claims, a piece of glass, performs with
  far greater artistry than does any ordinary farmer's tool; it is much
  more artful (<I>viel kunstgem&auml;&szlig;er</I>) ("IPC" 129 [153]).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many critics, including Stanley Corngold, have usefully explored how the
penal apparatus represents the art of writing itself, but in the story
the officer makes an even bigger claim than do the critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  For him, the apparatus represents not merely writing, but "art." Central
  features of "art-making," he suggests, pertain to widely diverse
  technical practices: farming, writing,

<B></B>

punishment, and drawing. The voyager notices the implication of the
officer's views and asks of the Old Commandant, "Did he then combine
everything in his own person? Was he soldier, judge, engineer, chemist,
and cartoonist [<I>Zeichner</I>]?" ("IPC" 131 [155]). Indeed, he
did. Above all, however, the Commandant was a technician; the officer,
curator of his superior's works of art. Kafka's "In the Penal Colony"
ruminates on punishment's status as an art, and therefore dwells also,
through its insistence on the transferability of "artfulness" between
media, on the dismal possibility that all arts contain an element of
punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer guides the voyager (or hopes to guide him) through an
appreciation of the texts and visual signs of the apparatus. He wants
him to learn to read the machine. But the officer also regularly and
insistently leads the researcher through an experience of sounds,
particularly the sound of silence. When the officer describes the sort
of reading a condemned man is supposed to do--he is supposed to read his
sentence in his body--the officer says that the condemned "purses his
lips as if he were listening. You've seen that it isn't easy to decipher
the script with one's eyes; but our man deciphers it with his wounds" (Es
geschieht ja weiter nichts, der Mann f&auml;ngt blo&szlig; an, die Schrift
zu entziffern, er spitzt den Mund, als horche er) ("IPC" 137 [160]). His
wounds seem to make some sound to the condemned and so reading becomes
listening. But what sound is there in pain? In <I>The Body in Pain</I>
Elaine Scarry has argued that pain itself is inherently aphasic because
it is impossible to vocalize any precise or meaningful calculus of pain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Momentarily I will analyze the sounds that the condemned hears but first
it is crucial to consider how his wounding sounds to the onlookers. As the
officer rhapsodizes the process of the execution in the days of the Old
Commandant, the focus is as much on what can be heard as on what is seen:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Before hundreds of pairs of eyes--all the spectators standing on tiptoe
right up to the top of the slopes--the condemned man was laid under the
harrow by the commandant himself. . . . And then the execution began! No
discordant note disturbed the working of the machine [Kein Mi&szlig;ton
st&ouml;rte die Arbeit der Maschine]. Many [of the spectators from the
penal colony] even ceased to watch and lay with their eyes closed in
the sand; all of them knew: Now justice is taking its course [Jetzt
geschieht Gerechtigkeit]." ["IPC" 140 ]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Justice takes its course quietly and, more importantly, as quiet<I>.</I>
Punishment is, Kafka suggests, the art of sounding silence. In the old
days, all of the spectators knew, as they lay with their eyes closed
in the sand, that punishment's point lay also in its sounds. In this,
the essential feature of the apparatus is not the bed, not the designer,
not the harrow, but the felt stub (<I>Filzstumpf</I>), the revolting
silencer. In the officer's first description of the felt, he says
"it can be easily adjusted to push straight into the man's mouth," and
its "object is to prevent screaming." The greatest artfulness in the
apparatus lies in precisely its mechanisms for producing silence. And
since "In the Penal Colony" insists on the transferability of "artfulness"
from one domain of technique to another, Kafka's worries about silence,
in this story, must extend to other arts as well.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To return to the officer who manipulates and aspires to produce silence,
he too has worries about the silence that is his medium. He suspects
that the silence surrounding his machine in the penal colony may no
longer reflect acquiescence in, awe at, and fear of the forms of justice
enacted by the machine but rather his, and the machine's, complete
irrelevance. Indeed, Kafka uses the phrase, "<I>in der Strafkolonie</I>,"
in the first paragraph of the story in order to report that there is now,
under the New Commandant, diminished interest in the inventions of the
former regime ["Das Interesse f&uuml;r diese Exekution war wohl auch in
der Strafkolonie nicht sehr gro&szlig;"] ("IPC" 127 [151]). The officer
is not only the sole member of the colony to defend the apparatus, but
he is also, and more forcefully, solitary in his sustained interest in it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The officer is not, however, completely convinced that the new kind
 of silence should be heard as disinterest. Just before he describes
 how the spectators formerly buried their eyes in the sand to listen
 to the machine--that is, in the first half of the same paragraph--he
 addresses this second type, the silence of disinterest, and claims that
 the people of the colony only <I>pretend</I> not to care. He claims that,
 "although no one will admit it, there are still plenty of supporters
 of the Old Commandant" ("IPC" 139).

&Auml;u&szlig;erungen h&ouml;ren]. They'd all of them be supporters,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From silence in the valley to quiet doublemeanings in the tea room; how
different these silences are. The artist-officer aspires to reproduce
the silence of admiration, fear, and acquiescence, but faces instead the
dismaying silence of irrelevance. "In the Penal Colony," then, turns on
the equivocal (<I>zweideutige</I>) nature of silence, and on the tension
between silences that acquiesce or say yes, and those that say no, or,
what is the same, it doesn't matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Silence is relevant to "In the Penal Colony" in two modes: as yes and
as no--the absolutely opposed sounds of silence. This equivocation in
silence comes through most clearly in the story's climax, its moment
of superlative punishment, when the officer subjects himself to his own
justice. Then the machine begins to work on its own, like an apparatus
of the divine, yes, a <I>deus ex machina.</I> After he strips and is
strapped to the bed by the soldier and the condemned man, the officer
cannot hit the machine's crank to start it, but it doesn't matter.

The bed vibrated, the needles danced over the skin, the harrow moved
gently up and down. The voyager had been staring at it for some time
before it occurred to him that a wheel in the designer should have been
grating; and yet all was still, not even the faintest whirring could
be heard. As a result of this silent working the machine positively
escaped attention [Der Reisende hatte schon eine Weile hingestarrt,
ehe er sich erinnerte, da&szlig; 

<B></B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something about the officer's unspoken confession and his decision
to punish himself achieves at least the formal perfection of the
Commandant's penal regime: total silence. But to know what is perfect
about this peculiar punishment, and whether or why Kafka frets about it,
it is necessary to understand the judgment that precedes it, for there
has indeed been a judgment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Quite early in the story, the voyager intuits that he has been delegated
by the New Commandant of the colony to judge his predecessor's penal
apparatus. Nonetheless he worries that any criticism of the machine
will provoke the colonists to respond, "You are a stranger, hold your
peace." During their discussion at the scene of execution, the officer
makes the voyager's status as judge explicit, and he also spells out more
precisely the questions of voice and silence at issue in the trial of
the machine. He desperately wants the voyager, not to hold his peace,
but to call out an appeal on behalf of the officer in the court of
public opinion. He wants this in order to prove that the silence around
the machine is still definitive of its power, and not a mark of its
impotence. It's therefore the machine's production of silence that must
be judged by the voyager. He must determine whether the apparatus cranks
out yes's or no's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer imagines that the judgment of his machine might take one
of two possible courses. The researcher might return to town after
the execution and talk about the machine, or he might return and be
silent. The officer expects the respective outcomes of speech and silence
to be radically different. If the voyager should return to town and
drop a chance remark such as "We only used torture in the Middle Ages,"
the officer expects to see the New Commandant, upon hearing this remark,

pushing his chair aside and rushing out on to the balcony, I can see
his ladies streaming out after him, I can hear his voice--the ladies
call it a voice of thunder [<I>ich h&ouml;re seine Stimme--die Damen
nennen sie eine Donnerstimme</I>]--and what he now says goes like this:
"A famous researcher from the West . . . has just said that our own
procedure . . . is inhumane. Given this verdict [<I>Urteil</I>] . . .,
I naturally cannot tolerate this procedure any longer. With effect from
today I therefore ordain--etc. [<I>und so weiter</I>]" ["IPC" 142 ]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka need not divulge <I>what</I> he will ordain; the content of the
Law doesn't matter, only its process, and so the sentence concludes with
"and so on." Only the form of verdicts and pronouncements matters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Should the commandant pronounce his new ordinance, his authoritative voice
of power would be laid over the researcher's interpretative voice. About
this, the officer says, "You will want to cry out [that you never
gave such a verdict] but a lady's hand covers your mouth. . ." ("IPC"
143). In this first account of the course of justice, the voyager's
failure to keep his silence about the machine paves the way for the
voice of thunder, the sounds that smash (this is Jehovah's voice). The
apparatus's brutal silencing

<B></B>

power will be replaced by a lady's--also brutal as represented
here--palm. In this scenario, the silence produced by the apparatus is
one of irrelevance, weaker even than a woman's hand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his second scenario of the course of justice, the officer imagines
that if the voyager should initially hold his peace, the reverse effects
will obtain.

Unless you are asked directly, you should on no account express an
opinion; but what you do say must be brief and non-committal; it
should appear that you find it hard to discuss the matter, that you
feel embittered, that if you were to speak openly you would almost start
cursing and swearing. . . . [<I>man soll merken, da&szlig; es Ihnen schwer
wird, dar&uuml;ber zu sprechen, da&szlig; Sie verbittert sind, da&szlig;
Sie, falls Sie offen reden sollten, geradezu in Verw&uuml;nschungen

them to recognize, is of course amply justified, but not in the way the
commandant imagines. He will naturally misunderstand it completely and
interpret it to suit his own book. That's what my plan depends on [Er
nat&uuml;rlich wird es vollst&auml;ndig mi&szlig;verstehen und in seinem
Sinne deuten. Darauf gr&uuml;ndet sich mein Plan]. ["IPC" 144 ]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer's plan rests firmly on silence's shiftiness and equivocation,
and on the interchangeability of yes and no. He expects that the New
Commandant, taking silence for criticism, will invite the researcher
to speak before the assembled public, not recognizing that his
silence actually implies an affirmation of the machine. Once given
the opportunity to speak, the voyager will, the officer hopes, make
a passionate appeal for the machine; this defense of the apparatus
will then be followed by the officer's own. The officer promises, "If
my speech doesn't drive him out of the hall, it will force him to his
knees, so that he has to confess: Old Commandant, to your power I bow"
("IPC" 145). Here the power of the officer's fantasies about voice,
silence, and potency become clearer. The officer expects to use silence
to prepare an appeal that will in turn silence others. He appeals for a
spoken defense that will confirm the power of the silences produced by
the machine. But his appeal for an appeal, his call for a voice to set
against thunder, is rejected. When the officer asks, "That is my plan;
are you willing to help me carry it out?" the voyager responds, simply,
"No" ("IPC" 146). This verdict on silence defines the silence around the
machine as that of irrelevance and thus convicts the officer, machine,
and Old Commandant not of injustice, but of impotence. It is precisely
because the story is interested in force--not in justice--that it is
difficult to read it politically.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now condemned, the officer has himself been silenced; his case is closed
by a no that came in place of yes. What happens next in the story unfolds
"as if" of necessity; silence is, of course, at the heart of it all. In
response to the no, the officer is silent, and blinks several times with
his eyes fixed on the voyager. The latter asks if the officer wants
an explanation. "The officer nods silently" ("IPC" 146). The voyager
provides an explanation and

you?" he murmur[s], smiling as an old man smiles at the nonsense of a
child. . . . "Then the time has come." ["IPC" 146]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, the officer begins to prepare his own punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, one could say that self-imposed punishment, that which is no
imposition, is no penalty, and that instinct or intuition whittles the
beginning of this scene of punishment to a single detail.

<!--_extract-->
He only had to stretch out a hand towards the harrow for it to raise
and lower itself several times, until it reached the right position to
receive him; he merely gripped the edge of the bed and it began at once
to vibrate; the felt stub came to meet his mouth, one could see that the
officer did not actually want it, but his hesitation lasted only for a
moment, he quickly submitted and accepted it. All was now ready, only
the straps were still hanging down at the sides, but these were clearly
unnecessary, the officer had no need to be fastened down. ["IPC" 150]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only the felt stub is unwanted. Almost imperceptible is his hesitation
before it. Almost imperceptible is the punishment it enforces. The art
of the machine is in forcing the convict to take this felt. Remember
that the first time the officer had described the felt, he remarked,
"Its object is to prevent screaming and biting of the tongue. The man
is bound to take the felt of course, since otherwise his neck would be
broken by the neck strap" ("IPC" 130). The force of this transaction
precedes what "counts" as the force of punishment, the actual inscription
of the body. Through the felt, the machine manipulates psychology as
well as physiology; it is not merely the body, as so many have argued,
that feels the force of the apparatus' punishment; it is also the voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Andreas Gailus calls the "somatization" of the ideologies inscribed
by the machine, the transformation of ideologemes, like "honor thy
superiors," into bodily matter also involves teaching the psyche, in the
form of the voice, that it cannot escape the body. The second time the
officer remarks on the felt stub, he says of it, "After two hours, the
felt stub is removed, for the man no longer has the strength to scream"
("IPC" 136). This is the point at which the condemned begins listening to
his wounds, which means "pursing his lips" as if he were listening. The
opaque script is as good as silence, and the condemned comes to know
voicelessness, the incapacity to contest meaning. The condemned knows
he is beyond the realm of disagreement or acquiescence--here is his
enlightenment (<I>Verstand</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In focusing on the role of silence in punishment, Kafka has noticed
something about the practice of punishment that even the master
interpreter of its meaning-making functions missed. In <I>Discipline and
Punish</I> Michel Foucault famously elaborates the transition from the
royal punishments, the spectacles of power and torture of the body of
the eighteenth century, to the democratic penitentiary and the discipline
of the soul of the liberal nineteenth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  He frames the book's argument with two examples, an account of the
  1757 execution of a regicide and a list of rules for young prisoners

<B></B>

from 1837. Notable in both stories, although Foucault does not note it,
is the amount of attention paid to voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The eyewitness to the eighteenth-century execution carefully records when
screams, pleas, and curses were expected from the condemned, and when they
in fact occurred. Near the end of his account, the witness reports this,
"When the four limbs had been pulled away, the confessors came to speak
to him; but his executioner told him that he was dead, though the truth
was that I saw the man move, his lower jaw moving from side to side as
if he were talking" (<I>DP</I> 5). The narrative of the execution is
structured by a concern for what happens with the man's voice, not merely
his body. Similarly, the list of rules for young prisoners begins with the
requirement that "At first drum-roll, [they] rise and dress in silence,"
and concludes with the injunction that after the convicts go to bed at
the end of the day, "the cell doors are closed and the supervisors go
the rounds in the corridors, to ensure order and silence" (<I>DP</I>
6-7). Silence is as central to the punishment Foucault describes,
whether royalist or democratic, as to Kafka's, but his own account misses
the definitive element of punishment in a variety of Western cultures,
though it is institutionalized differently in each.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Punishment seeks to control not merely the body in the one case and the
soul in the other, <I>but always the voice.</I> The condemned are those
and only those who have exhausted their appeals, their calling out, or,
as in "In the Penal Colony," have been prevented from calling out at
all. They are permitted no defense and are denied even the opportunity
to cry out. Their conviction stands, and with it the regime's narrative
of who and what they are. Only silence can secure the meaning of a
punishment, which always at some level means "a final answer." Silence
must therefore fall on a punishment if it is to succeed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, there are differences in the types of silence demanded by
monarchic spectacle and by liberal discipline and observation. The
monarchs Foucault describes want silence only after they have extracted
particular kinds of sounds--notes of confession, tones of guilt,
cries for pardon--but they do in the end wish to still the wagging
jaw. Monarchic punishment wants the "quieting" to be <I>seen</I> so
that royal force will be felt. Democratic punishment, in contrast,
wants not a full performance of the death of voice, but, simply,
silence. Since democratic punishments, in contrast to monarchic ones,
rest on the fiction that the polity's laws and punishments reflect the
perfect consent of the citizenry (rather than on force), silence is all
the more imperative in a democracy. Silence after punishment signifies the
end of contest; it seems to make sensible a general communal acquiescence
in the methods of making meaning that (claim to) have brought closure
to the case of a given criminal. Silence implies first acquiescence,
then consent. The U.S. has recently introduced what are being called
maxi-maxi prisons, where prisoners suffer solitary confinement in
"administrative segregation" for violations of prison regulations
committed while in other prisons. The most striking feature of these
prisons is the noise that fills their hallways: a cacophony of shouts,
groans, bellows, rattling of door handles, and banging of possessions
against walls. No less striking to the observer is the silence that falls
when the doors to the prison are closed and one stands outside its walls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In monarchies, silence

<B></B>

is proof of force; the democratic silence makes all citizens complicit
in punishment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Kafka is indubitably right to represent punishment by depicting
  silence. And thus music seems to be exactly the wrong genre for thinking
  about punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or does it? Perhaps it seems wrong only if one employs a limited idea
of what silence is. The third time the officer describes the work done
by the piece of felt, he refines his account of silence. Recall the
scene where the officer contrasts the silence of his contemporaries'
meaningless chitchat in the tearoom to the sort of silence the colonists
used to experience at an execution:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And then the execution began! No jarring sound [discordant note] disturbed
the working of the machine. Many even ceased to watch and lay with their
eyes closed in the sand; all of them knew: Now justice is taking its
course. In the silence, nothing could be heard but the moaning of the
condemned man, half muffled by the felt. Nowadays the machine cannot
wring from the man any groans that are too loud for the felt to stifle;
but in those days a corrosive fluid that we are no longer permitted to
use dripped from the inscribing needles. ["IPC" 140]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The harrow and the felt do not collaborate merely in order to silence;
their art is more diabolical. They first provoke the condemned to voice,
and then silence him. When the people in the penal colony lie down,
closing their eyes in the sand, to listen, they are listening to the
performance of silence, to groans stifled. Silence is surely not the
absence of sound--aren't there always at least rattling leaves, scratching
pens, and purring hard drives, or one's own heart--silence must more
particularly be the absence of voices that summon our attention. The
penal apparatus therefore <I>orchestrates</I> the force of voice, and
its death, its final descent into silence. The colonists are listening to
an opera. And so music is not, after all, the wrong art for representing
punishment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But where does this leave writing, for this is the art that most critics
believe Kafka to be representing (along with his anxieties about it) in
"In the Penal Colony." I do not mean to erase "writing" with the word
"music," nor to suggest that one mode of performance can simply substitute
for another. But the story does lead to the conclusion that the art of
punishment and the art of music both express something frightful about
art per se. The machine writes not just to inscribe, but to provoke the
very groans that it silences. If writing is the subject of "In the Penal
Colony," then it is specifically the kind that aspires to silence others
and, perhaps, also its author.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's representation of the penal apparatus lays bare, naked and
acquiescent, as the re of the officer, the aspiration of art to be
definitive. Over and over we hear in the critical literature that the term
"Kafkaesque" has come to define the modern, or even postmodern situation:
"Kafka is in the air," says political theorist Jane Bennett in a 1994
article.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

  The officer punished himself with the phrase, "Be Just." He may as well
  have punished himself with the phrase, "Be definitive," for this is
  where he has failed, as Kafka has not. Perhaps Kafka was anxious about
  the danger of art's success, about his own potential to silence--or
  to provide answers.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, if the artist achieves silence in response to her work, is that
good or bad? Is silence a mark of awe and acquiescence or of apathy? An
aspiration to produce silence generates its own contradiction, since
silence is also the artist's worst reward. The officer is one such victim
of his decision to work in the medium of silence and to fall silent in the
presence of beauty. The artistry of the machine has worked on him. It is
beautiful to him, and therefore definitive and also just. He cannot bear
the idea of dismantling the machine. Kafka's exploration of a problem with
art compels a realization that beauty insists on retention. Or rather,
when people decide that something is beautiful, they cannot bear the idea
of its destruction. The beauty of the machine seems to the officer to
answer a raft of questions--about monarchy, about justice, about use--that
have never been asked. The officer's obsession with the beauty of his
machine blocks him from a rigorous ethical analysis of his practices of
punishment. Its beauty, definitive to his eyes, constitutes a distraction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka is famous for defamiliarizing the familiar. One wonders then
whether this problem of beauty's distractions is itself meant, finally,
to look ordinary. Is the apparatus in the penal colony meant to look like
something recognizable in daily life? Is the penal colony meant to look
like an ordinary place? Do problems of beauty and of being definitive in
fact inhabit the everyday realm of punishment that we see all the time
without seeing? I can think of no better illustration of the power of
aesthetic force to distract us from ethical questions than the Chicago
Metropolitan Correctional Center built by Harry Weese in 1975 at 71
W. Van Buren Street. Extraordinarily beautiful, the prison is triangular
and wafer thin, the cream stone almost disappears from some perspectives,
body become nothing in a ritual of reverse transubstantiation. Its windows
are slits. This is what sets it apart from the rest of the sky-reaching,
far-looking buildings of the Chicago Loop. In everything else it conforms
to the aesthetic standards of downtown. It is, at the very least, nice
for people in nearby buildings to look at.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The American Institute of Architects <I>Guide to Chicago</I> offers
a description of the building that includes verbal oddities that are
symptoms of the aesthetic distraction provoked by the building. The
entry includes these remarks:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Above the tenth-floor mechanical room, identifiable by its angled air
intakes, are five-inch-wide windows for the inmates' rooms. The long,
thin windows are meant to symbolize an opening that people could not
pass through. Not caring much about symbolism, some architecturally
disrespectful inmates discovered a way around this design feature and
escaped. Lights now wash the exterior, and bars have been added to the
interiors of cells."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So strong is the artist's belief in the power of art to be definitive that
the building project, as described here, involved a complete confusion
of the work that symbols and bars are supposed to do. But symbols and
aesthetic objects do do a great deal of work; they may not effectively
confine bodies, but they do constrain attention. Their force shows in
their ability to distract spectators from questions of ethics, judgment,
and practice. Definitiveness is a power to distract. The question, then,
that Kafka worries

<B></B>

over in "In the Penal Colony" is: to what extremes can aesthetic
distraction go? Or, how much power is working against our effort to
judge? If silence is his worry, it is also his relief. The aesthetic
object that falls into disregard, or grows stale, grants a furlough to
spectators so that they may judge.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka himself concludes his story with a further silence.

While the voyager was negotiating down below with a ferryman to take him
out to the steamer, the pair of them [the soldier and the condemned man]
came racing down the steps, in silence, for they did not dare to shout
[<I>rasten die zwei die Treppe hinab, schweigend, denn zu schreien
wagten sie nicht</I>]. But by the time they reached the foot of the
steps the voyager was already in the boat and the ferry man was just

the voyager picked up a heavy knotted rope from the deck, threatened
them with it and so held them at bay. ["IPC" 153 ]

This essay has two mottoes, and both are riddles. The point of the
first, from H&ouml;lderlin's drama <I>Empedocles,</I> is quickly felt:
"Nichts ist schmerzlicher . . . denn Leiden zu entr&auml;tseln" (Nothing
is more painful . . . than unriddling suffering).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  The second, by Lionel Trilling, reads: "To comprehend unconditioned
  spirit is not so very hard. . . ." I am thinking of how easy readers
  make it for themselves when they grasp unthinkingly the moment of
  alleged enlightenment in the Old Commandant's penal process. "But,"
  continues Trilling, "there is no knowledge rarer than the understanding
  of spirit as it exists in the inescapable conditions which the actual
  and the trivial make for it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  In writing about allotria and excreta in "In the Penal Colony," I shall
  be writing about certain nonsimple forms of the trivial (allotria) and
  the actual (excreta), two products of human activity whose ontological
  status is by no means evident.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Put the most radically serious quest for justification side by side with
 foolishness and nonsense: put the strongest, most intensely-felt life
 side by side with inattentiveness and giddy play. Allotria troubles
 the consciousness of every reader of "In the Penal Colony." There is
 a good deal of difference between how this story has come down to us,
 as a systematically pure and grave conceptual meditation on the one
 hand; and, on the other, how it actually reads. Then we will be struck
 by the emphasis on such matters as blood and vomit and sputum and muck
 and oil and the disposal system laid out to contain them; and we will
 be struck by the high jinks, horseplay, capers, antics (it turns out

<B></B>

that there are a great many words for this neglected category) imbricated
in this construction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Allotria" means what's irrelevant (<I>das
Nicht-Sachgem&auml;&szlig;e</I>), what's nonsensical
(<I>Unfug)</I>--clowning about, cutting up--exactly what the officer in
"In the Penal Colony" calls "childish nonsense" (<I>den Unsinn eines
Kindes</I>) when he is unable to convince the explorer of the value of
the penal system he represents. I quote:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It did not look as if the officer had been listening. "So you did not
find the procedure convincing," he said to himself and smiled, as an
old man smiles at childish nonsense and yet pursues his own meditations
behind the smile.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not to find the procedure convincing--a serious matter, seriously
argued--is, the officer concludes, senseless resistance. But to note this
is to smile and "pursue [one's] own meditations behind the smile." Perhaps
this is explicit instruction on how we are to read allotria in "In the
Penal Colony," read the several pages in the story dramatizing such
childish nonsense, for we are beset by them, and they are a hermeneutic
puzzle. For example:

The explorer, down below, watched the [officer's] labor uninterruptedly,
his neck grew stiff and his eyes smarted from the glare of sunshine over
the sky. The soldier and the condemned man were now busy together. The
man's shirt and trousers, which were already lying in the pit, were fished
out by the point of the soldier's bayonet. The shirt was abominably dirty,
and its owner washed it in the bucket of water. When he put on the shirt
and trousers both he and the soldier could not help guffawing, for the
garments were of course split up behind. Perhaps the condemned man felt
it incumbent on him to amuse the soldier, he turned around and around
in his slashed garments before the soldier, who squatted on the ground
beating his knees with mirth. All the same, they presently controlled
their mirth out of respect for the gentlemen. ["IPC" 162]

Or, again:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The soldier and the condemned man did not understand at first what was
happening, at first they were not even looking on. The condemned man
was gleeful at having got the handkerchiefs back, but he was not allowed
to enjoy them for long, since the soldier snatched them with a sudden,
unexpected grab. Now the condemned man in turn was trying to twitch them
from under the belt where the soldier had tucked them, but the soldier
was on his guard. So they were wrestling, half in jest. ["IPC" 163]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Childish nonsense," "beating his knees with mirth," "gleeful," "half in
jest," what is the meaning of such things? They occur at a moment of utter
crisis. After all, the officer is about to lay himself on the machine!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One or two things further to this "allotria"--this other Otherness, other
to allegory (<I>allos</I>: Greek for "other" [we shall see that allotria
is other to <I>pedantry</I>]): it has a past. I did not say it's named
as such in Kafka (it <I>is</I> in Thomas Mann's <I>Doctor Faustus</I>:
As a schoolboy, Adrian Leverk&uuml;hn, the serious composer, would not
be suspected of it).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

But the thing is readily enough identified in Kafka's story--as "childish
nonsense"--and the thing itself is found throughout Kafka's work: in
<I>Metamorphosis,</I> for example, it is what Gregor Samsa practices en
route to consolidating his identity as a vermin, playfully taking bits
of food in his mouth and then spitting them out, aimlessly navigating
the junk in his room. Allotria is the compulsory life content of the
vermin--as long as he is not yet being tortured to death. It is also
something that Kafka flashes out of the narrator's relation to his
composition (the semiosis), as when Gregor is shown casting a bewildered
glance upwards to the wall where the photograph hangs of Gregor Samsa,
Army lieutenant, his hand on his short sword, ready to impale his dreadful
Other. Or when Joseph K. stares wonderingly at the tourist who has come
to arrest him in a safari suit replete with pockets, pleats, buttons,
straps--the name of this captor is Franz!
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  And, most famously, now again at the level of the mimesis: the antics
  of the twin assistants in <I>The Castle.</I> It is the sort of thing
  that made Kafka's audiences laugh aloud at his readings, but they did
  not laugh when he read "In the Penal Colony" in Munich in 1916 (a woman
  is said to have fainted). "In the Penal Colony" is no laughing matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   One historical use of the term "allotria" might help to conceptualize
   it. None other than John Wesley writes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We have no right to dispose of anything we have, but according to His
will, seeing we are not proprietors of any of these things; they are all,
as our Lord speaks, <I>allotria, belonging to another person</I>; nor
is anything properly <I>our own,</I> in the land of our pilgrimage. We
shall not receive <I>ta idia, our own things,</I> till we come to our
own country.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This allotria is the nontrivial inauthentic as such, and a good deal more
significant than "time-wasting." It is lent us by God. The Wesley passage
points up the odd dual nature of the thing: it is above and also below
the civilized norm: it is divine and it is improper. More, if it is an
essential quality of Gregor Samsa and all vermin (<I>Ungeziefer</I>) then
it cannot be returned to God, as being (MHG. <I>ungeziber, unziver</I>)
"unsuited for sacrifice," unacceptable to God.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why does Kafka allow, indeed encourage, such displays of attotria? The
answer is overdetermined--at least. For him it is bound to the theater;
one crux is the story as theater. The operation of the torture machine
is <I>ein Spiel</I>--a play. "And then the performance begins" (Und nun
beginnt das Spiel), says the officer [106, "IPC" 147]); later we hear of
the parliamentary assembly, too, as a "Schaustellung," a mise-en-scene or
"public spectacle" (115, "IPC" 158).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  The events of "In the Penal Colony" comprise a theatrical play, with
  the chief spectator in a cane chair in the orchestra, the whole a kind
  of amphitheater, with palisades, as you recall from the outset. And--to
  say this directly--allotria belongs on the principle that, if this is
  a scene, then any amount of stage business is permissible. Indeed, you
  will scarcely find a longer work of Kafka's without its complement of
  stage business. This is the legacy of his highly developed instinct for
  play and performance of the demotic kind: his heroes are almost never
  artists but they are <I>artistes</I>-- trapezists, cabaret singers
  (the mouse Josephine), hunger artists--circus performers, parts of
  the theater of alternative communication: staged,

<B></B>

distantiated, fictional conveyances of feeling, everything opposite to
the immediate conversational discourse which, as Kafka said, drained
the life out of him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the death-dealing machine itself clowns in a parody of the Taylor
speedup system and the circus performance: it collapses as an extravagant
excretion of its gears, as in the circus an endless quantity of persons
are expelled from a small hidden space in a red volkswagen. Here we
verge on a crossing of allotria and excreta, allotria itself being a
sort of excrescence on the normal social essence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  But I delay discussion of this element--waste matter, dejecta--until
  after spelling out a further motive or two for Kafka's vaudeville. His
  vaudevillian practice, in principle admissible, marks his modernity
  as such--an impertinent mixing of genres and levels of communicated
  feeling, medial feeling (we may think of artistes themselves as yet
  odder types of medial communication). The point is that for all its
  impropriety and distastefulness, allotria works <I>distractingly,</I>
  and its plain function is the way it may work as relief from terror. I
  cite a sentence from <I>The Picture of Dorian Grey,</I> which may
  prove Wilde's usefulness to readings of Kafka. Dorian Grey, having
  heard a disturbing idea,

listened, open-eyed and wondering. . . . He watched it [a bee] with that
strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of
high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion
for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies
us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is another motive. In his diary entry of 9 February 1915, Kafka
complained of "In the Penal Colony." He had written the story in the late
fall of 1914 in the course of writing or failing to write <I>The Trial</I>
but had not sought to publish it, in good part because he thought he'd
botched the ending. Further evidence of this assumption is the presence in
the diary entries for August 1917 of a number of sketches of alternative
endings, none of which Kafka used. In the course of this essay, however,
I shall have recourse to refer to several of them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I said he had botched the ending of "In the Penal Colony" and to his
mind he had botched the whole of it too; on 4 September 1917, he wrote
to Kurt Wolff: "Perhaps there is some misunderstanding concerning the
'Penal Colony.' I have never been entirely wholehearted in asking for it
to be published. Two or three of the final pages are botched [<I>sind
Machwerk</I>], and their presence points to some deeper flaw; there is
a worm somewhere which hollows out the story [<I>der selbst das Volle
der Geschichte hohl macht</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we rely on Kafka's evaluation, this worm alludes to a certain "element"
which he saw--it appears--in the story he began writing in February 1915
that he calls the "dog story," which has not survived. (This is not, of
course, the splendid "Investigations of a Dog," written in 1922). This
"dog story," if this is indeed the story that Kafka is thinking of when he
continues his diary entry with the words, "Just now read the beginning,"
is "in spite of all its truth wicked, pedantic, mechanical, a fish barely
breathing on a sand bank [<I>trotz aller Wahrheit b&ouml;se, pedantisch,
mechanisch, auf einer Sandbank ein noch knapp atmender Fisch</I>]"
(11:77).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  "Mechanical," "sand bank," and "fish"

<B></B>

might be clues that he is also or, indeed, directly thinking of "In the
Penal Colony." For the words "mechanical" and "pedantic," we substitute
"allegory" and "abstraction"--this is what the scholar Ingeborg Henel
has done, as representing to excess one tendency of Kafka's art--as
opposed to the liveliness that Kafka saw in abundance in "The Stoker,"
the first chapter of his "American novel" <I>Der Verschollene</I>
(He who was never again heard from).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  It is not hard to guess what Kafka might have meant by pedantry,
  allegory, or abstraction in the case of "In the Penal Colony": it is
  the machine and the law and the scenes of political wrangling conjured
  by the officer, none of which has its foot in lived experience or which
  could be said to arise from "the translation of an idea into an image,
  pure construction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  But we are not obliged to be satisfied with his own judgment; it is much
  too cursory, and it leaves out too much of what in the story is not of
  the order of allegory but rather of allotria. Portions of this work,
  a constellation, dance on the border of conceptual knowledge: mimetic
  allotria, bodily excreta, odd signs; randomly functioning allusions;
  plays on words that have been expelled from the circle of communication
  and made thing-like; and the bag of fragmentary, unincorporated endings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Allotria is a key term, as that being beside the point, that going
off topic, that is unrecoverable as allegory. Itself an insubstantial
irrelevance, allotria both is and is attracted to elements that are
extruded and expunged from healthy, directed life--its excreta. Children
and madmen, who are drawn to excreta, whose play is so much excreta,
cannot but seem foolish--or worse--in the eyes of adults. They are at best
distractions from, at worst obstacles to, the rational conduct of life. So
it will not come as a surprise that Kafka is guilty because "on his own
admission he is depraved and takes pleasure in filth [<I>Schmutz</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  I now come to some excremental oddities in "In The Penal Colony"
  (I use the word "excremental" in its various senses of "superfluous,"
  "non-nutritive," and "of matter to be evacuated"), and am in this
  way looking askance at and away from the story's great themes of
  just sentencing, truthful writing, canonical law, torture, and
  illumination. But we will be making a return.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The excremental speaks for itself--or does it? In this story--and in
the history of its versions--the process of excretion functions as a
species of speech . . . uncannily: it is the body's mute howl of pain,
its resistance to being evacuated of its substance. It is a marker of the
body, of man's embodiedness, of the all-too-tender and recalcitrant flesh
that will not submit to discipline. It expresses itself as a protest. What
is then disgusting about such expressions, such excreta, may be their
half-living character: they are remains of the body even as they leave the
body, neither at first alive nor dead, an unwonted revelation (outside)
of the body (an inside). Hence, they are forbidden objects of curiosity
and an inducement, to the nonsqueamish, to play--allotria.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the second half of this essay, I want to fill in a quadrilateral: the
fact of allotria and excreta at the order of the mimesis; and allotria
and excreta at the order of the semiosis--I mean, the relation of the
author-<I>cum</I>-narrator to the act of composition or scription. There
is allotria in "In the Penal Colony" at the order of the composition,
at the order of the tropes, in Kafka's aberrant literalization of the
metaphor "dog." This is

<B></B>

a rhetorical play, and it connects to serious matters, belongs to an
economy involving the political. Consider the metaphor of the prisoner as
dog. We are, after all, here in the <I>Tropen,</I> the tropics--setting
for a scene of political terror--and we are also among the tropes,
<I>turns</I> of phrase. The apparent allotria of tropic play belongs to
an economy of the political administration of torture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider politics, further. Consider it as the decent (or indecent)
application of power to persons, especially as this power is produced,
stored and conveyed by institutions--viz. the "apparatus" or "machinery"
of the law in "In the Penal Colony" and the apparatus or machinery of
(the very story) "In the Penal Colony." This interinvolvement of the
two sorts of power is plain in the first paragraph, which situates
the apparatus of the torture machine and its spectators in its sandy
amphitheater. The most graphically represented of the spectators and
indeed participants is the prisoner, "a stupid-looking, wide-mouthed
[wide-muzzled (<I>breitm&auml;uliger</I>)] man with bewildered [abandoned
by authority (<I>verwahrlostem</I>)] hair and face"--an animal-like
creature, guarded ["led about" would be truer] by a soldier, "who held the
heavy chain controlling the small chains locked on the prisoner's ankles,
wrists, and neck, chains that were themselves attached to each other by
communicating links" ("IPC" 140). Having been treated like a dog (he has
even been struck on the nose by a whip), it comes as no surprise that he
has become doglike. Kafka depicts this in the striking manner that is at
once typical and still enigmatic, as we shall see. The text continues:
"In any case [additionally (<I>&uuml;brigens</I>)--there is a world of
significance in this harmless conjunctive phrase], the condemned man
looked so like a submissive dog [<I>so h&uuml;ndisch ergeben</I>] that
one might have thought he could be left to run free on the surrounding
hills and would only need to be whistled for when the execution was due
to begin" (ibid.). Doggishly submissive (<I>h&uuml;ndisch ergeben</I>)
is a metaphor. But the intensifier <I>so</I> added on to <I>h&uuml;ndisch
ergeben</I> literalizes that metaphor: the prisoner is now no different
from a dog. There are two interinvolved processes here, one political
and one rhetorical. The man is brutalized by a violent application
of political power; and the metaphor, too, is submitted to a kind of
violence in being robbed of its floating status as trope and more or
less literalized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I say "more or less" literalized, for as becomes evident after a moment's
reflection on this process, every metaphor is an unsettled semantic
force-field. This is a Kafkan awareness par excellence. To tamper with
the relation between tenor and vehicle--thing compared and comparison--is
to generate monsters (even independently of the literal meaning of the
metaphor "dog"); so even more is at stake here than that a man has been
turned into a dog. The aberrant literalizing of the metaphor suggests
that he has been turned into a monstrous collage of dog features and man
features outside of any ordinary scale of things--neither man nor dog,
he is rendered more brutal than a man, more monstrous than a dog.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This literalizing moment was a crucial one for Kafka in the story. He
hated, as I said, the ending of "In the Penal Colony"; and unlike the case
of "The Metamorphosis," whose ending he also hated, he left behind several
fragmentary versions of possible alternatives in his diaries. These are
extraordinarily lurid. One reads:

The explorer felt too tired to give [any further] commands or [indeed]
to do anything. He merely took a handkerchief from his pocket, gestured
as if he were dipping it in the distant bucket, pressed it to his brow
and lay down beside the pit [this emphasizes the excrement-containing
pit and bucket]. He was found in this position by the two men the
Commandant had sent out to fetch him. He jumped up when they spoke
to him as if revived. With his hand on his heart he said, "I am a cur
[<I>Hundsfott</I>] if I allow that to happen." But then he took his own

This diary entry dates from 7 August 1917; he had written "In the
Penal Colony" three years earlier, ca. 15 October 1914. Notice the
administration of political authority and also the mad, foolish play
with rative language (allotria of the signifier). This play returns,
too, to the first paragraph of the story but here, as an unincorporated
fragment, remains excreted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I want to dwell on this relation of the play with rhetoric and the
seriousness of the political administration of terror. In these examples
from the beginning and end of the story, the will and the ability to
tamper with the metaphor goes to the artist, who obtains thereby an
extraordinary rhetorical power not without marginal political power
(since this metaphorical labeling lends itself to political use). This
monstrous literalization is the rhetorical equivalent of the political,
where the political--in this our painful modernity--has come to mean the
construction of types of men and women by the application of force and
the constructive destruction of men and women as persons as good as dead:
vermin, outlaws, rogues.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I do not claim that Kafka <I>says</I> that the political and the
rhetorical are involved in one another, duplicate one another, or cause
one another. Yet he does show this complication happening. Thus I claim,
simply, that it takes place. The word-play that has a great deal to do
with torture-play is not merely marginal to the text and its time. But
the effort to say what this connection is in truth--whether, as Cultural
Studies has it, the political play contains and comprehends the rhetorical
play; or whether the rhetorical play, marginally outside politics, in turn
provokes political acts and a subtle knowing representation of political
acts (J. M. Coetzee writes of "the freedom of textuality, however meager
and marginal that freedom may be")--Kafka's story cannot <I>say</I> this.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Addressing this rhetorical dimension of the story entails addressing
one sort of play, one form of the marginal, that has the power to usurp
center stage. We must now look at the disgusting, and then at three
textual cruxes triggered once more by rhetorical details. All bear on
the process of <I>reading</I> a work interrupted by allotria and excreta.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"'Read it,' said the officer. 'I can't,' said the explorer" ("IPC"
148). There is no information on how the victim's reading process is to
take place; it requires a strenuous and ultimately frustrating effort
of interpretation on our part. The writing is of two

<B></B>

types--the first is called "the actual [real] script(ure) [<I>die
wirkliche Schrift</I>]" and "the [authentic] script(ure) itself
[<I>die eigentliche Schrift</I>]"; the second type of writing is
ornamental, consisting of "embellishments [<I>Verzierungen</I>]" (107;
"IPC" 149). One might be inclined to call the second type inauthentic,
secondary, derivative, employing the semiotic model of the metaphor. The
real, authentic meaning is borne along, as the tenor, by the trope--the
metaphor as such--which then might pass away, its semantic work as vehicle
having been done. But this cannot be right; this is not the function
of the embellishment, since reading the ornament is <I>essential</I> to
the work of justice, to "the kind of sentence we pass [the form of our
judgment--<I>die Form unseres Urteils</I>]" (103, "IPC" 144). The form
is not complete, the essence of the punishment does not happen until the
ornament, too, has been deciphered. Nor is there any suggestion that the
embellishments, rightly deciphered, amount to getting the message--the
sentence as violated commandment is different from its embellishments--but
not essentially different.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  In the <I>Tropen,</I> in the tropics, all are tropes (<I>Tropen</I>):
  the designation of the real, the authentic sentence, is already gnawed
  on by this secondary and derivative function; and so we are inclined
  to ask, Of what are they the res, the fictive (after all not real
  or authentic) script? But we are unable to say more than that they are
  essential. This is artistic (<I>kunstvoll</I>), beautiful but nonsimply
  beautiful handwriting, "no calligraphy [<I>keine Sch&ouml;nschrift</I>]
  for schoolchildren" (107, "IPC" 149). He clearly signifies something
  within what the officer calls "<I>das Gesamturteil</I> [the general
  or broad-gauged judgment]" (109, "IPC" 151), but what?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   Perhaps it signifies, in the sense of mirroring--or completing a
   structural parallel with--the function of the ostensibly trivial
   (allotria) and excremental in the story as such--the curlicues
   and embellishments being equivalent to the plethora of "useless"
   details. They are marginal and excremental, suspending any possible
   assertion of the precedence, as essential, of issues of justice over
   the other issues of art and aesthetics. Here we are returned to the
   historical dispute among modes of criticism and modes of literary
   classification, within Kafka studies, in respect to "In the Penal
   Colony." Is it, as a story of a punishment that raises substantial
   questions of law and justice and just sentencing, to be classified with
   those other stories of Kafka (as Kafka explicitly intended), with "The
   Metamorphosis" and "The Judgment"; or should it be classified with,
   par excellence, "A Hunger Artist," as a story of art and performance
   for which no audience any longer exists?
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  "Nor did the colony itself betray much interest in this execution": this
  citation immediately resonates with the opening of "A Hunger Artist"
  (100, "IPC" 140). But these are structural formalities. The matter of
  the embellishment poses the crucial question: if the epistemological
  status, as we say, of the ornamental script(ure) is undecidable, if the
  relation of trope to diegesis is unfathomable, what then is the status
  of the understanding that is given to the prisoner's faculty of reason
  (<I>der Verstand</I>) in the sixth hour?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This question has hardly ever seemed to be stated as a problem before. In
the sixth hour the culprit grasps his sentence--so runs the conventional
understanding--but does he? Surely not. First, because the process
requires a <I>twelve-hour</I> deciphering; second, because what Kafka
(unlike his English translator) has written is, the process

<B></B>

requires a twelve-hour "<I>deciphering</I> [<I>Entziffern</I>]"
. This phrase immediately calls attention to the signifier
(<I>Ziffer</I>), but you would not think so, reading the Muirs's
translation of "<I>es geschieht ja nichts weiter, der Mann f&auml;ngt
blo&szlig; an, die Schrift zu entziffern</I>" as, "Nothing more happens
than that the man begins to understand the inscription [the script(ure)]"
("IPC" 150). What is wrong is a tendency that this translation betrays;
this "to understand" recalls the rational enlightenment provoked in the
sixth hour, when enlightenment comes to the most dull-witted (<I>Verstand
geht dem Bl&ouml;desten auf</I>), encouraging us to conclude that the
event of understanding coming alive is equivalent to the truth of an
ethical commandment being grasped by reason (ibid.). And that truth
is? Whatever it is, it is <I>not</I> the truth of the verdict. One
<I>must</I> consult the German! <I>The moment of ecstasy is not that of
understanding the script(ure); it is a moment of recognizing that here
there is script to be deciphered.</I> "Script(ure) [<I>Die Schrift</I>],"
as the Prison Chaplain in <I>The Trial</I> informs Joseph K., this writing
made deep, "is unchanging, invariant [<I>ist unver&auml;nderlich</I>]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  We deal then not with combustion of the script (&agrave; la Walter
  Benjamin) but with the ineradicability of a fact: here there is writing;
  here is the task of the translator. But if the prisoner deciphers the
  script with his wounds, and if at the end of things the prisoner is
  (virtually) nothing more than his wounds, then perfection of justice
  consists in the wounds deciphering the wounds or, equivalently,
  the script deciphering the script, leaving no margin free for
  rational enlightenment or any other manner of interpretation. "How
  the inscription takes form on the body [<I>wie sich die Inschrift im
  K&ouml;rper vollzieht</I>]" is by no means equivalent to the "happening
  of justice" (<I>da&szlig; Gerechtigkeit</I> [<I>geschieht</I>])," if
  by the latter is meant the prisoner's understanding of his sentence
  (106, 111). He cannot understand his sentence until he is emptied out
  of his substance, until he has been <I>excreted.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this analysis I am associating the concepts of understanding and
interpretation as they have traditionally been associated in a German
hermeneutical tradition marked especially by Friedrich Schlegel and
Friedrich Schleiermacher. The concept of "decoding," however, with its
connotations of automaticity and of transformation only, or chiefly,
along the axis of the material signifier constitutes a departure. Here,
one could well think of Kafka's aphorism against interpretation, written
in 1922: "It is enough that the arrows fit exactly in the wounds that
they have made" (<I>D</I> 206; <I>G</I> 11:203).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We as readers of Kafka remain concerned with our access to an
understanding of what genuinely, authentically, occurs within the
<I>Gesamturteil</I> of the story as a whole. It is the question of
whether it is possible for us to achieve any proper understanding of the
prisoner's tormented reading process as such. And here I want to call
attention to two minor, marginal, rather excremental cruxes at the order
of scription--one parenthesis and one (following the authority of Max
Brod) crossing-out. Excreted matter has an exact semiotic correlative
in the parenthesis: it is excluded from the sentence while it still
belongs to the economy of the sentence the way that excreta--noticed,
half-organic, half-alive stuff--belongs to the economy of the
body. The parenthesis is unique as a syntactical element in requiring
no corresponding adjustment in the sentence as a whole in order to
accommodate it, just as there is a provision in every body for excreted
matter that does not disturb the economy of the whole and permits it to
function as it normally and otherwise functions.

<B></B>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The parenthesis occurs at the close of the mutilation of the officer. The
passage reads, as we carry over Kafka's <I>parenthesis</I> from the
edition (and only the edition) of Paul Raabe: "And here, almost against
his will, he had to look at the face of the corpse. It was as it had
been in life; no sign was visible of the promised redemption; what the
others had found in the machine the officer had not found; the lips were
firmly pressed together, the eyes were open, with the same expression
as in life, the look was calm and convinced, through the forehead went
the point of the great iron spike." [121, "IPC" 166] Thereafter come
the three asterisks and the unsatisfactory ending.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Who says--and on what authority--that the officer found no trace of
the promised redemption? The officer remains convinced; he has not
registered the shortfall in the promised redemption. But he is the
only authority we have for the existence of any such redemption. I
suggest that the uncertainty of the claim that "no sign was visible
of the promised redemption" in the death of the officer is marked,
emphasized by the parenthesis. Within it is contained the (incomplete)
excremental at the order of rhetoric. This is an odd detail of a sort
found to my knowledge in no other work of Kafka--a "detail" of utter
importance. It is a paradoxical construction, implying, to begin with, a
sort of tentativeness of utterance. For what is the meaning of the marker
"parenthesis" except that of an addition, an "<I>&uuml;brigens,</I>"
a remainder, an only secondary reflection, whose retention in the body
of an argument is a matter that cannot be allowed to disturb the writer,
who has more serious, forward-looking concerns? The argument, as it is
constituted without the parenthesis, takes precedence: the writer will
not undertake to integrate the parenthetical matter; and yet, in this
instance, regarding the question of whether the officer found meaning
in his ordeal--No, not a trace of it was to be found!--is of crucial
importance. It is the story's leading idea. How can one find the story's
leading idea between parentheses?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is as if what's contained in the parenthesis, a bracketing off--meaning
non-pertinence, what's off the point, scarcely belonging--were itself
provisory only, subject to revision, even to reversal. And yet--or,
precisely--what is here at stake is nothing less than the meaning of
the whole. Was there ever in truth such a procedure as the glorious
operation of the machine? was there ever so worthy an alternative to the
inefficient justice of liberal states? could a death ever be justified
in the consciousness of the victim in this way? could the truth of one's
derelict life ever be inscribed on the heart?
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  And could, incidentally, Nietzsche's account of the genealogy of morals
  be affirmed--was there ever a moment of dawning moral enlightenment
  powerful enough to irradiate and transre an entire people? Sane
  societies require a token of hope, the promise of a future. Accordingly,
  the punishment in the penal colony is such a token, because it promises
  a transration of an entire community before death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These are some of the questions taken up in a parenthesis in "In the Penal
Colony" as published--overwhelming questions to which Kafka's answers are
belied by his parenthesis--questions reviewed and answered differently
in the three or four fragmentary endings. I shall therefore address one
more pertinent item from these diary manuscripts in the event of a moot
crossing-out. The text of these endings in the latest Fischer, so-called
manuscript edition, a printed transcription by and large faithful to

<B></B>

the manuscripts, gives as the diary entry for 8 August 1917: "Und
wenn auch alles unver&auml;ndert war, der Stachel war doch da, krumm
hervorragend aus der geborstenen Stirn" (<I>G</I> 11:353). In (my)
English, this reads: "And even if everything was unchanged, the spike was
still there, protruding crookedly from his shattered forehead." But if you
read the standard English translation of the diaries, you get instead:
"And even if everything remained unchanged, the spike was still there,
crookedly protruding from his shattered forehead <I>as if it bore witness
to some truth</I>" (<I>D</I> 178; emphasis added). The addition of this
last phrase is explained in a footnote of Max Brod, Kafka's editor
and literary executor: "The clause, 'as if it bore witness to some
truth,' was struck out by Kafka in the manuscript" (<I>D</I> 322). So
this footnotation "as if it bore witness to some truth," having, then,
precisely parenthetical status, returns to a <I>crossing out</I> (leaving
in the empirical state of affairs of the transmission of the manuscript
the perplexing uncertainty about whether Kafka's intention in having
crossed out the phrase "as if [his shattered forehead] bore witness to
some truth" is to be respected). If respected, the sum of things is left
intact and pure and <I>no</I> trace of the promised redemption was indeed
to be seen. But it is equally compelling to preserve this velleity (it is
<I>not</I> preserved in the manuscript edition)--to find in the officer's
report the positive substance of justice--for it would convey a most
important indecision and nostalgia and intense imaginative yearning in
Kafka, he who had written (while still young) of his desire to write his
being into the depths of the paper and to draw up that writing into him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The words "as if it bore witness to some truth" are remarkable ones to
cross out. Kafka's own reading confirms the reader's suspicions. This
is not a story about true sentencing but about its disappearance,
its traceable disappearance in the intricacies and hollow places of
fiction. Throughout, the narration of (principally) the reception--on
the part of the Explorer--of the narration produced by a fanatic of
a ceremony who can no more than imply that a prisoner's (attempt at)
deciphering the truth of his sentence is achieved with his death. The
truth of this procedure is then nullified when it is empirically enacted
by the same fanatic on himself. But what we have lost as an "acquist
of true experience," we have gained as a tolerable experience of the
trivial of allotria and the excremental.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  What is tasteless in the actual and trivial is etiolated, bled of its
  loathsome horror, by this multiplication of narrative foci and foyers--a
  gesture which, by driving truth out of art, enlarges its scope. In
  this work the tastelessness of trifling allotria and the excremental
  (a kind of expressiveness) are symbols together of the distasteful that
  now has a place in art and can be borne. Its "meaning" is reflexive
  only. It points to the vast, unlimited--because truth-bled--order of
  the signifier in art. This is a conclusion perfectly consistent with
  Hegel's view of the end of art as the end of an art that would need
  to be validated by the truth it can now no longer represent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to a great Rabbi, Walter Benjamin recalls in his essay on Kafka,
the coming Messiah "will not wish to change the world by force but will
merely make a slight adjustment in it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  A slight adjustment of the ordinary--this is indeed what happens
  everywhere in Kafka's texts in which daily objects, made all but
  invisible through familiarity, are transformed into enigmatic
  signs. The archetype of the enigmatic object-sign for Kafka is the
  door, and it is indeed doors that structure the parabolic and mythic
  space of his narratives. Opened and shut, locked and unlocked, peeped
  through and barricaded, they cease to be ordinary doors and become
  instead architectural elements in a theater of the unsayable. This
  is of course nowhere more true than with those doors that his heroes
  regularly confront in their search for truth: it happens to K. in <I>The
  Castle,</I> to Josef K. in <I>The Trial,</I> and, most famously of
  all, to the man from the country in the parable "Before the Law." If
  only they were able to pass through these enigmatic doors and come
  face to face with what lies behind them, these texts seem to suggest,
  they would finally be able to grasp the truth they have been seeking,
  discover the Law of their lives. Kafka's doors, in other words, hold
  out the promise of revelation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" is a remarkably doorless story. Instead
of the crowded attics of <I>The Trial</I> or the tenebrous landscape of
<I>The Castle,</I> "In the Penal Colony" takes place in a barren desert
valley, under a glare so intense as to prompt the explorer to shelter
"his eyes from the sun with one hand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  It is more than sunlight, however, against which the explorer seeks
  protection. "With the strongest light," Kafka writes in an aphorism,

<B></B>

"one can dissolve the world. Before weak eyes, it gains in solidity,
before weaker ones it develops fists, before even weaker ones it becomes
bashful and crushes him who dares to look at it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The light of "In the Penal Colony" is precisely of this nature, yet
  it dissolves not the world but the image of revelation. Kafka's story
  takes us to the other side of the door. The irony of this move is that
  it erases the very topography on which the enigma of the door rests,
  the locus of the "beyond." For beyond the door lies not the territory
  of meaning but an institution that produces the illusion of a door that
  simultaneously defines and blocks access to this territory. "In the
  Penal Colony" is Kafka's attempt to traverse the fantasy of revelation
  by unveiling the mechanical nature of its production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage through the door of revelation takes the form of an epic
journey red as an ethnographic travelogue. The subject of this journey
is a European explorer--a representative of Reason and Enlightenment--sent
from the mainland of the Empire to a remote island penal colony. This
spatial displacement is also a journey back in time. First, because the
passage from center to periphery is red as a passage from civilization
to a more primitive society; and second, because the colony itself
comprises two disparate temporalities.  The colony's present, embodied
in the reign of the New Commandant, and its mythic past, associated
with the rule of the Old Commandant, the inventor of the machine. The
machine, then, is placed at a double remove, distanced from the center
of the Empire by a topographical and a temporal frame. To this must be
added a third frame, an explicitly narrative one: the description of the
glorious working of the machine is given in an embedded narrative through
the words of the officer, who was the Old Commandant's assistant in all
penal matters, and who seeks to persuade the explorer to join him in his
t against the New Commandant ("IPC" 198). The effect of this triple
framing is to bracket the machine's historical character and foreground
its fantasmatic nature. The operations of the machine, if not the machine
itself, in other words, are part of an institutional fantasy. But whose
fantasy is it? Most clearly the officer's, whose fixation on the Old
Commandant reveals a resistance to the passing of time as such: that is,
to history. From the perspective of his mythical world view, the machine
embodies the very idea of justice. As for the explorer, to the extent
that he stands outside this mythical framework, he is also unaffected by
the officer's institutional fantasy. And in a way, this is indeed the
case. The explorer approaches the machine in the manner of a critical
historian, judging it, not as an idealized form of justice, but as a
brutal and outdated instrument of power. But this historical perspective
is itself fantasmatic in that it provides the explorer, under the cover of
seemingly impartial observation, with the archaic foil for his <I>own</I>
institutional fantasy of a modern, civilized, European legal system
which has outgrown the brute violence of its archaic prehistory. Another
way of putting this is to say that the fantasy of the explorer is the
Enlightenment fantasy of an historical-scientific stance <I>outside</I>
any fantasmatic frame, the stance of theoretical objectivity. Kafka's
narrative throws into doubt precisely this presumed impartiality, along
with the strict opposition between archaic and Enlightenment justice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the center of both fantasies stands a common conception of law and
justice. According to it, justice depends on two fundamental conditions:
first, the symmetry

<B></B>

between crime and punishment; and second, the veridical subsumption
of the particular case under the universal law. But while within
the Enlightenment model these conditions--that is, of symmetry and of
veridical subsumption--are regulative ideas that orient the legal system
but can never be fully satisfied, the Old Commandant designed a machine
that transforms these ideas into physical principles. The judiciary
system of the penal settlement radicalizes the Enlightenment conception
of justice to the point of crisis. Pushed to its extreme, the symmetry
between crime and punishment gives way to identity, and the subsumption
of the particular under the universal gives way to a sacrificial logic
reducing the individual to a corporeal instantiation of the universal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The operations of the machine induce a semantic collapse in which
the meaning of the elements proper to the conception of justice
are obliterated. Consider the officer's articulation of the a priori
character of guilt. "My guiding principle is this," he declares, "Guilt
is never to be doubted. Other courts cannot follow that principle , for
they consist of several opinions and have higher courts to scrutinize
them. This is not the case here. . . " ("IPC" 198). The officer's
principle obscures the semantic difference between <I>Anschuldigung</I>
(accusation) and <I>Schuld</I> (guilt): to be <I>angeschuldigt</I> is to
be <I>schuldig,</I> to be accused is to be guilty. Consequently, there is
no longer any need to prove the connection between crime and criminal. The
penal colony's judiciary system does away with all procedures and language
games--interrogation, litigation, deliberation, etc.--that characterize
the trial as a process of truth-finding. In fact, the system undoes
the temporal character of legal procedure, and in so doing erases the
nature of the sentence as a logical judgment reached through a process
of reasoning. Instead of the gradual subsumption of the particular under
the general, we are confronted with the instantaneous identification of
the accused individual and the Law. A similar semantic collapse affects
the notion of symmetry between crime and punishment, which is pushed
to the point where the difference between the two collapses. "Our
sentence does not sound severe. Whatever commandment the prisoner
has disobeyed is written upon his body by the Harrow. 'This prisoner,
for instance,'--the officer indicated the man--'will have written on
his body: HONOR THY SUPERIORS!'" ("IPC" 197). Where transgression and
punishment stand in such exact and predetermined relation to each other,
no human weighing need balance the scales of crime and punishment,
and no subjective judgment interferes with the working of justice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From this series of erasures and fusions emerges a Law devoid of any
specific meaning. The machine embodies the fantasy of a symbolism
without semantic mediation, of a supreme and transcendent language so
pure as to be untranslatable into ordinary words. I want to approach
the inner logic of this fantasy by way of a short detour through the
work of another writer who, one hundred years before Kafka, had dreamed
up a similar machine. In his short essay, "On the Marionette Theater,"
Heinrich von Kleist, one of Kafka's favorite authors, puts forth the
rather surprising proposition that the most graceful movement can be
achieved, not by a professional dancer, but by a marionette.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  This is so, the character named C. explains, because in human movement
  there is an unavoidable split between the soul, as the principle of
  motion, and

<B></B>

the body, as its organ. This split is brought about through human desire,
which directs the soul toward an external object, thus displacing the
body's point of gravity in a way that necessarily fractures the harmony
of the body and soul and disrupts the gracefulness of movement. The
marionette, on the other hand, due to its complete absence of desire and
intentionality, knows no such internal fracture. Guided by a machinist
or, in the most advanced form, by a machine that operates according
to a set of mathematical rules, the marionette's dance is therefore
capable of realizing a perfectly formalized--and in this sense, absolutely
beautiful--movement. The dance of the marionette is the fullest expression
of grace, the complete fusion, without remainder, of matter and form. But
it is also the terrifying image of a pure motion of the soul without soul,
and of a pure expression of the body without body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Where Kleist's marionette-machine seeks the achievement of motion, Kafka's
law-machine seeks the achievement of pure meaning. It is no accident
that, in their drive towards realization, both systems of formalization
encounter the same locus of resistance: the human organism, the life of
the body. In Kleist, this threat to the body surfaces most clearly in
a short anecdote concerning a mutilated Englishman who, after receiving
an artificial leg, was able to achieve a gracefulness of movement vastly
superior to his natural-legged countrymen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  As for Kafka, the machine is nothing other than a complex apparatus
  for the mechanical application of the sacred Law to the body of the
  accused. The machine does not merely apply the Law to, or inscribe it,
  <I>onto</I> the body.  Rather, it passes the Law <I>through</I> the
  body by means of registering its letters directly on the prisoner's
  nervous system. For justice to be revealed, the Law must be deciphered
  through the pain of a body subjected to mechanical torture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
     How exactly does this work? The machine consists of three parts:
     the Designer, which contains the piece of paper with the sentence,
     written according to the elaborately ornamental design of the Old
     Commandant; the Harrow, which engraves "the sentence on the skin of
     the guilty"; and the Bed, covered with cotton-wool, to which the
     accused is strapped and which turns slowly to expose his entire
     body to the writing needles.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Can you follow it? The Harrow is beginning to write; when it finishes the
first draft of the inscription on the man's back, the layer of cotton wool
begins to roll and slowly turns the body over, to give the Harrow fresh
space for writing. Meanwhile the raw part that has been written on lies
on the cotton wool, which is specially prepared to staunch the bleeding
and so makes all ready for a new deepening of the script. Then these
teeth at the edge of the Harrow, as the body turns further round, tear
the cotton wool away from the wounds, throw it into the pit, and there
is more work for the Harrow. So it keeps on writing deeper and deeper
for the whole twelve hours. The first six hours the condemned man stays
alive almost as before, he suffers only pain. After two hours, the felt
gag is taken away, for he has no longer strength to scream. . . . But how
quiet he grows at just about the sixth hour! Enlightenment comes to the
most dull-witted. It begins around the eyes. From there it radiates. A
moment that might tempt one to get under the Harrow oneself. Nothing
more happens than that the man begins to understand the inscription,
he purses his mouth as if he were listening. You have seen how difficult
it is to decipher the script with one's eyes; but our man deciphers it
with his wounds. To be sure, that is a hard task; he

<B></B>

needs six hours to accomplish it. By that time the harrow has pierced him
quite through and casts him into the pit, where he pitches down upon the
blood and water and the cotton wool. Then the judgment has been fulfilled,
and we, the soldier and I, bury him. ["IPC" 203-4]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To approach the logic of this passage, recall Althusser's classic essay
on interpellation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The essay stages a little scene in which a man on a street, anonymously
  hailed by a police officer, responds to this official call by
  turning around. By responding to the officer's "Hey, you there,"
  Althusser suggests, the man recognizes himself as the addressee of
  an institutional call: that is, he identifies his own being in terms
  defined by the authorities. Kafka's story describes a mechanism that is
  at once very similar and very different. As with Althusser, it stages a
  scene of ideological recognition: the moment of transration is the
  one when the prisoner deciphers, and recognizes himself in, the Law
  that is being inscribed onto his body. But whereas in Althusser the
  drama of interpellation takes place on the level of the psyche, this
  process now works directly on and through the body. Interpellation, in
  Kafka, occurs through the somatization of ideology; it is a mechanical
  operation through which the Symbolic is carved into the subject's body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is also why what in Althusser's allegorical narrative is a moment
of instantaneous capture, in Kafka's story is a process that takes
its time. For the Commandment is not just registered on the body, but
<I>against</I> the body. Recall again the officer's description:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Harrow is beginning to write; when it finishes the first draft of
the inscription on the back, the layer of cotton-wool begins to roll
and slowly turns the body over, to give the Harrow fresh space for
writing. Meanwhile the raw part that has been written only lies on the
cotton-wool, which is especially prepared to staunch the bleeding and
so makes all ready for a new deepening of the script. ["IPC" 203]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A deepening of the script. The Law is inscribed through a process
of repetitive writing that hollows out the body and evacuates its
corporeality. The writing of the Law is therefore not, as the officer
believes--and wants others to believe--a miraculous fusion of body
and meaning. Rather, it is a mechanical operation for extracting the
body's vital energies. Thus the radiating image of comprehension on
the prisoner's face is the product of a terrifying exchange; it is the
chiastic transfer of a meaning whose vitality is brought about through
the extraction of life from the body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The point of intersection between the Symbolic and the somatic, Law and
body, is the prisoner's pain. Pain is, according to a long philosophical
tradition, the locus of private particularity, the one thing that resists,
according to Wittgenstein, verbalization and symbolization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Initially, this is also the case in Kafka. The prisoner's pain marks the
  body's resistance to its material interpellation. But the operations
  of the machine slowly turn this locus of incommunicability into the
  site of revelation. For the prisoner learns his judgment through his
  wounds--that is, he deciphers the commandment not by means of a mental
  reading, but through its encryption onto the nervous

<B></B>

system. This is the core of the institutional fantasy: a machine that
short-circuits semantic mediation and directly inscribes the Symbolic
into the Real of bare life. Ironically, it is precisely through this
bypassing of meaning that the machine transforms the prisoner's body
into the revelatory site of the master signifier, the pure meaning of
Justice. The officer explains that, once the execution began,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
No discordant noise spoilt the working of the machine. Many did not
care to watch it but lay with closed eyes in the sand; they all knew:
Now Justice is being done. . . . Well, and then came the sixth hour! It
was impossible to grant all the requests to be allowed to watch it from
near by. . . . How we all absorbed the look of transration on the
face of the sufferer, how we bathed our cheeks in the radiance of that
justice, achieved at last and fading so quickly! ["IPC" 209]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me pass over the theological subtext of this passage and focus
instead on the fantasmatic and imaginary quality of the scene.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  The passage stages a public spectacle of justice centered on a
  transcendent signifier. The prisoner's tortured body becomes a public
  locus for the formation of the community's collective body. This
  collectivizing force radiates from the prisoner's "transred"
  face, which is held to bear the mark of a master signifier--the
  signifier of justice--whose meaning, due to its other-worldly origin,
  cannot be uttered in ordinary language but must be revealed through
  its embodiment. The scene of torture, then, is staged as one of
  revelation, as the disclosure of divine Law. But note that this
  revelation does not result from the prisoner's deciphering of his
  wounds, however, but from the spectator's deciphering of the prisoner's
  facial expressions. In other words, transration occurs not through
  the metamorphosis of the body but by means of an interpretation that
  reads bodily changes in terms of transration. Indeed, so strong is
  the belief of the spectators in this transration of the body that
  "[m]any did not care to watch it but lay with closed eyes in the sand;
  they all knew: Now Justice is being done!" All of this underscores my
  claim, I believe, that the machine is part of a carefully orchestrated
  institutional fantasy of encryption and decipherment, it is, in a word,
  a cryptograph. The meaning of justice is not, as the fantasy wants
  us to believe, instantiated in a transred body; rather, it is the
  product of a mechanical ritual that stages the sacrifice of the body
  as a scene of transration. The fantasy of revelation emerges, in
  short, through the double determination of the private and inaccessible
  terrain of human pain on the one hand, and its decipherment in the
  spectacle of public reception on the other. Revelation, in short, is
  shown to be the removal of a veil that it itself has created. It is not
  a self-identical truth but a two-sided form, not a transcendent meaning
  located beyond a door but a complex spectacle that first produces the
  sense of an inaccessible beyond (the private terrain of pain) in order
  then to stage its public disclosure (the moment of decipherment).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So much, then, for the institutional fantasy of the Old Commandant. But
what about the claim that this fantasy is not restricted to the old order,
but is relevant as well to our understanding of both the penal colony and
the Empire. To argue this point, I shall, as it were, briefly traverse
Kafka's triple framing of the machine in reverse order,

<B></B>

arguing first that the operations of the machine epitomize the
workings of penal colonies as such; and second that the penal colony
is the spatial actualization of a topological dimension immanent to
Enlightenment law. As for the first move--from machine to colony--the
oppositions between Symbolic and somatic, Law and body, structuring
the working of the machine are repeated, at the level of the colony, in
the opposition between oppressor and oppressed. Moreover, this analogy
holds for the specific dynamic that links these terms. For what, after
all, is the disciplinary purpose of a penal colony if not to inscribe
into the oppressed, through a series of disciplinary operations, the
<I>character</I> of empire? Seen in these terms, the colony too is a kind
of semiotic machine akin to the cryptograph, and the reforms of the New
Commandant will at best change the specific technologies of encryption,
but not the fact of encryption as such.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for my second claim--the structural connection between colony and
empire--the case is more complex and requires a small detour. I want
to suggest that the relation between colony and empire is equivalent
to the relation between the ordinary course of events and the state
of exception. Kierkegaard, whom Kafka admired, once wrote, "the
exception explains the universal and himself, and if one really wants
to study the universal, one only needs to look around for a legitimate
exception. . . . The exception . . . thinks the universal with intense
passion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Recently, Giorgio Agamben, building on the work of Walter Benjamin and
  Carl Schmitt, has pursued this line of thought and developed a theory
  of power and law predicated on the notion of exception.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Every legal order, Agamben claims, is sustained by an element of
  extralegal violence. This violence brings order into existence in the
  first place, but persists throughout the law's normal operations, and
  is visible in the apparatus of law-enforcing institutions, like that of
  the police, without which no legal order can function. The topological
  structure of this extralegal violence--at once inside and outside the
  law--finds its purest embodiment in the re of the sovereign, who
  has the power, in moments of exceptional danger, legally to suspend
  the law in order to preserve the State and its Law. In such moments,
  the sovereign's word <I>is</I> Law: that is, it carries direct legal
  authority without the mediation of legal process. Borrowing a phrase
  from Gershom Scholem (which incidentally was coined to describe the
  nature of revelation in Kafka) Agamben says that the sovereign's words
  have the character of "being in force without significance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Being in force without significance.  Does this not describe exactly
 the structure of the Law in Kafka's machine, a Law that is devoid of
 meaning and semantic depth, and whose terrifying force is unhampered
 by legal mediation? And is not the Old Commandant, whose word is
 Law and whose rule is absolute, the re par excellence of the
 sovereign? The colony over which he exercised sovereignty, then,
 is the spatial actualization of a topological dimension immanent
 to Law. It is the territory of the exception, a space in which the
 extralegal--and hence meaningless--violence of the Law is rendered both
 visible and material. And to the extent that the cryptograph is the
 purest manifestation of this violence, the narrative passage through the
 triple frame--from empire to colony to machine--is an infernal descent
 from the apparition of Enlightenment reason to the reified force of a
 senseless legality.

"In the Penal Colony" seems to be unique among Kafka's texts in that it
makes use of a concept of redemption that draws on both Jewish <I>and</I>
Christian imagery. The story's emphasis on the <I>public</I> character
of redemption is a defining feature of Messianic thought. According
to Gershom Scholem, "Judaism, in all of its forms and manifestations,
has always maintained a concept of redemption as an event which takes
place publicly, on the stage of history and within the community. It is
an occurrence which takes place in the visible world and which cannot
be conceived apart from such a visible appearance" (<I>The Messianic
Idea in Judaism,</I> trans. Michael Meyer [New York: Schocken Books,
1972], 1). An even stronger Messianic language is sounded at the end of
the story, in the proclamation engraved on the Old Commandant's tomb:
"Here rests the Old Commandant. His adherents, who must now be nameless,
have dug his grave and set up his stone. There is a prophecy that after
a certain number of years the Commandant will rise again and lead his
adherents from his house to recover the colony. Have faith and wait"
("IPC" 226). These Messianic references, however, are intermingled with
Christological motifs. Not only does the machine's method of torture--the
piercing of the body with needles--recall the crucifixion of Christ,
but the importance of the sixth hour as the decisive turning point
is also borrowed directly from Luke's description of Christ's passion
(Luke 23:44). Indeed, the very notion of Justice the story puts forth
seems to blend Jewish and Christological elements. On the one hand, the
fact that the commandment is <I>written</I> onto the body is in keeping
with Jewish thought, which stresses the necessary link between God's
justice and its materialization in scripture. Yet on the other hand,
the fact that justice is revealed through the transration of the
sufferer's <I>face</I> strongly recalls a Christian conception, which
breaks with the Judaic link between justice and scripture by claiming,
according to Paul, that Christ's tortured body directly manifests "the
justice of God <I>without</I> the Law" (Rom. 3:21).

Ideologies that have been superseded by more enduring political discourses
and literary res who have been succeeded by  greater authors are
frequently relegated to the footnotes of cultural scholarship. But
sometimes these lesser-known subjects of literary history, properly
attended to, provide unique opportunities for a richer understanding of
aesthetic developments. The study of British modernism, in particular,
can benefit from a willingness to examine forgotten political-cultural
relationships. Indeed, the period's extreme ideological complexity and
cross-fertilization has served to mask the important political roles
played by less celebrated artists in the formulation of modernist
aesthetic doctrine. This is particularly true of Katherine Mansfield.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most studies either neglect to include Mansfield in their accounts of
modernism's emergence, or else try to correct this oversight by addressing
her influence on Virginia Woolf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  She is largely thought of as someone who was "unaffected by contemporary
  literary trends and divorced from the great social, political and
  cultural events of her time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Even those who contend that she participated in the development of a
  "female modernism" that gave literary voice to "an emerging feminist
  consciousness," as well as those who acknowledge that her stories
  explore "the theme of the exploitation of women," claim that Mansfield
  failed to do so in a perceptibly ideological manner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest collected short stories, those published in the
years 1910-11, have been particularly ill-served by prevailing
views of her indifference to political and social controversy. These
are frequently dismissed as aesthetically unaccomplished and politically
na&iuml;ve. By 1920, Mansfield herself regarded them

<B></B>

as "immature," "juvenile," and "a lie."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  Scholars have generally drawn upon these comments to argue that the
  stories simply mirror popular fears of German invasion or offer an
  unbalanced reflection upon her lonely confinement at a German spa in
  1909, where she gave birth to a stillborn child.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Antony Alpers suggests that the stories, most of which were later
  republished in the volume <I>In a German Pension</I> , were
  influenced by the 1909 box office sensation <I>An Englishman's Home,</I>
  a "clumsy melodrama" that "gave crude expression to the warnings by
  General Roberts of German readiness for war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Patricia Moran argues that the stories are lamentable instances
  of feminine "revulsion and self-loathing" for "the female body's
  materiality," that they "demonstrate how deeply devaluations of women
  cripple and deform women's estimation of themselves, even when women
  consciously resist and revise those demeaning cultural scripts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite their lowly critical status, however, these works have a great
deal to teach us about Mansfield's politically engaged role in the
development of early British modernism. Originally published in the
British socialist magazine <I>The New Age,</I> these stories--viewed
in proper historical context--reveal that she contributed to one of the
least acknowledged, but nevertheless most important, shifts in political
outlook and literary taste of her time. Though not as fully achieved (or
even as modernist) as her later fiction, their occasional stridency and
callowness only serve to emphasize their transitional literary-historical
nature. Through their criticisms of German imperial culture and maternity
and formal rejection of plot and discourse, these stories served dual
political and cultural purposes. First, they undermined the authority of
the dominant Edwardian currents of state-governed socialism and suffragist
feminism while encouraging alternative forms of worker-governed socialism
and individualist feminism. Second, they initiated a closely related shift
from an influential Edwardian aesthetics of materiality and discursivity
toward a new modernist aesthetics of spiritual liberation and perceptual
immediacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The New Age</I> (1907-22) is of great relevance to an
understanding of the early politics of British modernism. From
1907-14, this weekly magazine, which had a large and diverse
circulation base of more than 3,000 readers was not only the most
significant clearinghouse of anticapitalist thought in Britain, but it
was also a site of culturally pivotal debate about socialism, feminism,
and the arts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Due to the fierce commitment to freedom of expression of the magazine's
  gifted editor, A. R. Orage, the publication secured contributions from
  many of the most influential intellectuals and artists of the Edwardian
  era, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Walter Sickert,
  G. K. Chesterton, Arnold Bennett, and Hilaire Belloc. In addition,
  Orage's no less pronounced editorial flexibility, love of controversy,
  and gifted eye for young talent, allowed the pages of <I>The New Age</I>
  to accommodate several important political and cultural movements that
  increasingly defined British intellectual life in the years leading
  to World War I.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Politically, <I>The New Age</I> was the birthplace of guild socialism,
a short-lived political theory that combined an anarcho-libertarian
hostility to state authority with a socialist commitment to communal
ownership of the means of production. At the time of its

<B></B>

founding in 1907, most of the magazine's contributors belonged to the
Fabian Society, a small organization of prominent socialist intellectuals
who wished to transfer property from individuals to the state through
gradual parliamentary reform. However, beginning in 1908, Orage began
soliciting articles from a range of dissenting strains of anticapitalist
opinion, most notably from well-known men of letters Chesterton and
Belloc. Out of the heated discussions which ensued, the contributors to
<I>The New Age</I> eventually formulated guild socialism as an alternative
socialist ideology. Unlike the Edwardian Fabians, who sought to redress
capitalist ills through state regulated control of industry, employment,
and social welfare, guild socialism encouraged workers to reject the
systems of elected government, reject state interference in their lives,
and seize control of industry through strikes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The New Age</I> was also the birthplace of an important strain of
individualist feminism with close ties to both guild socialism and
the anarcho-libertarian thought of Dora Marsden's magazines <I>The
Freewoman</I> (1911-2), <I>The New Freewoman</I> , and
<I>The Egoist</I> (1914-20), the latter two of which later served
as equally important sites of modernist literary activity. When <I>The
New Age</I> was rethinking its allegiance to Fabian state socialism,
many of its contributors were simultaneously reexamining their support
for women's suffrage and the organizations that promoted it. These
contributors attacked what they perceived as suffragists' misdirected
focus on celebrating motherhood, a stance they believed kept women
intellectually crippled. And they also demanded that suffragists--like
striking laborers--desist from placing all their hopes in the vote and
take full responsibility for their own liberation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most significantly, <I>The New Age</I> was a key birthplace of
British modernism. In conjunction with the magazine's efforts to
combine a tenacious commitment to individual liberty with a larger
project of collective political liberation, a related aesthetic
shift took place. Initially, the magazine championed the writings of
Fabian-affiliated authors Shaw, Wells, and Bennett, whose work was
widely thought to be (however counterintuitive this may sound today)
the most revolutionary and avant-garde of the period. But as Fabianism
lost favor in the magazine, so did these authors, whose plays and novels
were thought to share state socialism's indifference to matters of spirit
and individual freedom. Increasingly embracing the work of younger and,
at the time, relatively unknown literary res such as Katherine
Mansfield, T. E. Hulme, and Ezra Pound, these artists' contributions to
<I>The New Age</I> offered an attractive alternative to the work of Shaw,
Wells, and Bennett and an equally attractive ideological basis for an
antistatist political culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest published stories in <I>The New Age,</I> those
that appeared between February and August 1910, participated in this
political and cultural ferment through their prominent and forcefully
negative portrayals of German imperial culture and maternity. By
criticizing Germans and motherhood, they castigated a tendency among
Fabian socialists, suffragists, and their respective fellow-travelers,
to regard citizens as physical specimens and national commodities. As
critics have often noted, these stories highlight the supposedly abhorrent
corporeality of German culture. For example, "Germans at Meat" (3 March
1910) depicts a group of German diners at a rest cure

<B></B>

pension as crudely voracious creatures obsessed with consumption,
excretion, and conquest. When not dripping soup on their clothing or
remarking on how well their digestive tracts "retain" certain foods,
they make hostile sexual comments to the story's English narrator
and unambiguously threaten her homeland with attack. At the beginning
of the tale, while describing his prowess at consuming large English
breakfasts, the aptly named Herr Rat boasts, "I have had all I wanted
from women without marriage" (<I>SS</I> 37). Then, reinforcing the close
relation of his unconstrained appetites for women and English cuisine,
he stares at the young narrator in a manner that suggests a desire not
just to rape her but to conquer England. "He fixed his cold blue eyes on
me with an expression which suggested a thousand premeditated invasions"
(<I>SS</I> 38). Later, another guest at the pension makes the link between
sexual violence and German military attack even more explicit by casting
the relationship between Germany and England as one between a powerful
male and a defenseless woman: "'Don't be afraid,' Herr Hoffmann said,
'We don't want England. If we did we would have had her long ago'"
(<I>SS</I> 40).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest <I>New Age</I> stories are also, as has often been
recognized, fiercely antimaternal. They express anger and disgust with
the physical traumas and disrements of pregnancy. The "Frau" in "The
Child-Who-Was-Tired" (24 February 1910) complains that her "insides are
all twisted up from having children too quickly" (<I>SS</I> 97).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  The young waitress in "At 'Lehmann's'" (7 July 1910) can hardly bear
  the sight of the pregnant wife of her employer, regarding the woman's
  enormous swollen belly as "ugly--ugly--ugly" (ibid. 76).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  And the narrator of "Frau Fischer" (18 August 1910) boldly declares, "I
  consider child-bearing the most ignominious of professions" (ibid. 55).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While some scholars have perceived that Mansfield's early fiction is
anti-German and antimaternal, however, none has recognized the extent
to which these aspects of her work are ideologically intertwined. In
the context of prewar British cultural discourse Germany was not only
regarded as an immediate military threat to Britain, but also considered
a nation whose dynamic birthrate and economy posed long-term questions
about the status of Britain as a great power. For many of Mansfield's
contemporaries, Germany's military ambitions and birthrate were obverse
sides of a single coin: if left unchallenged, they would together spell
doom for Britain's imperial aspirations. These widely held cultural
anxieties were of enormous concern to the milieu of Edwardian intellectual
debate out of which Mansfield's stories emerged.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although neither Shaw nor Wells expressed animosity towards Germany,
they and other Fabian-affiliated intellectuals in <I>The New Age</I>
believed that the nation represented a challenge to Britain. Shaw had
long been concerned with preserving British imperial hegemony in the
face of increasing foreign competition. As early as <I>Fabianism and the
Empire</I> , he sought to stem national decline by laying plans
for the "effective social organisation of the whole Empire."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  And by the time he published <I>Getting Married</I>  at the height
  of Britain's naval arms race with Germany, he expressed great concern
  at the "alarming rapidity" with which British marriage practices were
  "beginning to depopulate the country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Wells, too, regarded German industry and population growth as threats
  to British imperial ambitions. In his novel <I>The</I> 

<B></B>

<I>New Machiavelli</I> , the protagonist direly warns that "Germany
is beating England in every matter upon which competition is possible":
"Germany, with a much larger population, a vigorous and irreconcilable
proletariat, a bolder intellectual training, a harsher spirit, can
scarcely fail to drive us at last to a realization of intolerable strain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, Germany was in many ways the model upon which Edwardian
socialists sought to base their proposed reforms. Questions of "national
efficiency" and racial fitness, of which Germany was considered a leader,
became prominent concerns of the Fabian Society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  The Society, actively seeking to influence British governmental policy,
  quickly proposed a program of state regulatory control of industry,
  employment, housing, health, and sanitation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  It was thought that such interference with the free market would not
  only secure greater social justice, but also enable "the Englishman,"
  in Shaw's words, to do what "the German can do in social organization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  In a less official context, Shaw and Wells promoted the role of eugenics
  in raising the birthrate and improving the nation's racial stock.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  In <I>Man and Superman</I> , Shaw called for "the socialization
  of the selective breeding of man," and in <I>The New Machiavelli,</I>
  Wells's protagonist proposed to "biologize imperialism": "Women
  . . . must become more and more subordinated as individually independent
  citizens to the collective purpose" of "bearing and rearing good
  children."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Although these were more radical proposals than either man was willing
  to subscribe to in his more strictly political writings, they reflect
  a belief that biology and breeding were vital national concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield was keenly aware of the perceived link between the German
military threat and presumed British racial decline. In "Germans at
Meat," the same uncouth Germans who blatantly threaten invasion make
much of the fact that England's birthrate is declining.

These same Germans further suggest that England's soldiers are physically
unprepared to counter a German attack. After the narrator assures her
fellow diners that neither she nor her countrymen are afraid of invasion,
Herr Rat responds, "Well, then,

<B></B>

you ought to be. . . . You have got no army at all--a few little boys
with their veins full of nicotine poisoning" (<I>SS</I> 40).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Mansfield clearly regarded Germany as a military threat, she
flatly rejected the idea that Britain needed to compete with Germany
on its own terms. Not only are her stories unrepentantly antimaternal,
they are also deeply critical of what she perceives as the Germans'
obsession with the physical and the sexual. They suggest that Germans'
preoccupation with bodily concerns makes them willing participants
in their own spiritual debasement and social commodification. This is
particularly evident in the case of the Widow in "Germans at Meat." By
having this character pick her teeth with a hairpin while criticizing
the narrator's vegetarianism and childlessness, Mansfield demonstrates
that Germans' concern with carnality and breeding is inherently coarse
and degrading. In addition, by having her blithely speak about babies
being placed on a supper-table amidst a wealth of foodstuffs, Mansfield
insinuates that Germans regard themselves and their children as little
more than national and familial resources, a point confirmed by the
jingoistic Traveller, who loudly proclaims Germany to be "the home of
the family" while biting into his potato.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is too infrequently noted that Mansfield regularly celebrated the
efforts of women to escape this demeaning social model in her fiction. The
same semiautobiographical narrator who fends off the slights and insults
of her fellow diners in "Germans at Meat" equally vigorously defends her
spiritual integrity and intellectual independence in other tales. In
"The Luft Bad" (24 March 1910), she resists strong social pressure to
define herself in physical terms. The story is set in an open-air German
spa where men on one side of an enclosure are "chopping down trees and
sawing through planks, dashing heavy weights to the ground, and singing
part songs," and women on the other are encouraging the narrator to dress
in "nothing larger than a handkerchief" and join them in sunbathing and
talking about the "ailments and measurements and ills that flesh is heir
to" (<I>SS</I> 79). However, after watching a young woman speak pantingly
of how she is "perspiring so splendidly" and listening to "the brownest
woman" she had ever seen talk of the benefits of eating only raw fruit,
nuts, and vegetables, the narrator refuses to be shamed into parading
around half naked or focusing exclusively on her weight or physical
conditioning (<I>SS</I> 80). Turning her back on these women, she climbs
on a swing and, in a brief moment of psychological and emotional freedom,
ascends towards "white clouds trail[ing] delicately through the blue sky"
(<I>SS</I> 81).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "Frau Fischer," Mansfield's narrator similarly resists social pressure
to define herself in terms of sex and childbearing. Throughout the story,
the title character, a loud and overbearing widow, takes an intrusive
interest in the marital status and sex lives of all the young women she
encounters. When she first arrives at the pension where the narrator is
staying, Frau Fischer upbraids a widowed pension employee for not having
married off any of her eligible young daughters. Although Frau Hartmann,
"in an ashamed and apologetic voice," explains, "We are such a happy
family since my dear man died," Frau Fischer is decidedly unsympathetic to
the idea that her daughters might be happier free of husbands (<I>SS</I>
50). "But these marriages--one must have courage; and after all, give
them time, they all make the happy family bigger--thank

<B></B>

God for that. . ." (<I>SS</I> 51). In keeping with the replacement
of a picture of Jesus Christ by that of the Kaiser in Frau Fischer's
room, the intrusive widow is concerned only that these daughters have
lots of children. When she attempts to impose her views on the story's
wedded but childless narrator, however, she meets with far more spirited
opposition. Far from being intimidated by Frau Fischer's criticisms of
her childlessness or the fact that she is staying at the pension without
her husband, Mansfield's narrator boldly declares childrearing, as already
indicated, "the most ignominious of all professions," casually claims to
"like empty beds," and stiffly rebuffs the widow's efforts to draw her
into further conversation (<I>SS</I> 55).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By thus repudiating the idea that citizens should be regarded as physical
specimens, sexual vessels, and national commodities, Mansfield did more
than criticize a purportedly German social ideal; she played a crucial
and heretofore unacknowledged role in the discrediting and redirection
of those Edwardian currents in <I>The New Age</I> that subscribed to this
ideal. For example, she implicitly cast doubt on the wisdom of addressing
capitalist inequities through the Fabian model of state regulatory
control. This is particularly apparent when one compares her fiction
with the contemporaneous political criticisms of Chesterton and Belloc,
who did more than anyone else in <I>The New Age</I> to stir indignation
against the Fabians. In his criticisms of the 1909 Minority Report of
the Poor Law Commission (the Fabian Society's most detailed blueprint
for the formation of a socialist welfare state) Belloc argued that this
ostensibly humanitarian reform proposal sought to organize "the poor like
a flock of sheep" . He revealed that clause 29 granted governmental
committees control over "that province of enquiry that is most offensive
to the poor (cross-examination upon their physical condition, interfering
with domestic arrangements, the enforcing of compulsory vaccinations,
etc.)" (ibid. 556). He also bitterly disclosed that clause 82 provided
for "management" of "the able-bodied unemployed." Quoting from the report
itself, he pointed out that if unemployed members of the proletariat could
not find work through one of the proposed labor exchanges designed to
eliminate unemployment, this clause "granted" these unfortunate members
of society assistance in a labor "colony" where they were "'to receive'
(by force of course) 'such physical and mental training' as the politician
'may think fit.'" (<I>SS</I> 557)
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  While Mansfield's stories were not so pointedly political, they no less
  vehemently rejected the idea that men and women should be regarded as
  material resources.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's stories also undermined faith in Shavian and Wellsian
eugenics, which enjoyed considerable popularity at the time among
socialist intellectuals. By revealing the brutalizing and debasing effects
of excessive interest in birth and sex in her stories, she added her voice
to those of a variety of essayists in <I>The New Age</I> who sought to
show that eugenicists were leading Britain down a path to barbarism. Like
M. D. Eder, who in 1909 had described eugenics as a "criminal doctrine"
that would lead to "slaughter" and the oligarchic division of humanity
into two unequal classes--"leaders on one side, hewers of wood and drawers
of water on the other"--she decried the application of principles of
animal husbandry and slaveholding to free citizens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  She also echoed Francis Grierson, who in 1910 talked of the dangers of
  "'progressive' thinkers"

<B></B>

denying "the psychic part of man." Pointing, like Mansfield,
apprehensively toward Germany, "the hot-bed of modern materialism,"
he asserted, "Nothing but a hatch now separates us from primitive
barbary. Underneath is the lair of the wild beast, whose growls are
as audible and menacing as were those of the old Roman arena when Rome
thirsted for blood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield even aligned her fiction with <I>The New Age</I>'s growing
tendency to regard the spiritual liberation of rank-and-file laborers
as the proper focus of socialist revolution. Her stories' celebration of
female spirit and identity amidst demeaning social circumstances clearly
paralleled the magazine's valorization of working class efforts to defend
their industrialism and integrity in the face of capitalist exploitation
and state socialist meddling. This is especially evident in Orage's

was not yet clear that these spontaneous demonstrations of discontent
could provide the basis for a worker-led reorganization of industry

In short, the editor and contributors to <I>The New Age</I>--Mansfield
in particular--regarded women's and workers' growing awareness of
their innate psychological worth as offering an amplified scope for
human endeavor, a model for social reconstruction not predicated on the
brutish management of one's fellow citizens.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to participating in the refashioning of Edwardian socialism,
Mansfield's anti-German stories played a pivotal if still unrecognized
part in the reformulation of mainstream Edwardian feminism, one that
preceded the more celebrated contributions of Marsden by over a year. By
suggesting that women who willingly embraced the "ignominious profession"
of childbearing demeaned themselves and inhibited the development of
untapped spiritual and mental faculties, she identified her writings with
a combative new strain of individualist feminism. This is especially
clear when one situates her fiction in relation to contemporaneous
critical polemics by her friend Beatrice Hastings. Like Mansfield,
Hastings and her feminist allies in <I>The New Age</I> mocked the idea
that motherhood was an ideal that feminists should encourage or pursue,
all well before Marsden raised the same issues in her magazines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  One contributor to the magazine found it appalling that suffragists
  claimed that they would use the "Power of the Vote" to "protect the
  mother and help the child," indeed to do their "duty to the race." "We
  wax very hot over the question of the mother and the child at our
  meetings," she commented in 1909, "and we pat ourselves on the back
  and tell ourselves we are doing something very heroic in getting so
  hot in so noble a cause." In her view, the physical experience of
  motherhood was far from ennobling: "It is a very pleasant sensation
  to suckle a child,

<B></B>

if one can; so pleasant that the mother's sensuous enjoyment is frequently
reflected in . . . the vacuous smile of one whose brain is empty and
whose body is at ease."

Hastings was no less critical of feminist idealizations of
maternity. Indeed she found it unconscionable that international feminist
author Olive Schreiner could encourage women in her study <I>Women and
Labour</I>  to discover "the joy of giving life, the glory and
beatitude of a virile womanhood." "The choice before the majority of
women," commented Hastings in 1911,

is to enter the professions, arts, and crafts by force and in force or to
degenerate. Olive Schreiner, however, is not content to give this plain
and sensible piece of advice, but she must needs spoil it entirely by an
unnecessary, a reactionary, and, indeed, an inconsistent addition. It
is a great truth, she declares, "and one on which I should not fear to
challenge the verdict of long future generations," that the endeavour
of women should be "towards a higher appreciation of the sacredness of
all sex relations." If that is to be the case then farewell to any hope
of women taking all labour for their province and competing with men
in professions, arts, and crafts. For the truth must be told that it is
precisely by <I>lowering</I> his appreciation of the sacredness of all
sex relations that intellectual man at any rate has won his position. Nor
should we fear to challenge the verdict of long future generations that
the same deflation of the importance of sex will prove necessary to
women if they are to enter the intellectual spheres where men now labour.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Hastings's opinion, by "exaggerat[ing] the importance of sex and
parentage," Schreiner encouraged women to enter the professions with
a crippling "mother-hunger still in their hearts," in short to be, as
Mansfield's fiction suggested, insufficiently intellectual and serious
in their pursuit of individual fulfillment.

The most important and lasting contribution that Mansfield's stories
made was to the reconceptualization of what it meant to be aesthetically
innovative. As her anti-German stories came to occupy an ever more
prominent place in the magazine, Orage and other contributors increasingly
accused the widely esteemed literature of Shaw, Wells, and Bennett--as
Mansfield indirectly did--of being guilty of the "tendency . . . to
deny the existence of [the] soul and to regard it as, at best, only a
compound of the appetites, desires, and experiences of the mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  <I>The New Age</I>'s drama critic, Ashley Dukes, denounced Shaw for
  treating his plays' characters as the Fabians treated the working
  classes--that is, as little more than objects of national appropriation
  and maintenance. Excoriating Shaw's materialism in 1911, he remarked,

In a close echo of Mansfield's "Germans at Meat," Orage criticized Wells
in the same year for glorifying sexual experiences "no more fraught with
meaning than eating or drinking or sweating."

  "merely reproductive."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's fiction also served as the leading edge of an effort
to reconceive the early twentieth-century aesthetic avant-garde in
psychological and spiritual terms. Although she is not generally discussed
in relation to Hulme and Pound, who also wrote extensively for <I>The New
Age,</I> she shared their desire to break with widely held materialistic
conceptions of human nature. Like their groundbreaking Imagist poetry,
which in Hulme's words sought through the expression of "individual
idiosyncrasy" to give form to evanescent moments of consciousness that
revealed the world to be a place of "freedom and chance," Mansfield's
stories attempted to disclose vistas of intellectual and spiritual
freedom that existed outside materially defined boundaries of identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  What is more, her tales also set the oppositional terms by which
  Virginia Woolf and other major modern novelists would later lay claim to
  cultural authority. Long before Woolf's celebrated 1921 essay "Modern
  Fiction" took Bennett and Wells to task for being "materialists"
  concerned more with the "body" than the "soul," Mansfield's tales
  offered a comparable critique in more specifically political terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other means by which Mansfield facilitated the emergence of new
variants of socialism, feminism, and modern literature was more strictly
formalistic. By rejecting plot and discourse and foregrounding the
dangers of abstract conceptual language in her more self-consciously
modernist stories of late fall, she criticized a widespread tendency
among Edwardian socialists and feminists to encourage the political
delegation of agency. In addition, she aligned her fiction with a
contrasting movement to advocate self-government in politics and
perceptual immediacy in aesthetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The two stories that best exemplify these concerns are the companion
pieces "The Journey to Bruges" (24 August 1911) and "Being a Truthful
Adventure" (7 September 1911). Like most of Mansfield's finest work,
neither provides obvious plot development or conceptual focus. In
paradigmatic modernist fashion, each story unfolds in an apparently random
manner, without the benefit of the kind of orienting authorial comment
that was so prominent in Edwardian and late Victorian fiction. In "The
Journey to Bruges," for example, the semiautobiographical first-person
narrator encounters a range of more or less ordinary individuals during
her travels, none of whom becomes the subject of thematic scrutiny
or plays a significant part in subsequent events. At the beginning of
the story, the attention she directs towards two young men in her train
compartment suggests that they will go on to play prominent roles. Their
dialogue, which is reported almost entirely without comment, gives
every indication of building towards a conflict that will require
resolution. Playfully dubbed "the Enthusiast" and "the Mole" by the
narrator--the former for his excited talk and the latter for his neutral,
gray clothing--a tension almost immediately manifests itself between
them upon their taking their seats:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Look here, old man," said the Enthusiast, "I want to change all our
places. You know those arrangements you've made--I want to cut them out
altogether. Do you mind?"

<B></B>

"No," said the Mole, faintly. "But why?" "Well, I was thinking it over
in bed last night, and I'm hanged if I can see the good of us paying
fifteen bob if we don't want to. You see what I mean?" The Mole took
off his pince-nez and breathed on them. "Now I don't want to unsettle
you," went on the Enthusiast, "because, after all, it's your party--you
asked me. I wouldn't upset it for anything, but--there you are--you
see--what?" Suggested the Mole: "I'm afraid people will look down on me
for taking you abroad" [<I>SS</I> 14].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the fact that the narrator tells us, "My heart yearned over
the Mole's immediate future," this plot thread and potential source of
thematic focus cuts off almost as abruptly as it begins (ibid. 15). After
the Enthusiast denies the Mole's last statement, insisting on "how sought
after he had been," the two companions nap the remainder of the journey,
only waking to disembark from the train and leave narrator and reader
forever ignorant as to how they will sort out their differences (ibid.).

Other portions of "The Journey to Bruges" refuse equally forcefully
to cohere into a linear narrative. Although readers today would not
find the story particularly disorienting, it would have challenged the
expectations of readers of Shaw's, Wells's, and Bennett's works, which
even at their most unconventional remained concerned with viewing life
through an organizing lens of ideas. The story begins:

A German family, their luggage neatly buttoned into what appeared to be
 odd canvas trouser legs, filled the entire space before the counter, and
 a homeopathic young clergyman, his black dicky flapping over his shirt,
 stood at my elbow. We waited and waited, for the cloak-room porter could
 not get rid of the German family, who appeared to be explaining to him
 by their enthusiasm and gestures the virtue of so many buttons. At last
 the wife of the party seized her particular packet and started to undo
 it. Shrugging his shoulders, the porter turned to me. "Where for?" he
 asked. [<I>SS</I> 13]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tale commences in medias res, without any omniscient narrative
voice to contextualize the porter's remarks or even to identify their
intended recipient. Are the porter's words directed at a member of
the German family that is introduced in the second paragraph? The
tale's first-person narrator? The answer is not at first apparent or
unequivocally ascertainable. Even after reference is made to the German
"wife," ambiguity remains as to whether she is absolutely the "lady"
in question. Likewise, it is not at first evident what causes the German
family to frustrate the porter. The fact that there is a language barrier
must be inferred from their impassioned "gestures" and baffling behavior.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield gives readers no more conceptual overview of events than her
first-person narrator possesses at the time they take place. Like Hulme
and Pound--her modernist compatriots in <I>The New Age</I>--she exhibits
a close affinity with such turn of the century philosophers as Friedrich
Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, William James, and F. H. Bradley, who argued
that reality lay in the immediate flux of sensory appearance and not in
a rational, conceptual order beyond it. The disclosure of information
in "The Journey to Bruges" is rigorously sensory and retains much of
the unexplained

<B></B>

and aleatory flavor of raw perception. No one's name is disclosed, the
specific cause of the German family's agitation is never identified,
and the "odd canvas trouser legs" that hold the family's luggage remain
mysteriously foreign. Despite the fact that the narrator later remarks
of the clergyman, "My sensitiveness glimpsed a symbol in his eye,"
we are never told the nature of this symbol (<I>SS</I> 13).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Nor does he or the German family play any subsequent role in the
  tale. Like the Enthusiast and the Mole, who also remain nameless,
  these res simply join a host of randomly encountered individuals
  in the story who enable Mansfield to represent the fragmentary and
  discontinuous quality of immediate, quotidian experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although "Being a Truthful Adventure" is less rigorously antidiscursive
than "The Journey to Bruges," it is much more overtly polemical. From
the very beginning, the story dramatizes the false lures and perils
of ideational language and thought. At the commencement of the tale,
which picks up where "The Journey to Bruges" leaves off, the exhausted
narrator has arrived in Bruges and is consulting a guidebook while
awaiting a room at a hotel.

"The little town lies spread before the gaze of the eager traveler like
a faded tapestry threaded with the silver of its canals, made musical by
the great chiming belfry. Life is long since asleep in Bruges; fantastic
dreams alone breathe over tower and medieval house front, enchanting the
eye, inspiring the soul and filling the mind with the great beauty of
contemplation." I read this sentence from a guide-book while waiting for
"Madame" in the hotel sitting-room. It sounded extremely comforting, and
my tired heart, tucked away under a thousand and one grey city wrappings,
woke and exulted within me . . . I wondered if I had enough clothes with
me to last for at least a month. [<I>SS</I> 18]

The gaping distance between the high-flown abstractions of the
guidebook promising beauty, dreams, and comfort, and the more palpable
realities of Bruges--which have already left the narrator's "tired heart"
dampened under "a thousand and one grey city wrappings"--establishes the
oppositional thrust of the story. As the narrative unfolds, she discovers
that the "fantastic dreams" promised by the guidebook are nowhere
to be found and that to entrust her "gaze" to this seductive verbal
intermediary is not to achieve a swifter and more authoritative knowledge
of her surroundings, but rather to keep herself ignorant, dependent, and
perpetually disappointed. Instead of spending her stay, as the guidebook
pledges, "filling [her] mind with the great beauty of contemplation,"
the narrator finds herself, while following its instructions, contending
with a succession of insensitive and overbearing service employees whose
efforts to "assist" her are more intrusive than helpful. This culminates
with her taking on the services a surly boatman who insists, against her
express wishes, on talking constantly, taking on unwanted passengers,
and, worst of all, mechanically directing her attention to all the
sights along the canals, "Turn your head this way--to the left--to the
right--now, wait one moment--look up at the bridge (ibid. 22)."

What makes this critique political, and not simply the sour musings of a
disillusioned aesthete or tourist, is the story's ending. There Mansfield
links the perils of ideational language with the illusory promises of
the vote. After escaping the obnoxious

boatman's clutches, the narrator retreats to a meadow where she hopes
finally to view Bruges through her own unaided eyes. No sooner does she
start to examine the landscape around her, however, than an old school
acquaintance, Betty Sinclair, and her recently wed husband--both of
whom have their heads bent over the very same guidebook she has just
abandoned--impose themselves on her:

"Katherine! How extraordinary! How incredible after all these
years!" cried she. . . . "Where are you staying; have you been
here long? Oh you haven't changed a day--not a day. I'd have known
you anywhere." She beckoned to the young man, and said, blushing
as though she were ashamed of the fact, but it had to be faced,
"This is my husband." We shook hands. He sat down and chewed a grass
twig. Silence fell while Betty recovered breath and squeezed my hand. "I
didn't know you were married," I said stupidly. "Oh, my dear--got a
baby!" said Betty. "We live in England now. We're frightfully keen on
the Suffrage, you know." Guy removed the straw. "Are you with us?" he
asked, intensely. I shook my head. He put the straw back again and
narrowed his eyes. "Then here's the opportunity," said Betty. "My dear,
how long are you going to stay? We must go about together and have long
talks. Guy and I aren't a honeymoon couple, you know. We love to have
other people with us sometimes." [. . .] "Unfortunately I have to go
home quite soon. I've had an urgent letter." [. . .] "But the quaint
streets and the Continental smells, and the lace makers--if we could
just wander about--we three--and absorb it all." I sighed and bit my
underlip. "What's your objection to the vote?" asked Guy. [ . . . ]
"I always had the idea that you were so frightfully keen on the future
of women," said Betty. "Come to dinner with us to-night. Let's thrash
the whole subject out. You know, after the strenuous life in London,
one does seem to see things in such a different light in this old-world
city." "Oh, a very different light indeed," I answered, shaking my head at
the familiar guide-book emerging from Guy's pocket. [<I>SS</I> 23-4]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although it might seem surprising at first that the story's independent
young narrator, who travels by herself across Europe, should be so cool
towards Betty and "the suffrage," she makes the grounds of her contempt
clear by linking both with the discredited guidebook. Whereas the narrator
has come to distrust the abstract language of the guidebook--regarding
as specious its promise to provide a more satisfying and authoritative
knowledge of her surroundings than she can achieve on her own--Betty
remains its dupe, just as she also remains the gull of a woman's suffrage
movement that makes equally abstract pledges on behalf of the vote. She
has na&iuml;vely entrusted her gaze to this seductive text and gushes
blithely about "quaint streets" and "Continental smells" of which she
obviously has no first-hand knowledge.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This disabling delegation of authority to the guidebook parallels Betty's
equally crippling delegation of feminist agency to women's suffrage
organizations. Betty clearly believes that in order to be "keen on the
future of women" one need only place one's trust in the suffrage cause,
that voicing support for the vote will cure gender inequality and other
feminist concerns far more quickly and effectively than any individual
acts of her own. But as Mansfield is at pains to demonstrate, just as
the abstract language of the guidebook leaves its readers fundamentally
ignorant of Bruges, so too does Betty's voluble talk about the vote
leave her unenlightened as to her own continued enslavement to gender
conventions and male dominance. Excepting her attachment to the

<B></B>

suffrage cause, she could not be more captive to custom. She has a young
child, enthuses about lace, and bubbles over with sentimental prattle
of a stereotyped "feminine" nature. Above all, she remains unable to
imagine a role for herself outside her marriage. When Betty proposes
that she and the narrator "go about together and have long talks," it
never occurs to her not to include her husband Guy. She ironically takes
pride in the fact that she and Guy "love to have other people with [them]
sometimes," not realizing just how much such a comment reveals about her
lack of independence. Similarly, when she talks about her enthusiasm for
"the Suffrage," she always does so using the pronoun "we," as he uses
"us," as if the cause were as much her husband's as her own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contrast between Betty and the narrator is particularly instructive
in outlining the grounds of Mansfield's critique. The story ends by
establishing a sharp contrast between two kinds of feminism, each shaped
by a different approach to language. The first is of the type espoused
by Betty. It is more a matter of talk than deeds, of having "long talks"
about the vote and "thrash[ing] the whole subject out" over dinner. The
second is quietly exemplified by the narrator, who has rejected not only
mediated knowledge and agency, but also all idle speech. The narrator may
never identify herself as a feminist, but it is clear from Betty's shock
that she does not support the vote and by her fiercely independent actions
that the narrator not only has a well-established reputation for feminism
but that she also acts on her beliefs. By traveling alone, rejecting
the authority of the guidebook, and refusing to be intimidated by Guy's
"intense" questioning, she demonstrates that she will cede her autonomy
to no one. What is more, her reluctance to give expression to her views
or idly engage Betty in conversation attests to the deep seriousness of
her commitments. In contrast to Betty's ceaseless shallow conversation,
which is regularly punctuated by such empty phrases as "you know" and "my
dear," the narrator's silent nods and terse statements bespeak a refusal
to trivialize her feminist principles, to substitute talk for action.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By criticizing women's suffrage in these terms, Mansfield contributed
in fundamental and heretofore unrecognized ways to the development of a
new antistatist political culture. As with her criticisms of the German
social ideal, her antidiscursive stories are an aesthetic elaboration
of the political commentary of unlikely modernist forebears Chesterton
and Belloc, whose criticisms of representative government, like their
critiques of state regulation, played a key role in fostering a climate of
hostility to Fabian socialism. In 1909, two years before "The Journey to
Bruges" and "Being a Truthful Adventure" appeared in <I>The New Age,</I>
Chesterton criticized parliamentary politics--in terms later taken up by
Mansfield--for being overly abstract, insufficiently grounded in immediate
experience. As someone who believed that property was the foundation of
all power, he contended that Fabian faith in the efficacy of democratic
political reform was fundamentally misguided. In his view, electing a
socialist majority to Parliament would not lead (as many Fabians supposed)
to the "taking away of the private fortunes" of capitalists. Instead,
it would result in these same financial oligarchs, through the influence
of their wealth, continuing under a socialist guise "to manage our yet
more concentrated affairs." He wrote, "A small, rich, and generally

<B></B>

trusted class . . . are the masters of England; they will probably be
the masters of any big political reform, including Socialism; they will
be the masters, because they will be the paymasters."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1911, Belloc expanded these arguments in <I>The Party
  System,</I> a book he coauthored with Chesterton's disaffected Fabian
  socialist brother Cecil. By affirming in her fiction that the vote
  was largely substanceless, Mansfield lent support to Chesterton and
  Belloc's arguments that, until socialists, laborers, and other enemies
  of plutocracy directed their attention to the foundation of capitalist
  power (property and money), any electoral victory won by Fabians
  or laborers would be purely illusory--the victory of "inapplicable
  theoretic abstraction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a similar manner, Mansfield implicitly supported Orage's calls
for greater labor emphasis on strikes. Her rejection of the vote and
encouragement of the direct seizure of sociopolitical independence by
women was an extension of his efforts to encourage greater self-reliance
among the working classes. As early as 1910, Orage had argued that
organized labor did not have "anything whatever to gain by being in
politics at all." He wrote,

Calling attention to the steep decline in wages that had coincided with
organized labor's entrance into party politics--much as Mansfield would
later call attention to the feminist backsliding that attended women's
involvement in suffrage politics--he advocated direct action in the form
of strikes. "The governing classes are infinitely less afraid of the
working-man's vote than of his strike," he declared, a point that would
only grow in significance over the next year as wildcat work stoppages
rocked Britain, terrifying capitalists and revealing fault lines between
government and rank-and-file laborers that <I>The New Age</I> regarded
as the promising beginning of a new, worker-led form of socialism and
industrial reorganization.

As important a role as Mansfield's antidiscursive stories played
in the early foundation of guild socialism, they performed an even
more pronounced part in the continued propagation of individualist
feminism. Like her critique of the German social ideal, Mansfield's
critique of the vote is inextricably linked to the now critically
underappreciated but at the time path-clearing model of feminist politics
practiced by Hastings, who in conjunction with Mansfield's fictional
endeavors, developed a modernist and libertarian-tinged strain of feminism
that has mistakenly been thought to have been the sole creation of Dora
Marsden. Beginning in 1909, when Marsden was still a loyal member of
the Women's Social and Political Union, Hastings criticized suffrage
politics--in a manner that Mansfield later embraced--for being every bit
as disconnected from immediate, individual experience as conventional
party politics. Under the pseudonym D. Triformis, one of several names
under which Hastings wrote to give the illusion that her views were held
by a critical mass of contributors, she

<B></B>

mocked the leaders of the W.S.P.U. for promising, "in an orgie of
chimerical benevolence," that the vote could protect "married women
from rivalry" and provide for a "regular lien on the wages" of their
husbands. While she admitted that "the position of all women would be
improved by the removal of the sex disability in politics and that the
vote [was] a symbol of the moral restoration of womanhood," she denied
that the vote was anything more than a symbol. "Decidedly we object to
the illusory hopes held out to the married woman that when such women as
pay taxes shall have the vote the conditions of marriage will change for
the better," she asserted. "The million and a half future women electors
could not honestly promise any change at all, even if this million and
a half were all bent in the same direction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Mansfield, Hastings criticized suffrage politics for leaving its
adherents fundamentally unaware of their own continued submission to
gender conventions and male dominance. In a 1909 letter to the magazine
under the pseudonym "Beatrice Tina," the name she used to publish her
notorious feminist polemic <I>Woman's Worst Enemy--Woman</I> ,
she argued, "Some of the leading suffragists who hail Mary Wollstonecraft
as their model would cut that free-living woman dead if they could meet
her to-day in a social gathering."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1910, she claimed that the leaders of the W.S.P.U. were more
  concerned with the reactionary strengthening of the bonds of marriage
  than they were with freeing women from custom and convention. In her
  view, the "payment of wives by individual men," the most ill-considered
  and unrealistic of the organization's promised reforms, was "a revolting
  idea." Far from being a possible step towards greater liberty for women,
  it was merely "a further scheme for protection." Until women took
  it upon themselves to assert their independence--a point emphasized
  by Mansfield in her fiction--the vote would accomplish nothing for
  them. To the plea that "the world is hard upon woman," she responded,

which are more cruel and rigid than any man-made laws. . . . Until
domestic women themselves perceive their folly, their degradation,
and the ill-effects of their home-made rules against each other, the
more intellectual suffrage societies had better avoid them and their
plaintive petitions and charters.

Finally, in order to gauge the full extent of Mansfield's identification
of her early fiction with individualist feminism, the formerly
unremarked parallels between her fiction and the feminist polemics
of Women's Freedom League founder Teresa Billington-Greig must be
disclosed. In January 1911, in a major coup for Hastings and Orage,
"Truculent Teresa" quit the W.F.L., a splinter group of the W.S.P.U., and
published in <I>The New Age</I> the first fruits of her long-simmering
discontent with the women's suffrage movement. These scathing articles,
which later formed the basis of her celebrated treatise <I>The Militant
Suffrage Movement--Emancipation in a Hurry</I> , lent authority
to Hastings's longstanding criticisms. Billington-Greig claimed, as
Mansfield shortly would, that the W.S.P.U. had betrayed the cause of
feminism, that in its exclusive pursuit of the vote it had forsaken
more fundamental fields of feminist endeavor. She also contended that
"feminist rebels" had initially rallied to the W.S.P.U.

<B></B>

because they found in the organization's "abandonment of the worship of
propriety" an "aggressive proclamation" of "the right of insurrection"
and "the right of self-government." But now that the W.S.P.U., in its
haste to acquire the vote, had reached out for the support of those
respectable, tax-paying women who would be most likely to benefit from
any initial reform of the franchise, the organization had succeeded only
in reducing itself to something "quite commonplace and conventional"--"a
movement of political revivalism." In commentary that could almost have
served as a blueprint for Mansfield's criticism of Betty in "Being a
Truthful Adventure," Billington-Greig argued that the W.S.P.U. sought to
"impose a yoke of emotional control" and "mental and spiritual slavery"
on its members that corrupted the entire suffrage cause.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  "The women who succumb" to this yoke, she declared,

exhibit a type of self-subjection not less objectionable than the more
ordinary self-subjection of women to men, to which it bears a close
relation. The yoke is imposed by a mingling of deliberately worked up
emotion, by the exercise of affectational and personal charm. . . . As
with all emotional degradation its victims glory in it. Every woman
snared ensnares her fellow and adds the weight of her obsession to the
burden upon the minds of the rest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In sum, her comments confirm that Mansfield's criticism of suffrage
politics does not stem solely from personal experience--as the very
title of "Being a Truthful Adventure" might suggest--but arises within
and belongs to the most important antisuffrage critiques of the period.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prewar British modernism poses a dilemma to those who wish to link
its multifarious aesthetic experiments to a readily identifiable set
of political affiliations. While it is not obviously conservative in
outlook, neither is it identifiably leftist, liberal, or of the radical
right. Scholars who attempt to place early modernists in any one of these
camps are usually compelled to ignore evidence to the contrary. Mansfield
poses particular problems in this respect. Not only is she often not
properly admitted to be a modernist at all, but the tensions that are
manifest in her fiction rarely seem ideological in any familiar sense. If
one views Mansfield's fiction in the critically neglected intellectual
context of <I>The New Age,</I> however, it is possible to begin to
resolve this long-standing conundrum of modernist scholarship. Doing so
demonstrates that prewar British politics frequently directed different
lines of division than we are accustomed to encountering today. Socialism
itself was more fluid and open to definition at the beginning of this
century than our Cold War derived notions of "left" and "right" have led
us to believe--or even enabled us to acknowledge. In short, her fiction
discloses that modernist literary culture was antistatist more importantly
than it was "left" or "right" in contemporary terms. In addition to
including variants that envisioned a powerful role for the state,
there also developed out of debates in <I>The New Age</I> an interest
in formulating an antistatist variant of labor politics. And feminism
was no less various. Thus, out of the debates in the magazine, there
emerged a variant of radical feminism surprisingly hostile to the vote.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Analyzing Mansfield's stories in the context of <I>The New Age</I>
provides strong, fresh evidence of the role that she played in the
politically charged formulation of modernist aesthetic doctrine. It
uncovers the crucial part her fiction played in the critical overturning
of the politics and aesthetics of Fabian-affiliated literary titans
Shaw, Wells, and Bennett and its anticipation of later arguments of
Woolf and Marsden. Revealing that her fiction was at the center of
heated discussions about labor organization, women's suffrage, imperial
policy, and the role of the state in modern government also exposes
her previously unanalyzed affinities with Chesterton, Belloc, Hastings,
and Billington-Greig. Above all, it demonstrates that Mansfield is an
insufficiently appreciated modernist pioneer.

emphasis on the psychological 'moment') preceded Virginia Woolf's use of
them, and they have been absorbed and assimilated--often unconsciously--by

In a sketchbook for 1964, Jasper Johns began to make notes for
his paintings <I>Watchman</I> and <I>According to What.</I> On one
particularly tantalizing page, he makes a sketch for what would appear
in both paintings as the wax cast of a man's lower torso, positioned on
the seat of a chair, itself bisected vertically to accommodate the depth
of the fragmented re (<A HREF="8.2perloff_1.html"> 1</A>).

What or who are watchman and spy? "If the artist is the spy (never
depicted)," writes Francis M. Naumann in a 1992 catalogue essay,
"the watchman is the spectator/critic, a member of the viewing
audience. In his capacity as a spectator, the watchman remains momentarily
inactive--seated--his disoriented position and fragmentation suggesting
that he has, as Johns has predicted, fallen into 'the trap of looking.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  And Michael Crichton takes the distinction even more literally, "The
  notes suggest that this is a picture about looking. They identify the
  cast of the leg and chair, inverted in one corner; that is the watchman
  (falling into the trap of looking?)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 But why would Johns, who always resisted allegorical readings of his
 work, refer to the "spectator/critic" as a mysterious watchman in
 seemingly endless struggle with an equally mysterious artist-spy? And
 why, to make matters murkier, would he use an encaustic cast of a leg,
 unconnected to a body, as a representation of something as specific
 as this "watchman"? A few pages earlier in Johns's sketchbook where
 the cast of the leg (not yet inverted) is outlined in the upper right,
 next to a hinge picture, we read:

"Avoid a polar / situation": Johns always preferred the "traffic" at
the "edge of the city"--a border situation--to binaries like artist/spy
and spectator/watchman. In his Watchman note, an arrow points from the
enigmatic phrase "'Looking' is &amp; is not 'eating' &amp; also 'being
eaten,'" to the parenthetical comment "Cezanne?--Each object reflecting
the other" (<I>WSI</I> 59). The reference is probably to Gertrude Stein's
observation that "C&eacute;zanne conceived the idea that in composition
one thing was as important as another thing. Each part is as important
as the whole."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  For Johns, as for Stein, composition must be decentered,
  nonhierarchical, each part of the canvas as important as every other
  part.

Thus, unlike, say, Jackson Pollock's all-over drip paintings of the
preceding decade--paintings that, however improvisatory their process of
composition might have been, are characterized, in the words of Johns's
friend Frank O'Hara, by their formal "balance, proportion, and controlled
emotion"--<I>Watchman</I> (<A HREF="8.2perloff_3.html"> 3</A>

  What, for example, is the relation of the three-dimensional body cast
  (the inverted leg), attached to the chair to the wooden ball and
  stick at bottom left? How do both these "real" objects relate to the
  three horizontal brownish-grayish "abstract" sections of the canvas,
  bearing the partially hidden words "RED," "YELLOW," and "BLUE" (only
  their first letters are visible)--words that, confusingly, match not
  the color fields in which they appear, but the three rectangles on the
  right, as if to suggest that observation alone is never sufficient for
  understanding. When I look at <I>Watchman,</I> my eye moves down from
  the disturbing encaustic leg-cast to focus on the wide orange, white,
  and green brushstrokes that seem to replace the cast's missing upper
  torso, brushstrokes that don't blend, thus emphasizing the flatness of
  the canvas. As they cascade downward, they lose their color, giving way
  to a thin gray-brown wash dripping across a partially hidden newspaper
  page to the strip at the bottom, evidently made by dragging the stick
  at the left across the canvas through a layer of wet paint, leaving
  a black-through-white tonal scale covered with drips behind.

In studying the incongruous objects incorporated into Johns's
paintings of the early sixties--for example, the two letters
N and O, cut out of aluminum foil and suspended from a wire in
<I>NO,</I> the ruler and tin cup in <I>Good Time Charley</I> (<A
HREF="8.2perloff_4.html"> 4</A>), the broom, china cup, and
towel in <I>Fool's House</I>--Leo Steinberg comments that for Johns,
the canvas is "not a picture plane, not a window, nor an uprighted
tray, nor yet an object with active projections into actual space;
but a surface observed during impregnation, observed as it receives a
message or imprint from real space."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  In <I>Watchman,</I> the little wooden ball against which a stick leans
  diagonally is just such an imprint, a trace of impregnation that alters
  the surface. But what is the message and who is the spy?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Johns's own comments only compound the mystery. Interviewed by Yoshiaki
Tono in August 1964, after the completion of the painting, he explains
that "The idea for this work first occurred to me two years ago, when
I visited Madame Tussaud's, in London. The image of flesh, the image
of skin--images I had never used before. . . . The idea of the leg of
a person sitting on a chair came to me about a year ago" (<I>WSI</I>
96). As for the verbal account of watchman and spy, Johns dismisses it as
a "play on words." "I don't," he tells Tono, "want you to associate the
essay with the picture" (<I>WSI</I> 96-7). When the latter presses,
remarking that the poet Shin Ooka took the painting to refer to "the trace
of something that had abruptly passed away . . . the end of a drama,"
Johns replies, "For me the picture implies the fall of something, an
interpretation I think is clear from the leg's position in the overall
composition." But lest we start reading the image allegorically as
a fall from innocence or grace or as a wartime execution, he adds
matter-of-factly: "The leg will naturally fall . . . if you cut the
support that attaches the chair to the canvas" (<I>WSI</I> 97). And in
an allusion to Wittgenstein, whose <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>
Johns had been reading with absorption since 1962, he emphasizes his
concern for the context within which meanings are made.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

the bizarre disjunction of art and politics that emerged in the 1960s. The
radical political movements of the 1960s had virtually no expression in
the art of that time, an art that was strangely appealing and acceptable

these radical movements opposed. [<I>D/I</I> 35]

  But Johns, as a representative of the next generation and as the

  went, so she posits, beyond the legendary political indifference and
  negation she associates particularly with Duchamp:

More than any other artist, Johns incorporated in his early art the Cold
War and the McCarthy era preoccupations and moods. This is not to imply
that Johns did this consciously or single-mindedly . . . but what emerges
out of a collective examination of his work is a dense concentration
of metaphors dealing with spying, conspiracy, secrecy and concealment,
misleading information, coded messages and clues. These were the very
subjects of newspaper headlines of the period, reiterated on the radio
and shown on television. . . . [Johns's] early work is a warehouse of
Cold War metaphors. [<I>D/I</I> 43]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument for a subliminal presence of Cold War spying/concealment
imagery in works like <I>Watchman</I> makes more sense than does
the identification of watchman with viewer, spy with artist. But as
Jonathan D. Katz points out in his provocative response to Roth's
piece, published together with hers in <I>Difference/Indifference</I>
, her essay (originally appearing in 1977) fails to account for
the role sexuality played in the artistic choices made by the artists
in question. Ironically, Roth herself referred to Cage, Johns, and
Cunningham as models of "a new breed of artist, an alternative to the

<B></B>

politically concerned abstract expressionists," and cites the sculptor
George Segal's description of the "new" artist as a "slender, cerebral,
philosophical, iconoclastic type," with "a dandylike elegance of body
build and a manner which delighted in cool and elegant plays of the
mind" (<I>D/I</I> 37). "Dandy" is of course a euphemism for gay, and she
acknowledged that the artists in question were predominantly homosexual
or, like Duchamp performing as Rrose S&eacute;lavy, bisexual. Katz, with
the hindsight of twenty years, adds that, given the extreme homophobia
of the postwar era, the "indifference" of the artists in question must be
understood less as "passivity" than as an expression of what he calls the
"double duty" of "camouflage <I>and</I> contestation" that characterized
"the compulsory Cold War closet" (<I>D/I</I> 51). "What Roth refers to
as 'an aesthetic of indifference,'" he writes, "can be more accurately
termed 'a politics of negation,' wherein negation functions as an active
resistance to hegemonic constructions of meaning as natural or inherent
in the work" (<I>D/I</I> 63). The performance of "silence" (or White
Painting), in this scheme of things, testifies to the awareness of the
possibilities of "a newly destabilized and de-essentialized construction
of self" (<I>D/I</I> 55). The "natural," always a mystification of the
social, is replaced by the dandy's "narcissistic pleasures of performative
fluency" (<I>D/I</I> 59).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reminder of the role sexual orientation played in the negative
politics of the Cage circle is a useful antidote to Roth's overly
schematic distinction between a committed and an uncommitted poetry. But
Katz glosses over certain key differences among the artists <I>inside</I>
the circle in question. To understand the role of Johns's "cool" art in
the "activist" sixties, it is useful to read Johns's work against that of
a closely related gay artist, or rather poet (and art critic)--a poet who
was Johns's exact contemporary (born 1926) and, like him, a great admirer
of John Cage, whose <I>Music of Changes,</I> as performed by David Tudor,
he had introduced to a third poet-friend, John Ashbery, as early as 1952.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  I am thinking of course of Frank O'Hara, whose poetry stands behind a
  number of important Johns compositions and vice-versa. At the same time,
  O'Hara's aesthetic, rooted as it was in the fifties, was to prompt
  Johns's own radical rethinking, in the early sixties, of what art
  could be, an art in which the "memory of [one's] feelings" gradually
  gave way to the memory of one's prior works, of what Cage had called,
  in a brilliant meditative essay on Johns's work, "<I>structures, not
  subjects</I>" (<I>YM</I> 75, emphasis added). Cage, Johns, O'Hara:
  the trio makes for an interesting rethinking of Cold War "difference"
  and "indifference."

What had happened? In <I>Off the Wall,</I> Calvin Tomkins reports that

not, as the title might suggest, an homage to a new lover; quite the
contrary. Johns and O'Hara had first met in 1957, but they were not
immediately friends, possibly because O'Hara's primary allegiance, in
his role as curator at the Museum of Modern Art, was to the abstract
expressionists: he was exhibiting (and writing on) Jackson Pollock
and Willem De Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and Helen
Frankenthaler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

There was also the question raised by Moira Roth and Jonathan Katz about
the abstract expressionists' lifestyle: the loud and aggressively macho
Cedar Bar scene was no more congenial to Johns than it had been to Cage,

drunk, and he was actually an unpleasant person for me to encounter. I

 But despite such conflicting loyalties, by 1959 Frank and "Jap" were

Johns's hinged painting (<A HREF="8.2perloff_5.html">5</A>
is divided in half, but the two seemingly matching "halves" are
discordant. In the right half, the "abstract" brushstrokes--predominantly
black and blue with some white and a few color flecks of orange-red--don't
blend: theirs is, in Steinberg's words, a "ceaseless overlap-interlace
of re and ground; a paint surface like knitting or basketry. Not a
shallow space but the quickened density of a film." The "M-W brushstroke"
used here and in related paintings of the early sixties, "functions like
the corrugated staples carpenters use."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  In the left half of the painting, the blue-black paintstrokes thin
  out and drip onto the largely white area near the bottom. In the
  top half, the strokes are obliterated by a more smoothly painted
  brown-grey rectangle, reminiscent of Johns's earlier <I>Canvas</I>
  (<A HREF="8.2perloff_6.html"> 6</A>) and <I>Flags</I> (<A
  HREF="8.2perloff_7.html"> 7</A>). Suspended on a wire from
  a screw near the top of this rectangle is an ordinary silver spoon,
  oddly hung, not by its handle, but upside down, as is the fork whose
  prongs are just visible behind it. The fork's shadow, just to the right
  of the utensils, recalls a hand, with fingers closed. The well of the
  spoon intersects the bottom edge of the rectangle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we consider the function of the spoon and fork, we should note that
the lower edge of the canvas is unpainted, reminding us that painterly
illusionism is not in order. And right above this unpainted lower strip,
we read the stencilled letters of the painting's title "IN MEMORY OF
MY FEELINGS--FRANK O'HARA" and, to its right, the signature "J. JOHNS"
with the date "[19]61." This seeming authentication is misleading, for
the painting in no way "illustrates" O'Hara's poem, of which more in a
moment. Indeed, as Fred Orton puts it, <B></B>

the grey brushstrokes that dominate the right, and mark the white
ground and turpentine-like-brown greyness of the left canvas are
there not as the direct expression of feelings but as signifiers of
the expression of feelings appropriated from the pictorial language of
abstract expressionism. In the context of Johns's surface, they refer
to the idea of the unmediated association of feelings and facture, but
their very identity as appropriated signifiers inhibits our seeing and
understanding them as marks directly expressive of Johns's feelings.

Brushstroke thus becomes ironic allusion, a kind of distancing device
whereby overt emotion, whether the painter's own or that of the previous
New York generation, is kept at bay. The suspended spoon and fork
contribute to this sense of displacement. Orton speculates that Johns
had in mind O'Hara's poem "Dig My Grave with a Silver Spoon," and that
there is some private association between these little eating utensils
and death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 But perhaps the most important thing to note is that Johns strips
 ordinary domestic objects like spoons of their normal associations,
 recontextualizing them so as to "make it strange." Spoons and forks are
 to eat with, not suspended from wires like stick res in a game of
 Hang Man. Spoons and forks are to be held by someone, one in each hand,
 not bound together as they are here, where the fork oddly hides behind
 (or couples with?) the suspended, phallically erect spoon (<I>FOH</I>
 xxii). And finally, the juxtaposition of these ordinary, everyday objects
 with the bluish-gray paint surface is curiously disorienting, challenging
 the viewer's notions of how a visual field should be organized.

The blue-black brushstrokes play yet another role: they almost bury the
words "DEAD MAN" stenciled across the lower edge of both canvases: "D"

  own devising, in the top right of the canvas." The naked eye cannot
  make out this skull; Orton is presumably drawing on Johns's sketchbook

The reference to "DEAD MAN" appears curiously prophetic as O'Hara met
his own death five years later, when he was only forty, in a tragic
beach buggy accident at Fire Island. The commemorative volume published
by the Museum of Modern Art in 1967 again bore the title <I>In Memory
of My Feelings.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  But in 1961 O'Hara was very much alive, so the words "DEAD MAN" and
  the outline of the hidden skull must be construed otherwise. A hint is
  supplied in John Cage's collage essay "Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas,"
  first published in the Jewish Museum catalog of the work of Johns early
  in 1964 and reprinted in <I>A Year From Monday</I> . In this text,
  in which the italicized passages are taken from Johns's own writings,
  Cage tries to recreate the artist's strange but highly disciplined ways
  of working and to define his aesthetic. Near the beginning, we read:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Beginning with a flag that has no space around it, that has the same
size as the painting, we see that it is not a painting <I>of</I> a
flag. The roles are reversed: beginning with the flag, a painting was
made. Beginning, that is, with structure. [<I>YM</I> 74]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But not just any structure: "If it comes to his notice that someone else
had one of his ideas before he did, he makes a mental or actual note not
to proceed with his plan" (ibid.). Here is the fear of "resemblances"
I talked of earlier, the need to See It New. And also the need to
differentiate Johns from his contemporaries: "if only," notes Cage,
discrimination "will make us pause long enough in our headstrong passage
through history to realize that Pop Art, if deducted from his work,
represents a misunderstanding, if embarked upon as the next step after
his, represents a non-sequitur" (<I>YM</I> 75). And we recall Johns's
own distinction between Pop Art's "dealing with images" and his own
"working for form" (<I>WSI</I> 92).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gay "concealment," it seems, can mean many different things: witness
the obsession with object and image of that other famous gay sixties
artist, Andy Warhol. For Johns, perhaps because of the rootlessness and
isolation of his childhood, subjectivity becomes a matter of endless
self-invention. In Cage's wonderfully dead-pan "bio" sketch:

He does not remember being born. His earliest memories concern living with
his grandparents in Allendale, South Carolina. Later, in the same town, he

went back to live with his grandparents. After the third grade in school
he went to Columbia, which seemed like a big city, to live with his mother
and stepfather. A year later, school finished, he went to a community
on a lake called The Corner to stay with his Aunt Gladys. He thought
it was for the summer but stayed there for six years studying with his
aunt who taught all the grades in one room, a school called Climax. The
following year he finished high school living in Sumter with his mother

for a year and a half in Columbia where he lived alone. [<I>YM</I> 78]

How do we interpret these "facts"? There is no simple answer. We may
surmise, if we like, that Johns must have been lonely and miserable. But
this would be to read normative values into the equivocal portrait,
whereas it might just be possible, in Johns's particular case, that the
absence of close family ties and a home produced a remark

able self-reliance and resilience. Then, too, as Cage implies, there is,
after all, one constant in the nomadic life described--namely, South
Carolina, represented, in the present of Cage's essay, by Edisto.

   A few pages later, Cage poses the question, "Does he live in the same
   terror and confusion that we do?" And he responds in Johns's own words,
   "<I>The air must move in as well as out--no sadness, just disaster</I>"
   (<I>YM</I> 80). This Buddhist note of acceptance (a faith Cage shares
   and hence writes about so movingly) culminates in the text's final
   paragraph, which refers to an afternoon of mushroom hunting in the
   local woods:

Even though in those Edisto woods you think you didn't get a tick or

make a conscientious self-examination with a mirror if necessary. It
would be silly too to stay out of the woods simply because the ticks are
in them. Think of the mushrooms (Caesar's among them!) that would have
been missed. Ticks removed, fresh clothes put on, something to drink,
something to eat, you revive. There's scrabble and now chess to play

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
O'Hara's long autobiographical poem was begun on his thirtieth birthday;
the immediate occasion may well have been the crisis of turning thirty
and fearing that his vocation might never be realized. Indeed, as Bill
Berkson speculates, the poem's sense of urgency may well have to do with
the publication, that same year , of another long poem by a friend
of the very same age--<I>Howl</I> by Allen Ginsberg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  "In Memory of My Feelings" opens as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The crisis O'Hara presents so movingly here is that of objectification
by the other. At the outset, the poet's "naked selves" are endlessly
victimized and terrorized: "A gun is

<B></B>

'fired,'" and "pink flamingoes" absurdly crush "one of me" "underneath
their hooves," leaving behind "terror in earth, dried mushrooms,
pink feathers, tickets" (<I>CP</I> 253). A little further along, "My
transparent selves / flail about like vipers in a pail, writhing and
hissing / without panic" (ibid.). Indeed, memory only increases the pain
and humiliation: "My father, my uncle, my grand-uncle and the several
aunts"--these become nothing less than "the dead hunting" the "alive,
ahunted" (ibid.). The poet's mind, trying to deal with these memories
of victimization is "like a shuttered suite in the Grand Hotel / where
mail arrives for my incognito, / whose fa&ccedil;ade has been slipping
into the Grand Canal for centuries" (<I>CP</I> 254).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This last passage is characterized by the "performative fluency" that Katz
speaks of, the campy power to construct alternate identities that allow
one to survive. In the gay poetry of the sixties, a central strategy is
humor: for much of this poem, O'Hara's narrator is able to laugh at his
past exploits and at "the occasion of these ruses" (<I>CP</I> 257). Many
of the "memories," moreover, far from being actual recollections, are
based on various Hollywood films, as in the comic passage about Lord
Nelson, where the "meek subaltern writhes in his bedclothes / with the
fury of a thousand, violating an insane mistress / who has only herself
to offer his multitudes" (<I>CP</I> 255). The resort to imaginary memories
that are actually quotations from other works, thus distancing the reader
from the poet's inner turmoil, distinguishes O'Hara from the Confessional
poets of the fifties and sixties. "Personism," as O'Hara conceives of it,
is not "personalism."

It is a brilliant performance but one that cannot last. The fifth and
final section opens with the short line "And now it is the serpent's turn"
(<I>CP</I> 256). How to reconcile the phallic serpent to "the heart /
that bubbles with red ghosts, since to move is to love"? Fantasies of
domination give way to a reprise of erotic/masochistic dreams, whether of
"being shot / by a guerrilla warrior or dumped from a car into ferns,"
or a

moment in which "The hero, trying to unhitch his parachute / stumbles
over me. It is our last embrace" (ibid.). "The fancy," in Keats's words,
"cannot cheat so well / As she is fam'd to do." Hence the poignancy and
pathos of the poem's ending:

There is much more to be said about this complex poem, but here I want
to focus on its relationship to Johns's painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  In both cases, meaning is created by juxtaposition of unlike items
  in an intricate network of metonymic images. In the poem, for
  example, the various unrelated scenes of hunting and war--whether
  remembered incidents or allusions to World War II films, or even pure
  inventions--play on the fear and paranoia of the poet, or again, the
  great-aunt's "blood vessels [that] rushed to the surface / and burst
  like rockets," can be related to the Grand Canal scene in Venice,
  where "rockets splay over a <I>sposalizio</I>" (<I>CP</I> 254),
  and then to the "fury of a thousand" in the Lord Nelson scene. In
  the same vein, while the painting has no focus or vanishing point,
  no re silhouetted against a ground, no symmetry between left and
  right halves, the shape of the spoon handle is metonymically related to
  paint shapes throughout, and the brushstrokes, as I have already noted,
  create structures of great intricacy. Or again, in <I>Watchman,</I>
  the little red stick at bottom left echoes the line of the chair back
  in the upper right, even as the black and white strip with its drips
  at the bottom of the frame carries on the rhythm of the vertical strip
  above it to create a T-shape. Each part of the canvas is as important
  as every other part, the principle being, again in Stein's words,
  "use everything."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both poem and painting create tension between formal abstraction and the
introduction of ordinary, everyday objects. "My quietness has a man in
it," gives way to the particularism of O'Hara's absurdist catalogues,
even as Johns's painting projects the suspended spoon and fork against a
backdrop of thick and separate brushstrokes. The curious tension between
the abstract and the "real" also produces a marked eroticism. In a comic
allusion to Whitman's <I>Leaves of Grass,</I> O'Hara's

But what about Johns's hidden "DEAD MAN"? How does this reference
relate to the "man" in O'Hara's first line--"My quietness has a man
in it"--or to those later multiple "selves" who must, in the end, be
"killed" so as to "save the serpent in their midst"? It is in their
treatment of death that O'Hara and Johns part company. O'Hara is still
very much a post-Romantic poet, yearning for presence, for a particular
palpable self that is anchored in a particular body. However much his
"I" clowns around, playing self-deprecating games with what Katz calls
"performative fluency," however much he can laugh at his own past
and present inadequacies and postures, the driving force of the poem
is <I>anxiety</I> (which is also the title of one of his most moving
poems--see <I>CP</I> 268), a free-floating fear whose ultimate object,
death, is never far away, as in "A Step Away from Them," where not even
the "beautiful and warm" avenue can dispel the thought that "First /
Bunny died, then John Latouche, / then Jackson Pollock," or as in the
last two lines of "Music," where the poet's buoyant mood is dispelled
by the thought, "But no more fountains and no more rain / And the stores
stay open terribly late" (<I>CP</I> 258, 210). O'Hara's most famous poem,
let's remember, is the elegy "The Day Lady Died."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For O'Hara, death and petrifaction (as in the Medusa's stare in
"In Memory") are omnipresent, threatening at every moment to destroy
the fragile self. Evidently, Johns recognized this vulnerability: in
<I>In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara,</I> he writes "A DEAD MAN"
in big block letters, only to "<I>cover it with paint. Rub it against
canvas. Skull against canvas.</I>" John Cage, visiting Johns in Edisto
Beach, where the latter had evidently undergone a bout of depression,
catches this mood perfectly in <I>Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Contemplating Johns's map and flag paintings, Cage remarks, "Stupidly
  we think of abstract expressionism. But here we are free of struggle,
  gesture, and personal image. Looking closely helps, though the paint
  is applied so sensually that there is the danger of falling in love"
  (<I>YM</I> 83). This subtle distinction between personal gesture and
  the sensuality of the paint itself refers obliquely to the distinction
  between the gesture painting (or gesture poetry) of the fifties and
  the more conceptual art of the sixties (his present in the essay),
  when the erotic became, so to speak, a source of ideation rather than
  personal image. Indeed, to come back to the title, unlike O'Hara's
  memory of his feelings, Johns's "memory" is not of former "feelings"
  or the specific incidents, real and imaginary, that generated those
  feelings; the memory, rather, is of his earlier art works: flags,
  canvases, numbers, letters, targets. It is this particular continuity
  that gives comfort.

Cage, who declares himself somewhat intimidated by the "enigmatic aura
of his [Johns's] personality," understands this perfectly (<I>YM</I>
73). "<I>A Dead Man,</I>" he knows, could be used as well as anything
else to give life to a given painting: "<I>Take a skull. Cover it with
paint. Rub it against canvas.</I>" The shape of a skull, as Johns depicts
it, is not, after all, all that different from a light bulb. Indeed, the
skull-rubbing exercise was soon to be taken quite literally. In May of
1962, Johns made <I>Study for Skin,</I> a series of four drawings made by
pressing the artist's lubricated face on paper and then rubbing charcoal
on the paper to render the oiled surface visible. The resulting images
are strangely indeterminate. On the one hand, we can see them, especially
No. 1 (<A HREF="8.2perloff_0.html"> 10</A>), as images of an
eyeless face, flanked by hands spread on a pane of glass, behind which

<B></B>

the man to whom they belong is somehow trapped. On the other, they
are, in Cage's words, "Structures, not subjects" in their successive
transformation of recognizable object into abstract form (<I>YM</I>
75). "He sometimes," says Cage, "introduces signs of humanity to intimate
that we, not birds for instance, are part of the dialogue. . . . Finally,
with nothing in it to grasp, the work is weather, an atmosphere that is
heavy rather than light . . . in oscillation with it we tend toward our
ultimate place: zero, gray disinterest" (<I>YM</I> 76). The "scene of
my selves," to use O'Hara's phrase, is gradually occluded.

The poem, dated 11 July 1963, belongs to O'Hara's final years and is as
dark as anything he wrote. Even its lines trail off inconclusively, one
line never quite anticipating the placement of the following. The poet
who had always celebrated change, motion, vitality, and openness, here
cannot get beyond his obsessive death thoughts. Like Johns's charcoal
"skin" rubbings, the clouds are said to "go soft"--an absurd remark
since clouds are soft by definition, constantly change color, and
inevitably sink, whether, as here, into the sea or behind mountains,
trees, or buildings. The references to the moon launch and Sputnik
in lines 5-11 only serve to intensify the poet's own isolation:
"Sputnik," after all, means "travelling companion," wryly suggesting,
in an echo of Philip Sidney's famous sonnet "With how sad steps, oh
moon . . .", that even in outer space there must be more companionship
than here on earth. Down here, even as the years tick off inexorably
("the shirts change, endless procession"), everything remains the same
("they are all neck 14 sleeve 33"), the armholes imperceptibly turning
into graves. "No more conversion, no more conversation": nothing but the
"zero, gray disinterest" Cage discerns with reference to Johns's drawings.

The last two lines of "The Clouds Go Soft" are especially arresting. Here
it is not, in the words of the popular song, smoke that "gets in your eye"
but sand that "inevitably seeks" it. Smoke is ephemeral whereas sand can
cause permanent damage to the eye. And yet O'Hara's reference is also an
in-joke, an allusion to the actual sand at Edisto beach. Just a few months
earlier, in a letter-poem called "Dear Jap," O'Hara had written, "When
I think of you in South Carolina I think of my foot in the sand." The
reference is to Johns's <I>Memory Piece</I> (<I>Frank O'Hara</I>) begun
in 1961 (<A HREF="8.2perloff_2.html"> 12</A>), made by

Barely legible in the visual field of Johns's <I>Skin with O'Hara
Poem,</I> "The Clouds Go Soft," is thus an apt analogue to the composition
of body fragments--helpless, extended hands, palms against an invisible
surface, flanking a smudged black facial contour, rather like an image
of the Crucifixion or perhaps Veronica's Napkin--in the lithograph. But
why did poet and painter never complete the originally projected
portfolio of collaborations, of which <I>Skin</I> turned out to be the
only exemplar? My guess is that the personal anguish expressed in this
and related O'Hara poems of 1963 was one that Johns, having undergone a
similar personal crisis, had schooled himself, probably with Cage's help,
to submit to the discipline of formal structuration, thus depersonalizing
the visual field.

  <I>Skin</I> is a bleak, unsettling picture, but the source of pain is
  not specified: it might relate to war as readily as to the sorrows
  of lost love. "I'm interested," as Johns was at pains to tell David
  Sylvester shortly after exhibiting <I>Skin,</I> "in things which
  suggest the world rather than suggest the personality" (<I>WSI</I> 113).

By 1964, in any case, Johns was spending more time than ever with Cage,
Cunningham, and David Tudor. In March, en route to Hawaii and Japan, he
traveled with Lois Long and Cage to San Francisco, where Cage performed
with Tudor at the San Francisco Tape Music Center. It was at one of their
performances that Johns noticed the spot of light on the ceiling--a
reflection from the mirror in a woman's compact--that gave him the
idea for the reflective light he was to use shortly in the painting
<I>Souvenir 2</I> (<A HREF="8.2perloff_3.html"> 13</A>)--a
painting that incorporates a penny arcade self-portrait placed on cheap
souvenir plate. After vacationing with Cage and some others in Hawaii
in April, Johns left for Tokyo, where he painted <I>Watchman.</I> A new
phase had begun.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the notebook sketch for the painting, let's recall, Johns distinguishes
between a watchman who "falls 'into' the 'trap' of looking" and a spy
who "must be ready to 'move' must be aware / Of his entrances &amp;
exits." The watchman "leaves / his job &amp; takes away / no information,"
whereas the spy "must remember / &amp; must remember himself &amp;
his remembering." And further: whereas "The spy designs himself to be
overlooked," "the watchman 'serves' as a warning." But a warning of
what? Perhaps that the poetry of immediate presence of a Frank O'Hara,
especially fetching and brilliant as it was in those poems of the late
fifties like "Why I Am Not a Painter" or "Khrushchev is coming on the
right day!" was no longer sufficient: "The spy stations himself / to
observe the / watchman." Indeed, one way to understand such Johns works
as <I>In Memory of My Feelings--Frank O'Hara, Skin with O'Hara Poem,</I>
and <I>Watchman,</I> is as covert critique of O'Hara's "Personism,"
with its potential "fall 'into' the 'trap' of looking" and its "tak[ing]
away" of "no information."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  Against this particular posture, this "occasion of my ruses,"
  Johns puts forward a "cool" Conceptualism that takes the mode of
  the painter's earlier Flags, Targets, Numbers, and Alphabets to its
  logical conclusion. But "cool" is of course itself a cover: the very
  absence of "personal" references or images of human life is itself a
  sign of pathos. And what could be more "emotional" than the sense of
  disjunction and mismatch (of letters with colors, and so on) displayed
  in paintings like <I>Watchman</I>?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Does the "information" Johns speaks of relate to McCarthyite surveillance
and the Cold War discourse of spying, as Roth thinks? Perhaps these
notions are subliminally present. In a larger sense, however, the
distinction is one between <I>warm</I> and <I>cool,</I> between the
gestural expressivity of the second-generation New York painters and
poets of the late 1950s, and the more ideational, philosophical, and
distanced art that inevitably came into being (whether consciously
or not) in response to the political climate of the sixties. For the
autobiographical "imprint" found in such poems as "Joe's Jacket," Johns
substitutes the rubber imprint of O'Hara's actual--but in the context,
wholly anonymous--foot. Were it not for the title <I>Memory Piece [Frank
O'Hara]</I>, the viewer of Johns's box construction could not possibly
identify this foot's owner. "The spy," remember, "designs himself
to be overlooked." Thus, in the ambitious <I>According to What,</I>
painted later in 1964, the self- portrait of <I>Souvenir</I> has been
painted over and replaced by the work's title, even as the painting itself
contains oblique references to all of Johns's earlier work, specifically,
the leg and chair, hinged canvas, sign letters, color chart, newspaper,
coat hanger and spoon, the primary color abstraction and tonal scale.

Accordingly, when Johns becomes the director of the Merce Cunningham
Dance Company in 1965, he "designs" scenery that involves no painting

part at all, but is, on the contrary, a conceptual set based on
Duchamp's <I>Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare of Her Bachelors,

<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

The resulting dance piece, <I>Walkaround Time</I> , was not

all of your traffic had to be lateral from one wing to the other."

  can play in the process of "stationing [one]self to observe the

But O'Hara's good humored and self-deprecating gesture of tolerance
becomes, in Johns's own writing, a pressing metaphysical question. And
such questions, themselves inevitably political in their implications,
proved central to the "new art" and "new poetry" of the sixties and to
their legacy to the increasingly pervasive Conceptualism of the nineties.

There are various ways to improve one's chess game. One is to take back
a move when it becomes clear that it was a bad one. Another is to accept
the consequences, devastating as they are. Johns chooses the latter even
when the former is offered. Say he has a disagreement with others; he
examines the situation and comes to a moral decision. He then proceeds,
if to an impasse, to an impasse. When all else fails (and he has taken
the precaution of being prepared in case it does), he makes a work of
art devoid of complaint. [<I>YM</I> 74]

A work of art <I>devoid of complaint.</I> "A painting," as Cage interprets
Johns, "is not a record of what was said and what the replies were
but the thick presence all at once of a naked self-obscuring body of
history" (<I>YM</I> 79). The personal now becomes inseparable from the
political. "The spy," let's remember, "must be ready to 'move,' must be
aware of his entrances &amp; exits." In this way, what was perceived by
contemporaries as indifference can now be understood as an oblique but
necessary form of intervention. In Johns's words, "Take an object. Do
something to it. Do something else to it" (<I>WSI</I> 54).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When is power foreign? Is it only so in colonies, penal or otherwise,
or is it always somehow the case? Do we accept authority more readily
when its foundations evade our comprehension, when something other than
reason encourages us to submit? And if, indeed, it is the Law's startling
senselessness that compels us to accept official meanings, does not this
dimension also open the way to unexpected appropriations? The failure of
sense may well lead to the making of sense--and yet, could this failure
not provide a point of convergence that would lead not to subjection
but to the reproduction of alternative social worlds?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Franz Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" invites such speculation. A traveler,
an explorer from a distant land, visits a penal colony where he is invited
to witness an execution. The officer in charge of the maintenance and
enforcement of judicial matters shows him the lethal apparatus, which
inscribes the violated commandment on the condemned man's flesh. A
soldier, the only other person in attendance, straps the condemned man
to the apparatus. The execution is about to begin, when the condemned man
vomits, sickened perhaps by the sweets fed to him by the new commander's
ladies, perhaps by the repulsive felt stump placed in his mouth to prevent
him from screaming. The mishap drives the officer to a tirade in which he
begs the traveler to help him defend this system of justice. The traveler
refuses; although he is touched by the officer's devotion, he finds the
procedure inhumane; if anything, the officer's appeal persuades him that
he has the influence to intervene. The traveler's unwillingness to

<B></B>

defend the apparatus compels the officer to make a fateful
decision. Having freed the prisoner and readjusted the machine to
inscribe his own judgment--"Be just"--the officer removes his clothing;
the condemned man and the soldier strap him down; and the machine silently
starts working. But then, quite literally, things fall apart, and the
exquisite torture the officer desired is reduced to "full-blown murder."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  After burying the officer and visiting the Old Commandant's grave,
  the traveler leaves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story suggests--even insists upon--the foreign character of
power. Agents of justice are recognized as possessing qualities that place
them at a remove from local politics, from the realm of comprehensible
meanings, from conscious thought, from life itself. Take the protagonist,
"a great researcher of Western Civilization" (at least to some) whose
refusal to endorse the officer's position leads directly to the latter's
self-righteous self-condemnation. He is a foreigner of a classically
anthropological, even imperial sort: he visits, he observes, he refrains
from intervening. Assuming neutrality gives him all the more authority to
transform local practices. He is not unlike the high colonial reformers
of the period, who stood in judgment of the humanity of native customs
that their predecessors had preserved or, more commonly, invented.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Even the most soft-spoken commentary will provide ammunition for those
  who wish to defend the traditional system or consign it to the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then there is the system itself and the apparatus that instantiates
it, the work of the dead commander. Where the traveler is foreign in
relation to the penal colony as a whole, the judicial system is foreign
in relation to the condemned. The condemned man has not had a chance
to defend himself; he does not even know that he has been accused. The
officer explains the procedure in French, a language the condemned man
"presumably" does not understand ("IPC" 194). An encounter with a foreign
tongue always foregrounds the problematically material character of
social discourse--the qualities that make language something more (and
less) than a vehicle for communicating ideas. The apparatus that is used
to carry out the sentence also brings these material qualities to the
fore. The apparatus is textual in multiple senses. It works by writing
an elaborated script that can only be "read" through the body. Beginning
with the skin--an intimate interface between an interior and the outside
world--the condemned man's flesh is the focus of the justice served. One
also gauges the effects of the procedure by reading a surface: the
"glow" that radiates from the dying man's face. Through writing,
the apparatus accomplishes a work of abstraction, extending a process
across multiple contexts. It functions in the same fashion every time,
following a schedule that runs from inscription to enlightenment at that
sixth hour when "even the stupidest man" deciphers the command ("IPC"
205). But at the same time that the machine leaves traces on bodies,
bodies leave traces on the machine. Numerous details evoke what is
missing--from the cane chairs that surround the apparatus to the felt
stump, rank with the saliva of dying men.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Presumably neither the soldier nor the condemned man understood French,"
Kafka writes. "It was therefore all the more striking that the condemned
man nevertheless made an effort to follow the officer's explanations"
("IPC" 194). On the levels of citizenship, language, and textuality,
"In the Penal Colony" presents the alien character of

<B></B>

power as a source of fascination and force. But the narrative
simultaneously reveals how this might be translated as a source of
vulnerability. It is this aspect of Kafka's story that I wish to bring
to bear on a particular postcolonial setting. First, however, I want to
create a context for my analysis by reflecting on one influential effort
to use Kafka's corpus to shed light on ideology and the Law.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

A Singular Apparatus

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka exaggerates nothing. So asserts Slavoj Zizek midway
through "How did Marx Invent the Symptom," an essay that explores the
implications for the analysis of ideology of a peculiar convergence of
psychoanalysis and Marxist thought. Starting with the Lacanian observation
that Marx invented the symptom, Zizek explores the ways in
which ideology works on the level of practice as an "unconscious illusion"
that structures "our real, effective relationship to reality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  What Kafka shows us is not a "fantasy image of social reality,"
  but, on the contrary, the "<I>mise en scene</I> of the fantasy
  which is at work in the midst of social reality itself" ("HDM"
  36).  Zizek continues, "we all know very well that the
  bureaucracy is not all-powerful, but our 'effective' conduct in the
  presence of bureaucratic machinery is already regulated by a belief
  in its almightiness" (ibid.). However we may comment on our actions,
  in the rituals of everyday life we act as if certain beliefs about
  value and authority were true.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Zizek uses Kafka's writings to illustrate Pascal's dictum
 on the "automatism" of belief: "Custom is the whole of equity for the
 sole reason that it is accepted" ("HDM" 37). According to his account,
 the circular assertion reveals the "constitutively senseless character of
 the Law" (ibid.). We obey the Law not because it is good or beneficial,
 but simply because it is the Law; rather than its virtues leading to
 obedience, obedience brings its virtues to light. The incomprehensible,
 traumatic character of the Law is what sustains its authority. But
 Zizek does not simply make Kafka into an illustrator
 of Pascal's theory of belief; he also marshals him as a critic of
 Althusser. According to this reading, Althusser failed to integrate
 his portrait of the materiality of ideology with his account of the
 interpellation of subjects. In the "little theoretical theater" used
 to showcase the workings of "ideological state apparatuses," Althusser
 failed to pay heed, as it were, to what happens in the split second
 between when the policeman yells and the subject turns around.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Althusser speaks only of the process of ideological interpellation,
through which the symbolic machine of ideology is "internalized"
into the ideological experience of Meaning and Truth: but we learn
from Pascal that this "internalization," by structural necessity,
never fully succeeds, that there is always a residue, a leftover,
a stain of traumatic irrationality and senselessness sticking to it,
and that <I>this leftover, far from hindering the full submission of
the subject to the ideological command, is the very condition of it.</I>
["HDM" 43-4; emphasis in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka develops a "kind of criticism of Althusser <I>avant la lettre</I>
in letting us see that which is constitutive of the gap between the
'machine' and its 'internalization'" ("HDM" 44). 

<B></B>

Kafka's novels begin with a hailing of sorts, in which the
protagonist is called by a "mysterious bureaucratic entity." The result of
the summons is not subjectivation; try as they might, Kafka's characters
can find nothing in the Other with which to identify, for the meaning of
the call remains obscure. Kafka thus offers a vision of a constitutive
moment in the working of ideology. In everyday life, the experience of
the apparatus as alien paradoxically leads to an identification with
it. A form of transference results, with the "supposition of a Truth,
of a Meaning behind the stupid, traumatic, inconsistent fact of the Law"
("HOM" 38). Ideology allows us to escape the traumatic dimension of
the Law by offering us social reality as an alternative. We come to see
ourselves in its terms in order to domesticate the shock with which the
ideological Other confronts us.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Zizek does not mention "In the Penal Colony" in his
discussions of Kafka. Still, it is possible to read the story through
the lens that he provides. Elsewhere he shows how two sections of <I>The
Trial</I> can be read as transformations of one another. In the first,
the priest's parable of the doorkeeper who stands "before the law,"
the Law is inaccessible; the subject only glimpses its radiance as
he is dying. In the second, which describes the protagonist's arrival
for his first interrogation by the Court, the Law is all too present
"in the guise of various obscene, nauseous phenomena."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In fact, Zizek contends, the two perspectives implicate
  one another: "in so far as the law is not grounded in truth, it
  is impregnated with enjoyment" ("OOP" 151). "In the Penal Colony"
  stages two similar perspectives. The officer's explanation of the
  apparatus, like the priest's parable, describes a carefully calibrated
  passage toward the deathly moment when the Law is briefly revealed. In
  Zizek's model, the Law is senseless here because it remains
  incomplete; its truth, like the Old Commandant's, is missing. But the
  Law is equally senseless where it is inconsistent; it appears as a
  "bricolage," "smeared with an obscene vitality" ("OOP" 149). For
  the condemned man and soldier, the apparatus is a site of unseemly
  pleasure. While the officer is petitioning the traveler to advocate
  for his procedure, the soldier and the condemned man are devouring rice
  porridge. After the officer takes the formerly condemned man's place,
  the condemned man puts on filthy, torn clothing and entertains the
  soldier by cavorting around. The two men proceed to t over the
  ladies' handkerchiefs, chase the gears from the apparatus, and amuse
  themselves with the detritus from the machine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sympathizing with the officer--in whose place he claims he "would
have acted no differently"--the traveler is "annoyed" by the sight of
the recently released condemned man happily mimicking the officer's
explanation of the apparatus ("IPC" 224). In his aversion, one finds not
only a typical colonial disdain for native imitation, but one also sees
evidence of how the traveler's intervention fails.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Recall the elements that the officer had unsuccessfully tried to
  eliminate from his predecessor's judicial system: the lies of the
  accused, the sweets from the ladies, fingerprints on the drawings,
  vomit in the works. In his intervention, the traveler himself
  tries to eliminate similar contingencies on behalf of "humanity" as
  an ideal. It is as if the plot were designed to teach the traveler
  Pascal's dictum. He wishes to make the legal system more rational;
  and yet his influences simply reproduces its pleasures and restages
  its mysteries, without providing

<B></B>

the enlightenment that both he and the officer desired. The inscription
on the Old Commandant's tomb seems to capture a sense of this enduring
dilemma. The Old Commandant <I>will</I> always be resurrected: in the
form of the constitutive senselessness of the Law. From this perspective,
the traveler's harried departure follows the logic Zizek
outlines: he flees the traumatic <I>mise en sc&egrave;ne,</I> like
someone waking from a dream.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reading of "In the Penal Colony" is compelling. Yet it fails to take
fully into account certain possibilities opened by Zizek's
observations on the alien character of the Law. If one carefully
follows  Zizek's argument that the Law's efficacy does not
rest on the communication of a singular truth, it becomes possible to
imagine a setting in which more than one form of transference could
result from the trauma of an encounter with the apparatus of the Penal
Colony. To get a sense of the instability of this situation, it is worth
reconsidering the traveler's reactions to those characters who "presumably
do not speak French." A crucial dimension of the story consists in the
traveler's effort to interpret the condemned man's own interpretation
of the situation. Assumptions about what the condemned man does not know
motivate his decision to intervene. Yet his interpretations are fraught
with uncertainty. The narrative tells us only what the other characters
appear to say or think; the prose is scattered with the expressions,
"seems" and "as if." The faces of the other characters often refract
a peculiar knowledge, as when the condemned man's stare seems to
ask the traveler "whether he approved of the described procedure"
("IPC" 198). This uncertainty intensifies after the soldier and the
traveler exchange words at the end of the narrative. After reading
the inscription, the traveler rises to look at the faces of the men
who frequent the teahouse. They are described as "smiling as if they
had read the inscription with him, had found it ridiculous, and were
asking him to concur in their opinion" ("IPC" 228). But is this the only
possibility that the traveler "pretends not to notice" when he heads for
the port? Among those who frequent the teahouse are said to be the Old
Commandant's anonymous supporters; in the teahouse the soldier and the
condemned man have both found acquaintances; could there be something
more than obscenity--some inscrutable meaning--that the traveler feels
compelled to flee? We can read "In the Penal Colony" as an illustration
of  Zizek's observations. But are we looking for the Law
when we should be looking for laws? Kafka's story shows us how power's
very alterity can lead to its subversion; the apparatus may not be so
"singular" after all. I would now like to turn to an ethnographic
situation where the possibilities hinted at in the story come more
clearly into view.

Raiding Jakarta

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The province of Irian Jaya has long occupied a problematic place in the
vast island nation-state of Indonesia. Comprising the western half of
the island of New Guinea, which was claimed by the Netherlands Indies
in 1848, the territory lay for many years just beyond the limits of
effective colonial rule. For complicated reasons, when the rest of the
Indies gained independence, the Netherlands retained western New Guinea
as a separate colony, ostensibly to prepare its primitive inhabitants
for self-rule. Justified 

<B></B>

by the racial and cultural differences that supposedly divided New Guinea's
 "Papuans" from the rest of the Indies' natives, this post-war colonial
 adventure ended in 1963, when first the United Nations, and then
 Indonesia took control of the territory. In 1969, with the military
 suppressing all dissent, one thousand carefully selected tribal leaders
 unsurprisingly chose integration into Indonesia over independence. So
 western New Guinea became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, and
 the Papuans became the Irianese.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A Papuan nationalist movement waxed and waned under the so-called New
Order regime, whose leader, President Suharto, ruled Indonesia from 1965
to 1998 through a combination of patronage, terror, and manufactured
consent. To suppress the separatists, the military engaged in horrific
acts of violence. But by the early 1990s, the government was shifting
away from the "security" approach, with the launching of projects
designed to develop the "backward" Irianese. In the off-shore regency
of Biak-Numfor, where I did fieldwork, the new strategy seemed to be
working. State-sponsored schools educated the islands' inhabitants in the
national curriculum and language, in which rates of literacy had long been
high. Village and city dwellers dealt with and worked for the military and
civil service, and were fluent in official rhetorics of rule. Those with
access to television consumed the same state-sponsored fare as viewers a
thousand miles away. In the near future, Biak would become increasingly
accessible to outsiders, with the opening of a resort that would take
advantage of the islands' position on the flight path between Los Angeles
and Bali. Although the regency had been the site of resistance in earlier
times, the relatively well-educated, cosmopolitan population seemed ready,
even eager, to enter the ranks of Indonesian citizens. One sign of the
regime's confidence was the very fact of my research in a province where
anthropologists unaffiliated with the government or missions had been
unable to do fieldwork for nearly thirty years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But there may have been more to the islanders' submission than met the
eye. Through a dynamic I have elsewhere called the fetishization of the
foreign, the very practices through which Biaks signaled their acceptance
of New Order identities prove legible from a different point of view.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  This dynamic resided on various levels, beginning with the vocabulary
  with which people discussed successful persons. Parents spoke of
  their efforts to turn their children into "foreigners"--a Biak word,
  <I>amber,</I> which covered a field of reference including non-Irianese
  Indonesians, Westerners, Biak civil servants and respected persons
  more generally. One became a foreigner by virtue of one's origins
  or experience in the Land of the Foreigners, an imagined space that
  included sites as disparate as the provincial bureaucracy, the local
  port and market, Jakarta, the Netherlands, and Japan. Local foreigners
  provided evidence of their privileged access to such spaces through
  practices ranging from the exchanges that accompanied marriage,
  to the speeches given by local historians, to the songs sung by
  expert composers. These genres of social action both presupposed and
  reproduced a representation of the Land of the Foreigners as the source
  of pleasurable surprises, inexpressible meanings, and inexhaustible
  goods. When families participated in wedding processions that treated
  the market as a source of foreign booty, when ministers gave 

<B></B>

sermons that treated the Bible as a source of unfathomable truths, the very
effort to capture foreignness served to recreate it in the fetishistic
fashion inherent in the fact that to name the alien is to domesticate
it as such. Applied in settings associated with the Indonesian state,
this logic enabled Biaks to participate in national rituals without
accepting the identities they would seem to promote.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For an example of this deflection of national identity, consider the
trip to Jakarta I took with fifteen Biak singers in 1993.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  As part of the effort to promote tourism in Irian Jaya, the government
  was working to domesticate the threatening differences that once
  justified western New Guinea's separation from Indonesia. The goal
  was to incorporate Irian Jaya into the collection of equivalent
  cultural units to which the national slogan, "Unity in Diversity,"
  referred. Through official programs designed to identify and salvage
  "appropriate" local traditions, Irian Jaya would develop its own
  provincial house, wedding costume, and welcome dance. It was in this
  spirit that the Biak singers, aging experts in a once popular song
  form called <I>wor,</I> received an invitation to participate in a
  national festival of oral traditions. Including visits to monuments
  and a theme park, "Beautiful Indonesia in Miniature," the trip took the
  form of a national pilgrimage. Not least of all, the festival gave the
  singers a chance to present Irian Jaya's share of "Unity in Diversity"
  in the newspapers and on television, as well as on stage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was ironic that <I>wor</I> was selected for the honor, given the
form's history. Suppressed by the missionaries who settled on Biak
in the early twentieth century, <I>wor</I> was performed during the
millennial uprisings that occurred on Biak during the colonial period,
and by the Papuan separatists who took shelter in Biak's forests during
the 1970s. While the authorities seemed oblivious to the political
associations of the genre, the singers I knew viewed it as a potent
and dangerous tool. Then there was the matter of its form. <I>Wor</I>
songs provided a paradigmatic example of how Biak performers registered
the foreignness of experiences that might otherwise have seemed banal. I
was told that every song originated with a surprise; something startling
happened to a composer and a song simply popped into his or her head. The
composer repeated the surprise in the riddling structure of the lyrics,
with the first half of the song missing words that the second half
filled in. The <I>wor</I> experts I knew were very well acquainted with
airplanes, American tourists, and visiting officials. Nevertheless, their
songs on these topics had the effect of presenting everyday encounters
as unprecedented: as experiences that came as a shock.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given these factors, <I>wor</I>'s appearance at the festival seemed
like a victory for the forces of national integration. It was as if the
festival suddenly revealed to Biaks an element of Indonesianness within
themselves. The troupe that traveled to Jakarta was selected on the
basis of recordings made by an American ethnomusicologist. People on
Biak made much of the fact that outsiders had suddenly recognized the
virtue of this neglected aspect of their traditional ways. The call to
participate provided the first step in the process of interpellation;
the singers experienced the shock of finding themselves exposed to the
Other. In the next step, the shock should have faded, putting the men and
women in the position of some Indonesians who felt right at home in their

<B></B>

New Order identities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Yet there is evidence that the singers deployed a different mode
  of domestication in response to this encounter: one that engaged
  a symbolic order in which national spaces appeared as dangerous and
  seductive sources of power and value. In other words, there is evidence
  that Jakarta remained a place to raid.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Take, for instance, the stories the singers and their families told in the
weeks leading up to our departure. From the perspective of bureaucrats in
Jakarta, Irian Jaya was a frightening, Stone Age place. But as the singers
and their families saw it, it was the rest of Indonesia that was filled
with danger; the Javanese would "walk up and stab you without uttering
a word." While this perspective might be expected from people who had
suffered at the hands of Javanese soldiers, what was less predictable
was the accompanying image of distant cities as a site for intimate
encounters. Our voyage featured surprising moments of tenderness as the
singers discovered Biaks living abroad, or as they made new acquaintances
who reminded them of loved ones back home. Jakarta may have been the
land of dangerous strangers, but it was also the home of long lost kin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What the singers posited by way of narratives they performed by way
of <I>wor.</I> As I was warned before we left, the expert singers
had trouble keeping their mind on the repertoire of songs they were
supposed to be singing. New songs kept coming to them. From compositions
expressing amazement at the ship we had boarded to a ditty on a perfume
seller's breasts, the singers' songs affirmed the strangeness of what
they experienced. The theme park, "Beautiful Indonesia in Miniature,"
was perhaps the clearest example of the kind of "machine" through which
the New Order produced docile national-cultural subjects. But as they
toured the Irian Jaya pavilion, the singers signaled in conventional
ways that they were not at home. It was the theme park's foreignness,
not its familiarity, that their actions registered when they responded
to the visit by singing <I>wor</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the face of it there was nothing terribly subversive in the singers'
activities. On stage they played their role as tokens of Indonesian
national culture quite adequately. Yet their practices also served in
the production of another social reality, at odds with the order that
arrayed Indonesia's citizens on a national-cultural grid. These two
orders intersected in the state apparatuses that produced Indonesian
national-cultural subjects. Instead of internalizing a perspective that
would have defined them in official terms, the singers, like the condemned
man and the soldier in Kafka's story, derived a peculiar pleasure from the
encounter. Domestication in this case consists in reproducing the shock of
interpellation, not in finding meaning behind the Law's meaningless force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To grasp this dynamic one must attend to the interpenetration of
ideologies. The Biaks I knew tended to emphasize characteristics of words
and things that other actors downplay in order to convey the impression
of commensurate values, orderly routines, and transparent, transmissible
meanings. Their practices employed the potential for alienation inherent
in every social gesture--every instance of exchange--whether thought or
speech. This is not to say that these individuals somehow possessed a
more truthful understanding of their practices; simply that they faced
different contradictions

<B></B>

than those who claimed to express their innermost cultural selves. For
their performances to succeed at attracting and entertaining an audience
of Biak listeners, <I>wor</I> singers had to present their songs as
evidence of something other than their own intentions, and yet they
had to be able to take credit for composing them. They had to adhere
to expectations regarding authoritative action that required that the
seat of agency appear as displaced. At the same time, in their quest for
recognition from a local audience, they had to obscure a force that was
omnipresent in the regency, in the form of institutions and apparatuses
that encouraged them to see themselves through different eyes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is with this interpenetration in mind that we must consider the
revival of Biak tradition that followed the festival in Jakarta. Less
than a year after the event, <I>wor</I> was resurrected as an official
emblem of Biak ethnicity. Although I was appalled at the time by the
speed with which people adopted the standardized version of the song
form, it is worth exploring whether something more complicated was
going on. Biak's colonial era uprisings erupted at moments resembling
that which preceded the revival of the song form. The largest outbreak
occurred at the beginning of World War II, after the mission began
promoting <I>wor</I> singing in church. In the movement that followed,
participants sang and danced and waited for the utopia that would begin
with the arrival of the ancestor who created foreign power. The revival
of <I>wor</I> was not as dramatic as the World War II uprising, but
it did contain utopian elements. Officials and villagers predicted an
influx of foreign tourists and a flood of invitations for local troupes
to perform abroad. Taking up the millennial strain always present in
official rhetoric on the "development" of postcolonial nation-states
like Indonesia, this response projected the islanders' "subjectivation"
across an eschatological horizon. The foreign would be revealed as a
local creation; the nation-state would appear as omnipresent force,
but only at the millennial moment when Biaks would startle the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the context of early 1990s Biak, one might wonder whether this subtle
form of subversion mattered. In the year 2000 its implications became
clear. With the resignation of President Suharto and the fall of the New
Order, the province has seen a resurgence of Papuan nationalism. While the
fetishization of the foreign cannot account for why this has occurred,
it sheds light on the speed with which many Biaks have shifted their
allegiances. Actions that seemed to indicate an internalization of the
New Order's "truth" may well have sheltered a very different relationship
to the regime.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When is power foreign? The answer may be always, but not always in
precisely the same way. In New Order Biak, as in the penal colony, the
alien character of authority is stressed. Yet instead of constituting
the "unconscious illusion" that ensures the efficacy of ideology,
foreignness was the product and precondition of practices that took it
as an explicit attribute of power. This does not mean that there was no
fantasy structuring social reality in Biak; only that it did not take
a predictable form. To make sense of situations like the one I have
described, we must attend to particular variants of broader

<B></B>

dilemmas as they reproduce themselves across different contexts of
social action. The gap between the machine and its internalization may be
essential to the process of subject formation. The same apparatus can,
however, act as an interface between social orders that both diverge
and overlap.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By juxtaposing my anthropological analysis with my reading of "In the
Penal Colony," I suggest that the alterity of power opens a space for its
subversion. The inscrutable faces and illegible texts of Kafka's story
do more than just register the Law's inconsistency; they also comprise
an intersection between multiple points of view. Much like the Biaks,
who use a local category, <I>amber,</I> to designate the foreign, Kafka's
narrative can only evoke the alien character of the Law by using res
that, of necessity, open onto wider worlds of meaning. The condemned
man and the soldier cannot partake in the apparatus as a senseless
site of enjoyment without gesturing towards other narratives, other
ways of making sense. My ethnographic writings focus on a situation in
which an encounter with state power similarly gives rise to something
other than the reproduction of official identities. I approach this
situation from a perspective that "In the Penal Colony" at once signals
and leaves obscure; my work on Biak is an exercise in imagining a social
order that undercuts the projects of officials and reformers alike. In
specifying this order's logic and contradictions, my findings offer
a caveat against too reductive a reading of Kafka's classic: neither
fiction nor ethnography can represent foreignness <I>as such</I>, though
both do sometimes capture its effects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For this reason, one must analyze the res one finds in
Kafka's fiction--and my fieldwork--with an eye to their historical
specificity. One must not underestimate the colonial character of both
settings. Like the condemned man and the soldier, Biaks were given no
choice but to join the political unit to which their islands now belong
at the time of western New Guinea's transfer to Indonesia. The New Order
may not have offered the form of punishment described in Kafka's story,
but its strategies for dealing with opponents included abduction, torture,
and summary execution--procedures no more transparent to those who came
up against the state's lethal force. The fact that Biaks experienced
encounters with the state as a source of pleasure as well as terror
poses a quandary for anyone who would assume the position of a Kafkan
traveler. Does it disqualify one's critique of an oppressive regime when
its victims' responses do not take the form one might expect? One of the
virtues of Kafka's story is that it refuses to offer a simple response
to the political questions it raises. In an age of U.N. peacekeepers
and international tribunals, it is worth considering the desires and
pleasures at work in the selective enforcement of universal standards
of justice and truth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Admittedly, the world of Biak is far from that of Kafka. But I hope that
this effort to move between them has not been in vain. The ethnographer,
like the traveler--and any reader of Kafka's works--invariably finds
herself in that uncertain position that "In the Penal Colony" conjures
so well. This is a position in which the interpretive project founders
on moments that block understanding, on that traumatic left-over with
which analysis begins and ends. But describing this predicament is not
the same thing as overcoming it. At the very least, this reminds us of
the importance of remaining sensitive to differences that add to each
other without quite adding up.

When the Court Theatre in Chicago announced that during its 2000-2001
season it would be staging a new chamber opera by Philip Glass based
on Franz Kafka's story, "In the Penal Colony," we decided to use the
occasion to try to open a new discussion of Kafka's remarkable text, the
relevance of which, given contemporary debates about the death penalty,
human rights, and the legacies of colonialism, was beyond doubt. In order
to stimulate new thinking we invited a group of scholars from a variety
of disciplines, most of whom would never ordinarily consider themselves
Kafka experts, to address the text without engaging the vast secondary
literature on Kafka. (The one exception to this "rule" was the inclusion
of Stanley Corngold, the noted Kafka scholar who has produced much of
this literature). We were not, in other words, interested in producing
new Kafka "scholarship" in any traditional sense of the term. We invited
our speakers, instead, to think out loud about the issues raised in
Kafka's text from the perspective of their own work and orientation. In
this sense, we sought an academic correlative to the theatrical gambit:
like the Court Theatre, we were interested in revisiting Kafka's text,
asking how it might resonate anew some eighty years after its initial
publication. The papers were given on 1 and 2 December 2000, at the
Theatre on the campus of the University of Chicago.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As is well known, Kafka himself had mixed feelings about "In the Penal
Colony<I>."</I> The story was written in the autumn of 1914 and though
Kafka considered grouping it together with "The Metamorphosis" and
"The Judgment" in a collection called "Punishments," it was only at
the urging of his friend and publisher, Kurt Wolff, that he, in 1919,
finally allowed the story to appear in print. At some level he could
not fully understand Wolff's

<B></B>

admiration for the text and Wolff himself had to admit that his own
profound love for the story was mixed with a certain horror and disgust
with respect to the "dreadful intensity of the frightful material"
(<I>die schreckhafte Intensit&auml;t des furchtbaren Stoffes</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  One of our goals at the symposium was to explore this amalgam of
  attraction and repulsion that surely characterizes every reader's
  relation to this strange work of fiction. At the core of this amalgam
  is no doubt the very thing that invites compositional, dramaturgical,
  and performative engagement with the work. We are thinking, of course,
  of the numerous references and allusions in the story to a certain
  theatricality informing the institutions of law and punishment,
  to the <I>spectacle</I> of human pain in its function as real and
  imaginary support of social and political bonds. There is something
  at the very heart of "In the Penal Colony" that would seem to open it
  to the universe of opera, a medium in which tormented bodies so often
  issue in songs of supplication that are met--or unmet--by responses
  of mercy and grace on the part of sovereigns and lovers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the central issues that preoccupied our contributors is the depth
and omnipresence of ambiguity in the text. Generally thought to be one of
Kafka's most straightforward texts, one whose plot most people can easily
follow and recall, "In the Penal Colony" proves, under closer scrutiny,
to be riddled with disorienting shifts of perspective and tone. One of
the crucial passages in the text, for example, the description of the
apparatus by the officer, includes a remarkable claim as to the spiritual
efficacy of the punishment-machine on its victim:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But how quiet he grows at just about the sixth hour! Enlightenment comes
to the most dull-witted [<I>Verstand geht dem Bl&ouml;desten auf</I>]. It
begins around the eyes. From there it radiates. A moment that might
tempt one to get under the Harrow oneself. Nothing more happens than
that the man begins to understand the inscription (<I>die Schrift zu
entziffern</I>), he purses his mouth as if he were listening. You have
seen how difficult it is to decipher the script with one's eyes; but
our man deciphers it with his wounds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his nostalgic reminiscences about the glory days of the apparatus,
the officer recalls the impact of this moment on the spectators: "How we
all absorbed the look of transration on the face of the sufferer,
how we bathed our cheeks in the radiance (<I>den Schein</I>) of that
justice, achieved at last and fading so quickly!" ("IPC" 154)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the symposium, in a round-table discussion following a performance
of his opera, Philip Glass himself recalled these scenes as the ones
that stuck with him from his first reading of the story some forty years
earlier and as the ones that, indeed, inspired his work on the opera. He
went on to associate Kafka's story with Sch&ouml;nberg's <I>Verkl&auml;rte
Nacht</I> (Transred night) and questions of art and transration
more generally. In the opera itself, Glass and JoAnne Akalaitis,
who directed the production, endow the officer (played alternately by
Eugene and Herbert Perry) with a kind of sympathy and poignancy proper
to one engaged in a spiritual quest. But what are we to make of the
ambiguity of Kafka's choice of words with respect to this moment of
"enlightenment"? The emergence of some sort of understanding specified as
a corporeal decipherment of a coded script, a decipherment that produces
what may only be the appearance (<I>den Schein</I>) of justice: is this
really the stuff of spiritual transration? And what are

<B></B>

we to make of the fact that the officer himself is denied any sort of
understanding once he subjects himself to the machinery of justice? At
the end of the story, the face of the officer "was as it had been in
life; no sign was visible of the promised redemption; what the others had
found in the machine the officer had not found. . ." ("IPC" 166). And of
course the sentence that was to be inscribed on the officer's body was
not this or that determinate commandment or injunction but rather the
general and categorical one, the very source of any spiritual dimension
of law whatsoever: "Be just!" ("IPC" 161)  Furthermore, why does the
machine break down at this particular moment, under the weight of this
commandment?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In light of such difficulties, it makes sense that one of the motifs of
the papers that follow is the status of <I>nonsense</I>-- or rather, the
limits of sense--both in the text and in the administration of justice as
represented by the text. Though these limits assume many forms, evoking,
in turn, horror, disgust, and laughter, we are tempted to correlate
them with a more general feature of Kafka's work. To use a formulation
proposed by Gershom Scholem in his correspondence with Walter Benjamin
about Kafka, the fictive world revealed in Kafka's prose is distorted by
a surplus of validity over meaning. Scholem characterizes this surplus
as the force of revelation at a zero-degree of content.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  res in Kafka's work, as well as the reader of his work, are
  constantly addressed by messages that can never be fully grasped,
  enigmatic signifiers that, as it were, get under the skin without
  ever being metabolized into a livable meaning. Though uncoupled from
  signification, they remain valid, i.e., they inform intentional life. So
  if there is "enlightenment" of some kind in the story, it may well have
  to do with this dimension of enigma at the boundary between meaning
  and the body in pain. All of the papers in this dossier explore,
  in one way or another, Kafka's remarkable meditation on this boundary.

The symposium was organized under the aegis of the newly constituted
Faculty Committee on Theater and Performance Studies and the Department
of Germanic Studies at the University of Chicago, and was made possible
by generous support from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in
New York and, at the University of Chicago: the Master of the College, the
Dean of the Division of the Humanities, and the Adelyn Russell Bogert Fund
of the Franke Institute for the Humanities. In addition to thanking each
of these sponsors (as well as the Court Theatre for hosting the event),
we want to thank our colleagues whose work is presented here--for their
willingness to venture into unfamiliar territory. Thanks to their efforts,
Kafka's text emerges here as newly compelling.

In January 1914 Arthur Roe&szlig;ler's article "Women and Art" appeared
in the <I>Stickerei-Zeitung und Spitzen Revue,</I> a journal devoted
to textile art in Germany and Austria. While the embroidery of Emmy
Zweybr&uuml;ck (<A HREF="8.2simmons_1.html"> 1</A>), a leading
textile artist in Vienna, was ostensibly his subject, Roe&szlig;ler
used the opportunity to secure women's creative activities firmly
within <I>Nadelkunst</I> and the domestic sphere. He concluded that her
embroideries deserve more praise than any "square meter of painted canvas
that any woman aspiring to 'high' art places on view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Stating that the best women's painting could only be an inadequate
  reflection of a male model, he argued that female talents lay instead
  in decoration, creations that were part of women's being, only
  hinting at an unknowable mystery beneath the ornamented surface. This
  characterization of ornament's superficiality contrasts with those
  artistic values he praised in the work of young male expressionist
  painters who were "able to turn the interior of people inside out"
  during the same period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Artists such as Egon Schiele defined an approach to painting that
  surpassed nature and became the apex of human achievement. Roe&szlig;ler
  suggested that these artists recovered art's high calling, which
  had been lost through a recent preoccupation with applied art: "They
  want to move away from applied art, which Klimt approached happily and
  frequently, sometimes even at the cost of the psychological achievement
  of an aesthetic creation. All works for them are true works of new art,
  are storage batteries of psychological forces."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contrast between ornament and psychological expression, between
surface and depth, used by art critics of the

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 247]</B>

period to characterize the stylistic shift from Gustav Klimt's
aestheticism to Schiele's expressionism, continues to be of use for
thinking about Viennese modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  The discursive interplay between ornamentalism and asceticism yields
  insights about gender's role in the divide between these attitudes
  towards form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Studies of the writings of Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos show how their
  work contributed to a critique of ornament grounded, in part, in
  responses to women's changing roles in the public sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Fashion's expansion stimulated new perceptions about women's increasing
  participation in the modern world. These perceptions provoked male
  anxieties about fashion's impact on culture and the arts at the same
  time as female artists in Vienna began to organize and assert their
  presence in both the fine and applied arts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler's celebrations of a new textile art and a new painting were
intertwined, both being part of an effort to draw gender distinctions
in a world where boundaries were becoming blurred. Too little critical
attention has been afforded the emergence of an artistic style,
linked to folk art and characterized by terms such as "primitive" and
"expressionist," within the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte between 1905 and
1908. Women artists played a role at least equal to that of men in the
development of this style, since its impetus came from textiles and it
was quickly applied to Vienna's emerging fashion industry. The discourse
surrounding that ornamental style infiltrated discussions about the art
produced by women. Young male artists, such as Kokoschka and Schiele,
had early ties to this initial "primitive" style and its application to
fashion, but distanced themselves during 1909 and 1910 by developing a
competing discourse about interiority that found expression primarily
in their treatment of skin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ornament, the focus of many debates about historical styles during the
nineteenth century in Vienna, continued to be an important issue during
the years before World War I. Otto Wagner had questioned the suitability
of using historical architectural ornament to dress contemporary buildings
during the 1890s, calling for a "raiment of modernity" equally effective
in expressing both the structural and symbolic character of the new
architecture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Similar desires for a modern style within painting and sculpture led
  to the formation of the Vienna Secession in 1897, whose frequent
  exhibitions gave the new artistic movement a significant public
  forum. Appointments of Secession members to teaching positions in the
  School of Applied Arts and the creation of the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte
  in 1903 signaled that the battle to replace historical ornament with a
  modern style in Vienna had been won and efforts to extend its influence
  and reap the financial rewards of international trade were well under
  way. Writing in <I>Die Flache,</I> a luxurious new journal devoted to
  ornament, Joseph August Lux claimed that "[t]he growing understanding of
  decorative form and color is the result of the Viennese School. People,
  who have been accustomed for decades to obtain their models from Paris,
  already today demand the 'Viennese Style.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  This style initially mixed a study of nature and artistic materials,
  typical of other currents of "art nouveau," with elements selected
  from the ancient cultures of Greece and Byzantium. Between 1905 and
  1908, however, decorative elements from the folk cultures within
  Austria-Hungary became decisive elements of the style. Exhibitions at
  the Museum of Art and Industry had

<B></B>

drawn attention to folk art during the 1880s, leading to the founding of
the Association of Austrian Folklore in 1894. The Association envisioned
the study of folk art as an important contribution to the creation of
an Austrian political identity based on cosmopolitan multiculturalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Built on ideas advanced by Crown Prince Rudolph in the 1880s, this
  political ideal hoped to demonstrate the benevolently unifying role that
  the state could play vis &agrave; vis the multitude of nationalities
  that made up the Empire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two events contributed significantly to folk art's impact on modern
Viennese ornamental style--the Exhibition of Austrian Domestic Crafts
and Folk Art of 1905 and the Imperial Jubilee Procession of 1908. The
Museum of Art and Industry spent ten years organizing the exhibition,
which ran from November 1905 to February 1906 and assembled over 4,000
examples of popular handicraft. An extensive catalogue contained essays
describing regional traditions of costume and art. Looking at the province
of Bukowina on the Empire's distant eastern border, the catalogue provided
a telling description of clothing decoration:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Nature, with its infinite riches of leaves, flowers and blooms, birds,
beetles, butterflies, and small animals, which we find more or less
stylized in embroideries or weavings, offers the subjects, some of them
copied from old embroideries that mother and grandmother completed
sometime before, however, others also newly created from individual
feelings. The seven or eight year old girl, who is already trusted with
the care of geese and sheep in the pasture, sits there, linen and needle
in hand, embroidering without model or pattern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ludwig Hevesi, a supporter of the Secession, wrote that he found "dialects
of the pure language" in the exhibition catalogue and praised the colors
"at the disposal of these primitives: the peasant wives of Czechoslovakia,
Ruthenia, Rumania, Croatia. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The exhibition's examples of folk costume and ornament were useful
in designing the Imperial Jubilee Procession. Held on 12 June 1908 to
mark the sixtieth anniversary of Emperor Franz Joseph I's reign, the
procession was witnessed by upwards of 500,000 citizens and tourists. It
was divided into one section composed of a series of groups, costumed by
prominent Viennese artists, representing historical periods of Hapsburg
rule, and another in which the Empire's diverse cultures, resplendent
in their traditional costumes, paraded before the public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The latter was a great hit with Lux, who contrasted it to the historical
  section by describing the costume parade as being

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
no longer history, no longer mere masquerade, but folk art, which still in
large part at least serves life. A peasant woman with her grand finery,
laces, embroideries, metal jewelry, stands there like an inimitable work
of art, in a colorfulness like a small peasant garden. . . . We must be
thankful for this experience. It was a beauty that one can experience
nowhere but in Austria.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like other supporters of the modern Viennese style, however, Lux took
particular pleasure in one group in the historical section. Bertold
L&ouml;ffler designed Group XIII to represent a harvest festival during
the reign of Joseph II (1765-1790). L&ouml;ffler, who

<B></B>

had been appointed to teach a master class for decorative painting and
graphic art at the School of Applied Arts in Fall 1907, involved his
students in the design of the costumes and paraphernalia. Although well
researched, the costumes were seen anew with modern eyes and commentaries
remarked on similarities to the Secession's aesthetic. L&ouml;ffler and
his students, many of whom acted the parts of eighteenth-century peasants
in the parade, created an idyllic vision of folk art under a benevolent
and enlightened monarch. Group XIII reified the ideological construct
of the Jubilee Procession--an optimistic vision of a multicultural
nation under the beneficent stewardship of Emperor Franz Joseph. Costume
designs done by L&ouml;ffler and his students for the procession were
later printed in the series of Wiener Werkst&auml;tte postcards.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taken together, the exhibition and procession encouraged a shift of
style from "tectonic simplicity" to "elaborate, dense surface decoration"
within the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  Folk pottery certainly influenced Wiener Keramik, the ceramics firm
  that L&ouml;ffler and Michael Powolny formed in 1905 that produced
  the colorful tiles proclaiming the new stylistic direction at the
  Cabaret Fledermaus. Folk textiles, however, had the greatest impact
  on the Werkst&auml;tte's new decorative style, a point made by Paul
  Westheim in response to an exhibition of Hungarian textiles:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
These works of the people are the root for a good part of all the
textiles and graphics of the young artists in Vienna. The surface
patterns of Margold, Wimmer, Zainer, etc. can be traced back without
difficulty to such stimuli from Bosnia. Only this folk art was stripped
of its na&iuml;vet&eacute;, of the original liveliness, the entirety
pervaded by a shot of fashionable sensuality, cultivated perversity,
the unbroken colors sacrificed to a feminine, elegant, perfumed sense
of color and finished with that gracefulness that pleases the delicate
nerves of Europa.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The artists Westheim mentions are men, but he describes their style in
fully feminine terms. Emmanual Margold and Eduard Josef Wimmer-Wisgrill
did, in fact, work closely with the large numbers of women who sought
careers in the applied arts after the turn of the century. Graduates of
the School of Applied Arts, the Art School for Women and Girls, and the
Royal Art Embroidery Schools responded enthusiastically to folk art and
helped define the new ornamental style.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Zweybr&uuml;ck, who had studied with Joseph Hoffmann and Franz Cizek, was
only one of many who joined the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte, regularly showed
embroideries at the Museum of Art and Industry's exhibitions, formed
co-operatives to advance sales, and became known outside Austria-Hungary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Using thread and cloth produced by modern industry, their artistic
  imaginations and highly-skilled hands sought to invest the objects
  they produced with older as well as newer values. While remaining
  within the modern fashion system, artists and consumers were drawn
  to the values of community and social reproduction that folk art
  embodied. The popularity of the printed silks, beaded bags, and
  embroidered blouses and shawls that they created contributed to the
  opening of the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte fashion department in March
  1911, headed by Wimmer-Wisgrill. Women were the majority of designers
  and assistants. Through the course of the century's second decade,
  it became the Werkst&auml;tte's most economically

<B></B>

successful and well-known unit; its products were celebrated at the 1914
Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne and in exhibitions devoted to Viennese
fashion in Berlin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="2" HREF="8.2simmons_2.html">
<IMG

SRC="button/8.2simmons_2b.gif"></A>

Wimmer-Wisgrill designed the interior of the Werkst&auml;tte's room in
the Austrian pavilion at the exhibition in Cologne, covering an entire
lower wall with a grid of fashion illustrations. Over the next year,
a series of fashion illustrations was published in twelve porfolios of
twelve prints each as <I>Mode Wien 1914/15.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Female artists produced 111 of the 144 original prints, while the
  inclusion of seven prints by Dagobert Peche rendered him the best
  represented male artist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  His hand-colored linoleum cut (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_2.html"> 2</A>), which appeared in the first
  portfolio, emphasized the block printed fabrics that had developed
  from folk textiles and become one of the Werkst&auml;tte's most popular
  products before World War I. The dress's fabric is covered with large
  clusters of flowers and leaves, a vegetative motif that extends to the
  re's frame which includes branches of laurel. Similar leaves sprout
  from the model's head, her fingers resemble tendrils, and branches
  grow from the dress's sleeves, motifs that recall the myth of Apollo
  and Daphne.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mythic suggestion of Peche's image differs from representations of
fashionable women in the prints by other artists, such as by Maria Likarz
or Lotte Calm, which depict modern scenes of athletic competition and
shopping. Since Peche became the artist most closely associated with
the Werkst&auml;tte's ornamental style during the 1910s and 1920s,
his repeated use of Daphne's image bears investigation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  His most likely source was Ovid's <I>Metamorphoses,</I> wherein Apollo,
  the heroic warrior-diety, is struck by Cupid's golden arrow and falls
  in love with Daphne, a beautiful daughter of the river god Peneus and
  Gaea, the Earth goddess.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  His love rejected by the chaste nymph, Apollo turns into a hound
  inflamed by passion and chases after Daphne to rape her. She escapes by
  praying to her father, who causes her to metamorphose into a laurel
  tree: "Her hair was changed to leaves, her arms to branches. Her
  feet, but now so swift, grew fast into sluggish roots, and her
  head was now but a tree's top. Her gleaming beauty alone remained"
  (<I>MAD</I> 35). Embracing and kissing the laurel tree, Apollo then
  proclaims, "Since you cannot be my bride, you shall at least be my
  tree. . . . My hair, my lyre, my quiver shall always be entwined with
  you, O laurel. With you shall Roman generals wreathe their heads, when
  shouts of joy shall acclaim their triumph, and long processions climb
  the Capitol" (<I>MAD</I> 41). In designs, sculpture, drawings, and
  five letters written in 1915-6, Peche treated this metamorphosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  His repeated association of the female body with vegetative life unites
  women, nature, and ornament, in some cases even inscribing leaves and
  flowers on drawn female nudes as if they were tattooed on the skin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Such images came to embody the Viennese culture of fashion and the
  discursive association of ornament and femininity during the 1910s.

Klimt's portraits of members of the Werkst&auml;tte's
clientele, as in his painting of Eugenie Primavesi (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_3.html"> 3</A>), captures well the culture
inspired by the Werkst&auml;tte's fashion department. Eugenie and her
husband Otto, who came from a prominent Moravian family of bankers
and industrialists, were among the most active customers and even
acquired a 30 percent interest in the company when it underwent economic
reorganization in 1914. In 1913 Josef Hoffmann began designing their
country villa near

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 252]</B>

Winkelsdorf in Czechoslovakia. Constructed of logs on a rubble stone
socle and capped by a thickly thatched roof, the villa utilized materials
of local vernacular architecture. Its plan and loggia with gigantic oak
columns, however, were Palladian; and the inclusion of a water turbine
to generate electricity, tennis courts, and swimming pool made the villa
an exemplary modern building in folk style.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  The interiors were richly painted with Moravian folk motifs, while the
  wallpapers, curtains, and upholstery were hand-printed designs from the
  Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. Visiting guests were provided with loose gowns
  to wear during their stay, each selecting from a stock of garments
  sewn from variously patterned Werkst&auml;tte silk fabrics. Eugenie
  is clothed in such a gown in Klimt's portrait, its colorful pattern
  spilling into the painting's field. The villa and painting embody what
  the initial enthusiasm for folk art had become in the hands of Wiener
  Werkst&auml;tte artists and patrons by the 1910s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fashion department had an audience far beyond such wealthy
patrons. Over 70,000 visitors attended a fashion exhibition in Vienna
that opened on 16 December 1915 and focused primarily on the Wiener
Werkst&auml;tte.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Max Eisler believed that this exhibition confirmed fashion's special
  character in Vienna, its emphasis on unique artistry both in the
  dresses' forms and in details such as hand embroidery. These qualities
  linked it, he said, to the Werkst&auml;tte's previous applied art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  The exhibition also prompted ten female artists within the fashion
  department to create a portfolio of twenty colored linoleum cuts
  entitled <I>Life of a Lady</I> which emphasized fashion's role in
  modern life by following a fashionable woman from hat shop to bath to
  the sales rooms of the Austrian Werkbund. Such images strengthened the
  perception, already expressed by Westheim, that Viennese ornament and
  applied arts were intensely feminine.

This perception was so strong that when Johanna Meier-Michel

the new graphic design and embroidery rather than the "fine arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  The exhibition's 315 works constituted the first major survey of both
  past women artists and contemporary production in Europe. Visitors were
  numerous and sales strong at this and the group's second exhibition,
  indications of women's growing participation in the world of visual
  culture. Martha Hofrichter's cover for the second catalogue, an image
  of female wooden dolls with painted aprons simulating embroidery,
  added children to the exhibition's frame of reference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  Indeed, children's art was closely linked with folk art, a fact made
  clear by the following comment about the children's art room at the
  1908 Kunstschau--"Primitive folk art, lamented by many as lost, blooms
  here ever anew."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  Contemporary embroideries, described as "expressionist orgies of color,"

  Helene Funke's painting <I>Hungarian Girl</I> (<A

  1911 exhibition, joined youth, femaleness, and folk embroidery in a
  single work which one critic termed "ghastly Van Goghism" connected
  with the new trends of Neoprimitivism and Expressionism.

  Roe&szlig;ler declared Funke to be one of the exhibition's stronger
  painters, but added that such painting by a woman was always second-hand

activity surpassing nature. But women were excluded from this level of
achievement, because, he concluded, "as long as art arises from stress
and compulsion, which are specific to a male spirit and disposition,"
fine art would remain "'a necessary product of male particularism,'
the effort for universal synthesis."

Roe&szlig;ler's comment about Kokoschka's and Schiele's efforts to
distance themselves from applied art was an observation about their
origins. Kokoschka first came to public attention as a student in
L&ouml;ffler's class at the School of Applied Arts where he participated
in graphic design projects for the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. <I>Dancer in
a Meadow</I> (<A HREF="8.2simmons_6.html"> 6</A>), one of his
postcard designs from fall 1907 anticipated L&ouml;ffler's contributions
to the Jubilee Procession.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  The girl's beflowered, wide-brimmed straw hat and her skirt trimmed
  with lace and embroidery are similar to the idyllic peasant world
  evoked by L&ouml;ffler's group's designs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  While other of Kokoschka's postcards represent aspects of the new
  textile arts, three large cartoons called <I>Bearers of Dreams</I>
  (one major project shown at the 1908 Kunstschau) were designed to be
  executed as textiles. Several sources suggest that he considered the
  cartoons to be studies toward six embroidered panels or tapestries
  for the Palais Stoclet's ladies' sitting room. In the end, however,
  these designs, described as "having the character of naive folk art,"
  were replaced by Carl Czeschka's wall decorations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Kokoschka's early work was related to the new decorative style,
when his cartoons and children's book called <I>Dreaming Boys</I>--both
published by the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte--were shown at the 1908
Kunstschau, their highly personal psychological characters were quickly
remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Unlike those whose books were based on existing fairy-tales and stories,
  illustrated by Secession members, and published by Martin Gerlach in
  a series for children, Kokoschka composed his own text and produced
  images better described as evocative than illustrative. Max Mell,
  whom Kokoschka consulted about the book, noted its chaotic quality
  and described it as a serious artistic probing of puberty. About the
  isolated adolescent girl and boy in the final plate, he wrote, "Between
  these poles of puberty, the holy lack of desire and the lust for life,
  lie anxiety, horrible secrecy, lust for adventure, the idyllic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  In his autobiography, Kokoschka refers to the book as his first love
  letter to Lilith, a young Swede who had already disappeared from his
  life when the book appeared.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  But Li, the girl associated with "the bird-woods of the north" in the
  story, was, in fact, Lilith Lang, a sixteen-year-old Austrian student
  at the School of Applied Arts (<I>DjK</I> 260). She appears in the
  story after the narrator, growing aware of his sexuality and approaching
  adulthood, dreams of adventures in exotic worlds, of becoming a werewolf
  who invades the sites and bodies of conventional society. While the
  narrator dances "the desires of the sexes" in a garden, Li steps
  "from the festoons of vermilion flowers and sulfurous yellow stars."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Meeting her, he feels that he has already known her body's angular
  gesture and has expected her arrival at his silver bedspread. The
  pleasures of sexual desire are evoked, along with unanswered
  declarations of love and feelings of possessiveness--

After the relationship cools, the story ends with a reflection about
his changed state: "I was a stumbler / when I discovered my flesh /
and a lover of everything / when I spoke with a girl" (<I>OKS</I> 120).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kokoschka's letters to Erwin Lang, Lilith's brother, express his
bitterness over the relationship's breakup during the winter of
1907-8 (<I>OKL</I> 16). Speculation about this breakup and its impact
is difficult, but it seems likely that a marriage proposal coupled with
intense possessiveness might have been resisted by a young woman with
close connections to the feminist movement in Austria.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Li's association with embroidery and lace in the story is related to
  the narrator's ability to see her as no one else could, his revelation
  of her form and character understood as a demonstration of love
  and entitlement to her. This passage recalls Kokoschka's sketches
  of Lang's naked body in angular poses and in motion, drawings that
  contributed to the book's final plate and were probably shown at the
  1908 Kunstschau. These drawings are arguably his first works that
  focus on psychological expression, a direction that Mell encouraged,
  urging him to consider the "noble task" of portraiture, "to uncover
  the essence of a person's face" ("CK" 252).

During 1908 and 1909, after meeting Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos, Kokoschka
began to distance himself from the production of applied art. Loos,
impressed by his pieces in the 1908 Kunstschau, recalled that

he was employed by the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte and was occupied with the

This clarity formed as part of a development of ideas eventually expressed
in "Ornament and Crime," a lecture of 1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  Ideas that originated in his writings at the turn of the century became
  publicity-seeking polemic as he condemned the Jubilee Procession for
  its display of ornament, calling its participants "tribes" of a pagan
  past who made manifest the Empire's backwardness. America and England,
  where efficient and economical functionalism dictated the abandonment
  of ornament, were his models of modernity, while Papuans with tattooed
  faces and elaborately ornamented articles of daily use represented
  modernism's Other. Drawing from the writings of Cesare Lombroso and
  various ethnographers, Loos rendered the tattoo a topos of everything
  uncivilized and backward, an embodiment of erotic and violent origins
  that modern society was compelled to suppress. In this, he revived
  a trope employed previously in an 1898 essay on women's fashion in
  which he declared, "The lower the culture, the more apparent the
  ornament. Ornament is something that must be overcome. The

<B></B>

Papuan and the criminal ornament their skin. . . . But the bicycle
and the steam engine are free of ornament. The march of civilization
systematically liberates object after object from ornamentation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  The article decried fashion as outdated ornament that bore witness
  to women's subjugated condition. While men had largely abandoned
  ornamental dress in the nineteenth century, Loos asserted that women's
  fashion began to change rapidly as more novelty became necessary to
  arouse desire in men and draw them into the marriages that give women
  social status.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This article, as well as others by Loos, extolled the functionality
and quality of English men's clothing, opposing that restrained and
seemingly timeless style both to current Parisian fashion and efforts
by artists to reform fashion. Rather than dress becoming expressive
of individuality, he believed that modern individuals should adopt
a neutral mask to protect the self. He addressed his ideas to the
"aristocrats of the spirit" who would allow "the Slovak farmer's wife
who embroiders her lace" to continue to derive pleasure from her work,
for she knew no better culture. Yet judging from his own interiors, such
an aristocrat could nevertheless enjoy a quality Persian carpet in his
modern apartment. In light of this seeming contradiction Loos concludes
that "he who goes to listen to the Ninth Symphony and who then sits down
to draw up a wallpaper pattern, is either a rogue or a degenerate."

Kokoschka's suspicions about fashion's inauthenticity in the modern
world are elaborated in a wry letter sent to Erwin Lang in the winter

His use of ornament certainly changed with his increased contact with
Loos, as is demonstrated by an analysis of the mother and child motif
that he obsessively drew during 1908-9. While some fantastic scenes
do employ heavy gestural marks across the paper's surface deriving
from van Gogh's reed pen drawings, others are studies from models. The
res' embroidered garments in several drawings seem worn, like the
bodies of their wearers, peasants drawn away from their rural past and
proletarianized by the modern city. Simultaneously, however, another
type of ornament, the tattoo, began to fascinate Kokoschka.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  Speaking of his initial preference for the Museum of Natural History
  over the Museum of Art History, he claimed he could grasp the import of
  "a Polynesian mask with its incised tattooing . . . at once, because
  I could feel my own facial nerves reacting to cold and hunger in the
  same way," but concludes that "For all my sympathy with primitive art,
  it would not have occurred to me to imitate it. I was not a savage. I
  would have had to live like them for my imitation to be genuine"
  (<I>ML</I> 19-20). Yet a connection of such material to his art
  was noted by several critics at the time, as when one described the sea
  and cliffs represented in <I>The Bearers of Dreams</I> as looking as if
  they were "tattooed with strange plants and animals" ("CK" 250). Another
  described <I>Warrior</I> (<A HREF="8.2simmons_7.html">6</A>,

Zealand fetish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Indeed Kokoschka would have been familiar with the Museum of Natural
  History's rich collection of Oceanic art, including numerous Polynesian
  masks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  However, human skulls, overmodelled with clay to restore facial forms
  and then painted with decorative patterns, were also an important
  component of the collection. An extensive group of these had been
  collected by the Mission House St. Gabriel and Dr. Rudolf P&ouml;ch
  from the Sepik River area of Papua-New Guinea.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Dr. P&ouml;ch lectured about his expedition and the objects collected
  after they were given to the museum in 1907.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  He stressed that Papuans believed that the head was rich in <I>mana</I>
  (spirit), and this was why skulls taken in warfare and those of
  important clan members were preserved. The taking of the first head
  was an important step in a boy's rise to manhood, for skulls were
  tokens of bravery and transmitted power to the victorious warrior.

Kokokschka's <I>Warrior</I> was likely inspired by such material. Its
unfired clay surface is heavily worked, with raised and incised lines
tinted blue and red suggesting the coursing of blood beneath the skin. The
eyes, with blue irises, framed by the socket's

<B></B>

reddish ochre surface, appear frozen in an eternal stare. The mouth
gapes like a wound below. Supported on a long neck and tilted slightly
upwards as if in awe or startled reaction, the head resembles a type
of overmodeled skull (<A HREF="8.2simmons_8.html"> 8</A>) often
mounted atop a woven basket mask, called the big-<I>Abwan.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  These skulls, overmodeled to make the face long and thin with a
  huge nose, also rise as if on a long neck above the basket's body,
  which conceals the wearer's torso and head. Painted patterns swirl
  across the face's surface and help to emphasize the eyes, nostrils,
  and mouth. Kokoschka appears to have imitated the abstract patterns
  in indices of skin wrinkles, blood vessels, and nerves. While the form
  was converted to a more naturalistic Western idiom, he clearly hoped to
  retain a sense of ritual and myth. Many years later, in the context of
  a story about the horrors of World War I, he reacted with anger when
  a lover showed him the death mask of her former husband. "It may be
  that this," he wrote,

was why from very ancient times people have modeled the faces of their
dead--to keep death away. Perhaps it began with painting the chief's dead
face with red ochre, the color of life. Later they covered the skull
with gold leaf, which was more resistant to the passage of time. There
was the mask of Agamemnon from the tomb at Mycenae.

In the same story he also discusses his own fascination with prehistoric
skulls found in natural history museums. He attributed the holes that
are often bored in them to early man's practice of headhunting to gain
nourishment from the brain of his victim, explaining that the practice's
cessation was an important step in "man's evolution from a cannibal to
a paterfamilias" (<I>SR</I> 35). But for modern man, Kokoschka claims,
"the terror has crawled away down into our subconscious. It is in
the unconscious realm that we work off our bad conscience, like our
pussy-cat decently covering up her excrement in the sand-box provided"
(ibid.). With the title <I>Warrior,</I> Kokoschka sought to associate
his self-portrait with the terrors of combat and rituals that instilled
and maintained gendered power differences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
  Through his effort to turn ancient ornament into blood vessels and
  nerves, he simultaneously declares his modernity and critiques fine
  art's emphasis on an intense interior life, a quality that many critics
  maintained was lacking in contemporary, woman-centered ornament and
  applied art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The exhibition of <I>Warrior</I> under a glass cover at the Kunstschau
imbued it with an exotic otherness, leading critics to invoke the
ethnographic museum and Paul Gauguin in their responses to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
  A large exhibition of Gauguin's work at the Miethke Gallery in 1907

  Since European longing for escape had been constructed first by Daniel
  Defoe's <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> , it is perhaps not surprising
  that during 1908-9 Kokoschka undertook a set of illustrations
  for that novel. When they were exhibited at the 1909 Kunstschau,
  Ludwig Erik Tesar, an art critic who had previously published a German
  translation of the novel, responded enthusiastically,

it's real illustration, not the type that chatters tactlessly about the
story, but the type that picks out and emphasizes crucial sentences and
words, actions and feelings. The personal note of the illustrator lies
in the selection of significant passages, his greatness in the artistic
independence with which he strengthens the poetic through a corresponding
artistic symbolism.

Comparisons with previous illustrations for Crusoe confirm the originality
of Kokoschka's approach and suggest why Karl Kraus felt compelled to
advertise--without success--for publication funds in the pages of
<I>Die Fackel.</I> While a contemporary study of the novel's place
in the history of children's literature recommended its aesthetic and
pedagogical value as a counter to the sensationalism and sensuality of
pulp adventure stories, one doubts that the author would have found the
same values in Kokoschka's illustrations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  Gratuitous violence, a quality that educational reformers decried
  in colportage literature and films of the period, seems to break
  out, for instance, in Kokoschka's <I>Man Running Amok</I> (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_9.html"> 9</A>). The drawing depicts an
  episode in Madagascar after Crusoe was rescued from the Caribbean
  island where he had been marooned while sailing to Africa to buy slaves
  for his Brazilian plantation. After a sailor raped a native girl,
  the natives attacked the trading party, killing some and forcing the
  remainder back to ship. A group of sailors, against Crusoe's advice,
  then armed themselves for reprisal and proceeded to torch all the huts
  and slaughter over 150 inhabitants. Crusoe, however, recounts that he
  mastered his rage and refrained from

<B></B>

slaughter, and it is, perhaps, his silhouette at lower right, a passive
spectator before the blazing spectacle of something like a cinema
screen. Tattoos on his arm indicate the murderous sailor: amidst traces
of veins are an anchor, pierced heart, and the initials O. K. and L. L.,
which effectively insert Kokoschka's failed relationship with Lilith Lang
into the image. The motifs are typical of sailors' tattoos, while the
use of initials points to the practice's rebirth in European culture
when sailors on James Cook's voyages had their initials tattooed on
their arms in Polynesia.

Polynesian tattoos may have played some role in Kokoschka's thinking about
the costumes and drawings for his play <I>Murderer, Hope of Women.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  The graphic marks demand attention in his image of "Man"
  subduing "Woman," whose "graphic spontaneity may be read

<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  The marks originate in observation of anatomy and drapery, but clearly
  exceed that representational code to become signs in themselves. As
  seen in a drawing from Augustin Kr&auml;mer's

<B></B>

1902 study of Samoan culture (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_1.html"> 11</A>), tattoos often had a mimetic
relationship not only to surface anatomy, but revealed the interior on
the skin surface. But these relationships were exceeded by development
of meanings within the cultural system of marking. While Kokoschka's
marks do evoke "nerve lines, muscles and tendons," as he says, they are
also loaded with meanings related to the discourses about the tattoo
in 'primitive' cultures. The initials O. K. on the murderous sailor's
arm--like his shaved head--also secure an identification with European
sub-groups such as imprisoned criminals, an interest that is also briefly
visible in his drawings for <I>Der Sturm</I> during 1910 of circus and
variety performers, who are also tattooed.

Egon Schiele, although educated at the Academy of Fine Art rather than
the School of Applied Art, began his career with a close relationship
to the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. A group of four early works, including
<I>Portrait of a Woman with Black Hat</I> (<I>Gertrude Schiele</I>)
(<A HREF="8.2simmons_2.html"> 12</A>), that he exhibited at the
1909 Kunstschau were strongly influenced by Klimt's decorative portraits
of women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
  Klimt personally invited his participation in the 1909 Kunstschau
  and, at the end of the year, secured a position for him in the Wiener
  Werkst&auml;tte where he briefly designed men's and women's fashions
  as well as

<B></B>

postcards that treated the theme of fashion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  Schiele's sister Melanie, who designed many of her own clothes, supplied
  the hat and ermine neck wrap worn by their sister Gertrude in the 1909
  portrait, along with the decorative coverlet that she holds in her
  hands. The portrait's background, like Schiele's other early works,
  was originally executed in metallic paint in an effort cheaply to
  emulate Klimt's application of gold and silver leaf to his paintings'
  surfaces. However, at some point he painted this background over with
  white paint, lending greater emphasis to the re's psychological
  presence. The image of a young woman fashionably dressed for the
  street, seeming to show a decoratively patterned fabric to the viewer,
  nevertheless remains strongly related to the Werkst&auml;tte--an
  observation reinforced by the fact that Schiele subsequently obtained
  a modeling job for Gertrude in the Werkst&auml;tte's fashion department.

It was thus predominantly issues of fashion and clothing (rather than
ornamental pattern and Polynesian tattooing as with Kokoschka) that
helped to frame Schiele's preoccupation with issues of interiority during
1909-11. The sole exception from that period is found in a re
study of a dancer who partnered with Erwin Osen, a painter friend of
Schiele's. Why she assumed the stage name "Moa"--also the name of New
Zealand's large, extinct, flightless bird--is unknown, but her thick
mane of black hair certainly resembled that of Polynesian women in
photographs taken for anthropological and colonialist texts. A painting
on paper of Moa from 1911 (<A HREF="8.2simmons_3.html"> 13</A>)
demonstrates how Schiele's re studies revolve around the tension
between clothing and body. If a nude is defined as an idealized set of
artistic conventions--harmonious pose, adjusted proportions, excision of
body hair and imperfections, lack of clothes constructed as a "natural"
state--then Schiele's res are better described as naked. This was a
recognition on his part akin to J. C. Fl&uuml;gel's observation in 1930
that "Clothes, though seemingly mere extraneous appendages, have entered
into the very core of our existence

<B></B>

 as social beings," and further "of all the motives for the wearing
 of clothes, those connected with the sexual life have an altogether
 predominant position."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting aspects relating Schiele's work to fashion
is its role in increasing sexual allusion in fashion illustration. In
the initial Wiener Werkst&auml;tte fashion postcards of 1911 Mela
K&ouml;hler stylized fashion's forms, but the illustration remained
essentially functional, concerned with showing the dress well in an
environment that lent appropriate prestige.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
  Otto Lendecke had learned a similar approach through his work for Paul
  Poiret in Paris, but a drawing done in Vienna around 1912 evidences
  a new quality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
  The re strikes a pose of sexual solicitation against a void in
  order to highlight the slits in the blue overdress. It is difficult to
  explain other than as a response to Schiele's works, which were known
  in the fashion department since Wimmer-Wisgrill had become one of the
  artist's collectors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  In many of Schiele's works similar poses are struck which also
  stretch to the field's edge. Raised elbow and revealed axillar hair in
  Lendecke's drawing suggest the exposed pubes in Schiele's explicitly
  erotic drawings, the trajectory of both images pointing to the future

Clothing's role in social construction and its motivation in sexual
expression are seen not only in Schiele's studies of women and himself,
but also in those of the painter Max Oppenheimer. Between 1908 and 1911
Oppenheimer moved his work in a direction similar to that of Kokoschka
and Schiele; his anti-ornamental sentiment is reflected in a statement
made to Roe&szlig;ler that "The decorative is the most primitive form
of painterly expression. It will always be the hobby horse of those who
enjoy ordinary coarse sensations and are unable to have a feeling for
anything but the 'applied.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
  Roe&szlig;ler's description of Oppenheimer's appearance as making
  "him stand out at the first glance with his somewhat idiosyncratic
  but always distinguished clothing" could also be applied to other
  writers and artists--like Kokoschka and Schiele--who were turning from
  aestheticism to asceticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
  Recognizing that their life and art needed to be on display in the
  contemporary art world, but striving to deny any relationship to that
  world's commerce, they cultivated an overall look of aristocratic
  elegance touched with subtly unique detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
  The result is seen in a drawing by Schiele (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_4.html"> 14</A>) in which Oppenheimer seems
  simultaneously to retreat and reveal himself through the cut of his
  black suit. The relationship of dress to the male subject's sexuality
  is suggested by the placement of his hands, an issue also raised by
  a drawing in <I>Die Muskete</I> that satirized a self-portrait shown
  by Oppenheimer in the 1908 Kunstschau. It represents him in a men's
  room and is captioned: "It is requested to arrange one's clothing
  before leaving."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
  The drawing in the satire magazine likely pointed to his homosexuality
  through his clothing, an issue also raised by Schiele's drawings
  of him. These show him lying, both prone and supine, on a bed
  with his legs extending toward the viewer. In the first case,
  the foreshortening leads the eye to the buttocks, in the second
  (<A HREF="8.2simmons_5.html"> 15</A>) to the groin which is
  indicated by his hand, a gesture made telling by the model's languid
  face which returns the gaze.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
  The hand and face attract the eye by their colors, because the
  chalk outlines of Oppenheimer's suit remain unfilled. The touches
  of watercolor run the spectrum from green to red and seem to reveal
  both the surface of the skin and a condition beneath it, an effect
  seen most vividly in the re's right hand where only the bones are
  picked out by the brush.

While Schiele's approach to re drawing undoubtedly derived in
large part from August Rodin, he challenged one convention of the
nude--inviolate skin--that Rodin had retained. Clothing would often
become the immaterial, unexamined surface that skin had once been,
as in a self-portrait (<A HREF="8.2simmons_6.html"> 16</A>)
once owned by Wimmer-Wisgrill where the paper is untouched within the
contours of the shirt's vest, while the arms are glimpsed through the
transparent sleeves. Short hairs growing from the neck's nape declare the
body's life and primacy over social conventions such as clothing. Oil's
viscosity adds to this quality in <I>Portrait of Dr. Erwin Graff</I> (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_7.html"> 17</A>), a gynecologist who permitted
Schiele to draw his patients at the Vienna Medical School. Graff's skin's
imperfect materiality, suggested particularly through the bandaged
finger, stands at odds with the antiseptic white of his scrubs. This
materiality in Schiele's and Kokoschka's works always gives access to
an interiority ultimately alone and moving towards death, as indicated
in the following lines written by Roe&szlig;ler about the skin of paint
in Kokoschka's portraits: "He smears it like ointment and lets it cake
into a scab and heal

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 269]</B>

into scar tissue. . . . He paints their mite infested skin, their
ulcerating flesh, which stews in inner heat, is worn down by debauchery,
eaten away by sickness."

Alfred Gell, in his study of Polynesian tattooing, considers skin's
cross-cultural role as symbolic form. While some societies, such as
those in Polynesia, have viewed the skin as an appropriate support and
vehicle for expression of social relations, others, including most in
modern Europe, have developed prohibitions on the skin's marking.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
  Individuals in the New Guinean highlands may view body decoration as
  a means to display their true selves' links to ancestors and cultural
  myths, but Europeans at the turn of the century believed that the true
  self, the interior one, remained hidden from public view by the skin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
  In the final lines of "Ornament and Crime" Loos expressed that
  "Primitive men had to differentiate themselves by various colors,
  modern man needs his clothes as a mask. His individuality is so strong
  that it can no longer be expressed in terms of items of clothing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
  This emphasis on a rich interior existence grew from an altered concept
  of childhood that had developed in Europe during the eighteenth century
  and coalesced in Freud's theory of the unconscious.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
  Psychic identity came to be experienced as an inner space rooted in
  childhood's lost history. This conceptual framework helps to link
  the Viennese expressionists' extraordinary focus on children to their
  equally unusual effort to convey unseen psychic life. The depiction of
  skin's material condition, like the use of expressive dance movements
  and auratic emanations, provided a means to allude to a hidden condition
  that originated in the separations and conflicts of childhood.

Schiele's <I>The Birth of Genius</I> (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_8.html"> 18</A>), a painting of 1911 since
destroyed, imagined and reenacted an infant's severance from its initial
fused state with the mother's body. A startled face looks out from a
transparent womb, the infant's hand tests the space of culture that his
skin now meets without mediation. The motif, according to Roe&szlig;ler,
had its origin in December 1910 when he, in response to Schiele's
complaints about his own mother, suggested that the artist execute a
series on the theme of motherhood.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
  Schiele was immediately drawn to the idea of a dead mother and painted
  an initial version that he presented as a gift to Roe&szlig;ler
  on Christmas Eve 1910. In the first version he clearly wanted to
  encourage contemplation of the painting's relationship to traditional
  representations of mother and child in genre and religious painting,
  for the heads incline toward each other, suggesting that the infant
  is enclosed by a blanket and both are asleep. Only the mother's
  ashen color challenges this interpretation and, upon reflection,
  forces the realization that this is a view into the womb, eliciting
  shock in response to the macabre transformation of the theme. In the
  second version, however, the mother's head and hand are more clearly
  cadaverous and the tender touching of heads was removed, changes that
  brutally call attention to the severings of parturition and the later
  individuation of consciousness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler located the work's impetus solely in Schiele's personal
history, never mentioning a possible relationship to the paintings on
view at the December 1910 <I>The Art of the Woman</I> exhibition. Julie
Johnson has shown how the exhibition's organizers deliberately "selected
works which would represent aspects of domestic femininity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>

Images of motives and children were plentiful, perhaps to reaffirm
traditional female roles to a public who could have been disturbed by
the exhibition's bold assertion of women's presence in the history and
current practice of visual arts. In his review of that exhibition,
Roe&szlig;ler stressed that woman's natural role was that of mother
rather than of painter or sculptor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
  He continued to espouse this view in his article about Zweybr&uuml;ck,
  arguing that women were more suited to those arts that allowed them
  to remain a riddle, singing, dancing, and decorating. This was woman's
  natural role, because, as he explained,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Each man was only wholly inside woman's being once, as an unborn child;
but in his later life he retains only an uncertain, dream-like memory
about that internalized existence. And precisely because of that, because
woman by her mere existence alone already has a strong impact, man values
her as an artist only if it is a matter of a particularly feminine art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler valued Zweybr&uuml;ck principally as a craftswoman,
for embroidery had been construed as a highly gendered art since the
nineteenth century. This conformed to textile's gendered status in
European folk cultures where cloth was an important means of social
reproduction. Celebratory gifts of textiles bound groups together and
the transmission of techniques connected women to both their ancestors
and progeny, encouraging the analogizing of textile production with
human reproduction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was exactly such feminized ties that Schiele denied in his painting. In
a letter written to his mother two years after <I>The Birth of Genius,</I>
he made an extraordinary claim that says much about his understanding
of the artist's imagination and psychological state. "This is the great
separation," he told her:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Without doubt I will be the greatest, the most beautiful, the most
valuable, the purest, and the most precious fruit--through my independent

will still leave behind eternal life: therefore how great must be your
joy--to have borne me?

This imagined separation involved much more than personal psychological
history. It was, in effect, one of expressionism's myths of origin,
a fantasy about the relative values of fine and applied art, about
painting's eternal life as opposed to textile's decay. Through such
myths, male expressionist artists struggled to separate themselves from
the growing presence of women in the Viennese art world as well as the
discourse about ornament and fashion that accompanied women's expanding
roles in the public sphere.

Kokoschka's design for the Jubilee's poster also shows an imaginative
dimension quite different from other artists involved with the
festival. The flag bearer's beard and the waving of palm fronds recall
images from the ancient Near East, such as the reliefs of captured
nationalities bearing tribute to Assyrian kings at Nimrud and Nippur. The
trance-like poses and references to ancient despotism are at odds with
L&ouml;ffler's medieval pageantry in his poster and eighteenth-century

At his coterie's gatherings, Kafka was well known for laughing out
loud during the readings of his tales--and being the only one to do
so. He reportedly laughed at the most inopportune moments, moments of
the greatest torment to his hero, of the bleakest hour, moments of the
most grotesque and exquisite torture to his hero's psyche and body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A Kafka who laughs out loud at his own terrifying story, who laughs not
nervously but vigorously, is hardly recognizable to us, schooled as we are
on modernist readings of his voice. By this modernist cast he is inactive,
sad, despondent, drifting in a universe abandoned by God, pessimistic,
sullen--in short, unfunny. Yet Slavoj  Zizek demonstrates that
"Kafka's problem is, on the contrary, that in this universe God is <I>too
present</I> in the guise of various obscene, nauseous phenomena. Kafka's
universe is a world in which God . . . has gotten too close to us."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  If God is not focally absent in Kafka, then His proximity and fullness
  as ironic interlocutor in conversation with humanity offers the
  possibility of the ultimate and strange solace of irony. For Milan
  Kundera, Kafka devot&eacute; and countryman, the craft of the novel
  is that of irony. He considers the novel consubstantial with irony,
  and the wisdom of the novel the full reverberation of God's laughter
  at man thinking. "There is a fine Jewish proverb," he writes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Man thinks, God laughs. Inspired by that adage, I like to imagine
that Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais heard God's laughter one day, and thus
was born the idea of the first great European novel. It pleases me to
think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's
laughter. But why does God laugh at the sight of

<B></B>

man thinking? Because man thinks and the truth escapes him. Because the
more men think, the more one man's thought diverges from another's. And
finally, because man is never what he thinks he is.

The Old Testament is replete with the <I>proximal</I> ironies of a
God-interlocutor, the laughter of a God exceedingly close to humanity:
Job thinks and the truth escapes him; Adam and Eve are beloved and
are exiled; Moses leads his exodus but is not given to see the fruit
of freedom; Abraham, willing to sacrifice his son, is exempted from
demonstrating this willingness. None of these laugh at God's ways. But
what of Sarah? Sarah does laugh at God's ironies--and is not punished.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three men appear to Abraham (some exegetical remarks cite them as angels,
some as God triumvirate); and they ask him,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Where is your wife Sarah?" And he replied, "There, in the tent." Then
one said, "I will return to you when life is due and your wife Sarah
shall have a son!" Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which
was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah
had stopped having the periods of women. And Sarah laughed to herself,
saying, "Now that I am withered, am I to have enjoyment--with my husband
so old?" Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying,
'Shall I in truth bear a child, old as I am?' Is anything too wondrous
for the LORD? I will return to you at the time that life is due, and
Sarah shall have a son." [Gen. 18:9-14; my translation]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sarah's beauty was legendary but it was barren: she remained childless
until the fulfillment of God's (laughable) promise that she would be
"a mother of nations" (Gen. 17:16). Old as she and Abraham were--she in
her 90s, he a centenarian--she gave birth to the promised son. Sarah's
doubt of God (giving her maidservant Hagar to Abraham as a surrogate
mother, she enterprisingly fulfills God's promise <I>for</I> Him) is
often cited as the center of this tale. Yet Sarah is not punished for
her lapse of faith; she is not scolded for her skeptical laughter, her
gallows humor. She is instead rewarded. She laughs (<I>va-titzchak</I>)
and it is her gift: "Sarah remarked, 'God has prepared laughter for me;
everyone who hears of it will laugh with me" (Gen. 21:6). Her laughter
is embodied forever in God's award of Isaac (<I>Vitzchak</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tale of Sarah is often eclipsed by that of Abraham. It is sometimes
treated as a tale of prophetic onomastics, of the iconicity of Isaac's
naming; it is more accurately treated as a tale of irony, the tale
Kundera in his <I>Book of Laughter and Forgetting</I> tells between the
lines. This novel seems, on its surface, to bypass the biblical in its
comprehensive ironies. But the careful reader with an appropriately rich
"meditative background" (Kundera's term) will note an Old Testament echo
in the love and longing that the character Mr. Kundera has for "Sarah,
the Jewish girl, Sarah my sister." Perhaps her existence somewhere will
countermand the angels' "fearsome laughter." The devils, on the other
hand, laugh joyously, incipiently, devilishly at the angels who are the
arbiters of world order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The devils' laughter exceeds order and suits, as much as Kundera might
  deny it, the revelry in ambiguity that Zizek proposes
  is Kafka's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still, Kundera has done much to recuperate Kafka's jocundity, his very
real comedic touch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  Irony is often, strangely, penned away from comedy or the humorous;
  but in

<B></B>

Kafka, it is uproariously funny. His comic tragic res are those of
Job, Prometheus, Christ, Adam, and Satan, the exiled angel. His laugh,
like Sarah's, incorporates all the semantic field of laughability: joy,
absurdity, irony, mockery. In turn, God's laughter--Isaac--fixes meaning
as an end of interpretation. Sarah's laugh dwells in the moment; God's
incorporates a moment into the universe of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka would likely have laughed robustly at the very moment in his "In the
Penal Colony" that the spike is driven through the officer's head. But how
is Kafka funny to himself and so unfunny to modern sensibilities? Does
the spike undo the machine of interpretation? Is that a moment when the
text becomes "a coagulated, stigmatized, signifying chain repelling
signification with an excess of sticky enjoyment?" (<I>LA</I> 151)
These questions require an exploration of the effect of gesture in
Kafka's writing, specifically in order to expose laughter itself as a
gesture--a resistance of--and to--interpretation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the second of December, 1914, at one of the regular salon meetings of
Kafka's writers group--a group including Max Brod, Franz Werfel, and Otto
Pick--Kafka read "In the Penal Colony" aloud. Famously dissatisfied with
his own writings, he was noncharacteristically "easy" on his latest work:
"am not entirely dissatisfied," he recorded in his diary, "except for
its glaring and ineradicable faults."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  But what follows in the diary is of even greater relevance to an
  inquiry into gesture:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Werfel read some poems and two acts of <I>Esther, Kaiserin von</I> P<I>ersien.</I> The acts carry one away. But I am easily carried
away. The criticisms and comparisons put forward by Max, who was not
entirely satisfied with the piece, disturb me, and I am no longer so sure
of my impression of the play as a whole as I was while listening to it,
when it overwhelmed me. I remember the Yiddish actors. W.'s handsome
sisters. The elder one leaned against the chair, often looked at the
mirror out of the corner of her eye, and then--as if she were not already
devoured by my eyes--gently pointed a finger to a brooch pinned on her
blouse. It was a low-cut dark blue blouse, her throat was covered with
a tulle scarf. Repeated accounting of something that happened at the

Kafka's recollection of his first experience with the Yiddish theatre
shows an obsession with gesture. Elsewhere in the diaries, he takes
detailed notes on the history of Yiddish theatre, including its important
dates and plays and politics. The Jewish theatre disturbed Kafka:
he felt alien to it but heard in it too his own internal voice. This
ambivalence expresses ambivalence about his own identity. Further, it
is clear from the diary entries that the cabaret quality, the stylized
movements, and the almost circus-like mannerism resonated with his own
sense of the secret life of things.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The theatre of gestures--Kafka's unique emblem--makes his work at once
so naturalistic and terribly difficult to translate to the stage. His
scenes are essentially performative: his depictions of sex, for example,
are always public, with someone watching and often annotating. The
voyeurism in every expectedly "intimate" moment is a hallmark of his
burlesques. Gazes are constantly interpenetrating. His matrices of arms

<B></B>

and legs and eyes, ears and fingers and hair--a world where human
limbs sport minds of their own--are more complexes of interiority
than characters' "thoughts." The secret life of things and their
self-appointments on the world stage are of the utmost importance in the
fate of man. This common language of gesture afforded Kafka pleasure in
the theatre in general, and in the Yiddish theatre in particular. To
acknowledge the common bond between his stylizations and the Yiddish
theatre's <I>kabuki</I> is to uncover the language of gesture so
fundamental to an understanding of Kafka's fiction and phenomenology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's fictive worlds are worlds of things. Gestures--the language
of the sensate body--play off one another in his tales as they do in
the stylized choreography of Yiddish theatre. In this fashion they
establish a discrete dialogue with the reader outside of speech (if
not outside of semiotics) that exploits the reader's ability to sense
"meaning" rather than translate it. Take, for example, the rosy, whorled
wound of the patient in "A Country Doctor": the worms bore within the
folds of flesh and skin as they burrow, they cannot help but elicit a
<I>felt</I> repulsion, even nausea in the reader. Such metaphysicians
aside, his tales are told of, by, and about the body as a phenomenon. The
noumenal realm is inserted a posteriori by those who would have Kafka's
wounds invoke the divine rather than the Real. To quote again from the
same diary entry (where Kafka quotes from Werfel's play <I>Esther</I>):
"God's masterpieces fart at one another in the bath" (<I>D</I> 319). An
essential mockery and laughter is entailed in the events on the stage of
the world. If we can take Gustav Janouch at his word, Kafka's saying,
there is hope, plenty of hope, just not for us, but for God, then why
couldn't farting be the discourse we own, our freedom of speech?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dominant readings of Kafka have dwelt on his pervasive obsession with
guilt (father-son, employer-employee, native-alien) and have associated
his genius with shame. In this context his radical performativity is
also elided, for shame is fundamentally performative--communal, public,
relational--in a way that guilt typically is not. A truly radical reading
of Kafka, then, must underscore the equally important (if not <I>more</I>
important) interest in the performance of a collective shame--a shame that
includes his own. "In the Penal Colony," notorious for its description
of the inscription of sin and redemption directly upon the flesh of the
condemned, is a document of shame written upon the body politic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of Kafka, as told by literary historians and as embedded in
the popular imagination, perfectly embodies Northrop Frye's descriptive
poetics of pathos. We tend to read it as God's pathetic narrative. Note
how in encyclopedia entries and book jacket blurbs alike Kafka's story
is consistently conflated with that of Josef K--"a tragedy basted with
pathos"--with apologies made for any hint of his "social affability."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Forcing the author into a sort of irresistible victimhood, we have made
  him, pace Sander Gilman, society's patient. But Kafka was no thorough
  hermit; he was intimate with the most outspoken members of Prague's
  social scene. His affair with Milena Jesensk&aacute; was not a staid
  courtship with a retiring and discreet young lady but a tumultuous
  affair with one of Prague's most noteworthy citizens. Milena was but
  one of his

<B></B>

liberated lovers, a "new woman" and a socialist as well. A pioneering and
politically radical journalist, the pomp of Jesensk&aacute;'s aristocratic
pedigree was matched by her desire to sully it. Dora Dymant, Kafka's
last lover, was also, by no accident, a socialist activist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hannah Arendt has said that what concerned Kafka most was not metaphysical
justice or absolute moral requirement but "a world constructed by people,
in which the actions of man depend on nothing but himself and his own
spontaneity and in which human society is ruled by laws established
by men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  In underlining his humanity, she subverts the image that has dominated
  his reception from the inception of his friendship with Brod. Kundera
  takes Brod to task, in the essay "The Castrating Shadow of Saint
  Garta," for the dissemination of the sanctified Kafka image (<I>TB</I>
  35-53).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  But it is not Brod's culpability in an inchoate crime that matters most
  here. There is a humanism that we can attribute to Kafka's "laughter":
  though qualified by God's ironies, Kafka's humor indicts and comforts
  laterally; it is concerned with "us." It is in this engagement with the
  human condition, and the use of irony to illuminate this condition, that
  Kafka ranks with the likes of Shakespeare. His ironic humor is directed
  at the social order and individual claims in that order. His sympathetic
  irony does not alienate; it supports a restoration of human compassion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Irony frequently enters scenes of pathos in Kafka's work. His "heroes"
are scorned and isolated, then suddenly and inexplicably embraced and
adored, often by individuals who are scorned or isolated themselves. The
intense longing he shows for affection ironically thrusts him further
away from the object of his desire (recall the acute longing Gregor Samsa
expresses for the photograph of the woman in fur). The officer is finally
freed--neither transcendentally nor immanently but <I>actually</I> by the
machine that he adores in his explanation, "Guilt," as in Kafka's world,
"is never to be doubted."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's reading of "In the Penal Colony" and its body in pain are
informed by a modernist mission and he places more emphasis on guilt
(interiority) than on shame (exteriority). The exquisite wounds carved
on the soldier become a battleground between "those in power" and those
subservient to it. The inscription in the flesh is a portal to the
discovery of one's own (perhaps universal) guilt:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

an archaic apparatus . . . engraves ornate letters on the backs of guilty
men, multiplying the cuts and increasing the ornamentation to the point
where the back of the guilty man becomes clairvoyant, able itself to
discover the writing from whose letters it must learn the name of its
unknown guilt. It is, then, the back upon which this is incumbent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet an alternate reading can employ the same descriptors to a variant
conclusion. If the project of those in power is to fix the language of the
Law onto the body of its citizens, to make it legible, Kafka's is to force
this eminent "legibility" into "overexposure," which then "blocks every
essay of interpretation." The struggle for signification--the officer's
and the reader's--is laughable. What better language to defy paradigmatic
signification than that of bodily praxis? This code of gesture, of bodily
signs and postures, is Kafka's foremost language. It is one Benjamin
not only noticed, praised, and analysed, but also criticized for its
sometimes pathetic essentialism in his 1934

<B></B>

essay on the significance of the Kafkan gesture. For him, the allegory of
Kafka's tales cannot be apprehended through the conventional complex of
symbolic correspondences: Kafka's artistic force and vision lie within
the "codex of gestures" and it is from here any understanding of his
work must begin. The codex of gestures is one necessarily located in
the body; no surprise then that Kafka is so concerned with the body's
material potential for pain, wounding, breakage, and amputation. Pain,
wounding, and decampment of the body are natural, if extreme, issues of a
desire to restore the body to memory--to re-member the body--that recalls
Benjamin's phrase, "the most forgotten alien land is one's own body."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Benjamin senses a failure unspectacular in Kafka's gestural lexicon:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the mirror which the prehistoric world held before him in the form of
guilt [Kafka] saw the future emerging in the form of a judgment. But he
did not say what it was like. Kafka could understand things <I>only</I>
in the form of a <I>gestus,</I> but he could not understand this
<I>gestus</I> itself. In Kafka, narrative thus regains the significance
it had in the mouth of Scheherazade: to postpone the future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But this failure to unravel the full meaning of the <I>gestus</I> is the
crucial moment of his postmodernity and as such the "procedure seems to
us much more subversive than the usual modernist one, because the latter,
by not showing the Thing, leaves open the possibility of grasping [its]
central emptiness"--a process much more terrifying and liberating,
and perhaps joyful, than the exposure of lack alone (<I>LA</I>
144-5). For Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka is less interested in
"presenting the image of an unknowable law" than in "dissecting the
mechanism" of the machines that use the idea of Law to set themselves
in motion. "Because it has no object of knowledge," the machine is not
the Law; "the law is operative only in being stated and stated only
in the act of punishment: a statement directly inscribed on the real,
on the body and the flesh."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The punishment inscribed on the victim's flesh is a practical
  application of the Law, a shaming. Transcendence, proscribed or
  anticipated, has less to do with the sacrosanct character of the Law
  than with its vacuous need to be made meaningful by such gestures.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pleasure the officer receives from his machine is well suited to
the relish with which he describes it to the explorer; the story is as
much about the ritual violence of <I>language</I> as the ritual violence
of <I>punishment</I>:

"I don't know," said the officer, "if the Commandant has already
explained this apparatus to you." [. . .] "It consists, as you see,
of three parts. In the course of time each of these parts has acquired
a kind of popular nickname. The lower one is called the Bed, the upper
one the Designer and this one here in the middle that moves up and down
is called the Harrow. ["IPC" 193]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The apparatus itself is compared, ironically, to instruments of
healing--"You will have seen similar apparatuses in hospitals; but in our
Bed the movements are all precisely calculated" ("IPC" 196)--and we can
be certain that Kafka's ironic insertion is not lost on us. The apparatus
<I>is</I> meant to heal. But it cannot: the machine of interpretation
fails and succeeds simultaneously. Kafka's narrative keeps the wound open.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The practice of circumcision and the archaic and ornate instruments used
to write one's faith on one's body are not thematically distant from
Kafka's ironized machinery of interpretation. As inscriptions on the body
are marks of community, so one's "guilt" (understood as the aftereffect
of a transgression) may be written on the body as shame. While alienating
one from the community one has betrayed, wounds inflicted by the machine
of the Law on the individual body underscore the individual's essential
communal existence. Inscriptions on the body, that alien territory,
are designed to reconcile the individual with his community; but this
gestural language of community, written quite literally <I>on the
body,</I> individual and social, has forgotten its significance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For all the guilt in Kafka's tale--and this may be a function of the
explorer's role as witness and the narrative's tone--there is also a deep
sense of the power, putatively "healing" and hygienic, of shame. After
all, the prisoner, and ultimately, the officer-<I>cum</I>-victim,
are meant to learn their transgression by reading it upon their back,
a feat possible only through the sense of touch, not vision:

Many questions were troubling the explorer, but at the sight of the
prisoner he asked only: "Does he know his sentence?" "No," said the
officer, eager to go on with his exposition, but the explorer interrupted
him, "He doesn't know the sentence that has been passed on him?" "No,"
said the officer again, pausing a moment as if to let the explorer
elaborate his question, and then said: "There would be no point in
telling him. He'll learn it on his body." ["IPC" 197]

Knowledge (and self-knowledge) is penetrative and rapaciously violating.

The import of the body in dialogue also helps explain the frequency
of nakedness in Kafka's tales. For obvious reasons, the prisoner must
be naked to have his crime inscribed onto his body, but the nakedness
of the officer, prior to his "self-sacrifice," stands in a different
relation to the machine of Law than does the practical assignment of
the prisoner's naked body:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In spite of the obvious haste with which he was discarding first his
uniform and then all his clothing, he handled each garment with loving
care, he even ran his fingers caressingly over the silver lace on the
jacket and shook a tassel into place. This loving care was certainly out
of keeping with the fact that as soon as he had a garment off he flung
it at once with a kind of unwilling jerk into the pit. ["IPC" 220]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer's ritualized striptease is uncannily funny--in each gesture
of the shedding of the garment lies the significance of the rite. The
officer performs his last act as

<B></B>

though on stage for an audience long gone (the ladies' gift of stale
handkerchiefs comes instead of their presence). His reabsorption into the
machine is literally equivalent to writing his own finale, the "Be just"
sign on his body is a desperate and violent way to return the body into
the communal realm, and so to restore community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But something goes terribly wrong: "The Harrow was not writing, it was
only jabbing, and the Bed was not turning the body over but only bringing
it up quivering against the needles. The explorer wanted to do something,
if possible to bring the whole machine to a standstill, for this was no
exquisite torture such as the officer desired, this was plain murder"
("IPC" 224). And it is now that the machinery lives a life of its own,
apparently also struggling to fulfill its duty to the Law: "The Harrow
tried to move back to its old position, but as if it had itself noticed
that it had not yet got rid of its burden it stuck after all where it was,
over the pit" (ibid.). The explorer races to help but it is too late:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And here, almost against his will he had to look at the face of the
corpse. It was as it had been in life; no sign was visible of the promised
redemption; what the others had found in the machine the officer had
not found; the lips were firmly pressed together, the eyes were open,
with same expression as in life, the look was calm and convinced,
through the forehead went the point of a great iron spike. ["IPC" 224-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Penetrative knowledge indeed, but not exquisite transcendence. The tale's
conclusion is anticlimactic, but this suits a reading of inscription--all
writing and reading--as violent. The explorer returns to the "teahouse"
where he finds the grave of the Old Commandant. The laborers there
push their chairs aside, as though changing sets, so that the hidden
gravestone's inscription becomes visible. The explorer's suppliant pose
as he reads--Kafka's language of gestures again--indicates an impulse
to knowledge that is choreographed by power relations:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was a simple stone, low enough to be covered by a table. There was an
inscription on it in very small letters, the explorer had to kneel down
to read it. This was what it said: "Here rests the old Commandant. His
adherents, who now must be nameless, have dug this grave and set up
this stone. There is a prophecy that after a certain number of years
the Commandant will rise again and lead his adherents from this house
to recover the colony. Have faith and wait!" ["IPC" 226]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bystanders meet the inscription with amusement. The explorer only
restores the table and departs. What are we to make of this final
inscription in a story of the violence of inscription? The violence of
the prophecy written in stone, the body of the world, is clear. But
even the promise of final judgment--the future itself--is written in
the body of the world, buried, hidden, and ridiculed (as it is written,
so it shall be). The violence of living it out is inescapable: "They
could have jumped in the boat but the explorer lifted a heavy knotted
rope from the floor boards, threatened them with it, and so kept them
from attempting the leap" ("IPC" 227). The inscription virtually written
into the earth in this alien territory is left to be articulated. The
ferryman rows off with the explorer.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The conclusion allows nothing of the penal colony on board the departing
ship. The officer has been stilled forever in the machine as the
explorer is trapped forever in his alterity (home is not a possibility)
and the historical narrative of the island's inhabitants written in
the Old Commandant's gravestone. With the final--suspended--gesture of
departure, "In the Penal Colony" is about only itself, resisting symbolic
"interpretation" and underscoring the territorial (bodily) violation of
the machine. Conventional, sanctifying, readings of Kafka have long made
metaphors of his life and works. Yet he begs to be read by the body, to
be felt like the spike through the forehead. Whose back fails to arch
(involuntarily) as the machine inscribes its Law? But as gruesomely
performative as the narrative is, it is also funny at the gut-level. The
reader is caught in a community of convulsion and comedy, not unlike
Kafka himself was caught standing in the shadows of the Yiddish theater,
unmindfully slapping his thigh in laughter. The reader abandons the colony
with the explorer, orphaning the story to a fatal distillation--but not
without a final incredulous laugh from Kafka's Sarah at the irony of
this ineluctable end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From impressionism to futurism to surrealism and beyond, the avant-garde
movements of the twentieth century seem to share a rigidly oppositional
logic. These antagonistic programs are united in their efforts to
construct authority against and through the rival claims of each
other. For each, the attempt to establish a certain authenticity, a new
perspective, a transcendent consciousness depends upon the presence of
some fallen other, some decadent or marked double. Indeed, as argued
by critics from Walter Benjamin to Rita Felski, it is this oppositional
logic that informs the avant-garde's tendency toward violence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Avant-gardism is all too easily aligned with imperialism, with
  discourses of racial and cultural superiority, of progress and
  evolutionary advance. Similarly, it often exhibits an aggressive
  chauvinism, a hostile and repressive attitude toward the cultural
  markers of the feminine. Moreover, it is precisely this oppositional
  logic that links the avant-garde with totalitarian politics. The
  aesthetic and fascist movements of the early twentieth century are
  united in their celebration of violent renewal, by their faith in an
  aesthetic transcendence of the fallen world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  What needs to be realized, however, is that these movements, both
  aesthetic and political, tend to abandon the conventional terms
  of tyranny--order, control, stasis--for a dialectic between stasis
  and change, regulation and revolt. In other words, what defines the
  aesthetic politics of the period is a <I>romantic</I> metaphysic in
  which authority exists only by way of dissent, the center by way of
  margins, the self in and through the other. As the romantic

<B></B>

artist evokes a creative struggle of work and world, the nation
establishes itself through "war, the world's only hygiene."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  Importantly, as Russell Berman and Andrew Hewitt have argued, these
  violent dialectics move us beyond specific aesthetic and political
  regimes to a much more pervasive influence. The conflation of order and
  progress helps to affirm a specific economy. For both art and politics,
  only within the bourgeois struggle for significance is any significance
  possible--individual, national, or historical. A romantic aesthetic,
  as it is diffused throughout the social order, offers ontological
  stability to a culture driven by market relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

The British avant-garde, however, needs to be explored as part of a
larger national reaction to both bourgeois liberalism and the successive
invasions of romantic modernism from the continent. Artists such as
T. E. Hulme, Lewis, and Ezra Pound found themselves in the peculiar
position of needing to be modern after the modern had, in some ways,
already occurred. The value of their work, as they saw it, was its
recognition of the collusion between romanticism and reification. Modern
society, they argued, may now exhibit an unprecedented state of freedom,
but it has never experienced a greater standardization. Thus, throughout
<I>Blast</I>, Wyndham Lewis argues that the aesthete and the average
man have grown indistinguishable; chaos and conformity work together
to destroy social integrity. He laments a seemingly free world given
over to mechanical progress and ceaseless faddism, a world in which
"there is no revolt, it is the normal state."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In response to this state of affairs, the British avant-garde turned
  to classicism. For them, classicism represented an artistic and social
  integrity, one that eschews bourgeois individualism and foregrounds
  the material tensions that define and delimit individuals, classes,
  and nations. The classical aesthetic, particularly in its more tragic
  aspects, begins with the chaotic energy of the romantic spirit,
  but subject and object exist in a dynamic tension that restricts the
  tendency of either to spin out of control. Worldly forces restrain and
  refine each other, producing a balanced order that is at once fluid
  and formal. The classical work of art expresses as it reinforces
  these tensions, and thus serves to halt, clarify, and redirect the
  violent production (and reproduction) of the world. It reveals as it
  challenges the material constraints of the individual and his seemingly
  free activity. In Hulme's famous formulation, "The classical poet never
  forgets this finiteness, this limit of man. He remembers always that
  he is mixed up with earth. He may jump, but he always returns back; he
  never flies away into the circumambient gas." Similarly, the classical
  work of art foregrounds discursive limitations, the symbolic coordinates
  of the individual. Again, Hulme, in his essays on political conversion,
  argues, "Beliefs are not only representations, they are also forces,
  and it is possible for one view to compel you to accept it in spite
  of your preference for another."

I hope to show that many feminists at this time, attuned to the material
and discursive structures that shape experience, turned to classicism
as a viable form of aesthetic politics. For these activists, classicism
functioned as a critique and alternative to the oppositional logic of the
avant-garde and modernity at large. Classical art spoke to the creative
tensions between the private and the public, the fallen and the pure,
worldly praxis and the work of art. Specifically, though, feminists
adopted and adapted the

<B></B>

principles of classical ritual. For them, ritual explicitly united
action and symbol, the body and its representation, and thus became
an important tool with which to reconre the terms of culturally
inscribed power. It was neither static nor reactionary, but served as a
continuous argument, a constant construction and reconstruction of those
categories that govern the social. To borrow from Jacques Ranci&egrave;re,
this form of protest can be defined as a "process of subjectivization,"
in which the individual, made <I>subject</I> to others, achieves a
provisional identity. According to Ranci&egrave;re, subjectivization is
"the formation of a one that is not a self but is the relationship of
a self to an other." For militants, this process not only established
their presence within the public sphere, but revealed the extent to
which women participated in those processes whereby subject positions
are produced and maintained. More specifically, Ranci&egrave;re argues
that, for the disempowered, subjectivization entails an "enactment"
or "demonstration" of ideal identities and positions. Insofar as this
"enactment" exposes the conditional nature of authority, it confounds
and subverts the traditional relations of power.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  For the modern militant, that performance was directed at the
  foundational principles of the bourgeois public sphere, both its
  self-serving discourse of "equality" and its exclusionary construction
  of "universality." In the words of Janet Lyon, militant ritual, like
  the manifesto form, reconceived politics as "political dramaturgy" in
  which "the concept of universal equality is not a property available
  to particular groups of people, nor a coherent ideal, but rather a
  <I>logic</I> to be used in arguments that test the viability of the
  distribution of equality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Ultimately, women writers and activists defined the social as a
  ceaselessly creative medium, one that conditions, and is conditioned
  by, multiple identities and relations. The individual, through ritual
  performance, was able to grasp and reshape the possibilities that
  limited her experience. According to Jane Ellen Harrison, suffragette
  and classicist, "Life is doomed to make for itself moulds, break them,
  remake them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  The relationship between the individual and her society is a single,
  conscious continuum, one in which "the soul is like a bird caught in
  a cage, caught and recaught ever in new births. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The sections of this essay, then, explore the politics of classicism
as well as the relation between feminist thinkers and modernism in
general. In suffrage protest, Harrison's anthropology, and H.D.'s poetry
we find a charged matrix of worldly and aesthetic praxes. Each posits
human desire as the basis of expression, and thus each finds in ritual
a medium at once vital and static, affective and conscious. For these
activists, ritual practice both activates and defines subjects in relation
to one another. It functions as part of a generative process in which
a community as a whole can create and understand its condition. The
following three sections, however, differ in their position along
a single continuum; the essay moves from political protest to ritual
performance to the written word. The first section offers protest at its
most explicitly physical, the latter at its most textual. In this manner,
I hope to dramatize not simply the differences between these forms of
activity, but the ways in which social praxis exists as both cause and
effect of all aesthetic activity. I seek to uncover the political aspects
of what are often criticized as the most rarefied and escapist forms of
modern literature. According to Harrison, the stages of social praxis are
"life with its motor

<B></B>

reactions, the ritual copy of life with its faded reactions, the image
of the god projected by the rite, and, last, the copy of that image,
the work of art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  For the scholar and her feminist cohorts, it was precisely this
  continuum that countered the oppressive logic of modernity and its
  avant-garde.

"Deeds, not words!"--a fitting motto for the militant suffrage
movement. From protests, pageants, and fisticuffs to sabotage, smuggling,
and arson, deeds defined the movement from beginning to end. For women
who had been effectively barred from public life, action was imperative
and struggle a goal. Members argued that "revolt is a great and glorious
thing in itself" and drew little distinction between "the joy of battle
and the exultation of victory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  But, despite these claims, one cannot deny the spectacular, performative
  aspects of the campaign. Firsthand accounts reveal that punches
  and kicks were often only suggested or mimed. In fact, one of the
  very first "deeds" was nothing more than an imitation of spitting;
  as Christabel Pankhurst explained, "It was not a real spit but only,
  shall we call it, a pout, a perfectly dry purse of the mouth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Often, suffragettes would tie stones to their wrists or wrap them in
  paper so that, when tossed, they would not cause material damage. Axes
  rarely fell, bricks dropped limply, and flags would poke into open
  windows and doors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Tellingly, militants defined themselves as a "stage army" and labored
  under the knowledge that she "Who takes the eye takes all!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  According to Lisa Tickner, these forms of demonstration were understood
  as "a way of living the abstract relations and demands of politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  Militants were well aware of the power won through representation,
  and therefore focused their efforts upon the symbolic. Thus, as I hope
  to show here, the movement ultimately attests to a mutuality of deeds
  <I>and</I> words, and the ability of such to transform the public
  sphere. Militants sought not only to exploit this mutuality, but to
  posit it as the basis of an alternative, intersubjective community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any history of the suffrage movement, however, must begin with the fact
that militants consistently defined their cause in opposition to the
attitudes and values of the Liberal Party. Their campaign moved well
beyond the issue of the vote; its force and appeal lay in a much wider
attack on a complex matrix of individualism, free trade, progress,
and machinery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Countless statements and speeches made by militants denounced the flat,
  frictionless world of Liberalism, the standardized chaos of bourgeois
  individualism. Moreover, they critiqued the presumed consensus of the
  rational public sphere, which could only obscure and uphold specifically
  masculine interests. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, for example, criticized
  Liberals for conceiving freedom as an "ideal only of opposition,
  of vested interests, of inertia, and of prejudice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Dora Montefiore argued that Herbert Asquith "is against the women
  because they are for peace and he is on the side of the capitalist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  As Lyon has argued, it was precisely this critique that aligned the
  militant with the British avant-garde. The militant's disgust with the
  "sluggish respectability of the 'plain man'" clearly echoed Lewis's
  attack on the "abysmal inexcusable middle-class."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Aptly, she defines this unity as a "shared

<B></B>

sense of deep disappointment that the promises for radical change
. . . had in fact been co-opted by the modern instrumental status quo"
(<I>M</I>, 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was in opposition to this seemingly rational order that militants
developed their strategy, particularly its materialist emphasis. For
Emmeline Pankhurst and her followers, history had taught that reasoned
argument would only delay change and protect the status quo, while efforts
to raise public sympathy proved nothing more than regressive. Thus,
throughout the campaign, militants focused upon the effective power of
the physical, what they called life's "hard and cruel facts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  In her famous address at Hartford, for example, Pankhurst describes her
  work as an attempt "to bring enough pressure to bear upon the government
  to compel them to deal with the question of woman suffrage." She
  argues that "it is not by making people comfortable you get things
  in practical life, it is by making them uncomfortable." As a whole,
  the movement measured effectiveness in terms of size, strength, and
  duration. Protests and pageants maximized pressure and discomfort
  upon civic surroundings. A turn to arson and vandalism sought wider
  and more lasting effects. As Pankhurst told her audience, "You have
  to make more noise than anybody else, you have to fill all the papers
  more than anybody else, in fact you have to be there all the time and
  see that they don't snow you under, if you are really going to get
  your reform realized."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, this materialism was aligned with decisively antiproductivist
and antiprogressivist attitudes. Militant activity typically slowed
and retarded social machinery. Opponents dismissed most tactics as mere
nuisances--scraping golf greens, painting over house numbers, home and
prison blockades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  But larger maneuvers--refusing the census, cutting down communication
  lines, and a rather peculiar week of self-denial--began to
  reveal a pattern. These acts of insurgency replaced the passion
  and violence of romantic revolution within conscious strategies of
  obstruction. According to Pankhurst, the most effective policies worked
  to create "a very paralyzing situation. . . . an impossible situation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  Thus, upon entering the streets, militants sought to impede civic
  flows. One observer acknowledged that "More and more it became difficult
  to belittle the movement . . . which could hold up the traffic of
  London with processions two or three miles long, and decked from end
  to end with hundreds of banners, some of them of vast size. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Similarly, in breaking shopwindows and cutting down communication lines,
  militants halted the flows of the market. Their leader explained that
  "in this effort to rouse business men . . . we entirely prevented
  stock brokers in London from telegraphing stock brokers in Glasgow,
  and vice versa; for one whole day telegraphic and telecommunication
  was entirely stopped."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Most radically, in hunger striking, militants interfered with the
  activity of the female body itself. This weapon, the "weapon of
  self-hurt," helped not only to generate sympathy for the cause, but
  to bring "great pressure" upon an otherwise smoothly functioning nation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  As Jane Marcus explains, "When woman, quintessential nurturer,
  refuses to eat, she cannot nurture the nation" (<I>SP,</I> 1-2,
  339). Militants thus "withheld their consent" from what was considered
  their most important role in a social economy defined precisely in
  terms of ceaseless production and consumption.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, militants consistently valorized restraint. According to
the leaders of the movement, "our words have always been, 'be patient,
exercise self-restraint, show our so-called superiors that the criticism
of women being hysterical is not true. . . .'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  On the one hand, this emphasis countered misconceptions about the
  supposedly hysterical female body. Lyon points out that a "discourse
  of anti-sentimentality and pure objectivity" provided access to
  "universalizing discourses that had been formative in the historical
  exclusion of women. . ." (<I>M</I>, 116). But, as important, restraint
  red as a powerful antidote to a dissipated liberal community. In
  <I>The Great Scourge and How to End It,</I> for example, Christabel
  Pankhurst presents sexual restraint as a positive quality that both
  clarifies and increases human potential. The militant argues that the
  current spread of sexual disease can be directly attributed to the loose
  values of liberal society; sexual free trade and rampant reproduction
  have worked together to destroy a once healthy nation. "Men whose
  will-power fails them," she laments, "are constantly infecting and
  reinfecting the race with vile disease, and so bringing about the
  downfall of the nation!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  In this context of bodily and national dissipation, Pankhurst outlines
  a metaphysics of restraint. As in the most radical modernist work, she
  provides an intriguing economy of energy and restriction, strength and
  intellect. Reversing gendered tropes, Pankhurst argues that excessive
  male sexuality leads only to physical distress and irritability.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Incontinence res as "a waste of vital force which impoverishes
 [men's] moral nature and weakens their body." She contends that passion
 "ought to lie dormant until legitimate occasion arises for its use,
 when it will be found to exist in full natural vigour" (<I>GS,</I>
 60-1). This dynamic system extends well beyond the body to
 incorporate other practices and values. Pankhurst turns to the intellect
 and praises the "active man who directs his energies more to his brain
 and muscles than to his sensual nature" (<I>GS,</I> 59). She even
 offers a radical aesthetic theory, one we will find echoed in the work
 of Harrison and H.D. She boldly concludes that "Art is creative. Sexual
 excess is a waste of man's creative energy" (<I>GS,</I> 127).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This very logic--in its emphasis on materiality, control,
and clarity--also informs the representational strategies of
militancy. Insofar as women found their efforts hampered by stereotypes
and standards, they focused their attacks upon the discursive. As Cicely
Hamilton notes,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Like nearly all girls of my generation I was bred in the idea that my
duty and advantage was to conform to the masculine ideal of womanhood;
this or that exercise of habit was forbidden because it clashed with

a tradition--spoken or half-spoken--it was a constant influence on our
thoughts and a constant director of our energies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, Hamilton equates her turn toward feminism with a
growing suspicion of male constructed ideals and symbols, to which the
female body was meant to conform. As she explains, "I became a feminist
on the day I perceived that--according to the story--[a girl's] 'honour'
was not a moral but a physical quality. Once that was clear to me my
youthful soul rebelled. . ." (ibid.). Similarly, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence

<B></B>

argues that "The world as we know it today is ruled by law, by custom,
and by public opinion, and women are beginning to realize that it is
a man-made world in the deepest sense of the word." For her, feminism
struggled against a world in which "there is nothing that expresses the
woman's point of view. There is nothing that tallies with the woman's
soul . . . everything is arranged on a plan different from their own,
and upon a system which has taken no account of their point of view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  One cannot overemphasize, however, that these experiences allowed
  feminists to recognize and thus focus their attack upon the material
  aspects of language. Militants adopted an aggressive symbolism, one
  committed to manipulating the effective potential of the sign. They
  fully welcomed the spectacular, using pageants, publications, and
  speeches in order to control and manipulate the process of their
  signification. As Tickner asserts, "The raison d'&ecirc;tre of the
  suffragette movement was the campaign for the vote but one of the
  aims that motivated its supporters . . . was the legitimizing of
  new representations of women. Or, more precisely, the contesting,
  modifying and restructuring of representations of women already in
  circulation or in the process of emerging" (<I>SW</I>, 172).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several scholars have already explored the narratives and symbols of
suffrage discourse and the manner in which they helped to shape new
female identities and communities. Barbara Green, Mary Jean Corbett,
and Caroline J. Howlett have each examined how even the most unique
feminist experiences would inspire imitators, thereby influencing and
informing other subjectivities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Most suffrage statements, Green argues, "take up the performative
  nature of identity, revealing how feminist identities are produced
  through constant reiteration or performance." She adds that even "many
  of the seemingly less dramatic writings and speeches of suffrage also
  functioned in ways that constructed an oppositional identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  Significantly, militant "experience" always occurred within a conscious
  performative loop, one in which origins and repetitions seemed to blur,
  lost in the infinite process of reiteration. By performing certain
  values or identities in public, militants inevitably called them into
  being. In the words of Pethick-Lawrence, "While working for the idea
  of political liberty, we were individually achieving liberty of a far
  more real and vital nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  The most radical example of this reiterative process was Lady Constance
  Lytton's masquerade as the fictional Jane Warton. Hoping to publicize
  the hypocrisy of the legal system, Lytton disguised herself as a
  lower-class militant and was forcibly fed in prison. Her account of
  the affair and its aftermath suggests that even the most personal,
  incommunicable aspects of her experience contained performative,
  mimetic qualities. As she writes, "To think that I who have endured
  by far the least of all the 'forcibly fed' should be making people
  wake up more than all of them. . . . It is the other more heroic and
  first ones who have really done what I <I>seem</I> to have done."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Lytton's example, it becomes clear how difficult it is to separate
the militants' active and representational strategies. Throughout the
campaign, the militant body functioned as the site of both work and
signification. While its force was inevitably expressive, its expression
released implacable forces. Deeds and words combined in an aggressive
struggle against the cultural inscriptions of power. "The argument of the
broken pane" was perhaps the most explicit realization of this unity. In
a seemingly

<B></B>

random series of attacks on nonpartisan shops and offices, suffragettes
did their best to assert female power and make Londoners very
"uncomfortable." The attacks, however, also gave expression to the
interconnectedness of private and public spheres, particularly as that
link was informed by economics. The protest, and others of its kind,
spoke from within a dynamic matrix of power. In fact, Emmeline Pankhurst's
speeches described with increasing confidence her position within this
larger network. As she told one audience,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Conversely, verbal protest tended to heighten and expose reservoirs of
oppositional power. The interruption of speech evoked previously hidden
hostility from the status quo. By shouting at government meetings,
dinner parties, sporting events, and theater performances, suffragettes
not only asserted their right to participate in a discursive order,
but also heightened, and thereby gave expression to, problems that had
previously been hidden within that order. Thus, Pankhurst was able to
argue that one of the most effective militant acts consisted of nothing
more than a question. For asking a question, just as men would have
asked it, "girls were treated with violence and flung out of the meeting;
and when they held a protest meeting in the street they were arrested,
and were sent to prison, one for a week as a common criminal, and the
other for three days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This conflation of deeds and words, power and knowledge, was most
compellingly expressed in the popular slogan "You are an argument."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  In fact, it informed the militants' conception of suffrage. Pankhurst
  understood the vote as both "a symbol. . . . a symbol of freedom,
  a symbol of citizenship, a symbol of liberty" and "an instrument,
  something with which you can get a great many more things. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Most intriguingly, this intense dualism can be detected in
  Pethick-Lawrence's understanding of the law. In one of her most famous
  speeches, she defines the law as a contingent process, a changing
  matrix of force and form. She claims that "In common we have felt
  the compulsion of this Law that has brought us into association
  together and has made us part of a living pattern, woven by destiny
  in the loom of Time, to a rhythm and rune which is making the world's
  story." Echoing Christabel Pankhurst, Pethick-Lawrence defines the law
  as the result of multiple pressures and demands. It is simultaneously
  revealed and transformed by the tensions that exist between various
  subjective positions. In fact, she argues "it is by the very enemy and
  the betrayer that the law is accomplished and destiny fulfilled." One
  cannot ignore the speaker's romantic excesses, but she consistently
  subsumes her mysticism within the material world. The rhythms of force
  and form are the rhythms of history. Power is made known only because
  it is contingent and immanent: it is both experienced and understood
  through the "material substance of things," "our own bodies."

Ultimately, militancy abandoned the modern valorization of the individual
for a more closely integrated community. It critiqued the myth of
the universal subject and the empty abstractions of representational
politics in order to explore the social as a modality of various
interests and desires. The bourgeois public sphere and its seemingly
rational laws, paradoxically constructed upon principles of exclusion
and noninterference, were rejected in favor of what appeared to be
more fluid processes of exchange and mediation. Perhaps, then, the
importance of the movement exists in its awareness that modern politics
are essentially <I>negative</I> in character, founded upon the belief
that the "individual" must <I>not</I> be encroached upon. In response,
it proposed a community that was radically positive, based upon a
constructive or creative interaction between its constituents. Of course,
community of this kind does not imply ideological freedom; the continuous
negotiation of power denies the possibility of a stable, transcendent
position from which that power can be clearly evaluated. Nevertheless,
this proposed community implies a point of access from which to grasp and
perhaps reconre specific relations. According to Pethick-Lawrence,
the individual does not exist apart from the "living pattern" and only
achieves "human consciousness" within that pattern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  It is precisely this positive sense of the limited and the contingent
  that defines modern classicism and its power for feminist thinkers. Jane
  Ellen Harrison explored this collective mode as it existed in suffrage
  protest as well as the more formalized realm of ancient ritual. Her
  work argues that power relations can be radically transred by the
  performance of public rites.

Perhaps in order to avoid charges of deviancy, and as a testament to
their intellect and learning, suffragettes often borrowed from the art
of classical antiquity. They would frequently mimic the gestures and
attitudes of the Greek heroines, their pristine strength, grace, and
justice. This turn to antiquity, however, also implies an awareness that
militant protest--in its imagery, organization, and publicity--recalled
ancient transformative rites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Participants often dressed in the robes of ministrants or supplicants,
  and often formalized their practical, everyday activities. Memoirs
  and narratives frequently reveal "saints," "martyrs," and even "an
  overblown Adelphi heroine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  Similarly, service was interpreted as a process of suffering and
  redemption, death and rebirth. According to Mary Gordon, the average
  militant was "seized and used. She was both flame and burnt offering."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  However, it would be left to a trained scholar of antiquity to
  explain the modern politics of ancient ritual. Jane Ellen Harrison,
  self-proclaimed feminist, suffragette, and anthropologist, offers
  an explicit account of the feminist turn to classical practice. Her
  work moves away from an ideological vision of enlightened antiquity
  in order to celebrate the material activity of the ancient masses. It
  redefines the public sphere by emphasizing the desiring body and its
  ability to enact law. Harrison's work offers a serious challenge to
  the oppositional logic of the avant-garde and modernity in general,
  as it more fully links deed and word within a single ritualized praxis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's <I>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion</I> looks
beyond the religious myths of fifth-century Greece in order to disclose
the material conditions and motivations of their creators. According
to her, "Some of the loveliest stories the Greeks have left us will
be seen to have taken their rise, not in poetic imagination, but
in primitive, often savage, and I think, always practical ritual"
(<I>P,</I> xvii). This assertion is grounded in the conviction that
every religion is essentially "conditioned by the circumstances of its
worshippers" (<I>P,</I> 85). Myths, gods, divine names and attributes are
but reflections of the mortal world, the material conditions that govern
earthly life. According to her, "the gods are as many as the moods of the
worshipper, i.e. as his thoughts about his gods. If he is kind, they are
Kindly Ones; when he feels vengeful, they are Vengeful Ones" (<I>P,</I>
214). Ultimately, these ideal subjectivities owe their existence to mere
mortals; for Harrison, divine power is alienated human power. In speaking
of women's rites and festivals, she argues that it was the goddess
"who imitated her youths and maidens," and not the reverse (<I>P,</I> 30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's work, however, entails an intriguing ideological critique. She
first turns to the fifth-century and its unique deities, lonesome heroes,
and popular poets. These various incarnations of the divine, she argues,
affirm a social order driven by individualism and commerce. The Greek of
this period--with his carefully departmentalized gods, with his rituals
of "tendance" or exchange--is nothing more than an "archpatriarchal
bourgeois" (<I>P,</I> 285). His rites, his professions, and his
faculties are neatly governed by "ideas of law and order and reason"
(<I>P,</I> 397). More importantly, she criticizes this period for
its immaterialism. Its heroism, she argues, "is for individuals"; such
people "are cut clean from earth and from the local bits of earth out of
which they grew" (<I>AAR,</I> 161). She links this immaterialism with an
excessive pragmatism of language and an attendant violent aestheticism of
the natural world. "Eikonism," she explains, "takes the vague, unknown,
fearful thing, and tries to picture it, picture it as known, distinct,
definite . . . something as far rationalized as man himself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  For her, <I>eikonism</I> implies a desire to control and master that
  which is other; it works to "comprise and confine the god within the
  limitations of the worshipper," affirming his power over the material
  world (<I>P,</I> 258).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison, of course, laments the similar conditions of her own historical
moment, and asks readers to look beyond the affirmative myths of the
heroic age, beyond Homeric individualism and Platonic abstraction. Her
work returns to an even earlier period characterized by an intense
materialism, immanent deities, and sensual rites. Earlier societies
are celebrated for being in "touch with the confusions of actuality"
(<I>P,</I> 215). For these people, fears and joys are never abstract,
but earthly, tangible; they are haunted by the "actual ghost, not a mere
abstract vengeance . . . " (<I>P,</I> 217). Harrison's return to the
material world suggests a return to worldly potential. She asks us to
look beyond the omnipotent godhead to an originally human force, beneath
Olympian abstraction to a primal, chthonic practice. Specifically, she
locates an alternative model of social order and change within ritual
practice, within a performative logic that unites material force and
aesthetic form, bodily desire and abstraction.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much like Pound, Yeats, and Joyce, Harrison places desire at the
center of ritual practice. She claims that most, if not all, rituals
are initiated through passion, the "supreme mysteries of ecstasy and
love." The Eleusinian rite of sacred marriage, for example, cultivates
sensuality as the precondition for the revelation of the divine. "It is
indeed," Harrison writes, "only in the orgiastic religions that these
splendid moments of conviction could come . . . " (<I>P,</I> 568). In
<I>Ancient Art and Ritual,</I> the scholar more specifically argues
that traditional ritual practice focuses on the representation of a
"thing desired" (<I>AAR,</I> 25). Here, she defines ritual as a form
of sympathetic magic, a conscious "mimicking of nature's processes"
(<I>AAR,</I> 129). This magic, she elaborates, begins with the subject's
desire for the return of certain natural events, such as the spring or the
rising of crops. In remembrance of past pleasure and in anticipation of
future power, the participant copies or mimics the conditions under which
these might occur. In seasonal rites, for example, the "savage utters his
intense desire for food." Harrison explains that "His impulse is towards
food. He must eat that he and his tribe may grow and multiply. It is
this that he <I>utters and represents</I> in his rites" (<I>AAR,</I> 65).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Christabel Pankhurst, like H.D., Harrison reveals a bias toward
the creative potential of restraint. In <I>Ancient Art and Ritual,</I>
she explains that the primal unity of desire and representation
is founded upon an inevitable tension or restriction. She offers a
psychological model that presents human constitution not as a bundle of
separate faculties, but as a continuous cycle of activities. Emotion,
perception, and action exist concurrently, in a ceaseless causal loop,
without hierarchy or telos (<I>AAR,</I> 39-40). Harrison, however,
notes that "perception is not always instantly transformed into action;
there is an interval for choice between several possible actions." She
argues that "Perception is pent up and becomes, helped by emotion,
conscious representation." It is only out of this "momentary halt"
in the cycle, this "unsatisfied desire," that "all our mental life,
our images, our ideas, our consciousness, and assuredly our religion
and our art, is built up" (<I>AAR,</I> 41). Thus, through restraint,
Harrison connects desire with the performance or representation of its
fulfillment, linking motive force with expressive form. As she explains:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A rite is . . . a sort of stereotyped action, not wholly practical, but
yet not wholly cut loose from practice, a reminiscence of an anticipation
of actual practical doing; it is fitly, though not quite correctly,
called by the Greeks a dromenon, "a thing done." . . . its mainspring
[is] not the wish to copy nature or even improve upon her . . . but
rather an impulse shared by art with ritual, the desire, that is, to
utter, to give out a strongly felt emotion or desire by representing, by
making or doing or enriching the object or act desired. [<I>AAR,</I> 26]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Harrison, ritual occurs at the interface of desire and restriction,
and thus it exists between the active and the symbolic, the creative
and the intelligible. The ritual participant at once utters and enacts
desire, proclaims and repairs the terms of his or her existence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In some sense, for Harrison, society is always ritualized, seamlessly
shifting between worldly and aesthetic praxes. It ceaselessly combines
<I>dromenon</I> (things done) and <I>drama</I> (performance). She
emphasizes, however, that insofar as desire is

<B></B>

intersubjective, its ritual performance mediates intersubjective
relations. For her, public ritual extends beyond the expression of
bodily need in order to expose social inequality and disadvantage. In
fact, for Harrison, social status exists only in its performance,
in the part-practical, part-symbolic gestures of public protest. For
the primitive as well as the modern, "one's ritual 'dances' are the
[expression] of one's importance" (<I>AAR,</I> 31). Ritual, however,
does not simply reveal, but shapes social relations; its power is
transformative as well. The ritual participant does "not simply 'embody'
a previously conceived idea, he begets it. From his performance springs
the personification. The abstract idea arises from the only thing it
possibly can arise from, the concrete act" (<I>AAR,</I> 71). Ritual,
much like suffrage spectacle, serves to conceive and thus enact new
modes and relations. The performance of desires arouses the spectator's
desire. Power is perceived in gestures that are then mimicked by the
larger population. More specifically, she contends that ritual first
obstructs the spectator's habitual patterns of behavior. The rite first
halts, then models and channels desire for the community as a whole. These
various stages of mimicry--because conscious--are open to choice and
change. At her most idealistic, Harrison argues that the process is at
once active and thoughtful, infinite and infinitely negotiable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's discussion of the "Thesmophoria" offers the clearest example
of this theory and its political significance. Participants in this rite,
a self-elected group of women, would gather and then lower pigs into deep
clefts outside the village walls. After some time, the women themselves
would descend into the clefts, retrieve the rotten flesh and "place it
on certain altars, whence it was taken and mixed with seed to serve as
a fertility charm" (<I>P,</I> 123). Harrison asserts that the myth of
Demeter and Persephone was only later appended to this rite and thus
obscures its original, sympathetic intention, the mimicking of natural
cycles. But she focuses on the full name of the first deity, Demeter
Thesmophoros, which is translated as "law-carrier" or "law-giver." The
name of the deity, like all such names, is bound to an earlier adjectival
form. Thesmophoros derives from the activity of the earlier ministrants,
the original carrying and laying down of <I>thesmoi</I> or sacred
objects. The goddess who represents the law took her name from the human
ministrants who were "called Thesmophoroi because they carried 'the
things laid down'" (<I>P,</I> 137). For Harrison, this implies that the
law was laid down by the rite; it was based on an earlier "thing done,"
on the ritual gestures of earlier societies. She defends her argument
by pointing out that most ancient rites entailed "things said" as well
as "things done." Words uttered during a sacred performance correspond
to specific gestures and activities (<I>P,</I> 570); they re as an
"avowal of things performed" (<I>P,</I> 156). Harrison argues that ancient
law derives from these vocal components. The ritual creed developed "on
its social side into the ordinance and ultimately into the regular law"
(<I>P,</I> 142). For the ancient Greek, law, ritual, and desire are
inextricably linked. Power is at once symbolic and sensual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I mentioned above, the dynamics of ritual seem to embody what
Ranci&egrave;re calls the "process of subjectivization." Harrison clearly
echoes Ranci&egrave;re when she argues that "many, perhaps most of us,
breathe more freely in the <I>medium,</I> literally the <I>midway</I>
space, of some collective ritual" (<I>AAR,</I> 206). The strength of
this theory, however,

<B></B>

is its avoidance of the binary logic that governs bourgeois
politics. As a "universal transition space," ritual confounds those
dichotomies--the irrational and the rational, the marked and the fallen,
the private and the public--that enforce often gendered conrations
of power. Similarly, Harrison's theory offers a valuable counter to the
logic of the avant-garde. By locating material tensions and restrictions
at the center of representational practice, she confounds the avant-garde
opposition between aesthetic and worldly praxes. While ritual permits
contemplation, it denies the possibility of an autonomous, purposeless
space from which the world may be addressed. In fact, we will find that
the work of art, born of desire, is but "a later and more sublimated,
more detached form of ritual" that yet maintains its social power
(<I>AAR,</I> 225). For Harrison, as for H.D., art is always already
material, purposive, and social. Its beauty is collectively determined,
conditioned by "a keen emotion felt toward things and people living
today. . . " (<I>AAR,</I> 237).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, Harrison's theory grants contemporary women a position from
which to challenge institutional conrations of power. Her work clearly
celebrates an early primitive society defined by female practice. However,
insofar as she defines this practice as the ritual performance of desire,
she accounts for its possible return. In "Homo Sum," she argues that
this return has already taken form as the contemporary struggle for
suffrage. She explains that it was through her studies of antiquity
that she first became receptive to the activity of the militants. The
sexes have always been defined by an "artificial division of moral
industry." The current struggle res as part of a constant inscription
and reinscription of the relationship between the sexes. Harrison,
therefore, celebrates the suffrage movement not as an expression of
essential womanhood, but as a ritualized effort to rewrite the terms of
cultural power. She confirms that militant activity is based on the same
unity of knowing, feeling, and acting that marked ancient ritual. The
militants, she explains, have recognized that "To feel keenly is often,
if not always an amazing intellectual revelation." Their work is based
on an "awakening of the <I>desire,</I>" which is also "the awakening of
the <I>intention to act,</I> to act more efficiently and to shape the
world more completely to our will."

For Susan Stanford Friedman, H.D.'s early work is complicated by its
association with patriarchal attitudes and conservative politics, with the
"totalizing mythos of the reactionary center." Imagism, in particular,
comes under attack as a "critical cage from which the female poet needs
'liberation.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Consequently, Friedman praises H.D.'s turn toward nonrationalist,
  nonmaterialist perspectives in the mystical hermeticism of the later
  poems and novels. The late work is valuable as "a case in point for
  the gendered history of modernism, for the situation of a woman who
  writes out of the position of the Other."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  Although it would be hard to deny H.D.'s romantic tendencies, I contend
  that her work consistently confounds the notion of otherness. If H.D.'s
  poetry gives voice to certain marginal experiences, it emphasizes the
  social tensions that define those experiences. Her verses foreground
  a dynamic intersubjectivity and only

<B></B>

thus entail a certain political, if not explicitly feminist,
engagement. We now turn to a third point on our continuum of deeds and
words, to the most formal mode of engagement, the work of art. H.D.'s
poetry reveals the effective unity of often gendered binaries, such as
subject and object, public and private, work and world. Her ritualized
poetry does not avoid political responsibility; rather, it raises
possibilities for a community that always already incorporates the
marginal, the feminine, and the poetic. As H.D. explained, "My work
is creative and reconstructive, war or no war, if I can get across the
Greek spirit at its highest I am helping the world, and the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For H.D., spirit is always an immanent, effective presence. Her work
celebrates powerful, irrational forces as they both inform and clarify
worldly objects. Thus, while her poetry is infused with a fluid energy,
its images are vibrant and crisp. Its landscapes are at once tangible and
expressive, vital and intelligible. H.D.'s sea flowers, for example, are
caught amidst violent drifts and tides, but it is precisely their openness
to these conditions that lend them their beauty. Subject to elemental
forces, their features turn "hard," "bright," and "fresh." The "marred"
rose and "slashed" reed are "doubly rich" for their torment. Conversely,
these precise forms, in their graceful motions and swift mutations,
suggest the presence of elemental forces. The reed that is "lifted" gives
shape to the wind; "pebbles drift and flung" reveal the motion of the sea.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  In "Sheltered Garden," H.D. explicitly celebrates this charged,
  contingent landscape. The poet first condemns the imaginative excesses
  of romanticism, which re as suffocation, solipsism, and satiety:
  "Beauty without strength," she declares, "chokes out life." Repulsed,
  the poet demands a spare, classical beauty governed by pressure,
  tension, and precision. The speaker turns to violent forces that
  "break," "snap," "scatter," and "fling," and forms that lie "torn" and
  "twisted." A true classicist, she seeks the beauty of a "terrible /
  wind-tortured place" (<I>CP,</I> 19-22).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These aesthetics are based on processes akin to those that inform militant
protest and classical ritual. H.D.'s clear, crystalline images do not
exist in isolation, but are embedded, and indeed result from tensions
within a dynamic field. Their existence is neither spontaneous, isolated,
or permanent, but conditional, resulting from their subjection to larger
forces. H.D. observed that she

grew tired of hearing the poems referred to, as crystalline. . . . For
what is crystal or any gem but the concentrated essence of the rough
matrix, or the energy, either of over-intense heat or over-intense cold
that projects it? The poems as a whole . . . contain that essence or
that symbol, symbol of concentration and of stubborn energy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More importantly, this "energy," insofar as it informs and
shapes the phenomenal world, is decisively human. The winds and
tides of H.D.'s poetry suggest the power of a specifically mortal
force--inspiration--which she conceives as desire itself. From early
poems such as "Pursuit," "The Cliff Temple," and "Eurydice," to the later
"Choros Sequence" and "The Dancer," we find a passionate intensity that
cuts and marks all in its path, leaving its traces on both body and
world. The subject exists in a constant liminal state, between palpable
forces and a formal precision. Her body is subject to

<B></B>

contingent energy from both within and without, and thus grows
powerful as well as acutely sentient. According to Eileen Gregory,
the most remarkable quality of H.D.'s lyrics are their "liminality,"
a constant mediation of "boundaries between inner and outer, between
self and other." Its central qualities are at once "deeply subjective
and radically impersonal . . . they represent deep interiority infusing
in outward shape or motion, making it vibrant and golden."

In the 1920s, H.D. revisited her early classicism and developed a clear
theory of the desiring subject. H.D.'s "Notes on Thought and Vision,"
argues that the subject reaches her full potential only through "definite
physical relations." Sensual activity shapes identity and cultivates
physical as well as intellectual "talents."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  This unity of experience and knowledge finds its clearest expression
  in the image of the "over-mind":

There is, then, a set of super-feelings. These feelings extend
 out and about us; as the long, floating tentacles of the jelly-fish

 as the jelly-fish feelers are the jelly-fish itself, elongated in fine
 threads. (<I>NTV,</I> 19)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Albeit bizarre, H.D.'s image of the over-mind provides a consistent
intersubjective model. The over-mind, subjectivity itself, exists
only in mutuality, in a kinetic coupling that is at once sensuous and
conscious. Moreover, for H.D., this model suggests the possibility of
the subject's empowerment. "The centre of consciousness," she explains,
"is either the brain or the love-region of the body" (<I>NTV,</I>
20). This conflation suggests a faculty that is at once active as well
as perceptive, creative as well as conscious. To illustrate her theory,
she turns to the sacred rites of Eleusis, in which "One must understand
a lower wisdom before one understands a higher" (<I>NTV,</I> 31). The
rites entail a three-step process that moves from "Crude animal enjoyment"
to pure "over-mind consciousness." Physical lovers re as prototypes
for "spiritual lovers," the latter having the power of "concentrating
and directing pictures from the world of vision" (<I>NTV,</I> 50). Like
Harrison, H.D. places desire at the center of her phenomenology. Body and
vision, "seed" and "word," coexist in a single, dynamic process. Thus,
subjection becomes subjectivization, and a position from which to
negotiate power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have seen in our discussion of "Sheltered Garden," H.D. associates
imaginative freedom with solipsism, sensual satiety with suffocation. For
this poet, true creation depends upon the constancy of desire; precision
is the result of restriction or tension. Thus, her work, much like that
of Pankhurst and Harrison, consistently outlines the benefits of bodily
restraint. "Notes on Thought and Vision" repeatedly warns against sexual
fulfillment and consummation. She pleads for chastity, claiming that
the artist can "retard" his powers by "neglect of his body" (<I>NTV,</I>
52). The "love-region," she argues, must remain in a state of constant
excitation, "its energy not dissipated in physical relation" (<I>NTV,</I>
22). Helen Sword's work on the visionary tradition elucidates this logic:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Eros, or desire, in fact signifies an absence so powerful that it takes
on the role of a presence, so that the romantic pairings that generally
characterize human sexuality--dualities, if not always necessarily of
male and female, then at least of lover and beloved, self and an erotic
Other--triangulate into complex constellations that include as a third
party desire itself: eros as a force both motivational and mediatory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sword here locates the expressive power of those boundaries between self
and other. Eros proceeds from the absence of fulfillment, in longing,
in tension and pain. The artist must struggle with and against the other,
and thereby "create the desire that creates poetry" (ibid.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tellingly, it was H.D.'s psychic experiences in Greece that enabled
her to link desire, restraint, and vision. In <I>Tribute to Freud,</I>
the poet recalls how her trip was supposed to culminate with a visit
to Delphi. At Itea, however, she and Bryher were told that "it was
absolutely impossible for two ladies alone, at that time, to make the
then dangerous trip on the winding road to Delphi. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  H.D. dramatically depicts her feelings of restriction and longing, but
  she also suggests that it was precisely these intense sensations that
  inspired her visionary experiences. Unable to visit the oracular seat,
  the poet finds her desire transmuted into oracular signs. Well-versed in
  psychoanalytic theory, she places her projections squarely between the
  wish-inspired dreams of Freud's work and the mystical, otherworldly
  speech of the mystics. Each one can be translated, she argues,
  "as a suppressed desire for forbidden 'signs and wonders'" or "an
  extension of the artist's mind, a <I>picture</I> or an illustrated
  poem, taken out of the actual dream or day-dream content and projected
  from within. . ." (<I>TF,</I> 76). Thus, for H.D., the event is both
  personal and impersonal; the visionary is caught between her intense
  passion and abstract form. One image, she claims, is "so impersonal
  it might have been anyone, of almost any country. And yet there was
  a distinctly familiar line about that head . . . dead brother? Lost
  friend?" (<I>TF,</I> 66). The deity that presides over this hybrid
  experience is none other than the winged Nike. The goddess appears upon
  a ladder, between two realms, the worldly and the divine. For her,
  the image, like those found in her early poetry, is "doubly rich"
  (<I>TF,</I> 83).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
H.D.'s poetry repeatedly returns to this relay of desire, restraint, and
creativity. Her verses are populated by "broken" lovers and distraught
visionaries, whose powers exist only in a passion deferred. "Fragment
Thirty-Six," for example, presents the following, frustrated lament:

The speaker cannot decide whether to seek fulfillment in the arms of a
lover or attenuate and thus transmute her passion into the clear words
of song. Masterfully, H.D. presents the lips as the source of both desire
and language. Kissing, of course, would

<B></B>

"slake / the rage that burns." With this act, all tension would
subside as subject and object dissolve into one. The speaker, however,
wonders whether she should turn away and "press lips to lips / that
answer not. . . ?" The verse aptly conveys the nervous transmutation
of passion into speech. In the absence of fulfillment or response, in
its willed deferral, kissing becomes song. Moreover, the lips offer a
precise image of that creative doubling or enfolding that defines all
experience. Difference and unity, engagement and detachment--it is this
"brokenness" that produces song:

With this verse, it becomes apparent that the song is already being
sung. The poem itself is an expression not of a decision made, but of
an attenuated state. Both sensual and sentient, aroused and detached,
the speaker writes herself within the dynamics of desire. Restraint
produces language, as language heightens and prolongs passion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, a similar dynamic informs the social potential of
classical art. Put bluntly, modernists understood the power of classicism
as its ability to occasion pain. The classical work of art both offers
and denies its beauty and thus arouses passions that remain torturously
unfulfilled. In other words, aesthetic distance prohibits the potential
sublimation of kinetic desire. Consequently, the energy that would be
lost in the work is diverted back toward the world at large. Harrison,
for example, argues that while the beautiful image can "discredit
the actual practical world," it never insists on its own "actuality
and objectivity" (<I>AAR,</I> 227). For her, art "invigorates life,
but only does it by withdrawal from these very same elementary forms of
life, by inhibiting certain sensuous reactions" (<I>AAR,</I> 236). Thus,
"imagination, cut off from practical reaction as it is, becomes in turn
a motor-force causing new emotions, and so pervading general life, and
thus ultimately becoming 'practical'" (<I>AAR,</I> 210). For H.D., also,
the sterile, ascetic aspects of the work refuse immersion and enforce
a return to worldly praxis. In "Notes on Thought and Vision," the poet
argues that aesthetic beauty is similar to that of the "loved one,"
but its inaccessibility leaves the mind "enflamed and excited." While
the work of art may excite the "love-region," energy is not "dissipated
in physical relation" and thus "takes on its character of mind. . . "
(<I>NTV,</I> 22). More aggressively, in a 1916 review, H.D. praises poetry
that "holds, fascinates and half-paralyses us, as light flashed from a
very fine steel blade, wielded playfully, ironically . . . with absolute
surety and with absolute disdain." As the poet explains, this hostile
beauty does not simply negate, but actively confronts a "world of shrapnel
and machine-guns," wages "battle against squalor and commercialism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  Ultimately, like other forms of protest, her poetry halts, foregrounds,
  and suggests alternatives to the everyday. It both arouses and impedes
  desire, and thereby permits consciousness, various models

<B></B>

of behavior, and the possibility of choice. Adalaide Morris, in a
stunning article on H.D.'s <I>Trilogy,</I> explicitly aligns this aspect
of H.D.'s work with ritual practice. She argues that H.D.'s poetry "not
only <I>means</I> but <I>does</I>"; "it labors to create a formal break
with everyday life, a ritual space that invites the reader to return to,
reexamine, and rearrange the <I>ethos</I> of a community in crisis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  Similarly, Gregory contends that H.D.'s lyrics "demand from the
  reader a distinct dramatic form of attention and participation." By
  short-circuiting fulfillment, by refusing to dissolve into abstraction,
  they turn the poetic experience "inward, so that the reader is forced
  <I>through</I> the singular experience of the poem." Ultimately, the
  mediated space of the poem becomes a space of collective mediation. It
  signifies as it inspires "threshold states" in which "the tribe as a
  whole renews itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
H.D.'s various statements on the Eleusinian rites offer the most striking
account of this painful beauty and its effective power. In "Notes on
Thought and Vision," the poet argues that while the "Eleusinian mysteries
had to do with sex," sensuality was countered by "a certain amount of
detachment . . . a certain amount of artistic appreciation"(<I>NTV,</I>
29-31). Similarly, in "Helios and Athene," she claims that the
participant neither surrendered to desire nor achieved detachment,
but experienced a love that is "the merging and welding of both,
the conquering in herself of each element, so that the two merge in
the softness and tenderness of the mother and the creative power and
passion of the male" (<I>CP,</I> 330). In the poem "At Eleusis," however,
H.D. does not simply describe, but enacts this rite and its divine pain:

The italicized refrain clearly suggests a worldly enactment of
the divine. An anonymous, ecstatic "they" perform the power of the
god. Through their activity, they do not merely conjure, but become
that which they desire. Thus, with the poem's contrasting registers,
H.D. presents a rich doubling of deed and word, power and thought. Her
verses alternate between the abject and the divine, between passionate
engagement and formal gesture. The poet, however, is not content
with description or even suggestion, for she demands the reader's
complicity and thereby enacts the intersubjective nature of this
rite. The speaker engages us directly, calls forth an erotic potential
thus far obscured. However, the speaker demands our understanding as
well. Thus, the differing registers inspire and impede our desire,
encourage and deny the possibility of fulfillment. This call for
restraint is most dramatically seen in the transition between the second
and third verse, when the speaker shouts "Stop." With this "sudden
halt," the moment of unity is forestalled, and thus power and power
relations are made conscious. The priestess bars entry, and commands
us to "wait," presumably in order to achieve understanding, for "mind's
sake." Ultimately, we turn away, but now enflamed by a conscious desire,
by a renewed potential that still seeks outlet. Passion is heightened,
but now mediated and made thoughtful. Consummation is yet possible, but
informed by consciousness. The painful feeling of restriction transforms
dream into knowledge. As mortals, we wield the power of the divine.

Classical modernism, particularly as it finds expression in ritual
practice, complicates those categories with which we tend to organize
modernist literature: commitment and reaction, abstraction and
objectivity, masculine and feminine style. Not surprisingly, classical
modernism also complicates the distinctions that inform the logic of
modernity at large. First and foremost, it defines the individual
as inseparable from the material and discursive forces that shape
experience. Ritual performance consistently foregrounds the tensions that
exist between the desiring subject and its objective surroundings. Related
to this, classical modernism blurs the boundary between expressiveness
and the physical body, between the symbolic and the kinetic. In protest
as in poetry, image and desire are eternally yoked, together urging the
forces of history.
Finally, 

<B></B>

and perhaps most importantly, classical modernism confounds the
relationship between modernism and its legacy, namely, the politics of
postmodernity. Oddly, while classicism, particularly in its approach
to gender, anticipates postmodern strategies and attitudes, its most
vocal advocates--Lewis, Hulme, and H.D.--have either been dismissed as
reactionaries or dropped out of discussion altogether. Conversely, those
modernists who were most often criticized as romantic--Woolf, Stein,
and Joyce--meet today with almost universal approval. This complex
genealogy raises valuable questions not only about literary history,
but about political and economic history as well. The debate between
classicism and romanticism masked a much larger battle over the terms of
postwar society. It is time to revisit that debate and its consequences.

As Lyon explains, hunger striking served to challenge the "'natural
market' ideology of free trade economics" and to expose "the joints
between economic coercion and sexual subjection" (<I>M,</I> 116). It
should also be noted that the Liberal government responded in every
possible way to restrict women to their former activity. The most violent
of these efforts, force-feeding, expresses clearly the extent to which
this patriarchal order was dependent upon the constant activity of
production and consumption.

Victorian Modernism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Artists and critics alike view high modernism within scenes of rupture
and yearning. Even when artists vigorously stage "the new," anxiety and
nostalgia shade desire. Wallace Stevens's "poem of the mind in the act
of finding / What will suffice" once the past becomes "souvenir" conveys
this need for a modernist rescue operation in a present defined by loss.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Modernist writers, as we often acknowledge in one way or another,
  want to separate themselves and their work from the recent past as
  well as from other modernist writers and to preclude the possibility
  of rescue from their thrilling and despairing isolation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To this understanding of literary modernism, we must add the idea
that modernists were interested not just in rupture, but also in
continuity, and specifically in continuities with the Victorian period,
1837-1901. We must try to hear, within the rallying cry of "make
it new," the harmonic of "preserve it through change." It is important
to tell critical stories of both destruction <I>and</I> preservation,
and one way to do so is to bring the mid-century, high Victorian into
relation with high modernism. As we do, a Victorian modernist aesthetic
of both rupture and continuity, of stark differences and relations across
gaps, develops.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Studying Victorian modernism, we learn to consider works of art
as webs of relations and ideas with multiple centers and gaps,
a filigree-in-progress. Or, in weightier terms, we should learn
to pay attention to collections of things, arranged but subject to
rearrangement. In parallel, our critical goal must be to chart coherences
that begin and end with critical venturings from divers centers. As we
shall see, George Eliot writes of "multiplex"

<B></B>

structures, and William James of "concatenated unions." Both urge us to
consider delicate and complicated structures, not solid blocks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Victorian modernist criticism might speak of seeming solidities,
for example, "the modern epic" or "the New Woman novel." But like
the structural designs of buildings that John Ruskin often found less
interesting than their surface ornamentations, the solidities such studies
describe exist for the intermingling patterns they make possible, not
the patterns for the solidities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  The house of modernism may be aggressively streamlined or built anew;
  but it also embraces yesterday's house, absorbing the patterned
  bric-&agrave;-brac of the Victorian parlor and carefully rearranging
  it. It is no accident that, in examining the cozy and ornamented
  characteristics of Victorian art and literature, we will see that
  nineteenth-century domestic and sentimental novelists in both Great
  Britain and the United States were engaged in creating works taken up by
  twentieth-century modernist writers, high and low. Indeed, distinctions
  between high and low or serious novels and domestic novels no longer
  serve us well. Henry James was a domestic novelist just as surely
  as Elizabeth Stoddard wrote difficult, impressionist, experimental
  prose. This connection is not meant simply to redraw the lines of
  recent literary history, but rather to challenge a central truism
  of literary study: that modernist writers, beginning in the 1890s,
  made an art that clearly departed from what had come immediately before.

But why posit Victorian modernism in the first place? One answer--that
some modernist artists themselves did so--may be exemplified by
William Butler Yeats's "Introduction" to his anthology, <I>The Oxford
Book of Modern Verse, 1892-1935.</I> In their darker tableaux,
modernist artists--and Yeats is no exception--often choose rupture as
an alternative to repeating now emptied forms of the recent past. Yet
when modernist writers insist upon radical discontinuity, we should not
take them at their word. We should examine those words and the resulting
works of art carefully, because Victorian practices often vitally inform
modernist works. What is dismissed is also summoned. Yeats, for example,
in writing the introduction to his anthology, describes the advent of the
"modern" as the "wringing [of] the neck of rhetoric." It appears that
Victorian poetic practices had to die in order that modernism could be
born. Nothing less than revolution would do:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The revolt against Victorianism meant to the young poet a revolt against
irrelevant descriptions of nature, the scientific and moral discursiveness
of <I>In Memoriam</I>--"When he should have been broken-hearted",
said Verlaine, "he had many reminiscences"--the political eloquence of
Swinburne, the psychological curiosity of Browning, and the poetical
diction of everybody.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We should not blind ourselves, however, to the fact that such revolt
is only part of Yeats's programme for modernist poetry. Yeats weaves a
contrasting tale throughout this very introduction that has gone largely
unnoticed by scholars of modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yeats's poetic manifestoqua introduction not only announces a break with
Victorianisms but also embraces them. In the very sentence in which
Yeats states that young poets believe that discursiveness must go,
he discursively interrupts the rhythm

<B></B>

of his sentence to quote Verlaine--as if to challenge in expansive
prose the chiseled reticencies of modern poetry. He tells us that
modern poets dismiss rhetoric, yet the force of this statement depends
on the ornate parallelisms of its lists and the satisfactions of its
rhythms. In substance, too, Yeats argues with himself. Although the
passage describes rupture from Tennyson, Swinburne, and Browning, Yeats
continues to reject <I>and embrace</I> so-called Victorian discursiveness,
eloquence, curiosity, and poetical diction as he describes modern poets
and poetry worthy of our admiration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He tells us that Walter Pater's "pure gem-like flame" [<I>sic</I>] gave
modern poets an alternative to moral earnestness and a desire to "purify
poetry of all that is not poetry" but--and here it's important to keep
reading--that these poets found the flame "was an insufficient motive." As
the essay proceeds, Yeats establishes a shimmering ironic stance conveying
dual desires: simplification and complication, concentered gem-like flames
and unruly flights and divergences. Increasingly calling into question
the efficacy of attacking things Victorian as a way of setting modernist
poetry apart, Yeats insists, "When my generation denounced scientific
humanitarian pre-occupation, psychological curiosity, rhetoric, we had
not found what ailed Victorian literature. The Elizabethans had all
these things, especially rhetoric" (<I>OMV,</I> xvii).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So what did call for amendment in poetry, if it wasn't Victorianisms
per se? For Yeats the answer seems to lie in the need for passion--and
he proceeds, in this argument with himself, to find such passion
<I>precisely in Victorian poets and poems.</I> Modern poets, he argues,
must revivify people and poetry that have become too passive, wrest
control of events and speak for the mind's "responsibility." Intellectual
passion and engagement must have their day as "man's naked mind" claims
its place (<I>OMV,</I> xxviii, xxix). Along with the Victorian virtue
of responsibility, other aspects of Victorian poetic culture appeal
to Yeats--his own taste (which he attributes to his Irish nationality)
tends not to man's naked mind but to "a man so many years old, fixed to
some one place, known to friends and enemies, full of mortal frailty,
expressing all things not made mysterious by nature with impatient
clarity" (<I>OMV,</I> xxxvii). The modernist sage of 1935 might have
been describing a Victorian triple-decker novel, with its social world
represented in painstaking detail.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The differences between "them," the modern poets, and himself, the always
respectful Victorian modernist (Irish) outsider to modernism, accumulate
throughout the essay. The modernists, Yeats tells us, may look for hard,
positive subject matter and an avoidance of political ranting in poetry
or in Trafalgar Square, but he prefers a poetry of passionate politics,
a poetics of the heart. When in 1900, "everybody got down off his stilts
and Victorianism had been defeated," the modern movement, in Yeats's
view, was fruitfully dominated by two late Victorian writers, Rudyard
Kipling and William Watson, "who had never heard of that defeat or did
not believe in it"(<I>OMV,</I> xi-xii).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why have Yeats's own Victorian passions been all but invisible to the
central narrative of modernist literary study? And what will we begin
to see once we seek the Victorian in the modern? The answers to those
questions will, of course, depend on one's own modernism, since there
is so little agreement about modern literature's formal qualities, its
decade of origin, its longevity, and its groupings of artists and texts--

<B></B>

whether generic, national, philosophical, or historical. Yet as Stevens
says, "It is time to choose," and so we shall. One conception of modernism
calling for revision often goes by the name "high modernism," and its
dates are roughly 1880-1945. It features a literary work whose
mask of darkness and suffering may be flipped to reveal the mask of a
retrieved Romantic, visionary illumination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conceived in a time of spiritual crisis, such "anti-Victorian" modernist
art communicates an exile from the homeland of certainty as it sits high
on the shelf of autonomous art. An object to be admired, or in some cases
excoriated, for its self-sufficiency and self-involvement, the modern
work is purely sculpted, durably masculine, paradoxically spiritual
or cerebral for all its hardness, and preferably not for sale. Its
internal incoherencies are bounded by its autonomy, made whole by its
separation from the familiar. It takes the long and impersonal view,
turning away from the ordinary and the fleshly, the vulgarly emotional
and the preachy. One must work hard to understand and appreciate such
a modernist work of art, and most people will fail to do so.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What happened between Romanticism and modernism--namely, the mid-century
Victorian--has been largely left out of the story. This is not to claim
that there are no studies of mid-nineteenth-century writers with modernist
desires, or of modernist writers with ties to that portion of the literary
past lying between the Romantics and the turn of the century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Rather, it is to say that the task of integrating the two is far from
  complete, and that we as modernists should become self-consciously
  intradisciplinary<I>.</I> Over specialization, in particular the
  periodization of literary study, has narrowed our view for better
  and worse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This modernist portrait, like all composites, presents a being that
never existed. It is nonetheless one that we shall choose to take
down and handle in order to move toward a conception of Victorian
modernism. Chronologies of modernism often begin at the turn of the
century, as the airless Victorian parlor, filled with bric-&agrave;-brac,
is replaced by the "Aesthetic suite" of decadence, mysteriously layered
with exotic objects and moody atmospheres. This is replaced in turn by
the modernist "living space," cleared of conflicting patterns and sleek
in its functional elegance. The chronology of Victorian modernism, in
contrast, imagines these three periods as gathered into an incomplete
unity because they share important ideas about artists, works of art,
and audiences. Aesthetic notions and artistic practices intermingle,
entwine; or they flow and pool, even metamorphose, one into the
other. Juxtapositions become intimate relations. Phenomena of rupture
and loss give way to relation and addition, and the patterns thereby
formed link to other patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Victorians themselves had been pattern-makers, reimagining a Romantic
organic unity as a process of bringing internally linked complexities into
expanding sets of relations with external complexities. George Eliot,
for example, describes artistic form as a process of knowledge that
grows "by its alternating processes of distinction and combination,"
arriving at the "conception of wholes composed of parts more and more
multiplied and highly differenced." Multiple wholes are themselves
internally multiple, and the highest form in art involves "the relation
of multiplex interdependent parts to a whole which is itself in the most
varied and therefore the fullest relation to

<B></B>

other wholes." The best artistic form creates not a monistic unity of
through-and-through synthesis, but something more complicated: "The most
varied group of relations bound together in a wholeness which again has
the most varied relations with all other phenomena."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Eliot imagines is echoed by the modernist William James, in part
because he came of age in a Victorian household. Eliot's multiplex
interdependencies become James's "concatenated union" as he describes

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

the world . . . as a collection, some parts of which are conjunctively
and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves disjoined,
may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which they are
severally connected, and the whole world eventually may hang together
similarly, inasmuch as <I>some</I> path of conjunctive transition by which
to pass from one of its parts to another may always be discernible. Such
determinately various hanging-together may be called <I>concatenated</I>
union, to distinguish it from the "through-and-through" type of union,
"each in all and all in each". . . which monistic systems hold to obtain
when things are taken in their absolute reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
George Eliot emphasizes the wholes, James the transitions between and
within them, but they share a notion of incomplete completions, multiple
and multiply connected centers, and discontinuous continuities. Yeats,
too, describes "the ultimate reality" as "neither one nor many, concord
nor discord," the tertium quid, as it were, of all antinomies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, this essay's exemplary re of Victorian
modernism, embodies these notions in the patterns of his daily life
which are complexly linked to the patterns and arrangements of his
artistic creation. The "multiplied and highly differenced" arrangements
and rearrangements within his painting and poetry are akin--in the full
sense of the word "kin"--to the interior decoration of his London house at
16 Cheyne Walk. This is the representative story of Victorian modernism
that I will tell. But first, a brief look backward, to an <I>eclipse</I>
of Romantic Imagination that made modernism possible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Concatenated unions or multiplex relations have a Romantic pedigree of
inferiority that goes by the name of Fancy. For the Romantics, Imagination
trumps Fancy, because it allows the artist to work as a divinely creative
force. The Victorian modernists' Romantic forebear, Coleridge, describes
the supreme, God-the-Father-like powers of the Secondary Imagination. He
even coins a term, <I>esemplastic</I> (to shape into one), both to
describe such imagination and to enact it as he collapses two Greek words
into one "Angloid" word. The Secondary Imagination "dissolves, diffuses,
dissipates, in order to re-create . . . struggles to idealize and to
unify. It is essentially <I>vital,</I> even as all objects (<I>as</I>
objects) are essentially dead and fixed." In contrast to Imagination,
<I>Fancy</I> is of the kingdom of death, for it "has no other counters
to play with, but fixities and definites . . . [like ordinary memory]
the Fancy must receive all its materials ready made from the law of
association."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Fancy is, as it were, the interior decorator of the art world--it never
  creates from unformed matter paintings or poems of the first order,
  but merely rearranges existing artistic furniture. Surely, the moving
  of received,

<B></B>

dead objects about is--in comparison to the vast seminal power of the
unifying and idealizing Imagination--woman's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet through the rearranging energies of a latter-day Fancy, modernist
writers such as Marcel Proust, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, William
Butler Yeats, and James Joyce brought dead objects back to life: railroad
timetables, cracked teacups, golden bowls, heather-mixture stockings,
Connemara cloth, vaseline and orangeflowers. And they moved these fixities
about not just as objects, but as objects that require us to rethink the
nature of artistic unity as we come to grasp the Victorians' avant-garde
notions of discontinuous continuity. Gertrude Stein's patterns of words
on a page <I>as objects on a page</I> continue this tradition: "What does
literature do and how does it do it. And what does English literature do
and how does it do it. And what ways does it use to do what it does do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fancy has its own power of life in Victorian modernism, and once we
reassess its value, hitherto marginalized texts of many kinds will
suddenly appear more worthy of study. For example, mid-nineteenth-century
domestic, sentimental, or highly wrought novels by American women will
come into focus as a center, not the center, of Victorian modernism. Henry
James read widely in such popular fiction, and wrote, for example,
a review of Elizabeth Stoddard's fiction which conveys not just his
dissatisfaction, but also his fascination with the links between his
(high) art and her domestic and sensational fiction. In her children's
tale, <I>Lolly Dinks' Doings</I> , Stoddard tells of a spider fairy
named Fancie who moves in with the Dinks family and enchants them with
her miniature domestic arrangements. Fancie is kin to the "little airs"
who explore the Ramseys' abandoned house in Woolf's novel of aesthetic
domesticity, and who "all sighed together, all together gave off an
aimless gust of lamentation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Summoned home to fairyland, Fancie tells Mrs. Dinks what she will miss:

  Stoddard asks directly in <I>Lolly Dinks' Doings</I> whether fancy

  kind of earthly transcendence in the heights of lambrequins, in the

  offered to Stephen Dedalus as he tried for heaven but never arrived.

Indeed, the very notion of decorative art, ornamentation and detail
work--as opposed to one central infusion of breath that, like God creating
the world, makes a work whole--has a gendered history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  To the extent that detailed ornamentation can obscure

<B></B>

the central subject, or even take on an important life of its own,
to decorate or ornament is intrinsically to challenge the notion
of unified, mastering form. When Adolph Loos writes of the crime of
ornament and captures the spirit of high modernism by articulating a
coolly functional aesthetic of purity, he has repressed, but not erased,
Victorian plenitude.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the notions of fancy, concatenation, or multiplexity are to be useful,
they must place us on paths that lead somewhere, to borrow an image from
William James's <I>Pragmatism.</I> In one of the earliest treatises
on aesthetics that we have, Alexander Baumgarten's "<I>Reflections on
Poetry</I>" , we read that "The more that is gathered together in
a confused representation, the more extensive clarity the representation
has."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Baumgarten articulates a central finding of Victorian modernism:
  mixings, minglings, and confusions within the home as well as between
  homemaking and art-making, may yield clarity. Again, it is time to
  choose. Let us start down the path that links Dante Gabriel Rossetti's
  artistic practice with his actual domestic arrangements. Rossetti
  was a man who knew his lambrequins, and who--in poems, paintings,
  and rooms alike--assembled bric-&agrave;-brac.

Rossetti at 16 Cheyne Walk
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti moved among a confusion of categories
that nevertheless, to borrow William James's phrase, hung together. First,
he decorated the interiors of his homes, most notably that of 16 Cheyne
Walk, Chelsea. Second, he depicted, intensely and repeatedly, domestic
spaces and objects in both his poetry and his painting: bedrooms, halls,
sitting rooms; nests, bowers, cages; windows, doors, thresholds; cups,
washbasins, chairs, cabinets, screens, and mirrors. His "fine art" on
its face represents a choice of spaces and things resolutely quotidian in
nature, if frequently exoticized. Third, and in a sense encompassing these
two domestic exercises, Rossetti passionately made "arrangements" with
paint, words, and people. "Applied" art (interior decoration, crafts),
"high" art (painting, poetry) and "household" art (practical affairs
of home, hospitality)--these three arenas of aesthetic arrangement
intermingled in Rossetti's creative life, fueled by tender sentiments
as well as by pain and fear.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti lived at 16 Cheyne Walk from 1862 until his death in 1882. To
understand his house, by many accounts strangely or fascinatingly
decorated, and to appreciate its relation to his painting and poetry, we
should begin with a few facts, consider a few legends, and then examine
some of the best evidence we have of its appearance: the catalog of its
contents printed for the auction held shortly after his death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The London City Council tells us that the house, Georgian in style, was
built in 1717, that it was called Queen's House because of its association
with the flight of Queen Catherine Parr on the death of Henry VIII, and
that it has especially well-preserved and beautifully wrought ironwork.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Rossetti's studio evidently occupied the dining room on the ground
  floor; a vast drawing room on the first floor runs along the entire
  front of the house, and the second floor is primarily given over
  to bedrooms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Judging by exterior and interior Council photographs, the house is
  large and

<B></B>

elegant, a gentleman's residence. In addition to these photographs,
we have paintings by Treffry Dunn of the studio, dining room, drawing
room, and--reflected by one of Rossetti's many convex mirrors--part of
his bedroom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  Most of Rossetti's friends mention aspects of the house; but George
  Meredith, T. Hall Caine, Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton, William Michael
  Rossetti, and Dunn provide the fullest accounts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Descriptions of 16 Cheyne Walk have tended to focus on the mysterious
quality of its bedrooms, probably because the concept of the Gothic was
most available as a descriptive device for the house's hodgepodge of
strange furnishings. Watts-Dunton writes that the guest bedroom where
he frequently slept

got the reputation of being haunted; for it was hung about with sombre
hangings and antique picture panels. . . . Scattered about the room
in most admired disorder were some outlandish and unheard-of books,
and all kinds of antiquarian and Oriental oddities, which books and
oddities Rossetti had picked up at various times during his ramblings
about Chelsea and elsewhere--such as old carved heads and grinning
gargoyles, and Burmese and Chinese Buddhas in soapstone of every degree
of placid ugliness. . . . Rossetti's own bedroom was scarcely less weird
in character. There again were to be seen heavy curtains drawn closely
around an antiquated four-post bedstead. . . .

interesting and beautiful objects, which he breathlessly catalogs:

The mantelpiece was a most original compound of Chinese black-laquered
[<I>sic</I>] panels, bearing designs of birds, animals, flowers and
fruit in gold relief, which had a very good effect, and on either side of
the grate a series of old blue Dutch tiles, mostly displaying Biblical
subjects treated in the serio-comic fashion that existed at the period,
were inlaid. The fire-grate itself was a beautifully-wrought example
of eighteenth century design and workmanship in brass . . . in one
corner of the room stood an old English china cupboard, inside of which
was displayed a quantity of Spode ware. I sat down on a cosy little
sofa. . . . [<I>RDR,</I> 17-8]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Dunn as he awaits his first glimpse of the great man, others describe
coziness rather than Gothic horror. William Rossetti perhaps sums up
this position when he passes judgment on the house: "old-fashioned,
many-roomed, homelike, and comfortable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  After looking at Dunn's paintings, a comparatively recent critic, Mario
  Praz (himself a house-obsessed man), complains of the eclecticism of
  Rossetti's house: "in the end there was no style at all. Non-style
  was created from an excess of styles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  When the texture of Victorian eclecticism becomes extreme, it shades
  into modernist minimalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The common observation among these varying assessments is of the striking
number and variety of decorative things in Rossetti's house. These he
collected (in excursions ranging from the elegance of Murray Marks's
premises to the junk shops of the East End), received as gifts, ordered
to specification, and sometimes made himself. To explore this pattern,
we can consider primarily the auction catalog, with a bit of contextual

<B></B>

help from Dunn's paintings. An impressionistic perspective is helpful
here, not only because consideration of the material history of Rossetti's
belongings is beyond the scope of this study, but also because there is no
evidence to suggest that Rossetti considered himself an expert in anything
but blue and white china. He bought what he liked, and the evidence
suggests a happily roving rather than a professionally focused taste. Even
allowing for the randomness of anyone's household belongings, the list
of Rossetti's household effects indicates an aesthetic of incoherence,
repetition, and complication: all qualities that have been remarked
within autonomous modernist works--think of <I>The Waste Land</I>--even
as we have insisted that they represented a break with the Victorian past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Almost everything in the house is out of context, collected from other
places, times, and cultures. One particularly intriguing page of the
catalog lists Indian, Japanese, Albanian, Venetian, Chinese, and Irish
objects. Perhaps the candidate for the most stunning example of the
unassimilated "other" would be a foreign object that also announces
itself as freakish: "A curiously carved mahogany frame chair with cane
seat, formerly belonging to the Chinese Giant 'Chang'" (<I>VCR,</I>
no. 104). At the same time, Dunn's paintings of Rossetti's house portray a
mood of serenity and sumptuous ease. How to reconcile these two accounts?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps this sense of order issues from the very quality of confusion,
or mingling, which these objects possess, in both their internal and
external multiplexities, to borrow George Eliot's term. Rossetti's
arrangements of these objects within the rooms of his house throw the
sentimental context of "home" into high relief. We might say that feeling
provides the energy that draws them into patterns. Rossetti liked, even
adored, these things--his feelings about them provide the only aesthetic
principle informing his acts of acquisition and arrangement. Many parts
are here gathered, however loosely, into a whole. Certainly that is one
tide of energy within 16 Cheyne Walk. But complication within individual
objects can create confusing crosscurrents. The Elgin Marbles these are
not. Consider "Pair of Chinese antique girandoles [the very descriptive
terminology appears to fail], fitted with 4 shelves each, elaborately
carved and heavily gilt" (<I>VCR</I>, no. 257). Or "A very handsome
plated centre stand, inlaid with reflected glass, fitted at the ends
with 3-light candelabra with serpentine arms, the centre supporting a
cut glass flower dish" (<I>VCR,</I> no. 400). Rossetti liked this kind
of complexity: such an item sits quietly, yet scintillates with multiple
shapes and reflections.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And he liked repetition as well. Although classification can be a
problem, a conservative count of items in the catalog reveals twenty-five
cabinets, chests, and cupboards, and thirty-one glasses and mirrors. Such
repetition--think of Stein's "otherwise there is a pleasure in adding / a
doubling of their plan. / They will add adding to their tender care"--has,
like incoherence within a house, two contesting qualities (<I>W,</I>
116). Mirrors everywhere indicate either a comforting similarity or an
unnerving replication both of the mirrors themselves and the scenes they
endlessly reflect. They can make us feel at home, eerily unhoused, or even
entrapped. As for the cabinets, the issue is not just numbers--after all,
this era antedates the built-in closet. Most of these cabinets, however,
have interior shelves and drawers enclosed by highly decorated folding

<B></B>

doors in various arrangements. Within cabinets are smaller enclosures,
themselves holding discrete items, repetition within repetition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such proliferation makes of Rossetti's house a patchwork of borrowings
that announce both their common ground (they rest with a sigh in the
sentimental space of the Victorian middle-class home) and a nervous,
modern sense of contingency. Furthermore, his house is in flux as items
come and go, or are moved about: what Elizabeth Bishop, in a poem about
fishhouses at the water's edge, would call knowledge itself, "flowing
and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  Even the status of items within the house can never be clear. How
  heavily carved or exquisitely veneered must a chest be before it
  metamorphoses from storage bin to <I>objet</I>? Or perhaps at the
  very limits of artful impracticality the ordinary suddenly reappears:
  "A curious cabinet of Burmese glass workmanship, having grotesque
  res, with stand for same (suitable for a hall as a receptacle for
  carriage rugs)" (<I>VCR,</I> no. 217).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such complexities will yield clarity once we learn their syntax. To do
so, we must take seriously Rossetti's carefully arranged relations to
other people, those relations interwining with the various uses of 16
Cheyne Walk: studio, gallery, literary salon, family home, stage set,
and shelter from nature. Things, people, and works of art together form
a rich confusion, "a collection, some parts of which are conjunctively
and others disjunctively related."

the emblem of aestheticism itself.

  Our understanding of the painting might begin with a formalist
  appreciation of the pot's decorative texture in relation to res on
  the woman's robe and the background of peacock feathers and roses. We
  might then proceed to an appreciation of the pot as an incipiently
  Symbolist image of imagination and artisanry, and from there to a
  consideration of the woman herself as a beautiful, "vital object"
  and so on. But we should also attend to the aesthetic arrangements
  Rossetti made beyond the painting's frame, at the center of which
  the pot still beautifully rests. Rossetti's carefully cultivated and
  deeply affectionate relationship with the art dealer and collector
  Murray Marks, one of his principal suppliers of oriental ware; his
  own collector's obsession that led him to entertain other collectors
  at dinner and thus to people his solitude meaningfully; his feeling
  that an earlier and better culture of beauty and virtue inhabits the
  hawthorn pot, and his belief that such significant beauty can be placed
  both in his home and on his canvases (themselves to be placed in homes,
  not public galleries): all these and other arrangements must inform our
  appreciation of <I>Monna Rosa</I> precisely because Rossetti painted
  and lived them simultaneously, interchangeably.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Above all, the hawthorn pot reminds us that translation is one of
Rossetti's defining practices, as it will be for Ezra Pound. The "bringing
home" or domesticating of foreign speech is central to Rossetti's intense
practice of domestic aestheticism. He translated not only Italian poetry
into English poetry, but also real Chinese pots (already translated from
the Chinese when Rossetti named them "hawthorn") into items of English
domesticity--part of the ensemble of his sitting room--and then into
painted pots, themselves carefully placed in painted bowers and rooms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Just as a vase could be bought and sold in the marketplace, used to
develop relations with other people, treasured for its living qualities,
transformed into a painted vase, and placed, beautifully, on a real shelf
in a real house as part of ongoing domestic arrangements, so people, too,
could be patterned into art at the same time as they worked in his home,
itself an artistic studio and work of art. For Rossetti, objects were
not, as Coleridge programmatically states, dead. Rossetti understood the
"vital" as a

<B></B>

free-floating energy that can infuse (and ebb from) people, objects,
rooms, paintings, and poems alike, as he arranged them in complex
patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti conducted daily household affairs because he had to, and since
he worked at home, his domestic concerns and his artistic practice
blended. Like many a middle-class and upper-class Victorian woman,
he felt harassed by the "servant problem." But for him the issue had a
twist: he continually felt the lack of models, and sought them either on
the street (the "stunners" were both sexual and artistic prey) or among
the serving class. "What I really want," he writes to Mrs. Alexander
Gilchrist, who has been advising him on the servant issue, "is a very
handy man or youth, capable of turning his hand to odd jobs of carpentry,
etc. . . . another desirable quality would be that he should be fit for
a model" (<I>LDR,</I> 483). Just as such a handyman must be fit to enter
the studio, so the women hired as models must be fit for the workroom;
he requests, for example, that Alexa Wilding mend the fabric and then
remake the dress to be worn as she sits to him. Fanny Cornforth acts not
only as model, but also as housekeeper, for several years. At Kelmscott
Manor a local serving girl becomes the model for <I>Marigolds.</I>
A curious circularity of domestic and artistic activity develops. As
completed paintings are sold and money flows in, it must be disbursed
to cover household and studio expenses. Such expenses make it possible
for the next painting to be completed, but also bring on the next round
of bills for canvas, paint, artists' dinners, and models'/servants' wages.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the course of the years, Rossetti engaged three men to ease his dual
domestic and aesthetic burdens: W. J. Knewstub, Dunn and, toward the end,
Caine. Rossetti required Dunn, in particular, to find his way among the
complexities of a household that was part nest, part artistic factory
(with himself the principal pieceworker) and part artistic salon<I>.</I>
Dunn's memoirs indicate his initial enthusiasm for the job of artistic
factotum, because he feels at last that he is entering the world of London
art. He reminisces about a particularly vivid scene of domestic sublimity
that takes place in Rossetti's studio as a thunderstorm crescendos,
and with it, Swinburne's verse declamation:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Faint electric sparks played round the wavy masses of his luxuriant
hair. . . . I lay in the sofa in a corner of the studio and listened
in wonder . . . for it appeared to me as though the very res in the
pictures that were on the easels standing about the room were conscious
of and sympathised with the poet. . . . The 'Proserpine' gazed out more
mournfully than I had been wont to see her gaze. [<I>RDR,</I> 64]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dunn understands that the vibrations of weather (brought indoors),
fellowship (Rossetti returns soon after, and he and Swinburne sit up
until dawn together), and works of art (conscient) lead, one to the
other, at 16 Cheyne Walk. He not only fabricates frames, scale models,
and drawings to Rossetti's specifications, but also shops for artistic
props, advises Rossetti on appropriate household budgets, and searches
the house for misplaced items during his employer's absences. He absorbs
visits from angry merchants, kills rats, mails information, books, and
furniture, and even goes house-hunting for Rossetti, making sketches of
promising properties. But all of his activities require of him artistic

<B></B>

talent, aesthetic judgment, and sympathy with his artist-employer's
special needs. Spaces must be filled with appropriate light, objects
must be located or bid upon, projects must be finished so that "tin"
for Dunn's, at best, intermittent salary might be forthcoming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the term exploitation comes to mind, it is important to remember
that Rossetti himself never drew a sharp line between work on paintings
and domestic concerns. William finds in his brother's writing book the
following contiguous scraps:

The slimming man and the accomplished artist are one. Domestic upsets
easily became artistic incidents--such as Fanny's alleged breakage (or
hiding) of a blue and white jar he needs for a painting. A misplaced
medieval costume means a slowdown in work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Household matters, however, may also have unexpected value for artistic
work. When Rossetti receives a sofa ordered through Howell, he discovers
it "covered with the most lovely chintz of a Japanese pattern admirably
designed and coloured like greyish blue china" (<I>LDR,</I> 1205). To
pay for actual blue and white china--cherished as decoration for both
paintings and living quarters--he paints a picture, and makes it worth
&#163;200 "to cover a previous account" (<I>RP,</I> 62, 70). It is
perhaps only part of the story to say that Rossetti knew at heart that
he had "sold out" as an artist by engaging in the impure world of the
marketplace. If he sold out, he also, as homemaker, bought in. Pots,
paintings, sofas, pounds sterling, models, dresses, create a complicated
pattern. To keep house, however frantically, is to manage affairs in
the name of beauty--the hallmark of modernist aestheticism. And to write
poetry is to make aesthetic arrangements that include, as part of their
very composition, personal and domestic arrangements.

 "Look that it be, / Whether for lustral rite or dire portent, / Of its
 own arduous fulness reverent": Rossetti includes as the aims of poetry
 the creation of an autonomous object <I>and the care of art's readers</I>
 by purification, illumination, and warning--and all this by placing them
 in the presence of special, even magical objects. As Rossetti invited
 poets into his company, he wrote sonnets in order to bring his poetry
 into a community of readers. The view of art as "lustral rite" bespeaks a
 cyclical process (the lustrum was originally conducted every five years
 by the censors at Rome), meant to purify a people, a piece of land, or
 even the community's home, the city. A ritual cleansing, it conducts us
 to the realm of the spiritualized domestic. Sonnets themselves become the
 objects used in lustral rites or as dire portents; they must be carved,
 decorated things. In fact, the sonnet as Rossetti conceives it is another
 "medley of bric-&agrave;-brac" like that of the paintings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Sonnet" is, to summarize, arduously full, carved in ivory or ebony
with a flowered and impearled crest, and also rounded, flattish, and
engraved differently on each side. Such a medley, whether it appear in a
sonnet or a painting, might then be recognized for what it is: the modern
jumble of life sanctified, arranged by the artist-priest-householder
(or, later, by Stevens's "Man on the Dump") into an intimacy of related
aspects rather than an organically conceived unity. Details and ornaments
cannot be clearly distinguished from the things themselves (who can tell
the engraving from the coin?), and we feel ourselves moving toward an
abstraction of texture that signals the presence of the modern. As David
G. Riede acutely notes, "the paradox is that [Rossetti] consistently
saw surfaces as the most profound symbols of emotional and psychological
depths.<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, when it came to composing poetry--arranging words,
images, and sounds artfully--Rossetti retained habits he had formed
as a householder. His writing often involves the actual staging of
complex and artful arrangements of people he knows as he links his
verbal "compositions" to acts of generosity performed or received that
make it possible to paint or write. Simply stated, for Rossetti, the
personal favor becomes an element of creation that works in tandem with
inspiration--his insistence on "fundamental brainwork"--and execution. His
dealings with people can be considered as so many scripted dramas, first
acted, then captured forever in beautiful objects: poems and paintings
which themselves insist on their source in a personal, contingent,
and often sentimental milieux.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Late in life, for example, Rossetti wrote a series of sonnets entitled
"Five English Poets" (<I>CW,</I> 337-9). The sonnet on Blake
exemplifies a confused mirroring of sentimental word and tender action.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here is a confusing field of reflection. This is a poem about an artist
by an artist. It describes the domestic life of Blake--bed, nook,
cupboard, bread--as intimately linked to his "thought-wandering" and to
the speaker's vision of heaven. Artistic creation at home is artistic
creation <I>as</I> home for both Rossetti and his imagined Blake, the
sentimental home-speech that is both human and divine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Less obvious than these echoes and links, however, are the artful
arrangements of Rossetti's life that made this sonnet possible in the
first place. As one artist writing about another, Rossetti does not
address Blake's poetry or pictures directly, nor does he himself visit
Blake's house at 3 Fountain Court. Instead he turns to a "picture by
another artist of a room once inhabited by Blake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Such a choice indicates Rossetti's love of arrangements as part of
  his fascination with domestic scenes. That Frederick Shields probably
  made the sketch after Rossetti suggested he do so; that Shields sent
  him the sketch and the floor plan of the rooms; that Rossetti could
  then reciprocate with the gift of a sonnet based on Shields's gift;
  that both Shields and Rossetti, along with William Michael Rossetti,
  helped the widowed Mrs. Alexander Gilchrist complete her husband's
  <I>Life of William Blake</I>: all of these circumstances speak of
  Rossetti's continual efforts to create bonds of mutual attention
  that would literally make art out of human arrangements as well
  as words. Taking into consideration all these aspects of the poem,
  "inlaid with reflected glass" as it were, we feel the very texture
  of Victorian modernism: complexity so fine-grained that it verges on
  abstraction. And we feel it, too, within Stevens's sentimental elegy
  for George Santayana, so similar to Rossetti's elegy for Blake: "The
  bed, the books, the chair, the moving nuns / The candle as it evades
  the sight" equally acknowledge the vision of "The extreme of the known
  in the presence of the extreme / Of the unknown"(<I>CP,</I> 508).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Domestic arrangements are not the centralizing force of Victorian
modernism; they are but one of its energies. It happens that for Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, such arrangements provide a relational energy that
offers him the experience of--and the words

<B></B>

and images for--a pragmatist and empiricist building out of reality from
the flux. When William James tries to explain the finding and making of
pragmatist truth by the following out of connections, he writes, "If I
am lost in the woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path,
it is of the utmost importance that I should think of a human habitation
at the end of it, for if I do so and follow it, I save myself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  To understand that Victorian "coziness" provides both an actual
  laboratory and a philosophical metaphor for truth in the making that
  pervades art in the twentieth century is to see both "the modern"
  and "the Victorian" in a usefully mingled way. The aesthetic and
  the domestic pragmatically entwine to create an important Victorian
  modernist pattern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rossetti does not, of course, found Victorian modernism. Rather, he
provides for the moment a contingent center from which we might set
out in exploration, and he leads us to reexamine some truths which
might have slipped into truisms. We should question, for example,
the modern conception of the actual Victorian home--as opposed to its
Gothic metamorphoses--as a place of Philistine prejudices, airless
and overstuffed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  That the Victorian parlor, <I>well before the turn of the century,</I>
  might have been a testing ground for modern culture, that it might have
  provided both the space of reaction and the space of rebellion, is a
  possibility we must consider. Within this familiar context, Rossetti
  envisioned the very aesthetic values that would be taken up by decadent
  artists in England and the creators of art nouveau in France and enter
  the mainstream of what we regard as high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The highly particularized, crowded, and flattened surfaces of Rossetti's
paintings, like the abstraction-strewn, sentimental surfaces of his poetry
and the strange decorations of his drawing room, are protomodernist, or
what we should more accurately characterize as Victorian modernist. Modern
artists introduce "ornamental" patterns into paintings and literary works,
such as the decorative borders and actual textile patterns of Matisse, the
patterned furniture of Picasso's portraits, the incantatory repetitions
or iconic images of modernist verse, or the odd collection of objects
in surrealist texts. These works of art represent not a rupture from the
immediate Victorian past, but its flowering. Victorian sensibilities live
a renewed life in modernist art. Because Proust simultaneously describes
in detail the rooms his characters inhabit, depicts remembered rooms,
furnishes the rooms of his capacious sentences, and memorializes the
ornate Gothic buildings beloved of John Ruskin, he invites us to set
out in search of his Victorian modernism. As we do so, we may link
it, perhaps, to Ruskin and through him to the domestic practices of
best-selling American women writers of the nineteenth century. Harriet
Beecher Stowe, Augusta Evans, Elizabeth Stoddard, and many others,
acolytes of Ruskin all, take their place in an emerging filigree of
Victorian modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many are the directions we might take, the writers and works we might
bring into relation, as we explore a literary terrain that is richer
for its detailed, complex, and confused minglings than it ever was
for its clean breaks and firm categories. Overlooked or deliberately
ignored aspects of high modernism will catch the light--for example,
its sentimentality. Old concepts will take on new shapes: perhaps the
sublime is

<B></B>

a phenomenon of Willa Cather's communities on the plains, as much as it is
the effacement of social relations and even human identity before fearsome
mountain peaks or ocean furies. Aesthetics might even pragmatically link
hands with ethics, as we come to see that Stevens's questions of "How
to Live," the adverbial and adjectival styles we adopt, can make their
way toward questions of "What to Do," the actions that make us human
(<I>CP,</I> 125).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Imagine a young woman starting graduate school in 1965 in an American
land grant university. Remember the suburban dream of the 1950s for
middle-class (white) girls: the penny loafers and saddle shoes;
the poodle skirts and prom chiffon; the cheerleaders and Elvis
screamers; college for the MRS degree; the station wagon and four
kids. NO books. NO art. NO ideas. NO passion. Conformity was the name
of the game. Conformity and materialism. Then. The first butts of the
Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Fuck. Shit. Sex. Pot. Buttons. Pierced
ears. Long hair. Unisex style. Civil Rights. Vietnam. Pigs. Feminism. Gay
Rights. Welfare Rights. Union Rights. "What was modernism" to a graduate
student in English and American literature in the heady days of the
1960s? Modernism was rebellion. Modernism was "make it new."

Story 2: What Does a Cyberpunk Really Want?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Picture an aging scholar in 1995, past the half-century mark,
 entering into her first graduate seminar on modernism in a land grant
 university. "What was modernism?" she asks. A circle of eyes and
 silences. A couple to the side shift uncomfortably. She has cropped
 purple hair and kohled eyes. He wears fishnet stockings and thick buckled
 Pilgrim heels. A tidy tail of silky golden hair flows down his back. So
 thin in black, so pale in whiteface, they are their own shadows. They
 know "what modernism was." Modernism was elitism. Modernism was the
 Establishment. "High Culture" lifting its skirts against the taint of
 the "low," the masses, the popular. Modernism was the supreme fiction,
 the master narrative, the great white hope. To its Po-Mo descendents,
 Modernism is the enemy. Postmodernism is the antidote to the poison of
 tradition, obligation.

Listen in on an exchange between two scholars, the one graying and
the other balding in the wisdom of their seniorities--she a cultural
critic, he a social scientist. Children of the 1960s, teachers of the
1990s. It is 1995 as their manuscripts cross through snail mail. "What was
modernism?" they ask, both acknowledging it as a historical phenomenon,
but neither willing to assert that it is fully over and done with. For
both, modernism both was and is. But <I>what</I> was modernism? She
knows. It is the (illusory) break with the past, a willed forgetting
of tradition, continuity, order. It is the embrace of chaos. It is the
crisis of representation, fragmentation, alienation. It is indeterminacy,
the rupture of certainty--material and symbolic. It is the poetics of
modernity--change--and the aesthetic inscriptions thereof. (<I>Pace</I> cyberpunks, for whom modernism no longer "is" as it recedes into
the deadness of postmodernism's past.)

He knows too. Modernism is state planning. Modernism is totalization,
centralized system. Modernism is the Enlightenment's rational

thereof. (<I>Pace</I> cyborgs, modernism still lives in the danger of

critical discourse in which everyone keeps talking at the same time in
a language without common meanings. When terms mean radically different

the project of scholarship/teaching altogether.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Moral 2:</B> As contradictory terms resisting consensual definition,
<I>modern, modernism,</I> and <I>modernity</I> form a fertile terrain for
interrogation, providing ever more sites for examination with each new
meaning spawned. As parody of rational discourse, their contradictions
highlight the production of meaning possible by attention to what will
not be tamed, by what refuses consistency and homogenization. Their use
ensures the open-ended ongoingness of the scholarly/pedagogical project
whose first task is to sustain the continuation of interrogation, to
ensure, in short, its own perpetuation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Modernisms</I> is one thing, but <I>modernism</I> as absolute
contradiction is quite another. Definitions spawn plurality
in the very act of attempting to herd meaning inside consensual
boundaries. Definitions mean to fence in, to fix, and to stabilize. But
they often end up being fluid, in a destabilized state of ongoing
formation, deformation, and reformation that serves the changing needs
of the moment. They reflect the standpoint of their makers. They emerge
out of the spatio/temporal context of their production. They serve
different needs and interests. They accomplish different kinds of cultural
work. They change dramatically over time and through space. Definitions
wear the mask of synchronic abstraction, but they are always subject
to diachronic histories and spatial geographies of continuity, change,
and difference. I have no expectation, therefore, of determining or
discovering a fixed meaning for terms like <I>modern,modernity,</I>
and <I>modernism.</I> I expect differences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But opposition of meanings is something else. It goes beyond difference,
beyond resistance to totalizing metanarratives, beyond the provisional,
strategic, fluid, permeable, and situationally adaptable meanings that
characterize the most useful definitional exercises. I don't seek fixity
or plurality. I seek instead to confront directly the contradictory
status of meanings.

the meaning of the concept deny fixity but so do its grammatical and
semantic aspects. The root word <I>modern</I> is both noun and adjective,

weight. The <I>-ity</I> of <I>modernity</I> limits the word <I>modern</I>

from other things or conditions. The <I>-ism</I> of <I>modernism</I>
turns the noun <I>modern</I> into an advocacy, a promotion, a movement
presumably centered around a systematic philosophy, politics, ideology,

 yokes two of these terms, as if the slash

between signifier/signified). This is yet another contradiction that

<B>A Psychoanalytic Detour:</B> The family romance of squabbling siblings and
cousins invites a psychoanalysis of definitional debate. The dissonance of
meanings--particularly the opposition of meanings--opens the possibility
of a psychodynamic reading that looks for the irrational and covert
processes of repression, return, and transference in modernist studies
across the disciplines as these processes reflect unresolved complexes
within modernity itself.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The scene of analysis for Freud is a psychodynamic one, a stage onto which
the analysand and the analyst transfer repressed desires and complexes
long since seemingly forgotten. Transference (and countertransference)
in analysis involves the repetition of what cannot be consciously
remembered, the reenactment of repressed patterns not yet consciously
faced. Freud's clinical practice involved the deliberate incitement
of the transference so that the drama of repetition could become the
grounds for analysis itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The terminological quagmire of modernist studies may be the result of a
transferential process in which people become caught in a repetition of
the unresolved contradictions present and largely repressed in modernity
itself. The stories and parataxes of this essay deliberately stage this
dissonant drama to shift the focus from the debate about signifieds for
the disputed terms to an analysis of what produces the dissonance in
the first place. I am adapting and blending Julia Kristeva's notion of
the "textual unconscious," Fredric Jameson's concept of the "political
unconscious," and Shoshana Felman's psychoanalytic interpretations of
contentious critical literatures on Edgar Allen Poe and Henry James's
<I>The Turn of the Screw.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Particularly heated and unresolvable debates about literary meaning,
 Felman argues, can be read as transferential scenes of resistance and
 repetition. Such scenes, often confrontational and even bitter, have an
 "unconscious" that can be read psychoanalytically as a "case history"
 that brings to light hidden complexes repressed and unresolved in the
 original literary texts. Adapting Jameson's notion of the political
 unconscious for this scenario allows for a reading of how oppositional

<B>Pathways in the Wanderland of Modernist Studies:</B> How to enter into and

grammatical and philosophical; the second, political and cultural. They
engage the issue of oppositional meanings in complementary ways. Without
resolving anything, they open up different routes to the contradiction of
meaning, different ways of negotiating definitional debate, each necessary
in its own way. Without resolving or silencing it, they clarify what is
at stake in the debate and why interrogating what produces it can loosen
fixed loyalties to partial meanings.

Nominal Mode--The Noun
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In nominal terms, the words <I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I>
signify a specific content: a set of characteristics with particular
material conditions and spatio/temporal locations. This is not to say,
however, that there is always agreement about this specific content. But
for those working within or seeking a nominal framework, the definitional
project centers on fixing the categories to a set of meanings to which
others might be persuaded. Whether canonical or revisionist, such projects
assume the nominal status of modernism or modernity: it is a noun, with
a specific meaning, albeit subject to disagreement about its potential
explanatory power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nominal discussions of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> tend to be
very field specific, with definitional dissonance and even outright
contradiction developing as a result of disciplinary boundaries and
considerable isolation of disciplinary discourses from each other. The
most radical disjuncture of nominal meanings exists in the chasm
between the social sciences and the humanities. Social theorists,
political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists tend to follow
the lead of historians of Europe, who typically periodize their field
into the subfields of classical, medieval, early modern, and modern, thus
defining <I>modern</I> as the initial break with medieval institutions and
outlooks that evolved over time. Within this context, <I>modernity</I>
signifies a specific set of historical conditions developing in the
West, including the industrial revolution, conquest of and expansion
economically and politically into other continents, the transition to
urban culture, the rise of the nation state, and growing power of the
bourgeoisie. Consistent with this periodization, philosophers often regard
the theories of reason in Locke, Kant, and Hegel as the embodiment of
a distinctly modern secularism and humanism. For political scientists,
modernity often involves the development of specific kinds of political
systems, away from feudalism to limited monarchies, democracies, and
various autocracies; for economists, types of markets, capital, or
labor; for anthropologists, the eradication or (forced) assimilation of
traditional cultures through conquest or encroachment by nation states,
market systems, more "advanced" technologies, or hegemonic cultural
groups. Postcolonial theorists often link modernity with imperialism and
the national struggles for emergence within the contradictory conditions
of hybridization and continued dependence on the colonial power. And
so forth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the humanities, on the other hand, modernity and modernism are most
often associated with the radical <I>rupture</I> from rather than the
supreme embodiment of post-Renaissance 

<B></B>

Enlightenment humanism and accompanying formations in the
West. Artists and writers, within this view, constitute an avant-garde of
change, seeing sooner and more searchingly the profound significance and
future effects of epistemological, ontological, political, technological,
demographic, cultural, and aesthetic transformations. The dating,
location, and forms of rupture associated with a modernist style sometimes
overlap, sometimes vary considerably. Critics of modernist poetry often
identify a poetics of fragmentation, parataxis, image, and idiosyncratic
rhythms and sound patterns. Art historians often focus on the rupture from
realism in the heightening attention to form, especially pure geometric
shapes and planes. Architectural historians often look to the stark,
functionalist minimalism of Bauhaus design or cityscape towers as the
expression of modernity and its aesthetic in the age of the machine. For
music historians, the embrace of primitivism and atonality in a composer
like Stravinsky might constitute modernism. Media critics look to the
radical impact of the new mechanical means of reproduction--photography,
radio, cinema, television--for the sights and sounds of modernity. And
so forth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 However debated, modernism in the context of the humanities is most
 often understood as the loosely affiliated movements and individuals in
 the arts and literature that reflect and contribute to the conditions
 and consciousness of modernity in Europe, Britain, and the United States.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Periodization, however much it varies among different subfields, differs
  sharply from that proposed by social theorists and historians. Moreover,
  the epitome of modernity for those in the social sciences is precisely
  what modernity dismantles for those in the humanities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At first glance, this definitional divide seems arbitrary, produced
through the accident of disciplinary location and isolationism in
the academy and thus not particularly interesting for definitional
interrogation. However, several factors challenge such a view.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First, the opposition between the social sciences and the humanities
cannot be so easily dismissed as arbitrary or insignificant because some
fields like cultural anthropology, history, geography, political theory,
media studies, ethnic studies, women's studies, and postcolonial studies
are multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary. They exist on the liminal
threshold between the two divisions, equally engaging in questions
of representation, theory, social organization, power relations,
and empirical as well as imaginative formations. Consequently,
the oppositional meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> often
coexist within certain disciplines, fields, and institutional units in
the academy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, the borders between disciplines and divisions of knowledge
have become increasingly porous in the past thirty years with the
re-legitimation of interdisciplinarity. Such cross-disciplinary work
with modernity produces rich hybridities, but also some confusion. For
example, in his collection <I>Modernist Anthropology,</I> Marc Manganaro
(who holds an appointment in a literature department) brings together
anthropologists and literary critics to examine the interplay between
literary modernism and modernist anthropology in the first half of the
twentieth century. The result is an exciting interdisciplinary examination
of the intermingling of aesthetic and ethnographic

<B></B>

projects in the period. But the term <I>modernism</I> slips and slides
between oppositional meanings--from rational ordering sought in Boasian or
Malinowskian anthropology to anarchistic disordering found in avant-garde
art and poetics. This oscillation is never directly confronted anywhere
in the volume and is even reproduced in many individual essays. The
collection intensifies rather than illuminates the definitional problems
evident in an uninterrogated mixing of social theory and aesthetic
meanings of <I>modernism.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To take another example, the geographer David Harvey begins his
influential book, <I>The Condition of Postmodernity,</I> with an
invocation to Charles Baudelaire's notion of modern life as "the
transient, the fleeting, the contingent," cites the literary critic
Marshall Berman on modernism and modernity in <I>All That Is Solid Melts
into Air,</I> and then quotes W.B. Yeats's paradigmatic modernist lines in
"The Second Coming": "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere
anarchy is loosed upon the world" (<I>CP,</I> 10). Firmly entrenched in
the conventional literary meanings of <I>modernism</I> as disruption,
Harvey develops his discussion of postmodernism with a thoroughgoing
association of modernism, particularly what he calls High Modernism,
with the Enlightenment project of the "development of rational forms
of social organization and rational modes of thought" (<I>CP,</I>
12). Having detailed the formalist ruptures of modernist epistemology,
ontology, and representation, he then cites Ihab Hassan's famous schematic
chart asserting the absolute break between modernism and postmodernism
over modernism's supposed alignment with the Cartesian subject and
Enlightenment reason (<I>CP,</I> 42-44). In his splendid book,
influential across the disciplines in modernist studies, Harvey slides
back and forth between "anarchy" and "organization" as the defining
modes of High Modernism with only occasional allusion to the tension
between these meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Third, the insistence on arbitrary disciplinary difference obscures
what is shared across the social sciences and humanities--namely,
the emphasis on rupture from the past; debate about the politics of
modernity/modernism, and a pervasive Eurocentrism. Just what "past"
modernity abandons differs, but transformative change is a constant
component of definition. Social theorists and art critics alike argue
fiercely among themselves about the value of modernity and modernism in
debates that are more similar than different across the methodological
divides. Is modernity or modernism liberating or oppressive, progressive
or regressive, something to be reinforced or dismantled? Do its
ideas and ideals require the oppression or exclusion of some for the
benefit of others? Or do they open doors for ever-expanding, ever-more
inclusive conditions of freedom and plenty? The questions are similar,
whether addressed to issues of revolution and slavery or avant-garde
art and mass culture. Some defend modernity/modernism; others attack
it. Underlying all these nominal debates is the problematic assumption
that modernity/modernism originated in the West and is either forced
upon or imitated in diluted form by the Rest. Given these similarities,
the dissonance in the core meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
is deafening.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A nominal approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> presumes
the possibility of consensual agreement about the meanings of the terms
as nouns with a

<B></B>

specific content: a set of characteristics existing within discernable
boundaries of meaning, space, and time. However, a closer look reveals
little consensus, either across disciplines or within them. This capacity
of the nominal approach to spawn diverse and even opposite meanings
undermines the naming function of nouns. If what a noun signifies cannot
be consistently named, of what use is it as a category?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_a-head-->
Relational Mode--The Adjective
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A relational approach to the meaning of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
looks for the latent structure rather than the manifest contents of the
root term. Instead of locating modernity in the specific time of the
post-Renaissance or post-Enlightenment West, a relational definition
stresses the condition or sensibility of radical disruption and
accelerating change wherever and whenever such a phenomenon appears,
particularly if it manifests widely.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  What is modern or modernist gains its meaning through negation,
  as a rebellion against what once was or was presumed to be. Just as
  adjectives such as <I>tall</I> or <I>big</I> have meaning only in
  reference to other adjectives like <I>short</I> or <I>small,</I> the
  relational meaning for <I>modern</I> (and its siblings) exists within
  a comparative binary in which the opposite is <I>traditional.</I>
  Neither term has a fixed or universal meaning in and of itself, but
  rather acquires meaning only in relation to its implied opposite. Where
  tradition signals the unfolding of the future within the continuous
  pathways of the past, modernity calls for perpetual subversion of the
  past as the precondition of the future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Relationally speaking, modernity is the insistence upon the Now--the
present and its future as resistance to the past, especially the immediate
past. It establishes a cult of the new that constructs retrospectively a
sense of tradition from which it declares independence. Paradoxically,
such a tradition--or, the awareness of it as "tradition"--might come
into existence only at the moment of rebellion against it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Precisely because a relational definition does not seek the fixity of
nominal definitions, modernity need no longer reside solely in a specific
set of institutional, ideological, or aesthetic characteristics emergent
in the post-Renaissance West, radiating globally along the pathways
of empire and postcoloniality, and appearing as pale copies of western
genius. Instead, a particularized modernity located in space and time
could potentially emerge wherever and whenever the winds of radical
disruption blew, the conditions of rapid change flared up, or the
reflexive consciousness of newness spread--whether these were eagerly
sought or resisted; whether imposed from without or developed within.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the relational approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
raises as many questions as it appears to resolve. First, there is the
impossibility of perpetual disruption or revolution as change becomes
institutionalized. What begin as multiple acts of rebellion against
prevailing hegemonies become through their very success a newly codified,
often commodified system. Margins become centers with the proliferation
and dissemination of rupture. In intellectual and aesthetic realms,
for example, outsiders become insiders; pariahs become icons; the rebels
become the Establishment.

<B></B>

The new science of the Enlightenment that overturned the symbolic order
based on religious faith itself became the hegemonic norm based in a
faith in Reason. The avant-garde artists initially greeted with hoots
of derision--the impressionists, postimpressionists, cubists, abstract
expressionists--are now the great masters whose works are mainstays of
museums and sell for fabulous sums. Rejected, banned, ridiculed, and
often unread in the beginning, res like Freud and Joyce are for many
the supreme avatars of the age, essential reading in any history of ideas
and literature. As Raymond Williams argues, the antibourgeois origins of
modernism are lost as modernism is canonized in the post-World War II era.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  As the principle of disruption, the more widespread modernity
  becomes, the more codified and authoritative it becomes, thus
  undermining its character as the spirit of explosive rebellion and
  change. Institutionalized, the avant-garde of rupture becomes the new
  Establishment to be revoked in the making of new avant-gardes. The
  very success of modernity (and its modernist expressivities) evident
  in its institutionalization accomplishes its demise--the imperative
  of postmodernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, for all its insistence on the new, a relational modernity is
inevitably part of a generational dynamic. Modernity rebels against
its parental precursors, only to be rebelled against by its inheritors:
yet another form of the family romance. It occupies an uneasy location
between the <I>pre</I>-modern that it disrupts and the <I>post-</I>modern
that disrupts it. Never fully stable, it exists in the middle of a
prepositional chain, defined by its coming <I>after</I> the traditional
and <I>before</I> the postmodern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Third, this chain of prepositions in generational succession
challenges the relational assumption of freedom from history. The
(self)consciousness of modernity--the sense of radical rupture from
the immediate past--refuses the principle of historical continuity and
evolution in its insistence on origin, newness, and revolution. Indeed,
it denies its own production as a historical formation. History produces
change as well as continuity; the new cultural and institutional
formations of modernity are themselves the product of historical process.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, the relational notion of modernity tends to resist just the
immediate past, often leapfrogging the prior generation in a reinvocation
of a more distant past as an inspiration of rebellion. To justify this
rejection, inaccurate or heuristic readings or even demonizations of
one's recent precursors are common, much as the modernists (inaccurately)
condemned the Victorian realists to epistemological and psychological
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, much as the postmodernists (inaccurately) reduce
the modernists to mere makers of Enlightenment grand narratives. As
Paul de Man suggests in echoing Nietzsche, modernity involves a form of
"ruthless forgetting," the "<I>desire</I> to wipe out whatever came
earlier," not the actual erasure of the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  As such, the relational consciousness of modernity is based in
  historical illusionism--an insistence on "making it new" as a manifesto
  that refuses to acknowledge the presence of the past in the present
  and future. The more modernity protests its absolute newness, the more
  it suppresses its rootedness in history. And the more that history is
  repressed, the more it returns in symbolic forms to haunt and disrupt
  the illusionary and ideological mythology of the new.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A relational approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
presumes the possibility of consensual agreement about the meanings
of the terms as the structural principle of radical rupture--wherever,
whenever, and in whatever forms it might occur. Freed from the fixity
a noun suggests, the relational definition appears to garner more
agreement across and within disciplines. However, a closer look reveals
a pattern of contradiction just as the nominal approach does. Like the
noun <I>modernity,</I> the adjectival form slips and slides between
meanings rooted in the possibility and impossibility of "making
it new." If the adjectival form of <I>modernity</I> signifies both
revolution and evolution, both the break from history and its return,
of what descriptive use is it?

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
* * *

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both nominal and relational meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
end in contradiction, signaling a phenomenon that signifies both the
formation of hegemonies and their dissolution, the production of grand
narratives and their dismantling. As noun and adjective, <I>modernity</I>
is a term at war with itself, a term that unravels its own definition,
a term that codifies the principle of indeterminacy and in so doing
opposes its own commitment to perpetual change.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   In sum, the grammatical/philosophical approach to a definitional
   project confirms the partial and misleading nature of any definition
   that focuses on only the nominal or only the relational meanings of
   modernity. Modernity is not solely a fixed set of characteristics
   that might have appeared in a given space and time, such as the
   European Enlightenment or the twentieth-century avant-garde in the
   arts. Nor is modernity exclusively the principle of rupture. Modernity
   is best grasped as a set of meanings that encompasses both the
   specificities of nouns and the relational structures of comparative
   adjectives. Additionally, this combined approach suggests that meaning
   does not lie exclusively with either the formation of hegemonies or
   their dismantling. Instead, modernity encompasses both centripetal
   and centrifugal forces in contradiction and constant interplay. I
   pose this neither as a concept of historical stages nor as a utopian
   dialectic. Rather, I insist upon a meaning produced liminally in
   between, a dialogic that pits the contradictory processes of formation
   and deformation against each other, each as necessary to the other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Political/Cultural Route:</B> The grammatical/philosophical excursions lack
historical and geographical contextualization, lack reflexivity about the
production and consumption of meaning, lack attention to issues of power

itself. Definitions don't come into being or function in an abstract
cosmos of pure reason or arbitrary signification. (<I>Pace</I> linguists
and philosophers: decontextualized definitions have their place, but only
a partial one in the arena of contestation.) The textual unconscious of
definitional debate is also a political unconscious. More issues must be
posed under a broadly defined umbrella of cultural studies in historical,
global, and comparative contexts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We need to ask: Who is producing a given set of meanings for
<I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>? For what audience? From what position
or standpoint in space and time?

<B></B>

For what purpose and with what effect? What cultural work do these
meanings perform? In what way was and is modernity a set of cultural
formations with diverse parts and functions, manifesting differently in
various temporal and spatial situations, with different effects? How do
power relations condition the production, dissemination, and reception of
contested meanings? In short, how do questions of power and politics shape
both the concept of modernity and the historical phenomena to which the
term refers? These are questions upon which a cultural studies approach
to definitional power relations focuses.

The definitional act itself typically depends upon a binary of inclusion

Other phenomena do not. By definition. Definitional acts establish
territories, map terrains, determine centers, margins, and areas
"beyond the pale." Attempts to establish permeable borderlands instead
of fixed boundaries and liminal spaces of considerable intermixing
between differences diffuse to some extent the territorial imperative of
definition but cannot ultimately eliminate the function of categories to
demarcate some phenomena in opposition to others which do not belong. As
Toni Morrison writes about canon formation (a type of definitional act
in literary, art, and religious history), "Canon building is Empire

societal change brought about by a combination of new technologies,

  Defining historical periods and conditions or movements in the arts and

a politics--all the interests are vested, as Morrison says.

Take for example the literary history of modernism. Periodization,
canonization, and the naming of the defining characteristics of
modernism are all based on a pool of tenets, people, and/or events whose
selection depends upon preexisting notions of the period. Thus, Hugh
Kenner declares that expatriate internationalism is a central defining
characteristic of High Modernism and uses writers like Pound, Eliot,
and Joyce to demonstrate his assertions. On this basis, he asserts that
Williams, Faulkner, and Woolf are "provincial" or "regional" writers,
not modernists. But if he had included these writers in his pool of
modernists to begin with, his generalizations about modernism would have
been different. So might his concept of the internationalism of modernism

The case of the Harlem Renaissance in modernist studies is even more
striking. The literature, arts, and music of African Americans centered in
Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s are simply missing from conventional maps of
modernism. Not even represented with an occasional token re, as female
modernists like Woolf and Stein sometimes are. Simply not there. Picasso's
primitivism, Fitzgerald's Jazz Age, Eliot's apelike Sweeney, Sherwood
Anderson's "dark laughter," Faulkner's racially divided South--all
exist on the terrain of canonical modernist studies. But not the primary
producers of jazz, not the black artists turning to an imaginary (or real)
Africa, not the blues singers and the folk, leaving the rural South for
the urban North in the Great Migration, not the soldiers returning from
a brutal war to demand more freedoms. Their linguistic and rhythmic
experimentation, intertextual "signifyin,'" Africanist mythmaking,
parodic mimicry, revolutionary fervor, and self-identification with
the New do not seem to qualify them for literary modernism in most
histories of the movement even though these same histories frequently
list formalist experimentation, citation, mythic analogues, irony, and
self-reflexivity as definitional markers. Since the Harlem Renaissance is
largely absent from the pool of texts out of which literary historians
generate definitional characterizations of modernism, the particular
formulations of modernity produced by African Americans are also missing.

Another form the politics of definition takes is the identification
of certain res or qualities to stand for the whole. This metonymic
substitution of the part for the whole is widespread in the establishment
of the reigning characteristics of the historical condition of modernity
or the aesthetic constellation of modernism. To some, Locke or Rousseau
are supreme embodiments of Enlightenment modernity; to others, Joyce
is the defining icon of modernism. Similarly, some might characterize
western modernity in terms of the rise of the bourgeoisie, democracy,
and science; others might define modernism in terms of utopian social
planning or the poetics of disruption. Common to all such definitional
generalizations is the heuristic tendency to characterize

the whole in terms of what the historian retrospectively believes to be
its most influential or significant components. In this way, categories
like modernity and modernism govern or contain different cultural
formations, absorbing their specificities within the definitional
boundaries of the privileged metonymic part. And such categorical
discipline returns us to the locational question of who is producing
these metonymic histories. Who and what has been left out? For what
purposes? With what effects?

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tendency of binarist, circular, and metonymic definitional
acts to reproduce the play of power relations within institutions
of knowledge might lead some to affirm the need for epistemological
anarchy--the elimination of all such periodizing categories. However,
the problematic of definitional history should not, in my view, result in
its abandonment. Rather, as Jameson writes, "The problem of periodization
and its categories, which are certainly in crisis today . . . seem to
be as indispensable as they are unsatisfactory for any kind of work
in cultural study" (<I>PU,</I> 28). Without historical categories, we
would face an infinity of singularities, an approach to knowledge that
requires some form of selection that is no more politically neutral
than the heuristic construction of historical narratives. Without some
definitional categories, the politics of choice would be driven further
underground, rendered even less visible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given our need for definitional categories, however imperfect they are,
what, then, does the political/cultural route have to offer? I regard the
binarist, circular, and metonymic problems inherent in definitional acts
not as dead ends but rather as opportunities for interrogation that lead
right into the heart of the dialogic meanings of <I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernism.</I> They insist upon a recognition of how such
terms are themselves historical constructions--with their own history,
development, function, and effect, all of which invite interpretation and
critique. Different conrations of modernity reflect the different
positionalities of their producers, serve different interests, and
have different effects. It is this which returns us to the question of
politics--how power relations inform not only the cultural artifacts of
modernity but also the subsequent readings of them.

Whether the BangClash of definitional contestation produces such
transformative beauty is doubtful. But this excursion--through the byways
of story, parataxis, hypertextual detour, aphorism, and collage--has
an end point. I have been resisting the desire to come up with my own
product, yet another definition of <I>modernity</I> and

<B></B>

<I>modernism</I> for others to argue about or ignore. (Resistance is
never easy. The magnetic slide toward fixed meaning feels irresistible
at times.) Instead, I have attempted to shift attention to the processes
and patterns of definitional contestation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In these terms, there is a conclusion of sorts to be made. Definitional
dissonance matters. The fact of not only diverse but downright opposite
meanings signifies. These differences should not be ignored as accidental
or arbitrary, the ordinary product of disciplinary background or semantic
disagreement. Nor should they be tamed within the deceptive inclusiveness
of pluralism. In practice, the pluralization of <I>modernity</I> and
<I>modernism</I> runs the risk of covertly reinstating a center/periphery
pattern in which a hegemonic norm is covertly privileged over marginal
variations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Instead the BangClash should be confronted directly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The grammatical/philosophical and political/cultural
routes I explored suggest that the oppositional meanings of
<I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> point to the contradictory
dialogic running through the historical and expressive formations
of the phenomena to which the terms allude. Order and disruption are
symbiotically necessary to each other for each to have its distinctive
meaning. The center comes into being as it dissipates. Modernity's grand
narratives institute their own radical dismantling. The lifeblood of
modernity's chaos is its order. The impulse to order is the product of
chaos. Modernism requires tradition to "make it new." Tradition comes
into being only as it is rebelled against. Definitional excursions into
the meanings of <I>modern,modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I> begin and
end in reading the specificities of these contradictions.

Social and Political Thought</I> (Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame University

West (philosophical, sociological, political, and aesthetic) and argues
that for all their differences they share "an emphasis on innovation and
challenge to traditional authority" (35, 1-40); hereafter abbreviated
as <I>FM</I>; Eric Rothstein emphasizes the heterogeneous distributions
of modernity within the modern while refusing nominal, relational,
and stagist approaches in "Broaching a Cultural Login of Modernity"
in <I>Modern Language Quarterly</I> 61, no. 2 : 359-94; and

I do not examine the term <I>modernization</I> because there is more
consensus about its basic meaning as the process that brings about
<I>modernity</I> (however that may be defined); debates about the causes,
effects, and politics of modernization of course abound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT19" HREF="#REF19">19</A>.
The relation between the terms <I>modern/postmodern</I> and
<I>modernism/postmodernism</I> is as contested as the meanings of the
root words and beyond the scope of this essay. Many social theorists use
<I>postmodern</I> or <I>postmodernism</I> to refer to the rupture from
Enlightenment modernity, regarding the aesthetic dismantlings of this
modernity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as early harbingers of
the change to come later and more broadly in the twentieth century. What
many others understand to be modernity and modernism are thus folded into
postmodernism. See for example Lyotard, <I>The Postmodern Condition</I>
and Harvey, <I>The Condition of Postmodernity.</I> Because of the
inconsistency in terminology, their critiques of societal modernism
are often misunderstood to be attacks on aesthetic modernism as
well. The difficulty in determining whether postmodernism represents an
intensification of modernism or a radical rupture from it is compounded
by these differing uses of the terms <I>modernity/modernism</I> and
<I>postmodern/postmodernism.</I> Left unexplored is the possibility that
the most significant break from modernity is just now in the making,
through the knowledge revolution instituted by the computer and the
related effects of accelerating globalization.

'modernity' in a very general sense, to refer to the institutions and
modes of behavior established first of all in post-feudal Europe, but
which in the twentieth-century increasingly have become world-historical
in their impact. 'Modernity' can be understood as roughly equivalent to
'the industrialised world', so long as it is recognised that industrialism
is not its only institutional dimension." But in a relational mode,
he writes, "Inherent in the idea of modernity is a contrast with
tradition." <I>The Consequences of Modernity</I> (Stanford, Calif.:

In developing a "scalar" model of modernity in "Broaching a Cultural

describing societies as "hot," "warm," or "cold" in reference to how
intense or pervasive the phenomenon or phenomenology of rupture are in
a given time and space. His relational approach to periodization takes

Welcome to the first MSA conference issue of . The
essays appearing here and in future issues will be culled from some of
the best work presented at the annual conference of the recently founded
Modernist Studies Association. This issue will not be a proceedings
volume, but a collection of full-length journal articles by modernists
generating the most exciting work in the field at this pivotal moment
of its renewal. Now in its third year, the MSA meeting continues to
assemble a rapidly growing community of modernists seeking a forum for
vital scholarly exchange; and I hope to reproduce that enthusiasm and
intellectual energy annually. In this venture, I share the aims of the MSA
and of my co-editors to provide an international and interdisciplinary
forum for the study of the arts in their social, political, cultural,

Generally speaking, the essays in this issue present some recent
approaches to modernism and modernity. Four of its more topical articles
examine variously: the "witnessing"of war (John Whittier-Ferguson);
the interaction between poetry and avant-garde film (Susan McCabe);
gender and classical, ritual performance (Edward P. Comentale);
and the influence of the mid-century rather than the late-Victorian
period (Jessica R. Feldman). Two nontraditional, speculative essays
frame the issue, an intricate polemic on the marketing of modernism
(Jennifer Wicke), and a "definitional excursion" into the meanings
of modern/modernity/modernism across space and time (Susan Stanford
Friedman). More specifically, all six essays might be

<B></B>

organized around the theme, "mak[ing] it new," both as that
enterprise recalls the association of Pound's famous dictum with
aesthetic innovation, and in its application to the "new" modernist
studies' engagement with interdisciplinary, cultural, social, and
historical critical angles arising in the academy from the 1970s to
the present. Thus, Wicke and Friedman interrogate (among other things)
the long-term politics of the "new modernisms'" self-designation as
"new." McCabe and Whittier-Ferguson focus on aesthetic innovation, across
disciplines (poetry and film), and as mediated by history (war). And
Feldman and Comentale reject modernism's claim to spontaneous renewal
entirely, searching out its cross-fertilizations with Victorian or
classical tradition. Given their differing orientations toward the new,
the following essays often represent contradictory, even dissenting,
discourses of modernism and modernity--on the potentially transformative
or supremacist affinities of the avant-garde's preoccupation with violent
rupture, for example.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The first MSA conference issue begins appropriately with Wicke's inquiry
 into the resurgent retailing of modernism, "Appreciation, Depreciation:
 Modernism's Speculative Bubble." Using economic metaphors and provocative
 conceits, she speculates widely on what happens when modernism becomes
 (once more) a brand name. What ventures or misadventures attend its
 rebranding? Wicke advances another frame for the "new" modernist critical
 enterprise drawn from Ernst Bloch's Novum and his related conception
 of "colportage," an ever-shifting, culturally transformative, market
 version of bricolage. Wicke's illumination of the new "lying immanent
 in colportage" includes modernist artifacts ranging from Leopold
 Bloom's anomalous reading matter to the unexpected commercial success
 of insurgent Mexican cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
McCabe's timely "'Delight in Dislocation': The Cinematic Modernism
of Stein, Chaplin, and Man Ray" explores the impact of avant-garde
cinema's dislocated, automaton bodies on Gertrude Stein's disjunctive,
repetitious, "continuous present." While she devotes much needed attention
to the juxtaposition of experimental poetry and avant-garde film--here
exemplified by Man Ray's self-described "cinepoem," <I>Emak Bakia</I>, and
Stein's "Mrs. Emerson"--her essay more broadly interrogates the role of
bodily volition and processes of attention in modernity. McCabe thus
investigates the intimate relation of Stein's cinematic modernism to
comedy--iconized for Stein and the avant-garde by Charlie Chaplin's
trademark, nonpurposive "jerky gait"--and to hysteria--formalized by
Jean-Martin Charcot's Tuesday lecture/performances of hysterical bodies
suffering the "disease of attention."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Whittier-Ferguson's "The Liberation of Gertrude Stein: War and
Writing," Stein, the examplar of anti-narrative innovation (further
elucidated by McCabe's essay) competes with a more historically
accountable Stein, who is also a war writer and public re compelled
to bear witness to her experience of World War II. Defining war as a
"crucial cause of the excitements and horrors of modernity [which were]
as much aesthetic and ontological as . . . sociopolitical and military,"
Whittier-Ferguson argues that Stein's war writings display her modernity
"as fully as . . . her gnostic, avant-garde writings." Moreover, Stein's
vacillation between referential and nonreferential writing is uniquely
suited to depicting the state of war.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both Feldman and Comentale's very different essays reject the modernist
aesthetic of renewal, dislocation, and rupture from the past for,
respectively, a Victorian modernism and a ritualized classical modernism
emphasizing continuity and interrelation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Disputing the strict periodization that has defined modernism in reaction
against the mid-century Victorian era, Feldman's "Modernism's Victorian
Bric-&agrave;-brac" delineates a hybrid, interdisciplinary, Victorian
modernism which considers "works of art as webs of relations and ideas
with multiple centers and gaps, a filigree-in-progress." Accordingly,
Feldman focuses here on domestic, decorative art, using Dante Gabriel
Rossetti's home at 16 Cheyne Walk as an example of Victorian modernism's
rich arrangements of "things, people, and works of art." The example of
Rossetti's bric-&agrave;-brac affords an alternative view of modernist
literary history which includes nineteenth-century, domestic women
writers, experimental poets, and high modernists as well as avant-garde
painters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Comentale revisits the modernist debate between romanticism and classicism
in "Thesmophoria: Suffragettes, Sympathetic Magic, and H.D.'s Ritual
Poetics," asserting that both avant-garde movements--such as surrealism,
impressionism, and futurism--and bourgeois society's investment in
revolution stem from an oppressive, romantic metaphysic. Their shared
binary logic, which demands "the presence of some fallen other" and the
belief in an (artistic or divine) realm transcending the fallen world,
predisposes modern art and the common man to fascistic violence and
discourses of masculine, racial, and cultural superiority. Comentale
posits an alternative classical modernism embraced by women
protesters--from the suffragettes and classical scholar, Jane Ellen
Harrison, to classical poet, H.D.--who discovered in classical ritual a
counter praxis whereby communal, bodily, symbolic enactments of desires
rooted in the material world serve to expose, challenge, and reshape
social relations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This MSA conference issue concludes with Friedman's "Definitional
Excursions: The Meanings of <I>Modern/Modernity/Modernism</I>," a confrontation
of the glaring contradictions adhering to modernist studies, and not
incidentally, to the essays collected here. Describing her essay as an
"excursion" "through the byways of story, parataxis, hypertextual detour,
aphorism, and collage," Friedman asks, "What is <I><B>modernity</B></I>? What is or was
<I><B>modernism</B></I>?" Is it the poetics of change, the (illusory) break with the
past, the crisis of representation, fragmentation? Is it totalization,
tradition, industrialization, imperial conquest? Such contradictions
exist across generations, disciplines, and within the same fields, even
the same texts. How do we begin to unravel them? Can they be dismissed
as arbitrary, or "tamed" through pluralization, given the increasing
interdisciplinarity of modernist studies? Friedman shifts her attention
from resolution to interrogation as she charts the processes and patterns
of modernist definitional contestation using conceptual frames improvised
from philosophy and cultural studies. What is assumed? Shared? Bypassed?

By 1934 Gertrude Stein retrospectively claimed that her writing had been
"doing what the cinema was doing," and she acknowledged film as key to
her historical moment:

Kenneth Macpherson, editor of the premiere film journal <I>Close Up</I>
(1927-33), recognized the cinematic quality of Stein's writing and
widely recruited "anything [she] might send," stressing that "the kind
of thing [she] write[s] is so exactly the kind of thing that could be
translated to the screen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Stein appeared in three issues of the journal, and in 1927, published
  her portrait, "Mrs. Emerson," which was placed next to a piece by Man
  Ray about his first full-length experimental film, <I>Emak Bakia.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  That these texts appear side by side is no accident.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the importance of modern painting to the development of Stein's
art has been amply demonstrated, her specific connections to film have
been, for the most part, unexplored. I contend that avant-garde cinema
newly illuminates her strategies of representation and embodiment;
the adjacency of Man Ray's article to "Mrs. Emerson" foregrounds the
complicity of the apparently distinct aesthetic discourses of modern
poetry and cinema. Film embodies Stein's notion of "a <I>groping</I> for
a continuous present" and "an inevitable beginning of beginning

<B></B>

again and again and again,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 what she earlier designates as "all living as repeating."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Maya Deren refers to this kind of film measure as a "telescoping of
  time," "a continuous act of recognition," that becomes "like a strip
  of memory unrolling beneath the images of the film itself, to form
  the invisible underlayer of an implicit double exposure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  With the relentlessly mechanical moving picture, memory becomes a
  form of erasure, and Stein, obsessed by the processes of forgetting,
  compared her written portraits to the cinema in which "one second
  was never the same as the second before or after" ("PR," 195). Stein
  praised the cinema's ability to render the temporal displacement of
  "existing" in which "the emphasis is different [with each repeated
  moment] just as the cinema has each time a slightly different thing
  to make it all be moving. And each one of us has to do that, otherwise
  there is no existing" ("PR," 179). With its elements of succession and
  variation, amnesia and movement, film seemed to solve the apparent
  conflict between inanimate mechanical reproduction and "existing,"
  and formed Stein's prototypic medium for embodying the vital flux and
  crisis of a "continuous present."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernist crisis of representation became, for many artists, a
crisis of embodiment; and experimental film made visible a body never
visible before--one at once whole and in pieces. Like other modernists,
Stein had to negotiate the literal, posttraumatic, bodily disrements
caused by World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Further, although prevailing modernist paradigms sequestered the mind
  from the body, the corporeal became metonymic with film's materiality
  and haunted the literary works of this period. Stein's confessed
  attraction to film, however, contrasted with the more dismissive
  stance taken by other "high" modernists (among them T. S. Eliot,
  Ezra Pound, and Wallace Stevens) who associated film with the reviled,
  ephemeral body. Stein, by contrast, rejected the resources of the past,
  simultaneously insisting upon a willed forgetfulness--as if the shock
  of the present obliterates the capacity or desire to remember--and an
  expansion of bodily, sensory pleasures which Peter Nicholls has called
  the "bodily allure" of her words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Yet Stein's recuperations of viscerality did not assert bodily
  wholeness; rather, Stein's alternate modernism depended upon the
  incarnated, "existing," and, dismembered body materialized by
  avant-garde film.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here I explore specifically how the fragmented, repetitive bodies and
techniques of modernist experimental film (represented largely by Man
Ray's <I>Emak Bakia</I>) impact upon the decentered plots and bodily
disjunction of Stein's poems, and particularly of "Mrs. Emerson." Stein's
cinematic modernism relies upon the mechanical, circumambulatory bodily
depictions of both hysteria--the Freudian disease of modernity--and modern
comedy, iconicized for the avant-garde by Charlie Chaplin's trademark
gestural slapstick. I hope to show that the considerable attention
Stein devoted to the often interchangeable, cultural representations
of the hysteric and the comic originated from, respectively, her
early fascination with experimental psychology at Radcliffe in the
1890s (which culminated in a coauthored article, "Cultivated Motor
Automatism: A Study of the Character in its Relation to Attention"),
and her abiding fascination with Chaplin whose comedic semiotics of the
body she associated with the practice of her poetry. I further argue
that the modernist crisis of embodiment pervading the discourses of
psychology and the comedic connect the techniques of experimental film
with those of modern poetry.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before exploring the relationship between these diverse res (Stein,
Man Ray, and Chaplin), however, it would be useful to establish how
modern poetry converged with the aesthetics of film montage, linking the
dislocated, automaton body of modernity with the avant-garde subordination
of plot to somatic, disjunctive rhythms. Sergei Eisenstein theorized
the connection between poetry and film by drawing, as Pound had done,
upon haiku and ideographic language, invoking rhythm and the "concept
of intervals," for instance, to explain montage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  "The whole charm of poetry" emerges, his theory explicitly states,
  from the "reconstruction of the event in montage fragments" where "the
  plot is no more than a device" ("DA," 60-1). Evoking Flaubert's
  ideal of a book "about nothing," charged by the "force of its style,"
  Eisenstein emphasized that dramatic tension revolves around "the
  methodology of form--not content or plot!" ("DA," 49). These aesthetic
  criterion resonate with the antimimetic imperative in avant-garde film
  and Stein's poetic credo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The kinship between modern poetry and film that I examine in this
essay hinges upon the subordination of plot to rhythm, but also upon a
montage aesthetics that privileges the fragment and its abrasion of other
fragments. Film "pieces," as Eisenstein defines montage, orchestrate in
a "rhythm" produced through the "collision of independent shots" ("DA,"
49). He emphatically asserts that artistic dynamism emerges out of the
"<I>irregularity of the part</I> in relation to the laws of the system as
a whole" ("DA," 47; emphasis added). Similarly, the dislocated bodies of
modernity, as we will see, depend upon the part as detachable from the
whole. Like Stein and Man Ray, Eisenstein foregrounds the fragmentary
moment--"[t]he shot is a montage cell"-- while giving it corporeal,
relational consequence ("DA," 53). Film art, like poetry, insists upon the
body in flux, not as transcendental signifier; Eisenstein consistently
construes montage as embodied poesis, even as that body composes itself
through the collision of fragments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, while modern poetry and film intersected through the dislocated
body, the very somatic traumas of modernity made, as Walter Benjamin
writes in his famous essay on Baudelaire, the "possibility of lyric
poetry questionable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Film threatened to supplant poetry as a medium more suited to the
  immediacy and eviscerated attention of modernity: "There came a day
  when a new and urgent need for stimuli was met by the film. In a film,
  perception in the form of shocks was established as a formal principle"
  ("SM," 175). Baudelaire's capacity to place "shock experience at
  the very center of his artistic work," Benjamin claims, enabled his
  unique success, but raised the stakes for the body of the modern poem
  in competition with an emergent film medium ("SM," 163). Cinema more
  capably induces an automatic "reaction to shocks," Benjamin elaborates,
  since the "rhythm of production on a conveyer belt is the basis of
  the rhythm of reception in film" ("SM," 175).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  I hope to demonstrate, however, that Stein's poetry rendered this
  characteristic automatism issuing from overwhelming shock experience
  the "kinaesthetic" ground of her modernism. Like Benjamin's cinematic
  "conveyer belt," which relies on mechanical repetition, Stein's writing
  strove to reproduce dislocated experience where "one second was never
  the same as the second before or after" ("PR," 195).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, Stein embodies Benjamin's model of modernity's accelerated
shock experience as it impinges upon "remembrance"--the crystallizing
of experience through reflection. According to Benjamin, reflex takes
over as modern consciousness strives for "protection against stimuli"
("SM," 161). Modern consciousness, in this way, approximates the
fragmenting shutter mechanism in film, and attention is held at the
expense of contiguity. Visceral shock jolts the body into grasping an
experience and simultaneously threatens to blot its memory. By contrast,
Proustian memory (in Benjamin's essay) commits itself to disinterring
what is uncovered by the "m&eacute;moire involuntaire," that which has
"not been experienced explicitly and consciously, what has not happened
to the subject as an experience" ("SM," 160). If, as Benjamin claims,
it is necessary for Proust to chance upon an object that will unfold
unconscious memories, Stein makes an art out of such stumbling for its
own sake. Her writing forgets itself as it perambulates. Lacking the
high modernist desire to monumentalize the past as interior or collective
memory, Stein enacts a consciousness embodied through automatic gesture
and immersed in the porous breakdown of continuity. Her writing--a kind of
shock absorber--resists remembering: "We in this period have not lived in
remembering, we have living in moving being necessarily so intense that
existing is indeed something, is indeed that thing that we are doing"
("PR," 182).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="1" HREF="8.3mccabe_1.html">
<IMG
ALT=""#660066" 1. "
ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/8.3mccabe_1b.gif"></A>

Thus, the "series production" of Stein's modernism mechanizes and
fragments corporeality, creating a cinema of vivisection in which the
reflexive body does not quite hold together or congeal. Similarly, Man
Ray describes <I>Emak Bakia</I> in <I>Close Up</I> as adamantly serial
and partial, a "series of fragments, a cinepoem with a certain optical
sequence [that] make up a whole that still remains a fragment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  A still of repeating frames from the film accompanying
  Man Ray's article illustrates this emphasis on the part (<A
  HREF="8.3mccabe_1.html"> 1</A>). Precluding ultimate cohesion,
  Stein similarly articulates: "A whole is inside a part" in "Salad
  Dressing and an Artichoke."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The "period of the cinema" consequently became for Stein the period
  of the fragment. "[I]t is not possible," she writes of her era,
  "to choose a completed sentence a completed thing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  (Oddly, Stein responded with terror the first time she saw her "speaking
  body on screen" in a 1930s newsreel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  I propose that Stein's terror emerged from seeing herself as a whole,
  animate body in a reproduction that did not match her sense of
  dislocated corporeality.) Stein's emphasis on the fragment suggests
  Kaja Silverman's observation that "a unified bodily ego comes into
  existence only as the result of a laborious stitching together of
  disparate parts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  While film allows for a continuous motion or present, the spliced
  pieces perpetuate its seeming smoothness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first part of this essay develops the theme of Stein's (and to a
lesser extent, Man Ray's) debt to cinematic bodily representations
of plotlessness and the fragmented continuous present. It focuses
particularly on Charlie Chaplin's aimless, "jerky" gait as iconic for
the avant-garde in general and for Stein and Man Ray's art practices
in particular. The second section explores Stein's early experiments
in behavioral psychology and her understanding of the hysterical body
(or approximations of it) which culminated in her first publication
"Motor Automatism." While these experiments

<B></B>

remain largely unexamined, regarded as irrelevant to Stein's poetic
experiments, they dramatically prere her cinematic embodiment of
distracted and forgetful attention. The third portion of this essay
examines how modernist representations of the hysterical and comedic
body (already hinted at in "Motor Automatism") overlap, becoming
interchangeable through Henri Bergson's definitions of comedy and
Jean-Martin Charcot's formulations of hysteria. The essay concludes with
a detailed delineation of Stein's incorporation of these cultural tropes
of bodily dislocation in "Mrs. Emerson" through juxtaposition with Man
Ray's <I>Emak Bakia.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While many other texts might serve to demonstrate Stein's cinematic
writing (as Macpherson suggests), "Mrs. Emerson" forms an exemplary
"collection of repeated references," filmicly scored (<I>CM,</I>
25). Margaret Dickie suggests that Stein's "willingness to detach words
from referential meaning" and to arrange them in abstract designs often
overshadows her anatomizing of the body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Yet "Mrs. Emerson" is at once both abstract, and explicitly sensory
  and physical: "I do not share unless you are coming unless you are
  coming to caress country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Similarly, Man Ray's films are abstract and plotless (particularly
  <I>Emak Bakia</I>), and as Inez Hedges observes of Man Ray's <I>L'Etoile
  de Mer,</I> place the "human body on equal footing with objects."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Neither Stein nor Man Ray in their apparently "pure" antinarrativity
  forsakes embodiment, but instead focuses upon the body in segments
  and gestures. As popular icon, Charlie Chaplin haunts these texts,
  linking the gestural body, modernist comedy, and experimental

<B></B>

representation. Like Chaplin and Man Ray, Stein abandons the illusionist
ambitions of theater, and instead shows the piecemeal body engaged in
nonpurposive gestures. By triangulating these res, I hope to reveal
how Stein bridges an embodied slapstick with an abstract film aesthetic.

Stein, as I have said, devises an aesthetic indebted to film's capacity to
track and splinter the shock of a "continuous present." Man Ray's films,
in turn, pivot upon a "series of fragments" that develop in several
instances out of his contact with avant-garde poets similarly invested
in the fragmentary and serial. The surrealist, trance-inspired poet,
Robert Desnos, for example, inspires Man Ray's second full-length film,
<I>L'Etoile de Mer</I> , and Mallarm&eacute;'s "A Throw of the
Dice Can Never Do Away with Chance" ignites his <I>Myst&egrave;re du
Chateau</I> . <I>Emak Bakia</I> begins with shots of a brightly lit
revolving merry-go-round to emphasize the inscriptive capacity of film,
"its status," Inez Hedges elaborates, as "'writing motion in lights'
(<I>kinematographein</I> and <I>photo-graphein</I>)" ("CV," 99). And
just as Man Ray is "adamant that there be no script," no progress in
<I>Emak Bakia,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Stein's writing foregrounds its break from linear plot in a repeating
  and circular "communication":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If heating is beside the meal and the selection of masterpieces makes
communication, communication is ardently rechosen, communication is
suddenly respected, communication is suddenly resumed, communication is
suddenly rested, communication is suddenly respected, communication is

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage "selects" its parallel abstract strips and measured "beats,"
yet dramatizes the passive or involuntary; what "is suddenly chosen"
knits together words buried in other words by linguistic dislocation,
as with "rested" in "respected."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, neither "Mrs. Emerson" nor <I>Emak Bakia,</I> despite their
titles, follows a single character. In Stein's piece, an "I" shifts
to a "she" or "he"; pronouns are merely instrumental. Nowhere does
"Mrs. Emerson" (only a ghostly transcendental re) materialize, and
"characters" appear and quickly evaporate. "Mrs. Evangeline Henderson
came in" only to vanish immediately ("ME," 23). Like Stein's writing,
Man Ray's film denies a stable subjectivity. <I>Emak Bakia,</I> he tells
us, is the name of his patron's estate and comes from a Basque saying
that means "leave me alone." Both "Mrs. Emerson" and <I>Emak Bakia</I>
resist propriety and continuity, and yet grapple with embodiment as
self-consciously aware of its filmable, evanescent and fragmentary
character. Hedges points out in her essay on Man Ray's <I>L'Etoile de
Mer,</I> that "pellicule"--Latin for "little skin"--designates "the idea
of celluloid as skin," a fact that becomes resonant with Man Ray who
"would typically write on his film"; in this context, each shot denotes
a temporal marking and shedding of skin or bodily surface ("CV," 99).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Man Ray's actual relationship with Stein ended abruptly, but further
reveals their interart cross-hatchings. P. Adams Sitney observes that
Man Ray's photograph, used for the frontispiece of the successful <I>The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</I> featured Alice in a doorway and
eclipsed Stein "deep in shadows as she sits writing at a table."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  And Man Ray recollected in his <I>Self Portrait</I> that his "portraits
  of Gertrude Stein were the first to appear in print, to give her small
  circle of readers at the time an idea of how she looked."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  At this time he exchanged some prints for Stein's "portrait of [him]
  in prose" (<I>SP,</I> 260). With the subsequent publication of <I>The
  Autobiography,</I> she required publicity photographs, but when Man
  Ray sent a "modest bill," Stein refused payment on the grounds that
  "we were all struggling artists" (<I>SP,</I> 260). Their exchange of
  portraits led paradoxically to their estrangement from one another.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's meeting with Chaplin, by contrast, points towards an imagined
identification. She viewed her art as a necessary precursor to his, or
at least as a simultaneous mirror of it,acknowledging Chaplin's iconic
importance for the Parisian avant-garde crowd in <I>The Autobiography</I>:
"The clowns had commenced dressing up in misfit clothes instead of the
old classic costume and these clothes later so well known on Charlie
Chaplin were the delight of Picasso and all her friends."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Chaplin himself summed up Stein's admiring perception of his work as
  avant-garde plotlessness when they met in the 1930s, "She would like
  to see me in a movie just walking up the street and turning a corner,
  then another corner, and another" (<I>MM,</I> 159). And Stein extolled
  Chaplin's early gestural films during and before World War I rather
  than his later plot-driven ones. For her, the poet and the comedian vie
  for an inaugural role: "he wanted the sentiment of movement invented by
  himself and I wanted the sentiment of doing nothing invented by myself"
  (<I>MM,</I> 160); implicitly, she saw herself as initiator of both.

This small compendium of Chaplin as iconic re adumbrates a dislocative

Ray. Accordingly, Fernand L&eacute;ger memorialized the cubist
Chaplin as living machine in <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique</I> (<A
HREF="8.3mccabe_2.html"> 2</A>). One shot in <I>Emak
Bakia</I> used a diagram of a jumping man from Jules-Etienne Marey's
scientific motion studies, a borrowing that accents automatic dissolutive
locomotion. Importing his own collage-sculpture <I>Dancer/Danger</I>
made of cogs and wheels for another image, Man Ray rendered it kinetic
with a spiral of smoke, its ambivalent sign <I>Dancer/Danger</I>
perhaps suggesting L&eacute;ger's earlier mechanical and endangered
(about to fall apart) body. This mechanistic trope owed precedence to
Chaplin himself who, Benjamin observed, is "his own walking trademark"
with his spasmodic, nonpurposive gait.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  It seems that Chaplin "cannot walk. He cannot put one foot in front of
  the other. He cannot move forward," Willy Hass remarked in 1923 ("CR,"
  106). Gilles Deleuze further describes this trajectory as a function
  of time: "Charlie caught in the instant, moving from one instant to
  the next, each requiring his full powers of improvisation; finally,
  the line of the universe which he describes in this way, the broken
  stroke which makes itself felt even in the angular swerves of his walk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chaplin's gait as both a continuous present and a "broken swerve"
is symptomatic of the modernist obsession with nonteleological
movement. Pound found an early form of such kinesthetic gesture in
Noh theatre that rendered an "art of splendid posture, of dancing and
chanting and of acting that is not mimetic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Elizabeth Grosz accurately summarizes Nietzsche's notion of an embodied
  practice of knowledge: "Philosophy

<B></B>

itself was to be written walking--or, preferably, dancing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Such embodiment, she adds, roots itself in the corporeal "incapacity to
  grasp all": "There is nothing beyond the multiplicity of perspectives,
  positions, bodily forces" (<I>VB,</I> 128). Yet both Pound and
  Nietzsche's delight in dance miss the nuance introduced through
  mechanical reproduction in its ability to expose the body's loss of
  control, dislocation, and propensity to automatism. This aspect of
  modernity's nonmimetic art crystallizes in Chaplin who may assume the
  sudden ability to skate with acrobatic grace in <I>The Rink</I> ,
  but whose elastic body is never rendered entirely volitional. In the
  opening of <I>The Tramp</I> , for example, Chaplin is successively
  knocked down by a motor car; no sooner does he dust himself off than
  he is once more struck down, as if aware only of the discrete moment
  and the purely reflexive. Each repeated motion undoes itself so that
  it appears both that Chaplin will never progress across the road and
  that he must "pull himself together" with each tumble.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Significantly, Stein's circumlocutory comic mode, her "broken stroke,"
is intertwined with her cinematic impulses. As with avant-garde film,
"what matters" in silent film comedy "is that the units follow each
other uninterruptedly, not that their succession implements a plot."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  Similarly, in his book on silent comedians, Walter Kerr cites Chaplin's
  sense of existence as incessantly "unstable and malleable,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  constituting a "reflexivity" that foregrounds the comic
  "interchangeability of things" and the instability in metaphor itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Chaplin becomes paradigmatic of the successive slippages Stein performs
  in her modernist experiments. Chaplin's "awareness of instability,"
  Kerr further proposes, taught him to dance, a practice which acts like a
  "crowbar to detach him from the action" (<I>SC,</I> 92). And Benjamin's
  characterization of Baudelaire's "jerky gait," his very physical "art
  of being off center" likewise anticipates this modernist method of
  detachment from plot, and the way Stein manages to "keep centre well
  half full" ("SM," 176, "ME," 23). Indeed, locomotion, intentionally of
  a mistaken or circular kind, is a recurrent motif in Stein. These comic
  one-liners exemplify her balancing act and rejection of continuity:
  "Call me semblances. / I call you a cab, sir" (<I>LB,</I> 32). "What
  do you do to stop. / What do you do to go on. / I do the same," she
  writes in <I>Lifting Belly,</I> followed a few lines later with "what
  do you do to turn a corner" (ibid.). Such lines, indicating propulsion
  along with relapsing, reverberate with her sense of Chaplin's endless
  circumnavigation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These kinds of bodily dislocations also point towards the modern trope
of the evasive hysteric, culminating in Freud's frustrated attempt to
master Dora's body by pinning down her symptomatic acts in a coherent
narrative. Before Freud, Jean-Martin Charcot's "theater of living
pathology" at the Salpetri&egrave;re Hospital in the 1870s and 1880s
preres the cinematic reproduction of bodily movement, his photographs
of hysterical gestures here suggestive of the dislocated bodies of Stein,
Chaplin, and Man Ray.

Stein distanced herself from both psychoanalysis and surrealism, yet

  Pavlov's lesser-known version of hysteria-- pivotal in experimental

<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  The hysteric in these cultural renderings slides into the comic gestural
  body, montaged "together in pieces" (<I>LB,</I> 27). The comic/hysteric

  "Mrs. Emerson"; the "inhibitory" and absurdist ennui of refusal erupts:

Motor Automatism and Hysteria
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein studied with both William James and Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg, author of
the seminal <I>Photoplay</I> , at Radcliffe in the early 1890s and
became acutely interested in psychophysiological models of human behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  After conducting experiments in automatic writing under the
  supervision of M&uuml;nsterberg, Stein's 1896 debut in publishing,
  "Motor Automatism" (in the <I>Harvard Psychological Review</I>),
  tellingly belonged to the emergent field of experimental psychology. She
  published this piece with Leon Solomons along with an addendum,
  "Cultivated Motor Automatism: A Study of Character in its Relation to
  Attention," written solely by herself. These articles reveal Stein's
  early obsession with the relationship between bodily sensation,
  attention and memory. Ultimately, Stein's comic and filmic sensibility
  relied upon acts of willed automatism that heighten the fragmentariness
  and dislocations within reiterative gesture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to understand Stein's rendering of bodily gesture--and her link
to both Chaplin and Man Ray--I will look in some detail at these first
publications. Linda Wagner-Martin describes them as an early discounting
of "automatic writing," a point corroborated by Stein's disavowal
in <I>The Autobiography</I>: "Gertrude Stein never had subconscious
reactions, nor was she a successful subject for automatic writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  However, while "Motor Automatism" examines the "limits of normal
  automatism" and the acts of so-called normal people as opposed to
  those of hysterical subjects, the article determines that automatism
  permeates the everyday activities of the nonhysterical subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  (Stein and Solomons, I should note, are the only "normal" subjects of
  the experiment in the first article.) At the same time, they consider
  hysteria as linked to automatism especially in terms of the phenomenon
  of "double personality," the experience of dissociation often red by
  the detachment of a bodily organ from consciousness, or rather as the
  detachment of motor impulse from consciousness of it as proprioceptive
  ("MA," 9).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The enmeshment of the psychical with the kinesthetic as well as the
dislocation between these domains constitute the basis for Stein's comedy
and her cinematic modernism. Significantly, Stein and Solomons anchor
"the feeling of personality" in an "expectation represented by the group
of feelings we have called, for convenience, the motor impulse" ("MA,"
26). They assert that the "writing of a word at dictation" involves
"the formation of a motor impulse" that "consists of a melange of visual
and kinesthetic material--whatever ordinarily innervates our writing--as
well as other elements not easily described" ("MA," 14). The absenting
of consciousness from motor impulses leads then, as they formulate it,
to automatism, or in more severe cases, to hysteria.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In their first experiment, they instructed their subject to "get himself
as deeply interested in a novel as possible" and at the same time to ready
himself to take dictation ("MA," 10). They conclude that "although the
arm does not really move spontaneously, yet any movement once started
up tends to continue of itself" unless "deliberately checked by the
will of the subject" ("MA," 11). Induced automatic writing leads to an
experience of the "extra personal" or put more bluntly: "It is not he
but his arm that is doing it" (ibid.). The subject, when sufficiently
distracted, loses a sense "of intention or desire," producing the
"tendency to <I>movement from purely sensory stimuli,</I> independent of
any conscious motor impulse or volition" ("MA," 12; emphasis added). This
dissociation between "personality" and attention forms an early example of
the automatism issuing from the sensory bombardment of modernity Benjamin
will describe, and preres Chaplin's comedic body, his automaton,
jerky reception of shocks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, the experiment implies not only that bodily movement
or reflexive sensation can become dislocated from consciousness, but
also questions the efficacy of memory or its coincidence with motor
impulses in the act of writing. Knowledge emerges "by sensations from
the arm." The subject

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
was conscious that he just had written a word, not that he was about
to do so. While mere scribbling went on the subject would scarcely be
conscious that he was doing anything. . . . Small words would usually
be completely written before the subject knew about it. ["MA," 12-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These observations denote ruptures or "lapses in consciousness"; only
belatedly does the subject remember the activity of his arm. Thus memory
does not function to bolster identity, but contributes to a feeling of
dislocation. Knowledge comes late, after the fact, in the "memory after
image" ("MA," 15). Similarly, simultaneous action--reading and taking
dictation at once as in Stein's experimental study--further fractures
the experience of the body which is paradoxically both attentive and
distracted in its dispersal among activities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  Chaplin in <I>Sunnyside</I> , for example, embodies this kind

While the article is written collaboratively, "Motor Automatism" is
prescient of Stein's writing processes, particularly her penchant for

For instance, one paragraph of the essay delineating the characteristics

<I>A marked tendency to repetition.</I>--A phrase would seem to get into
the head and keep repeating itself at every opportunity, and hang over
from day to day even. The stuff written was grammatical, and the words
and phrases fitted together all right, but there was not much connected
thought. The unconsciousness was broken into every six or seven words
by flashes of consciousness, so that one cannot be sure but what the
slight element of connected thought which occasionally appeared was due
to these flashes of consciousness. But the ability to write stuff that
sounds all right, without consciousness, was fairly well demonstrated
by the experiments. ["MA," 21]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this passage, repetition is not connective, but rather functions much
like a reflexive motor impulse. Anticipating Eisenstein's delineation of a
montage style that exceeds plot and the dislocated body accompanying it,
the passage also suggests that grammatical writing which "fits together"
is not necessarily "connected thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  The interruptive "flashes of consciousness" produce only dilatory
  coherence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The language of "Motor Automatism" uncannily both resembles Man
Ray's <I>kinematographein</I> and echoes William James's "Stream of
Consciousness"  where he describes consciousness as "a kaleidoscope
revolving," with the flight between repeating images taking precedence
over the resting upon a final or static assemblage of images.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  As if referring to Man Ray's experimental film and the avant-gardist's
  use of the camera, James depicts a mobile consciousness engaged in
  continual rearrangement, governed by shifts between "magical rapidity"
  and "relatively stable forms" ("SC," 180-1). Stein and Solomons
  import this sense of fractured and contingent subjectivity and link
  it more fully than James to kinesthetic experience. A shifting in
  tempo and rhythm become a visceral fluctuation between distraction and
  belated attention, demonstrated by this semi-confessional observation:
  "Miss Stein found it sufficient distraction often to simply read what
  her arm wrote, but following three or four words behind her pencil"
  ("MA," 21).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Stein's follow-up article, "Cultivated Motor Automatism," she included
more subjects. This investigation of automatic writing delineates two
personality types (foreshadowing her classification of human character in
<I>The Making of Americans</I>): Type II, as she calls this personality,
is more prone to automatism and "is much nearer the common one described
in books on hysteria" than Type I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Assuming a kind of Charcotian role, Stein oscillates between guiding
  the hands of her Type II subjects and releasing them to their own
  impulses. She choreographs or "cultivates" the "decidedly rhythmic
  character" of motility:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

At first there was a continued return to the old movement or to no
movement, but gradually came an <I>aimless indefinite movement,</I>
then again the old, then the new, and then again an uncertain movement,

like the struggle between two themes in a musical composition until at

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another of her Type II, protohysteric subjects verges on slapstick,
dynamized by mechanical automatism: "He had a spontaneous movement of
a circle made with the swing of the whole arm. He began these circles,
gradually increasing in speed, not breaking into any other movement,
just a continued rush of circles" ("CMA," 32).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Real automatism," Stein and Solomons assert, occurs "<I>whenever
the attention is sufficientlydistracted</I>" ("CMA," 14). Hysteria
becomes thereby truly the disease of a modernity characterized by the
onslaught of shock experience. Furthermore, if hysteria, as Stein and
Solomons reiterate, is a "<I>disease of attention</I>" ("MA," 26),
then film becomes an aesthetic equivalent by its paradoxical capacity
to hypnotize and to diffuse sensory experience, to hold and to divert
attention. Accordingly, Stein and Solomons summarize their findings:
"Our problem was to get sufficient control of the attention to effect this
removal of attention. In hysteria this removal of attention is effected
by the anesthesia of the subject. We <I>would</I> not, the histerique
<I>can</I> not, attend to these sensations" ("MA," 25). In its distinction
between willed and involuntary loss of attention or anesthesia, the
article points towards the avant-garde's purposeful oscillation between
"derangement of the senses" (to invoke Rimbaud's influential aesthetic)
and control. As "operator," Stein and Solomons will their own distraction,
yet suggest that "habits of attention" often partake of the unconscious
or appear involuntary, a dialectic that will underpin <I>Emak Bakia</I>
and "Mrs. Emerson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  These experiments afforded Stein an early opportunity to visualize
  and construct the dislocated body that will animate her poetics.

Comic/Hysteric Bodies: Charlot/Charcot
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jean-Martin Charcot's Tuesday lecture/performances of hysterical
bodies suffering the "disease of attention" at the Salpetri&egrave;re
Hospital deflect narrative, and revolve around the nonpurposive gesture
characteristic of what I am calling modernist comedy. Elisabeth Bronfen
summarizes Charcot's reading of hysteria as "somatic performance of traces
of a psychically traumatic shock" that reveal the "hysterical" body as
disruptive of coherent plot: "It articulates through an unjust image,
speaking deceptively, obliquely" (<I>KS,</I> 175). The body abstracts
itself as it articulates "the radical nothing that experiences of loss
entail" (<I>KS,</I> 188). It is this "radical nothing" that converges
with the comic mode typified for avant-gardists by Chaplin in his
"resistance to meaning." Suggestively, the second phase of the hysterical
attack, as mapped by Charcot, is the "period of grands movements, of
contortions and body dislocations," what he "came to call the clown
phase [<I>p&eacute;riode clonique</I>]" (<I>KS,</I> 180). (Stein's
experimental subject, detached from purpose, rapidly swinging his arms,
comes to mind.) The hysteric body, formalized and framed by Charcot and
his followers, becomes interchangeable with the comic body in modernist
cultural discourse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Henri Bergson's extended essay, "Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of
the Comic" , confines itself to the theater for its exempla, but
nevertheless reveals how these two bodies, the comic and the hysteric,
overlap in the cinematic aesthetic of

<B></B>

Stein, Chaplin, and Man Ray.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  (Bergson, incidentally, had been among the attendees at a Charcot
  performance.) As if echoing Stein's essay with Solomons, he considers
  the comedic body's capacity for repetition and automatism as signifying
  the loss of an otherwise necessarily "constant alert attention" to
  the needs of the moment, as a slip into absentmindedness (<I>L,</I>
  22). In such a state, the body abjures its "tension and elasticity"
  and so partakes of the unwilled mechanical. Bergson elaborates, "The
  attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are laughable in
  exact proportion as that body reminds us of a mere machine" (<I>L,</I>
  32). (Chaplin in <I>The Rink</I> turns his cane into a crank,
  a prosthetic extension of his body, using it to wind up his rival
  as if both bodies are mechanical.) Comedy, he contends, "consist[s]
  in looking upon life as a repeating mechanism, with reversible action
  and interchangeable parts" and persists only as life "forgets itself"
  (<I>L,</I> 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I have already noted, Stein often poses as an amnesiac, using
repetition to foreground dissociation: "Let me recite what history
teaches. History teaches," she writes in "If I Told Him: A Completed
Portrait of Picasso."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  The joke here relies on the way her repetition undermines itself as
  the sentence jerkily springs back to its initial iteration. In the
  same piece, she refers to a camera's attentive "selection" of images:
  "Shutters shut and open so do queens. Shutters shut and shutters and so
  shutters shut and shutters and so and so shutters and so shutters shut
  and so shutters shut and shutters and so" ( "CPP," 21-2). The
  shutters "shut and open" just as the film shot both reveals and
  covers in the crisis of a continuous present. Experimental film--and
  Stein's writing--foregrounds this activity, otherwise unnoticeable
  in conventional narrative film, which as Garrett Stewart (<I>Between
  Film and Screen: Modernism's Photo Synthesis</I>) puts it in another
  context, represses the material joining of images in a "successive
  overlapping flow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
  The present urgency of "[n]ot to-day" ("Mrs. Emerson") as well as the
  phrasing of "[s]hutters shut and so and so" ("A Completed Portrait
  of Picasso") accommodates the "[c]lick, clack, lack--in that double
  absentation of the forgone and the just gone past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the bodily pun of "shudders," Stein's portrait of Picasso emerges in
autonomic flickers: "He he he he and he and he and and he and he and he
and he and and as and as he and as he and he" ("CPP," 23). Incremental
repetition of this kind calls for supreme attention by the reader
and threatens a comic forgetfulness, the consequence of slipping up by
covering the same ground. Yet in repeating, Stein mimics the infinitesimal
recuperations necessary for slapstick. (Think of Chaplin's classic clown
fall, legs over the head, followed by his springing upright in opening
road shots in <I>The Tramp.</I>) Bergson sums up how such useless activity
turns comic, albeit abyssal, if still pivoting on a "radical nothing" of
hysteria: "To cover a good deal of ground only to come back unwittingly
to the starting-point, is to make a great effort for a result that is nil"
(<I>L,</I> 80).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, the opening of "Mrs. Emerson," both abstract and irregular,
requires our "distracted attention" in its reiteration of "the regular
way" or the hazardous twists and turns of the moment:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The regular way of instituting clerical resemblances and neglecting
 hazards and bespeaking combinations and heroically and heroically

 celebrations, the certainty, because centre well half full whether it has

 23]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "celebrating instances" and "neglecting hazards," the unanchored
subject in this prose poem paragraph "has forgotten." The repetitions
compel attention to "suffer" and "submit" to "extra changes"; the
wayward circle closes just when the "way" has been forgotten.As with
Stein's rhythmic discontinuities in the above passage, Chaplin's seeming
forgetful body is strategic miscoordination; "neglecting hazards," he
ignores the ever present possibility of falling apart or stumbling into
an unexpected abyss.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such deliberate aimlessness expresses itself in the partiality of gesture,
which Bergson defines as that which expresses "without aim or profit"
and which "slips out unawares, automatic . . . [as] an isolated part of
the person is expressed, unknown to, or at least apart from the whole
of the personality" (<I>L,</I> 129-30). Stein's teacher, William
James, likewise emphasizes "parts" in his delineation of empiricism:
"[It] starts from the parts, and makes of the whole a collection" ("SC,"
10). Perhaps more illuminating to Stein's poetics is James's protofilmic
foreshadowing of Eisenstein's notion of disproportionate intervals: "When
we take a general view of the wonderful stream of our consciousness, what
strikes us first is the different paces of its parts" ("SC," 178). The
interest lies between shots, within the gaps between "paces" and "parts"
that disrupt the illusion of spectatorial wholeness; narrative coherence
relies on concealing the transitive acts of connection. A close-up of
these stepping-stones in "semi-grammatical" structure (to use DeKoven's
sense of Stein's experimental writing) short-circuits linear narrative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  By repeating articles and divesting a sentence of a subject in,
  for instance, "And also and so and so and also," Stein enacts a
  comic rhythm that suspends resolution; there is perhaps no surprise
  in finding "so" in "also" but in sequencing and parsing these phrases
  she makes deliberately unexpected re-turns. <I>Emak Bakia,</I> as does
  "Mrs. Emerson," similarly interprets "the sentiment of movement" as
  serial and fractured in a turn away from mimetic expectations. While
  not overtly comic, the avant- garde film diverts itself in the fragment,
  "turning a corner, then another, and another."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, in the bodily syntax of hysteria, like that of the comic gesture,
the part becomes detachable and reiterable as, according to Grosz,
"[t]he intensity of one zone is displaced onto another bodily zone"
(<I>VB,</I> 77). For her, "[t]his implies that there is a lability of
meaning for the various bodily organs, zones, and processes. Any one zone
of the body can, under certain circumstances, take on the meaning of any
other zone" (<I>VB,</I> 78). Such transposition between bodily regions
suggests forgetfulness, or a kind of anesthesia, that acts as the bodily
equivalent to aesthetic dislocations, or "the coming together of disparate
surfaces," made possible by experimental montage (<I>VB,</I> 198).

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the same issue of <I>Close Up</I> which features Stein's
"Mrs. Emerson," Man Ray describes <I>Emak Bakia</I> as adamantly
serial and partial, a "series of fragments, a cinepoem with a certain
optical sequence [that] make up a whole that still remains a fragment"
("EB<I>,"</I> 40). In language reminiscent of the shutter action of
the camera, he explains "its reasons for being are in its inventions of
light-forms and movements, while the more objective parts interrupt the
monotony of abstract inventions or serve as punctuation" (ibid.). Body
pieces will punctuate, as it were, other defamiliarized images. One
sequence features a close-up of a series of walking women's legs,
seen only partially; as if to disembody their movement, we then see a
quick ghost image of the same legs. Man Ray visceralizes the fragment in
another instance in which Kiki's poised lips punctuate less recognizable
shapes. Immediacy is invoked and then undercut to foreground the mechanism
of repetition and sequencing.

After its swirling title shot, <I>Emak Bakia</I> begins with
a side-view of a man looking through a camera, one with several
lenses that rotate and which are here superimposed on the front of
the image along with the cameraman's physical eye directed at us
(<A HREF="8.3mccabe_3.html"> 3</A>). Immediately, Man Ray
calls attention to the fact, as Sitney observes, that "films are shot
through lenses," the world seen "through layers of glass"; multiple
lenses and filters intervene between eye and object (<I>MM</I>, 29). The
camera does not <I>see</I> or attend, but <I>disassembles.</I> The film
"invents" almost every cinematic device possible to degrade the mimetic
image and to underscore its mechanical materiality, its moment-to-moment
piecing through superimposition, out-of-focus, animation, film reversal,
double-exposure, and rayograms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  Throughout, "revolving kaleidoscopic" movement (to reuse James's
  descriptive phrase) decenters the camera eye as it hypnotizes the
  viewer to the point of dizziness or anesthesia and each film rhythm
  correlates as gestural fragment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rapid motion of the camera, sometimes spun or shaken, denotes
a body both willing its convulsivity and "neglecting hazards." Man
Ray turns the ocean upside down, showing Kiki apparently dead, eyes
painted on her eyelids (replicating the camera's multiple lenses); as
she wakes and her head spins upside down in the last shot of the film,
Man Ray scripts <I>Emak Bakia</I> as "dreamed" rather than willed. As
she opens her eyes, he raises Kiki ratively from the dead. She has
been an unconscious automaton, now upsetting our expectations of bodily
inertness, she partakes of a doubling of the self that Stein refers to in
cases of hysteria. And, as Benjamin suggests, <I>we</I> become implicitly
such automatons when viewing a film and are subject to a "disease of
attention." <I>Emak Bakia,</I> like other experimental films, thus both
"cultivates" and resists psychical displacement by underscoring the very
motor impulses that make the viewing of a film possible. Paradoxically,
the film distracts while it hones our attention.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Emak Bakia</I> foregrounds the cinema as the machine of our time:
capable of rendering simultaneous experience, testing the threshold of
interior and exterior realms, and producing the mechanically-lived body
through motor impulses anchored--but not quite firmly and cohesively--in
consciousness. What can the body do without full

<B></B>

volition, as a mechanized and fractured surface? Notably, Man Ray
describes his film risks in <I>Emak Bakia</I> as bodily ones--vacillating
between chance and conscious volition--in the following account of
filming while being driven in his patron's racing car:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

I was using my hand camera while [Rose Wheeler] was driving eighty or
ninety miles an hour, being pretty badly shaken up, when we came upon a
herd--why not show a collision? I stepped out of the car, followed the
herd while winding up the camera and set it in movement, then threw it
thirty feet up into the air, catching it again. . . . There were other
more carefully planned sequences; a pair of lovely legs doing the popular
Charleston dance of the day, the sea revolving so that it became sky
and the sky sea. [<I>SP,</I> 220]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Stein and Solomons argue in "Cultivated Motor Automatism," automatism
refers to the disjunction between motor impulses and the consciousness of
them as both voluntary and willed. <I>Emak Bakia</I> enacts the detachment
of automatic gesture both from consciousness--the legs mechanically doing
the Charleston--and from linear narrative, making for a belatedness of
recognition. As in the earlier example of double-exposed, spectral legs,
the image recurs in its disappearance<I>.</I> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This quick overview seeks to demonstrate the way <I>Emak Bakia</I>
incarnates a dislocatory consciousness. Like Man Ray's film, Stein's
"Mrs. Emerson" reads as a "cinepoem," demanding that we attend to the
piece's mechanical apparatus, and to

<B></B>

her insistence upon nonpurposive circularity. Rejecting transparency
for the opacity of a screen, she writes, "I will repeat I will not
play windows" ("ME," 25). With the heightened self-consciousness of the
experimental filmmaker piecing together the film, Stein counterpoints
what she "means" and "believes" and "wills" (words repeated throughout)
with disjunctive "shock" images, as with the gender subversive, "I mean to
believe that soldiers order pearls" ("ME," 28). Delighting in dislocation
and multiple lenses, she breaks up attention: "They remembered mentioning,
they saw eight angles, they meant to do mending" ("ME," 29). "Mending"
is willed stitching that offers only intermittent remembering; the
fragment thrives. Stein's physical engagement involves "mounting"
a series of inconclusive resembling shots, as in this telling passage:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I thought that I would state that I knew certainly that she was so seen
that if her eyes were so placed not violently not verbally so placed. She
is not agreeable. She is not so agreeable. I think it is what I said
what I recognized in mounting her. I mounted her there. Deliberate. She
has a son not a son he was a thicker one. I go on. Begun. Bessie is like
Bertha. ["ME," 24, 25]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Where is the <I>there</I> or body being mounted? The passage will "go
on." Stein retracts, modifies and then returns to a deliberate groove of
sonic (and comic) gesture--"son" "son" "one" "begun." Carolyn Burke has
pointed out the sexual overtones of "splice" in relation to Mina Loy,
Stein, and Marianne Moore in its "modalities of joining and separation,
union and disunion." Here, similarly, the embodied, erotic act of
"mounting" suggests the positioning of a camera on a tripod and the
deliberate work of editing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is "placed," as Stein puts it, displaces Ralph Waldo Emerson's
"transparent eyeball" (alluded to by her title), initiating one in
a series of mis-recognitions or slippages in attention. Rather than
mounting a singular subject, "Mrs. Emerson" introduces a number of
resembling and reassembling shapes (as does <I>Emak Bakia,</I> even in its
semianagrammatic title): "Mrs. Evangeline Henderson went in. She said that
the morning. She said that in listening. No I will not be funny" ("ME,"
23). Such comic sentences pivot upon language as mechanistic and serial:
"Please copy this. Others able to copy this. Others able to copy this
after" ("ME," 26). Stein deflects the purposive so that she can combine
"the sentiment of movement" with the "sentiment of getting nowhere."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"I cannot see I cannot see I cannot see. I cannot see" ("ME," 24), she
reiterates. The "I/eye" founders so that she returns to unilluminating
fractured refrain--as in the celebrated scene in <I>The Circus</I> when
Chaplin is lost in a fun house of multiplying mirrors. One of Stein's fun
house mirror sentences reads, "I say I do know Bessie. Bessie resembles
Bertha. Paula resembles Bessie. Bessie resembles Bertha Bessie resembles
Bertha. I do not offer to determine whether Paula and Bertha and Bessie
are distinctly separate" ("ME," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  The spring in this genealogy loses its tension and elasticity in willed
  autonomic gesture and retraction. (When Chaplin exits the fun house to
  evade the police, he camouflages as a mechanical adornment.) Continuity,
  red through disavowed kinship, flickers forth in hysteric jerks:
  "My sister she is not my sister she is my sister" ("ME," 24).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein mounts a skewed "family photo" animated by a paternal crisis:
"Will you give this to your fathers. It is natural without children
natural. They didn't expect that Hannah would be in it. They didn't
expect that he would seem to be sat upon a single piece of cardboard
box" ("ME," 27). Is this the Emersonian father as tramp who "would seem
to be sat upon"? The piece accelerates in this centrifugal revolving:
"One of his brothers the man was descending by his brother. They thought
nothing of it naturally one would have objected. They seemed searchful. It
gives you some arrangement you see" (ibid.). Which brother is which? A
typical comic scenario of doubling and searching abandons plot to
mechanistically give us "some kind of arrangement," "fathers" that are
"brothers," words refracting in resemblance and deflating the paternal,
"I do not care to remember what I do not feather. I do not remember
whether a flavour is farther" (ibid.). The text recalls itself in its
father-feather-flavour-farther rotation (producing something akin to the
rotating prisms in <I>Emak Bakia</I>). By not building towards resolution,
"Mrs. Emerson" wills forgetfulness rather than temporal legacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Man Ray's manipulations of "light forms and movements," as he calls
them, Stein yokes incohesive bodily parts and sensory experience through
synesthesia. She crosses, for instance, erotogenic zone with color: "I do
not say that green is believed to be that color. I do not say that green
makes lips." Or, alternately, she compactly registers the ephemera of
movement, the contiguous scraps within "d&eacute;cor": "Water is coloured
by the sudden departure of all the interested readers of a newspaper."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  In another passage that mimics automatic writing, Stein's roving
  subject displaces the visual and confesses, "I can't help it. I can't
  help hearing carrots. I do help it, I do help it fastening chocolate. A
  secret time in spinning."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  The humor of what can't be helped emphasizes the automatic, the way
  sensory experience (and the chocolate "fix") provokes and can unravel
  bodily reflex even as the mind desires control: "I hope that I select
  that I retain" ("ME," 25).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While "Mrs. Emerson" dramatizes the effort of consciousness to will
selection, Stein insists upon wandering within kinaesthetic mapping,
"I do not select to have similar sounds. Bertha can be surrounded. Bertha
can be surrounded by so much saliva" ("ME," 26). The unexpected jump to
"saliva," to a sign of autonomic, Pavlovian process that "surrounds,"
counterpoints Stein's willed, "selective" arrangement. Mechanical
gesture or utterance here draws into the forefront the choreography of
"kin-aesthetic" experience, its lapses and recoveries. What Stewart calls
"continual splicing on the run," or "cinema's intrinsic dismemberment,"
becomes realized as the body simultaneously forgets and recalls its
temporal viscerality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last lines of "Mrs. Emerson" provide what could be the scenario
for a short abstract film with its "delight in dislocation," its comic,
nonpurposive, shot-by-shot measure:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein makes physical motion, serial and suspended, stand out against
"exceptional white." Desire ("I wish") and volition ("to go and get her")
constantly resume. It is as if she is thinking of the dislocated body,
red here as a Pavlovian dog, responding to "a climbing bell," its
response beginning again and again "all over it." In <I>The Fireman</I>
, a bell similarly automates Chaplin's mechanical body usually
to no avail; his body remembers its reflexes even as he forgets their
purpose. And, again and again, Man Ray's camera animates a detached
motion--Kiki's eyes opening and shutting, for instance--only to join it
with another gestural fragment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, what Bergson found comic in the theater--the use of the
mechanically repeated fragment or monomaniacal trait--takes on
new valence in Stein's cinematic enactment of the modern crisis of
embodiment. Apparently disavowing "the voice" of theater in favor of
the silent film's dislocative body, she declares in "Mrs. Emerson,"
"I do not see why a voice is necessary." She also refers to "silent
rugs" and "late carpet," evoking the tactility of a film screen and
the mounting of fabric ("ME," 26). These references resonate with her
favoring silent film over theater (in the context of Chaplin); the former
"could change the rhythm but if you had a voice accompanying naturally
after that you could never change the rhythm you were always held by the
rhythm the voice gave them" (<I>MM,</I> 160). Stein's allusion to "voice"
here suggests that it inhibits the rhythmic discontinuity of experience,
attempting to provide the hysteric body with a coherent plot.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein and her generation were, therefore, not only "bound by the period
of cinema and series production," but by the fluctuating body of a
continuous present. Stein consciously perceived herself as writing a
form of divagatory cinema with the body as comic/hysteric "repeating
mechanism," her crisis of embodiment bridging the experimental aesthetics
of Man Ray with the popular icon of Chaplin's dislocated body. Film's
spasmodic dance away from causal plot thus reverberates in Stein,
unhinged from destination, a gestural body of malleable mechanics that
interrogates its volition and processes of attention.

While beyond the specific focus of this essay, Stein's negotiation of
trauma and memory manifests itself in her "war poetry." Stein and Alice
B. Toklas volunteered for the American Fund for the French Wounded in
1916; transporting the wounded, they were face-to-face with the physical
effects of war, yet Stein renders eyewitness events from a dissociated,
disjointed perspective. Stein and Toklas spent 1915 to 1916 in Majorca
in retreat from the war, but it remains in view: "Sometimes we look at
boats. When we read about a boat we know that it has been sunk." Gertrude

Benjamin's "conveyer belt" manifests itself vividly in <I>Modern
Times</I> , where Chaplin's body becomes coextensive with the
factory machine. Stein alludes to the potentially anaesthetic effects
of repetition without variation in <I>Making of Americans</I> :
"If they get deadened by the steady pounding of repeating they will not
learn from each one even though each one always is repeating the whole
of them they will not learn the completed history of them, they will
not know the being really in them" (<I>MA,</I> 61). At this juncture,
Stein still aims towards "completion" rather than the fragmentary which,
under the shadow of her "failure" to produce "a complete history of every
one who was or is or will be living," becomes one of her keynotes. She
begins her portrait writing in 1908 when she starts to doubt the idea
of producing the "complete history."

Wagner-Martin, <I>Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family</I>
(New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1995), 112; hereafter

of surrealism, and in fact, espouses notably nonsurrealist tactics, such
as sobriety: "I must be sober. It is so much more exciting to be sober,
to be exact and concentrated and sober" ("PR," 198). Furthermore, even
as she invokes the re of the hysteric, Stein never acknowledges
the psychoanalytic model of the unconscious and the primacy of
dreams so pivotal to Andr&eacute; Breton's "Manifesto of Surrealism"
. Contrastingly, Man Ray is much more closely affiliated with
the surrealist version of the unconscious; his work, nevertheless,
draws upon the mechanistic vision of the body I trace in Stein.

and overwhelming sensory impressions find a counterexample in the
character of Melanctha. Ruddick writes, "James uses the term <I>mind-wandering,</I> or <I>wandering attention</I> to describe such a

enacting the rhythmic divagations of the body moving in space.

The model of the body as impossible machine (a kind of film apparatus),
freakishly capable of engaging in multiple tasks appears in one
of Marianne Moore's delightful footnotes; her Eve "able to write
simultaneously" is inspired by an article that could have been authored by
Stein for all its quirkiness, entitled "Multiple Consciousness or Reflex
Action of Unaccustomed Range" from <I>Scientific American</I> (Jan. 1922):

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Miss A--will write simultaneously in three languages, English, German, and
French, talking in the meantime. [She] takes advantage of her abilities
in everyday life, writing her letters simultaneously with both hands;
names, the first, third, and fifth words with her left and the second,
fourth, and sixth with her right hand. While generally writing outward,
she is able as well to write inward with both hands. [<I>The Complete
Poems of Marianne Moore</I> (New York: Penguin, 1967), 271].

Reminiscent of Stein's exploration of reflex action, Moore's quotation

The interest in "parts" over the whole corresponds to the simultaneous
focusing of attention and break within narrative coherence made possible
by a film close-up. Using the narrative example "of the hero clutching
the revolver with which he is to commit his crime," Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg
points to the power of the close-up: "[o]ur attention is entirely given
up to the passionate play of his hand" where "[i]t is as if this one hand

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is an unlikely title for a history of art, and yet, if we had read
it when and where it first appeared, in England, in mid-June of 1940,
in a little volume by Gertrude Stein called <I>Paris France,</I> we
would perhaps have given it our grim approval.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Paris had just fallen to the Germans, who now occupied virtually all of
  Northern and Central Europe. A couple of weeks earlier, a quarter of a
  million British soldiers had been evacuated from Dunkirk, and Germany's
  designs on England were obvious. German militarism and the ambitions
  of its leaders had done much to twist the century into its misshapen,
  modern form. We could have agreed that "From Bismark to Hitler" was an
  apt title for a great many books--even those concerning subjects that
  writers of an earlier era might not have thought belonged under the
  aegis of a chancellor. Nevertheless, we should pause over the deliberate
  and forceful incongruity of Stein's wry suggestion. Particularly
  coming from this writer who had lived so fully, for so much of her
  life, in contemptuous disregard of explicitly political matters and
  the business of governments, who openly maintained her scorn for the
  "gross t&ecirc;tes," the "big heads [who] are ambitious that is the
  reason they are big heads and so they are at the head of the government
  and the result is misery for the people,"  the idea that Bismarck and
  Hitler might preside, not only over millions of people, but over her
  discussion of art, seems to constitute a terrible concession by Stein
  of her aesthetic domain (<I>PF,</I> 28).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But over the course of her life, Stein comes to understand how the
story of art is also the story of armies, how accounts of artists and
"gross t&ecirc;tes" belong together on the same vexed page. She spends
the last years of her life living in wartime, musing on the causes and
effects and experience of war, and working war into her art and her
theories about art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  I focus in this essay on three selections from her extensive writings
  about the second world war of her lifetime, conscious all the while
  that leaving any of Stein's war writings out of my discussion means that
  I have not addressed the full complexity of her response to that war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  My selections, nevertheless, are <I>Paris France,</I> written before
  the German invasion of her adopted country, and two pieces she wrote
  after the defeat of Germany: an essay for <I>Life</I> magazine titled
  "Off We All Went to See Germany" , and her final composition,
  published posthumously in the <I>Yale Poetry Review,</I> "Reflection on
  the Atomic Bomb" . Although the works are written for different
  audiences, and although they bracket the war's beginning and ending,
  they all display Stein's understanding of war as an especially vehement
  and large-scale manifestation of difference. Literally, of course,
  those differences are geopolitical and military, and they occur between
  and within nations. But when Stein writes about war, other differences
  become crucial as well--between private and public spheres, between
  past and present, between childhood and adulthood, between her own
  and others' points of view. Words themselves take on different meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I frame my discussion of Stein's World War II writing by first looking
briefly at concepts she develops before that second war, in texts
written during the 1920s and 1930s. The peculiar view of World War II
through Stein's eyes cannot be understood without first understanding her
often anguished meditations--composed for the most part following the
publication of <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I> in 1933--on
audience and intimacy, on self-possession and the self dispersed,
on writing with and without reference, on being read by a necessarily
alien public as well as by the few who know her. Insofar as Stein's
war writings have received attention at all (and that attention has,
with a few exceptions, only begun within the past few years), this late
work has been insufficiently linked to her earlier texts. There has also
been an understandable tendency to read Stein's war work in terms that,
while of great importance, are ultimately limiting. Recent discussions
of Stein in France have rested on attempts to decide and evaluate what
political position (or positions) she held during the war. Readers
in our own time generally want first to determine which side she took
(or why she refused to take sides), and how extensively she benefited
from the protection of the Vichy government. They ask whether aspects
of her own theory and artistic practice can be said to carry political
meaning. And how fully does she reflect the continually shifting attitudes
of the French themselves--as collaborators, resistors, and the majority
of those who stood equivocally somewhere in between?
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  I by no means want to foreclose reading Stein's wartime writing as
  part of an important contemporary exploration of the problems of
  allegiance in occupied France, but I want also to expand the terms of
  the discussion of these texts beyond specific, historical questions
  of collaboration. For Stein, the phenomenon of war is a manifestation
  and crucial cause of the excitements and horrors of modernity. These
  excitements and horrors are as much

<B></B>

aesthetic and ontological as they are sociopolitical and military. And
in her intimate conjoining of the realms of war and art, Stein displays
her modernity every bit as fully as she does in her gnostic, avant-garde
writings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
War emerges with startling centrality in "Composition as
Explanation"--Stein's lecture delivered in 1926 to undergraduates
at Oxford and Cambridge. There is little in Stein's preceding work,
or in immediate, contemporary circumstances to explain the pivotal
presence of war in this speech. Ulla Dydo suggests that Stein makes her
analogy between aesthetic and martial innovation in an effort to close
"a generation gap between her audience and herself," but I do not find
this explanation convincing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  It is more plausible to understand the introduction of the Great War
  not as a bid for the attention of the young so much as a carefully
  thought-out explanation for the shape of society and the domain of
  art in the years after 1919. For Stein, modernity and the war that
  brings the twentieth century wholly into "the modern composition"
  derives from conflict, when a peaceful, homogeneous state is broken by
  the introduction of something different: "Everything alike naturally
  everything was simply different and this is and was romanticism
  and this is and was war" ("CE," 501). "Romanticism," in addition
  to referring somewhat loosely to early-nineteenth-century English
  poetry, names the fact of division, the introduction of difference
  into any system--aesthetic, political, psychological. It is important
  to understand that she connects these systems. The writer who would
  name her art history "From Bismark to Hitler" is the writer who insists
  that changes in one sphere mean changes in others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Her <I>Lectures in America</I> will show Stein developing at great length
a geographical history--the phrase is hers--that ties the characteristics
of a nation's art closely to the exposure of that nation to difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  In her explanatory narrative, most extensively laid out in the
  lecture titled "What is English Literature," England grows less
  and less self-contained as time progresses, beginning to enter its
  modern state of being with the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. By
  1815, "England" no longer designates an island and the comparatively
  homogeneous group of people living within that island's limited bounds
  but points instead, disconcertingly, to an empire either being built,
  or maintained, or falling apart far beyond the island's shores. English
  writing consequently suffers, because it now needs to answer to so
  many different demands.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Stein is nominally an American, and she tours her native country
with a lecture on the problems of English literature in part so that
she can offer to her audiences the answer to modernity provided
by their own writers, their own culture. Since America is not an
island and since, in Stein's telling of history, it is not a country
engaged in the exhausting, impossible labor of maintaining an empire,
it has never had to deal with the traumatic violation of inside by
outside. Immigration leads to incorporation; it does not result in a
nation divided against itself. Clearly, Stein is telling her lettered
audience of students, patrons of art, intellectuals, and members of the
social elite a comforting story about unity across classes and cultures
at a time still cast in the shadow of the Great Depression in a country
ferociously divided by difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Her description of America as having been always and fundamentally
  alone, disconnected from the rest of the world, also suits the
  isolationist temper of the decade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Here is a nation

<B></B>

that cannot but be uninvolved in the world's increasingly troubling
affairs. And for Stein herself, whose anxieties surrounding exposure
and connectedness to a general public are so powerful as to bring her
writing career to a crisis following the widespread success of <I>The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  a claim of her American heritage stands as a bid for remaining
  unassailably beyond everything:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the disembodied way of disconnecting something from anything and anything
from something was the American one. . . . Some say that it is repression
but no it is not repression it is a lack of connection, of there being
no connection with living and daily living because there is none, that
makes American writing what it always has been and what it will continue
to become.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ironically, of course, the very fact that Stein gives this talk and the
other five that she assembles under the heading <I>Lectures in America</I>
to audiences nationwide--audiences that subject her to nonstop, if
largely adoring scrutiny during her tour--demonstrates how extensively
she is connected to her public. Her overwhelming interest in the issues
attending embodiment makes perfect sense. Her second autobiography,
<I>Everybody's Autobiography</I> , centrally concerned with
"What Happened After <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I>"
(the title of the book's opening chapter) and with the American tour,
reveals on virtually every page Stein's sense of exposure, particularly
as she traveled in her native land.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  She remains always on display, in texts that can be read and reread
  by strangers, and in her own person as she stands before those
  strangers. The fact and conditions of her lecture tour create a
  principal subject for those lectures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We cannot forget, further, that Stein lives in France rather than England
or America--on the European continent, not on an island or a landmass
effectively protected by oceans. If we return to her discussion of war
and modernity in "Composition as Explanation," we realize that, far from
living composed in an "American" state of removal from connections of
all kinds, Stein has experienced most of this century in what she calls
her "romantic" country rather than the one where she "belongs"--center
stage in the theater of world war--and war remains the most appallingly
powerful means by which difference is made violently manifest on a large
scale (<I>PF,</I> 2). The "romanticism" of 1914-8 has brought her
brutally into modernity. There is much in "Composition as Explanation"
that might be read simply as aesthetic theory, but we can feel the sharp
edge of Stein's satirical characterization of her century as she describes
how war dragged millions of people to an unarguably modern state:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And so there was the natural phenomenon that was war . . . [which itself]
became completely contemporary and so created the completed recognition
of the contemporary composition. Every one but one may say every one
became consciously became aware of the existence of the authenticity of
the modern composition. . . . And so war may be said to have advanced
a general recognition of the expression of the contemporary composition
by almost thirty years. ["CE," 501]

<B></B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein utters these sentences to men of ting age, in a community
decimated by the Great War, in a climate filled with the most scathing
reflections on the pointlessness of the global conflict of a decade
earlier, started and scandalously mismanaged by old men from another era
altogether. We recognize here the same dark wit that would lodge Bismark
and Hitler in the title of a book on art. What has been "advanced" to
"every one"--notice the understated comedy of the emphasis Stein places on
"every one" ("but one may say every one")--is the violent understanding of
difference as it manifests itself in invasion, attack, conflict ending
in death, the redrawing of maps, cultural and political revolution,
and social and aesthetic change of unparalleled rapidity and scope.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The painful challenge that wartime conditions force on Stein is in
important respects a challenge that she has been struggling with ever
since the publication of <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.</I> Does
she choose to stand before an audience, uttering explanations and opinions
and answers, exposing herself to queries, engaging in conversations,
using language primarily as an instrument for communication? Or does
she refuse to debase her medium and to violate her privacy, writing
instead purely with the aim of putting words in lively combinations on
the page, purging her mind--and, ideally, the minds of her readers--of
thoughts about what these words mean, whether they make a story, how
they relate to our ordinary world? She pursues both courses, often in
dizzying alternations on a single page. And the stakes attending this
double choice are extraordinarily high. By the summer of 1940, invasion
and occupation are no longer only psychologically inflected res for
the experiences of writing and being read. Outside breaks in; Germany
overruns France. Although Stein continues to believe that her highest
calling is the writing she does without reference to daily living, from
1939 through 1945 she works under the inevitable pressures placed upon
a writer to respond to the threat and then the actuality of invasion and
the newly importunate facts of daily existence that follow. She now feels
compelled to bear some kind of witness, to tell her story about the war
she sees, and to satisfy an American public--brought largely into being
by <I>The Autobiography</I>--with accounts of life in occupied France.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's vacillation between reference and antireferential writing
constitutes one of her idiosyncratic strengths as a writer about war,
even as it leaves her vulnerable to charges of carelessness in the face
of urgent, demonstrable human suffering.  All of her texts written during
World War II are marked by an aesthetically, morally, and emotionally
volatile instability. Examples are everywhere; I offer one from <I>Paris
France</I>:

I like words of one syllable, and it works out very well in the French
order for general mobilization. The printed thing gives all the detail

<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It "works out very well" if one reads this proclamation of nationwide
conscription purely as a collection of words on a government notice
(and if the reader is not a man of conscriptable age). Here, as is so
often the case, Stein courts furious accusations from

<B></B>

readers who are more directly caught up either in the machinery of war
itself or who will resent as unpatriotic this aesthetic attention to
words instead of a more direct embrace of their stirring reference to
battle. She sustains criticism from both groups throughout the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  But she deliberately refuses to be "mobilized" herself by the
  government's martial rhetoric. She maintains a skepticism about the act
  of making war and the ways language can be used to promote war. She
  recognizes facts about life in wartime that an ardent defender of
  any particular side or cause might not see or might not allow him or
  herself to register in writing. Her careful observation of the details
  of life in occupied France constitutes an unusual and important act
  of witnessing, without the obtrusive presence of the author guiding us
  through an illustrated argument. As she stares at this "printed thing,"
  she is not attempting to explain, shape opinion, appeal to familiar
  systems of ethics, influence political or military choices. In this
  particular form of disengagement, her work is unusual among war memoirs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's body of work on the war matters in part because it explores, in
the most unpropitious circumstances imaginable, a late and especially
explicit iteration of a modernist aesthetic dream: the creation in
language, by an author who has effectively vanished--inviolate behind the
words on the page--of a system of relations that does not tell a story,
of words moving but never falling into narrative and never, therefore,
pulling us into the human, all-too-human world where cause and effect
brings with it responsibility and anxiety and hope and, ultimately, mortal
ends. Stein's war writing also matters for the opposite but profoundly
allied reason that we can discover on her pages powerfully realized
portraits of life in wartime. And the final irony pertaining to Stein's
divided aims and her writing that is often so utterly at odds with itself
lies in the fact that every writer's attempt to narrate purposefully
experience during war founders as it confronts events that cannot be told,
experiences that refuse grammatical parsing and the shapes of narration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Her reasons for joining this numerous company of necessary failures
  are idiosyncratic in the extreme. And yet there on her pages are the
  rhetorical effects she regularly achieves in her misshapen, interrupted,
  jarringly framed and therefore deeply expressive sentences about World
  War II.

Peace and Quiet on the Western Front: Paris France and the Phony War
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Written in the bizarre months of late 1939 and early 1940, during which
her adopted country declares war in September and then waits for an
attack that does not come until the following May, <I>Paris France</I>
stands in many respects as the war book of Stein's that captures the
most recognizably widespread sense of the times in France.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Once France falls to the Germans, Stein's perspective on events
  grows increasingly personal, though it remains accurate to the
  peculiar experience of life for the French after armistice, under
  occupation. Following the Allies' declaration of war against Germany
  on 3 September, the fall and winter in both England and France--a
  period journalists soon named "the phony war"--was marked by a surreal
  combination of normalcy and frantic preparations for battle. Expecting
  immediate German air raids, both countries placed themselves under
  blackout, pursued plans for evacuations of women and children

<B></B>

from major cities, restricted civilian movement and issued gas masks. They
changed radio programming to music interrupted only by occasional
announcements, set up home defense squadrons, had city inhabitants digging
trenches for shelter, and made numerous other provisions for self-defense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  But the expected attack failed to materialize and restrictions
  relaxed. Life shifted, as the fall progressed, to a strange mixture of
  waiting in anxious preparedness and resuming something like ordinary
  daily living. Though a great many sentences of <I>Paris France</I> take
  an ironic inflection and can even seem grotesquely off the mark when
  the book is read after its publication date in June of 1940--the Nazis
  having entered Paris on the fourteenth of June--Stein writes her book
  when France is living in this indeterminate time before the arrival of
  the Germans. War is a fact, but it has not yet fully arrived. Poland
  falls by October, Finland ts the Soviets through the winter, the
  German army invades Denmark and Norway in April, but France remains
  untouched. "Paris, France," she tells us in her first sentence, "is
  exciting and peaceful" (<I>PF,</I> 1). Ever since <I>Three Lives,</I>
  Stein has been composing sentences around the copula that splinter when
  we arrive at their predicates. Briefly, now, she is just describing
  the way things are. She has spent much of her writing life considering
  how often a single subject comprises contradictory states of being,
  reflecting on the plural and uncertain ways we occupy any temporally
  located moment. She proves astonishingly well prepared to describe
  the limbo of the phony war as many lived it in France.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The country that takes shape on the pages of <I>Paris France</I> seems
virtually immune to the motions of time. Stein writes to assure herself
and her readers that little has happened or can ever happen in this place,
as though she were performing a comforting stroll through an undamaged
garden between dramatic but ultimately inconsequential storms. Hers
is a pre-industrial, agrarian France that follows rhythms too deeply
ingrained to be affected by mere politics or the martial doings of
certain men. "[W]hat is was and what was is," she insists: "the season
and fashions that exist with the seasons are the things France lives
by, the earth has its seasons and the people who live on that earth
have fashions and that is all" (<I>PF,</I> 24, 28-9). Imbued with
the rhythms of Ecclesiastes, Stein's sentences inflexibly connect the
French with the earth and with the least instrumental, least necessary
human pursuit imaginable: fashion. French people in this book are either
absorbed in attending to their most basic physical requirements--procuring
food, clothing, and shelter--or they are deliberately preoccupied by the
most frivolous concerns--the design of hats, say, or the ways of their
dogs. Fashion, the behavior of animals, and the needs of the body matter
enormously to Stein and to the French because these things are still
disconnected from the emergencies of the time (though this disconnection
will not be sustainable once the invasion begins). "Poetry makes nothing
happen," Auden wrote in February of this same year
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 --a time when the laws of cause and effect themselves at times seem
 weirdly suspended--and Stein celebrates a disengagement that has long
 been considered the province of the aesthetic: "Now all these dogs being
 of no use can be made fashionable, because fashion must never be useful,
 must very often be exotic, and must always be made to be french. That
 is what fashion is and it must change" (<I>PF,</I> 35). For the first
 half of

<B></B>

<I>Paris France,</I> fashion seems to be the only thing that changes--or
the only change that is worth noticing. When those changes come,
furthermore, they arise essentially without agency. Like all of the
productions of genius in Stein's scheme of the world's operations,
fashions cannot properly be attributed to conscious design.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  They happen almost by accident, as natural phenomena occur, regular as
  the seasons--predictable, mildly surprising in their minute variations,
  and consoling: "And so there is no use going on, except that the
  summers follow one after the other and the fashions go with the
  seasons" (<I>PF,</I> 28). "Fashion" comes to mean a great deal more,
  too, than the way clothes hang on a body. Stein increases the domain
  of fashion, of perceived form, so radically in <I>Paris France</I>
  that wars themselves somehow seem like hemlines or the cut of a man's
  jacket--cyclically linked, following a design, echoing one another
  in a way that brings a dark kind of comfort to the stolid, stoical
  French. The fall days of 1939 are shadowed by those of 1914. Resigned,
  the French find pattern, not progress, repetition rather than evolution:
  "And now it is once more an August and September and there is once more
  a crisis and once more the farmers the gentle farmers talk about life
  as it is" (<I>PF,</I> 27). This is a land that cannot be understood in
  historical terms. It is instead a place of the perpetual present tense:
  "And so France cannot change it can always have its fashions but it
  cannot change" (<I>PF,</I> 33).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But a realm locked this completely into timelessness can become difficult
to distinguish from a land of the dead. <I>Paris France</I> is haunted
by death, which exists as an imminent possibility and an immanent fact
of life in wartime. French life exhibits much of the changelessness of a
work of art or, more particularly, a monument. Its people move as though
choreographed, caught in the earth's ritual embrace. We find ourselves
pondering a country that has already lost the war because resisting
seems beside the point. France has resigned itself to invasion, given
itself over to a life that exhibits few vital signs:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

And then the way they feel about the dead, it is so friendly so simply

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this eternally ancient nation from which the twentieth century grows,
among the fatalistic citizens who will pass mildly away, children become
the locus for Stein's characterization of the costs and the effects of
war. When <I>Paris France</I> shifts from descriptions of the country
and its place in history to an attempt to address the experience of
wartime more directly, Stein turns our attention to a little girl who
lives near her in the village of Bilignin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  She makes the shift to childhood for several reasons. Her understanding
  of space and time has long deliberately retained something of the
  flexibility, the synchronicity of a child's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Those who live in the state of temporal suspension that characterizes
  late 1939 and early 1940 in France live to some degree outside of time's
  ordinary progress, as children do. They seem to be equally helpless,
  as well, unable to control whatever is about to happen. This village
  girl also allows Stein to examine her

<B></B>

own earlier days as a writer. Using the girl's name as a trigger for her
backward glance, Stein returns, in a textual representation of memory,
to a prior form of art--what has become, by 1939, one of her most famous
instances of avant-garde, noninstrumental writing--now measured against
words differently employed. One of Stein's strategies for assessing the
meaning of the coming of war is to see what happens when a word slips
from a wholly linguistic field of play into a time, a place, a body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The word is "Button." It has gone from part of a title--<I>Tender
Buttons</I>--to a girl's last name: Helen Button. But before we listen to
Helen's wartime experience, we must first recall the sketch that famously
opens <I>Tender Buttons,</I> under the heading "Objects." Stein presents
us with the portrait of an object that is comparatively impervious
to time:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tensions between the familiar and the strange in this passage will
return to haunt Helen Button. Even the ordinary attributes of this
carafe have turned unsettling: the adjective "blind" disconcertingly
suggests the possibility of the object becoming a subject capable of
returning our scrutiny, just as "hurt" may point ratively to color
but gestures also toward a body. Though this object is "not unordered
in not resembling," though it has discernible form, is an "arrangement
in a system to pointing," we are not initiated into the design of that
system, the category in which its lack of resemblance would seem merely
another instance of order. Different from expectations, familiar as kin
and cousin might seem, but also, if looked at again or awry, less than
kind, less known than novel, this carafe is a spectacle whose hard-edged
indeterminacies threaten to overwhelm the observer and the observer's
methods for making sense: "The difference is spreading."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we watch Helen Button staring at a kindred object in <I>Paris
France</I>--as though she were looking at one of the items from <I>Tender
Buttons</I> transposed, twenty-five years later, on the eve of the next
war, to a village in Southeastern France--we witness her transformation
from a little girl to a character in a story by Stein: "We have had here
in the village a little girl and her name is H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bouton,
Helen Button" (<I>PF,</I> 80).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bouton's imperfect reflection in Helen Button
  signals the difference between life and narrative and inaugurates
  a double act of recollection--of a French girl and of a highly
  charged English word from Stein's prior text that shares Helen's last
  name. Stein undertakes the complex act of recollection emphasizing that
  all portraits should take the measure of and unfold self-consciously in
  time, particularly when time carries such heavy freight: "because after
  all this war is not war," she adds in her opening, "it is war-time"
  (<I>PF,</I> 80). This war is "not war" because it has commenced without
  fully, violently beginning in earnest for the French. All of Stein's
  writings about war will explore the myriad ways in which the state of
  wartime itself can at once seem

<B></B>

all-encompassing and wholly irrelevant to anyone living during war. Every
sentence in her work that measures the full effect of living under war's
terrible dispensations is followed shortly by a companion sentence that
shows the subject virtually untouched by circumstances we associate with
conflict. And not only does Stein underscore her subject's divided modes
of being in time. She also encourages us to look beyond particulars, so
that the local H&eacute;l&egrave;ne becomes the more general, more textual
Helen, who lives not simply in late 1939 but in a widespread historical
condition we call "war-time," stretching back even to the <I>Iliad,</I>
where we will also find this girl's name. "She lived somewhere," Stein
impatiently assures us, knowing that we will naturally gravitate toward
the pathos of a specific case history and thereby be likely to miss the
even more sobering truth that there are millions of Helens existing
in time and space, their fates echoing across the centuries like the
ticking of a clock. "[B]ut the thing that is important is that she
lived during war-time. There is a great deal of war-time in history
and Helen Button lived in it" (<I>PF,</I> 81). Stein introduces her
portrait as a story about "what a child's feeling about war-time is"
(<I>PF,</I> 80). Helen Button, we find, has spent many of her days and
nights anxiously immersed in history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's story of Helen occupies ten enormously complex pages of <I>Paris
France,</I> and yet it is with the first, deliberately framed narration
of an event in Helen Button's life that her last name and the event
together recall <I>Tender Buttons.</I> Stein now restages the opening
of her earlier work, providing us with an object and a perceiving subject:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Helen Button started out with her dog William. As they were walking along
 suddenly William stopped and was very nervous. He saw something on the
 road and so did Helen. They neither of them knew what it was at first
 and at last as they approached very carefully they saw it was a bottle,
 a bottle standing up right in the middle of the road. There had been
 something in the bottle but what, it looked dark green or may be blue
 or black, and the bottle was standing up in the middle of the road,
 not lying on its side the way a bottle on the road usually is.
<BR>
William the dog and Helen the little girl went on. They did not look
 back at the bottle. But of course it was still there because they had
 not touched it.
<BR>
That is war-time. [<I>PF,</I> 82]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage resists reading as forcefully as did its antecedent in
<I>Tender Buttons</I>. And this kindred moment is explicitly concerned
with the effects of that resistance on two emblematical interpreters who
share nervousness though their differences from each other extend even to
their species. The familiar open vista of the road suddenly contracts
around an object needing to be deciphered, threatening in its pure
opacity. That mere object, the bottle of indeterminate color, demands
interpretation because Helen and William are searching for what Stein,
three paragraphs earlier, has called "signs" that will orient them in
their ominously unfolding presents. The somehow crucial difference--that
this bottle stands up rather than lying on its side--seems fraught with
meaning in part because there is so little to interpret, so little to
hold on to in this scene that epitomizes Helen and William's continually
menacing, largely uneventful lives in wartime.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference, too, between this nonincident and "A CARAFE THAT IS
A BLIND GLASS" augments its already considerable power. When Stein's
object returns on this road, changed but related to a precedent object in
<I>Tender Buttons,</I> and when we watch this girl and her dog equally
though differently afraid of its possible significance, we confront
a representative anxiety about failing to make meaning. Circumstances
demand interpretation but leave us with insufficient points of reference
by which we might venture to make sense of things. <I>Tender Buttons</I>
does not stand as a key in relation to this later scene; the echoes
do not help us read this different world. Our own acts of recollection
simplify nothing. Brooding over history is as existentially mystifying
to Stein as is being in the present, but those twin mystifications are
most upsetting and most obvious during war. The comforting appositives,
"the dog" and "the little girl" try, with only partial success, to
reassemble William and Helen after their misadventure. But the bottle,
Stein carefully insists, opening a space in her narrative for memory's
continued, hysterical workings, "was still there because they had not
touched it." Helen and William do not look over their shoulders, but the
narrative glances back, forcing us to acknowledge that the impervious
object remains to be recalled. Being in wartime exacerbates the tendency
for the subject to fall into a seemingly infinite variety of disorders,
leaving the inner and outer interpretable worlds incoherent, filled
only with difference and unspeakable absences. The faculty of memory
allows (or is <I>condemns</I> a better word?) the repeated return to
these moments of difference, just as this brief scene circles back on
itself. Stein's sketch of the displaced Helen and William holds out to
them and to her readers the possibility, at once terrible and promising,
of recollection. Not looking at the bottle but seeing it all the same,
they know that there is something--a world--still there "because they
had not touched it."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the story of Helen Button in wartime continues, Stein displays, in the
compressed narrative of her character's life, experiences and patterns
of thought that will characterize her subsequent writing about the
war. Helen's is a world where no relation--between people, with animals,
with objects themselves, and even with the ostensible enemy--can be relied
upon; where the urge to embrace prophecies, or hold to any system of signs
that will allow the comforting sense that the future is foreknown and
follows a plan is continually offset by even the most ordinary, expected
events going wrong; where the laws of cause and effect seem suspended;
where the familiar turns horrific and the anticipated nightmare does
not materialize. Helen watches her friend Emil's dog, Ellen, "changing
and her fur turned into large baggy trousers and her head turned into
a large shaggy head and it was a man, an enemy man" (<I>PF,</I> 86).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  She clings to her Aunt Pauline, who knows what the future holds--an
  extremely consequential gift of sight in these days, since "in
  war-time anything might happen so it was very necessary to know it"
  (<I>PF,</I> 87).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  When the unexpected does occur (Aunt Pauline's lucidity has no
  observable effect on this story), consequences remain puzzling. Helen's
  dog is hit by a car: "The automobile came on, it went over William
  and Helen screamed and William was down and then he was up and then
  away he went, oh how he did go" (<I>PF,</I> 89). Shortly after this
  misadventure, a wagon comes by, carrying an unidentified "animal":
  "nobody had ever seen any animal like it before, it was enormous

<B></B>

and it was dead. . . . The enormous animal did not have a tail and it did
not have any ears. It was an enormous animal and it was war-time. Helen
did not really see it but she told herself about it" (<I>PF,</I>
89-90). The last event in the story of Helen Button's life is,
fittingly, her encounter with the enemy. Modernity and life within "the
modern composition," to use Stein's phrase, means living exiled from
the quiet confines of an imagined and secure self, without an island
haven, lacking words alone. To be modern is to be forced, perhaps as one
writes for a general public or gives lectures before anonymous audiences,
often by the frightfully effective mechanism of war, into contact with
the irreducible mystery of others. It is to live always in the state of
wondering "who goes there?" Helen and Emil, her French friend with the
German name, see a young man on a nearby hill with a spy glass. They
decide on a patriotic course of action:

She grieves for herself and her precarious condition, for the vacuity

the question of this stranger's allegiance than it will establish the
meaning of the bottle in the road, and that going away makes as much
sense as any other choice she and Emil might have taken, though it
accomplishes nothing. She is still young, and the war continues, but she
now understands all that can be known of her condition, "So for her,"
Stein explains, "war-time was over" (<I>PF</I>, 92). In the same bleak
but resolved frame of mind, Stein casts a glance back over what she has
just written and concludes, "So this is the twentieth century" (ibid.).

One of the most terrible aspects of Stein's portrait of Helen Button
is that the girl vanishes in tears from Stein's narrative, never to
reappear. Triumph over the enemy does not form part of her story. Stein,
on the other hand, experiences the complex euphoria of liberation. I
turn now to two pieces she wrote after V-E Day, one describing a trip
she takes to Germany with the United States Army, the other containing
her thoughts about the atomic bomb. Jean Gallagher who, in <I>The World
Wars Through the Female Gaze,</I> discusses a number of Stein's World
War II writings, argues that, "In

<B></B>

Stein's postliberation writing, not only do we see a marked turn toward
more detailed visual description and a willingness to interpret visual
data for readers, but we also see how Stein participates in a militarized
gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  It is certainly true that Stein's <I>Wars I Have Seen</I> records the
  coming of the Americans in greatest detail and vehemently celebrates
  the Allied victory. I do not agree, however, that she allows herself
  to see more clearly or with increased specificity--in this text or
  in others written in 1945-6--than she did before the arrival
  of her countrymen. Nor, I think, does Stein consistently write
  with an interpretive certainty she lacked before the defeat of the
  Germans. Rather, I suggest, the United States press catches her up
  in its representations for the American public of the liberation of
  France. Her writing about the war and her attitude toward the coming of
  the Americans make national news. So powerful are the public narratives
  of victory, and so compelling is the story of this artist's liberation,
  that Stein finds herself speaking (and being quoted) in public venues
  that discourage ambiguity, even though she herself continues to
  interrogate the war and its legacies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  The war correspondents, Eric Sevareid and Frank Gervasi, report Stein's
  "liberation" to the American press; stories about her are carried in
  many American periodicals; Stein herself makes a broadcast to America.

  Coming out of her necessary retreat in the French countryside during
  the war, Stein is thrust back into the public eye as fully as she was
  after the <I>Autobiography</I> was published. And she measures that
  publicity and the consequences of victory every bit as thoughtfully
  as she weighed the success and the effects of her own prose in the
  mid-1930s. She lives now, at the end of the European war, in a time of
  resolutions, when so many are busily providing answers and explanations
  and retrospective interpretations. Her own project in this last year
  of the war becomes a questioning of conclusions. What she demonstrates
  again, in this next phase of her writing about the war, is her ability
  to capture the essential oddity of war and its aftermath. Few writers
  can speak with such peculiar authority about the surreal in the ordinary
  and the ordinary in what we thought was apocalyptic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's most explicit return to her mass audience occurs in her appearance

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is a great deal of humor in this essay, and it is humor of a kind
that is likely to meet with the approval of Stein's American readers:
"But Bob, I said, I don't like Germans, I saw enough of them in France
I don't want to see them at home" (ibid.). She assures us, by the end
of the first paragraph, that we need not be concerned that we will hear
too much about Hitler's defeated nation: "And I really pretty well forgot

<B></B>

about Germany and the Germans in the enormous pleasure of living
intimately with the American Army" (<I>Life</I>, 54). The essay already
begins to complicate its ostensible purpose. This will be a visit to
see Germany in which not many Germans and not much of the country needs
to be seen. She reduces that country to a nonentity in prose that is
startling in its simplicity, as innocent of martial fervor or vengeful
pleasures as the musings of Helen Button or her friend Emil. The editors
of <I>Life</I> smile at her throughout, adding a section heading,
for example, to her observations about the effects of Allied bombs on
Cologne. "Roofs are important, yes," the editor of Stein's essay agrees
with Stein, in pleased condescension at her own description:

But Stein maintains her own integrity, her distinction from the
editorial point of view, simply by recording her observations in her own
style--a style that continues to demonstrate how tentative is the act of
witnessing, how little we can harvest from our gleaning of the world. With
the victory of the Allies comes an endless string of documentary accounts
and photographs and films that promise to bring us closer to the facts of
the war in Europe. Stein is a cautious, canny member of this documentary
assembly. The photograph that introduces her article weirdly illustrates
the questions, at once visual and ethical, raised by much of her writing
about the war (<A HREF="8.3whittier-ferguson_1.html"> 1</A>). How
much does this witness see? How much does she know about the surrounding
world, and how fully does she respond to that world? Stein and Toklas
"see the Rhine," the picture's caption assures us, but due to an
accident of lighting, we see not the view from a window but a framed,
black square. The image provides an unsettling introduction to a piece

  It is precisely these canny aesthete's eyes, however, through which

  destructive action and these two older women who have given their
  lives to art and to a sheltered, somewhat unorthodox but fundamentally
  bourgeois domesticity, this article presents us with a deliberate
  respite from anguished journalism. In its place we are given a small
  collection of impressions and disarmingly direct commentary on the
  causes of and antidotes to war from one of the very first postwar
  tourists in Germany. Stein herself comes to understand her unique status
  shortly after her arrival in Frankfurt, as she discovers the Germans
  looking not at the American soldiers but at "Miss Toklas and myself":

In an eerie, war-inflected reprise of her return to Oakland in April
1935, when she found "no there there," the central purpose of Stein's
trip to Germany is to discover emptiness, to find no record of titanic
personalities, to see only surfaces and hollow shells of bombed-out
buildings, to take a tour, yes, but to find virtually nothing on the trip.

Modris Eksteins has recently published an essay on war tourism, focusing
primarily on tour guides and accounts of travel after the First World
War. Eksteins documents the phenomenon of postwar tourists and tour
promoters, arguing that "the sight of civilization in ruin produces
. . . an interesting mix of piety and titillation, of rumination and
excitement."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Stein's quick trip to Germany cannot offer such sublime and

<B></B>

suspect emotional satisfactions, since she finds little in the faculty of
memory worth attending to--of what use, then, would ruins be? Whatever
titillating horror this journey does have to offer must come when Stein
reaches her journey's destination--Hitler's mountain retreat in the
Alpine town of Berchtesgaden.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  The photograph of her in this spot comes at the close of the <I>Life</I>
  essay (<A HREF="8.3whittier-ferguson_2.html"> 2</A>). To
  understand this photograph and the account Stein gives of the occasion
  it commemorates, we should remember that, in 1945, there were a number
  of senior Allied officers and intelligence staff who feared that Hitler
  and his remaining followers would make a last, bloody stand in the
  "Mountain Redout" of Berchtesgaden. The town and Hitler's sanctuary
  had become saturated, in the imaginations of soldiers and civilians,
  with the horrors of the Third Reich.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is the aura of this place that allows Stein her metonymic description
of the next stage of her journey: "off we went to Hitler" (<I>Life,</I>
57). But those five words, which ring with the declarative simplicity of
a nightmare, introduce us instead to the most surprising scene of whimsy:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
there we were in that big window where Hitler dominated the world a bunch
of GIs just gay and happy. It really was the first time I saw our boys
really gay and careless, really forgetting their burdens and just being
foolish kids, climbing up and around and on top, while Miss Toklas and
I sat comfortably and at home on garden chairs on Hitler's balcony. It
was funny it was completely funny, it was more than funny it was absurd
and yet so natural. [Ibid.]

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's long-famous simplicity of diction now serves as a measure of
the Allied victory. So completely has Hitler been defeated that where
he once ruled soldiers can become children again, and aging women
find ordinary comfort. The prepositions, "up and around and on top,"
speak of liberation and the license to be in places formerly forbidden,
places grown-ups aren't usually allowed to go. Stein cannot avoid calling
attention to the wonder of this scene--Mother Goose and her gay charges
in the now-domesticated heart of darkness--"it was more than funny it
was absurd."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This self-consciousness becomes literally manifest in the moment we see
frozen in the photograph. As though the pressure of absurdity strikes the
whole company simultaneously, Stein reports that "we all got together
and pointed as Hitler had pointed" (<I>Life,</I> 57). Their collective
pose not only mimes the commanding gesture Hitler might have made as
he surveyed his country (and, by implication, the world far beyond his
field of vision). The angle of their raised arms and outstretched hands
also suggests the Sieg Heil salute itself--one of the most powerfully
iconographic gestures of the past century--now turned into the merest
assumption of an attitude. As Gallagher points out, this gesture displays
"an impulse toward mimetic and iconographic outrage," but she adds that
"Stein allies herself visually not only with the victorious American
soldiers but also with the stance of victory itself," and thus "the
female observer's vision is effectively absorbed into the trajectory of
the military gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  I suggest that Stein by no means fits so easily into the soldiers'
  company, much as she takes pleasure in horsing around with them in
  the photograph. Her very next gesture sets her apart again, as she
  continues to skew the signs of war in the souvenir hunting that follows
  this anti-salute:

What I wanted was a radiator, Hitler did have splendid radiators, and
there was one all alone which nobody seemed to notice, but a radiator a
large radiator, what could I do with it, they asked put it on a terrace
and grow flowers over it, I said. [<I>Life</I>, 57]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The elegiac associations that might cluster around these future flowers
are largely negated by the strikingly odd choice of an object for
them to adorn. A radiator remains, however, just the thing that the
author of <I>Tender Buttons</I> might be expected to try to carry
away from this place. But it is not June of 1914, not the summer
when <I>Tender Buttons</I> made its fairly muted debut on the stage
of the avant-garde. This short excursion in <I>Life</I>, undertaken
in a profoundly different time, before millions rather than hundreds
of readers, depends for its success on Stein managing to retain her
identity as a famously incomprehensible artist, while also giving
a convincing performance as an unremarkable, middle-class American
tourist. The critical, satirical edge to the piece--evident in the poses
Stein assumes before the Germans and the GIs alike--derives primarily
from the odd fact that these two identities exist together in this one
radical, ordinary woman.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
     Near the end of her essay, when she and Alice Toklas are flying
     back to France with the GIs, Stein comments wryly on her plane's
     new cargo:
     <B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

the boys showed us all the things they had acquired. Where they had
acquired, what they had acquired, better not know. There are three
million American soldiers there and each one of them has to have at
least six souvenirs. Dear me. They call these objects liberated. This
is a liberated camera. Liberated they are. [<I>Life</I>, 58]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As is the case in all her writings about American soldiers, Stein is
entranced by the GI's English usage, the way her native language is
changing under the pressures of war. For the victors, "liberated" is
a humorously dishonest word, a euphemism, an adjective that evades an
ugly truth about the spoils of victory. It is a word that exemplifies
and characterizes Stein's lifelong project to shake words loose from
their referents, to pry words apart from things. Like "exciting and
peaceful" in <I>Paris France</I>, or dozens of other words and moments
in this body of her writing, "liberated" belongs in Stein's lexicon of
words that reference wartime while also refusing to be only about the
war. Helen Button might cry at the end of this piece too, in spite of its
cheeriness, since it gives us so little to hold on to. It liberates its
readers, finally, from a world that is too strange, too filled with the
evidence of past trauma but without the cause and effect, the inquiry
into motivation that might make that trauma fit into an explanatory
narrative. We see Stein in the photograph from Berchtesgaden liberating
a sign associated with Hitler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Whether this liberation is successful we will have to determine
  for ourselves. While the meanings of that sign may ultimately be as
  resistant to moving as Hitler's radiators, Stein is conducting an
  experiment, in the image and the prose she attaches to that image,
  to determine how far a public moment and an historical gesture can be
  dislocated. Gallagher, writing about this photograph in particular,
  and about Stein's post-liberation point of view, finds that "the image
  is a visual representation of the 'liberation' of Gertrude Stein from
  a set of wartime political loyalties and representations riven by
  contradictions, doubts, ambivalences, and from the continual deferral
  of political interpretation of visual and other evidence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  But for Stein, victory does not bring unambiguous clarity, reassertions
  of meaning, an end to confusions and problems of reference. It brings
  only the unsettling facts of liberation.

"Off We All Went to See Germany" appeared in <I>Life</I> on 6 August 1945,
the day that the United States dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima. This
coincidence serves as well as any single event might to characterize
the state of the world that receives Stein's work. Photographs of the

  It is difficult to find a newspaper or magazine published in the United
  States in the years immediately following the end of the Second World
  War that does not run a series of essays on the meanings of having
  entered what is already being called the "atomic age." Stein dies
  on 27 July 1946, but shortly before her death she, too, privately
  joins this conversation about the Bomb, with a three-paragraph essay,
  "Reflection on the Atomic Bomb," published in December of 1947 in the
  <I>Yale Poetry Review.</I>

Romanticism and its sociopolitical agent, war, find their apotheosis
and their conclusion in this new invention--so completely destructive
that it lacks meaning. With her phrase "what is the use," she signals
the collapse of the poles of her art: poetry and history, pure and
instrumental language, private and public worlds. One cannot measure
difference or weigh winner and loser when there is "nothing left." Who
can discern dichotomies in this obliteration? Who will there be to
recognize this next form of the modern composition, she wonders: "Sure
it will destroy and kill a lot, but it's the living that are interesting
not the way of killing them, because if there were not a lot left living
how could there be any interest in destruction." There are, of course,
two enormous "lots" of "living" who would have taken issue with Stein's
assessment, however philosophically apt we might find it from our own
temporal distance: the wounded, dying, and defeated Japanese and the
enormously relieved Americans who had been granted a reprieve from the
nightmares of island invasions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Stein herself realizes that, in the wake of this second world war,
she has very little to say. It is essentially a problem of scale, of
calibrating words and things. If the Great War, with its ten million
dead, brought us into modernity, what do the fifty million dead in
its sequel bring? Why should she continue her demanding, risky search
for an appropriate register in which to write about this new form of
modernity? The history of her own art ends not with Hitler after all,
but with Harry Truman and the invention he authorizes for use. Her last
reflection on writing is almost as simple as saying nothing. Here is
the whole of her final paragraph:

Three weeks before his own death in 1939, W. B. Yeats wrote to Lady

  Stein was probably not aware that she had cancer when she wrote her
  final sentence, and had she lived she would no doubt have found a way
  to continue using language. And yet this paragraph stands as an end of
  writing, not a beginning. Like the patient farmers in Paris France,
  like Yeats in his final days, Stein imagines living in a way that
  renders words as incidental as the weather. There are no winners and
  no losers. Only the simplest forms of narrative, the least ambitious
  kinds of naming (if the fraught activity of naming is even necessary
  at all), and the last liberation offered by nature.

Wanda Van Dusen's essay, "Portrait of a National Fetish: Gertrude Stein's

in <I>A Stein Reader</I>, ed. Ulla E. Dydo (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern

find this argument convincing because in her various public utterances
Stein does not seem much concerned with a "generation gap" (witness her
<I>Lectures in America</I>--a great many of them given to University
audiences--which do not show concerns about such a "gap"; think too
about her various prolonged exchanges in both World Wars with soldiers,
with whom she clearly felt unusually comfortable.) Speaking to the young
does not seem to have posed particular problems for Stein. Nor is Dydo
entirely clear as to how bringing up the subject of war will make Stein
fit more easily with her audience (Dydo makes a passing reference to a
"post World War I audience, including some veterans"). Surely, insofar
as the war <I>was</I> on the minds of Stein's young listeners (veterans
would not have been students in 1926), nothing in contemporary English
intellectual culture would have suggested the waste and horrors of World
War I as a likely re for cultural progress. The ironies of invoking an
English "victory" to Oxbridge undergraduates would have been overwhelming
by the mid-1920s. It does Stein a disservice to assume, as Dydo does,
that she would not recognize these ironies, building this portion of her
essay around the analogy: "As one who has won the battle for the new,
she speaks to those who have won on the battlefield." (ibid.).

Reading the newspaper accounts of her tour quickly demonstrates how

Her wartime writing is read in France and England as well, but it is most

in periodicals, those periodicals are American. The important exception
to this generalization is <I>Paris France</I> which, in its conclusion,
calls explicitly upon England to intervene in the plight of Europe
(recall that this book was first published in England). It is important
to note, too, that this writing is comparatively widely circulated and
read. Stein makes money writing for <I>The Atlantic</I> or <I>Life</I>

French themselves as taking comfort from language itself: "The French do
love to say a thing and say it completely. That is the reason that once a
thing is completely named it does no longer worry them. Now the word une

and often to hold a more resigned attitude toward their occupiers than
the postwar mythologies would have us believe. I have benefited from

Stein and Alice Toklas, after a frantic 36 hours in Paris in 1939, where

Stein wrote this "Helen Button" section of <I>Paris France</I> some

This scene is particularly terrifying in the context of Stein's work,
since through the mid- and late-1930s she has used the phrase from the

does not know a supposedly familiar dog who seems, also, not to know her.

What follows is a position paper, although it contains a number of
modernist specimen cases upon which, as if they were park benches, it
comes momentarily to rest. In the early pages of Ludwig Wittgenstein's
<I>Philosophical Investigations,</I> itself a modernist test case of
sorts, Wittgenstein proposes a language game consisting of a single
word--"slab"--shouted out as bricklayers build a foundation and a house
of language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Think of this essay as akin to the slab game, a somewhat deliberately
 crude attempt to set up a way of talking about the larger foundation
 of our enterprise as critics of modernism and modernity, instead of
 an elegant perambulation within modernist textual spaces. Skirting
 the perimeter of modernism's walls, my polemic addresses the critical
 superstructure surrounding modernism's revival, probing its brickwork
 and sounding its slabs. These slabs, serving as the park benches I
 invoked above, are different in kind; one is a material conceit coming
 from the ground literally, while the second offers a critical concept
 taken from Ernst Bloch as a metonymic bench. Interspersed are leaves
 drawn from several modernist artifacts, while the entire essay rests
 on economic metaphors from speculative finance. Bubbles and slabs are
 antithetical, yet both can refer to critical discourse, in the first
 case as a speculative investment in value, in the second (slabs) as an
 antifoundationalist foundation for critical practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I'll trace out a conceit through much of the argument, borrowing
an analogy from another cultural arena also subject to speculative
bubbles. "I speak," to cite Miss Prism in <I>TheImportance of Being
Earnest,</I> "horticulturally." Consider the following remark, on its
face yet another frenzied, fin-de-si&eacute;cle denunciation 

<B></B>

of alterity: "It is impossible to deny that the blending of
foreign blood has seriously impaired the value of the pure strains. Many
of the continental sorts lack cleanliness and when they crop up amongst
their purer sisters their appearance at once betrays them." We imagine
we know the discourse of empire, with its binaries of contamination and
purity, self and other, so well we could gloss this in our sleep. Yet the
excoriation of sordid miscegenation with pure native stock emerges not
from imperial apologetics, nor from the popular press, but from a troubled
report put out by the beleaguered British tulip growers association,
circa 1900. The once majestic Royal National Tulip Society, representing
the aesthetic and taxonomic elite of the tulip industry, a society which
was down to two members when it tried to confer its varietal prizes in
1926, makes an eerie parallel to the fates and fortunes of the modernist
critical industry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  The Royal National Tulip Society--which waned altogether in 1936--had
  been the arbiter of excellence in all things tulip for centuries, at
  the forefront of aesthetic and horticultural innovation in the United
  Kingdom; and had an eclectic membership made up of hobbyists, botanists,
  aristocratic gardeners, and garden-variety tulip fanciers (<I>TT,</I>
  247). The creations of the Society, given the name "English Florist's
  tulips," sprang up as one-of-a-kind marvels in country estate gardens as
  well as in humble plots cultivated by the side of the railways. Again
  for centuries, English Florist's tulips were judged semiannually in
  well-attended meetings held by convention in public houses. There
  individual tulips, among them the feathered Bizarre, "George Hayward,"
  the soft, yellow "Mrs. Moon," the resplendent "Bronze King," and the
  Bybloemen tulip, "Princess Charlotte's Cenotaph," went head-to-head
  for prizes and approbation, their decapitated petaled tresses uniformly
  inserted into three-inch-tall brown beer bottles.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What had interfered with this long reign of horticultural glory, not
to say purity? In a sense mass culture was the villain, the same foe
slinking down the pike and gunning for modern(ist) literature and the
arts, at least in commonly-held versions of modernism. The first insidious
notion capable of shaking the foundation of the Royal National Tulip
Society's authority came, not surprisingly, from the United States,
that bastion of sleazy mass culture. In the early-nineteenth century
an American gardener had planted and raised tulips en masse as bedding
plants; the discovery failed to catch on commercially at that juncture,
but at the turn of the century Dutch tulip entrepreneurs--who had a long
history of making guilders off the backs of tulips--systematized and
mass-marketed the American tulip bed invention. The resulting bed or plot
of tulips became not only mass culture, but mass spectacle. The pivotal
World Exposition held in Paris in 1889, itself a design monument to
modernity, where the Eiffel Tower was erected as sheer public spectacle,
introduced the first world exhibition of massed tulips as spectacular eye
candy. The great Dutch <I>tulipiere,</I> E. H. Krelage, filled the beds
of the Trocadero Palace during the fair with what a current newspaper
editorial disparagingly called the "bang in the eye" of thousands of
planted tulips (<I>TT,</I> 223). Tulips en masse surrounded the base of
the iconic apex of modern urbanism, adding a horizontal, floral modernism
to the Eiffel Tower's vertical modernist spectacle.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mass cultural sea of tulips Krelage had planted was comprised
of no ordinary or anonymous tulip legions. As another first, these
were brand-name tulips, the "Darwin" brand to be exact. Krelage had
the creative and marketing genius to buy the rights to the name from
Charles Darwin's son, Francis (<I>TT,</I> 259). "Darwin" was an apt new
brand-name for a diverse collection of pink and purple tulip bulbs he had
bought at a vast tulip close out sale in Flanders, as that region ceased
growing tulips commercially (<I>TT,</I> 262). The individual botanical
and varietal names of the motley collection were excised; Darwin tulips
were collectivist, a brand instead of a taxonomic variety or florist's
name for a unique type. Once branded "Darwin," tulips became modern
commodities--not because they were being sold and traded on the market,
which they had been for centuries before--but because they now were
cultivated to be planted en masse, and given a brand name accordingly:
tulips became a modern, or even modernist, floral genre--tulips had
truly evolved.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Subsequent to Krelage's breakthrough on the tulip branding front, tulips
also entered modernity as a pivot of the modernizing tourist industry. In
order to replenish consumer wonderment at the spectacle of tulip fields in
bloom, thousands of bulbs were given away as municipal marks of esteem, as
awards for heroism, and even in exchange for arms at the outset of World
Wars I and II (<I>TT,</I> 268). Tulips shared another feature of modernism
in their internationalism and cosmopolitanism. An international floral
currency, the tulip began to be grown commercially in far-flung places,
such as Japan in the 1920s. The Japanese deplored tulips as unrefined and
vulgar, but overcame these aesthetic objections since they had the ideal
climatic conditions for their cultivation and export to less-refined,
tulip-hungry Western nations (<I>TT,</I> 268). Tulips acted as the thin
edge of the economic wedge in complex colonial situations, at times
valuable as a raw material for "extraction," at other moments important
as a symbolic show of imperial floral might. Hardball economic battles
waged by Britain over its possession and control of colonial tulip bulbs
echoed the violent, and ultimately successful, mid-nineteenth-century
struggles of the British empire to wipe out the indigenous Indian textile
industry. British women's clothing transmuted the often bloody suppression
of Indian weaving into flower-strewn calico cloth, its innocuous floral
prints masking a secret history; so too did brand-name tulips flower on
the foreign, colonial soil whose native tulip bulbs had been confiscated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps not surprisingly, it was a celebrated Irish gardener,
William Robinson, who proposed an anticolonialist twist in modern tulip
display. In <I>The Wild Garden,</I> Robinson argues that tulips should be
set out in masses, but not in delineated beds (<I>TT,</I> 259). Instead
they should be planted in nooks, on hillsides, or across a lawn, where
they will appear to have sprung up randomly in the wild. Robinson
articulates an anti-Plantation explosion of tulips beyond the pale of
the garden plot, and transforms the most cultivated, artificial, and
man-made flower in European history into a simulacrum of wildness. Only
the modern fashion for a Gustave Le Bon-like crowd of tulips--that is,
the brand-name cultivars Krelage and others had taught the masses to see
and revel in en masse--makes it possible for a subversive gardener to
achieve its antithesis, the aesthetic effect of rogue tulips springing
up wildly yet beautifully over a "natural"

<B></B>

landscape. Robinson poeticized the crowd of tulips by embracing their
previously suppressed wild side, in an act of colonial (Irish) mimicry
of the English Florist's tulip so strategic, his tulips could be called
Bhabha hybrids <I>avant la lettre</I>. By dint of a speculative bubble
afloat on the material froth of history, making a nearly circumferential
global orbit, and scattered by economic, aesthetic, and political
revolutions alike, the tulip had traced its way back to a <I>faux
sauvage</I> fashion identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist tulips also parallel modernism by providing a material canvas
for extensive aesthetic experimentation--or enough of a parallel to
keep this conceit in play. The departure from Kantian formalism in
the aesthetic evaluation of tulips was decisive by the end of the
nineteenth century. Heretofore, the criteria for excellence in tulips
were largely formalist. Dr. W. G. Hardy had written the seminal treatise,
"On Perfection of Form in the Tulip," in 1847, wherein he took up the
gardening cudgels against those who disagreed that the half-sphere was
the perfect form of the tulip blossom (<I>TT,</I> 232-7). Complex
mathematical equations subtended the raging arguments regarding the beauty
of tulips--whether their beauty inhered most in the straight-on frontal
view, or when seen from above looking down into the cup of the tulip,
required alternative calculations of sublime mathematical precision;
petal depth in relation to diameter offered a Platonic calculus of tulip
Form. Modernist tulip genres abandoned all such aesthetic numerology
and the formalism beneath it. The great English gardener Gertrude Jekyll
began suggesting, as of 1899, that avant-garde gardens contain beds of
multiple tulips chosen so that their colors modulated in finely-tuned
colorscapes--for example, "the blackish-purple Faust tulip" shifting to
a lighter and redder variety, bronzes shading into purple-tipped copper,
and flame reds coexisting with crimson in a fauvist riot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  With such a colorist's eye, mass tulips could still be differentiated
  as spectacle; Jekyll's Saussurean <I>langue</I> of tulips insisted that
  their value was always diacritical, a matter of their relation to the
  other tulips in the bed. Jekyll and other modern greats of the English
  garden established a modernist garden practice, eschewing essentialism
  and "the old stable ego of [tulipine] characters" in favor of fluid,
  nonlinear, and self-reflexive gardening techniques.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Gardens were to be shaped with verbal and visual allusiveness: Jekyll's
  tulips entered into a modernist compact in which their most prized
  attributes, their individual characteristics, were set afloat in a
  collage-iste sea of quotation, reference, and countermemory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, the beauty of modern tulips was also a social
construction, contingent on the material context of their viewing. The
gleaming radiance of the 30,000 Silver Hawk white tulips displayed in
the Sheffield Botanical Garden dazzled spectators thanks to the coal
mining strike then in progress; their unbesmirched whiteness was the
direct result of lowered smoke in the city's atmosphere, and depending
on the political point of view, veritably radiated governmental perfidy
or the strength of the labor cause (<I>TT,</I> 271).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The swerve toward massification in outdoor displays of tulips was
accompanied by its opposite: the very modernist vogue for tulips displayed
indoors as cut flowers, destined for vases and bouquets. Oscar Wilde
was among the first writers to bring the cut tulip into his textual
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne; in <I>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</I> tulips in the drawing 

<B></B>

room hang their heads over the rim of blue and white porcelain
vases from Japan, the visual trope of decadent modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The tulip had rarely been contemplated before in its decapitated state,
  sundered from its invisible bulb, until its bizarreries suddenly made
  the indoor tulip visible, and au courant. It is almost frightening
  on this score to search out floral references in Virginia Woolf's

  Almost every page is rampant with blooms. To inventory them with an eye
  to tulips requires sharp critical pruning. In film theory a distinction
  is made when discussing the sound of a film between diegetic sound and
  the film's score or sound track. Diegetic sound refers to sound or music
  emanating from something in the scene, such as a song being played on a
  car radio, while the score or sound track comes from "outside" the scene
  or narrative, superimposed upon the visual images. Woolf's writing is
  rife with "diegetic" flowers--characters fill vases, sniff bouquets,
  peer into garden blossoms, purchase flowers, and sell them--yet
  flowers, petals, blossoms, gardens are the green fuse that drives
  her language: sinuous vines and proliferating blossoms are Woolf's
  primary metonymies. <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I> hypostatizes flowers, and
  almost obsessively specifies them. Among those mentioned diegetically
  or as glimmering metonyms are roses of all colors and kinds, including
  hallucinated red roses on Septimus's wallpaper, dahlias, sweet pea,
  violets, hollyhocks, lilies, syringa, blue hydrangeas, orchids, pampas
  grass, purple heather, moss, carnations, lilacs, delphiniums, iris--and
  one and only one mention of tulips, as follows: "It was her nature to
  enjoy. . . . She enjoyed practically everything. If you walked with her
  in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator,
  now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  So Peter Walsh muses about Clarissa's character. The sight of the
  tulip bed triggers her enjoyment, but provides an occasion for her
  to illuminate the world for someone else. The tulip bed she gestures
  towards is a shared visual spectacle that the massified modern tulip
  synecdochizes perfectly. Even these almost throwaway lines about the
  tulip bed are significant in a novel so bombarded with the language
  of flowers, if one pauses for a bit of textual spadework around the
  flower's edge. One common critical notion about spectacle follows Guy
  Debord's determinist analysis in <I>The Society of the Spectacle</I>:
  that is, spectators are in thrall to spectacle, and their thralldom
  is commodified as an act of consumption.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  But <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I> as a whole will have none of this fixed
  economy of the spectacle, which Clarissa and others cut against
  repeatedly. Clarissa's expressed delight over the sight of the tulips
  nudges Peter Walsh into a moment's shared reverie. The modernist
  tulip bed is a commodified spectacle that dissolves and deliquesces
  with the nudge of an elbow. Like the coin Clarissa throws into the
  Serpentine in an act of expenditure, so too do tulips work their tiny
  magic as a feature of her gift economy. Clarissa is too old-fashioned
  perhaps to have cut tulips in her home, but she tiptoes through the
  modernist tulips to dapple the sight of them with the wonder of her
  enthusiasm. Rather than providing an occasion of "shock," which the
  novel so amply limns as a corollary modern experience, the tulip bed
  spectacle provides a distraction, in Walter Benjamin's terms, one that
  in <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>'s gift economy is only a proper distraction
  when disproportionately shared.

Seventeenth-century Tulipomania and the South Sea Bubble affair of the
eighteenth century are retrospective instances of speculative frenzy
reaching the level of the sublime, or at least the sublimely hysterical;
the modernist tulip market I speak of doesn't have the gossamer sublimity
of those bubbles, but instead the gritty, embedded materiality of the
smutty foam that delineates a port's edge. Tulips no longer waxed and
waned in value overnight, nor were single bulbs hoarded as species
of gold. Financial speculation is an iridescent bubble in much modern
socioeconomic theory, whereby the airy liquidity of intangible speculative
value is privileged for its very vulnerability to the surface tensions
that cause it to pop--yet one more demonstration of the mysteries of
commodity form, and the contradictions of capitalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Modernism as a cultural icon, or bubble, or iconic bubble, to
  oxymoronize, does not resemble the feeding frenzy of past Bubbles or
  manias, when capitalism was in doubt as a world system, nor does it bob
  up and down in the waters of a singular "market." Bursting modernism's
  bubble becomes necessary, all the more so when our own frantic critical
  splashing tries to make one large bubble come to the surface, even if
  it be a cluster of bubbles with the adjective "new" on its label. That
  is to say, we as critics and scholars of modernism have to recognize
  our own resemblance to the Royal National Tulip Society, insofar as we
  also attempt to keep hold of modernism and retain the right to award
  retroactive prizes to sportive modernist hybrids. The Royal National
  Tulip Society clung to its role as arbiter of tulip excellence, as
  it disavowed massified tulips, brand-name tulips, national and global
  tulip economies, modern spectacle, and the commercialization of tulip
  tourism. The parallel disavowals we make in our self-professed roles
  as arbiters of the new modernisms include purging modernist orthodoxy
  of formalism, tradition, hierarchies, social Darwinism, commercialism,
  bourgeois modernism, neo-imperialism, and totalization of all kinds,
  without seeing how much we rely on the modernist brand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism is a brand name. Coming from me, I should stress, that's
a compliment. Brand names have all the complexity of the Hegelian
hieroglyph, and they offer cultural space for the hierophantic, the
necrophantic, and ideological ghosts of all kinds. A brand name is not
prima facie a shill, a facade covering an empty sameness, a con game
designed to persuade gullible consumers that identical items differ
in kind due to their brand name. Brand names carve out a locus for
social recognition or attention, yet also defy linear logic or cause
and effect reasoning. Brand names are exquisitely sensitive diacritical
registers; they are more than the sum of their parts, if those parts
are taken to mean products, the ads for them, production, distribution,
and consumption. Brands can die as persons die, yet unlike the latter,
be raised from the dead in their own lifetime. Brands are aesthetic,
onto-politico-material agglomerates that live because, as with Tinkerbell,
we have applauded them into reanimation. Brand names also can live a
crepuscular existence, since twilight sleep or suspended animation is
often preferable to expending a brand's waning spirit in a waste of
shame--or killing it off. Modernism's brand name, as we know, lingered
for decades in such a boring twilight sleep, etherized upon a dissecting
table, or slumbering in a jar. Efforts such as the Modernist Studies
Association, the "New Modernisms" conferences, and even a provocative 

<B></B>

journal devoted to , share credit
for reawakening a slumbering critical and scholarly and aesthetic
spirit--modernism's brand. Each has something to do with resurrecting
and refurbishing a brand in advanced moribundity--at least in some parts
of the world. And as with so many commercial brands, the modernist
brand can only be resurrected by ironizing or implicitly denying its
original cultural status. This is glorious and salutary in some ways,
but should not be mistaken as gestures of pure cultural exhumation or
backdated exoneration. Brand names are revived so that they can still
be of use, can still move the goods. In marketing there is a name for
this: rebranding. A return to modernism with a difference, and with
a plural vengeance, as in "new modernisms," legitimately opens key
debates, stages productive re-readings, and enacts agonistic language
games of genuine import and ferocity. We cannot ignore, however, our own
investments in modernism's speculative bubble. As revivers of its brand,
a brand we cannot seem to do without, we re-brand ourselves as critics
and theorists just as we rebrand modernist others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because these comments can easily be misconstrued as a tired version of
the self-critical lament that "we're all complicit," or even worse in my
book, that any mode of criticism, interpretation, or theory inevitably
"appropriates" or "co-opts" something that doesn't belong to it, I'll
harp perhaps unnecessarily on what I don't mean to say, by way of the
now highly attenuated tulip analogy. Tulip growers of the late-nineteenth
and early-twentieth centuries were not "complicit" with a grubby market
in tulips worldwide, nor did they co-opt or appropriate authentic or
indigenous qualities of tulips by forcing bulbs, hybridizing them,
and finally creating tulip brands. The fierce competition between and
among tulip fanciers, tulip state apparatuses, and imperializing tulip
stratagems doesn't boil down to hegemonic violence, or not exclusively
so. Within a churning roil of bubbles, among them such contingent and
overdetermined elements as color intensity, royal patronage systems, the
rise of the natural history museum, botany hobby kits, the predilection
for British railway supervisors to dabble in passionate gardening,
nationalism, internationalism, cosmopolitanism, little Englandism, the
transformation of public space in the modern city, Dutch mercantilism,
tourism, feminism, diplomacy, imperial competition, the brutal
exigencies of colonialism and slave labor, beauty, the Eiffel Tower,
and ad infinitum, the agglomerate bubble of the modern tulip market
burbles to the surface.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As go tulips, so goes modernism. That is, its meaning is inseparable from
its uses and its overdeterminations. A relatively common stance amongst
those who would like to "make modernism new" leans away from the so-called
"high modernist canon," and tilts toward lesser known or even unknown
modernist artists to escape what appears to be the cul-de-sac of high
modernism. Exorcising the modernist canon posthumously, these critical
acts of purification disregard the modernist branding that, like Sherwin
Williams paint, covers everything, even criticism and critique. Those
nouveau modernist critics who wish to enlarge the modernist canon, so to
speak--and already the terms "modernist" and "canon" and "enlarge" beg
too many questions to address here--had better hope that the illusion of
a modernist or high modernist canon stays in place, to permit rebranding
along the edges of a very big tent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another and to me better frame for the reappraisal of modernism I pluck
from the resonant, splendid critical opus of Ernst Bloch, resurrecting
a term he himself had borrowed, in both cases of borrowing to infuse
it anew. In the essays collected together as <I>The Utopian Function of
Artand Literature,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Bloch cites "colportage," a real word that historically referred
  to the practice of travelling booksellers who crisscrossed Europe
  and elsewhere from the sixteenth to the early-twentieth centuries,
  selling novels, medical tracts, romances, scientific pamphlets,
  calendars, fairy tales, political documents, sermons, housewifery
  manuals, adventure tales, pornography, and prayer books at market
  fairs, from wagons, on the street, or house to house. Colporteurs,
  then--and the phrase unfortunately has nothing to do whatsoever with
  Cole Porter--in their meandering commercial travels gathered up,
  collected, and retailed the chaff and the wheat, the flotsam and the
  jetsam, the cream and the skim milk of published material of their
  moment. By means of colportage books and publications that belonged to
  completely different discourses, market niches, and even ontological
  levels were thrown together; in their array constituting more than
  the sum of their inventory. Cheek by jowl, their presence a matter
  of contingency as much as supply and demand, the colportage stocks
  taken as a whole offered, via commercial exchanges, an experience of
  "the <I>Novum,</I> the startlingly and unexpectedly new," (<I>UF,</I>
  xxxvii). The <I>Novum,</I> to follow through on Bloch's densely
  mystical yet materialist concept, is a concrete manifestation which
  orients people, even by way of monetary transactions, toward the wild
  horizon line of pre-illumination, or <I>Vorschein</I> (<I>UF,</I> 41,
  73-7). In Bloch's thought colportage becomes a philosophical,
  political, and aesthetic category simultaneously, and its place on
  the plane of analysis is similarly multiple--colportage is a process
  yet also a realization. Capable of referring to the plenum of genres
  and imaginative documents--including the ideologically dubious--set
  forth into the world by colportage, that is, colportage as both a verb
  and a noun, colportage is also a metacategory, a manner of regarding
  representation in its social, political, and aesthetic dimensions all at
  once. There is much that is reminiscent of Benjamin's notion of "profane
  illumination" in colportage, but Bloch applies no ideological litmus
  tests to the contents of colportage. The more Brechtian Benjamin of
  "The Work of Art in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction," for instance,
  evaluates the products of mass culture ideologically, and finds them
  wanting in all but future potential.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Colportage in a Blochian sense occupies or engenders a site of
  anticipatory meaning. This vestibule of pre-illumination is neither
  the endlessly displaced abyss or black hole of meaning, as more
  recent post-structuralist thought would have it, nor, although
  it is dialectically informed, is colportage a form of negative
  dialectics. Theodor Adorno's crystalline rejection of shabby and
  impure genres, tainted with commerce, whereby true art must exist
  as the dark side of the cultural moon, makes him virtually the
  anticolporteur<I>.</I>

I am inching toward an assertion that colportage, like the modernist
tulip market but less facetiously, is a remarkably helpful way to envision
the ductile "thing" we cart around from place to place, put on exhibit,
preach to and preach from, closing the doors upon certain display cases,
rearranging the merchandise within, colporteurs all. Modernism is as
baggy and capacious and eclectic as those motley wares of colportage,

<B></B>

gathered together because of historical contingency, circulated,
and sold. It is far more modernism's link to the <I>Vorschein,</I>
or anticipatory illumination, that makes the term apropos. Bloch would
probably have none of this conceit, as it runs the risk of including
"false illusion" or kitsch along with the colportage; as he wrote,
"the dream of colportage is: never again to be trapped by the routine
of daily life," (<I>UF,</I> 83). On the other hand, colportage gives me
a vivid conceptualization of and for modernism, especially as it is put
to use in cultural and academic circulation. Bloch's insistence on the
relevance of qualitative judgments within the precincts of colportage
and its often disdained genres, as in art generally, is an aspect of
his critical thought I am not willing to do without vis-&agrave;-vis
modernism. In many instances, the return to modernism as a site of study
and reconceptualization entails critical theories and assumptions where
value not only plays no role, but cannot be countenanced as anything other
than an invidious "distinction of taste," in Pierre Bourdieu's phrase.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  By other lights value smacks of a thinly veiled plot to reinstantiate
  hierarchy, elitism, or transhistorical, universal values. Bloch's
  thought, like Benjamin's and that of numerous others, points us to
  the fire escape exit from those egregious simplifications of "value"
  and aesthetics, the bonfire of the vanities. Bloch reorients criticism
  to values in time and of time. His privileged use of the word "now"
  (<I>Jetzt</I>) reveals the stakes of discriminating value as both
  "new" and "now":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The now [<I>Jetzt</I>] moves and propels itself through each day,
whenever. It knocks in all that happens, with its shortest time span,
and it knocks on the door. But not every present opens up for it. The
actual impulses, the socially driving pulses, do not knock in each
present fresh and vital. Not every time opens up for the now and the
next now that stands exactly at that moment in front of the door and
that has never "entered" before. It has not unloaded its true contents
with which and toward which it is on its way. [<I>UF</I>, 215]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Discriminations or judgments of value are being made all the time, and are
operative in every sphere, every genre, and at every level. Judgments of
value that spring from a colporteur's intellectual valise arise from a
mental economy of abundance, not scarcity, from a sense of the possible,
not measurement, and with an absolute lack of shame about expressions
of pleasure, emotion, and wonder. Bloch's colportage is predicated on
the unpredictable knock of the present on the door. More than that,
though, colportage contains a critical ethos of appreciation we can
best appreciate in textual performance. Colportage is thematized
and indeed enacted in Joyce's <I>Ulysses,</I> as in his other works,
with <I>Finnegans Wake</I> perhaps the most sustained spiritual act of
colportage ever attempted on behalf of a Europe plunging into war. Leaving
that to one side, one need only look at the encounters Joyce stages for
his characters within Dublin colportage circa 1904.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  Leopold Bloom is the very re to whom Bloch might be referring
  in saying, "the age-old pleasure of people, in no way simple and
  no way decadent, is preserved in the fair, wanders within it and
  without," (<I>UF,</I> 182). Bloom is surely a re for the modern
  consumer--as is the entire cast of <I>Ulysses</I> and its readers
  too--yet his immersion in the artificially protracted colportage of
  Dublin's colonially-depressed economy transforms him into a species
  of colporteur<I>.</I> He shores its fragments

<B></B>

not against his ruins, but as a zone of fierce intellectual inquiry,
passionate political imaginings, and intense, pleasure-laden evaluation of
the most utopian sort. Colportage is bricolage to the third power: no mere
act of magpie borrowing and collection, colportage is materially invested,
rife with judgments of value that hinge on hope and transformation. Above
all, colportage is a site of the <I>Novum.</I> "Make it new" is a familiar
formalist credo to be found on modernist colportage's collapsible
shelves. The <I>Novum</I> or newness lying immanent in colportage,
however, is transformational, affective, collective, and interactive
illumination. It emanates not only from the work or artifact made new,
but from the rich possibilities for newness, for <I>Vorschein,</I> to be
found in the pages of its disparate volumes, many of them old, tattered,
and shop-worn. Bloom strolls into the bookstall to find himself pricked
by this sense of newness; the <I>Novum</I> knocks on his door.

And in some odd way they are all "good ones." Modernism inevitably
contains its trash masterpieces, as it does its "classics." Bernard
Shaw made a similarly colportagist point when he insisted that people
require a steady diet of "trash" along with their masterpieces. The
colportage stall of modernism doesn't privilege a canon--for canons are,
after all, the illusory aftereffects of inclusion, not exclusion, where
canonicity produces more works, rather than fewer--but it certainly
makes distinctions, ever shifting, about which works it makes sense
to envision in relation to one another, which works give off sparks
of elective affinity, which works look different given what rests on
the shelf above or below them. The high/low distinction crumbles away,
and with it the need to tidy the wagon or purge the bookstall. This is a
modernism in and of the market, but clearly colportage as a historical
social practice involves buying and selling within a complex niche or
facet of "the" market, a niche sedimented with earlier practices such
as barter, coffeehouse information exchange, and clandestine or "black
market" elements built in. If possible, imagine modernism's brand name
as if it were a plaque or blazon or handpainted sign on a colportage
wagon, booth, or stall, a brand reprinted on all the contents of this
unclassified and unclassifiable collection.

The colportage modernism I am trying to articulate puts a premium on
both intention and reception--on value as an affective and a cognitive
judgment intertwined with pleasure, hope, and politics--and on the
diacritical relation between and among artifacts of modernism, in their
moment and ours. A few years back I could never have written the word
"intention" as anything but a critical epithet, and even now I invoke
it neither Hirschianly nor in Benn Michaels-ese, that is, in the voices
of two critics who made intentionality a platform of antitheoretical
textual analysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Intention in my critical playbook doesn't refer to a mythical inner
  intention on the part of an author to give a specific meaning to a work
  overall, or any of its parts, a meaning affixed there like authorial
  crazy-glue. Instead, I'm trying to offer intention as a dialectical
  relationship, a way of capturing conceptually the agency involved in
  tilting a work or an artifact or a critical text toward the social,
  political, aesthetic, affective, cognitive, and cultural context of
  its reception. For example, by this definition of intention Joyce
  <I>intends</I> that <I>Ulysses</I> offer an analogous version of the
  bookstall placed within its chapters, so that as readers hold the book
  in their hands they are inevitably repeating the distracted colportage
  encountered in the text, sometimes literalized as in Stephen and
  Dilly and Bloom's bookstall moments, sometimes traceable only in
  the colportage whiffs given off by <I>Ulysses</I>'s language. Its
  collection of styles, quotations, allusions, data, historical fact,
  and transgressions animate the <I>Novum.</I> Bloom's daily sojourns
  in the bookstall stage the possible, premonitory appearance of the
  new--a hope held out by the collision of his curiosity, yearning,
  and intense enthusiasm for change with an ideal constellation of books
  for sale that day, capable of allowing the present to knock upon the

<B></B>

door. Modernist writers such as Joyce don't intend a single meaning
or message, but do intend for their work to be received and consumed
in dialectical relation to surrounding works, discourses, events,
experiences, and so on--they intend the <I>slant</I> to the message,
if you will. Resistance or transgression--our critical <I>b&ecirc;te
blanches</I> these days--do not then lie in subtexts or hidden messages
under the surface, nor even in the self-unraveling of language languaging:
it's less a question of subverting a putatively hegemonic language,
than of exposing more of the material surface of the new in order for
the now to knock on the door. Modernism is colportage, then, but not
all modernists are colporteurs<I>,</I> not by a long shot.

The sounds of gunfire attend the final critical example I add to the
string of modernist allegories and conceits. Insurgent modernism is a
shelf of the modernist <I>colportagere,</I> to coin a word, an intent
within a work to push the <I>Novum</I> of awareness it entails to the
foreground. I've echoed John Reed's classic book, <I>Insurgent Mexico,</I>
in proposing yet another metonymy for modernism; the final re for
exploration of modernism's bubble then and now arises from a relatively
unknown modernist cinema, created along the U.S./Mexican border during
the Mexican revolution against Porfirio D&iacute;az and the U.S. military
who aided his regime.

  This cinema was produced in a meteoric arc by one Romaine Fielding,
  an actor and film director who as a star was associated with the Lubin
  Film Company, headed by Sigmund "Pop" Lubin, in Philadelphia. There
  was nothing obscure about either Lubin Films or Romaine Fielding in
  the silent picture era of 1910-5, prior to Hollywood dominance,
  when film companies roamed from Astoria, Queens to Philadelphia,
  to Arizona and the New Mexico territory and on to California; even
  D. W. Griffith's Biograph Film company made two films in a one-week
  stay in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1911.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Romaine Fielding, whose self-authored biography claimed an exotic
  Corsican birth and a link to Napoleon, was actually William Blandin
  of Riceville, Iowa. His huge popularity in the U.S., Europe, and
  Latin America and Mexico--for early film genuinely represented the
  international modernism of Raymond Williams's analysis--was demonstrated
  by his being chosen as the "world's most popular player" in the 1911
  <I>Motion PictureStory Magazine.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  He won by several million votes over such still-resonant names as
  Mary Pickford, Blanche Sweet, Pearl White, and Francis X. Bushman
  (<I>NMH,</I> 7). A consummate actor, Fielding was a tyro of writing and
  direction as well, and left the Lubin company temporarily to set up a
  film studio in Silver City, New Mexico. His intent was to make films in
  express sympathy with the Mexican revolution and its key res, Pancho
  Villa and Emiliano Zap&aacute;ta, as well as pro-labor films supporting
  unionization of mine workers, both involving the unprecedented use
  of mixed Mexican, Chicano, and Anglo-American casts (<I>NMH,</I>
  9). It now seems inconceivable that a film star and director of such
  widespread popularity in the U.S. and abroad could flaunt these
  pro-labor and antimilitarist stances in his insurgent modernist
  cinema, and moreover gain popularity as a result. Understanding the
  Fielding moment in modernism entails moving beyond a high/low split
  mentality, acknowledging intent on the part of its auteur, recognizing
  the popularity, pleasure, and spectacle inherent in this everyday
  modernism, whose achievement could not have occurred outside a branded,
  mass modernism without a shred of aesthetic autonomy.

titling one such dispatch, "Romaine Fielding: A Revolution of Human Energy
and Endurance" (<I>NMH,</I> 6). Among his oeuvre are films made in Santa
Rita, New Mexico at the Chino Copper Mine, exposing the grotesque labor
exploitation there, and inventing and celebrating a celluloid strike
which became real later in the year when the actual copper miners
followed cinematic suit. The audiences for these regionally-filmed
and highly insurrectionary pictures were by no means merely local, or
Southwestern--the films were circulated up and down the East Coast, and
played to transfixed audiences in Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Spain,
among other countries and colonies. Fielding titled one film centering
on the struggle of the Mexican peasantry <I>Los Insurrectos</I>; he
brought Mexican and Mexican-American actors and extras by the hundreds
to small-town or ghost-town sites for vividly recreated skirmishes
bursting with fire, explosions, and horses galore. The city fathers in
Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city, were so far from scandalized
over this affront to U.S. government policy vis-&agrave;-vis Mexico and
the labor unions--the cavalry and big capital were both called out--that
they begged Fielding to relocate his fledgling studio there. But this
radical municipal glory was not to be (<I>NMH,</I> 8). When Fielding
left the Lubin Company to found Cactus Film Company, his fame faded and
his company folded within a few years. On the whole, like W. C. Fields,
he'd rather have been in Philadelphia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fielding's work endures, as does the historical record of its
reception. His intention for these dazzlingly innovative movies--filming
"on location," inventing special demolition effects--was to show what
he called the "romance" of revolution and insurgency, to take the
"Cowboy and Indian picture" and make it newly political (<I>NMH,</I>
12). To reach this goal, Fielding relied on a realism more exacting than
his contemporaries were able to command: to enable his insurgent cinema
v&eacute;rit&eacute; he was lavished with abandoned homes to blow up,
sought after by eager extras and would-be desert starlets, gifted with
derelict mine shafts and weary horses by a starstruck citizenry. Some may
call this realism, not modernism, but I see it as modernist colportage,
that is, the melding of genres and styles--documentary, reportage,
romance, melodrama, westerns, adventure, political propaganda, etc.--to
arouse emotional and intellectual intensity, and above all pleasure and
wonder, in the spectacle of political transformation. Romaine Fielding
of Riceville, Iowa is a vanished colporteur in modernism's colportage
legacy. To recognize the existence of a vibrant and popular modernist
cinema with an ideological and aesthetic twist that doesn't fit the
dimensions of modernism's straitjacket is to recognize the limitations
of our grasp of modernism and its possibilities, in its own time and ours.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can rebrand modernism, or various modernisms, but we cannot recapture
the <I>Novum</I> of particular texts, whether visual or verbal or
auditory or choric, nor of politics, performances, movements, manifestos,
and events, in the absence of modernist appreciation. Appreciation
(read: valuing) has even less critical cachet and credibility than does
intention, and for good reason--any return to literary appreciation or impressionist 

<B></B>

criticism or, God help us, to belletrism, would be a
critical and theoretical disaster. But without passionate appreciation in
the market sense critics and scholars cannot make the necessary rebranding
of modernism anything more than an exercise. We have more than a little
in common collectively with the Royal National Tulip Society; we are
closer to the rheumy-eyed, onion-breathed bookstall colporteur<I>,</I>
muttering "that's a good one," than we may wish to admit; we stand in
lieu of Clarissa Dalloway directing others to "look" at modernist tulip
beds; like Romaine Fielding, even our demolition jobs must be done
with passionate intensity and spectacular flamboyance. Finding value
prompts appreciation--that sentence can be read in an economic way and
in a literary sense, yet is rarely taken as a speech act, an exhortation
to express enthusiasm. "Enthusiasm," William Blake enjoins us, "is the
all-in-all." Such enthusiastic appreciations of modernism can be (should
be) rigorous, historical, aesthetically incisive, and politically aware
all at once, yet without enthusiasm (even critique requires exuberance),
the critical acts that float modernism's speculative bubble in the
twenty-first century cannot permit us to experience modernism as a
"tiger's leap into the past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  That is Benjamin's famous definition of fashion, yet it combines
  with Bloch's colportage to suggest something about leaps of critical
  enthusiasm: the tiger's leap is the same thing as opening the door
  upon hearing the knock of the now. We know that modernism and its
  myriad works did not redeem the world in the ways we would wish, and
  the impulse to reach back into the past of modernism and imagine that
  a re-branding act of criticism can change that is understandable, yet
  deluded. Like an eccentric sect that must rather embarrassingly go on
  about its daily business after its leader has misjudged the End of Days,
  we have to recognize that things are as they are. This is tautological,
  and yet also extraordinary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did modernism, of so many tulip stripes and shades, then fail? Is
the critical act of floating modernism's bubble a doomed or tainted
enterprise? No, and no, yet not in thunder. Echoing Wittgenstein as this
essay also began, "the world is everything that is the case."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Modernism is and was the case in the world experiment, which in
  Bloch's critical humanism we are always embarked upon, the "world
  experiment" being the shared need to first recognize, and then change,
  the world. The modernist bubble of our speculations, set aloft by
  our appreciations as by our depreciations alike, enlarges the surface
  of what has been and might be the case, allowing modernism into our
  moment's world experiment, making modernism anew. In retailing modernism
  this way, we don't risk selling out--the only danger lies in failing
  to appreciate and give value, and thereby selling modernism short.

Contrary to the expectations that might be engendered by its title,
this essay does not concern itself in any way with unorthodox Marxist
theories of history and society; nor does it so much as advert, except
in this sentence, to any of the conflicts--1789, 1830, 1848--that made
up the so-called "Age of Revolutions" in late eighteenth and early
nineteenth-century Europe. No, the subject of the present article
conveys none of the drama and grand narrative sweep associated with
those ideas and events, though like them it has, in its way, organized
the experience of modernity. I am referring to the revolving door,
an unsung but pervasive--dare one say <I>pivotal</I>--technology for
modern living. It has been slighted by most historians of architecture,
by philosophers of the modern city, by historians of the department
store, and even, bafflingly, by Gretl Hoffmann's seemingly exhaustive
<I>Doors: Excellence in International Design</I>,not to mention Val
Clery's ruminative, phenomenological essay, <I>Doors</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Yet certain artists, writers, and filmmakers were quick to discern the
 symbolic suggestiveness residing in, and the cultural work performed
 by, the revolving door. In a dazzling essay on "The Use of Analogy in
 Legal and Political Argument," Elaine Scarry takes the emergency hand
 brake found in railway passenger compartments as a "materialized locus
 of consent," pointing out that, since the brake is accessible to any
 passenger at all times and

<B></B>

since pulling its lever actually causes the train to stop (it does
not send a signal to the engineer, but directly intervenes in the
vehicle's operation), it "has no equivalent within any other form of
transportation."
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 For me, the revolving door is just such an incomparable modern mechanism,
 similarly dependent upon individual participation and similarly replete
 with significance. Consisting typically of three or four glass panels
 inside a circular frame, the revolving door multiplies the possibilities
 of its "inherently ambiguous" plate glass by using it to reconre
 the space and experience of the threshold.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 We are inured to the revolutionary nature of this architectural miracle,
 inside of which material and location, glass and threshold--each
 in its way "a field on which the exchange between inner and outer
 occurs, a field reflecting the violation of space but also enclosing
 and protecting"--achieve a powerful interaction through a particular
 distribution of space and motion inside the revolving door.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 This "inside of which" calls for comment, for the revolving door is,
 of course, the only kind of door that is also a chamber, so that one
 can speak of being "inside the door." This renders it fundamentally
 different from the humble turnstile on which it is based.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The revolving door was the creation of one Theophilus Van Kannel
(of Philadelphia), who on 7 August, 1888, received U.S. Patent number
387,571 for what he called his "New Revolving Storm Door," and who the
following year was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Scott Legacy
medal for useful inventions. In recommending this award, the Institute's
Committee on Science and the Arts noted that "persons passing through
[the new door] pass as through an ordinary turnstile," but its members
recognized that, in boxing up the turnstile, Van Kannel had transformed it
utterly, turning it into something like a mechanical lung for controlling
the circulation of air and bodies alike. "At each one third turn of the
door," they noted, "a volume of air equal to the space between two arms
and from the floor to the roof of the door, is pumped out from the room
to which it is attached and a similar volume of air is pumped in."
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Van Kannel first began producing his new invention through the
 Storm-Proof Door Company of Philadelphia, and his earliest testimonials
 come from Philadelphia restaurants, dry goods stores, clothiers, as
 well as the city's Chamber of Commerce. Writing on 30 August, 1888,
 J. T. Harker, manager of Thackray's Restaurant, celebrated the door in
 terms that made plain its transcendence of the open turnstile:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the coldest days during the great blizzard, we felt no discomfort,
as it [the door] completely excludes the strongest wind, even while
persons are passing in or out. Aside of its effecting a great saving
of coal, it makes the front of the room as comfortable as other parts,
thus adding to the availability of seating room. I at no time found any
trouble in its use, a solid stream of persons passing in, and another out,
without collision, and with much more freedom than the old-style swinging
doors I had in use. The absence of all slamming, and the exclusion of
street noises, are also an important feature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Starting in the 1890s, the Van Kannel door began to appear across both
the architectural and the tropological landscapes of America.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 By the second decade of the twentieth century it had become a symbol,
 even a synecdoche, of modern American city life. When, in 1916, Man
 Ray resettled in Manhattan after a stint in small-town

<B></B>

New Jersey, he initiated the new urban, experimental phase in his career
with <I>Revolving Doors</I> (1916-1917), a series of abstract
collages hung on a hinged stand which spectators could turn as they
wished. A spinning door might well have seemed a fitting emblem for
modernity, since that condition was often described in terms of the
"dizzying" changes it wrought upon traditional social orders, and since
it was regularly evoked through images of rotation--Yeats's "gyres,"
Wyndham Lewis's "Vorticism," the chocolate grinder and orbiting
bachelors of Duchamp's <I>La Mari&eacute;e mise &agrave; nu par ses
c&eacute;libataires, m&ecirc;me</I>, and so forth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our habit of associating the revolving door exclusively with the
fast-paced, skyscrapered American city, however, may obscure a certain
ambivalence in its original conception and early promotion that can
usefully remind us of the door's Victorian provenance.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 It is true that Van Kannel himself sometimes addressed his public as an
 aggressive forward-thinker, disdainful of outmoded ways and means. In an
 early leaflet, the inventor somewhat irritably confronts the customary
 reaction to his door: "'Just like a turn-stile,' so say nine out of
 ten persons who first see it. As well may we say a tea-kettle is like a
 locomotive boiler." Much of the leaflet is characterized by just this
 sort of pugnacious modernism. "In the old way," Van Kannel recalls,
 "every person passing through [a door from the outside] first brings
 a chilling gust of wind with its snow, rain or dust, including the
 noise of the street; then comes the unwelcome 'bang!' This interesting
 programme is repeated in proportion to the number of callers. All these
 and many other annoyances are entirely obviated in the <I>New Revolving
 Storm Door</I>," since "[each] person passing through the door pushes
 any one of its four wings forward, the wing behind him arriving at the
 curved side wall before the wing in front leaves it."
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 As Reyner Banham points out in <I>The Architecture of the Well-Tempered
 Environment</I>, Van Kannel's brainchild, which was initially marketed
 under the slogan "Always Closed," constituted an important step on
 the way "toward full control" of atmospheric conditions inside of
 buildings--in other words, toward the creation of spaces finally
 independent of nature's rhythms and constraints.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet the inventor betrays a hint of Victorian double-voicedness
about this prospect, some portion of his sympathies hankering to
retain connection to, or dependency on, seasonal cycles. Van Kannel
envisioned that in normal use his door would have "solid or glazed wings
during the winter season and gauze or lattice wings during the summer"
("MEPA"). The very idea of fitting out a revolving door with gauze or
lattice must strike us--for whom the glass is a definitive feature,
part of the door's cold, antihumanist appeal--as an atavistic absurdity,
a misplaced piece of pastoral sentimentality. Still, one of the reasons
Van Kannel gave why the wings of his doors had to be able to fold back
and open a clear passageway was "to provide for the circulation of air in
the event of . . . a suddenly warm day in the spring or fall, after the
solid wings have been applied to the door" ("MEPA"). Like many another
bourgeois Victorian, Van Kannel seems torn between the allure of the
coming mechanical age and the currents of Romanticism still whispering
the possibility of a natural humanity. His early fantasy--shocking to
contemplate--that his invention might be installed not only in public
buildings <I>but in private homes as well</I> is of a piece with the
machine-age

<B></B>

domestic architecture parodied in Waugh's <I>Decline and Fall</I>
: even to think of imposing the revolving door upon the suburban
domicile seems an act of modernist totalitarianism worthy of Waugh's
Professor Silenus, who despises "all the thoughts and self-approval of
[the] biological by-product [humankind]" and who believes that "the only
perfect building must be the factory, because that is built to house
machines, not men."
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 The dream that the revolving door could be "an ideal entrance closure for
 residences" persisted in Van Kannel promotional materials for many years:
 a catalogue probably dating from the 1930s is still rather half-heartedly
 pushing the idea, even though no private residences are listed on the
 appended "Abridged List of Buildings Equipped with Revolving Doors."
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But Van Kannel's ardent-modernist side eventually acquiesced to the
 residual Victorian ideology of sacred domestic space. The Van Kannel
 door may have been "Always Closed," but, as its inventor eventually
 began to emphasize, it was "Always Open" as well, and the keepers of
 the American home declined to open their domestic sanctums to this
 "mechanical paradox."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another sign of the revolving door's late Victorian origins is to be
found in the nature of the claims put forward about it. It is not simply
that these claims are inflated, but that they are inflated in such a way
as to endow the effort to promote the installation of revolving doors
with a moral grandeur comparable to that of the great nineteenth-century
reformist projects, such as Chadwick's sanitation campaign. Under the
heading "<I>WILL IT PAY?</I>" Van Kannel's early leaflet declares that
the new door "will [not only] in a short time earn its cost in fuel
[for heating], but it will do what is of far greater importance. <I>It
will save life</I>, by preventing those deadly lung and throat diseases
which are sure to overtake the unfortunate salesman, cashier or clerk
whose duty keeps him near the <I>constantly opening front door</I>"
("MEPA," emphasis in original). The rhetoric of the early Victorian
better-ventilation crusades, with its "noxious effluvia" and "baleful
miasmas," is not far below the surface of such a passage. As Chadwick
had done for the rookery-denizens of 1840s London and Manchester, Van
Kannel will do for the turn of the century's new subclass of shop clerks,
whose members are on the front lines of commerce and cannot evade the
perilous influences of the streets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given such rhetorical affiliations, it is not wholly surprising to see a
latter-day advocate of the Van Kannel door place his discussion of its
merits in the framework of a Victorian-style comparative, evolutionist
and universalist anthropology. This is what Robert L. Blanchard does in
his remarkable <I>Around the World with Van Kannel</I> (2nd ed. 1930),
a text whose size and imaginative scope--it is nearly a hundred pages
long and contains dozens of photographs of Van Kannel doors on location
in several countries--make it something like the <I>Golden Bough</I>
of promotional literature. Blanchard's text is no mere catalogue
but a fanciful tour of the world, stopping off wherever significant
exhibits are to be found. "No matter where we go," Blanchard writes,
"over land or sea . . . we meet one familiar thing. An accouterment
that traces its birth to the earliest pages of history--the doorway,
or entrance." Warming to his theme, the author continues:

Doors have ever been a necessity to man. They have been in use, in
one form or another, since the early days when our ancestors lived in
caves. . . . Entrance has always been a problem for man to solve. So
important has been the matter that door is the one word that remains

Its product a prominent jewel in the crown of progress, its mission
to spread that product's benefits around the globe, the Van Kannel
Revolving Door Company as this sedulous scribe presents it stands in the
vanguard--or at the doorway--of civilization. If you do not adopt the
revolving door, Blanchard warns, "you place your health and your life,
or the health and life of your customers at the mercy of the elements
and in the hands of chance" (<I>AWVK</I>, 93). Van Kannel has answered
the desire of the ages for an airtight domain of human liberty--"Always
Closed"--where Chance and Nature cannot penetrate. A cartoon that opens
and closes the volume (<A HREF="8.4buzard_1.html"> 1</A>)
links the revolving door with the revolution of the earth itself,
both of them turning us from old worlds to new, from determination by
material forces to mastery over them, from beings "half-akin to brute"
to wholly free makers and products of culture.

And yet darker energies than these have also gathered on Van Kannel's
doorstep. Summing up the way Van Kannel's creation functions as an
"environmental filter" by "admitt[ing] persons but not the wind," Reyner
Banham writes that the revolving door "strangle[s] violent up-currents
at birth."
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The invention put an end to the phenomenon known as "stack effect,"
 to which tall buildings having banks of elevators placed in a certain
 relation to the entrances were especially prone: rising elevators sucked
 conventional exterior doors inward, making them difficult to open from
 outside, and descending elevators blew them out--the building seeming
 to respire like a slumbering giant. But it is the recourse to violent
 metaphors like Banham's that concerns me here, a habit that has perhaps
 been encouraged, by the historic portentousness of thresholds: it is
 through a doorway that we see the corpses of Agamemnon and Cassandra,
 over a gate that we read "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate"--or
 for that matter, "Arbeit macht Frei." Also contributing to this custom
 may be what Rem Koolhaas calls the "humanistic assumption" in Western
 architecture that there is a

"moral relationship" between the exterior and the interior of a building
and that "the 'honest' fa&ccedil;ade speaks about the activities it
conceals."
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Such an assumption makes the threshold a site for the practice of candor
 or cunning, plain-dealing or treachery and deceit; and it underwrites
 the tendency of Van Kannel advertising to envision the entrance to
 every public building as the stage for a morality play depicting the
 clash of Reason and Nature.

But there seem to be reasons beyond the traditional, more specific to Van
Kannel's invention, for thinking of the revolving door as a strangely
dangerous thing, a blend of beauty and menace that can take us places
we may not want to go. In the recent film <I>The Truman Show</I>, the
title character begins the painful process of unraveling his illusory
world when, instead of entering his office building one morning, he
spins the revolving door 360 degrees around and catches the actors and
stagehands of his televised existence off-guard. However comforting
it may be to contemplate the benefits conferred on humankind by Van
Kannel's sealing off of the threshold, there can be something unsettling
and disorienting about the experience of actually using the door--as if
the new invulnerability of the building has been purchased at the cost of
a new vulnerability for individuals. In Part VII of Hart Crane's <I>The
Bridge</I>, the poet conducts his readers through a subway station and
counsels them to "[a]void the glass doors gyring at your right, / Where
boxed alone a second, eyes take fright / --Quite unprepared rush naked
back to light. . . ."

 What is Crane afraid of? Francis Ford Coppola's <I>The Godfather</I>

 which one of Michael Corleone's henchmen, reversing that Enlightenment
 spin which Van Kannel liked to place on his invention, stages the

follows his mark toward the revolving door and flips the lock atop
the door's panels, shutting off Van Kannel's "stream of persons" and
turning the fluidly spinning wheel into a glass cage--ultimately into
a transparent coffin. The sequence gives us an exaggerated, gothic
explanation for Crane's dread of being "boxed alone," however briefly,
in this device that makes <I>visible</I> our vulnerability to assault.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we consult the useful annotations in the <I>American Law Reports</I>
(<I>ALR</I>) by Gregory G. Sarno and F. G. Madara on "Liability for
Injuries in Connection with Revolving Door on Nonresidential Premises"
and "Liability for Injury by Revolving Door," we must come away from
the experience powerfully impressed by the wealth and variety of mishaps
capable of occurring in and around this type of door.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Among the "contributing factors" to revolving door accidents which Sarno
 enumerates, one finds "location of door or nearby doormat or step,"
 "use of opaque panels," "size of revolving door's compartments,"
 "worn or defective friction strips or retarding devices," "collapsing
 of revolving door's wings," "improper use of directional signs or
 failure to provide warnings," "slippery or sticky substances on the
 floor in or near revolving door," and "other and unspecified causes"
 ("ALICRD," 138). The historical evolution of isolated incidents into
 a whole little class of legal proceedings can be charted by comparing
 the index to the 1st and 2nd <I>Decennial Digests of American Legal
 Cases</I> (covering 1685-1916), which contain only a subheading,
 "Door, revolving," and list two negligence cases, with the index to
 the 3rd and 4th <I>Decennial Digests</I> (1917-1936), in which
 "Revolving Door" has earned an entry of its own, under which to organize
 its ever-proliferating examples.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The decisions reached by American courts during the last decades of
the nineteenth century and the first few of the twentieth tended to
reinforce the idea inscribed in the revolving door's allotment of space,
namely that while inside the door you are on your own. In <I>Washington
Market Co. v. Clagett</I>, a 1901 case in which "the plaintiff [had]
slipped on a pile of fish immediately after emerging from a covered
revolving door leading into a market," the court held that while the
proprietor was obliged "to keep entrances [to his market] in a reasonably
safe condition," he was by no means "an insurer of the safety of the
persons who come there" ("ALIRD," 1346). In the 1905 matter of <I>Harris
v. Cowles</I>, the complaint charged the revolving door with being
"particularly enticing to children of tender years," adding that the
hotel in question had "fail[ed] to provide any apparatus to prevent the
limbs or body of a person from being caught between the door's jambs and
partition" ("ALICRD," 146). The ruling in favor of the defendant set a
precedent by rejecting the idea that the revolving door could be classed
with those special objects set aside as "attractive nuisances," for
which property owners must assume responsibility even where (underage)
trespassers are concerned. Traffic flow took precedence over other
considerations: it was, the court said, "manifestly impracticable"
to take the precaution of keeping the door locked, since "the purpose
of this circular door . . . requires that it shall be subject to the
uses of ordinary passage at any moment" (qtd. in "ALIRD," 1350). The
1937 case of <I>Provo v. Toledo Trust</I> reaffirmed this ruling: young
Albert Provo had, to his cost, evidently

<B></B>

drawn "the inference that the revolving door was to him a new toy with
which to play." But the judge emphatically denied that the revolving
door could be considered an "inherently dangerous instrumentality,"
finding that "if not defective, the possibility of danger inures in the
manner of its use."
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In these cases, the revolving door was playing its part in the evolution
of tort law. The accidents taking place in or around it became occasions
for testing the boundaries of those fuzzy categories of the "inherently
dangerous instrumentality" and the "attractive nuisance," which contained
the only recognized exceptions to the blanket indemnity then enjoyed by
manufacturers and to the somewhat less spacious but still significant
freedom from responsibility possessed by the proprietors of hotels,
stores, and the like. The notion of an "inherently dangerous" product
had originated in a New York case in 1852; afterward, as <I>Prosser on
Torts</I> informs us, "for more than half a century . . . there was much
pointless dispute . . . as to how such products as soap, chewing tobacco,
or the container of a beverage were to be classified."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Prosser characterizes nineteenth-century courts as animated by a general
 "social viewpoint" that made them reluctant to impose "too heavy a
 burden upon manufacturers and sellers" by holding "them responsible to
 hundreds of persons at a distance whose identity they could not even
 know . . . It was better to let the consumer suffer."
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Since direct agreement--or "privity"--had not taken place between makers
 and users, no contract was deemed to exist between them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin Cardozo's decision in <I>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</I>
in 1916 virtually created product liability law <I>ex nihilo</I>, by
identifying a defective product as an inherently dangerous one. In two
cases in the years that sandwich that decision, the Van Kannel Revolving
Door Company came as close as it ever would to the territory Cardozo was
opening up. Both were proceedings in which, as in most cases featuring
revolving doors, the complaints focused on "the rubber and felt strips
. . . attached from the top of each wing to the bottom along the outer
edge" ("ALIRD," 1350). In <I>Buzzell v. R.H. White Co.</I> of 1915,
the department store in question was exonerated of negligence when it
stipulated that, even though the strips were indeed worn down to such a
degree that they did nothing to restrict speed of revolution, they were
never intended to have such a function, but were simply seals to prevent
heat loss. In his patent application, in fact, Van Kannel never raises
the issue of velocity at all: for him, the strips "bearing against
the inner faces of [the] segmental side portions of the structure,"
derive their rationale entirely from their function as guards against
air leakage and, somewhat incidentally, caught fingers.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In <I>Hochschild v. Cecil</I>, a 1917 case about a sixty-eight year
 old woman who had "received a sudden blow from behind while proceeding
 cautiously through [a] store's revolving door," "a consulting engineer
 testified that the 'Van Kannel' door used by the store was what might
 be termed a 'pioneer,' but now 'obsolete,' type of revolving door which
 had been replaced by modern [versions] with stationary ceilings and more
 easily controlled momentum" ("ALICRD," 159-60). With the concept
 of manufacturer's liability in its infancy, however, the question of
 whether a revolving door can be considered defective, and hence an
 "inherently dangerous instrumentality," because it lacks any form of
 "spin control" remained a dead

<B></B>

letter. Beefed-up strips were quietly introduced; a feature of later
catalogues was the "Governing Device," which, it was asserted, "does
away with the <I>only</I> objection to the use of revolving doors,
i.e. spinning of the wings when a person goes through the vestibule in
a great hurry" ("GENIN," 28; emphasis in original). These alterations
were made not only to manage turn speed but to prevent backward, or
clockwise, movement--a phenomenon that was to have painful results in
more than a few instances, even though Van Kannel had said in his patent
application that his revolving door would "preferably [be] provided at
the top or bottom, or both, with a retaining pawl or equivalent device,
so that said door can move in but one direction."
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In <I>Finch v. Horn and Hardart Baking Co.</I>, a 1928 Pennsylvania case
 that bore out the principle of <I>respondebat superior</I>, the automat
 was held liable for the action of an "employee who was coming out of
 the restaurant's revolving door just as [the] plaintiff was entering,
 [and who] suddenly retraced his steps and went back into the room the
 way he had come, causing the door to revolve backwards and to knock
 the plaintiff onto the restaurant's floor" ("ALICRD," 148-99). No
 liability was attached to the manufacturer of a door capable of being
 misused in this way.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It would be misleading to suggest that people have shown a greater
propensity to harm themselves, or others, in revolving doors than
they have done in or with any number of other objects. But the
injuries sustained and the fear aroused by revolving doors has much
to do with the fact that they place two or more people in a form of
relationship not created by any other apparatus for the movement of
bodies through space. In the revolving door, strangers who are visible
to, yet partitioned off from each other are obliged to act not merely
courteously but collaboratively, choreographing their movements by
silent agreement so as to ease the passage of both to their opposite
destinations. What ought to occur is a model in miniature of the
well-functioning civil polity, a system of cooperative strangers and an
equilibrium of individual interests: the enterer's desire for ingress is
presumed to counterbalance the exiter's for egress, and the revolving
door is supposed to effect "the simultaneous passage of one stream
of persons <I>in</I> and another <I>out</I> with freedom and comfort"
("MEPA," emphasis in original). Furthermore, the revolving door gives
concrete shape to a vision of society in which the individual is, as
Rachel Bowlby puts it, "the only significant social category."
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Larger social units, such as the family, do not re in Van Kannel's
 calculus: this was a man who, when he thought of the future, thought
 first of the 21st-century "boarding house," an institution that exists
 to serve a population of unattached urban males.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In place of that absent <I>privity</I> between manufacturer and user,
 the revolving door substituted an unspoken pact among its isolated users
 to ensure the smooth operation of the mechanism and the safe passage of
 all parties. Anyone unlucky enough to step into the revolving door at
 the same instant that a homicidal maniac, a staggering drunk, or just
 a very incompetent <I>schlemiel</I>, was entering it from the other
 side was certainly to be pitied, but such a person would have no legal
 recourse against Van Kannel--even though dependency upon the other and
 inability to flee are built into the design.

Just as Cardozo was making legal history with his decision in
<I>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</I>, another visionary was developing
his account of a world centered on the revolving door and operating
on principles utterly different from those of Van Kannel's libertarian
utopia. Working in his scriptless, experimental manner, Charlie Chaplin
did not hit upon the notion of using a revolving door to provide the
engine of mayhem for his 1917 short film "The Cure" until take #77. Once
he had glimpsed the device's comic possibilities, however, Chaplin went
about constructing his film according to the method characteristic of
all his early comedies: "Every one of them," said an early reviewer,
"is built <I>around</I> something."
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 "The Cure" makes this principle plain for all to see, since Chaplin,
 flying in the face of premises liability case law, has decided to
 install his inspirational prop smack in the middle of a spa courtyard,
 perilously close to the pool of medicinal waters. He has also opted for
 that "pioneer" model of the revolving door that is capable of spinning
 rapidly in either direction. It is only a matter of time before he starts
 inflicting all manner of injury upon the prodigiously bandaged appendage
 of Eric Campbell and discharging pursuers headlong into that pool (<A
 HREF="8.4buzard_4.html"> 4</A>). Every hilariously bruising
 relationship Chaplin creates in and around the revolving door is derived
 from the repressed unconscious of Theophilus Van Kannel. Ultimately,
 the circular movement of the Van Kannel door becomes more than just
 the motive force of Chaplin's slapstick: it becomes a re for his
 comic genius, the signature or promise of an endless capacity for
 ludic invention.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lawyers filing suit against the proprietors of premises on which revolving
door accidents occurred frequently invoked the doctrine of <I>res ipsa
loquitur</I>, considering those proprietors responsible for keeping
all mechanisms on their properties in safe working order. <I>Promisel
v. Hotels Statler Corporation</I> of 1934 went in favor of the plaintiff
because the glass in one panel of the door had been temporarily replaced
with a wooden board, which blocked a woman's view of the man who was on
his way out as she prepared to step in: "the court declared that . . . the
opaque board created a danger in the use of the revolving door which made
it defective" ("ALICRD," 157). But proprietors were in the clear when no
such defect was discernible and the door "was operated and controlled by
an independent third party whose unusual method of operation . . . was
the proximate cause" of the injury ("ALIRD," 1349-50).
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Only in rare cases such as the 1938 affair of <I>Schubart v. Hotel
 Astor</I> did a court sustain a complaint against the proprietor of
 a premises that featured a revolving door in good working order. In
 this instance the court found that it would have been reasonable for
 the hotel to post attendants on the doors on the particular Saturday
 evening when an elderly woman was injured in them, because it was the
 evening after the big Army-Notre Dame football game, and a group of Army
 fans "in a gay, hilarious, and carousing mood" had taken "possession of
 [the] main lobby"--a fact that should have alerted hotel management "to
 the anticipation that the revolving door would not only be subjected to
 excessive use but also that it would be likely to receive rough usage
 and unseemly abuse" ("ALIRD," 1354). Poor Mrs. Schubart was the victim
 of "a couple of young fellows" who, in a carousing mood, entered one of
 the door's compartments all together and gave "a big or extra hard push"
 ("ALIRID," 1354). So much for that hopeful Van Kannel vision of sociality
 inscribed in the door's design.

But even when no accidents occurred and no bodies were bruised, bent,
or broken, there still remained a sense in which the revolving door might
be thought an instrument of a certain kind of violence. This door which,
Van Kannel said, "never needs closing, [yet] cannot be left open" was also
"a mechanical paradox," and by the time Blanchard wrote his treatise,
the company motto had been amended to "Always <I>Open</I>, Always Closed"
(<I>AWVK</I>, 94; emphasis added). For while it may be true that the
revolving door outdoes all other entrance mechanisms in safeguarding the
boundary between inside and out, there is another point of view from
which it opens up that boundary, giving movement across it a fluidity
no other door can match. "Persons on first hearing of the new door,"
Van Kannel wrote, "often fall into the error of underrating its capacity
for passage, supposing it will not permit as many persons to pass in
and out in a given time as the old style storm doors" ("MEPA"). But the
revolving door "keeps the in-going and out-going streams of passengers
separated, thus allowing one solid stream to pass in and another out
without collisions" ("MEPA"). Notwithstanding the inspired abuse to
which geniuses like Coppola or Chaplin have submitted it, the device in
its normal working groove converts human bodies into these "solid streams"

<B></B>

of traffic, then condenses those streams back into isolated particles,
each of which is encased, as if on display, behind plate glass for the
instant or two it takes the door to spin. Though in one way more fluid,
passage into and out of the building is also broken by this tiny hiatus,
which the user spends in a vacuum-like "<I>apart</I>-ment." The fact
that ambient noise is muffled during this brief delay tends to heighten
the impact of entrance into and exit from the door. The moment of exit
now comes as a release or, as in Crane's <I>The Bridge</I>, a rebirth,
after the user has been "boxed alone."

The revolving door's appearance of being a machine for breaking down and
reconstituting individuals "cut to size" is strongly suggested by King
Vidor's <I>The Crowd</I> , a film that bemoans the dehumanizing
effects of the modern city but also replicates them in the assembly-line
manner in which it furnishes its hero and heroine. The office workers
John and Mary are elevated to the status of protagonists only by virtue
of their utter typicality: give me any two of this teeming mass, Vidor
seems to say, and I will build my story around them. The couple is first
brought together for a blind date that commences at the close of business
hours. The sequence begins when John joins a line of men awaiting their
dates of the evening on the sidewalk across from the Van Kannel doors of
the building where Mary works. Spinning and releasing individual women
with the apparent randomness of a lottery canister, the revolving door
here marks the boundary between the new paper-pushing, service-economy
workday and a leisure-time, heterosexual economy whose processes hark
back to old-fashioned factory production. Each revolution of the office
building's door pumps out one unit of female product, straight onto the
arm of a waiting escort (<A HREF="8.4buzard_5.html"> 5</A>). This
curbside dispensary

<B></B>

of womankind manufactures straight couples with near-perfect efficiency,
producing but few "surplus goods." (Vidor briefly disrupts the workings
of this compulsory-heterosexuality machine by isolating a couple of women
who, "dateless," emerge from the revolving door, pay no attention to the
men waiting on the curb, and go off together. Only by producing a Mary
out of the revolving door, to go with his John, can Vidor proceed to the
task of producing his own narrative, which now begins to spin as briskly,
from date to marriage to consequences, as a Van Kannel "pioneer" when
pushed by a hurried user. Like the door--like the turning film reel on
which Vidor spins his story--the narrative of <I>The Crowd</I> describes a
circular motion, bringing its couple back around again to their starting
point. Chastened by the many sufferings he endures throughout the film,
John winds up happy to accept the job of street clown which he and Mary
had once laughingly, and literally, looked down upon, from the upper
deck of the bus that bore them away on their first date. In his end is
his beginning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Films like <I>The Crowd</I> secured the revolving door's identification
with the new American world of skyscrapers, commerce, and clerks. In
Europe, where "prior to World War II, the commercial high-rise was
unknown," Van Kannel's creation found its natural habitat not in the
American-style "cathedral of commerce"--the label given to Woolworth's
Gothic tower of 1913--but in the very different precincts of the Grand
Hotel.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 In F. W. Murnau's <I>The Last Laugh</I> (<I>Der Letzte Mann</I>, 1924)
 the circular door is, if geometry will permit the phrase, squarely at
 the center of the tale, first pathetic, then comic, of an aging doorman
 who finds himself abruptly demoted to washroom attendant and then,
 as if in recompense, suddenly made a millionaire to be waited upon by
 every employee of the institution that once degraded him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two settings divide Murnau's movie between them: the hotel where
the doorman labors and the working-class neighborhood in which he
lives. Conductor of human traffic into and out of the hotel, he is also
the film's humble Hermes, the only character who can take us from the
one environment to the other, traversing the whole social system whose
classes are otherwise so morally invisible to each other. The uniqueness
of his Dickensian capacity to connect the estranged segments of society
is signaled by the fact that he wears his doorman's uniform not only
on the job, where it is a badge of service, but all the way home as
well, where it is magically transformed into a mantle of authority: the
doorman strolls his neighborhood like a benevolent ruler, waving benignly,
comforting hurt children, deferred to by everyone. The <I>Dreht&uuml;r</I>
(revolving door) he presides over at work becomes the emblem of this
man who "makes the rounds" of a fragmented society.

Murnau's revolving door is, like Vidor's, part dehumanizing machine,
part re for the medium in which he works, part wheel of fortune. On
the day the hotel decides to replace him with a younger man, the
old employee walks to work as usual, enters the Van Kannel door,
and finds himself looking into the distorted mirror of his fate 
(<A HREF="8.4buzard_res.html">. 6-9</A>). The impersonal system
that dispenses with his services has unceremoniously ousted him in favor
of a new and improved cog, that erect and impassive re whom Murnau
places in motion on the opposite side of the revolving door exactly as
the older one enters it. In this brilliant piece of staging, the old
doorman's professional

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 575]</B>

talisman turns against him, and, pathetically, his first impulse is to try
to turn it back: having passed into the hotel interior as his replacement
has headed out to the curb, he now makes a feeble push backward against
the momentum of the door, as if he could undo his fate the same way one
might wind back a reel of film. His young usurper does not re at all
in the narrative: he is just the individual who happened to get the job,
and he just happens to pass by at that moment; but Murnau's dazzling
sequence suggests that Van Kannel's social ideal of a silent partnership
of strangers has been exchanged for the harsh vision of society as a
zero-sum game, all individual relationships corrupted into various forms
of unequal competition, all success gained at another's expense.

In Murnau, what is initially felt as the mere coincidence of two men's
movements turns into the violence done by an alienated social order to
its faceless functionaries. In the deliriously gratifying conclusion of
<I>The Last Laugh</I>, the dehumanizing mechanism spins the other way:
through the revolving door the former wage slave now emerges as a new
and pampered hotel guest. In a similar spirit, a memorable passage in
Kingsley Amis's <I>Lucky Jim</I>  uses the Van Kannel door to strike
a blow for all downtrodden and dependent workers, making it the tool
of the title character's anarchic retribution against his thoughtlessly
cruel, cruelly thoughtless superior, Professor Welch, for whom temporary
lecturers are as interchangeable as hotel doormen. The passage begins
as Jim Dixon leaves his oppressor at the entrance to the college library:

Dixon turned away, only to start violently and look back as a loud
thundering noise broke out behind him. Welch, his hair flapping, was
straining like a packed-down rugby forward to push the revolving door
in the wrong direction. Dixon stood and watched, allowing his mandrill
face full play. After a time Welch, somehow divining his error, began
pulling instead at the now-jammed door, changing his semblance to that
of anchor in a losing tug-o'-war team. With a sudden bursting click the
door yielded and Welch overbalanced backwards, hitting his head on the
panel behind him. Dixon went away, beginning to whistle his Welch tune
in a solemn, almost liturgical tempo. He felt that it was things like
this that kept him going.

In other instances of the Grand Hotel paradigm, the Van Kannel door may
stake no special claim to identification as a weapon of class struggle,
but functions as a more or less benign re for the changeful and
aleatory nature of life. This broadly "democratic" vision, with its
pacifying message that all are subject to the turns of fortune's wheel,
was perhaps an especially palatable one for American audiences of the
early Depression era, and it res most prominently in Edmund Goulding's
<I>Grand Hotel</I> , an MGM production that puts this distinctly
American spin on the Continental idea of the revolving door. The film,
which is set in 1920s Berlin, gains access to this generalized viewpoint
on life by focusing not on a single member of the subordinate class but
on an ensemble of characters, most of them guests, who pass through the
hotel and move into and out of various forms of relationship with each
other. In its extended final sequence, set in the hotel lobby, <I>Grand
Hotel</I> makes Van Kannel's invention the definitively human doorway,
the mortal portal, expressing with every revolution the mutability of
earthly existence.

In the thirties--when the second Waldorf is being built--the "Hotel"
becomes Hollywood's favorite subject. In a sense, it relieves the
scriptwriter of the obligation of inventing a plot. A Hotel
<I>is</I>
a plot--a cybernetic universe with its own laws generating random but
fortuitous collisions between human beings who would never have met
elsewhere. It offers a fertile cross section through the population, a
richly textured interface between social castes, a field for the comedy
of clashing manners and a neutral background of routine operations to
give every incident dramatic relief. With the Waldorf, the Hotel itself
becomes such a movie, featuring the guests as stars and the personnel as
a discreet coat-tailed chorus of extras. . . . The movie begins at the
revolving door [though it much more strikingly ends with it]--symbol of
the unlimited surprises of coincidence . . .

Here, in the Riviera Palace Hotel, the elite of the world pass through
Van Kannel doors. How many thousands have come through this door at the
beginning of a new day, buoyed up with the thought that today was the day
of success. How many have plodded wearily back in the late hours of the
night, after the casino had closed, sadder, but seldom wiser. Yet some
there are who swing through with light step. Winners for the day! And
wise old Van Kannel admits them all, giving each, winner and loser alike,
the faultless service for which [his door] is constructed. (

"Wise old Van Kannel" is rather darkly impersonated in <I>GrandHotel</I>
by the character of Doctor Otternschlag (Lewis Stone), the <I>genius
loci</I> of the circular lobby that is the primary space in this circular
film. A resident of the hotel, he keeps his station through all the
arrivals and departures charted in the movie, arrivals and departures
both literal and metaphoric (the film records one death, one birth). He
is given, for good measure, a face half blackened by wartime injury, so
as to identify him all the more plainly as Janus, the two-faced god of
doorways. His closing line in the movie repeats his opening one--"people
come, people go; nothing ever happens"--as the revolving door, spinning
almost continuously throughout the closing sequence, becomes his Ixion's
wheel. Doctor Otternschlag is Hollywood's Continental philosopher, its
minor Nietzsche for the inter-war years: deadened and detached before the
human comedy, he stands in stark contrast to the vigorous, newly-married
American couple that arrives and pushes its way through the revolving
door just after the many corrupt, disabled, or deluded Europeans have
passed out of it (<A HREF="8.4buzard_0.html">. 10</A>, <A HREF="8.4buzard_1.html">11</A>).

In the fifty-year span I have traced here, Theophilus Van Kannel's most
famous invention established itself not only as a definitive feature of
urban experience but also as a particularly rich and flexible trope. All
sorts of repetitive or alternating processes could be represented by means
of it. On it could be focused all manner of social hopes and fears; in
the glass panels of its quiet chambers subjectivity might glimpse itself
anew. I propose to halt on the threshold of subsequent developments,
which would

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 578]</B>

include the proliferation of the revolving door metaphor throughout
contemporary life, a development especially notable in the discourses
of government and public policy. Today an internet search of the phrase
"revolving door" will turn up a dreary catalogue of journalistic and
other reports on various suspect practices (as in the revolving door
between the domains of politics and corporate lobbying) or distressingly
recurring phenomena (as in the revolving door of jails, drug-treatment
centers, and the like). Since the conclusion of the Second World War,
the idea of being caught or trapped in the revolving door has come to
express the conviction of Red-scared, bureaucratized, conspiracy-theoried
publics that the modernist transparency of the revolving door is a
lie, that the forces propelling our movements and shaping our world
operate elsewhere, on some inaccessible, invisible plane. The sense of
fear and vulnerability that has long circulated around the revolving
door received its most notorious updating in the George Bush (senior)
campaign's race-baiting ad of 1988 attacking Michael Dukakis's prison
furlough program: that "stream of persons" Van Kannel had imagined was
now turned into a flood of dark-skinned felons making their way out of
lock-up and into our (white suburban) nightmares.

But I do not wish to end with this cynical soft-money spot, or with
Doctor Otternschlag at his private Gate of Hell, uttering those bitter
words akin to Dante's "Abandon every hope, all who enter here." It takes
some effort of will to think ourselves outside the postmodern cage,
back to an era when the revolving door could inspire feelings, not of
despair or of jadedness, but of wonder and joy. Before reentering as I

perfect use made of Van Kannel's device in one last artistic medium, half
a century ago. This was a form that, Chaplinesque, appeared capable,
for a time, of endless recyclings without loss of vigor, of eternal
returns to an enchanting Pandemonium whose victim just kept coming back
for more (<A HREF="8.4buzard_2.html"> 12</A>). The door spins;
Elmer Fudd stumbles in again; and the final word of "Rabbit of Seville"

By 1900, the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company, headquartered in the
Fuller Building at 23rd Street and Broadway in New York, was operating
internationally, with branch offices in Paris and Berlin, and holding
patents in many European countries. The spread of the Van Kannel door
in Europe was somewhat delayed, however, by various restrictions there
on building heights: the London Building Act of 1894, for instance,
set a limit of 30 meters, and without very tall structures (and banks of
elevators) the desirability of the Van Kannel door could not so readily
be perceived. See Lee Polisano, "Complexity and Contrast: American and

can probably describe at length the advantages and disadvantages of
different methods of using the revolving door when in the company of
small children. Do you put them in your compartment, and risk tripping
over them, because in this position you can better protect them against
sudden lurches caused by other users? Or do you let them go it alone--and
if so, in front of you or behind you?--subjecting them to the whims
of every errant door-shover, or worse, every lurking child-snatcher,
who might come along? If you let them face these dangers on their own,
it is somehow worse that you can see them but not reach them, so that
you might see the waiting pedophile who abducts them as they emerge and
then prevents your pursuit by jamming the door with some metal rod or
piece of wood.

Polisano, "Complexity and Contrast," 30. Its absence, Polisano argues,
may be traced to a fundamental difference between European and American
economic strategies: European nations opted to reduce domestic competition
by forming large syndicates or cartels that would "co-ordinate investment,
share capital and benefit from government support;" in the U.S.,
where a strong distrust of government prerogatives prevailed, mergers
of private companies gave rise to numerous very large ones controlling
sizeable pools of capital and requiring vast areas of office space in
the commercial centers. Kenneth Turney Gibbs links the emergence of the
skyscraper more specifically to the "meteoric rise of life insurance in
the business world" after the Civil War. The Equitable Life Assurance
Co. was "the first corporation bold enough to undertake a great office
building in connection with its own necessary place of business:" its
headquarters, constructed in 1868-1870, was also the first to have
a passenger elevator. See Gibbs, <I>Business Architectural Imagery in

Perhaps no question has proved as vexing as the troubled relationship
between modernism and popular culture. It is a commonplace to note
that modernist works of art were tireless in citing items drawn from
the popular, whether it was Picasso's inclusion of popular song titles
(e.g., <I>Ma jolie</I>), Joyce's complex reworkings of music hall in
<I>Ulysses</I>, or Weill's adaptations of contemporary jazz in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I>. This essay considers the context of T.S. Eliot's
1923 memorial essay for music-hall singer Marie Lloyd, the most celebrated
performer of English variety entertainment, and attempts to unpack the
specific meanings compressed in Eliot's invocation of the popular. His
use of that term cannot be properly interpreted, nor can relations
between English modernism and the popular be fully grasped, unless we
situate these phenomena within the larger context of the processes which
constitute authority in modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our standard readings of Eliot's essay miss the tensions that inform it.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This is partly because they rush to confirm some pre-conception of the
 popular, but chiefly because they neglect a considerable corpus of late
 Victorian and Edwardian discourse that addressed the English popular
 and shaped Eliot's understanding of it. The popular elaborated by Eliot
 in 1923 had specific historical ties to the culture of the Victorian
 professional-managerial classes. Late-Victorian literati addressed
 the popular via the events taking place on the stages of London's
 many music-halls, events which their discourse on the halls linked
 to a larger narrative about English national character and history.
 These representations of music-hall provide a background indispensable
 to understanding a notion of the popular which Eliot

<B></B>

knew and endeavored to further, even as he reconred it. Taken together
they formed a discourse which repeatedly lamented music hall's imminent
decline. Tracing its contours will enable us to specify more fully
that version of the popular which preoccupied Eliot and Anglo-American
modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Recent attempts to explore modernism and the popular have often relied
on two sources, Eliot's essay "Marie Lloyd" and T. J. Clark's gloss on it.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And rightly so. Clark's reading of Eliot rests on a profound grasp of the
 popular's historical derivation within the rise of commodity culture. In
 his remarkable book, <I>The Painting of Modern Life</I>, he pinpoints the
 origins of the popular in a class-based discourse. The modern popular
 has two prerequisites for its crystalization. First, there must be
 a prevalent working-class cultural form (the caf&eacute;-chantant in
 France, for example), one which is being developed into a full-scale,
 commercial leisure enterprise, appropriated and standardized by
 business-minded entrepreneurs and impresarios. The popular is built on
 working-class culture which is on the verge of becoming the commercial
 culture of urban and industrial capital.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, the making of the popular as a discursive realm also requires
the active presence of a bourgeois subject acting in a manner hitherto
mostly unacknowledged by later historical accounts. The popular, in
this view, receives its shape and definition from a curious, intrusive
fraction of the middle-class, one more interested in artistic production
or conspicuous consumption than investment, thrift, or moral convention.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 These middle-class cognoscenti patronized the popular and represented
 it in painting and aesthetic discourse, representations which neither
 elaborate nor instantiate the popular, but obfuscate it. The popular,
 in Clark's account, is a fiction forged to confiscate the new-found
 authority of working-class performers and their culture; it is an
 interpretation which contains the working-class character of the popular
 and conceals the core of class difference that remains in a social
 world privileging the spectacle of social mobility over its reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clark's insight, that the popular had a mid-Victorian genesis, and
was a discourse of incipient professional authority, of a new class of
salaried burghers intent on pursuing an aristocratic cultural hedonism,
is a precondition for understanding how Eliot responded to English
music-hall in the "London Letters" which he wrote for <I>The Dial</I>
and how he defined and dissected the popular in "Marie Lloyd." But does
Clark's reconstructed popular describe the same object which Eliot is
expounding? Partly. The growth of the London music-hall paralleled the
development and expansion of the Parisian caf&eacute;-chantant. And by
the late 1880s, with the growth of suburban variety-theater, London
music-hall was on the verge of losing its exclusive working-class
character and gaining a new, more upscale market demographic. Critics,
artists, marketers, promoters, and social scientists competed with
the belletristic observers of music-hall to represent it; they largely
believed--though some of them were also alarmed by it--that a new mass
culture entertainment had come to represent the national character and
attained a role in forging the national temper.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Many of these observers, whether literati or social scientists, belonged
 to the rank of the new professional classes, trained workers who saw
 their authority based on their education rather

<B></B>

than inheritance or financial holdings. They believed their observations
of the effects and significance of mass culture constituted work for
the public weal; it was their duty to sift whatever was good from the
otherwise degraded mass character of urban leisure forms. For some of
them, music-hall was valuable simply because it seemed to make visible
the specific nature of English identity, or because it was thought that
music-hall had achieved a national character in terms of its influence
and range. Here was a distinctively English art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot was clearly moved by the English popular, intrigued by that account
which cultured cognoscenti had fashioned to assess the broad significance
of London music-hall and its popularity. Ronald Schuchard deems Eliot
the last heir of aesthete musings on music-hall.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The writings of critic and poet Arthur Symons on music-hall; the wry,
 sophisticated, and contradictory appreciations of the entertainment
 by Max Beerbohm; the images of music-hall and its audiences by Walter
 Sickert; and the vision of music-hall as vital vulgarity distilled in
 the poetry of John Davidson--all these encouraged Eliot to seek content
 for poetry as well as subjects for his essays in the halls.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Schuchard amply shows how earlier writings on music-hall influenced
 Eliot as both a poet and cultural observer, and his observations
 broadly support Clark's account of an Eliot who was influenced by the
 very concept of the popular which he was simultaneously attempting
 to interpret.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That said, Clark seems to deny Eliot the kind of self-conscious
distance towards the fiction of the popular that later critics appear to
maintain. He quotes approvingly from Eliot's indictment of the English
bourgeois in the essay on "Marie Lloyd." "I have called [Lloyd] the
expressive re of the lower classes. There is no such expressive
re for any other class. The middle classes have no such idol: the
middle classes are morally corrupt."
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Yet on Clark's own terms, Eliot's polemic cannot be taken at face
 value. Likewise, the single minded notion of class which Eliot seemingly
 propounds cannot be taken as the measure of Eliot's insight. Surely
 Eliot could take up the kind of reflexive stance which was entailed
 in the conceptual understanding of class relations that the popular
 provided. The concept of the popular which is safeguarded in this
 passage boasts a complex history of usage, of which Eliot was well
 aware. Given that awareness, could he really continue to believe in a
 totalized bourgeois class? Or that music-hall was working-class culture
 made flesh and maintained in its essence? If the popular exists largely
 as discursive mode, it exists primarily as a social construct which has
 been assembled of varied parts. It is difficult to be fully convinced by
 Clark's image of a lumpen culture in its "original consistency," a pure
 signifier of working-class culture existing prior to and utterly divorced
 from the middle-class construct of the popular (<I>POML</I>, 230).
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such claims insinuate that performers like Marie Lloyd represent the
 popular solely on the basis of birth, a point that would not set well,
 one imagines, with either Clark or Eliot. Too many questions are finally
 left unanswered. Why does Eliot's essay so signally fail to define its
 lead concept, the popular? Why does Lloyd's death create what Eliot
 considers to be a shift in the delicate equilibrium of the social and
 moral order? Why does Eliot entertain the idea that it constitutes
 a tragic moment for the social order if music-hall is replaced by
 Hollywood cinema? After all, wouldn't the terms of the popular, as
 Clark understands them, have remained just as secure?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Eliot's essay on "Marie Lloyd," the end of vital music-hall is
made to signify something like that favored modernist trope of crisis,
the end of art. Mass culture, instead, denotes mass produced art which
is disseminated by means of "electrical ingenuity," or cinema and radio
broadcasts ("ML," 173), and it will lead to the wholesale destruction of
proletarian moral fiber because those media foster fundamentally passive
responses to art and destroy the "natural" tendency of the working-class
to collaborate in aesthetic production. Mass culture means credulous,
lazy, and corrupted spectators; the end of proletarian culture by
necessity imperils the nation, since the working-class represent, in
Eliot's words, "that part of the nation which has perhaps the greatest
vitality and interest"("ML," 172).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This sort of talk--the abstraction of a vital and guileless people,
the equally totalized notion of "technology" which mobilizes Eliot's
disdain--sums up much that exasperates us about modernist discourse. Yet,
"Marie Lloyd" is more than a programmatic modernist stand on "the
people": it also introduces a complex notion of mediation into its
rhetoric of the popular. Among music-hall performers, Eliot maintains,
Lloyd was "the strongest" due to her "hold on popular affection," a hold
attributed to "her understanding of the people and sympathy with them,
and the people's recognition of the fact that she embodied the virtues
which they genuinely most respected in private life"("ML," 173). Eliot
values Lloyd both for her labor and her essence, for both "represent[ing]
and express[ing]" the working-class, a statement that works over,
I will argue, a major tension between these terms as Eliot understood
them. Further, Lloyd's relationship to her audience is one in which she
stands as an idealized version of the poet and critic vis-&agrave;-vis
the community. "Representation," therefore, becomes a more complicated,
mediated, and self-reflexive process than Clark's reading of Eliot
or the popular would allow. If Marie Lloyd stands in for the critic
in this new social compact, it emphasizes the collaborative work of
representation and the corporate nature of the popular itself, which is
now seen to be forged from partial views and responses moving across class
boundaries. The bourgeois incapacity for self-representation, so damned in
Eliot's barbed comments, has left Lloyd as a proxy for the intellectual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's insistence that a working-class woman represents the popular is
important. He is always aware that Lloyd is both <I>representative</I>
and <I>his</I> representative, a status which runs against the grain of
prevailing aesthetic practice. For Eliot's contemporaries, aesthetic
codes were assumed to function on a single plane, within a clearly
marked terrain. Protocols of aesthetic value and judgment invite
cultural participants to learn from models of excellence that exist
either within one's horizon, or just above it--and for "horizon," one has
history's sanction to read "class." Tracing his appreciation for Lloyd,
Eliot anticipates a key condition of our contemporary affective lives,
insofar as modernity is actualized and achieved in the search for proxies
of the inner life over, under and across social hierarchies, rather than
on the horizontal plane of status.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's alarm at the prospect that music-hall will give way to cinema may
seem excessive. But his anxiety stems in part from his awareness that a
received conceptualization of the popular was no longer fully convincing
for an increasing number of intellectuals. In that conceptualization,
London music-hall was deemed a mass

<B></B>

cultural form which could be redeemed by discerning critics insofar
as they discerned its peculiar capacity to mirror Englishness. In
"Marie Lloyd," Eliot mourns not just a singer, but also the premature
end of just this discourse of professional authority, much as Clark's
argument suggests. However, what Clark has called "terrible fiction"
(<I>POML</I>, xxvi) of the English popular did not follow a single
formula, but a much looser logic in which the popular was made to dovetail
with the recognition--or the production--of persistent traits of national
character, versions of venerable and pedigreed Englishness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Marie Lloyd" presents two strands of the popular which maintain a
troubled co-existence. One is a sentimental strand of populism in
which class is abrogated in order to create novel aesthetic protocols
for a brave new class of culture managers and administrators. Yet, this
"modernist popular," to call it that, is kept under pressure by the weight
of an accumulated discourse which insisted, always with an elegiac note,
that music-hall had accommodated the very essence of the nation, that it
epitomized the national popular. Under the influence of this view, Eliot
adopted some of its grammar and syntax to contain the novel experience
of mass culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much of "Marie Lloyd" is taken up with Eliot's anxiety that the national
popular is being displaced by the new global popular, or put another way,
that a commodity form is crowding out a unique cultural heritage, one
which is in some sense timelessly English. In part the essay's apocalyptic
tenor reflects a critical mind exploring the limits of an inherited
concept of the popular, one which had commercial music-hall, without
obvious contradiction, appear to stand outside commodity culture in the
mind of the cultural &eacute;lite. In part it reflects a latent fear that
the class of culture pundits who had tutored the poet in the popular,
a class which was itself of relatively recent date, would no longer be
authorized to define which cultural forms were truly significant. The
new global popular, represented by radio and cinema, stood for genuine
and degraded mass culture in a way that the discursive music-hall,
worked over and transformed by these thinking &eacute;lites, did not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The inchoate quality of the memorial stems from Eliot's unconscious
struggle with a previous discoursive strain, leaving his new insights
tentative. "Marie Lloyd" bridges the shift from one version of the
popular, articulated by intellectuals in a mode which binds the popular
to the nation, to a trans-national mode of the popular. Modernism, or
at least that version of it which Eliot articulated, validated these
earlier observations on the popular which had been derived from the
English music-hall experience and built up by experts who had a stake in
articulating a national community. That new managerial or professional
class had relied on the authority that resided in national images to
anchor its own claims to expertise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The discursive tradition on which Eliot was drawing exhibited sufficient
form and thematic cohesion that it might well be called a genre--or at
least a sub-genre, one that we might name the "music-hall lament." The
lament's key traits are elaborated in several contemporary essays
on the music-hall. Music-hall, these generic essays argued, could be
best understood if situated within a specific story detailing English
national history and the presumed continuity of English character. The
lament assumes aspects of music-hall that its audiences might neglect;
it posits music-hall as a complexly significant

<B></B>

ritual, requiring lay-persons to lean on <I>aficionados</I> for
their guidance and tutelage through the interpretive maze. Many of
these late-Victorian and Edwardian essays were overtly pessimistic,
the halls were in danger of losing their authenticity, of succumbing
to decadence. The lament also served a pedagogical function for a
bourgeois readership; it encouraged them to see music-hall and mass
culture correctly, as intellectuals saw it; and it permitted critical
intellectuals to assume a tutelary role toward a public which was supposed
to follow the delicate discriminations of experts which were required
to maintain the production of the popular.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The genre first appears in 1893 with "The Pedigree of the Music-hall,"
an essay which art critic and scholar Elizabeth R. Pennell published in
the English journal <I>The Contemporary Review</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Pennell traces the rise of a communal art form that produced singers,
 comics, and entertainers who reflected the working-class audiences
 which came to the early halls. That form, Pennell warns, is already
 being threatened by the newer variety theaters which are suitable
 for family audiences. It is in danger of losing the common touch, the
 vulgarity that for discerning middle-class observers like Pennell has
 constituted its value and grounded its authentic character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To defend music-hall, Pennell adopts a paradoxical strategy: this
"modern institution" is given an almost timeless, natural origin.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 "If the music-hall be a modern institution, the entertainment it provides
 is the heirloom of centuries. There is not a turn which is new" ("PMH,"
 580). English theater may have originated in the miracle play, as so
 often asserted, but music hall was even older. "Before the Miracle Play
 had been invented, the people of England had clamoured for variety
 entertainment, and been given it. There was not a castle throughout
 the land that had not its own special London Pavilion or Alhambra
 in miniature" ("PMH," 575). The analogies escalate in a rhetorical
 pile-up: "And the other turns boast a pedigree as illustrious and as
 long. Acrobats and jugglers, bears and dogs, by the same feats and the
 same tricks--you can see them in illuminated MSS. And old wood-cuts
 held Saxon and Norman spell-bound, as they hold the Cockney today. Not
 one number of the programme could be cited which has not its medieval
 counterpart. More of the past lives in the music hall than in any other
 modern institution" ("PMH," 583). Music hall, in short, uniquely embodies
 the national character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pennell's sketch of music-hall history authenticates the form, yet closes
on an ominous note. "For centuries Englishmen have been shaping their
variety entertainment into its present form, and now, like a child with
the toy it has been crying for, they are doing their best to destroy it"
("PMH," 583). The sudden shift in tone, though momentarily jarring, forms
part of her larger project. Although her historical account of music hall
effectively compacts it into a uniform expression of national identity, it
is conspicuously directed to a public distinct from the people supposedly
represented by or even involved in music hall's production. In fact,
she complains about "proprietors and managers, working men patrons and
artistes," all of whom "protest that the variety show is a great moral
force, an educational factor, a safeguard against intemperance" ("PMH,"
583). This view defends music hall on the ground that it is compatible
with or faithful to middle-class standards. But the popular is something
which most middle-class

<B></B>

 citizens either neglected or disdained. It requires an
expert to savor, to study, and, finally, to preserve its popular
essence. "Evidently, its days are numbered," Pennell sighs. Yet all is
not lost: "When too late, when it is no longer studied at first hand,
the scholar will learn its value" ("PMH," 583). Here is the paradox of
a popular whose authoritative status is sanctioned not by the people,
but by those qualified and trained to recognize the workings of history
and culture. Pennell's account deftly introduces the tone of elegy
and links it to an argument for the need for critical experts on the
popular. The future of music-hall, and of culture writ large, is in the
hands of this managerial &eacute;lite, whom Pennell wishes to empower,
to preserve the form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pennell can be said to have originated the music-hall lament; dandy
and critic Max Beerbohm had the honor of codifying it. Beerbohm, having
replaced George Bernard Shaw as critic for the <I>Saturday Review</I>,
covered the turn-of-the-century London theater and music-hall scene. He
focussed on music-hall in a series of reflective and complexly deliberate
essays, which took up and further elaborated Pennell's homology between
the entertainment and national character.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The elegiac note was sounded more powerfully: music hall, he thought, was
 threatened by its commercial success. It had to be saved by connoisseurs
 who would provide professional guidance to a public they would both
 address and construct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of all the music-hall acolytes, Beerbohm best exemplifies the generous
inclusiveness, and the decided limits, which characterized late Victorian
concepts of the popular. His admiration of the form is expansive,
but also committed to maintaining the superior stance of the critical
observer. His ironic tone never conceals his deep affection; rather,
it results in double-voiced statements, elevated praise mixed with
waspish barbs. He is certain that the halls are stupid, vulgar--and,
for that very reason, perfect. His evaluative claims subtly calibrate
differences between trained and untrained observers, yet also keep
notions of aesthetic distinction and elevation intact. His ambiguous
commendations simultaneously exalt the halls and claim possession of a
specific version of music hall, one which requires a critical discernment
to be appreciated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These discrete claims tend to function to a single effect: the elevation
of discerning partisans over untrained onlookers. The ironic partisan
can best apprehend ties between music-hall performance and authentic
working-class character, ties lost on the mere spectator. In "The Older
and Better Music-hall" , Beerbohm muses on music hall's growing
commercial success and the appropriation of the "popular" and "vulgarity"
which it seemingly entails. Such success may well represent a crisis for
the form, but it is also an opportunity for the critic. For "a keen soul"
presented with an art in decline there are several choices. Either "the
soul lives in the future, the art lagging behind" or "the soul lives in
the past, left behind by the art."
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Beerbohm left no doubts about his own position. "In the matter of
 music-halls, I am already a staunch, even a passionate reactionary,"
 he states, announcing his "dislike [of] the fashion that now dominates
 not merely the specific palace of varieties but also such places as
 the Pavilion, the Tivoli, and even that titular home of lost causes
 and impossible loyalties, the Oxford" ("OBMH," 384)

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Older and Better Music-hall" ends with hope for the future, provided
readers heed the critic's call to action: "Can we recapture the olden
pleasure? Indeed yes. I have found a place. Let me guide you to it"
("OBMH," 383). What follows is a description of singer Harry Freeman,
whose performance style lacks the refinement of the newer palaces of
variety. "Let us go to it [the Metropolitan] often, magically renewing
there our youth. And in those dreary other halls let us nevermore set
foot" ("OBMH," 385). Beerbohm privileges the older, less assimilated
music-hall partly because he thinks it genuinely better, but partly
because it allows discerning observers to recognize and appreciate the
lineaments of national tradition in its unprocessed vulgarity. "This is
one of the advantages of the old music-hall over the new," he declares:
"it does reflect, in however grotesque a way, the characters of the class
to which it consciously appeals" ("OBMH," 384). The essay's sophisticated
and ironic partisanship becomes evidence of keen discrimination among
various cultural goods, bolstering Beerbohm's self-presentation as
music-hall aficionado. His middle-class readers, likewise, are solicited
to vote with their feet in the cultural marketplace, to patronize a
cultural form which the critic has termed "grotesque," but also "older"
and "better," and not merely the most fashionable, luxurious, or merely
available. If Beerbohm lays claim to a possession of and makes common
cause with expert rhetoric, his readers are invited to do the same,
to fashion themselves as a taste &eacute;lite.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite his condescension to the lumpen qualities he savors in music-hall,
there is an expansive aspect to Beerbohm's often cautious praise for
the form. His readers, he assumes, require guidance in negotiating a
post-literate world, where images, song, and spectacle dominate ever more
extensive realms of common experience. The dulcet tones of traditional
high culture may no longer suffice for advancing modernity, and this
very doubt bolsters faith in a compensatory expertise and authority that
can be achieved within the popular itself. The critic who works with
and upon the popular thereby assumes a new service role to readers,
training members of the dominant class in the special apprehension of
minority culture. Getting popular culture right offers the interpreter
a crucial edge over both the people and a majority of the public. Put
another way, Beerbohm's lament for the fading, vulgar halls functions
to put middle-class readers in touch with their inner aristocrat.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, the music-hall lament touches on professional
ideology. Since the popular has now been re-constituted as a knowledge
source, it must be hoarded as symbolic capital, with access to the
fund guarded. This parallels a step in the consolidation process of
professional identity as it has been identified by Magali Larson.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 At some point in the development of a profession, experts typically
 sustain their own identity by limiting the number of applicants who
 can be credentialed within a field. The exclusionary clause is usually
 aided by agencies outside the profession, often within the state. As
 a species of professional discourse, the music-hall lament includes an
 analogous moment when the critic looks outside his class / readership to
 consolidate the assertion of critical authority, looks instead to the
 concept or image of the nation to sanction their judgments of taste,
 and underwrites their rhetorical authority. Once English music-hall
 has been transformed into the "popular," and the popular has been

<B></B>

legitimated as a valid kind of knowledge, its adepts require a concept
of centralized authority to ensure their status. The nation does this
by metonymy. Cognoscenti pay back the privilege by reading the varied
content of the popular back into the national record.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music-hall inhabited a relatively subordinate place within the larger
culture; yet intellectuals seemed determined to claim and realize a far
more central place for it. Theirs was an attempt to broaden the terrain
encompassed by the cultural center; as a form of art and ritual, music
hall would be endowed with depth and gravity befitting its resonance
within English history. The late-Victorian compromise on the halls did
not simply sneer at the vulgarity of music-hall, but rather worried
over the meaning of vulgarity. In music-hall practice it hunted out
hints of the form's deep significance, complex truths about national
identity and history. Intellectuals, in return, could gain much from
their traffic with music hall. Increasingly marginalized in bourgeois
society by their advocacy of aesthetic value, they now endeavored to
gain a measure of credibility by insisting on the need for a middle-class
public to recognize value within the popular. In this regard, the English
popular resembles Clark's Parisian variant; middle-class identity and
authority are being consolidated by participating in and advocating
popular entertainment. Yet the popular, as defined by Clark, does not
dovetail perfectly with English circumstances. For in this instance,
not only did the critic lay claim to a certain discursive power, but
the ways in which the very notions of critical authority and hegemony
could be formulated were subtly transformed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can see these terms being negotiated in the debate over music-hall's
significance which took place in early 1914 between F. T. Marinetti,
the Futurist leader and theorist, and Gordon Craig, the English
theater critic and reformer. Marinetti's contribution to the debate,
"The Variety Theater," first appeared in Italian in October 1913; a
month later an English translation of it appeared under the title, "The
Meaning of the Music Hall"; and finally, in January, 1914, a new English
translation of it appeared, this time under the title "In Praise of the
Variety Theatre," published in Craig's own journal, printed in Florence,
<I>The Mask</I>. "In Praise of the Variety Theatre" is Marinetti's
most sustained attack on "the contemporary theatre." He urges that the
contemporary world demands a new kind of drama which should turn to "music
Halls, Caf&eacute;-chantants or equestrian circuses" for models. Indeed,
these are the only theatrical spectacles exclusively "worthy of a truly
futurist spirit." For the properly Futurist theater requires a denial
of history and tradition, which is precisely what music hall provides:
there is not "any kind of tradition: neither master nor dogmas."
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his rejoinder, which appeared in the same number of <I>The Mask</I>,
Craig singles out Marinetti's failure to discern the extensive history
and tradition of that lay behind music-hall, a failure implicit in his
anti-historical account of the halls. Drawing on the tradition epitomized
by Pennell and Beerbohm, Craig patiently underscores how music-hall
comprises and collates the very stuff of history. When Marinetti claims
it a virtue of music hall that "serious men never go to a variety show,"
Craig counters: "I do. I now go very often to a Variety Theatre and to
the Cinematograph," noting that "to watch how the conditions of these
two places of amusement vary is of considerable interest to me."
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Like Arthur Symons, Craig insists that apparently undifferentiated

<B></B>

sites of mere vulgarity in fact boast a rich and surprising diversity.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 And, like Pennell, Craig emphasizes the accumulation of tradition
 compressed in music-hall song stylings and sketch comedy. Pointedly
 diverging from Marinetti, Craig firmly insists that music-hall is "as old
 as the valleys." To Marinetti's primitivist passion, Craig replies with
 tempered appreciation. True, Craig's statement slights the popular; "old
 as the valleys" can imply that popular entertainment is merely natural,
 intuitive activity, as opposed to something learned or cultivated. But
 the exchange revealingly suggests the range and state of contemporary
 discourse about the English popular. Marinetti's polemical attempt to
 equate popular culture with variety theater and primitive vitality could
 not be accepted by Craig or other English readers without conceptual
 clarification and some required historicizing.

G.H. Mair's 1916 essay, "The Music Hall," was published in <I>The English
Review</I>, a journal which addressed a smaller, more intellectual
audience. Mair's essay, which almost takes for granted music hall's
predominance in the London artistic scene, insists that music hall is
a proud cultural resource. Its credibility resides in its reflective
illumination of English character, an argument which easily aligns
with Pennell's sense of music- hall pedigree. The halls join transient
performance with historical tradition, suggesting the continuing vitality
of both. Music-hall embodies a continuous history, because:

it has preserved the salient qualities of its ancestry--its delight
in virtuosity, in the pleasure of a thing well done, its sense of an

nourishment from beneath the shams on the surface of our civilization,
from the lasting permanent things.

Arguments concerning the natural strength and continuity of English
character assume ideological overtones, and Mair strikes a new note in the
discourse of music-hall when he proudly claims that it has transformed
London into a repository of world culture. "Just because [music-hall]
has this vitality, this close and intimate bond with its audience,
the music-hall is . . . incomparably the most elastic" ("MH," 126). He
offers a detailed inventory which suggests his satisfaction with these
attainments, all secured by music-hall:

Here, Mair echoes Pennell's fear that music-hall will be unable to sustain

essays by Max Beerbohm, offers a different, much darker account of the
form's current state, one which names the new forces that are challenging
popular music-hall, threatening to end its dominance as a ritual, and with
it a continuity in the experience of Englishness. "There are pessimists,"
he observes, "who believe that the heyday of the music-hall is over. A
plethora of internationalism, respectability and syndicated halls has
smothered, so they say, the native Anglo-Saxon vulgarity and individualism
which was its chiefest glory; and the sketch, the moving pictures and

was his hobby, his avocation, the thing at which he shone in all his
splendour. . . . All the circumstance and traditionof the business he
knew, as his betters might know a liturgy or a ritual. ("MH," 127)

Mair's music-hall adept reveals the extent to which the critical
mainstream had assimilated what had once been an &eacute;lite minority's
critical expectations for the form, and how far the dominant agenda had
assimilated a concept of the popular associated with it. His account
presents us with an axiom that will serve as Eliot's first principle in
"Marie Lloyd," namely, that music-hall form has something to do with
the stuff of Englishness. Indeed, all the anxieties voiced by Mair's
music-hall fan--the dangers of commercial acceptability, the marketing
of music-hall, the growing success of moving pictures--return in Eliot's
apocalyptic view of the demise of music hall and Englishness. Both believe
that the halls stand in a mimetic relation to national character; both
invest the form with the accompanying <I>gravitas</I> of accumulated
English history and culture. Both voice considerable anxiety over the
possibility that the music hall may die and national identity will be
eclipsed as the audience for "authentic" music-hall dwindles. Both vilify
the cinema as an example of "inorganic" mass culture, to which the genuine
English popular stands in stark contrast as an ideal which has realized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did music-hall attest to seamless continuities in the history of English
culture, or did it attest to its twilight, its impending bankruptcy? Such
a question arose from what constitutes the stuff of legitimation within
this rhetoric. Elegiac writing about the music-hall staved off suspicions
that a new order might be emerging in which both the halls and the
ideals enshrined in the literature of music-hall apology would prove
outmoded. If the lament set music-hall legibility under the designation
of national character, it

<B></B>

also set the form and the accompanying concepts under considerable
strain. At the onset of a new century, the globe was shrinking,
colonialism was embattled, and new technologies of war, travel, and
information flow were poised to overtake and overwhelm the faith in
nation and Empire. For Mair, Craig, and other apologists for the halls,
the Shaman poet of the past also served to re the only possible
future for modern art worth having, where poets will receive the requisite
dignity. In Mair, music-hall is colored by the old hues of the confident
and expansive nation-state, along with the older tints of a previous
aesthetic contract: the old world of Bardic expression.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mair's survey of the music hall reveals the constant rhetorical strain
evident in contemporary writing about it. The delight in various
forms of national character and creativity alternates with fears of
depletion. Modernity threatens to consume the resources of national
expression and destroy their links with the past, leaving intellectuals to
memorialize a vanished history. Apologists for the halls, in contrast,
sanction a sentimental appreciation of that history which the halls
have allegedly condensed. One response to such a threat is to circle
up the wagons and protect whatever remains from outsiders. Inevitably,
both Beerbohm's patron of the "older and better" music-hall and Mair's
music-hall acolyte sound a protectionist note concerning the dangers
facing English culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was within the conventions of this ambivalent tradition that Eliot's
essay on Marie Lloyd took shape, grounded in a notion of England which
for Eliot assumed "classical proportions, as Alan Marshall has put it,
an ideal and organic England with a unified tradition of practice and
character, and a sense of music hall which required a tone of elegiac
despair.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The essay posits the natural priority of local communication over
 mediated "art," music-hall over film, original performance over mere
 reproduction. The "working man who went to the music-hall and saw
 Marie Lloyd" was "performing part of the act; he was engaged in that
 collaboration of the audience with artist which is necessary in all art"
 ("ML," 174). What is mourned with her passing is not simply the loss of
 a singer or a performing style, but the end of a privileged relation
 between intellectuals, now red by Lloyd, and culture, now red
 by the working class.

The disposable form of the new media is what Eliot believes to be

the new mass culture seeks to embody the popular even as it negates a real
relationship between that culture and national tradition. The products
of cinema stand outside national origin, or at least attain this heady
status by virtue of their global consumption. The commodified popular
represents a new cultural force, existing on a scale that Eliot dreads.

Lloyd's particular significance as popular representative emerges as
the essay's crucial topic. The meaning of representation here looks
back to the tradition of writing about music-hall as a re for
the popular; but it also comprises the new core insight standing at
the heart of Eliot's memorial. The singer stands as "representative"
in two conflicting senses. On the one hand, it is suggested that,
through song, Lloyd represents a fact of her nature, the working-class
world from which she came. For Eliot, she stands within English history
and within a recognizable, fixed cultural hierarchy. Her achievement
and status exhibit a triumphant lack of self-consciousness, attainment
gained without analysis. Her loss is all the more final because she is an
inexplicable original, although her fidelity to her class nature remains
in the last instance, "natural," that is uncritical, since it would be
natural for working-class artists to express themselves in footloose,
naughty, but instinctive, ways. In this reading Lloyd is representative,
and also "representable" within a traditional order. The old languages
of class and national verity which had been sounded in earlier laments
about the music-hall are recycled.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet in small touches rather than broad strokes, Eliot also expresses
another story here. He strives to suggest a core of difference that exists
within the popular, to indicate that representation within the popular
can comprise contingency rather than essence, and that contingency can
encompass even performers who seem to embody a seamless relation between
audience and artists. A year before the publication of "Marie Lloyd,"
Eliot writes of a Jewish-American performer on the London stage, Ethel
Levey; he is fascinated by her calculated delivery and icy, formal remove
from the ostensible content of her performance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Her type is quite different from that of Marie Lloyd or Nellie
Wallace. She is the most aloof and impersonal of personalities;
indifferent, rather than contemptuous, towards that audience . . . Hers
is not broad farce, but a fascinating inhuman grotesquerie; she plays for
herself rather than for the audience. Her art requires a setting which
(in this country) it has never had.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Levey, the range of English national character projected at the
halls becomes richer and more varied. Despite his familiarity with the
conventions of <I>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</I> appreciation of music-hall,
Eliot moves to a conception of the popular that accommodates difference
in ethnic or gendered performance styles, one that also distinguishes
among competing aesthetic possibilities within music hall form, ranging
from the fierce and forceful Englishness of singers such as Lloyd and
Nellie Wallace to the cooler, more cerebral presentations of performers
such as Levey. This conception of the popular is no longer the monolithic
one which characterized earlier writings about music hall.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Victorian compromise concerning music hall demanded that its
proper appreciation be set within a specific tale about England and its
people, and it slighted another aspect of music-hall performance which
Victorian observers surely suspected, but which Eliot is among the first
to articulate: that celebrities like Lloyd demonstrated unprecedented
freedom in staging their status as celebrities. Indeed, Eliot may well
have been drawing on popular tradition which noted and admired Lloyd's
ability to manipulate the space between the "vulgar" content of a song's
lyrics and her own identity, her capacity to construct and deconstruct her
own image. Witness the oft-repeated story concerning Lloyd's performance
before the censors. Lloyd, the legend goes, was once called before the
Licensing Committee of the London County Council and asked to perform
a song whose lyrics had caused complaint. She proceeded to perform the
number without elaboration and won the committee's approval. Then she
immediately launched into the innocuous parlor ballad, "Come into the
Garden, Maud," by Alfred Lord Tennyson, giving it a thoroughly lascivious
rendition. Even in the early days of Lloyd's career, when prostitution
in certain London halls (e.g., the Empire in Leicester Square) was so
conspicuous that it fueled fears that the halls and their songs fostered
public lewdness, reviewers had noted Lloyd's distance from the commercial
courtesans, a distance fashioned partly by her artful re-staging of
street life. <I>The Era</I>, a popular late-Victorian trade journal for
the halls, stressed the gulf between performance and essence in Lloyd;
her performance made it clear that she "studied the habits and manners
of pavement magdalenes with adequate care and attention," and without
risk of contamination.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lloyd's self-fashioning of her identity and celebrity resulted
in paradoxes. She was the very image of working-class lubricity, but
she also demonstrated her freedom from old rules by manipulating and
crafting the stuff of the vulgar. Something believed uncontrollable
sexuality, and in particular feminine sexuality, which was assumed to
exert predatory control over consciousness, could be crafted, stylized,
managed. As a celebrity, Lloyd occupied a contested territory which
encompassed a contradiction: she expressed erotic life as something
natural to working-class character, yet played with sexuality as spectacle
and construct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's essay on "Marie Lloyd" trucks with the ambiguities toward essence
and art which Lloyd herself had marshalled, developing insights which
do not fit within the conventions of writing about music hall. Eliot
underscores the degree to which the audience participated in Lloyd's
performances, becoming her collaborators, and this insight widens
the semantic range ascribed to the term "representation" within the
essay. For now representation stands as willed and artful manipulation,
rather than natural fact rendered visible through a prior context of
class or history. If an implied contract exists between performer and
audience, one which licenses the performer to express and represent the
audience, then Lloyd had pushed at the limits of her own contract. In
her self-conscious challenge to the expectations that singers stand in
for their audiences, Lloyd represents Eliot himself, in a startlingly
novel fashion. It is Eliot's experience in a life lived outside the
working-class, as much as her "native" working class, which gets clarified
through Lloyd's performance. She represents Eliot

<B></B>

in an individual capacity, as well as a public manner: in the private
world of the fantasist. Lloyd's ability to remake her identity in public
offers sanction for the poet's endeavor to displace the solid facts of
class and gender in order to maintain his fandom. She manipulates class
images with a liberty that threatens the hierarchical terms set within
the Victorian compromise, where aesthetic order relied upon acceptance
of essential class difference. The compromise was manifest in the
heaps of critical praise lavished on working-class people for seeming
to reproduce, rather than revise, their image and character. Lloyd's
liberties, however, correlate with the freedoms that Eliot naturally
assumes when he presumes that a working-class English woman represents
his own place, in the England of his imagining.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, Eliot's presumption that Lloyd can represent his interests and
desires touches on our own situation, our promiscuous affiliation with
various contemporary avatars of the popular. It hints at the realization
that notions like the body, the people, and woman are simply categories,
and accordingly, might be evaded, transgressed or displaced--indeed,
are fated to be so in a new order. Lloyd plays two roles in the essay
and Eliot articulates both. The singer represents her class; at the
same time, she speaks for Eliot, to push Ralph Ellison's phrase, on a
different frequency. That Lloyd represents Eliot in this new register
implies a shift, tacitly recognized by Eliot himself, within the protocols
of representation authorized by the late-Victorian popular. According
to the Victorian compromise, the representative quality of a popular
singer confirmed pre-existing beliefs about the nature of England and
Englishness. Lloyd's performance style does remind Eliot of continuity in
English identity and history; but it also suggests a fundamental shift
within the structure of the popular, which previous intellectuals had
tended to homogenize.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Representation is not the only term in Eliot's essay which contains more
than one set of meanings. Science is another. It stands for a realm
of universal truths which will ratify what otherwise might be Eliot's
purely subjective impressions, but it also names the forces which are
fostering the new global order that is threatening the order of values
reflected in the stories which earlier critics have told about national
culture. It was, of course, nothing new for Eliot to invoke science in
his critical prose, as readers of "Tradition and the Individual Talent"
will readily recall, in which metaphors from chemistry are used to
suggest the clarity and precision of the author's arguments over the
imprecise thinking that by implication dominates the humanities.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In "Marie Lloyd" it is anthropology which is called on to provide the
 hard, factual basis for Eliot's dark speculation that contemporary
 culture is dying. Science marks the saving difference between his
 apocalyptic warnings and the dyspeptic rumblings of the Victorian
 sage. At the same time, however, the world-weariness that ethnographer
 W. H. R. Rivers diagnoses in his subject group of Melanesians, degraded
 by their encounter with the scientific products and cultural vacuum
 of Western modernity, provides an analogue to the cultural leveling
 Eliot discerns in English audiences who can no longer appreciate
 the music-hall. This contradiction gives the essay a burdensome
 ambiguity. Science grounds the author's cultural authority, yet it
 also represents the very forces that are endangering the fragile art
 of music-hall. The new kind of popular which is emerging

<B></B>

under impress of advancing science performs in ways that render
unnecessary the conventional story about national history which was
thought to be epitomized in the music-hall. Science underwrites the
conquest of distance and makes possible a global stance that threatens
the coherence of stories about a national, homogenous cultural legacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Rivers's Melanesians only appear to designate a cosmopolitan range of
experience which exists outside the nation. Their allegorical import is
more primary, for they re the experience of cultural decline which
is occurring in a specifically English context. They stand in for the
native English. Blame for the cultural negligence of music-hall does
not fall with them; the blindness of the English to the art in their
midst is due to cultural preconditioning and the materialist ethos of
scientific progress. The Melanesians are proof that the people, faced
with the choices presented by a widely dispersed media culture, will
inevitably desecrate truly popular art. Indigenous peoples, including
the English working class, are fated to become demoralized by the forces
of a new world order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet's dark apprehension stems from the deeper realization that
a certain kind of critical project has passed with Lloyd. The literary
professional, an expert at describing cultural work within the parameters
of the nation, is losing ground to another expert, the producer utilizing
"rapid-breeding" technology (e.g., cinema) to create transnational
works. The literary intellectual owes fealty to culture as defined by
specific, local manifestations, and the new global culture is outside his
purview. Albeit implicitly, "Marie Lloyd" contains an embryonic awareness
of the new role which the popular might assume in a world organized by
a global distribution of information and commodities, but the point is
left undeveloped, perhaps because Eliot clings to an exhausted notion of
the popular. From late-Victorian to modernist, from Pennell to Eliot,
lamenting the decline of music-hall had conferred critical purchase
on a corps of expert observers who presented themselves as capable
of discerning cultural achievement even in its decadence. The loss of
Marie Lloyd and the imminent end of music-hall signify the passing of
that project. Eliot's essay marks the final stand for one version of the
myth of the intellectual, one in which he or she served as professional
tutor for a public. That compact between the modern critic and reader
was grounded in the loyalty of both to notions of cultural and national
homogeneity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "Marie Lloyd," Eliot all but foresees the demise of that world;
institutions of taste making that once cordoned off the popular are
being cast aside. In the new world which Eliot sees at hand, consumers
have access to an increasingly wider range of artistic options and
consciousness is permeated by the reproduction and circulation of
interiorities utterly divorced from their point of origin. Identity
markers are merely a purchase away. Even dissent can be downloaded. Racial
integration may be remote in real life, but fantasies of it are on
sale for compensatory use. Identity models for affluent white youth,
whether they express outrage, cool, or sexual confidence, leap over
racial boundaries; exemplars are as likely to be culled from hip-hop as
European art song, or from parental collections of mainstream pop. The
popular is distributed everywhere today, and is the foundation of
globalization. Defined around the commodity, identity itself becomes
plural and variegated, accommodating plural selves, not uniform souls.

<B></B>

We can be certain only that the aesthetic exemplars for our individual
fantasies of identification and representation cannot simply be read
off by the coordinates of their original social rank.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Marie Lloyd" foreshadows this new dispensation, even if it does so only
negatively as it announces an end to the old compact among criticism,
national identity, and the popular, a compact withering in the face of
global capitalism, with its enlarged markets and heightened capacity to
move cultural products across borders. The passing of Lloyd has fixed
Eliot's certainty that she spoke for both her audience and himself in a
manner that has transgressed the conventional high / low hierarchy; she
had created a new world where identification and imagination spilled over
old boundaries. Class difference, and perhaps difference in general,
no longer present a real barrier which separates the authority of
middle-class gourmands from the cultural products they savor and esteem.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fears expressed in "Marie Lloyd" and its chiliastic stance are
wildly overblown. Our current cultural situation may suggest that the
lament for Lloyd is fully justified, but that Eliot's concern over the
end of a middle class dominion over aesthetic evaluation has been proved
premature. Eliot, in mourning the loss of a compact which had permitted
intellectuals to redeem the popular and exert enough authority to make
this recognition of difference matter, also articulates the desire of
modern subjects to sentimentalize difference for culture's sake. And after
all, sentimentalizing difference is also the mean whereby contemporary
culture fits professional culture to the popular. And now, as then, what
gets sentimentalized is class; critics have never lost their belief that
genuine culture transcends its origins, or that its reception somehow
cancels out class realities. The sentimental popular treats real social
inequity and barriers as imaginary. That formula for cultural hegemony
of the new middle-class intellectuals has long outlasted the music-hall,
and for all we know, it may well survive the imagined community forged
by cinematic culture.

Eric Lott uses Clark's gloss on Eliot to read the composite, multi-class

c. 1888-1907, and English Modernism," <I>Modernism /Modernity</I>
7 (April 2000): 285-306. Like these writers, I build on Clark's
claims concerning the genesis of the modern popular in nineteenth-century
mass leisure forms, and I share Clark's understanding of the popular as
a favorite discursive form of the new professional classes. However,
I resist the implication that the popular had a simple functional use
as a working-class containment for the class promulgating the notion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT3" HREF="#REF3">3</A>.
Actually, on this point Clark's taut analysis of class and custom
goes slack. He characterizes lower middle-class audiences for
caf&eacute;-chantant as "connoisseurs of popular culture," proud
experts who "define[d] themselves by their difference from the popular
but also their possession of it" and that this possession offered this
class fraction an edge over the "mere" working-class; see <I>POML</I>,
237. Clark similarly describes the caf&eacute;-chantant paintings by
educated bohemians like Degas and Manet as the work of knowing and
superior aficions of the popular. However, terms like "professional"
and "expert" are stretched thin in the rush to harmonize these
different instances as single manifestations of a repressive culture
of professionalism. The homologies result from Clark's treatment of
the rising managerial middle-class as both a grand transformation and
mere capitalist business as usual. But not everyone is recognized as an
expert to the same degree: and either professional culture produced a new
dominant class, concerned with articulating its own codes, tastes and
opinions, or it did not. The same inconsistency toward the managerial
class (workers who are neither working-class nor owners, and wielding
power on the basis of training and credentials rather than property
or financial holdings) tempers the achievement of what remains the
classic sociological treatment of the "new class" by Barbara and John
Ehrenreich. The Ehrenreichs provide evidence that the consolidation
of professional structures reshaped the capitalist division of labor,
yet conclude by asserting that "to the extent that the PMC established
itself . . . it did so on terms set by the capitalist class." See "The
Professional-managerial class," in <I>Between Labor and Capital</I>
ed. Pat Walker (Boston: South End Press, 1979). My reading here has its
genesis in reading the introduction to Mark Garrett Cooper's forthcoming
<I>Visual Love Story: How Silent Hollywood Incorporated America</I>
(forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press). A conviction that
professional culture transformed how capitalists wielded power underlies
my essay; accordingly, I maintain that expert culture must be treated
with a degree of specificity. My conception of the late Victorian English
managerial class as a cadre of culture mavens and hedonists is influenced
by Immanuel Wallenstein's witty and acute psychological profile of the
professional class, "The Bourgeoisie--Concept or Reality," in <I>The

In the period between 1888 and 1914, an abundance of periodical essays
seeking to interpret the deep significance of London music-hall commercial
success saw print. Most of these essays assumed that the new prominence
of music-hall resided in its ability to affect and reflect national
character for good or ill. Such essays include James Payn, "The Music
Hall," <I>Cornhill</I> 60 (July 1889): 68-79; F. Anstey, "London
Music halls," <I>Harpers Magazine</I> 82 (January 1891): 190-202;

the possibly most influential of essays within this genre, authored by
Elizabeth Pennell.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT5" HREF="#REF5">5</A>.
Ronald Schuchard shows how Eliot's earliest pronouncements on music-hall
fit within the spirit of late Victorian discourse on the form, which
held that it had value as heritage culture. The Victorian cognoscenti
especially admired how music-hall seemed to express, or perhaps construct,
English character. He cites Eliot's 1921 essay, "The Romantic Englishman,
the Comic Spirit, and the Function of Criticism," which asserts that "it
is only perhaps in the music-halls" that once robust antique images of
English character, of John Bull, retain vital life. See <I>EDA</I>, 106.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT6" HREF="#REF6">6</A>.
Schuchard views Eliot as "the last inheritor of the music-hall mystery,"
who sorts "the unsifted residue of the 1890s" (<I>EDA,</I> 104).

<a NAME="FOOT7" HREF="#REF7">7</A>.
It is worth remarking that the distinction between mass culture and
the popular articulated and maintained by fin-de-si&egrave;cle and
Edwardian music-hall observers does not resemble the traditional high /
low divide that scholars typically draw, but plays according to more or
less compelling versions of public culture. Intellectuals with managerial
aspirations gained a measure of authority from recognizing and presiding
over this difference, but the management logic refused to follow a
strict binary. I am not alone in making revisionist claims on modernist
culture divide rhetoric. See Corbett, cited above, but also Alison Pease,
"Readers with Bodies: Modernist Criticism's Bridge across the Cultural
Divide," <I>Modernism / Modernity</I> 7 (January 2000): 77-99;
David Chinitz, "T.S. Eliot and the Cultural Divide," <I>PMLA</I> 110
: 236-48; Michael North, <I>Reading 1922</I> (Oxford: Oxford
UP, 1999), 140-73. A claim by North is especially relevant to my
argument: that "modernism and popular culture" are "natural associates,"
a subset of "a larger cultural change in which public life and private
consciousness came to be dominated by representations, by images"
(North, <I>Reading 1922</I>, 141).

These programmatic pieces include "The Blight on Music Hall," ,

to adulation. They work with a deceptive formal ease and apparent
simplicity, which never fully conceals the complex emotional range
at their core. With "At the Music Hall," (<I>Saturday Review</I> [20

stupidity and cultural abjection. Nonetheless, the halls still emerge as a
cultural oasis in a period otherwise marked by sharp disjunctions between
artist, craft, and audience demand. He idealizes performer and public
in sharp statements such as this: "Turn by turn, these entertainments
have grown up with reference to nothing but the public's own needs and
aspirations. There is no compromise, no friction, between the form and
the audience. The audience is the maker of the form, the form is the
symbol of the audience." The statement reads like a codicil on Pennell's
music-hall treatise; but the keen sense of the value of music-hall for the
augmentation of critical authority is Beerbohm's own. "And thus a Music
Hall offers always a great chance to any student of humanity at large."

Ezra Pound's "parleyings with Browning" are most apparent in the
conception of the earliest Cantos.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Pound left little other direct commentary on the ways in which Browning's
 work influenced his own literary endeavors, although he frequently
 acknowledged Browning to be among the greatest poetic geniuses since
 Dante, one of the few that modern England had brought forth.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It has often been noted that Pound's early poetry imitates Browning's
 masks and the convolutions, colloquial tone, and rich, rugged rhythm of
 Browning's style. In his poem "Mesmerism" from 1906 Pound pays parodic
 tribute: "Here's to you, Old Hippety-Hop o' the accents."
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The tone of <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, where Pound stages his exasperating
 effort of comprehending Browning's <I>Sordello</I>, is still dominated
 by such a self- ironizing admixture of irreverence and admiration.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet, <I>Three Cantos</I> also gives more complex testimony, both of
 Pound's deep indebtedness to Browning and of his struggle for poetic
 originality. Designed to be the exordium of Pound's modern epic, <I>Three
 Cantos 1</I> in its first lines evokes Browning's <I>Sordello</I>as
 a precursor text that is the unique example for a new form: a "bag
 of tricks" for poetic renewal, "a rag-bag" for modern consciousness,
 a theater for disembodied speech.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
Hang it all, there can be but one <I>Sordello</I>!

<BR>
Your <I>Sordello</I>, and that the modern world
<BR>

<BR>

<B></B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Quarreling with his muse, throughout <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound points
out Browning's "quirks and tweeks," the jarring idiosyncrasies of his
poetry. A few lines offer a parody &agrave; la "Mesmerism": "Tower by
tower / Red-brown the rounded bases, and the plan / Follows the builder's
whim.  Beaucaire's slim gray / Leaps from the stubby base of Altaforte"
(<I>P</I>, 229).
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Others comment directly on <I>Sordello'</I>s confoundingly convoluted,
  allusive language and risky rhyming of the seemingly incompatible: "What
  a hodge podge you have made there!--/ <I>Zanze</I> and <I>swanzig</I>,
  of all opprobrious rhymes!" (<I>P</I>, 232).
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet it is precisely this daring strategy of assembling the disparate
 that Pound finds intriguing. He suggests that Browning created a text
 that borders on the grotesque: half epic, half burlesque romance--"The
 rough men swarm out / In robes that are half Roman, half like the
 Knave of Hearts"(<I>P</I>, 229).He particularly dwells on Browning's
 montage of historical res, facts, events, and settings. He knowingly
 appraises Browning's "bag of tricks," devices for putting historical
 and literary tradition to free poetic use, as he points out that
 Browning falsely implied Sordello to be Dante's sole forerunner that
 he borrowed from Arnaut Daniel (whom Pound in turn had portrayed as a
 forerunner of Dante's in <I>The Spirit of Romance</I>) "that trick /
 Of the unfinished address," and that Browning disregards chronology:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Alluding to the rags of <I>Sordello'</I>s narrator's motley dress,
Pound labels a "rag-bag" Browning's technique of employing background
materials, his drawing together bits and pieces into a plethora of
textual and historical details. Pound implies that Browning has given
him a good excuse for similarly pouring out on the public shore whatever
he has gathered from the ocean of his readerly consciousness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Pound was not to retain this image in later versions of <I>The
Cantos</I>, it is a metaphor for the technique he sets out to develop:
the collecting of luminous concretenesses from the poet's store of
knowledge for the rag-and-bone-shop of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first decade of <I>The Cantos</I>'s composition and revision has
offered critics a natural place to look for the formative ideas behind
the work as a whole<I>.</I>
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Various critics have dwelt on the fact that the drastic reduction of
 allusions to <I>Sordello</I> coincides with

<B></B>

an elliptical compression of Pound's language that helped introduce a
new era in modernist writing. One common conclusion has been that Pound
exorcised Browning from his <I>Cantos</I> in order to replace his own
Browningesque "quirks and tweeks" with an original, modern poetic form.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 More recent criticism, most notably Mary Ellen Gibson's, has tended
 to acknowledge that neither in his letters and critical prose, where
 he returned to him again and again as a point of reference, nor in his
 poetry did Pound ever completely turn away from Browning.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Pound's reading of <I>Sordello</I>in <I>Three Cantos</I> indeed
 reveals how Pound explicitly worked his way toward <I>remaking</I>
 Browning, rather than <I>exorcising</I> him. Pound regards
 <I>Sordello</I>simultaneously as a particular text and as an
 "art-form." Only with great difficulty, Pound seems to say, can this
 form be abstracted from <I>Sordello</I> and applied to Pound's own
 composition. Pound writes to his father in 1915 that <I>Sordello</I>
 is a "great work and worth the trouble of hacking it out" (quoted in
 <I>GEPC</I>, 75). In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, he exhorts himself that in
 order to remake <I>Sordello</I>, rather than to incise it or scratch
 away at its surface, he needs to penetrate it, to chisel out its core:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Ronald Bush has pointed out, Pound apparently was one of the first
readers fully to understand that <I>Sordello'</I>s initial narrator is
the poet as a motley fool in a marketplace, who, having propped up his
show-booth and summoned up a community of dead poets as his audience,
keeps himself "out of view," hidden inside the booth in which he sets
out to "make speak . . . the very man [Sordello] as he was wont to do"
(<I>S</I>, 1, 15- 16). The poetic self has disappeared inside its
stage, the unfolding discourse itself. In <I>Three Cantos</I>, Pound
directs our view to this process and fathoms its implications for his
own art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ur-Cantos explicitly discuss Pound's preoccupation with finding a
poetic self, which was evident also in his previous experimentation with
Browningesque dramatic masks. In 1969, Hugh Witemeyer drew attention to
Pound's investigation of <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, a concept he derived from
Renaissance poets through Walter Pater: of how he could create a unified,
idiosyncratic, and yet disembodied, transsubjective, poetic force.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Pound's idea of <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, Witemeyer has convincingly argued,
 in essence underlay all of his subsequent aesthetic terminology, from
 "vortex" and "image" to "ideogram" and "paideuma." Yet Witemeyer did
 not acknowledge Browning's significance for this continuity within
 Pound's aesthetic. "Pound did not leap full-grown from the brow of
 Browning," Witemeyer asserted, claiming that, in order to come of age
 as a poet, Pound first had to move beyond <I>Sordello</I> toward Joyce,
 and beyond Browning's personae (which, he argued, never serve "as a
 means of self-construction" but "relive all the possible attitudes of
 the human spirit") toward a modernist construction of poetic selfhood.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 What is missing from Witemeyer's account is what Christine Froula has

<B></B>

since supplied: an acknowledgement that <I>Sordello</I>is a transitional,
proto-modernist text.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As the following shall show, Pound saw what he understood by
 <I>virt&ugrave;</I> already contemplated in Browning. The effort to
 create an idiosyncratic poetic self whose expressive power transcends
 subjectivity toward a stronger recreation of cultural reality is already
 at the heart both of <I>Sordello'</I>s narrative and technique.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Witemeyer's assessment that Browning's personae never serve "as a means
of self-construction" does not entirely agree with Pound's reading of
<I>Sordello</I>in <I>Three Cantos 1.</I> There, Pound quotes from a
brief address prefacing the revised 1863 edition of <I>Sordello</I>,
in which Browning chose to highlight that <I>Sordello</I> was "the story
of the development of a soul."
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

Pound recognizes that Browning's poem gives both epic and dramatic
dimensions to a half-historical, half-fictional narrative in the
form of a Dantesque transcendental journey--a journey, as Pound also
understands, that recasts the author's own making and history of
meta-poetic meditations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Pound ponders here are the complications in Browning's mediation of
poetic self. He wonders at the ways in which Browning's poem <I>is</I>
a means of self-construction while it simultaneously strives to live up
to the poetic ideal Browning had developed in his "Essay on Shelley":
the ideal of a poetic objectivity that would synthesize the poet's
subjectivity with transpersonal truth.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many critics have pointed out that Browning's "story of a development
of a soul" throughout at least the first three books of the poem closely
resembles his own endeavor to overcome Shelley's Promethean subjectivism.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The last third of Book 1 introduces young Sordello at Goito, an idyllic
 castle in the country near Mantua, secluded from

<B></B>

the town by a "slough" and "pine tree forests" (<I>S</I>, 1, 374). There,
under the tutelage of the Ghibelline countess Adelaide, Sordello enjoys
a sheltered upbringing reminiscent of Browning's own, which he passed
in the household of his parents and among the books of his father's
library. Sordello is surrounded by playful architecture, art objects,
and a pastoral garden landscape charged with the inviting mystique that
a childlike imagination projects.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Recalling his own poetic beginnings under the influence of Romanticism,
 Browning casts himself in the form of a young Sordello "less like a
 Troubadour than one of Shelley's protagonists," open to the influx of
 divine inspiration (<I>GEPC</I>, 83).

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to the "legend" of Romanticism the true genius, like Shelley's
Prometheus, defies the gods with his own transcendental aspirations
(<I>S</I>, 1, 516). This early life is for the first time overshadowed
by crisis when the question arises how the poet can really be "equal to
being all" without taking charge in the present affairs of his people
(cf. <I>S</I>, 1, 535-47, as quoted below).Affairs in Northern
Italy around 1224--the turmoil of Guelf and Ghibelline partisanship,
particularly the Ghibelline general Taurello Salinguerra's climactic
capture of the Guelf Count Boniface in the long-besieged Ferrara, and
the effects of civil warfare on the spirit of the divided population
in Verona--have been dramatized throughout most of the preceding
portions of Book 1. Now the narrator instructs himself: "Go back to the
beginning, rather; blend / It gently with Sordello's life" (<I>S</I>,
1, 597-8). In his "drowsy Paradise," Sordello grows a poetic soul
increasingly inclined, as Browning was himself, to observe the warts
of nature, the monstrosity of particulars, giving "to familiar things a
face grotesque; / Only, preserving through the mad burlesque / A grave
regard" (<I>S</I>, 1, 267; <I>S</I>, 1, 655-57). While he is thus
developing the first traces of his own <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, Sordello's
true initiation begins only as his yearnings for an audience urge him
to penetrate the forests that surround him in his seclusion, to go to
Mantua to become a Troubadour. There, Sordello defeats his forerunner,
the celebrated Troubadour Eglamor, in a spontaneous contest, a victory
that leads to Eglamor's death and wins Sordello Palma's favor--his
palm/Palma, reminiscent of the Petrarchan laurel/Laura--and appointment
as her Trouvere. Confronted with an audience, Sordello gives up demanding
that "'each shall love in me the love that leads / His soul to power's
perfection'" (<I>S</I>, 2, 439-40). His goal becomes to achieve a
more objective poetry that would, in the very expression of poetic self,
render a realistic and thus morally responsible picture of the all of
human experience. He takes on the task of reaching out to the actual
world of living men: of authentically portraying the struggles of the
individual existence through his crafting of dramatic personae and speech
(cf. <I>S</I>, 2, 568-87).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, as Pound notes, in <I>Sordello</I>this struggle for a new aesthetic
is not only mediated by the story of strife and repeated disappointments,
or the "marrow" of the meta-poetic discourse; it is also enacted in
narrative, dramatic, and poetic technique. If the presentation of Sordello
includes from the start that of Browning's own aesthetic becoming, it
likewise includes a plurality of articulations, a multitude of beings,
a community of voices, because the voice of the poem's evanescent motley
narrator, who is also a stand-in for the poet, is open to all kinds
of intrusions.

Here we find yet another version of the poet's self speaking, the
"meditative" voice, in Pound's phrase, in which contemplations on the
literary history of ideas mingle with scenes of Sordello's upbringing,
and then moreover the "murmur" of a chorus of speakers is quoted, perhaps
the ghosts of the Romantics. Their speech is then objected to by what
seems to be still another guise of the narrative voice, the race of men
addressing Sordello:

The motley speaker is the presiding narrator of the poem not so much
as the caricature that we actually see at the beginning of the poem,
but as the idea of the poet-self that overarches the poem's dramatic
technique. He embodies the poet not only clothed in the garment of
the poem's time, but altogether made up of patchwork, a theatrical
multitude. Like Browning in <I>Sordello</I> and his dramatic monologues,
the motley speaker speaks through the ghosts of the past he summons,
precursor poets and historical res, and is spoken through by them. His
voice is a stage for the presence of the

<B></B>

past--"Ghosts move about me / Patched with histories," comments his
reader Pound. <I>Sordello</I>, which Pound called "one of the finest
masks ever presented," finally sets an example for Pound.
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In it, the poet is poetic subject and object alike, and self is visibly
 transformed into a composite artifact, the text itself: "To paint, more
 real than any dead Sordello, / The half or third of your intensest life /
 And call that third <I>Sordello</I>" (<I>P</I>, 229-30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mary Ellis Gibson gives us what may be the definitive reading of
Pound's negotiation of Browningesque selfhood when, in her 1995 study
<I>Epic Reinvented: Ezra Pound and the Victorians</I>, sheargues that,
in the model of the poet as ragpicker that Pound adopts from Browning,
poetic self-creation and the epic quest for a renewal of the poetic
canon are one.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In any event, the question of how the poet realizes his
 <I>virt&ugrave;</I> and thus makes tradition new--how the individual
 poet res among and in turn affects the guise of those ghosts
 of literary history he summons--is not only the central question in
 <I>Three Cantos</I>but already a topos in <I>Sordello</I>itself. In
 the early stages of his poetic making at Goito, Sordello's talent is
 still overshadowed by his awe for the mighty Troubadour Eglamor at
 the Mantuan court, as well as Sordello's overall indebtedness to the
 literary past: "nor bid / Me rag by rag expose how patchwork hid /
 The youth--what thefts of every clime and day / Contributed to purfle
 the array / He climbed with" (<I>S</I>, 1, 897-901). Browning's
 poetic self emerging in the mask of Sordello here explicitly resembles
 the speaker's motley dress. Sordello's patchwork in this instance is
 still a sign of poverty of mature wit, a fault against which Pound
 warns his fellow poets in his early criticism, probably with his own
 endeavors to overcome his "Browningese" in mind: in "A Retrospect,"
 a collection of earlier pieces of criticism published in <I>Pavannes
 and Divisions</I> in 1918, he writes, "Don't allow 'influence' to mean
 merely that you mop up the particular decorative vocabulary of some
 one or two poets whom you happen to admire."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Browning's poem suggests a much more complex, transhistorical model of
 literary influence that anticipates Pound's. The elder troubadour Eglamor
 is to Sordello what Shelley is to Browning, and eventually Browning to
 Pound. Dante and Shelley are to Browning's <I>Sordello</I>what Sordello
 is to the <I>Purgatory</I> and eventually Browning to <I>The Cantos</I>,
 a ghost conjured up fleetingly, but whose work offers itself throughout
 for use and revision to the present poet.

In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound looks for a suitable persona to integrate
such complex relationships:

Pound answers to himself: "Not Arnaut, not De Born, not Uc St. Circ"
(<I>P</I>, 232), thereby echoing what Bush describes as <I>Sordello's</I>
narrator's "coming to terms with images of

<B></B>

his older failed poetic self" and at the same time reiterating his own
efforts in <I>Personae</I>, where Pound had cast off "complete masks of
the self in each poem" (<I>GEPC</I>, 83). <I>Three Cantos 2</I> still
comments directly on <I>Sordello'</I>s theme of successive poetic selves
and eras: "Another crown, thrown to another dancer, brings you to modern
times?" (<I>P</I>, 240). Yet already in Browning there is no clear linear
succession; Eglamor's, Sordello's, and Dante's achievements simultaneously
crowd the concluding reflections of <I>Sordello</I><I>.</I> The dynamic
of Browning's "semi-epic" literary quest integrates the circularity and
polyphonic contemporaneity of sacred history in a framework of perpetual
dramatic conflict. As he announces in <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound
will have to consider the "trick" of Browning's "showman's booth." He
prepares to take his efforts out into some forum and establish his own
kind of polyphony.

<I>Three Cantos</I>'s ultimate background, materials that Pound introduces
in <I>Three Cantos 3</I> and will eventually rework in Canto 1 to replace
<I>Three Cantos 1</I><I>,</I> is Andreas Divus's Latin translation of
Book 11 of <I>The Odyssey</I>. There, Odysseus conjures up the spirits of
the past from Hades and makes them speak through the ghost of Tiresias by
feeding him blood. Browning gives a dramatized version of the same epic
topos at the beginning of his poem, thus prering one of the central
motifs of <I>The Cantos</I><I>.</I> Just as Browning's motley alter ego
summons a community of poets from the past, indicating that the poem draws
heavily on literary traditions and in turn is directed toward an audience
of co-creators, so the blind seer Tiresias offers for interpretation a
panhistorical glimpse to Odysseus, the future creator of civic order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The relationships among poet, epic, and world are negotiated in a
striking section at the symmetrical axis of <I>Sordello</I>to which
Pound paid particular attention. Browning-in-the-process-of-composition
takes over the narrative voice and more or less retains it for the almost
five hundred lines, concluding Book 3. Browning separates himself from
his poem as if it were a living world, yet one animated only while he
dreams it: "They sleep, and I awake / . . . being at Venice" (<I>S</I>, 3,
614-15). As if still in transition between such dreaming and waking,
Browning's voice meditates on the relations between those two realities,
the poet's and his work's. Commenting on his own poetic aspirations as
much as Sordello's, Browning portrays the creative process as an epic
sea voyage, and concludes that, as the work travels on alone in history,
only the audience can redeem the poet's transcendental force that his
work contains:  "no other may . . . be informed what fate / Intends,
if triumph or decline await / The tempter of the everlasting steppe"
(<I>S</I>, 3, 673-75).

The poet interprets his present reality in the light of his work in
progress. He seeks a "queen" just as Sordello had "demand[ed] a Palma"
earlier:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Palma (based on the historical Sordello's Cunizza and an analogue
to Dante's Beatrice), is an allegory of poetic glory, or "peace in
strife." She guides Sordello's poetic ascent toward the secret of
experience: moral awareness of an "out-soul," that is, Being as it
suffuses the yet alien "out-world" (<I>S</I>, 3, 319; <I>S</I>, 1,
757). Love for her transmutes both self and other in a poetic fulfillment
of Being and Knowledge: "the Use of Life, / An Alien turning Native to
the soul / Or body." Inspired by Palma, briefly before Browning's voice
intervenes, Sordello resolves to be "Gate-vein of this heart's blood
of Lombardy" (what Dante sees in Sordello in the <I>Purgatory</I>),
an embodiment of both poetic and political fraternity, an "aggregate /
Of souls and bodies" (<I>S</I>, 3, 556-60). He is now intent on
battling the "ignominious exile of mankind," even at the risk of his
own ignominious exile for his convictions (<I>S</I>, 3, 580).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As he overlooks a Venetian piazza, Browning's search for an equivalent
incarnation of ideal femininity ironically settles on a pauper--"You
sad disheveled ghost / That pluck at me and point"--a girl who touches
him as she is begging for alms (<I>S</I>, 3, 664- 65). Like his
protagonist, Browning is compelled to open himself to the out-world of
"the common sort, the crowd," as he recognizes in the girl's countenance
the faces of the unfortunate multitude. Yet there is no revelatory
transformation, not even such a doomed one as Sordello's. In the poet's
immediate present the problems that the poem-in-progress presents are
only intensified; the relationships among poetic vision, poetic work,
and socio-political reality are even further complicated. Instead of
unmasking the spectacle of Sordello's life, Browning's voice at last
implies that an artificial dramatic hodge-podge offers a more reliable
reality than any immediate present:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Characteristically, as Book 3 concludes, the present voice of the poet
becomes submerged again more and more among the voices of Sordello's
realm, and finally completely among evocations of Greek mythology and
the New Testament. According to Browning, meaning and moral instruction
can no longer be drawn from visionary contemplation, but only from the
maze of assembled poetic history.

In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, where Pound wonders whether it is "worth the
[author's] evasion" not to show himself in his poetry, fifty lines
are heavily laden with references to the sequence concluding Book 3 of
<I>Sordello</I>, where it appears that Browning does show himself. Pound
writes: "I walk Verona (I am here in England)"--as Browning probably
already was again was when he wrote his description of Venice--"I can

Pound may have taken the image of the poppy from <I>Sordello</I>
(<I>S</I>, 1, 705-16), where it presents itself to the romantic
mind as a natural symbol of imaginative exuberance. If, on Corpus
Domini (cf. <I>S</I>, 1, 766), the world offers itself as a spectacle,
ritualistically spilling its theatrical vitality, Pound has missed the
right moment to watch, and what remains for him is the poppy spoil,
scattered testimony of such an expression of life. He yet lacks a
focus, he flippantly complains, probably to Browning: "(Can see whom
you will)." Pound then attempts to recreate such a contemplative moment
like Browning's, in which Pound's immediate surroundings would merge
with the world and work of a literary precursor. He tries Catullus,
"the civilized poet who still understood the psychological reality of
myths," and Arnaut Daniel (<I>GEPC</I>, 115). After a number of ostensibly
forced invocations, Pound distances himself from his effort, which he
apparently thinks falls short of authenticity. He sets out to recollect
"a younger self" (<I>GEPC</I>, 115)--the Pound of 1908 during <I>his</I>
first travels in Italy--and naturalistically elaborates on Browning's
own subversion of the romantic crafting of revelatory moments:

Pound intensifies Browning's moment of isolation here; the narrator is
sitting like a beggar on the curb, not on a step reminiscent of past
splendors. Pound's remembrance of visits past, moreover, is blurred by
distractions, such as thoughts of food ("I had my rolls for breakfast")
and sex ("she was young, too young"). He thus extends on Browning's
own parodic vision of the "race" as his "mistress," which alludes to the
Beatrice of the <I>Vita Nuova</I>, the half-eroticized, half-spiritualized
little girl whom a young Dante watched walking in the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Browning's "ruined palace step," the locus of his emergence from his
poem, is also carried further, even takes on a new life, in Pound's
composition. This monument of past regal ascents which Browning
conspicuously rhymes with "the everlasting steppe" of poetic aspiration
is a metaphor for marred hopes of earthly transcendence (see <I>S</I>,
3, 675-76). In Pound this image is first explicitly replaced
with the horizontal "Dogana's curb," but then finds its way back into
the text a few lines later in the form of the steps leading up into a
Japanese temple, and thus into a whole new realm of motifs suggesting
the interpenetration of spiritual, natural, and artistic realities.

In the opening of the eventual Canto 3, finally, Pound recalls sitting on
the "Dogana's step," as if ready to climb the flights of the merchants'
city's history, those beginnings of modern economic government that will
be thematized in much of <I>The Cantos</I>, and of which the Dogana is
a monument.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Canto 3 already contains elements of Pound's later attacks on what he
 summarily called "usura": he sits on the step because "gondolas cost too
 much that year," and in the following lines evokes contrasting images
 of palatial splendors, individual impoverishment, and institutionalized
 greed (<I>C</I>, 11). Pound's gradual translation of Browning's image
 thus illustrates thematic continuities between <I>Sordello</I>and
 <I>The Cantos</I>. They are both concerned with poetic power's losing
 battle with political power and the socio-economic deprivation politics
 effects. Browning's contemplations on the social, political, and moral
 role of the poet at the end of Book 3 look forward to the events of Book
 4 (leading, as echoes from Dante suggest, to the innermost circles of
 hell), where Sordello faces devastated Ferrara, its vexed population,
 and the Machiavellian Taurello Salinguerra. As it had in Book 2, the
 vicious circle of leaving isolation only to find himself more isolated
 closes once more for Sordello when he emerges from his meeting with
 Salinguerra, already crushed in spirit, only to find that the ravished
 populace celebrating him is barely able to tell him from Eglamor,
 and asks for nothing but light entertainment.
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It appears that there

<B></B>

cannot be poetic truth in what does not touch the lives of the
downtrodden, at the same time that the lives of the downtrodden are
generally closed to poetic truth. Throughout <I>The Cantos</I>, Pound
shares and develops Browning's respective visions of Dante's Paradise
as a utopia of poetic power and deepest Hell as a climate inescapably
hostile to such power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As it retraces the events of Book 4, <I>Sordello</I>'s Book 5
climactically dramatizes Sordello's battle with the politics of his
time. Now it is for most part Sordello who speaks directly, with his
awareness having gradually grown to a dimension comparable to the
author's. His reflections on his own past and the ephemeral nature of
his aspirations torture and rupture his intent with hesitations. His
very concern for self-expression, his Apollonian strife, he finds,
is feeble compared to Salinguerra's Bacchanalian power politics. In a
splendid moment, his monologue before Salinguerra in Palma's presence,
he climactically abdicates direct political responsibility and formulates
a matured, vitalist poetic whose first premise is the endeavor to overcome
the original limitations of self.

Browning describes his own poetics here. The salvational force is located
in literary tradition, the "deeds" of poetic thought, the survival and
progressive evolution of consciousness in art. Leaving it to posterity
"to unveil the last of mysteries," Sordello promises that he will
dramatize all of human experience he could possibly embrace, and that
he will disengage himself from his own creation, so that:

That Sordello should be the author of Browning's poem follows the logic
of the poetic just expressed--"Themselves before, the multitude turn you"
(<I>S</I>, 5, 536). As Sordello gives voice to the philosophy that guides
the writing of <I>Sordello</I>, he has taken the role of the creator--yet
this philosophy simultaneously leads to the abdication of any integrated
authorial presence. Thus, this climactic moment foreshadows the end
of the poem. Sordello's insights include the expectation--as it turns
out, an attitude of mind larger than he himself can bear--that his
own efforts are limited, that even his undone, transmuted self awaits
further undoing before it can be constructive. In the middle of his thus
"decompos[ing]" himself, Palma surprises him with the news, conferred
upon her at Adelaide's deathbed, that he in fact is Taurello's son. As
his rightful heir, Sordello is presented with the badge of Ghibelline
leadership, which, after Ecelin's retirement to a cloister, none of his
descendants seems fit to wear. The situation leaves Sordello in complete
disarray. Book 6 depicts the warfare of his multitudinous, conflicting
attitudes of mind, which finally turn in on his vital powers. He is
found dead with the badge at his feet, leaving leadership to Alberic
the tyrant, and thus Italy to further devastation. Sordello's forerunner
Eglamor's ghost haunts the conclusion of <I>Sordello</I> as a vision both
of the protagonist's own failure, the failure to live up to himself, to
match his thought in deed, and of the religious hope that there might be
spiritual progress after all, "spiral on spiral, gyres of life and light"
(<I>S</I>, 6, 804). Yet, the poem suggests, such progress certainly is
not linear and not easily measured in terms of individual human history;
"Sordello's chance was gone" for posterity (<I>S</I>, 6, 835).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Pound writes in <I>Three Cantos 1</I> that Browning "Watched the
'soul,' Sordello's soul, / And saw it lap up life, and swell and burst-- /
'Into the empyrean?,'" he comments not only on the dialectic dynamic of
hope and doubt, strife for transcendence and anticipation of annihilation,
that Browning's poem emplots to its last moment. Browning's version
of Sordello's life, the swelling and bursting of Sordello's soul, is
an existentialist account of the poet's designs to embody the world in
his poetry. The fact of death that explodes the meaning of individual
intent becomes a metaphor for the dispersion of the textualized authorial
self--Eglamor's, Sordello's, Browning's-- among all the texts that crowd
human history.

 It is this danger that, analogously to Browning's use of Dante's
 Sordello, Pound's earlier poem "Near Perigord" dramatized with Dante's
 stirrer-up-of-strife and fragmenter Bertrans de Born as its central
 re. Pound recognizes that in order to rewrite <I>Sordello</I>,
 he first of all needs to construct an answer to Browning's question:
 "Have ye times, places, actors of your own?" because in Browning those
 times, actors, and places function as part and parcel, material and
 structural devices, of his enterprise. Browning

reiterates and brings to life structural aspects of an original past
that highlight contemporary concerns of social and cultural transition
and renewal (<I>S</I>, 3, 937). Browning's post-Romantic experimentation
with the epic form involved choosing as a hero an eminent cultural and
political re from the transition between the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance. Browning then turns this re's career into that of a
poet-antihero. He creates a narrative that presents the individual poet's
struggle within the twilight of its time, with the light of the past
(antiquity) shining beyond the present darkness (of medieval turmoil):

Pound is afraid of being a "naif Ficinus," the fifteenth-century
Italian translator of Plato who drew on mythology the wrong way by
"creating a systematic allegory of already allegorized and unfeared gods"
(<I>GEPC</I>, 136). Recourse to history must not be stale and deadening,
but vitalizing, an example for the avant-garde. As Pound suggests in
both <I>Three Cantos 1</I> and <I>2</I>, the Renaissance as a stale
"<I>d&eacute;cor</I>" (<I>P</I>, 234) will not do, and his quest for
backgrounds leads him back to more vital origins. Pound here samples
various original historical backgrounds potentially available to him:
Egypt and its primitive power of art, Western and Biblical mythology
(the potential ineffectiveness of whose montage Ficinus had given an
example of) as they prere modern science, and ancient Asian cultures,
the contemplative dynamic of Chinese philosophy from the sixteenth
century B. C. onward, and the seductiveness of Japanese aesthetics and
religion, penetrating everyday life with "emblems of divine perception"
(<I>GEPC</I>, 138).
<SUP><A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The <I>Three Cantos</I> proceed to find ways to overlay all these diverse
 backgrounds "ply over ply"--a term describing both poetic technique and
 a certain perception of reality that Pound cites from <I>Sordello</I>
 (<I>S</I>, 5, 163) in <I>Three Cantos 2</I> (<I>P</I>, 236), and found
 poignant enough to insert again in the eventual Canto 4 and Canto 17
 (<I>C</I>, 15, 78).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound's layering of historical and literary texts and rhyming of
subjects and images, to borrow from Hugh Kenner's notion of Pound's
"subject-rhymes," is a method that, <I>in nuce</I>, <I>Sordello</I>
foreshadows both in its narrative technique and techniques of allusion.
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The path that Browning's image of the "ruined palace step" takes within
 the genesis of <I>The Cantos</I> is a good example of how Pound was
 inspired by Browning's clustering, juxtaposition, and rhyming of images
 and themes. Browning opens his poem to such poetic experimentation by
 more often than not disrupting the linearity of the narrative process
 and the unity of place and time for the sake of capturing the workings
 of consciousness, its flux through jarring states of mind. Browning
 presents, for instance, most of Sordello's life in an extended flashback
 that, in Book 1, allows him immediately to juxtapose the scenarios of
 Verona (and Ferrara, superimposed) and Goito, and the contrasting states
 of mind dramatized by them. For similar purposes he reworks structures of
 epic and sacred narrative, such as employed by Homer and Dante, and of
 medieval romance, particularly the structures of departure and return.
 Sordello takes off from Goito twice, pushes toward immersion in the
 "out-world" twice, and both his journeys bring him full circle, with all
 scenarios of the past ultimately being mentally present in <I>Sordello
 6</I>. In a similar vein, <I>Sordello 5</I> reiterates the events of
 <I>Sordello 4</I>, replacing temporal progress with a heightening of
 narrative awareness. In such ways Browning's narrative strategies,
 which at times even foreshadow twentieth-century film techniques,
 may have prepared Pound for negotiating those of Joyce.

It seems safe to agree with Gibson that, while Pound's materials
varied and sources of influence were numerous, principles of thought and
composition that crystallize in his dialogue with <I>Sordello</I> remained
vivid beyond <I>Three Cantos</I>. The allusions to Browning retained in
the final version of <I>The Cantos</I>, even if more condensed and covert

<B></B>

than in <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, are crucial, and the technique Pound
develops through his revisions structurally owes more than is acknowledged
to Browning's <I>Sordello</I>. The version of <I>Three Cantos</I>'s
opening apostrophe that survives as the beginning of Canto 2 suggests
that what Pound cut was an initial analysis and discussion no longer
necessary after he had found his own way of doing a <I>Sordello</I>:

The last line, taken from the first line of one of Sordello's <I>Vitae</I>
("Sordello was from Mantua"), poses an answer to the preceding
question. Browning found his way to Sordello through reading Dante, and
subsequently extended his research on twelfth- and thirteenth-century
culture and history to construct a new character. After penetrating
<I>Sordello</I>, Pound also will move further back, to origins, primary
texts, and documents, and assemble them with new authenticity, in his
own idiom.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Und &uuml;berhaupt ich stamm aus Browning. Pourquoi nier son
p&egrave;re," writes Pound to Ren&eacute; Taupin from Vienna in May 1928,
expounding his literary affiliations and ambitions.
<SUP><A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 This statement openly rejects anxiety of influence, belying, in German,
 the great Viennese school of Oedipal psychology with an untormented
 frankness very much in character for a poet whose critical writings
 point out writers held worthy to influence others, and whose own
 poetry explicitly relies on methods of imitation, intertextual
 commentary, pastiche, and translation, both in the literal and the
 widest senses. A close look at the German, however, reveals that Pound
 refers to his "father" not so much as a precursor self but as a place
 of origin; instead of "Ich stamme von Browning ab"--I am a descendant of
 Browning--he writes, "<I>Ich stamme aus Browning"</I>--I am <I>from</I>
 Browning, "ing" being a common ending of Germanic place names. This is
 surely not a slip on Pound's part. Anxiety of influence, one might argue,
 is "displaced" here in a peculiar sense of the word, as Browning becomes
 part of a geography--perhaps at the same time the ahistorical geography
 of extant texts and the nostalgic, historical geography of origin,
 departure, and return--rather than of a genealogy. Pound's poetic self,
 in turn, is thus constructed as geographical or textual, as divested of
 a fleshly or affective personality. Like Browning who emerges from and
 returns to the "lagune" of his poem, Pound, in re-working Browning's
 work, depicts himself as a disembodied consciousness arising from and
 shaping a literary landscape (<I>S</I>, 3, 607-15).

And so, toward the end of his life in Italy yet again, Pound types on
a single sheet of paper:

As in "Mesmerism," Pound's parody of Browning entails elements of
self-parody. In these lines, Pound uses details from Troubadour history
related to Browning's in <I>Sordello</I>, namely details from Bertrans
de Born's life and work. At the time, Pound himself drew heavily on this
background, most recently in "Near Perigord" (see below).

"swanzig," a comic spelling of German "zwanzig" (twenty), quibbles on
the peculiar sound of "Zanze," possibly Browning's rendering of "Zante,"
either the name of a Greek island or of a flower (as in Edgar Allan Poe's
"Sonnet to Zante" of 1837).

"Il miglior fabbro," Chap. 2 in <I>The Spirit of Romance</I> (New
York: New Directions, 1968), 22-38. Writing of the "trick" of the
"unfinished address," Pound may have had in mind a number of Daniel's
shorter poems (translations of which Pound first published in 1911 and
1912) that, like <I>Sordello</I>, open with a few lines in which the
poet addresses his audience on the topic of his art. See Ezra Pound,
<I>Ezra Pound: Translations</I> [New York: New Directions, 1970],
416-18, 420-25. Many of Pound's own short poems between 1913
and 1915 experiment with this device. The addresses could be considered
"unfinished," because they are not developed throughout the poem toward
a closure.

This vicious circle closes for the first time in Book 2, when Sordello's
first attempt at achieving a new aesthetic is marred by its intrinsic
difficulty. The fruit of Sordello's effort at Mantua betrays his labor,
"Because perceptions whole, like that he sought / To clothe, rejects so
pure a work of thought / As language," making his poetry so difficult
to comprehend that its deeper meanings completely escape his audience
(<I>S</I>, 2, 659; <I>S</I>, 2, 589--91). "Sundered in twain," the
aspiring poet-self split from the "Man," Sordello retires to Goito,
where "the stain / Of the world forsakes Sordello, with its pain / Its
pleasure," and in the very effort to heal himself--"Quiet those throbbing
temples, then subdue / That cheek's distortion"--he falls into depression
and passivity (<I>S</I>, 3, 15-17; <I>S</I>, 3, 5-8).

"rhyme" with the end of Canto 6, where, after juggling references to

notwithstanding his own difficulty in grasping <I>Sordello</I>, Pound
cited it as an example of "narrative limpidity" and poetic ease (Pound,
<I>The ABC of Reading</I>, 188-91). Whereas "Victorian half-wits
claimed this poem was obscure," he maintains that Browning's verse was
"without clog and verbal impediment." To prove this he chooses passages
that are relatively easy to follow. Evidently he is out to shatter
prejudice against Browning--but perhaps also against the difficult idiom
he had developed out of his engagement with Browning's.

 "The necessary condition for an image is sight," Gustav Janouch claims to
 have said to Kafka. Kafka supposedly smiled and replied: "We photograph
 things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way
 of shutting my eyes."
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Photography as exorcism is performed in order to drive things out
 of our minds. In a typical paradox, Kafka transforms the photograph
 from a vehicle of remembrance, a monument to a thing or moment in
 the external world, into a means of expelling a "thing"--a place, a
 person, a demon?--from the mind itself. Given material expression in
 the photograph, the image is separable, detachable not only from its
 referent but, as Kafka is supposed to have put it, from the "mind." In
 Kafka's formulation as transmitted by Janouch, stories are "a way,"
 a means of shutting the eyes, of not looking at what we do not wish
 to see. But this paradox ensures that the link between photographs and
 works of fiction remains ambiguous. On the one hand, stories are seen in
 contradistinction to photography--not as a means of exorcising demons,
 but rather as a means of shutting them out, of erecting a textual barrier
 between self and world. On the other hand, it is the relatedness of
 story to photograph that is intriguing, the sense in which writing too,
 may be an exorcism. "Shutting the eyes," as an act entailed in writing,
 would render narrative an effort both to expel and shut out the images
 that photography fixes. In this reading, narrative is complicit with
 photography in its attempt to keep the "things" that haunt us at a
 distance. But is sight really the "necessary condition for the image,"
 as Janouch postulates? Surely it is also suggested that some images
 exist in the mind's eye alone.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What, then, might keeping one's <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> imply? The title
of Kubrick's last film almost certainly refers to this exchange between
Kafka and Janouch, albeit indirectly.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Adopting Kafka's tendency to speak in paradoxes, Kubrick shrouds the
 relations between photograph and narrative in further ambiguity. Where
 to look for enlightenment? Quoting Kafka and Janouch in <I>Camera
 Lucida</I>, his meditation on photography, Roland Barthes muses that
 the best way to look at photographs may be to look away, to <I>close</I>
 one's eyes. "Absolute subjectivity," writes Barthes, "is achieved only
 in a state, an effort, of silence. Shutting your eyes is to make the
 image speak in silence . . . to say nothing, to shut my eyes, to allow
 the detail to rise of its own accord into affective consciousness"
 (<I>CL</I>, 55). The detail to which Barthes refers is of a particular
 kind: it is what he calls the <I>punctum</I>, an element which "shoots
 out of [the scene] like an arrow and pierces me" (<I>CL</I>, 26). The
 marks or wounds created by the <I>punctum</I> generate affective
 responses: "a photograph's <I>punctum</I> is that accident which pricks
 me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)" (<I>CL</I>, 27); it is
 that which "attracts and distresses"(<I>CL</I>, 40).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With reference to Barthes's reflections, then, keeping the "eyes wide
shut" refers to the insight that comes from sustained meditation on the
image that a photograph leaves in the mind's eye. It is when all else is
excluded--what Barthes calls the "noise" that surrounds the image--that
the significant detail, the wounding <I>punctum</I>, brings insight in the
form of affective response. Barthes, then, takes Kafka's words literally,
applying them to the photograph rather than to the story. "Shutting his
eyes," Barthes <I>restores</I> the image of the exorcised "thing" to the
mind. Reconnecting with the wounding "thing" and viewing it in the mind's
eye once more, Barthes savors those affects that Kafka prefers to keep
at bay. Could it be that <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>--a film whose title was
chosen by Kubrick, remaining enigmatic to his screenwriter--contains a
<I>punctum</I>, something that attracts and distresses Kubrick? Something
once exorcised--only to be internalized and viewed with "eyes wide shut"
after all? What is it that attracts and distresses? What is it that
produces affects, both pleasurable and unpleasurable?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kubrick's films reveal a fixation with the writers and artists of the
Hapsburg monarchy; the "Blue Danube Waltz" and Strauss's "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" only momentarily seem out of place in the aural texture of
<I>2001</I>. In interviews, Kubrick in particular invokes the names of
the late Austrian monarchy's Jewish writers and intellectuals--of Kafka,
Stefan Zweig, Arthur Schnitzler, and Freud.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The Stefan Zweig story "The Burning Secret" ("Brennendes Geheimnis"),
 that took Kubrick's fancy was never made into a film, but the adaptation
 of Schnitzler's <I>Traumnovelle</I> intrigued Kubrick for decades
 before its realization (<I>KUB</I>, 154, 156). Frederic Raphael,
 screenwriter for <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>, was given books of paintings
 by Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, and asked to study Freud (<I>EWO</I>,
 112). Years before, collaborating on a screenplay for <I>The Shining</I>,
 Kubrick and Diane Johnson read Freud's essay on "The Uncanny" together,
 and Kafka was also on Kubrick's mind.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 How intriguing, then, that in an essay written years before the
 release of <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>, Michel Ciment suggests that Kubrick's
 "unfulfilled ambition" of filming the Schnitzler text may have "found
 an outlet" in <I>The Shining</I> (<I>KUB</I>, 144). As this essay will
 claim, the points of connection between <I>The Shining</I> and <I>Eyes
 Wide Shut</I> are mediated by the presence of Kafka.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Kafka's writing, at once so allegorical and yet, as Kubrick put it,
"simple and straightforward, almost journalistic" in style, Kubrick
thought he had found the "perfect guide" for a "realistic approach"
(<I>KUB</I>, 186). Critics who have sought the "missing auteur" in
Kubrick's work might look to the extreme anonymity of Kafka's narrative
technique--to what Kubrick refers to as Kafka's "journalistic" style--as
a model for what is read as the filmmaker's authorial "absence"("TDA,"
301). If Kubrick is said to have "eviscerated the affective surfaces" of
more than one novel ("TDA," 291), it is equally claimed of Kafka that he
"affectively neutralizes" what his stories are at pains to represent.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 But oddly, perhaps, it is two minor scenes in <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> that
 most obviously cue Kafkaesque concerns in Kubrick. It is Schnitzler's
 <I>Traumnovelle</I> that contains the scenes to which I am referring--the
 scenes in the costume shop--but readers of Kafka will agree that these
 scenes might well have come straight out of <I>The Trial</I>. In both
 their fictional and filmic versions, they play themselves out against
 the background of sexual antics performed by a young girl with two men
 in wigs--antics that take place behind and under furniture and have both
 the offhand and yet grotesque effect of similar couplings in Kafka's
 fiction. For Kubrick, I will suggest, the Kafkaesque overtones of these
 scenes in Schnitzler's novella constitute what Barthes's <I>punctum</I>
 is to the photograph: that which "pricks me, bruises me, is poignant
 to me."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A meditation on the nature of the still image lingers even in the midst
of Kubrick's most kinetic films, not surprising in a filmmaker who began
his career as a photographer.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Kubrick's concentration on the still image is the natural counterpart
 to his fascination with cinematic movement; we find it in the thousands
 of pre-production photographs in which most of Kubrick's films have
 their visual origins and we find it variously expressed in the films
 themselves. It appears, for example, in <I>Barry Lyndon</I>, the most
 painterly of Kubrick's films, usually in the rendering of painting. It
 is present in the compositions taken from Gainsborough and Hogarth, and
 in the homage to Reynolds that occurs in the static shots especially
 of the Lyndon residence, in reality the picturesque Castle Howard. We
 also find it in the careful composition of each frame, in the manner
 in which movement itself becomes an "actor" in some frames, often
 beginning in the middle of an otherwise still frame, and then gradually
 subsuming the frame from within, in the manner of F. W. Murnau. Kubrick's
 interest in the still image as the basis and foil for cinematic motion
 is evident even in <I>2001</I>. Although the film is "a formal statement
 on the nature of movement", as Annette Michelson has pointed out, the
 orchestrated and abstract nature of this movement admits its reliance
 on the still image--hence our sense, as Michelson puts it, that we are
 viewing another <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 We find the still image likewise in the transparencies used for the
 "Dawn of Man" prologue in <I>2001</I>: they are "picture postcards" that
 provide sublime backdrops for these scenes, but they also endow each
 of them with something of the photograph's atemporality, its "moment of
 time" feel in a series of incomprehensibly distant moments of the past.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>The Shining</I> , the static image as photograph does much
to evoke the uncanny and the supernatural. Perhaps Kubrick himself had
the intuition expressed by Kracauer that the photographic rendering of
human bodies produces portraits of ghosts and ghostly images.
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Or perhaps it was Barthes's assertion in <I>Camera Lucida</I>, that the
 <I>eidos</I> of the photograph is death, which suggested the particular
 possibilities of still photography for rendering the supernatural to
 Kubrick (<I>CL</I>, 15). Certainly Freud's work on "The Uncanny" ("Das
 Unheimliche", 1919) would have triggered an interest in the effects
 that mechanically-rendered motion can have on the spectator, reminding
 Kubrick of early film's preoccupation with its capacity to set images of
 the human body in motion, to efface the divisions between life and death.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Or it may in fact have been Kafka's suggestion to Janouch, mediated by
 Barthes, that photography is a kind of exorcism. Whatever the source,
 <I>The Shining</I> is haunted by photography: photography itself
 resurfaces as an aspect of the film's imaginary, as a return of the
 repressed--or, as Barthes puts it, a "return of the dead" (<I>CL</I>, 9).
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most intriguing, perhaps, is the almost maniacal, willed insistence on
photographic indexicality that persists in film's relation to photography
in Kubrick: it is here that the body enters film. Photographs in <I>The
Shining</I> become "material." Jack's "visions" or mental projections--his
experiences with the dead--take their subjects both from newspaper photos
and from the myriad black and white photographs that adorn the walls
of the Overlook Hotel. These images take on lush colors as Jack brings
their dead imaginatively to life, as he "realizes" the photographs and
enters their spaces, interacting with the ghosts who populate them.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Jack has a "visionary" power that resides in the capacity to animate
 photographs from the past, to animate them narratively in the manner of
 cinema. But of greatest importance to this essay is the film's insistence
 on the (red) materiality of these images, on the manner in which
 they evoke the body. In one of his "visions," Jack "recognizes" the
 former caretaker from his photograph in the newspaper and, as Fredric
 Jameson puts it, "the film public palpably gasps when the conventions
 of the ghost story are violated, when the hero physically intersects
 with his fantasmagoric surrounding and he collides with the <I>material
 body of a waiter</I> whose drink he spills" (emphasis mine).
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Another case in point is the allusion to <I>Faust I</I> as Jack sits
 down at the ballroom bar: "I'd give my goddamned soul for a glass of
 beer," he announces. A moment later, his own reflection in the mirror
 is replaced by the image of the bartender, a devil clothed in red. Just
 as Goethe's Mephisto plays to the students' bodily desires by conjuring
 up an image of wine real enough to guzzle down, the bartender produces
 a drink for the "parched" Jack in an atmosphere that similarly insists
 upon the materiality of illusion.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Drinks are spilled and consumed, music listened and danced to, lust
 is aroused, disgust produced. The horror film, as Linda Williams has
 famously said, is one of the "body genres."
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Here, the ghost materializes and is revealed to have a body; Kubrick's
 uncanny is decidedly corporeal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using language that suggests the indexical relation of the photograph
to the real, Mr. Halloran tells Jack's son Danny that the violent events
perpetrated in the hotel have left "their trace." The photographic nature
of certain images will be evoked visually several times later on in the
film, each time juxtaposing the photograph's "flat

<B></B>

Death" (<I>CL</I>, 92) and an uncanny materiality. One notable
incidence occurs in the "Thursday" scene, when the film camera moves
in on Jack's crazed face with its motionless grimace--an image that
is a freeze frame--until Jack arches his eyebrows diabolically. This
moment of controlled movement exemplifies the possibilities both
of arresting action, and of killing off the moving, hence seemingly
three-dimensional image into the photograph--and then bringing it to life
by the introduction of movement once again. The macabre "frozen" moment
and arrested action of the photograph are suggested in the ice sculpture
that Jack's body--very much a material image--will become. How fitting,
then, that the film camera, moving ever closer, will discover Jack at
the center of the group photo of Overlook guests at a 1921 ball. Now
himself a ghost, Jack has been exorcised into the space of photography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like father, like son. Danny's visions also have a photographic dimension:
the first one features the oceanic, silent eruption of blood out of the
elevator, with the two Grady girls not yet part of the scene. Instead,
the image of the elevator is cut with a very briefly-held still
of the two murdered girls: their frontality and the directness with
which they look out of the frame suggest a family snapshot, while their
near-doubling--they are not twins--seems to allude to subjects in similar
compositions by American photographer Diane Arbus. Later, Danny will turn
around to see the Grady girls behind him as he is playing darts. Although
they have now "materialized"--become more filmic and entered the space
of the narrative--they continue to assume a frontal pose. Even as they
turn around they hold hands and maintain their "frontal" conration:
they are silent images only partially released from a photograph. In the
"Tuesday" scene, the Grady sisters will appear to Danny again as res
in a photograph, but in the "Thursday" sequence he will come upon them at
the end of a corridor, and this time they will speak to him--in tandem,
and in the formulaic language of fairytales. Terrified by these images,
Danny recalls what Mr. Halloran had told him--that the images he sees are
"just like pictures in a book."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of Annette Michelson's assertions concerning <I>200l</I>--that
it dissolves the opposition between body and mind, that "things seen"
are supplemented by "things felt," and the camera has a great deal to do
with both--hold true for <I>The Shining</I> as well ("BIS," 60). There the
film camera is a "presence" from its first frames, of course, when its
eccentric trajectory seems to stalk, then lose interest in, the family
in the VW below. Swooping over a cliff rather than keeping its prey in
focus, the camera emerges as a character rather than as an embodiment of
authorial presence--unlike the camera in a Hitchcock film, for instance,
it is less voyeuristic than predatory. The familiar <I>dies irae</I>
melody with which the film begins conjures up Carl Theodor Dreyer's
<I>Day of Wrath</I> (1943; also known as <I>Vredens Dag</I>), reinforcing
a connection with the earlier film in its use of a mobile camera.
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Here, as in <I>Day of Wrath</I>, the camera seems to have the evil eye as
 well as the witch's power of invocation, the power to call up "the Quick
 and the Dead." Its sinister playfulness is continued in many interior
 shots of the hotel, where, rather than keeping the Torrances in frame,
 the camera often disappears behind pillars, only to bring them into
 focus once more as it wends its sinuous way along confining corridors.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My point here is simply that the film camera does not play to the eye
alone. During long takes the steadicam tends to track rapidly backwards,
retreating in front of the characters who are moving towards us,
thus doubling the effect of speed and motion, and producing spectator
vertigo. While the camera is rarely alligned with Jack, and prefers to
shoot characters frontally, it is often located behind Danny--sometimes
seeming to share his point of view, sometimes in pursuit--most notably
during the dizzying sequences when he is on his tricycle.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In <I>The Shining</I>, the affective response missing from the film's
 unlocalizable narrative voice is displaced into the spectator, in whom
 camera movement and imagery produce sensations of vertigo and nausea.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Kubrick ensures that his spectator is embodied.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At times the film camera crosses to the other side. Moving "through the
looking glass," it may playfully juxtapose the uncanny mirror image with
the (diegetic) real, as in the crucial sequence titled "A Month Later,"
when Wendy brings Jack breakfast in bed.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In our first view of Jack, the camera pulls back from a frontal shot,
 only gradually revealing that what we see is his reflection in the
 mirror. Next the "real" Wendy enters the frame, and then the camera moves
 back into the space of the mirror. There follows a shot of Wendy from
 Jack's point of view that emerges from an "impossible" place--out of the
 mirror itself, another Dreyer moment, recalling the impossible point of
 view of the corpse in <I>Vampyr</I> (1932; also known as <I>Vampyr--Der
 Traum des Allan Grey</I>). The mirror will likewise be the site of the
 uncanny when Jack enters Room 237. A shot of Jack shows him in happy
 anticipation as a young and beautiful woman approaches him. But as
 he embraces her, he glances into the mirror in which their bodies are
 reflected. As the woman's body visibly ages, disintegrates, and decays
 in the mirror, telescoping time, we hear the cackle of a witch. Once
 again illusion asserts its connection to corporeality, a corporeality
 that corrupts the image from within. The witch as temptress and hag
 recalls <I>Day of Wrath</I>. But the image in the mirror--a trope of
 the supernatural--more importantly points to the abject maternal body,
 alive and dead, equally the object of desire and horror.

Citing Freud as his source, Winfried Menninghaus reminds us that
fairytales can represent uncanny situations and occurrences without
bringing them fully into affective consciousness. Just so, Kafka's stories
have the ability, as Menninghaus puts it, "to render virtually invisible
and affectively neutral what his fictions are continuously at pains to
represent: disgusting bodies, gestures, and actions."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Eating and sex, two canonical acts of the grotesque, are closely
 associated in Kafka, and carnality--both in its sexual and gustatory
 forms, approaching even cannibalism--evokes strong affective responses
 in the male characters who populate his texts. Similarly--the
 Deleuzian insistence on Kubrick's cinema as a "cinema of the brain"
 notwithstanding--critical response to <I>The Shining</I> has noted
 its corporeal concerns, variously connecting the Overlook Hotel with
 the womb, its labyrinth with the intestines, and pointing out that its
 dominant color is blood red.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 As in Kafka's texts, disgust and nausea are often

<B></B>

linked in the genre of the horror film to a complex relation to the
female body.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But even beyond this clich&eacute;d common concern, the nature of
 Kubrick's obsession with the female body points to an unexpected
 dimension of Kafka's significance for his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It's all very homey," says Jack Torrance when he first surveys
the cavernous spaces of the Overlook Hotel; "homey" in the sense of
comfortable, <I>gem&uuml;tlich</I>, is precisely what the Overlook is
not. A month later, when Jack claims to have fallen in love with the hotel
right away, to have felt as though he "had been there before", as though
he "knew what was going to be behind every corner," we know what his
remarks are intended to suggest. "Homey" in this context means canny, and
as Ciment reminds us with Freud, a sense of <I>d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu</I>
suggests that the familiar place has been connected with the maternal body
(<I>KUB</I>, 144). Further, in his visions, Jack's son Danny repeatedly
sees "torrents" (Torrance?) of blood pouring out of an elevator. Blood
is first seen seeping out from behind the doors, then gushing forth
(the cinematic allusion here is to Fritz Lang's <I>Metropolis</I> of
1927), and the narrative overtly connects this blood with a paternal
violence against children that transgresses our most rigid taboos. But
visually, this scene accomplishes something else: by suggesting that
the corridors of the hotel are corporeal passageways--arteries for the
transport of blood--it turns the hotel itself into a body. What is more
"homey"--<I>heimlich</I>, canny--than the body of the mother? And yet this
scene is violent: the gushing of blood surrounds the deaths of children,
as though to suggest a perverse inversion of the nourishing placenta.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, as in Kafka, perversion and disgust infiltrate the domain
of nourishment and eating from this film's beginning, when a
conversation about the snowbound Donner party cues the theme of
cannibalism. Foreshadowing the desperate circumstances of the snowbound
Torrances, this theme persists during the tour of the meat freezer,
and we feel relief that Danny, when asked which meat is his favorite,
replies "French fries and ketchup." The suggestion of cannibalism
infects the act of eating so profoundly that it comes into play even
as the sympathetic African-American chef, Mr. Halloran, serves Danny
chocolate ice-cream, and we might add that his father Jack's preferred
drink is Jack Daniels. Cannibalism resides in the domain of Kristeva's
abject, a prime example of the "crossing over of the categories of Pure
and Impure," a perversion of the infantile desire for incorporation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Danny experiences nausea as well as terror at the images of his bloody
visions, his reactions only serve to make the connections between the
digestive and the uterine domains more fluid. And then there is Tony,
Danny's imaginary friend and double, the "author" of his visions, who
lives, as Danny puts it, in his "mouth" and in his "stomach." In keeping
with Otto Rank's insights concerning the double, Danny gives birth to Tony
in order to ward off death, in turn keeping Tony "safe" in his "stomach,"
as he puts it, his metaphorical womb. From the child's point of view,
Tony--both a voice who speaks through Danny, and the "source" of Danny's
ghastly visions--inhabits his body rather than his mind. Thus Danny's
visionary power--"shining"--is by its very location identified with the
"desirable and terrifying, nourishing and murderous, fascinating and
abject inside of the maternal body" (<I>POH</I>, 55). Danny's visions
both re and produce substances--blood and vomit--that Kristeva
relegates to the domain of the

<B></B>

mother, the domain of the body. From what source, we may well ask, does
the heartbeat that makes its way into so many of Kubrick's soundtracks
emanate? And why does the color red tend to dominate the visual field?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The maternal body itself is abject, and we must break with it through
the power of language (<I>POH</I>, 13). Small wonder, then, that Jack
Torrance, would-be writer, imprisoned within the maternal body that
is the Overlook Hotel, has a disturbed relation to the symbolic. Jack
comes to the hotel armed with an album into which he has carefully pasted
newspaper clippings--both photographs and stories--intending to use these
as a basis for his novel. But Jack cannot write, he can only type; he and
his typewriter have become a mechanical writing machine. In the manner of
concrete poetry, Jack uses language as though it were a non-signifying
material, creating a series of typographical variations on a single
sentence--a sentence not even of his own devising. Page after page piles
up, producing a modernist that is a material object, a sculpture--a text
whose relation to temporality is distorted in favor of the image.

In Schnitzler's <I>Traumnovelle</I>, the two men engaged in sex with

robes of this office.
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The judges are seated at a table from under which the young girl slithers
 to escape her approaching father. In this first scene at the costume
 shop, the father admonishes the girl and chastises the judges who, as
 they leave the shop in evening clothes, are revealed to have been in
 costume--not judges at all. The next day, when the hero of Schnitzler's
 story returns to find one of them leaving the young girl's room,
 the father will reveal himself to have been in complicity with their
 behavior: it had never been his intention to have recourse to the law
 at all. Indeed, the father is his daughter's pimp. Schnitzler's scene
 is a scene out of Kafka.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kubrick's <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> both masks and intensifies this
connection. The daughter's lovers do not even pose as judges: Kubrick's
modern-day New York version of this scene transforms the costumed
"judges" into Japanese tourists in wigs; one of them is wearing red
bikini briefs, and the other emerges naked from behind the sofa where he
has presumably been having sex with the young girl. In Kubrick's film,
the costume shop owner is a man named Milich who speaks in a heavy
accent that permeates the scene with a Middle-European atmosphere. The
bathrobe that Milich wears is worn by Schnitzler's shop owner as well,
a sign of the not-quite-respectable nearness of the body that evokes
memories of many Kafka texts. Further, the film introduces a Kafkaesque
"gatekeeper" aspect into the initial encounter between Bill Harford,
the protagonist, and Milich: Harford bargains with Milich for access
to his shop at an actual wrought-iron gate, while Milich--jangling his
keys--claims "one can't be too careful." Milich, we might add, is played
by Rade Scherbedgia, an actor who resembles Kubrick himself, suggesting
that a personal concern may inform the costume shop sequences.

Let us return now to Schnitzler's young men dressed as Vehmic court

a Law which is itself contaminated by their acts. Nevertheless, the
Law is not cleansed of its contamination when the men are revealed as

 "vital promiscuity" of the workers' lodgings, it is a sexually-enticing
 washerwoman who allows K. entry into the interrogation chamber and, as
 K. stands before the tribunal, he dimly sees a man and woman locked
 in an embrace (<I>LA</I>, 147). Zizek puts it thus:
 "Smeared by an obscene vitality, the law itself--traditionally a
 pure, neutral universality--assumes the features of a heterogeneous,
 inconsistent <I>bricolage</I> penetrated with enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>,
 149). Zizek reads Kafka's reaction to the separation of
 these domains as a sign of his embeddedness in Jewish culture: the Jewish
 religion, claims Zizek, "marks the moment of the most radical
 separation of these domains. In all previous religions, we encounter a
 place, a domain of sacred enjoyment (<I>in the form of ritual orgies,
 for example</I>), whereas in Judaism the sacred domain is evacuated
 of all traces of vitality and the living substance is subordinated
 to the dead letter of the Father's law" (<I>LA</I>, 150; emphasis
 mine). Reacting against this separation, writes Zizek,
 "Kafka trespasses the divisions of his inherited religion, flooding
 the judicial domain, once again, with enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>, 150).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is as though <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> had been made with this quotation
from Zizek in mind. Kubrick's elaboration of the ritual orgy
in his film culminates in the moment when its participants take on the
role of judges as Bill Harford stands before them in the crimson circle,
unmasked and brought to judgment. In Schnitzler's story, the mock judges
who participate in the orgy with the shopkeeper's daughter anticipate
this moment, of course.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Although Kubrick has disguised Schnitzler's mock-judges as businessmen,
 he nevertheless retains the theme of the permeability of the judicial
 to the vital domain that he reads in Kafka, transposing it to the
 scene of a ritual orgy enacted by powerful men participating in a
 quasi-religious rite.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It remains to suggest in what sense Kafka's merging of these domains
might consitute a <I>punctum</I> for Kubrick. What, for Kubrick, might
the implication of "flooding the

<B></B>

judicial domain with enjoyment" be? If, as Zizek contends, in
Judaism "the living substance is subordinated to the dead letter of the
Father's law," then Kafka presents the reader with the counter-example
of a textuality which is anything but dead--yet whose sensuality is
masked by the glossy surface of a distanced, opaque, <I>modernist</I>
style. It is a style of "proverbial purity," whose effect on the reader,
as Zizek sees it, may be otherwise: "It is as if," he writes,
"Kafka's text were a coagulated, stigmatized, signifying chain repelling
signification with an excess of sticky enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>, 151). The
"stickiness" of this text is that of unmentionable bodily substances--of
the body of the sexual woman, of Kristeva's abject mother, and of the
Bakhtinian grotesque who ingests, excretes, and fornicates.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In any art form, Annette Michelson has said with reference to Kubrick's
<I>2001</I>, the perception of "lived reality" is not easily compatible
with the "movement towards abstraction which animates the style and
esthetics of modernism" ("BIS," 58). As we have noted, Jack Torrance's
typewriter is a machine that can only produce mechanical writing on
stacks of paper, while in his <I>Penal Colony</I>, Kafka notoriously
offers his reader a writing machine that inscribes human flesh. This
bleeding script points to modernism's Other, its counterpart and
complement. It is the vital domain itself--the stuff of representation
becomes its surface--reversing the relation between the photograph
and its inscription of the body as trace. What Kubrick sees in Kafka's
stories is a relation between style and content that is antithetical in
the extreme. If, as Kafka puts it, his stories are a way of "shutting
his eyes," Kafka may also be referring to the manner in which his "pure"
style acts as a kind of sealant, covering over--even entrapping--his
subject under a veneer that represses it, contains it, and gives it an
auratic glow. To have one's eyes "wide shut," then, is, like Kubrick,
to be aware of Kafka's project--and to imitate it.

Indiscriminately combining the different temporal moments of the
photographs--Grady's stewardship of the Overlook in the 1970s is
merged with the 1920s in which the hotel flourished--Jack's visions
de-emphasize temporality in favor of the space of their setting,
the hotel. But it is not "nostalgia" for the past--for <I>which</I>
past, we might well ask--that animates Kubrick to bring them to life,
as Fredric Jameson has suggested (see Fredric Jameson, "Historicism in
<I>The Shining</I>," in <I>Signatures of the Visible</I> [New York:

as they conflate and subvert their several temporalities by introducing
narrative--or cinematic time--into their frames.

1. Godard's Trauerspiel of Cinema
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In recent years, several screen adaptations of Proust's <I>&Agrave;
la recherche du temps perdu</I> have been produced in defiance of the
legendary difficulty of an enterprise that discouraged earlier directors
such as Luchino Visconti and Joseph Losey.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 In 1999, Raoul Ruiz completed <I>Le temps retrouv&eacute;</I> and, in
 2000, Chantal Akerman's <I>La captive</I> enriched the growing Proustian
 filmography. Whereas Akerman successfully adapts just one section of the
 <I>Recherche</I>, Ruiz's movie more ambitiously dramatizes the entire
 last volume, thus attempting a synoptic recapitulation of the entire
 oeuvre. To make an adaptation of the <I>Recherche</I> may look like an
 act of hubris, yet, as Walter Benjamin remarks apropos of an imagined
 film production of Goethe's <I>Faust</I>, "the indestructibility of
 the highest life in all things" compels critical intelligence to regard
 the quality, rather than the principle, of a work.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Ruiz's effort shows many clever intuitions, such as its canny
usage of superimposition to represent the intricate effects of involuntary
memory, his film, in the final analysis, fails to convince. The reason
for his failure has less to do with the <I>a priori</I> impossibility of
filming the <I>Recherche</I> than with a literal-minded fidelity to his
narrative model and a concern for <I>d&eacute;cor d'&eacute;poque</I>,
concern which unfortunately conveys the impression of a Merchant-Ivory
period piece, or perhaps a minor Visconti costume drama. Moreover, the
Chilean director's insistence on a surrealist manipulation of the image
within a single frame (for example the scenes carpeted with upturned
hats or populated

<B></B>

by mutiple Marcels) rather than on the organizing work of montage
mistakenly results in an adaptation that reduces the <I>Recherche</I>--a
novel whose very title suggests an operation of some epistemological
importance--to a trivial dramaturgical puzzle. A better translation
of the novel into the cinematic idiom would aim at a more ral or
"involuntary" relation to the original, a reinterpretation through
which the very temporal ground of interpretation would reveal itself
allegorically.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Along these lines, a work that ought to be regarded as an "involuntary"
adaptation of <I>La recherche</I> is Jean-Luc Godard's <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I>. The four-hour film, released simultaneously in
France with a four-volume book interweaving text and stills, ambitiously
attempts to reconstruct twentieth-century history and the very development
of the movies through a collage of film traces. Godard worked upon this
singular enterprise over a span of ten years from 1988 to 1998, and it
at once constitutes a sort of archeology of the medium film and an act
of recalling the twentieth century.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The result is a work divided into eight segments or, as Godard puts
 it, "constellations," bearing such evocative titles as "Toutes les
 histoires," "Une histoire seule," "Seul le cin&eacute;ma," "Fatale
 beaut&eacute;," "La monnaie de l'absolu," "Une vague nouvelle," "Le
 contr&ocirc;le de l'univers," "Les signes parmi nous" (<I>ACMS</I>,
 9). The different units vary in length and bear an often inorganic
 relationship to the central idea of the film. The titles and subtitles
 reappear as if refrains in a litany.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The final work consists of a dense montage of fragmentary movie sequences
 which is punctuated by the superimposition of flashing text, color
 schemes, paintings, and readings of literary works. Playing the role
 of Virgil, Godard guides us on our meandering way through an inferno
 of images while commenting in voice-over on the past as if from beyond
 the grave.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Melancholic in tone, Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I> ought to be understood
as a highly subjective response to the increasing obsolescence of a
certain idea of cinema, call it "art cinema," the cinema of montage
and mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Although computerized cinematography may
in some sense represent the future of the form, it is evident that
the digital image, as distinct from its celluloid variant, enacts a
temporality of the perpetual present tense. Indeed, in so far as the
digital image is removed from any ontological grounding or referent,
it may even be regarded as a photograph that is atemporal in nature,
without temporality. What the camera produces is no longer necessarily a
historical record, because digital techniques enable the creation of the
image ex nihilo. Although the flexibility of the new technology opens a
space for a certain type of creative experimentation, its divorce from
historical reality deprives film of its function as a mode of memory,
and hence as a framework for critical inquiry. In this light, Godard's
search for lost cinema represents a potential corrective to indiscriminate
acceptance of the status quo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Implicit throughout this search is the recognition that film has furnished
the twentieth century with new resources of memory, chief of which are the
reorganizing procedures of montage. Montage defines the peculiar manner
in which we remember movies, the mode in which consciousness incorporates
the fragmentary, involuntary, and defamiliarizing experience of time. Yet
as powerfully as Godard's m&eacute;lange of film quotes affirms the idea
of cinema as an artistic means of access to the past, it also mourns
this untimely and imperiled notion. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
thus performs an

<B></B>

especially pointed, if allegorized, reinterpretation of <I>&Agrave;
la recherche du temps perdu</I>. Speculating on the fate of a medium
that seems about to disappear before the completion of its perceived
end, Godard draws a parallel between the task of cinema and that of the
narrator at the end of Proust's opus.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Appropriately, the most daring of film editors has achieved the most
Proustian of films. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> recounts the
camera's pursuit of what the film alternately calls a "monde perdu"
and a "temps perdu."
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The very "mati&egrave;re et m&eacute;moire" of Godard's history thus
 derive from Proust's <I>Recherche</I>. If, early in his career, the
 director's bold experiments helped establish the "amnesic" style of
 the New Wave, they now permit him to rehabilitate the tatters of our
 past. In <I>Histoire(s)</I> Godard is intent on rescuing past images from
 banality and on restoring their strangeness by refusing to supply the
 narrative context from which they are taken, as Alain Bergala points out:
 "Godard systematically refuses the present of the shots he shows us. He
 recuperates these shots from the past and if he tries to resuscitate
 them, it is by trying to allow them to return in a different way,
 disconnected from the script within which they were caught."
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's approach renounces the "objective" logic of collective
history and memory in favor of the subjective contingency of Proustian
<I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>. His quest for a lost cinematic
paradise, however, is motivated by an ambition that exceeds the strictly
"autobiographical." Godard strives to express the physiognomy of the
twentieth century through its remains. In this sense, if his aesthetic
inspiration is mainly Proustian, his ideology and methodology betray a
close proximity to Benjamin's last works, <I>The Arcades Project</I> and
the "Theses on the Philosophy of History." Indeed, as I will argue, it is
by developing a cinematic language capable of encompassing the Benjaminian
antipodes of materialist critique and messianic hope that Godard
ultimately arrives at a truly Proustian relation to the past, at a model
of remembrance that is neither mechanical nor nostalgic. <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I> imagines the resurrection of history through the
recuperation of an idea of film that has been eradicated by the ascendancy
of mass entertainment, a recovery that can only be accomplished in a
Proustian spirit of receptivity to the involuntary.

2. Cinematic Proust
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If memory is the broad, manifest theme of <I>Histoire(s)</I>, Godard in
particular wants to show how cinema alters our very conception of memory,
transforming it from the faculty of willed recall into a ghostly element
of involuntary reminiscences. On this score, he demonstrates to what
extent the medium film possesses a Proustian aspect: movies return to
haunt us according to the logic of the involuntary. Indeed, he argues
cogently that our memory of film consists of the emotional shape of
certain images, not their phenomenological content.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This position dovetails neatly with a view held by the French philosopher
Deleuze. He believes that, had Proust lived longer, he would have written
in cinematic terms; but he also regards him as the proper originator of
the most complicated of film theories, that of the time-image.

Godard enlarges upon Deleuze's intuition to compose a history of
cinema that enacts the rhythm of the time-image, instead of adopting a
conventionally chronological approach. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
thus pertinently reframes the question of the relationship between
Proust's novel and cinematic memory. While many critics, from Brassa&iuml;
to Mieke Bal, agree that there is a photographic logic at work in the
<I>Recherche</I>, the cinematic subtext of the novel is more rarely and
obliquely considered by readers (Deleuze and Benjamin being the only
two critics who readily come to mind).
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 As will be contended, however, the language of the novel powerfully
 deploys a range of cinematic techniques from montage to superimposition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did Proust ever go to the movies? According to his latest biographer,
William C. Carter, the answer is yes, but probably only once. The event
took place in 1908 during a stay at the hotel in Cabourg, which later
served as the model for Balbec in the novel: on the last day of his
visit he went to see a Punch-and-Judy show.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 "This was apparently Proust's first movie," Carter writes in a footnote,
 "it may also have been his last. The cinema was one of the modern
 inventions that interested him little" (<I>MP</I>, 866). According to
 the biographer, Proust presented his friend Marcel Plantevignes with a
 copy of his French translation of Ruskin's <I>The Bible of Amiens</I>
 just before the film began.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The choice of gift seems strangely apt. The gesture brings Proust's
 devotion to the art of <I>vitraux</I> exemplified in Amiens cathedral
 back to mind, and suggests his fascination--in spite of himself--with
 that twentieth-century art form that most powerfully renovates the
 optical phenomenology of stained glass. Morever, the juxtaposition of
 religious scenes characteristic of medieval, stained-glass window-making
 anticipates the modernist emphasis of art cinema on montage and
 mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. In this regard, it is interesting to recall that
 Godard has often maintained that Christianity represents a type of
 cinema, precisely on account of its obsession with the spectacularized
 image: "I invoke Christianity as the original film; it is there for every
 painter, it is something literature has not done" (<I>ACMS</I>, 77).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his book <I>The Proustian Quest</I>, Carter remarks that in the first
two decades of the twentieth century, motion pictures offered Proust
and others (for example, Mirabeau, L&eacute;ger) an ideal model for
describing the sensation of movement in the mechanized modern era.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Carter cites a section of the <I>Recherche</I> in which Proust
 arrestingly likens the passage of a group on horseback to its own
 cinematic image. The tableau is that of Odette being greeted by the
 Prince de Sagan and his team of riders who advance past her as though
 "filmed at a gallop in the blinding glare of the avenue."
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Although it is rare, as Anne Henry notes, that film so plainly exerts
 its hold over the Proustian imagination, the novelist doubtless knew
 that his ocular preoccupations were ahead of their time.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 For example, Proust persistently indulged an interest in visual
 perspectivism; such fluidity of outlook enabled him to resist the
 finality of psychological judgments upon his characters: "Nothing is
 farther away from the analysis of a character than this succession of
 points of view which defines them. Now, by the same token, nothing is
 more modern in our century of images than such an approach" (<I>TMP</I>,
 223).

Even if it may be involuntary, the filmic subtext of Proust's article
"Impressions de route en automobile," published in <I>Le ro</I>
on 19 November, 1907, is nonetheless

<B></B>

unmistakable. Reworked in the <I>Recherche</I> in the famous description
of Martinville steeples, the essay details his drives with Alfred
Agostinelli to visit Gothic cathedrals in Normandy. In the novel, he
conveys the exhilaration of kinetic sensations associated with riding
in an automobile in terms of a heightened experience of perspectival
shift. In the original essay, however, his account of the continuously
mutating point of view resulting from the car ride climaxes with the
startling epiphany of a motion picture. At night in the town of Lisieux,
while straining to see or, as he adds, at least to touch the stony
foliage of the cathedral of Notre Dame, he is suddenly confronted by
the spectacle of an overtly cinematic nativity scene:

But at the very moment when I was approaching it groping blindly, a sudden
radiance inundated it; trunk by trunk, the pillars emerged from the night,
vividly detaching, in full light against a background of shadow, the
large pattern of their leaves of stone. It was my driver, the resourceful
Agostinelli, who, sending to the ancient sculptures the greeting of a
present whose light served all the better to read the lessons of the past,
directed the fires of his headlights successively over all the parts of
the portico in such measure as I wanted to see them. And when I returned
to the car I saw a group of children whom curiosity had drawn close
and who,bending toward the lights heads whose curls fluttered in that
supernatural luminousity, reconstituted here, as if projected from the
cathedral in a ray of light, the angelic ration of a nativity scene.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The darkness and the mechanical blaze of the headlights seem to reproduce
the phenomenological conditions of a movie theater (or perhaps more
precisely a drive-in), opening up a space for the "projection" of the
improvised nativity scene. The scene is all the more dramatic for its
juxtaposition of the mythical past in the shape of the cathedral to the
new myths of modernity in the shape of the car and, we might want to add,
the cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the <I>Recherche</I>, however, motion pictures do not receive a
flattering representation. Besides the description of the team of
riders greeting Odette, we find only four other references to the
"cin&eacute;matographique," all in <I>Le temps retrouv&eacute;</I> and
all reaffirming the superiority of literary or metaphoric representation
over the cinematic.

If reality were indeed a sort of waste product of experience, more or
less identical for each one of us, since when we speak of bad weather,
a war, a taxi rank, a brightly lit restaurant, a garden full of flowers,
everybody knows what we mean, if reality were no more than this, no
doubt a sort of cinematograph film of these things would be sufficient
and the "style," the"literature" that departed from the simple data that
they provide would be superfluous and artificial. But was it true that
reality was no more than this? (

Proust clearly means this last question to be understood rhetorically,
since he had already observed in a preceding passage that "nothing
is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that
the cinematograph presents" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 917; <I>RDTP</I>, IV:
461). In such passages, Proust shows little awareness that the impact
of film resides not in the ability of the camera to capture images,
but in the potential of montage to incorporate time.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, Proust firmly defines the novel as a whole as the
"optical instrument" with which the writer furnishes the reader to refine
his or her perception of the world (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 949; <I>RDTP</I>,
IV: 489-90). If we surmise that the model for this optical instrument
may be film, we do so not simply because, ever since his childhood in
Combray, the narrator has been beguiled by the mysterious "magic lantern"
that projects the endlessly mesmerizing story of Golo and Genevi&egrave;ve
de Brabante.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As Anne Henry has noted, we arrive at this intuition, because the
 narrative mechanism that organizes the <I>Recherche</I> is nothing other
 than montage. Rather than a serial succession of events such as can
 be found in the more linear plots of Balzac and Zola, we encounter in
 Proust's <I>chef d'oeuvre</I> a circuitous conjunction of heterogeneous
 moments and concerns. The discrete events comprising the <I>Recherche</I>
 unfold according to a variety of different perspectives and narrative
 detours which achieve synthesis only by means of the work of montage:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Proust is therefore driven to inaugurate this modern technique: montage,
that is to say an artificial continuity obtained by adjusting sequences
built independently from one another, belonging to different domains
and yet receiving a superior unity from the general project. . . . The
strength of this kind of montage is to be found not in the effort to
produce aesthetic effects, alternation, symmetry, etc., but in the fact
that it is placed at the service of a demonstration. As one says in
cinematic language, it is an
<I>ideological</I>
montage. (

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Henry's vision of a "superior unity from the general project" which
holistically emerges from the novel's independently built sequences is
consistent with Proust's revelation that he composed the <I>Recherche</I>
non-sequentially, writing the first chapter of the first volume and the
last chapter of the last volume in succession and then filling in the
intervening episodes. Regarding this authorial method we should also
recall the novel's vivid depiction of the narrator's work routine. Like
a director, the narrator Marcel constructs his manuscript through
the procedures of collage and montage by having Fran&ccedil;oise,
the domestic, cut and paste the text into a new arrangement every day
(<I>ROTP</I>, III: 1090; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 610). At the level of narrative
macroeconomics, the montage technique permits the simultaneous development
of three divergent main themes, which, following Deleuze's suggestion,
we might classify as the narrator and his social life, the narrator and
his sentimental education, and the narrator and his artistic vocation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet even at the level of its linguistic microeconomics, the
<I>Recherche</I> relies on an inherently cinematic device. The novel's
well-known predilection for metaphorical expression is not only manifested
through the mere choice of the appropriate, poetic image; rather, the
<I>Recherche</I> develops a sort of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of metaphor
through an insistence on the technique of superimposition. That is to say,
the <I>Recherche</I> aims to capture in writing how consciousness sustains
moments of optical equivocation, how the mind blends together one image
with another, a practice compounded by photographic technology. Indeed,
the experience of <I>la m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>--the novel's
philosophical nucleus--functions as a superimposition of two images,
a process that in

<B></B>

its psychological, temporal, and visual aspects ultimately achieves the
effect of film.
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 When Marcel reaches the Guermantes courtyard late in the novel and trips
 on the uneven paving stones, he is reminded of an earlier visit to Venice
 and expresses his happiness in terms of "evoked images": "A profound
 azure intoxicated my eyes, impressions of coolness, of dazzling light,
 swirled round me and in my desire to seize them . . . I continued,
 ignoring the evident amusement of the great crowd of chauffeurs, to
 stagger as I had staggered a few seconds ago, with one foot on the
 higher paving-stone and the other on the lower" (<I>ROTP</I>, III:
 899; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 445-46). Not only are these sensations
 provoked by involuntary memory described in visual terms; the moment
 of epiphany itself is presented as a sort of visual <I>ralenti</I>
 in which the narrator's image is nearly frozen as he strikes a fateful
 pose. The cinematic logic pursued by involuntary memory defamiliarizes
 the very itinerary of recollection from the slow-motion unwinding of
 the epiphany through its culminating freeze-frame of the narrator to
 the ultimate superimposition of two images--one of Venice, the other
 of the "Guermantes courtyard"--which have no organic connection to one
 another. This logic delivers a shock to the narrator precisely because
 no clear hermeneutic connection can be established between the two images
 conjoined within involuntary memory: "Owing to the work of oblivion, the
 returning memory can throw no bridge, form no connecting link between
 itself and the present minute" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 903; <I>RDTP</I>,
 IV: 449). As there is no apparent rational link between the two images,
 the operation of involuntary memory finally must be assessed in terms
 of a cinematic "superimposition."
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The critic who has been most closely attuned to Proust's cinematic
sensibility is Walter Benjamin, and it is no accident that he, in his
major essay on Proust, focuses on the central role of the image within
the <I>Recherche</I>. He observes that Proust treats the relation of
resemblance between two things according to the code of the dream world,
through the intervention of a third element: "the image."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Rather than providing a smooth synthetic integrity, the image jars the
 reader of Proust through its "beatings of wings" and "small shocks"
 ("IOP," 208).
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "The beatings of wings" aptly typifies the Proustian mise-en-sc&egrave;ne
 of superimposition, a poetic that also corresponds to the crucial
 notion of "intermittences" ("IOP," 203). Given this understanding of
 the image as the presentiment of an uncanny similarity between disparate
 things, we should not be surprised that Benjamin, in the "Theses on the
 Philosophy of History," also identifies the image as the proper means
 of access to the historical past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "Theses" conceive of history as a stream of visual "monads" that,
by virtue of their perpetual recombination, fleetingly suggest a larger
pattern of correlation. At the center of this current of fragments,
we encounter the most elusive image of all: "The true image of the past
flits by. The Past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at
the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again."
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Benjamin's definition of history in the "Theses" never strays very
 far from the language with which he discusses memory in Proust. His
 insistence that history's authentic image vanishes at the moment
 it "flashes up" bears a strong resemblance to his exposition of
 <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> in "The Image of Proust": "When the
 past is reflected in the dewy fresh

<B></B>

'instant,' a painful shock of rejuvenation pulls it together ... But this
very concentration, in which things that normally just fade and slumber
consume themselves in a flash is called rejuvenation" ("IOP," 211).
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 It seems particularly fitting to stress the latency or dormancy of the
 material expended by involuntary memory when we consider the dream-like
 suddenness with which the apparition of the narrator's dead grandmother
 in the novel is superimposed upon the empty room where Marcel is about
 to take off his boots (<I>ROTP</I>, II: 783; <I>RDTP</I>, III: 152).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, the fictive and linguistic practices of the <I>Recherche</I>
could be said to exemplify the operation of a cinematic unconscious.
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In the novel, both superimposition and montage help to establish a larger
 tropology according to which existence is defined as a function of ocular
 perception. And in consonance with this tropology, the novel presents
 the approach of death as the moment when we see the moving pictures of
 our lives unreeling before our eyes. Within a certain vein of modernist
 discourse this conceit has become familiar, crucially animating essays
 by both Benjamin and Pier Paolo Pasolini; in Proust's novel the trope
 provides the allegorical horizon within which the <I>Recherche</I>
 reveals its ideal form as a film. Benjamin's celebrated essay "The
 Storyteller" portrays the mythical moment preceding death as the occasion
 when "a sequence of images is set in motion inside a man as his life
 comes to an end," and meaning thereby becomes transmissible.
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In his article "Observations on the Sequence Shot," Pasolini argues
 that death instantaneously effects the final cut of one's life, putting
 significant moments into perspective by arranging them in sequence.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Both these writers may be viewed as performing variations on the theme
 established by Proust at the end of the <I>Recherche</I> when Marcel,
 contemplating himself on the verge of death, seems to experience the
 sudden transformation of his consciousness into a kinetic visual
 projection of his entire past. The very circular structure of the
 <I>Recherche</I> enforces the presentation of the narrative as a
 cinematic <I>apr&egrave;s-coup</I>, a print that will outlive the
 narrator.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The trope of life as cinematic spectacle elaborates the novel's
central concept of involuntary memory, which, as Benjamin points out,
is comparable in effect to the rapid screening of an emotionally charged
or significant image. In a handwritten text found among the critic's
paperwork after his death and entitled "From a Brief Speech on Proust
on the Occasion of My Fortieth Birthday," he explicitly compares <I>la
m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> to a movie trailer or review of our death:

Concerning involuntary memory . . . one might say that a tiny image,
a photo of ourselves, is appended to our deepest moments exactly as on
certain packs of cigarettes. And that "whole life" that, as we often
hear, passes before the dying or before those people who are in danger of
dying, is composed precisely of such tiny images. They present a rapid
streaming like in those notebooks, the precursors of cinematographs,
in which, when we were children, we could admire a boxer, a swimmer,
or tennis player at his art.

According to Benjamin, then, Proust's "notebooks" are cinematic as a
consequence of the narrator's existential point of view, since it is
only his imminent death that endows the fragmentary layers of images,
the passing of involuntary memories, with that elusive

<B></B>

fluency of meaning characteristic of film. If the usual gratifications
of narrative terminus seem dubious at the end of the <I>Recherche</I>,
they are so not only because of the unlikeliness of Marcel's having a
lifetime of sufficient remaining length to write the book we have just
read. The novel seems open-ended rather because its meaning consists in
an eternal return of the same, no longer as a text but as a film. This
is to say that, in the end, the <I>Recherche</I> provides an anticipatory
glimpse of its own afterlife. The task which the narrator must shoulder,
as he recognizes, is to give birth not just to a new work of art, but
altogether to a new type of art. It is the drive to achieve not merely
the latest in the expected output of artistic products, but a change in
the very methods of production that gives <I>&Agrave; la recherche du
temps perdu</I> its radical force.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To come back to Godard, what makes his <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>
such a suggestive adaptation of the <I>Recherche</I> is in large part
the film's successful assimilation and refinement of a Benjaminian view
of Proust's novel.
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Godard's and Benjamin's interpretations of the novel coincide in so far
 as both privilege an understanding of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>
 in terms of an expressly visual dialectic of recollection and
 forgetfulness. However, Benjamin's work provides Godard not only
 with an aesthetics of reminiscence, but also with an ideal of the
 politically redemptive value of history. In this sense, Godard composes
 his <I>Histoire(s)</I> through a contamination of Proust's doctrine
 of involuntary memory with Benjamin's problematic of history. As the
 French director himself puts it, "the future bursts amid remembrances"
 (<I>HDC</I>, III: 12). Godard's ambiguous description of the arrival
 of the future as a violent or shocking occurrence already hints at
 the political and cultural fatalism that will frame his unveiling of a
 Proustian history of cinema. Such an attitude represents an extension
 of Benjamin's melancholy position with regard to history, capitalism,
 and the epoch of the commodity.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One essay crucial to an understanding of <I>Histoire(s) du
cin&eacute;ma</I> is Benjamin's "Theses on the Philosophy of History." In
<I>The Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin had already defined history
not as an objective science but as a form of subjective remembrance
[<I>Eingedenken</I>] (<I>AP</I>, 471). On this score, it is in Benjamin's
wake that we should position Godard's resistance to linear narrative
and preference for constellations of images.
<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 His affinity for the critic's view of history embraces not only a
 common imagistic method, but also a similar preoccupation with the
 end of time in its political and religious dimensions. Godard shares
 a belief with the later Benjamin, albeit ambivalent or "weak" in the
 philosophical sense, that history provides the messianic horizon of a
 possible resurrection of art as cinema.
<SUP><A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the image for Godard inherently carries a promise of the
 redemption of reality: "The image is first of all of the order of
 redemption, look here, that of reality" (<I>HDC</I>, III: 149). In
 the age of commodification nothing speaks to the contemporary
 <I>Zeitgeist</I> with more iconoclastic candor, nor offers greater
 hope of cultural salvation. We should not forget that, for Godard,
 Christianity represents the ideal origin of cinema, precisely because it
 constructs an allegorical iconology on the foundation of a revolutionary
 historiography. It is hardly accidental

<B></B>

that one of the epigrammatic refrains of the film, inspired by Saint
Paul, avows that "the image will return at the time of resurrection"
(<I>HDC</I>, IV: 75).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Godard as for Benjamin, the messianic horizon is linked to a "moment
of danger." Benjamin writes: "To articulate the past historically does
not mean to recognize it 'the way it really was' (Ranke); it means to
seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. . . . In
every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from
a conformism that is about to overpower it" ("TPH," 255). There is
no doubt that it is to the mindless conformism of Hollywood and the
totalizing domination of mass-market consumerism that Godard opposes
his <I>Histoire(s)</I>:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elsewhere, Godard reiterates this point when, adopting a pastiche of
H&ouml;lderlin's and Heidegger's metaphysical terminology, he imagines
the world as a realm deserted by gods where the function of the artist is
to rediscover the necessity of the sacred: "Not only have the gods and
god fled, but the splendor of divinity is extinguished in the history
of the world" (<I>HDC</I>, I: 245).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Godard and Benjamin share similar notions of memory and of history,
their respective approaches to cinema might seem at first sight very
different. Certainly, Godard would reject the German critic's initial
appraisal of cinema. In his 1936 essay "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction," Benjamin links the emergence of cinema to the
destruction of the aura of the work of art. However, Benjamin also labors
to elucidate the politically liberating consequences of the disconnection
of film from traditional culture.
<SUP><A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Yet, by the time of his 1939 article, "Some Motifs in Baudelaire,"
 Benjamin proceeds to explore the question of aura in a different frame
 of mind, complicating his first "political" definition with nostalgic
 overtones.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his accompanying commentary upon the <I>Histoire(s)</I>, Godard
clearly articulates his nostalgia for the aura of lost cinema. We should
bear in mind here that he defines film neither as an art nor a science,
but rather as a "mystery," a word that invites interpretation in terms
of the auratic.
<SUP><A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 According to Miriam Hansen, the auratic in Benjamin never coincides
 with the unveiling of a symbolic integrity, but on the contrary with a
 "catastrophic and dislocating impact."
<SUP><A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The same is true of Godard's auratic cinema. In Godard's eyes, film is
 mysterious because it performs an allegorical movement, an alternating
 dispersion and concentration of signification. <I>Histoire(s)
 du cin&eacute;ma</I> aims to witness just that movement, in the
 process bringing to light the messianic possibility of a catastrophic
 change. Whereas for Benjamin history must attend to the experience
 of the vanquished, for Godard film must be given attention in so far
 as it has been vanquished by video, by digital technology, and more
 generally by what he defines as the "totalitarianism of the present"
 (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 286).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the most celebrated passage of the "Theses on the Philosophy of
History," Benjamin imagined history as the allegorical subject of
Klee's painting "Angelus Novus," a divine spectator who looks back on
the past while being propelled into the future amid a hail of debris by
a wind blowing from paradise ("TPH," 257-58). Strikingly, Benjamin
revives the metaphor at a pivotal juncture in "The Work of Art in the
Age of Mechanical Reproduction" when he imagines the advent of film:
"Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder by the dynamite
of the tenth of second, so that now, in the midst of its far-flung
ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go traveling" ("WOA,"
236). The resemblance of the two passages suggests that Benjamin at some
level associated cinema with the paradise from which the storm of the
future originates. Godard quite consciously appropriates and redeploys
this association. In the first, televised version of <I>Histoire(s) du
cin&eacute;ma</I>, at the end of Episode 1B, we thus encounter the image
of Klee's angel dramatically (and perhaps a bit self-aggrandizingly)
superimposed upon that of Godard himself (<I>NMQG</I>, 222). Behind
Godard's enterprise stands a Benjaminian insistence on the critical
recuperation of history, a retrieval of ephemeral images "flashing up"
to demand analysis in the present, because, as Benjamin puts it, "every
image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own
concerns threatens to disappear irretrievably" ("TPH," 255). Film offers
the ideal reservoir of such images, a reservoir that offers the advantage
of presenting historical events without adding causal explanations from
outside the events themselves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the philosophical standpoint of Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I> is the
same as that of Benjamin's "Theses," its methodology is closer to that
of <I>The Arcades Project</I>. Indeed, as an attempt to delineate the
specific physiognomy of the twentieth century from its fragmentary
cultural traces, through a collage of images and texts, <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I> reveals a genealogical relation to <I>The Arcades
Project</I>. As has been documented, Benjamin until the end of his life
pursued the project of a history of the "minor" or marginal, a project
applying the practices of historical materialism and articulated around
the emblematic res of the nineteenth century: arcades, whores,
gamblers, gilded mirrors, mechanical dolls. The resulting epigrammatic
sketches, organized into a kind of patchwork of quotations, contribute
to what Benjamin defined as a "dialectic at a standstill," a sort of
intransitive unveiling of the truth that avoids the illusion of linear
narrative progress. But as in the case of the "Theses," the theory
of collective memory developed in the <I>Arcades</I> also owes its
inspiration to the Proustian notion of involuntary memory, of which it
represents a sort of "objective," material aspect.

the arcade, film is able to provide a centrifugal mode of access to
meaning and history. Not only do Benjamin and Godard both espouse a
poetics of montage or quotation, they also share a determination to
escape the strictures of conventional historicism in order to unveil
the allegorical res that arise from the ruins of history. Even
Godard's written commentary upon <I>Histoire(s)</I> mimics the visual
procedures of montage, linking as it does citations or pastiches of
a variety of authors--philosophers, film critics, songwriters, poets,
and directors--who are listed

<B></B>

at the end of each volume, but not individually attributed. Film clearly
represents for Godard a sort of private or personal historical arcade,
a spectacular space that provides us with an "involuntary memory" of
the century. In this light, Benjamin and Godard may be seen to share
much the same project; both aim to perform a materialist critique of
culture by means of Proustian acts of remembrance, to expose the hidden
costs of production by means of a poetic recovery of the past. Such a
critique, far from enforcing an objectively verifiable or scientific
picture of events, provides access to history via the digressive,
subjective paths of allegory. Godard underlines this emphasis when
he writes, "why simplify when one can complicate?" (<I>HDC</I>, II:
78). If history becomes legible for Benjamin by alternation between the
mystical perspective of the "Theses" and the materialist approach of
the <I>Arcades</I>, we find in Godard the possibility of bringing the
two modes into convergence through the language of cinema, a language
that according to Godard expresses the "egality and fraternity between
real and fiction" (<I>HDC</I>, III: 126-27).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>, however, Godard intends to
superimpose his personal experience upon the collective, public face
of cinema. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> is an autobiographical
enterprise in spirit, since the material traces of film are also
reflections of Godard's own personal life story.
<SUP><A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 As he himself phrases it, "without cinema I would not have any history"
 (<I>HDC</I>, II: 39). Proclaiming the visual language of film as the
 mother tongue of the twentieth century, Godard refuses to provide
 an ostensibly objective, chronological overview of the medium. To
 the question of historical origin he responds instead by taking the
 invention of motion pictures as the revolutionary new beginning of a
 certain way of looking at the world, the emergence of cinema in this
 sense standing for the birth of a peculiarly modern consciousness of
 estrangement. We thus find three historical levels "superimposed" on one
 another in the <I>Histoire(s)</I>: the personal, the communal, and the
 cinematic. The titles of the first two segments--"Toutes les histoires"
 and "Une histoire seule"--imply the constantly viable possibility in
 <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> of a <I>Gestalt</I> switch between
 two ways of thinking about the medium: in terms of its social currency
 as spectacle or in terms of its psychical value as allegory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is well known that Deleuze's theory of cinema divides the history of
the medium into two periods: that of the "movement-image" and that of the
"time-image." Coinciding with Italian Neorealism and the French New Wave,
the second period represents the equivalent of a Kantian revolution
of cinema in as much as it overturns the silent era's subordination of
temporality to movement and instead comes to enact what Deleuze, employing
a very Proustian formulation, calls "temps &agrave; l'&eacute;tat pur."
<SUP><A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 We might surmise that it is because the most recent productions
 of the movie industry threaten to eradicate art cinema between
 Hollywood's bloated overcommodification of the medium and the
 atemporality of digital technology that Godard resolves to resurrect
 the time-image. <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> should be regarded
 as an exploration of the autobiographical value of the time-image,
 an effort advanced in a Proustian mood to distill from the fractured
 remnants of the past a "pure history." If Godard's <I>Histoire(s)</I>
 shares with Proust's <I>Recherche</I> a similar inspiration we should
 also note that it runs a

<B></B>

similar risk of appealing to a regressive or at least nostalgic
mentality. Since film (as opposed to television or video) represents
for Godard a sort of idealized childhood of the arts, his enterprise
in <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> may be regarded, like Proust's
in <I>&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu</I>, as an attempt to regain
infancy (<I>HDC</I>, I: 238).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Godard, cinema is best defined not in terms of ontological
presence &agrave; la Bazin, but rather in terms of metaphorical
and historical representation (<I>ACMS</I>, 67). And like Proust,
Godard affirms a poetics of shock or paradox by cultivating visual
superimposition in order to sustain epistemelogical instabilities, by
performing a "batt&eacute;ments" of images, a deployment of signs that
we might describe in Benjaminian accents as a "beating of wings."
<SUP><A NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 At stake in this agitated beating of images is the "fatal beauty" of
 film, its uniquely sublime quality. As Godard declares elsewhere in
 <I>Histoire(s)</I>, "only cinema" mobilizes itself with such unnerving
 ostentation. To better highlight the metaphorical function of film,
 Godard, like Proust, actively experiments with the condensation and
 displacement of images, confronting us with a visual archive of the
 century that exemplifies the paradox of superimposition: "That which
 is above all at the base, it's always two, always presenting from
 the start two images instead of one; it's what I define as the image,
 this image made of two, that is to say the third image" (<I>ACMS</I>,
 27). As a strategy of visualization, superimposition corresponds to a
 complicated and enigmatic philosophy of history within whose terms the
 past manifests itself as a palimpsest that is always in the process of
 being revised. Godard, the narrator, orients our cinematic excursion
 through the labyrinth of history by means of a sardonic, frequently
 melancholic commentary that propounds a poetics of quotation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jacques Aumont interprets the melancholic tone as the lament of
an artist-critic for his lost or defunct art (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>,
168). By way of an allegorical recapitulation of the project of the
<I>Recherche</I>, Godard aspires to recapture his ideal of the "film
perdu," once a certain type of cinema has run its course:

We can say, in general, that a certain idea of cinema, not
Lumi&egrave;re's but that which was perhaps pursued by Feuillade and
continued by Delluc, Vigo, and from which I do not consider myself to be
far, this idea of cinema is over, as the Fontainebleau school is over,
as Italian painting is over. . . . One can say that a certain cinema has
now been achieved. As Hegel put it, an epoch is finished. Afterward it
is different. One feels sad because childhood has been lost. (

Just like literature in the <I>Recherche</I>, cinema in <I>Histoire(s)</I>
is not "sheltered from time," but simply "the shelter of time"
(<I>HDC</I>, IV: 299). This is another way of saying that Godard's
<I>Histoire(s)</I> does not embrace the machinery of archival history. To
the order of the archive, Godard opposes the aura of involuntary memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, Godard's intuitive, dream-like layering of images resembles
involuntary memory more than it does organized montage. As if to drive
the point home, during the four-hour course of the <I>Histoire(s)</I>
we are repeatedly shown a self-referential scene of the director gazing
with somewhat lax attention at the film as it passes by on his editing
table. Although we might regard such an image as a way of thematizing
the hermeneutical problematic of the film, that problematic is framed
by Godard not in

<B></B>

analytic terms, as Bergala has remarked, but in emotional terms, in terms
of distress and consolation: "We should most of all refrain from thinking,
<I>before the authority of the completed work</I>, that Godard has always
been sure about which <I>shots</I> he was looking for, and that he knew
in which films and in which place in those films to find them. The most
troubling shots are those regained when they were inaccessible to the
convocation of his voluntary memory" (<I>NMQG</I>, 241).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the choice of images that constitute the <I>Histoire(s)</I> we should
recognize not so much Godard's logical ordering of experience as his
spontaneous election to an intensified state of consciousness by his
memories of forgotten films. The obsessive return of certain images
suggests that Godard has been chosen by his memories in so far as he
allows them to resurface.
<SUP><A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 We might say that Godard unveils the Proustian unconsciousness of
 cinema to the extent that he reveals even montage in its ostensible
 identity as a visual technology to obey the involuntary rhythms of the
 subjective. A sly illustration of this point may be found in Episode 3B
 (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 17), where, after an eruption of fragments from
 Rossellini's <I>Pais&agrave;</I> and Carn&eacute;'s <I>La belle et la
 b&ecirc;te</I>, we abruptly encounter the legend, "Hardly Working,"
 which ironically raises the question of the psychic labor behind the
 editing. Although, on the one hand, montage may be work, its result
 resembles the effortless arbitrariness of the involuntary. It is on this
 ground that Aumont rightly considers Godard to be Proust's "brother"
 (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 225).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Aumont's judgment is to some extent invited by the director; in Episode
2B of the <I>Histoire(s)</I>, which is entitled "Fatale beaut&eacute;,"
references to the <I>Recherche</I> are made openly and at some
length. Godard emphatically repeats the name of Marcel's vanished
and mysterious love, Albertine. On the screen the phrase "le temps
perdu" flashes out several times. This evocation of Proust's enigmatic
female protagonist occurs not accidentally during a meditation on the
nature of cinema, which Godard equates with its function neither as
art nor as technique, but as <I>mystery</I>: "I said: neither an art,
nor a technique, but a mystery (voice of Godard). Time regained. Only
cinema. All alone. Mystery" (<I>HDC</I>, II: 154-55). Yet his very
insistence on the value of film as the embodiment of regained time
may also be read as an admission of the medium's untimely status or
condition. If the <I>Recherche</I> is written at the dawn of cinema,
the <I>Histoire(s)</I> awakens to its sunset, a distance that Godard
captures by ironically rewriting Proust's famous first sentence, "for a
long time I used to go to sleep early," as "for a long time I used to
wake up unhappily." The punning conversion of "early" ("bonne heure"
in the original version, which itself echoes "bonheur"--happiness)
to "unhappily" ("malheur" in the original) or unhappiness brings to
light at once the proximate, but also mutated, condition of Godard's
present relative to Proust's past. The director's mise-en-sc&egrave;ne
must dispense with elegiac niceties, and his own search for lost cinema
will be conducted, according to Aumont, as the potential final chapter
in the history of art (<I>AMN&Eacute;</I>, 149). Indeed, immediately
after airing his revision of Proust's incipit, Godard indulges in a bit
of wordplay on the phrase "le temps retrouv&eacute;" (time regained)
by typographically highlighting the "trou," the hole or empty space,
at the heart of the adjective "retrouv&eacute;."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's opus is Proustian in spirit because it manages to evoke the
involuntary intermittence of our memories of film in a first-person
narrative voice: "All that remains

<B></B>

of films are a few images in our memory" (<I>ACMS</I>, 85). Moreover,
for the French director the history of cinema does not contribute
to any larger optimism regarding the revolutionary triumph of the
social collective. Instead, Godard's historical outlook derives from
an anxious sense of the singularity and frailty of personal memory,
and it is in this light that his aims can be considered Proustian. His
effort is not to construct a systematic catalog of film memories that
provide immediate access to history, but to retrieve a few fragmentary
touchstones that, like Proust's involuntary memories, redeem the past
by means of indication or suggestion. Paradoxically, these touchstones
can be recovered only through a process of forgetting. It is precisely
in the readiness of consciousness to brave the threat of erasure
that he locates the possibility of recollection as an aesthetic act:
"Whoever wishes to remember must trust to oblivion, to that risk which
is absolute oblivion, and to the beautiful accident that might then
become the remembrance" (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 128-29). Whereas the
visual composition of <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> demonstrates
that films may provide the material analogue <I>par excellence</I> of
memory, Godard's assertion implies that their evocative power rests on
what Aumont defines as "amn&eacute;sie."
<SUP><A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 It is Godard's intention to save a select few auratic images and thus the
 essence of art cinema at the very moment when the cybernetic practice
 of the information archive or database seemingly replaces that of a
 living cultural memory (<I>NMQG</I>, 216).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Godard's cultivation of a sort of involuntary memory of cinema shows
to what degree cinema as a medium is well suited, probably better than
literature, to elaborate the phenomenology of remembrance.
<SUP><A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 He suggests that, by virtue of its nonchalance of retrospection,
 film makes it possible to rewrite the myth of Orpheus in a less
 tragic key than literature permits: "Cinema authorizes Orpheus to
 turn back without killing" (<I>HDC</I>, II: 96-97). However,
 if the history of cinema revises the ideology of involuntary memory
 in a compelling way, <I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I> at the same
 time bears witness to the approaching terminus of that history, to the
 disappearance of film's Orphic potential. In this light, the Proust
 who is a true brother to Godard is not only a disenchanted, Deleuzian
 semiotician, but also an elegiac spirit for whom "the true paradises are
 the paradises that we have lost" (<I>ROTP</I>, III: 903; <I>RDTP</I>, IV:
 449). <I>Histoire(s)</I> ends on a freeze-frame of a rose superimposed
 over a still image of Godard himself. Over this literally arresting
 vision, the voiceover intones "if a man crossing paradise in a dream
 received a flower as proof of his transit and, on awakening, found
 the flower in his hands, what else would he say but I was this man"
 (<I>HDC</I>, IV: 306-11).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is at the intersection of the Proustian poetic of involuntary memory
with the Benjaminian doctrine of messianic history, then, that we should
position Godard's faith in the resurrection of cinema. After all, at its
invention the medium of film was taken so seriously as a technological
means of resuscitating the dead that, as Christian-Marc Boss&eacute;no
reminds us, somebody in 1905 went about providing cemeteries with
projectors to show movies of the dearly departed.
<SUP><A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In this light, Godard's redemptive valediction to art cinema looks
 back through a messianic conception of the medium to the very origin of
 film itself, so completing a circular motion that is a quintessentially
 Proustian authorial gesture.

"Someone had indeed had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on
evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used
to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come;
and, after the fashion of the master-builders and glass-painters of
Gothic days, it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable
iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends
were depicted as on a shifting and transitory window. . . . And, indeed,
I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which seemed to
emanate from a Merovingian past and shed around me the reflections of
such ancient history. But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at this
intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in
filling with my own personality until I thought no more of it than of
myself" (<I>ROTP</I>, I: 9-11; <I>RDTP</I>, I: 9-10). In this
passage, Proust seems to provide a possible link between the luminosity
of stained glass and the projectedness of film, a spectral effect that he
associates with the two terms "mystery" and "beauty." The former term, we
should note, also supplies Godard's definition of cinema in <I>Histoire(s)
du cin&eacute;ma</I>. In fact, one of the litanies recurring throughout
his film is the sentence "neither an art, nor a technique, a mystery."

The invention of superimposition dates back to the first generation of
cinematographers (1895-1927), who were active roughly in the same
years in which Proust was writing. We might define the technique as the
layering or fusing together of multiple exposures within the same shot,
permitting the condensation or dilation of time and space, and thus the
production of an image endowed with a third dimension besides length
and width--that is to say, depth.

This hypothesis finds support in Benjamin's own selection of examples for
his decidedly cinematic idea of the "optical unconscious," examples that
remind us of the specific instances of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I>
catalogued in the final section of the <I>Recherche</I>. In his celebrated
essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", Benjamin
equates the optical unconscious with such peculiar moments of perception
as when we notice "a person's posture during the fraction of a stride"
and "the act of reaching for a spoon and how it might fluctuate with
our moods." It is striking how closely these examples resemble the two
crucial instances of <I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> at the end of
the <I>Recherche</I> when the narrator trips over a cobblestone and
overhears the sound of a spoon knocked against a plate (<I>ROTP</I>,
III: 900; <I>RDTP</I>, IV: 446). It could be said that Benjamin exposes
the cinematic unconscious of the novel in the sense that he reveals the
<I>Recherche</I> as an "involuntary" exploration of the filmic. See
Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,"
<I>Illuminations</I>, 237, henceforth cited within the text as "WOA."

Driving this point home, Ruiz's adaptation of <I>Le temps
retrouv&eacute;</I> opens promisingly with the tableau of the author
on his deathbed, surrounded in his room by his <I>paper&ocirc;les</I>
and Celeste Albaret. (In the <I>Recherche</I> the narrator's cerebral
seizure, a virtual "review" of death, takes place at the end of <I>Le
temps retrouv&eacute;</I>.) Ruiz not only deliberately conflates the
narrator's life with Proust's own, but also strategically displaces
the approach of death from its logical position to the very start of
the film. Unfortunately, the cleverness of the film's opening is more
than offset by the gimmickry of its closure, as Ruiz attempts a sort
of extradiegetic deconstruction of the idea of film as biography. The
movie closes on the beach at Balbec where "Marcel enfant" is looked
upon by "Marcel adulte," in a sequence too studiedly reminiscent of
Visconti's adaptation of <I>Death in Venice</I>. Meanwhile, a voice-over
recounts the story of the sculptor Salvini who, as his end draws near,
is offered an opportunity to review all the significant moments of his
life by the angel of death. Salvini refuses, pleading instead for the
right merely to reassess his last work of art, entitled the "Triumph
of Death." However, this act of self-judgment proves impossible:
"There is a paradox in all this, Salvini exclaimed, I had enough time
to review all the instants of my life, which lasted sixty-three years,
and the same amount of time has not sufficed for surveying a work which
I finished within three months." As the angel of death explains, the
reason for the paradox is the fact that a work of art embodies not only
the author's life, but indeed the lives of all people. This story, which
does not come from the <I>Recherche</I>, is an awkward interpolation,
as it establishes an apparently transcendental distinction between life
and oeuvre, autobiography and fiction, that Proust had carefully tried
to efface. See Raoul Ruiz et Gilles Taurand, "Le temps retrouv&eacute;,"

As will be evident to anyone who has read his recent interviews about
<I>Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma</I>, Godard seems drawn to Benjamin
as a source of constant intellectual reflection. One example of
Benjamin's influence is Godard's frequent recurrence to the word
"constellation"--with explicit reference to the German critic's
precedent--in order to signify his intention to establish a resonance
between present and past. As Youssef Ishaghpour observes, allusions to
Benjamin are also preponderant in a recent film by Godard and Anne Marie

The First International Dada Fair held in Berlin in 1920 holds a most
significant place within the history of the 20th-century avant-garde
(<A HREF="8.4white_1.html"> 1</A>). It marks the point where
modernist practices of fragmentation, disruption and shock were aimed
directly at the German public by utilizing the strategies of contemporary
journalism and advertising. Political protest was combined with attack on
the exalted status of art, the death of which was famously proclaimed by
one placard at the exhibition. A German soldier's uniform with a pig's
head was hung from the ceiling, provoking legal action and ensuring
good tabloid coverage. The walls of the exhibition rooms were covered
with posters and banners which competed for attention with the more
traditional paintings of Otto Dix and George Grosz, although their
subject matter--crippled war veterans and urban disorder--was suitably
confrontational. Photomontage, a new medium recently seized upon by the
dadaists, was prominently placed, recycling imagery from the illustrated
press for satirical or absurd ends. And in the midst of all this could
be found a tower of found objects, newspapers, and textual fragments
assembled by Johannes Baader and known as the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>
(<A HREF="8.4white_2.html"> 2</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some objects from the Dada Fair have subsequently become museum pieces and
are now iconic images of the period, an example being Hannah H&ouml;ch's
large photomontage <I>Cut with the Kitchen Knife</I>. In fact, art
historians have slaved long and hard to identify as many of the sources
for this montage as possible and offered sustained interpretations of
it on the basis of their findings.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Baader's sculpture has a very different status, given that it did not
 survive the exhibition and is only known through

<B></B>

photographs. Even so it is widely considered to be a crucial object in
the history of modernism: "definitely the first assemblage-environment
in the history of art," for Helen Adkins, "one of the first large
assemblage-environments," according to Eberhard Roters, "an assemblage
of, until then, unparalleled proportions," in Stephen Foster's words.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It has also been described as "the most audacious of the diverse array
 of assemblages at the <I>Dada Fair</I>" and, according to Hanne Bergius,
 it deserves a new category of its own, <I>d&eacute;montage</I>, because
 of its unique, deconstructive nature.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Even though it has not been preserved, it is surprising that no similar
 attempt has yet been made to produce a close reading of Baader's
 object. It is my intention here to redress this situation so that the
 <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> might be more accurately situated within
 our current understanding of Dada and modernism in general.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first point of redress is to give the assemblage its full title,
not often quoted alongside reproductions: <I>Das gro&szlig;e
Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Deutschlands Gr&ouml;sse und Untergang
oder Die phantastische Lebensgeschichte des Oberdada</I>(The Great
Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Germany's Greatness and Decline or The Fantastic
Life of the Superdada). It did have, therefore, a very specific subject
matter. It was intended to be

<B></B>

read both as a description of recent German history and as autobiography
(Baader was known amongst his colleagues as <I>der Oberdada</I>). In
the first case the assemblage was a record of the fall of the German
empire, and in the second Baader's rise to fame. We shall see how
in both instances a departure was made from predominant models of,
firstly, history as rational progress, and secondly autobiography as
self-revelation. To the two movements which Baader aimed to represent,
decline and ascent, he gave the form of a sculptural and architectural
hybrid part tower, pyramid and spiral. The ultimate function of the
object was to be "Dada monumental architecture," and I will conclude by
considering how Baader's conception of death and remembrance was also
red in the object.

At first glance the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> appears to be totally
chaotic, an arbitrary collection of objects and texts stacked up in no
particular order. However, given the large amount of textual material
it is comprised of, it demands to be read. For its original public in
1920 there were two tools to assist them in this task. The first was
the exhibition catalogue. It described the piece as:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

 SRC="button/8.4white_3b.gif"> </A>

This draws our attention to the numbered labels attached to the
assemblage, dividing it into the sections specified. In the best
known photograph we can see numbers 1, 2, and 5. A second photograph of
unfortunately much inferior quality shows the assemblage from the reverse
angle and reveals that the number 4 was placed next to the hanging carbide
lamp (<A HREF="8.4white_3.html"> 3</A>). It is safe to surmise
therefore that 3 completed the pattern, and that the viewer was expected
to follow the numbers around in an ascending spiral. Baader imaginatively
incorporated both the floor on which the spectator stands and the empty
space above into the work. His reference to it as monumental architecture
has connotations of both commemoration and potential scale.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The key to the work that the full catalogue entry provided was further
enhanced by the appearance in the <I>Dada Almanach</I>which was published
to coincide with the end of the exhibition, of a "closer description"
of each story.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Here Baader offered various references which explain some but not all of
 the items in the assemblage. The first story, for example, connects his
 birth in 1875 to the emergence of the unified German state represented by
 Kaiser Wilhelm I's express train, erroneously misled by the assumption of
 an ever-unfolding future. Symbolically depicted, it continues traveling
 around the powder keg on a circular track until it finally explodes.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The second story 
is 

<B></B>

intended to represent the emergence of a "collective artistic culture
. . . in the tunnel of the doomed Reich," above which appears "a museum
of masterpieces through the ages" represented in the assemblage by two
arched gateways and a mousetrap.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 At the end of the tunnel stands Baader himself, seized by Platonic ideas
 which are "violating him, overpowering him," and he is only saved by the
 "spectre and outcome of the World War."
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The third and fourth stories concern the declaration of war, interpreted
 by Baader in terms of Revelations, and the war itself which he, seventy
 years before Baudrillard had the idea, declares to have been a media
 event: "a newspaper war. In reality it never existed."
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The newspapers included to represent this statement carry us on up
 to the fifth story, World Revolution, which emerges from the peace
 declared at Spa. Broadcasting into the ether via the aerial which is
 the final component of the work, Baader proclaims "the final redemption
 from suffering and death."
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Some items that are identifiable in the assemblage but not directly
 mentioned by Baader include, at the bottom, Raoul Hausmann's sound poems,
 cuttings from Dada journals such as Franz Jung's <I>Die Freie Strasse</I>
 (<I>The Free Street</I>), to which Baader had been a contributor,
 and at the summit an issue of <I>Die Pleite</I> (<I>Bankruptcy</I>).

"Germany's Greatness and Decline: or the Fantastic Life of the
Superdada," therefore, can be interpreted autobiographically, and it
stages a strange <I>Bildungsroman</I> which takes us from Baader's
childhood through to maturity. This is red in the object by the
transformation from Hausmann's sound poems, deliberately primitivizing
and perhaps mimicking baby talk, to the newspaper texts and their
"adult" language. That this route leads ultimately to <I>Die Pleite</I>
is an idea that will be returned to. From what we can see in the
photograph, we also have representations of Baader himself, first as
a small drawing to the right of the cog wheel with his name underneath
(<A HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>), and then in the middle left
standing next to the assemblage in the form of a tailor's dummy from whose
hand hangs the number "2" (<A HREF="8.4white_5.html"> 5</A>). The
appearance of a moustache on the latter is another means of representing
the passage of time. That this passage has now become the rejection of
reason rather than the adoption of it should not deflect from the formal
model with which Baader was playing.

Simultaneously, Baader intertwined images of the Wilhelmine empire keyed
to particular ideas of modernity. The express train already mentioned
can be understood as a reference to the rapid expansion of the railway
network under the <I>Kaiserreich</I>. Just behind the number "1"
on the assemblage, the toy train used to represent this can be seen
(<A HREF="8.4white_6.html"> 6</A>). An important policy of
the Wilhelmine government, investment in the rail infrastructure,
was brought to a grinding halt by the war, quite literally Wilhelm's
express train going nowhere. Baader may also have picked up on the use
of a similar image used by Jakob van Hoddis as the climactic line of
his 1911 poem <I>Weltende</I> (<I>End of the World</I>) which reads,
"trains tumble from bridges everywhere."
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Another point of reference may have been the fact that Wilhelm II, seeing
 his role in the First World War as military rather than political,
 spent much time away from Berlin near the front line. His preferred
 means of transport on these occasions was the royal train which doubled
 up as the imperial residence for much of 1914--1918.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 At the summit of the assemblage is a railway carriage,
 separated from the engine down below, stranded at Spa (<A
 HREF="8.4white_7.html"> 7</A>).

 SRC="button/8.4white_8b.gif"> </A>
Between first and second story is another reference to a major Wilhelmine
construction project, the "museum of masterpieces through the ages." The
architectural fragments and mousetrap undoubtedly refer to Baader's
previous career as an architect specializing in funerary monuments,
with the <I>Mausefalle</I> (mousetrap) punning with <I>Mausoleum</I>
(<A HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>). Pinned just above to
the right, however, we find a reproduction of Dirk Bouts' <I>Christ
in the House of Simon</I>, a fifteenth-century Flemish masterpiece
which had been purchased for the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in 1904
(<A HREF="8.4white_8.html"> 8</A>). The placement of the
mousetrap/mausoleum over the tunnel cleverly refers to the construction of
the <I>Museum-Insel</I> (Museum Island) in Berlin, an ambitious attempt to
confirm the cultural as well as political significance of the new capital
city. By positioning it over an empty space, Baader satirizes its lack
of foundation both literally and metaphorically. This cultural center in
Berlin had been begun with the building of Schinkel's <I>Altes Museum</I>
(1823-1830) (to the cupola of which the shape of the mousetrap may
also allude) and the <I>Neues Museum</I> (1843-1850), but the rapid
expansion of the royal collection led to the addition of the <I>Kaiser
Friedrich Museum</I> (1898-1903) and the <I>Pergamon Museum</I>
(1909-1930), all on the same site. The last of these museums,
designed specifically to house antiquities transported from Turkey,
clearly expressed a desire to place Berlin ahead not only of national
rivals Munich and Dresden, but also other European capitals in the
arts. It was also a famous characteristic of the <I>Museum-Insel</I>
that it was bisected by a major railway line leading in and out of
Friedrichstrasse Station, and that passengers were given fleeting glimpses
of the great collections as they passed through. That the museum should
follow the railway in Baader's assemblage is a cunning reference to
Berlin topography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most significant marker of modernity in the assemblage,
though, is its collection of newspapers. Baader has carefully
selected for inclusion local Berlin newspapers renowned for their "new
journalism." Prominent in the center of the construction is a copy of the
<I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> which, as Peter Fritzsche has demonstrated, was the
first paper to bring "urban reportage" to Berlin. It was a paper through
which to understand the growing and ever more confusing metropolis:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
New arrivals depended on newspapers to find work and housing, to sell
goods and services, and to identify urban types and negotiate local
institutions. Increasingly elaborate local reportage provided readers with
sketches of homelife in tenement buildings, public life along fashionable
streets, and work discipline inside factories and department stores. Over
time newcomers--readers--filled in the blank spaces of their mental maps
of Berlin. Not to read the newspaper was to risk losing orientation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Also prominently displayed by Baader is <I>BZ am Mittag</I>, a Berlin
tabloid founded as recently as 1904 which was sold on the street as a
"boulevard" newspaper. It takes its place alongside the Dada periodicals
some of which, such as <I>Die Pleite</I>, were also sold directly on the
streets. At the top, Baader created a signpost from newspaper cuttings:
<I>K&ouml;thener Strasse</I> in one direction, <I>Die Freie Strasse</I>
in the other (<A HREF="8.4white_7.html"> 7</A>). K&ouml;thener
Strasse is one of the roads adjoining Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's busiest
junction, which was a favorite location for journalists to linger and
report on the state of the traffic.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Once again, Baader integrated local topography into the assemblage,
this time connected to journalism and its role in guiding the public
through the chaos of the city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While it is interesting to consider the significance of the newspapers
and Dada journals in regard to urban orientation, it should also be
noted that, by 1920, Baader had himself become something of a tabloid
celebrity in Berlin. One of his most infamous acts, the disruption of a
service in the Berlin Cathedral in 1918, was reported in not fewer than
three of the local Berlin papers.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In addition to the reporting of this and other public stunts, Baader
 often played practical jokes through the Berlin press, such as the
 announcement of his death as an April fool's joke in 1919, followed up
 a little later by the notice of his resurrection.
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was itself preceded by a similar
 prank, the announcement in two Berlin papers, <I>BZ am Mittag</I> and
 the <I>Berliner-B&ouml;rsen Courier</I> of the loss of the manuscript
 of the <I>Fantastic Life of the Superdada</I>in the following absurd
 circumstances:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
While the Superdada was traveling home after his ascension on the evening
of the 13 May on the "W" train from Stettin station to Steglitz, in the
company of two angels who escort him, he left behind in the carriage
the manuscript of his Fantastic Life Story, due to be published
in five installments by Ernst Rowohlt. The finder is requested to
deliver the manuscript of the Superdada to Ernst Rowohlt Publishers,
Potsdamerstr. 123b, Berlin W.35 in return for a superdadaistic reward.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To read the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, then, involves understanding
how Baader had begun to live his life through the press and was no longer
interested in distinguishing

<B></B>

reality from reportage. In the assemblage, he has literally constructed
his subjectivity from tabloid journalism. In the context of the Dada
Fair, we can compare this to the appearance of another copy of the
<I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I><I>,</I> which George Grosz collaged into his
painting <I>Germany, A Winter's Tale</I> (visible in the background of <A
HREF="8.4white_1.html"> 1</A>). Here, a good <I>B&uuml;rger</I>
is depicted sitting in a caf&eacute;, drinking a glass of beer and reading
the local newspaper, oblivious to the violence and chaos surrounding
him. The newspaper is represented not as the key to interpreting social
conflict, but as escape from it; to read the <I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> is
red by Grosz as a marker of bad faith. When exhibited at the Dada
Fair, the painting was accompanied by a large banner stating that "Dada
is Political," which confirmed Grosz's opinion that the role of Dada
should be to counter the misinformation disseminated by the press by
representing all the brutality of contemporary circumstances. Grosz's
attitude to the press was confirmed by his inclusion in a later
painting, <I>Pillars of Society</I> , of a newspaper editor
depicted alongside other instigators of the bloody repression of the
German revolution such as the clergy and the military. Once again the
banner of the <I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> was prominently featured.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference in attitude between Grosz and Baader to the mass media
is indicative of the divide between the politically committed wing
of the Berlin Dada group and its rather more anarchic side. By 1920
Richard Huelsenbeck, the erstwhile leader of the Berlin Dadas, had
become distinctly irritated by Baader's self publicizing antics and
was almost certainly responsible for the stinging attack in the <I>Dada
Almanach</I>, where he described him as "a comfort-loving Swabian pastor
or petit bourgeois [who] attempts to exploit his mania for godliness
simply in order to line his pocket."
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 He continued this line of criticism in his later memoirs where he again
 disparaged Baader's "psychotic exhibitionism," calling him "an itinerant
 preacher, the Billy Graham of his time, a mixture of Anabaptist and
 circus owner."
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 However, Stephen Foster finds Baader's dadaism to be more radical than
 that of Grosz in that he attempted to find "an extracultural position
 from which to speak."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 This, Foster contrasts to Grosz's "more orthodox politicizing" which
 did not challenge the accepted roles of art and literature but merely
 used them in a satirical fashion. How Grosz responded to the inclusion
 of his own cover for the journal <I>Die Pleite</I>, exhibited at
 the summit of the <I>Plasto-Dio- Dada-Drama</I>, is unrecorded (<A
 HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader's engagement with the role of the media in the construction
of reality has one final arcane reference in the assemblage. Having
transformed the Dada montage principle from a two- to a three-dimensional
experience, the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> alludes in its title to
the diorama, a form of spectacular entertainment invented in the early
nineteenth century which had been conceived by Daguerre as a challenge
to the then quite common panorama. Daguerre took the panorama's concern
for illusion or fidelity to nature and added the excitement of witnessing
a scene apparently unfolding in real time. Through clever backlighting
of a transparent painting, the spectator could enjoy "the many momentary
changes of mood which he knew so well from nature--from the hazy morning
to the clear light and from the calm beauty of a sunny day to the brooding
and stormy sky."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The "performance" of an image would last approximately fifteen minutes,
 and the audience was seated on a revolving platform so that

<B></B>

they could be turned to view a second scenario. In 1834, Daguerre devised
the "double-effect" diorama, where not only could changing light effects
be produced but, with the use of certain filters, res could be
made to appear in the scene who had at first been invisible. The craze
for such entertainment spread to London and also to Germany. The Berlin
diorama developed in a rather extraordinary way with the emergence of the
Pleorama, a kind of moving panorama. The designers of this attraction,
Carl Wilhelm Gropius and Gottfried Langhans, the latter the architect of
the Brandenburg Gate, seated the audience in a ship and took them on a
small "voyage." As Helmut Gernsheim records, "the illusion of movement
was achieved by the back-cloth slowly traversing the stage, giving the
impression of a moving viewpoint on the part of the spectator."
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While these forms of moving narrative unfolding in time seem extremely
pertinent to the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, it is difficult to
judge what knowledge Baader may have had of them, as the diorama did
not survive much past 1850. The term has remained in common use,
especially in English, to describe any form of illusionary model
against a backdrop. German dictionaries are far less promiscuous with
their definition of the term, limiting it to either the illusionistic
show devised by Daguerre or to the building which might have housed
such an event. The Berlin diorama was in fact situated in a grand
building designed by Schinkel at the intersection of Georgenstrasse
and Universit&auml;tstrasse, midway between Friedrichstrasse and the
<I>Museum-Insel</I>directly along the route through which the railway
was driven.It is tempting to interpret this as yet another reference by
Baader to the actual topography of the city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, as Jonathan Crary has noted, the transition from the panorama
to the diorama is a key moment in the creation of the modern spectator.
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 No sooner had the panorama broken with the traditional perspectival
 box and created a new ambulatory audience, than the diorama
 removed this freedom of movement, placing the seated viewers in
 front of a screen on which movement was depicted. Walter Benjamin's
 description of such spectacles in his notes for <I>Paris Capital of the
 Nineteenth-Century</I> conflates the two forms, a product it seems of
 his ambivalence regarding the active or passive roles adopted by the
 cinema audience.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The dominant mode of distraction, which he identifies as the effect of
 the modernization of vision, had its parallel for him in Dada montage
 techniques. As early as 1920, Hausmann had claimed that he was producing
 a kind of cinema, and the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> does have the
 feel of a strangely inverted panorama. Instead of the spectator placed
 at the center of the world, turning to view the scene all around him,
 he now circles around an object which has attempted to collect a whole
 world in itself.

With the idea of the diorama as a scenographic unfolding narrative in
mind, we can now turn to the second main narrative which Baader invited
the audience to read into the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, namely his
autobiography. What I wish to pursue further now are the ways in which
this autobiography would have been understood within

<B></B>

the longstanding German tradition of the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, a
fictionalized account of the development of a subject in connection to a
cultural education. The <I>Fantastic Life of the Superdada</I> did indeed
mention a key text in this tradition, Goethe's <I>Italian Journey</I>,
a diary recording the famous author's grand tour of Italy and assimilation
of classical culture. Goethe appears in the text at the start of the third
story where he "arrives in Weimar, lays his <I>Italian Journey</I> on
teacher Hagendorf's lectern and tells the Swabian pastor [Baader himself]:
'One cannot understand a word of literature without this lectern.'"
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first part of <I>Italian Journey</I> was originally published as
an appendix to Goethe's autobiography <I>Dichtung und Wahrheit</I>
(<I>Poetry and Truth</I>) and was then reprinted several times
independently. It functions as an interesting model for Baader in that
it combined travelogue with an account of personal development and
education. We have already noted how the cultural pretensions of the
Wilhelmine empire and its museum building programme are mocked in the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, how "the museum of masterpieces through
the ages" is something that Baader depicts himself as passing through,
and how Baader uses a reproduction of a Flemish masterpiece from the
Kaiser Friedrich Museum. Goethe's <I>Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</I>
(<I>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</I>), which founded the tradition of
the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, dealt with the artistic training of a young man
through his appreciation of the art of the past. In fact, Goethe began
to write this novel while on his Italian trip, and its development is
recorded in his diary entries, leading to an intriguing conflation of
his personality with that of Wilhelm Meister and both their simultaneous
cultural educations. This was taken up by successive imitators, such as
Ludwig Tieck's <I>Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen(The Wanderings of Franz
Sternbald</I>), which again combined travelogue with the study of Italian
and Flemish masters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An anecdote told by Raoul Hausmann reveals Baader's interest in another
very particular version of the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, Gottfried Keller's
<I>Der Gr&uuml;ne Heinrich</I>(<I>Green Henry</I>). Walking along the
street together one day in summer 1918, Baader suddenly informed him that
it was Keller's one hundredth birthday. Hausmann continues: "I made up my
mind at once. 'Have you got anything by Keller on you?' 'Yes, I've got
<I>Green Henry</I>.' 'Good, let's celebrate.'" Standing in the middle
of the street, the two proceeded to take turns to read from the book
"at random and read scraps of sentences with no beginning and no end,
changing our voices . . . leafing backward and forward, spontaneously."
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Performing a typical dada subversion of sense, the two transformed the
 text into a form of sound poetry. The logic of the life described in the
 novel as an emotional and intellectual development was metamorphosed
 into a haphazard chain of accidents. But the text they were using was
 not only a classic <I>Bildungsroman</I>, it was also known to be again
 a thinly veiled autobiography on Keller's part. Running to four volumes
 it included all kinds of material drawn from the author's own life,
 not all of which was flattering. The novel details the ambitions of an
 artist whose quest for fame destroys his family, a story that strangely
 parallelled Baader's own neglect of his wife and children. Just as with
 his attitude to the press, Baader was ever reluctant to draw the line
 between fiction and reality.

<B></B>

In the context of the negative <I>Bildungsroman</I> that the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was, it is important to note that Baader
had experienced traumatic losses of selfhood, none more painful than
his persistent identification with the re of Christ. Although he
is perhaps the only dadaist to have been actually certified insane,
I do not wish to undertake a retrospective diagnosis of him through
his work or normalize his personality by matching it to a recognized
psychiatric condition. His testing of the boundaries of personality is
far more interesting as a cultural phenomenon and should be considered
alongside Dada's broader examination of the modern subject. In
the assemblage, Baader used a typical Dada motif in the image of
the mannequin or dummy which stands in for himself and holds the re "2" in its right hand. Mannequins
frequently appear in Dada imagery as metaphors for the rejection of
the expressionist concern for the uniqueness of the individual; they
register the dehumanizing effects of industrial society, or they signify
aspirations to what Michael Hays has called a post-humanist subjectivity.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama,</I> the mannequin features at the end
 of the second story, described in the text as "The Metaphysical Test,"
 where Baader finds himself "violated by Platonic ideas." He is rescued
 only by the appearance of "Herr von M&uuml;nchausen's beanstalk,"
 via which he climbs to the next story. In Baader's biography, this
 is the moment he published his first book, the <I>Fourteen Letters of
 Christ</I>, written in the form of a series of letters to eminent people
 signed by himself as Christ. A copy of the book is described as included
 somewhere in the lower section of the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>,
 although it is not visible in the photographs. Significantly, he reused
 an image of the very same mannequin for a 1920 photomontage, <I>The
 Author of the Book "The Fourteen Letters of Christ" in his Home</I>. The
 outcome of "The Metaphysical Test" is the rejection of a metaphysical
 separation of the real from the apparent along with the notion of a
 stable subjectivity. The result for the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>
 is that it cannot be seen as a self portrait so much as Baader's self-
 construction. There is no real Johannes Baader beyond the assemblage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One final important piece of autobiographical writing should be mentioned
here which again contested the construction of the subject formulated
by the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, namely Nietzsche's <I>Ecce Homo</I>. Both
Baader and his closest associate in the Dada group, Raoul Hausmann,
were enthusiastic readers of Nietzsche, and the latter is known to have
owned a copy of <I>Ecce Homo</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
The text proposes itself as a reflection back on the philosopher's life
and career giving short accounts of all his books prefaced by sections
titled "Why I am so Wise," "Why I am so Clever," and "Why I Write such
Excellent Books." It is immediately obvious that Baader's <I>Fantastic
Lifestory of the Superdada</I> follows certain traits of <I>Ecce
Homo</I><I>.</I> In the early sections of <I>Ecce Homo</I>, Nietzsche
relates his family history and childhood to the political life of Germany,
such as sharing his birthday and name with King Friedrich Wilhelm IV
of Prussia. In the opening sections of the text, Nietzsche also makes
clear that his life story is as much one of decline as progress. He casts
himself as a decadent, a <I>Doppelg&auml;nger</I> with at least two faces:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> integrates both ascent and decline
in its ostensible subject matter: the fall of the German empire, and
the rise of the Superdada. It also makes use of the spiral form curving
around the tower or pyramid structure to signify these two movements. At
the summit stands the banner of <I>Die Pleite</I>, but we are asked
to imagine the cylinder revolving endlessly into the ether. Baader
found a form to accommodate the dual movements present in Nietzsche's
philosophy; the linear passage from man to superman, and the cycle
of eternal recurrence. The first term takes an evolutionary model,
the second a circular one. The spiral, as movement without progress,
fits perfectly with the antirational nature of this dynamic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Thus Spake Zarathustra</I>, Nietzsche introduced eternal
recurrence as a deconstruction of idealist interpretations of history as
teleology. Central to the same book is the doctrine of the superman as
destiny of mankind. How the two might be compatible has created problems
in Nietzsche scholarship ever since. However, in the prologue to the
book, Nietzsche has Zarathustra state quite clearly that the passage to
the superman is both a "going-across" and a "down-going."
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Similarly, eternal recurrence has no status in Nietzsche's writings as a
 cosmological explanation of existence. Rather, he is interested in the
 psychological burden of repetition. These notions are red in the
 <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> by the express train "erroneously misled
 by an assumption of an ever-unfolding future" and, in the second story,
 "the wheel of events (for furthering the transformation of the round
 by means of new lives--albeit still tied to the wheel)."
<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader was not alone in using the spiral as a re for the active
nihilism summoned up by Nietzsche's thinking. The architect Henry van
de Velde was commissioned by Elisabeth F&ouml;rster-Nietzsche to build
the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar in 1902-1903, and he spent the next
years devising plans for a Nietzsche temple and monument for the same
location. One of the surviving drawings shows how he planned to use
a section of <I>Thus Spake Zarathustra</I> entitled <I>The Way of the
Creator</I> as an inscription on the monument, a text which praises the
solitary artist who places himself above the law, beyond good and evil:
"Are you a new strength and a new right? A first motion? A self-propelling
wheel? Can you also compel stars to revolve around you."
<SUP><A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The only decorative element van de Velde conceived for the monument
 was the inscribed motif of a spiral on a square base expressing the
 movement described in the text which is, once again, dynamic without
 being progressive. The significance of the number five for the stories
 of the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> is that the spectator is lead around
 the square base and returns to the side where he began.

A few commentators on the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I> have made the
connection between it and Baader's earlier career as an architect who
specialized in mausoleums

<B></B>

and funereal architecture.
<SUP><A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 As noted earlier, the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I> was to be considered
 "Dada monumental architecture" and it contained numerous references to
 recent building programs in Berlin. The image of a tower or pyramid that
 it conjures up is very much connected to his earlier visionary projects
 such as the <I>Cosmic Temple Pyramid</I> which he planned in 1906 (<A
 HREF="8.4white_9.html"> 9</A>). This unfeasible construction of
 colossal size (1000m wide at the base and 1500m high) was to contain
 "free universities, libraries and archives, modern world museums and
 world collections, arenas and plazas for international games, music
 festivals and dramas, public parks, pilgrimage centers, garden cities,
 and villas and gardens and forests and fields and mountains and meadows
 and steams and lakes and rivers and the sea."
<SUP><A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The pyramid was the ultimate collection of world culture and knowledge,
 a <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I> of astonishing ambition. It was also, as Baader
 conceded, "a new Tower of Babel," an image I would suggest is preserved
 in the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I><I>.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader's response to modern architecture appears to have been drawn
largely from the satirical writer Paul Scheerbart. From the 1890s onwards,
Scheerbart had been developing in his blackly comic novels the image of
a new fantastic architecture of color and glass. Combining apocalyptic
with utopian themes, he dreamt of crystal palaces set on mountain tops
constructed through the force of sheer genius. He appears in Baader's text
in the third story: "Paul Scheerbart pulls up in a coach of crystal and
lies down--as a bomb--beside the dusty crate of architecture," possibly
a reference to

<B></B>

Scheerbart's death in 1915.
<SUP><A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Baader is reputed to have known him well, and it is likely that he was
 mimicking the megalomaniacal characters of Scheerbart's novels when he
 appointed himself President of the Globe.
<SUP><A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Scheerbart had also come up with the vision of the Earth as a star,
 <I>Der Stern Erde</I>, which Baader used in his later cosmologies. Baader
 also took over Scheerbart's adoption of a monistic philosophy and
 rejection of the Christian explanation of death, an idea which has
 interesting implications for the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>. As
 mentioned before, the fifth story is not conceived by Baader as the end
 of the narrative. Above it he imagines the cylinder soaring into the
 sky from which he broadcasts "into the ether the final redemption from
 suffering and death." The spiral form of the assemblage is important
 for developing its energy to continue ever upwards, spinning by force
 of its own momentum. The inspiration for this idea may well have been
 derived from Scheerbart's 1910 novel <I>Das Perpetuum Mobile</I>, which
 recounts in first person form the attempts of its narrator to invent a
 machine which conserves all of its energy and keeps moving eternally. As
 he steadily approaches bankruptcy, the narrator fantasizes more and more
 on the potential of such a device to solve all the world's problems,
 but also to conquer death as we know it, finally introducing the image
 of the Earth Star as the ultimate perpetuum mobile.
<SUP><A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Hanne Bergius, in her account of Baader's family history, tells us that
 his father was a carpenter who went bankrupt in 1891 after neglecting
 his work in favor of trying to build a similar device. Once again we
 are faced with a blurring of the lines between reality and fiction, as
 Scheerbart could have taken the plot of his book from Baader's own life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, it has not gone unnoticed that the form of the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> bears an uncanny similarity to Tatlin's
<I>Monument to the Third International</I>, both in its tower form and the
dynamic rotational aspect. There is no evidence to suggest that Baader may
have seen a photograph of the model that Tatlin had recently completed,
but a written description of Tatlin's project had been published in
Germany shortly before the opening of the Dada Fair. Konstantin Umanskij's
<I>Neue Kunst in Russland1914-1919</I> has long been acknowledged
as the source for the placard displayed at the fair of "Die Kunst ist
tot--Es lebe die neue Maschinenkunst Tatlins" ("Art is dead--long live
Tatlin's new machine art"), but the text also commented on the enormous
scale of Tatlin's project and his plans for it to contain a radio station,
cinemas, telegraph and space for art exhibitions.

 <IMG ALT=""#660066" re 10. " ALIGN="LEFT"
 SRC="button/8.4white_0b.gif"> </A>

The synchronicity between Baader and Tatlin may also be explained by
their common adoption of the Eiffel Tower as image of modern engineering
and architectural ambition. While this may be rather more literal in
Tatlin's case, it is interesting to note Baader's incorportation of
Henri Rousseau's <I>Self-Portrait</I> into the collage <I>Club der Blauen
Milchstrasse</I> of 1920 (<A HREF="8.4white_0.html"> 10</A>).
<SUP><A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Here, Raoul Hausmann's face has been inserted in place of Rousseau's
 and the famous background, which included the Eiffel Tower, has been
 partially covered over by Baader's leaflet protesting against the
 constitution of the Weimar republic and declaring himself President
 of the Globe. Also included in the collage is a reproduction of the
 <I>Cosmic Temple Pyramid</I> in the top left hand corner, and in the
 lower right a flyer explaining the significance of the <I>Handbuch</I> 

<B></B>

<I>des Oberdadaismus</I>, Baader's version of the Bible. On the right
of the collage, emanating from behind Hausmann/Rousseau, and where we
would have originally seen the Eiffel Tower, is a cone reaching up into
the heavens and to a cosmological ying/yang symbol. In the same way that
Tatlin attempted to make the <I>Monument to the Third International</I>
calendric and astronomically aligned, both he and Baader produced readings
of the Eiffel Tower that were thoroughly utopian rather than concerned for
the practical engineering possibilities. This was to be architecture that
could relieve mankind from the alienation of urban life by reconnecting
it to the cosmos rather than increase its disempowerment in the face
of technology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, as we trace the passage of communication in the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> from phonetics to journalism, we should
not forget the aerial at the summit that would transform these words
into radio signals that could be broadcast into the ether. The Eiffel
Tower was used in its earliest years for meteorological experiments and
as a giant aerial. Tatlin took up the theme to suggest that the message
of international communism could be broadcast from his colossal tower
across otherwise insurmountable boundaries. If Baader's monument is
viewed as a pyramid and his background as a designer of mausoleums is
borne in mind, then it may be that the route of the spiral is meant
to suggest the transformation of matter into invisible energy. Given
that we have been obliged to consider this as Baader's autobiography,
the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> becomes a tomb which will preserve
his presence after his death. However, its ephemeral nature contradicts
everything that a tomb should be; instead we

<B></B>

are left with the conclusion that Baader is commenting on his own
transformation into a trail of newspaper headlines, into a set of
references in the media--into what he has in fact become almost half a
century after his death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have clearly seen that beyond its reputation as the
largest, most audacious assemblage of the 1920 Dada Fair, the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was also an object loaded with meaning
rather than the unintelligible heap it has previously been taken
to be. Moreover, it was aimed at a very particular urban audience,
the tabloid reading Berliner, and used visual strategies adopted from
montage that related very specifically to the presentation of narrative
in new media such as film. Spatial and temporal narratives connected the
assemblage to the topography of the city center and represented the manner
in which the contemporary subject navigated it. Most importantly, the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> presented itself a <I>perpetuum mobile</I>
not because it actually moved, but because it was projected into the
future as an object through which Baader would be remembered. If the
main message of the Dada Fair has been read until now as the death of
art, the staging of the death of the author and his resurrection as a
media construction which Baader enacted through this assemblage will
ultimately be seen as far more radical.

"Der Weltkrieg ist ein Krieg der Zeitungen. In Wirklichkeit hat er niemals
existiert" ("DGUU," 94). Baader's attitude to the press could well have
been derived from Oswald Spengler. In <I>The Decline of the West</I>,
Spengler discussed the parallels between military and communications
technology, concluding that: "Now the <I>press campaign</I> appears as
the prolongation--or the preparation--of war by other means, and in
the course of the nineteenth century the strategy of outpost ts,
feints, surprises, assaults, is developed to such a degree that a war
may be lost ere the first shot is fired--because the Press has won it
meantime." Oswald Spengler, <I>The Decline of the West, volume two:

1959), 461. See also note 29 below.

In the notes accompanying the recently translated version of the <I>Dada
Almanach</I> it is suggested that the division into five stories parodies
"Spengler's <I>Decline of the West</I>, in which the history of mankind
is divided into five developmental stages." (Malcolm Green, ed., <I>Dada
Almanac</I> [London: Atlas Press, 1993], 98). I am certain that Spengler
is one of Baader's reference points but <I>The Decline of the West</I>
uses period divisions of four (world history as the seasons) or three
(preculture, culture and civilization).

The montage of Hausmann's face onto Rousseau's <I>Self-Portrait</I> was
first carried out by John Heartfield and George Grosz in 1920 which they
titled <I>Corrected Self-Portrait</I>. It is one of a series of games
concerning authorship amongst the Berlin Dadas at the time. Hausmann
was himself responsible for using Grosz's profile for the montage <I>The
Art Critic</I>, also of 1920, which was then stamped with Grosz's name
into the bargain. The reappropriation of Grosz and Heartfield's montage
by Baader further complicates the issue.
