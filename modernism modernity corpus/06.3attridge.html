It may be a legal or a theological fiction (as Joyce would probably have
insisted), but the impending millennial changeover seems to encourage
the asking of large questions and the taking of long views. This essay
will be an instance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The imminent end of what we think of as "our" millennium also seems to
breed surveys and polls, and few readers of daily newspapers can have
escaped seeing one or more lists of "best books" or "most important
authors" in which James Joyce and his works re prominently. Among
the large questions I find myself asking at this transitional moment
are: "What is the significance of Joyce's emergence as the preeminent
literary re of the twentieth century and one of the most admired
artists of the second millennium? And in the face of this pre-eminence,
what are the responsibilities of those who are professionally involved
with Joyce as we look ahead to a new era?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When one is starting on a career as a scholar and critic, it's a common
mistake, and perhaps even a necessary one, to think of one's work as
leading, together with the work of one's colleagues, to a solid edifice
which will stand as a firm and unchanging basis for further scholarly
and critical building projects. Each stage in this process, one assumes,
will lead the scholarly community closer to the goal of full and final
exegesis together with textual stability and historico-biographical
certainty. From this perspective on critical practice, the massive
accumulation of commentary on Joyce can only be dispiriting:

<B></B>

 after the deployment of so much skill and the expenditure of so
 much effort, surely we should be approaching something like a full
 understanding and appreciation of his work. The avalanche of books
 and articles should be slowing down as unexplored areas become fewer,
 explications more accurate, critical judgments sounder. But the very
 opposite seems to be happening.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are several reasons for this. One is the fact that, although
the number of different commentaries on Joyce seems bewilderingly
large, it's only a tiny proportion of the <I>potential</I> number. Even
works significantly less complex than Joyce's allow of a huge variety
of critical responses. We like to think that, because there are so
many books on Joyce on our library shelves, there has been a logical
progression whereby important topics have been systematically covered
and gaps gradually filled; but in fact authors' choices of subject
and editors' and publishers' decisions about publication are in large
measure the product of pressures and contingencies that have nothing
to do with intellectual or cultural need. Think how many biographies
of Joyce <I>could</I> be written, each quite different from the last;
how many editions of each of his books could  be produced; how
many textual details could be explored, how many critical approaches
employed, how many intertextual and historical connections drawn. The
graduate student embarking on a dissertation on Joyce is likely to survey
the array of secondary literature and feel despairingly that there is
nothing left to be done. What we actually have, however, is a small,
and rather random, selection of what is possible according to current
canons of critical activity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A second reason why the model of a closer and closer approach to full
understanding is not appropriate is that it fails to take the essentially
temporal and spatial nature of the cultural field into account. That is,
the meaning and value of a cultural object--such as <I>Ulysses</I>--is a
product of that object's interaction with a specific cultural matrix,
and cultural matrices vary across time and space. The consequence
is that Joyce's works, like any artefacts sufficiently rich in their
relations to their constituting context, can never be exhausted: after
a certain measure of time (in a given place), the object is no longer
the same object, and commentary has a new task. In fulfilling its
new task, commentary also helps to constitute the object in its new
form. The humanist <I>Ulysses</I> is partly displaced by the formalist
<I>Ulysses</I>, the poststructuralist <I>Ulysses</I>, the new historicist
<I>Ulysses</I>, the postcolonial <I>Ulysses</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I say "partly displaced" because we are not dealing with a succession of
quite differently constituted works; the sedimented history of readings
often persists in its effects, complicating and sometimes enriching
current readings. An interpretation of <I>Ulysses</I> that can be said
to do justice to it in the specific context of the late twentieth century
will be alert to its engagement with Ireland's history as a metropolitan
colony, but will also take account of its destabilization of the norms
of Enlightenment thinking, its formal intricacy, and its convincing
representation of the inner lives of human characters. However, working
against this survival of past modes of commentary is a third factor that
prolongs the critical endeavor: the ease with which we forget what has
been written, and write it over and over again, using a newer vocabulary
to articulate the same insights. Because the library of Joyce criticism
is so vast, there is very

<B></B>

little chance that a critic writing today will track down
<I>everything</I> that has been said on his or her chosen topic; and
as the critical history grows longer and longer, the opportunities for
recycling increase.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fourth and final factor behind the increasing productivity of Joyce
criticism that I want to mention is a simple but often overlooked truth:
the more that is written about a topic, the more there is to write. Every
fact invites a further exploration, every judgment a counter-judgment. Not
long after Joyce has become a topic for critical writing, Joyce criticism
becomes a topic. If the avalanche ever subsides, it will not happen
because there is less to say about Joyce and what has been made of
Joyce. On the contrary, there is more and more to say about Joyce every
year because more has been said--more to build on, more to disagree with.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new millennium is not likely to bring a diminishment in the quantity
of books and articles on Joyce, then. Much of the huge potential for
commentary will remain to be tapped; cultural and historical shifts
will permit hitherto unforeseen ways of reading; older readings will
be forgotten and repeated in new guises; and the mass of existing
texts about Joyce, in conjunction with the increasing availability of
original documents, will provoke further texts, which in their turn will
provoke yet more. There is not much substance to the argument that Joyce
criticism has virtually exhausted its topic, and that it is time to turn
to other things. If it is true that downsizing would be appropriate in
the Joyce industry, it's not because of an imminent drying up of supply
or of demand.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When I look back over my own writings on Joyce during the past seventeen
years or so, I'm struck by their uniformly positive assessment of
Joyce's achievement. Everything I've written rests on the same basis: the
assumption that Joyce's writing is to be enjoyed, admired, and learned
from rather than weighed in evaluative scales and pronounced good, bad,
or a mixture of the two. I'm not unusual in this; almost everything that
has been published on Joyce during the same period has proceeded on its
business of interpretative exegesis, historical mapping, biographical
exploration, pre-textual investigation, political commentary, or whatever
it might be, without seeing any reason for questioning the fundamental
proposition that Joyce's work is a fully achieved artistic success and
a highly valuable contribution to our cultural life, and often our moral
and political life as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 (I'll return in due course to some exceptions.) I don't believe this is
 just a story of uncritical adulation; what I want to suggest is that it
 is, at least in many cases, the product of a certain kind of critical
 responsibility, responsibility to and for Joyce, or, more accurately,
 Joyce's work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responsibility, if it is to mean anything other than conformity to an
existing moral code, is responsibility to and for <I>the other</I>;
that is to say, the experience of obligation to that which one does not
and cannot fully know. To act ethically is to respond with justice to
the other, and this involves <I>both</I> a careful weighing up of the
evidence <I>and</I>

<B></B>

an acknowledgment that the evidence is always inadequate, necessitating
what we might term, after Kierkegaard, a leap of trust in the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 We can only, of course, make this leap if we find ourselves in some way
 summoned by the other, called to respond to it, and much therefore
 remains beyond our conscious control in this process; but it is
 possible to prepare the ground, to develop one's receptivity to what
 might come (though it will still take us by surprise if it is genuinely
 other)--and equally possible to close oneself in advance to the chance
 of the other's arrival. If someone tells me, "I've never been able to
 appreciate Joyce," I'm ready to believe that for substantial reasons
 of individual character, taste, cultural background, and so on, Joyce's
 writing is simply unavailable to that person; but it is always possible
 that part of this response is a failure of openness to an alterity that
 would challenge cherished habits or assumptions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many of the unfailingly positive responses to Joyce's work, then, arise
not from a belief that it is without faults or potentially dangerous
effects but from an initial, and continually sustained, <I>commitment</I>,
one that exceeds any objective assessment of aesthetic, moral, or
political worth. The parallels with the kinds of commitment we make
to other persons or, sometimes, institutions or communities, will be
evident. Normally, there is a built-in safeguard in the knowledge that
others have made and will make different commitments, and will remain
critically alert to all the possible failings in the object of <I>my</I>
commitment; so that, looking at the wider picture, the judgments we all
make ensure that both the potential value and the inevitable limitations
of a wide variety of judgeable entities is registered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But as we approach the year 2000, and we find it possible to say with the
likelihood of a fair measure of agreement from readers in many parts of
the globe, "James Joyce was the most important writer of the twentieth
century," I am forced to wonder if, in this case (and one can think of
a few others), such a process has really happened. Saying good things
about Joyce (or working on Joyce with the implication that he is worth
a great deal of time and effort) has become such a profitable pastime
that it seems to have made it all but impossible for counter-voices to
emerge, or to be heard if they do emerge. At the very least, this may
be the moment for those who are committed to Joyce to think about their
responsibility to other works, other writers. When a body of work has
gained such massive international endorsement, when a single artist is
the subject of such an extensive and meticulous critical enterprise, is it
perhaps not time for critics to direct their energies elsewhere, to look
for other writers who can teach and entertain us in different ways, ways
perhaps more appropriate to the needs of the twenty-first century? This
may be a better reason for downsizing the Joyce industry than the
feeling that there is less and less to be said. If the best readings
of an oeuvre are those that are as responsive to the particularities of
their own time and place as they are to the work itself, it may well be
that the new millennium, or at least the new century and the increasing
globalization of culture that it is sure to bring, require less of James
Joyce and more of a diversity of artists with a variety of backgrounds
operating with different techniques and different aims.

3. Judging Joyce
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My suggestion, then, is that the millennial musings of those of us who
feel committed to Joyce in the way I have described should include
an attempt to stand back from him, to bracket as far as we can our
admiration and enjoyment, and to ask what possible negative consequences
follow from his current preeminence within the cultural arena. We
might, for instance, ask how the current hegemony exerted by his work
matches up to the values embodied in his writing, as we now perceive
them. Don't the comic deflations of <I>Ulysses</I> and <I>Finnegans
Wake</I> have a bearing on the eminently serious endeavors of Joyce
scholars and editors around the world? How does Joyce's domination of
twentieth-century reading lists square with the sympathy for the underdog
and the suspicion of authority manifested in his writing? Although it's
hard to imagine Joyce himself ever being pleased by a move to dislodge
his name from the pinnacle it currently occupies, it could be argued
that his global prominence, and the consequent demotion of a number
of other writers equally worth our attention, constitute a large-scale
instance of the kind of closing off of opportunities that a number of his
works dramatize and derogate. (Think, for instance, of all the lives in
<I>Dubliners</I> that are confined and limited by those in the social
sphere who wield influence and authority). This is one of the oldest
games in the critical book, of course, and one that I have often played:
using the values embodied in Joyce's work (as perceived by the critic)
as a means to expose weaknesses in the approaches of others, including
approaches that, it is claimed, praise Joyce for the wrong reasons.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But such a strategy of displacement, while it would use Joyce's warrant in
order to turn away from Joyce and devote one's energies to other writers,
would still in a sense leave him unchallenged as the preeminent re,
proved yet again to be ahead of his time, foreseeing all our critical
and ethical needs. What is more, the general point that the dominance
of one author results in the occlusion of a number of others tells us
nothing <I>specific</I> about Joyce. Should we not, in assessing Joyce
at the millennium's end, aspire to something more nuanced by way of
critical judgment than the simple cry of <I>Basta!</I>?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another responsibility, I would suggest, is laid upon us. We have to
try to distance ourselves further from our enjoyment and admiration
of Joyce's work and our involvement in the seductive Joycean milieu in
order to ask: are there aspects of Joyce's work that deserve a negative
response? Should the conversation about Joyce in the twenty-first century
be a debate about strengths and weaknesses, benefits and dangers, as are
the conversations about T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, Wyndham
Lewis, and many other modernist writers? In raising these questions, it's
<I>Ulysses</I> we need to focus on, since it's above all on <I>Ulysses</I> that Joyce's reputation rests. Had he written only the earlier
works, he would remain an important twentieth-century re, but he
would not have become the giant we now know. And negative judgments
of <I>Finnegans Wake</I> are not rare; even if there is seldom a word
said against it in the public halls of Joyce symposia these days, there
are many complaints in the corridors. It is, I suspect, largely on the
strength of <I>Ulysses'</I> huge success that the <I>Wake</I> has, at
least in the past two decades, escaped significant onslaughts in print.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a way of initiating the process of judgment, let us ask what have
been the most persistent and telling critiques of <I>Ulysses</I> since
its publication, not in order to parry them but in order to assess
their merit today. (In doing so, we need to set aside at the outset the
numerous objections that have been made on the basis of prudishness,
anti-intellectualism, class bias, religious dogmatism, and other
limiting prejudices or proclivities). We might think of all evaluations
of artistic productions as falling roughly into two categories, though
any final separation between them would be impossible: we can call them
the <I>extra-cultural</I> and the <I>intra-cultural</I>. An extra-cultural
evaluation judges a work by its likely effects on some domain beyond that
of the culture to which it belongs, and is based on the prior acceptance
of certain goals, whether they be religious, moral, or political, which
it is felt any work of art should serve. Intra-cultural evaluations,
by contrast, operate in terms of a standard internal to the cultural
field in which the work is produced and received; in so far as they
are concerned with effects, it is with the effects on the reader in his
or her capacity as reader (rather than as religious believer, artist,
moral or political agent, and so on), and more particularly as literary
reader. (It will no doubt be obvious that I'm putting a lot of weight
on a notoriously murky word, <I>culture</I>, and that I'm doing this
in part, at least, to avoid another murky word, <I>aesthetic</I>. There
isn't time to defend my practice here; suffice it to say that by culture
I mean the ensemble of social practices, productions, and knowledges
within which what has traditionally been called the aesthetic finds
its place, but which embraces much that would be judged unaesthetic, or
anti-aesthetic, by traditional norms).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One strand of extra-cultural critiques derives its general standards
from some variety of Marxism: <I>Ulysses</I> has often been pronounced
too subjectivist and too bourgeois (a pair of related sins) to further
the revolution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The names of Karl Radek and Georg Luk&aacute;cs come to mind;
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 less well-known (and more balanced) are the critiques of Alick West
 in 1937 and Arnold Kettle in 1953.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 "Second-wave" feminism, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
 judging Joyce in terms of his representation of women, sometimes found
 that his writing served to retard progress towards gender equality. Kate
 Millett, Florence Howe, Carolyn Heilbrun, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar,
 and others criticized Joyce for his conventionally sexist attitudes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Such critiques don't, I feel, carry enough weight at our present moment
 to contribute towards an argument about the value of <I>Ulysses</I>. The
 hostile Marxists have been countered by other left-wing critics who
 regard <I>Ulysses</I> as a valuable reflection of a certain stage of
 capitalism (one could cite Franco Moretti's "The Long Goodbye" and
 Fredric Jameson's "<I>Ulysses</I> in History") or who are unapologetic
 about their admiration and enjoyment of the book (Raymond Williams would
 be one example); and the critical feminists have been answered by a large
 number of others who find in Joyce more to admire than to castigate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 There's little evidence that, on the whole, Joyce's work has had a
 harmful effect upon the societies in which it has been widely read,
 nor that it has much potential for harm; and I don't believe this is a
 contentious statement in 1999. (Whether the extra-cultural claims made
 for the potential <I>benefits</I> a careful reading of Joyce can bring
 are all justified--and there have been many,

<B></B>

humanist, socialist, feminist, poststructuralist, postcolonial--is
a different question, which I shall touch on in the last section of
this paper).

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
4. Intra-cultural critiques
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To find a way of judging Joyce that has more bite today, we need
to turn to intra-cultural critiques. An intra-cultural critique, as
I've suggested, attempts to assess the success or failure of the work
by measuring it against some standard deemed to be internal to the
cultural field in which it occurs, most commonly an aesthetic standard
(in earlier periods often labeled <I>taste</I>) but sometimes a broader
one, including--if the cultural field is defined in moral or religious
terms--a moral or religious one. Such standards are, of course, culturally
produced and hence variable (although this fact is not always appreciated
by those who apply them); and a successful work like <I>Ulysses</I> to
some degree (as Wordsworth put it) creates the taste--or perhaps the moral
sense--by which it is judged. I would also argue, with Derrida, that the
"it" that is being assessed is not a permanently self-identical entity
but something more like a repeated event or performance, always changing
as the conditions in which it takes place change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Most intra-cultural judgments of Joyce, like most extra-cultural
 judgments, have been, explicitly or implicitly, positive, whether the
 standard applied has been that of truth to a certain notion of the
 historical condition or of human experience, subtlety and complexity
 of aesthetic ordering, comic effectiveness, or some other measure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the negative evaluations of Joyce on an intra-cultural basis, the
most tenacious and widespread (particularly in relation to the later
works) has been that there is an excess of technique over content,
intellect over feeling, and will over spontaneity. These are closely
enough related to be considered a single objection, responding to
a single tendency in Joyce's text (though manifested in a variety of
ways), and it's this recurrent objection on which I want to focus. Many
of those who find today that they can't read <I>Ulysses</I> with any
real pleasure--and there are many, whatever the polls say--experience
some version of this unease; and many who do enjoy <I>Ulysses</I> can
get nowhere with <I>Finnegans Wake</I> for the same reason. (There are
also those who find most of the later chapters of <I>Ulysses</I>--except
perhaps "Penelope"--a disappointment after the earlier ones, because
Joyce's technical display becomes harder and harder to ignore or justify
in traditional terms.) Some of us relish untangling the delicate threads
Joyce has woven together in the late books, while to others it is an
excruciatingly tedious business, in comparison with the excitement offered
by the insistent onward impulsion in a writer like--to take a name often
proposed in opposition to Joyce--D. H. Lawrence. To some degree this must
be a matter of individual preferences, the product of familial and social
conditioning and perhaps even genetic make-up: sometimes it seems, to
parody W. S. Gilbert, that everyone who's born into the world alive is
either a little Joycean or else a little Lawrentian. (Certainly, when
I was an undergraduate in a fiercely Leavisite English department

<B></B>

in South Africa, I quickly learned to stifle my Joycean tendencies
and to pay homage to Lawrence; but the experience didn't turn me into a
Leavisian or a Lawrentian). If it's the case that some such deeply-rooted
personal predisposition is the real impetus behind a number of elaborate
critical arguments, both negative and positive, there is little we can
do to allow for it, and we have no option but to weigh up those arguments
on their intellectual merits.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first extended critique of <I>Ulysses</I> along these lines is Wyndham
Lewis's, in <I>Time and Western Man</I>, published in 1927. Although
Lewis's overarching argument is that <I>Ulysses</I>, like <I>&Agrave; la
recherche du temps perdu</I>, is, to its great disadvantage, a Bergsonian
"time-book," much of his criticism is directed at the disparity between
elaborate technique and what Lewis sees as banal content. For instance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What stimulates him is <I>ways of doing things</I>, and technical
processes, and not <I>things to be done</I>. Between the various things
to be done he shows a true craftsman's impartiality. He is become so much
a writing specialist that it matters very little to him <I>what</I> he
writes, or what idea or world-view he expresses, so long as he is trying
his hand at this manner and that, and displaying his enjoyable virtuosity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lifeless technique and sterile complexity are also what Leavis finds
objectionable in <I>Ulysses</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It seems plain to me that there is no organic principle determining,
informing, and controlling into a vital whole, the elaborate analogical
structure, the extraordinary variety of technical devices, the attempts
at an exhaustive rendering of consciousness, for which <I>Ulysses</I> is
remarkable, and which got it accepted by a cosmopolitan literary world
as a new start. It is rather, I think, a dead end.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Behind Leavis we may hear his lodestar, Lawrence: "James Joyce bores
me stiff--too terribly would-be and done-on-purpose, utterly without
spontaneity or real life" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Boredom, in fact, is the typical experience of those readers who find
the technical display oppressive: Leavis finds Joyce's "subconscious" (as
exhibited in <I>Finnegans Wake</I>)  "sadly boring"; George Moore
is reported as saying of <I>Ulysses</I> in 1922, "I read a little here
and there, but, oh my God, how bored I got!;" and Jung in 1932 managed
to wax lyrical over the apocalyptic boredom produced in him by the book:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Joyce bores me to tears, but it is a vicious dangerous boredom such as
not even the worst banality could induce. It is the boredom of nature,
the bleak whistling of the wind over the crags of the Hebrides, sunrise
and sunset over the wastes of the Sahara, the roar of the sea.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jung is, however, willing to justify this boredom extra-culturally: for
him, <I>Ulysses</I> acts as a necessary counter to the sentimentality
he feels is rampant everywhere around him, by opposing excess of feeling
with complete absence of feeling. Indeed,

<B></B>

those who are <I>not</I> bored by the book are misreading it, and the
fact that it has gone through ten editions in so many years proves that
such misreading has been very common:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The book must mean something to them, must even reveal something that
they did not know or feel before. They are not infernally bored by it, but
are helped, refreshed, instructed, converted, "restratified." Obviously,
they are thrown into a desirable state of some sort, for otherwise only
the blackest hatred could enable the reader to go through the book from
page 1 to page 735 with attention and without fatal attacks of drowsiness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another early critic of <I>Ulysses</I> who, like Jung, balances blame
with praise is Rebecca West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 She begins the long title essay of <I>The Strange Necessity</I>,
 published in 1928, with an anecdote.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Reading a transparently bad poem of Joyce's one day in Paris, she has
 her earlier suspicions confirmed: "Mr. James Joyce is a great man who
 is entirely without taste" (<I>SN</I>, 15). She goes on to discuss what
 for her is a consequence of this lack of taste: what she calls "the gross
 sentimentality which is his most fundamental error" (<I>SN</I>, 15). This
 may sound like the exact opposite of Jung's complaint; but this is not
 sentimentality in the usual sense. West describes it in terms that by
 now sound familiar: instead of "real creative writing" (<I>SN</I>, 17),
 Joyce's work is willed and calculated. It is governed by narcissism,
 "which inevitably deforms all its products with sentimentality, since the
 self-image which it is the aim of narcissism to create is made not out
 of material that has been imaginatively experienced but out of material
 that has been selected as likely to please others" (<I>SN</I>, 22).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Complaints about excessive technical complexity in <I>Ulysses</I> seem
less prevalent in critical studies of Joyce after the 1930s, perhaps in
part because "Work in Progress" and then <I>Finnegans Wake</I> made the
earlier book seem transparent by comparison, but largely because in the
U.S.A--by this time the source of most serious criticism as it has been
ever since--Joyce's reputation was established and the long project of
elucidation and exegesis (which simply took Joyce's merits for granted)
had begun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The Leavisian inheritance remained powerful in the U.K. and its colonies,
 though the effect of this was not to produce negative critiques so much
 as to inhibit any extended discussion of Joyce. One exception was the
 Australian critic Samuel Goldberg, who attempted a balanced, largely
 Leavisian, evaluation of <I>Ulysses</I> in <I>The Classical Temper</I> in 1961.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Goldberg's admiration is moderated by a distaste for what he calls
 Joyce's "busy ant-like industry" (<I>CT</I>, 300) and his "unintelligent
 intellectuality" (<I>CT</I>, 311); he also cites Lawrence's complaints
 (including "wilfulness" and "lack of emotional spontaneity") with
 approval (<I>CT</I>, 309).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 One of Joyce's limitations as a novelist is "the tendency to
 intellectualize his vital intuitions" (<I>CT</I>, 314). Not surprisingly,
 it is the later chapters such as "Oxen of the Sun" and "Eumaeus" that
 he finds most limited (the latter is "too boring a way of expressing
 boredom" [<I>CT</I>, 258]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Even if we do not find these--or any--chapters of <I>Ulysses</I> boring,
 technically excessive, over-intellectualized, or too much the product
 of the will, critical



responsibility demands that we make an effort to understand these charges,
repeated as they have been over several decades.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final intra-cultural critique of <I>Ulysses</I> on which I want to
focus, and which will help us to assess the relevance of these charges
today, is one of the few published in the last two decades, and to
my mind the most significant of them. Leo Bersani published "Against
<I>Ulysses</I>" in <I>Raritan</I> in 1988 and included it as a chapter
of <I>The Culture of Redemption</I> in 1990.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 One might have expected an essay by a leading cultural critic of our time
 that takes issue with the reputation of Joyce's most highly acclaimed
 work to have initiated an extended discussion in the many organs of
 Joyce criticism, and in books and symposia dedicated to Joyce, but
 there has in fact been very little by way of response.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 No ripples have appeared in the uniformly positive surface of commentary
 on Joyce.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Bersani's essay is essentially intra-cultural in its arguments,
it has an interesting relation to extra-cultural criticism in that it's
part of an argument <I>against</I> the notion that art has the power
to improve the world. Bersani argues that <I>Ulysses'</I> failure lies
in its very claim to authority, its confidence--shared by most Joyce
critics--in its own power to promote the cause of Western culture, the
vast intertext in which it situates itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 So Bersani judges that <I>Ulysses</I> (like every other work of art)
 has <I>no</I> significant potential to heal the world's wounds, and
 that its own faith in the potency of literature is a mark against it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I partly share Bersani's scepticism about the redemptive power of art. I
would not wish to deny that works of art can have powerful effects on the
cultural/ethical/political world, but I would insist on two qualifications
which bring me closer to his position: these potential effects are always
unpredictable (potentiality, in other words, does not imply a latent
instrumentality waiting to be released), and they are always dependent
on readings of the work in question, readings which are themselves
unpredictable. This effective unpredictability I see as constitutive
of art in the western cultural tradition; it is closely related to the
demand for innovation which is inseparable from artistic creation and to
the alterity of the new art-work, or the art-work re-experienced as new.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 If a work of art <I>does</I> have a restorative effect on an individual
 or a culture, it's not an effect that could have been deduced or foretold
 with any certainty by a critic, although a critic's work may have
 been crucial to the particular acts of reading which produced it. The
 important question, then, is not whether <I>Ulysses</I> has had or is
 likely to have certain consequences in the world, but whether Bersani's
 description of it as a work which implies certain claims about those
 consequences is accurate, and if it is, whether the making of those
 claims constitutes a flaw.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of Bersani's difficulties with <I>Ulysses</I> echo the complaints
we have already heard from Lewis, Lawrence, Leavis, and Goldberg. His
depiction of <I>Ulysses</I> as a

<B></B>

conventional novel of character-psychology disguised as an avant-garde
experiment sounds like Lewis. When he calls it "a text to be deciphered
but not read" he sounds like Lawrence and Leavis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 And when he speaks of the "technical machinery" that "obscures our
 view of what is happening" (<I>CR</I>, 156), he himself acknowledges
 Goldberg's study of <I>Ulysses</I> as a "notable expression of this
 complaint" (<I>CR</I>, 226 n. 2). As with many of the readers who
 find the excess of technique a problem, Bersani fails to acknowledge
 the degree to which the book demands a way of reading different from
 that required by most novels, and therefore finds his expectations
 disagreeably thwarted. For instance, he stresses--quite rightly, I
 believe--that part of <I>Ulysses</I>'  lasting popularity rests on
 the intimacy with which readers feel they come to know Stephen, Molly,
 and Leopold, but he assumes that this must mean that stylistic features
 serve as reflexes of character in an entirely conventional manner. The
 deformed names in "Scylla and Charybdis," he suggests, arise because
 Stephen is playing with them in his mind; the style of "Eumaeus" is how
 Bloom would write the chapter, and provides us with a fuller picture of
 his personality. Whatever credence one might give to these particular
 examples (I'm not at all convinced by them), they imply a way of reading
 the stylistic peculiarities of <I>Ulysses</I> that is bound to produce
 confusion and frustration. What the best readings of the book over the
 past twenty years have taught us is that it is perfectly possible to
 enjoy the credible minutiae of individual personality and the sense of
 intimacy they produce without assuming an organic relation between style
 and character. Joyce's technical extravagances, and the pleasures they
 offer the reader, are not wholly concerned with accurate portrayals
 of people we might meet; without compromising that accuracy, they
 provide insights--very often comic insights--into the very processes
 of linguistic representation, historical reporting, psychological
 theorizing, political programming, and so on.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A related issue is that of the phenomenology of the reading experience:
critics like Lawrence, Leavis, Goldberg, and Bersani like to be carried
forward in linear fashion by the words they are reading, the elements
of their intellectual and emotional apprehension working together
in an illusion of continuity and wholeness. <I>Ulysses</I> holds
up this preference for inspection, as only one of a number of ways
of reading; and those who are able to take pleasure in tracking back
and forth, skipping and re-reading, moving from text to reference book
and back to text, sharing partial insights with a group and having them
disconfirmed or extended, and simultaneously registering the vividness of
the reality represented <I>and</I> the comic exposure of the subterfuges
of representation, are bound to derive a great deal more from Joyce's
writing. Not surprisingly, Bersani finds the "Ithaca" episode barely
readable--and it <I>is</I> barely readable by the mode of verbal ingestion
he prefers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Notwithstanding these limitations in his approach, I believe that
Bersani's critique points us towards an aspect of <I>Ulysses</I> that
should at least make us hesitate before we exultantly carry it into the
third millennium as the supreme literary text of our time. Particularly
useful is his recognition--implicit if not explicit--that it is not
<I>Ulysses</I> itself (if there were such a thing) to which he is saying
a regretful farewell, but



<I>Ulysses</I> as it has been produced by its readers and their changing
cultural matrix over the past seventy-seven years. As I have been arguing,
the <I>Ulysses</I> which we are trying to evaluate in this way is not
the book that appeared in 1922, or the book that upset Lewis in 1927 and
appalled Jung in 1932, or even the book Goldberg tried to evaluate in
1961. Thanks to the amassed achievements of Joyce critics over several
decades in response to the features that disturbed these critics, the
<I>Ulysses</I> of 1999 is something different: a dense encyclopedic
hypertextual web of internal cross-references, historical and cultural
allusions, and authorial emendations and accretions, existing not as an
isolated linguistic and material entity but as a borderless presence
within a continuous expanse of signifiers, visual and aural, textual
and graphic, substantial and electronic. Before very long, we (or our
wealthier libraries) will be able to purchase a magnificent embodiment
of this evolved entity (no longer a "book," let alone a "novel"): a
hypermedia <I>Ulysses</I> which, it is promised, will include "several
versions" of the text, definitions, annotations, source works ("such
as <I>The Odyssey</I> and <I>Hamlet</I>"), Joyce's schemas, an archive
of critical books and articles linked to specific textual sites, maps,
photographs, film clips, songs and sound effects, and a complete audio
performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 To read <I>Ulysses</I> today as primarily a novel of character
 and event is to read it against its history, against what it has
 become. Although Bersani begins his essay by proposing to approach
 <I>Ulysses</I> "naively," he quickly, and correctly, adds that "this
 decision can be little more than a ruse" (<I>CR</I>, 155). And at
 the end of the essay he ascribes the erroneous ascription to art of
 redemptive power not to Joyce's book on its own but to "the community
 of <I>Ulysses</I> and its exegetes" (<I>CR</I>, 178).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although for many of us this historical transformation of <I>Ulysses</I> into a rich, unhierarchical, unboundaried, intertextual fabric has
enhanced, rather than diminished, its enjoyability, it may be just this
that has rendered Joyce's work less worth our attention as critics. This
is not, as I pointed out earlier, because we are left with less to do
than earlier critics, but because the hypertextualizing of <I>Ulysses</I>
has diminished the force of the book that exploded upon the cultural
stage in 1922, and has made our task a very different one. What those
earlier hostile critics were reporting on was <I>Ulysses</I>' otherness,
its refusal to be assimilated to existing cultural norms, its powerful
resistance to the most strenuous interpretative efforts. Many readers
quickly gave up; some, like Lewis, Jung, and West, worried away at it
even though they had at best very mixed views of what it was doing; and
some glimpsed through the intensity of their engagement a new future
for literature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Bersani is registering in his essay, on the other hand, for
all its echoing of earlier comments, is a problem that exists in the
present, thanks to the highly successful labors of the Joyce industry: an
excessively cosy relation between Joyce's text and the cultural envelope
within which it finds its meanings. Western culture, he comments, "dies
in the Joycean parody and pastiche, but, once removed from historical
time, it is resurrected as a timeless design. Far from contesting the
authority of culture, <I>Ulysses</I> reinvents our relation to Western
culture in terms of exegetical devotion, that is, as the exegesis of
<I>Ulysses</I> itself" (<I>CR</I>, 170). In elaborating his case,

<B></B>

Bersani contrasts <I>Ulysses</I> with Flaubert's <I>Bouvard et
P&eacute;cuchet</I> and with the writing of Samuel Beckett. Flaubert,
he writes (and the comment seems equally apt for Beckett), "erases our
cultural memory at the very moment he awakens it." For these writers,
"the textual act of quotation is simultaneously a disqualification of the
citational process" (<I>CR</I>, 163). The work of art "can only exist
in a continuous anxiety about its capacity to sustain itself, perhaps
even to begin itself" (<I>CR</I>, 163). For Joyce, however, "art is
by definition the transcendence of any such anxiety" (<I>CR</I>, 163);
Joyce's intertextuality functions not as an erasure of cultural memory
but as a principle of cultural continuity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am not convinced that the <I>Ulysses</I> of 1922 <I>did</I> function as
a principle of cultural continuity; it was certainly not widely received
as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 But it may be that the <I>Ulysses</I> of 1999 does, that the work
 of exegesis and commentary, allusion-hunting and cross-referencing,
 theoretical and cultural placing, though it has inevitably failed to
 exhaust the text's difficulties, has succeeded only too well in disarming
 it of its alterity and finding a snug cultural home for it. No longer
 a challenge to the way we read and think, it has become a triumphal
 assertion of the scope and integrity of the culture of which it is one
 of the finest monuments. Where earlier readers grappled with page after
 dense page, a great deal of it incomprehensible, we turn to Thornton
 or Gifford, the <I>Bloomsday Book</I> or <I>The Chronicle of Leopold
 and Molly Bloom,</I> to ease our passage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It might be objected that we do not have to read <I>Ulysses</I> in
 this way, through the lens of reference books and exegetical texts, but
 there is certainly great pressure to do so; and there would be something
 disingenuous, as Bersani notes, about pretending they didn't exist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If this account of what I have called the hypertextualized <I>Ulysses</I> is accurate, there is sufficient reason to turn our attention
elsewhere--not merely because it is grabbing the limelight and casting
other worthy books into darkness, but because its cultural supremacy,
and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have
turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties
instead of one that startles and defies us and thus opens new avenues
for thought and pleasure. It now reassures us of our place in what might
otherwise seem a chaotic universe, or it provides a model of coherence
to take refuge in, a satisfying structure where the details all make
sense--or if they don't, we can be confident that one day they will,
thanks to the tireless efforts of a world-wide band of scholars. In so
doing, <I>Ulysses</I> works in concert with the globalizing tendencies of
international capital, which create a spurious sense of rich complexity
by reducing differences and distinctions. Even readers who are out of
sympathy with its non-linear, highly mediated narrative and stylistic
procedures, such as Bersani, respond to it not as a profound challenge
to their assumptions and beliefs but, thanks to the availability of
a mass of helpful criticism, as a dismissable intellectual exercise,
smugly sure of its honored place in the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this is only one possible outlook for <I>Ulysses</I>. In my
own writing on Joyce's work I have tried to preserve, or rather find
new ways of producing, its difficulty and strangeness, its resistance
to what is habitual and shallow in our cultural

<B></B>

practices, and a number of critics are continuing to work valuably in
this vein (although it must be said that there are now other texts and
other writers who lend themselves more fully to this type of project--one
of whom, as Bersani appreciates, is Beckett). The future may hold new
modes of response to Joyce which will transform his works into challenges
once more.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Criticism and literary history that, rather than focusing on Joyce,
 examines his work in the context of its time (including the context
 of Ireland's colonial subjection) may continue to throw up fresh and
 provocative insights. The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean
 hypertext can itself be unsettling, as Derrida has remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 And it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <I>Ulysses</I> that is anything but reassuring, and that revives, in new ways,
 the provocations and disturbances of the original publication. That
 there are (at least) two such projects in progress is all to the good,
 in reducing the risk of monumentality and in demonstrating, by the
 inevitable differences between the two productions, the contingency
 and incompleteness at work in even the most ambitious critical projects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is another recent development that holds out the possibility of a
newly defamiliarized <I>Ulysses</I>, one that will challenge its readers
in ways that we cannot entirely foresee and that will truly belong to the
third millennium. If you open one of the many institutional and personal
sites devoted to Joyce on the World Wide Web, you enter a hyperspatial
network of Joycean links without anything like the packaged security of a
university press CD-ROM or DVD. Each of these sites gives you the option
of moving to several other sites, which in their turn present you with
further options for retrieving Joycean and para-, sub-, or extra-Joycean
material. This expanding universe of text, sound, and image may be the
closest we can now come to the Joycean spirit that animated the then
unimaginable excesses of the 1922 <I>Ulysses</I>. Just as those early
readers of Joyce's book found it impossible to conceptualize the work
as a whole, baffled by its unprecedented scale, its lack of an obvious
center, and its continuity with a range of nonliterary discourses,
so we encounter an ungraspable electronic text that is centerless and
borderless, constantly evolving in content and reach, and out of the
controlling hands of any single author or arranger. Add to this the
potential unreliability or irrelevance of any given piece of information
it offers, and its openness to the random, to chance and coincidence,
and you have a text that requires a reader--now too passive a term--who
is an ingenious, energetic participant in the creative process.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And we still have the challenge of <I>Finnegans Wake</I>, which
hardly needs the World Wide Web to make its readers into creative
participants. One can imagine Joyce, having just completed <I>Ulysses</I>,
foreseeing the day when it would no longer make almost impossible demands
on the reader and immediately setting to work on the book that would keep
us baffled into the next millennium. We have no shortage of reference
texts and guides to assist us with the <I>Wake,</I> but as anyone who
has wrestled with a single page knows, these leave unaddressed more
problems than they solve. This is not to deny the extremely valuable
work of exegesis that has helped make Joyce's last book more readable
than could have been imagined fifty years ago, nor the effects of

<B></B>

cultural developments--the tangle of aesthetic, critical, and political
conditions that we term "postmodernism"--that have rendered it less
freakishly isolated. The fact remains that the <I>Wake</I> is largely
unassimilated, and while it is widely respected it is not a major element
in the ranking that Joyce consistently achieves in the end-of-millennium
polls. The day when our exegetical and theoretical efforts are equal to
its demands will not dawn soon. If such a consummation ever were to be
achieved, our cultural map, as I have argued elsewhere, would have to
have been completely redrawn.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to note, finally, that what I am saying in no way
implies that the reading or teaching of <I>Ulysses</I> should abate: new
readers, in or out of school, are much more likely to experience a text  akin to the one that was read in 1922 or 1961, in spite of the fact
that many of Joyce's technical innovations have now found their way into
the aesthetic practices of popular culture. It does imply, however, that
the best teachers are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force
of <I>Ulysses</I> even while they do their necessary work of explaining
and demystifying. And this, surely, will still be true in 2999.

One reason for the relative absence of negative criticism of Joyce may
be the sheer difficulty of his work, which has made exegesis a dominant,

bored critic looks for an adjective to describe the book, it is usually
"dull": thus Edmund Wilson, for all his admiration, comments: "There
must be something wrong with a design which involves so much that
is dull--and I doubt whether anyone will defend parts of <I>Ulysses</I> against the charge of extreme dullness" (Deming, vol. 1, 228; from
<I>The New Republic,</I> 1922). Harold Nicolson, in 1931, states: "At
moments Joyce becomes almost overpoweringly difficult to read and, as
such, almost overpoweringly dull" (Deming, vol. 2, 562; from <I>The
Listener,</I> 1931).

Jung, "<I>Ulysses</I>: A Monologue," 120. Jameson, in an odd echo of
Jung, finds the boredom induced by "Eumaeus" and "Ithaca" not a failure
on Joyce's part, but a success: "It is as though Joyce meant here to
force us to work through in detail everything that is intolerable about
this opposition"--that is, the opposition, hardened under capitalism,
between the subject and the object ("<I>Ulysses</I> in History," 139).

Austin Briggs provides a corrective to the prevalent idea that West
was unremittingly hostile to Joyce; see "Rebecca West vs. James Joyce,
Samuel Beckett, and William Carlos Williams," <I>Joyce in the Hibernian
Metropolis: Essays</I>, ed. David Norris (Columbus: Ohio State University
Press, 1996), 83-102. He also quotes her statement, appropriate
for this chapter, that we have a "duty of listening to our geniuses in
a disrespectful manner" .

After this bad start, it doesn't seem likely that Joyce will emerge with
much credit; but in fact by the end of the essay West has tipped the
scales a long way in the other direction, and <I>Ulysses</I> is serving
as one of her examples of what she calls "the necessity of art."

One exception is Luk&aacute;cs, whose objections in 1957 arose from
what he saw as technique for its own sake in the interior monologue of
<I>Ulysses</I>, by contrast with Thomas Mann's use of a similar method
in <I>Lotte in Weimar</I>, where its purpose is to allow the author "to
explore aspects of Goethe's world which would not have been otherwise
available" ("The Ideology of Modernism," 18).

Samuel Goldberg is more outspokenly critical in his volume on Joyce in the
"Writers and Critics" series, <I>James Joyce</I> (London &amp; Edinburgh:
Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1962): "He was still dogged by the self-image of
the 'fabulous artificer,' the technical virtuoso. And the result lies
visible in the more superficial, mechanical, merely cerebral aspects
of <I>Ulysses</I>, in the obvious, laborious 'brilliance' that he
over-valued--and that led many critics into over-valuing as well" .

Raymond Williams, who writes of <I>Ulysses'</I> "greatness" in <I>The
English Novel</I>, is probably reacting similarly when he relates his
reservations about <I>Finnegans Wake</I> to "the strains already evident
in the later sections of <I>Ulysses</I> (before the last monologue)"

In "Is There a Case Against <I>Ulysses</I>?," in <I>Joyce in Context</I>,
ed. Vincent Cheng and Timothy Martin (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1992), 19-39, Denis Donoghue defends the book against two
critics, Bersani and Jameson. He conflates their two very different
responses (Jameson, as we have seen, offers a positive assessment in his
only extended discussion of <I>Ulysses</I>), and reads them as if they
were echoes of early Stalinist objections to the book's preoccupation
with its characters' subjective experiences. If this were the case being
made against <I>Ulysses</I> by either Bersani or Jameson, there would be
simpler rejoinders than Donoghue's trawl through Saussure, Deleuze and
Guattari, Levinas, Derrida, Barthes, Benveniste, and Marcuse to find an
account of language that does not assume a punctual origin in the subject.

Interestingly, Moretti makes the opposite argument: that the author
of <I>Ulysses</I> "considers the aesthetic sphere incapable of being
either an example to, or a compensation for, the state of the world"
("The Long Goodbye," 208).

Morris Beja pointed this out in his introduction to a panel on
"Hostile Responses to Joyce" at the 1992 Dublin Symposium--one of the
rare instances of counter-voices being given a space within the Joyce
establishment, even if Joyce tended to emerge triumphant once again (see
"Approaching Joyce with an Attitude," in Morris Beja and David Norris,
eds. <I>Joyce in the Hibernian Metropolis</I>, 71-75).

In <I>The Renewal of Literature</I> Poirier argues, like Bersani, against
a notion that the reading of literature can be a source of cultural
renovation; but he adopts a very different attitude to the technical feats
of modernist writers, including Joyce. Of the latter he writes, "No one
more brazenly celebrates his own sheer capacity for what James called
'doing'" ; but this is in the context of a claim that the reading of
such works is "an activity by which with great difficulty we can become
conscious that any structure, technique, code, or system of signs is
likely to prove no more than extemporized and transient" . Poirier
is surely correct to insist that "it is not the substance but rather the
act of allusiveness or of schematization which should occupy the reader"
, but it may be that the act of reading <I>Ulysses,</I> at least as
an advanced student or professional scholar, is no longer the vigorous,
demanding, chancy business that Poirier celebrates.

Eliot was a notable exception, but there is every indication that he
was responding to the <I>idea</I> of <I>Ulysses</I> (or his idea of
<I>Ulysses</I>), and not to the text, and that few others shared his
sense of the book's culturally wholesome character.

It's evident, I trust, that I am not finding fault with these and other
guides and reference books; my concern is only with their unintended
effects. Most of them represent meticulous labors that have been of
inestimable help to me and to a myriad other readers. And perhaps one
should note that it only takes a group of astute readers, armed with
all the reference books, to tackle a few paragraphs of <I>Ulysses</I>
to discover how much remains speculative and challenging.

Although most of the work being done on Joyce's notebooks and other draft
material is continuous with the grand exegetical project that dominated
Joyce criticism in the twentieth century, some of it has had the very
different aim of defamiliarizing the published text and raising fresh
questions about what it means to "read Joyce"--notably the ITEM group
in Paris.

In "Two Words for Joyce," Derrida describes the discomfort of inhabiting
Joyce's memory, "which is henceforth greater than all your finite memory
can, in a single instant or a single vocable, gather up of cultures,
languages, mythologies, religions, philosophies, sciences, history of
mind and of literatures," <I>Post-structuralist Joyce: Essays from the
French</I>, ed. Derek Attridge and Daniel Ferrer (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1984), 147. He continues: "I don't know if you can
like that, without resentment and jealousy."
