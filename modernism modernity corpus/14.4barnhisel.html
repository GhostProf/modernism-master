<p>By the 1950s, modernism was quickly losing its status as a term denoting a rebellious or even revolutionary grouping of artists. Modernism's little magazines could no longer claim to be the harbingers of the new and unfamiliar, blowing up (<i>Blast</i>) or sweeping out (<i>Broom</i>) the old and irrelevant. In the form of abstract expressionism, it dominated painting; modernist, Bauhaus-influenced design was becoming ubiquitous in consumer products; bebop jazz was at its apex. If Philip Johnson's 1949 Glass House "made Modernism palatable to the country's social elites," 1951's Lever House marked the beginning of the International Style's ubiquity in institutional and commercial architecture.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Modernist hallmarks such as speed, simplicity, and streamlining even filtered into urban planning, as the legacy of Robert Moses still indicates. "Although [in the 1950s] one could always find quotable jabs at Modernism along the extremist fringes of public opinion," Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes in her biography of Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr, "the great moderate mass among educated Americans had by this time fully embraced the notion of abstract—or virtually any other kind of—art."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> </p>

<p>Modernism as a style or collection of styles had so much become the establishment, in fact, that it was even used to <i>defend</i> 

<b></b>

 the very societies and political systems toward which much modernist art had been, and still was, so relentlessly hostile. In the early 1950s the so-called "free world" in which modernism had gained such ascendancy was powerfully and disturbingly confronted by a social, cultural, political, and military force that insisted it was more modern than the moderns, the advance guard of the avant-garde, the end toward which history was unfolding. The Soviet Union, its satellite states, the revolutionary movements in the developing world, and Marxist ideology in general were, their leaders and adherents insisted, the concrete manifestations of the progress of history, and the "free world" would inevitably fall to their irrefutable logic. In response, the United States and the nations of Western Europe marshaled unprecedented military, economic, and even cultural resources to counter this threatening, competing vision of modernity and the future.  </p>

<p>Modernism itself became a weapon in what has become known as the "Cultural Cold War." In the early 1950s, the most important battlegrounds of <i>this</i> war were the sympathies of influential leftist Western European intellectuals, the vast majority of whom scorned what they saw as the U.S.'s shallow, business-dominated culture and its "Coca-Colonization" of the rest of the world but who were also leery of Stalinist authoritarianism and militarism. To these Europeans, American culture was Mickey Mouse and cowboy movies at best and malevolent military-imperialist power at worst. In response, the United States—primarily through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the cultural officers of the State Department—undertook an effort to "increase cultural understanding" between Europe and itself, an effort centered on the construction of an image of the U.S. with an intellectual and cultural life equal to, and in dialogue with, Europe's, an image which the U.S. then aggressively marketed to those skeptical European leftists. Nongovernmental agencies, too, joined the Cultural Cold War, sometimes with official support and funding and sometimes completely independently. The best known of the unofficial groups (largely because of the spectacular revelations of its covert CIA sponsorship) is certainly the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), which brought together American and European noncommunist leftists in symposia, conferences, and several journals, most notably <i>Encounter</i>.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But as many scholars have shown, there were dozens of other nongovernmental projects dedicated to "increasing cultural understanding" between the U.S. and Europe through such programs as academic exchanges, the distribution of books and films and artworks abroad, and tours by American musicians.  </p>

<p>In many of these projects, it was American <i>modernism </i>in art, literature, music, architecture, and even dance that served as evidence of American cultural advancement—but this was a modernism redefined and made safe for official sponsorship. In the following pages I look at a small, short-lived project that played a key role in redefining modernism as being characterized primarily by style, not by subject matter; in directing modernism away from its often collectivist/Utopian origins and toward bourgeois individualism; in transforming modernism from an avant-garde, oppositional movement to a style that could be comfortably embraced by diverse spheres of elite culture in the U.S.; and in constructing a coalition of elites that accepted and endorsed modernism as America's 

<b></b>

 high culture and that linked, however implicitly, modernism to the mission of the U.S. national-security establishment. And although this project—Intercultural Publications, Incorporated (IP), and its journal <i>Perspectives USA,</i> headed by James Laughlin of New Directions Books and funded by the Ford Foundation—had little quantifiable strategic effect in the Cultural Cold War, it is significant, I believe, in the domestication of literary and artistic modernism. <i>Perspectives</i> depoliticized and aestheticized modernism, contextualizing it as the natural product of free artists exercising free inquiry and free expression in a free society. In the pages of <i>Perspectives</i>, modernism was transformed from an oppositional literary and artistic <i>movement</i> forged by the desire to <i>épater le bourgeois</i> into an artistic and literary <i>style</i> that could be adopted by the power elite of the West—governments, universities, foundations, businesses—and then reflected back at the Europeans who had initially given birth to it. But this was a modernism deracinated from its avant-garde or revolutionary heritage, comfortable with capitalism and establishment power, making a compromise between cutting critique of the bourgeois order and mass (or "middlebrow") culture and its ultimate choice "of the West," as Dwight Macdonald memorably put it. Modernism itself became propaganda for a "Free World" defined by democratic institutions, free-market capitalism, and bourgeois individualism.  </p>

<p>The project was not without contradictions. In its self-presentation, <i>Perspectives USA</i> vigilantly policed what Andreas Huyssen has called the "great divide" between highbrow modernism and mass taste, but this was in the service of a larger argument for the superiority of American egalitarianism and meritocracy.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Like modernism itself, <i>Perspectives</i> maintained its high-modernist withdrawal from the capitalist economy even though it was created and directed by res from the business community and presented an argument for liberal capitalism. Finally, Laughlin's journal implicated modernism—a movement defined in its own pages as the creation of rebel individuals who rejected the commercialized mass taste of dominant society—in a collaboration between intellectuals, universities, foundations, the business world, the publishing industry, and the national-security state. </p>

<p>Underpinning Laughlin's project was his belief in a liberal, individualistic society and his desire to see that society confront and defeat what had become known as "totalitarianism." In this, of course, Laughlin was squarely in the mainstream of American political opinion. The most influential model for what a "liberal society" opposed to totalitarianism might look like was provided by Arthur M. Schlesinger's <i>The Vital Center</i> , which argued forcefully for the "liberal" ideology, identified by Schlesinger as the strain of American political thought that valued free expression, art, and unfettered education, and opposed the domination of the "business class." <i>The Vital Center</i> argues that the Soviet system in particular, and totalitarianism in general, seeks to undermine the individual, thinking, acting subject. "Direct political control," Schlesinger wrote in reference to the Soviet—and Popular Front—desire to determine the content of procommunist writing, "either throttles the serious artist or makes him slick and false."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Art suffers under the phony, predetermined standards of totalitarian expression: "Where direct political control cannot reach, the Communists and their 

<b></b>

 friends have exerted their influence toward lowering and softening artistic standards in a pseudo-democratic direction" (<i>VC</i>, 125–26). Schlesinger particularly stresses how modernist art—"the paintings of Picasso, the music of Stravinsky"—because of their ambiguity and strangeness, can only be appreciated by free individuals. Such works "reflect and incite anxieties which are incompatible with the monolithic character of 'the Soviet person'" (<i>VC</i>, 79). Artists, and writers in particular, are at the center of Schlesinger's exaltation of "radical nerve": </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Silone, with his profound moral sensibility; Gide, with his quivering sense of freedom; Koestler, with his probing, insatiable intellectual curiosity; Hemingway, who disliked people who pushed other people around; Reinhold Niebuhr, with his tragic sense of the predicament of man; George Orwell, with his vigorous good sense, his hatred of cant; Edmund Wilson, with his belief in moral and aesthetic taste.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">Providing an illustration of Schlesinger's characterizations of the crippled intellectual and artistic life under "totalitarianism" was the influential anthology <i>The God That Failed: A Confession</i> , a work compiling "confessions" from six former Communist Party members in Europe and the U.S.. The authors—Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, Richard Wright, André Gide, Louis Fischer, and Stephen Spender—contributed personal narratives of their immersion in, and eventual rejection of, the Communist Parties of their respective nations. Spender (who later became an editor of <i>Encounter)</i> bitterly regretted the way that the communists had taken control of the Popular Front anti-fascist movement of the 1930s. In terms that would later appear in <i>Encounter</i>, Spender attacked communist epistemology, in which "experience could only be drawn on in order to illustrate an aspect of a foregone conclusion, arrived at independently of the experience." Marxists even used this methodology in their literary criticism, praising Keats as a victim of capitalism, reading <i>Finnegans Wake</i> as an illustration of "the disintegration of thought and language of the bourgeois individualist world" and congratulating Virginia Woolf for recognizing the "historic necessity" of her suicide.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Independent judgment, even on aesthetic questions, is lost to foregone conclusions; each of the six writers describes the ominous fading of the individual himself under the glare of the Party's imperatives. </p>

<p>Lionel Trilling's collection <i>The Liberal Imagination</i>  also took up the question of the place of modernist or experimental art in a liberal society, but where Schlesinger was sanguine about how this art could coexist happily with liberal democracy, Trilling looked at the actual situation of the times and saw potential contradictions. Modernist art, he perceptively argued, was "indifferent" to "the liberal ideology," which Trilling identified as "a ready if mild suspiciousness of the profit motive, a belief in progress, science, social legislation, planning, and international cooperation."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Liberals—to Trilling the term encompassed most on the left in the 1920s through the 1940s—valued literature that had a social conscience, that examined social and political problems. "Our dominant literature," he complained, "is profitable in the degree that it is earnest, sincere, solemn. At its best it has the charm of a literature of piety. It has neither imagination nor mind." Modernists—"those writers who, by the general consent of the 

<b></b>

 most serious criticism, by consent too of the very class of educated people of which we speak, are to be thought of as the monumental res of our time"—avoided what Trilling saw as the simplistic, politically pliable practices of literary realism, and because of this, the political importance of the best works of the imagination of the time went unrecognized: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Proust, Joyce, Lawrence, Eliot, Yeats, Mann (in his creative work), Kafka, Rilke, Gide—all have their own love of justice and the good life, but in not one of them does it take the form of a love of the ideas and emotions which liberal democracy, as known by our educated class, has declared respectable. So that we can say that no connection exists between our liberal educated class and the best of the literary minds of our time. And this is to say that there is no connection between the political ideas of our time and the deep places of the imagination.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>LI</i>, 98–99)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The solution, as Trilling saw it, was the little magazine, specifically <i>Partisan Review</i>. <i>Partisan Review</i> in particular "has devoted itself . . . to organiz[ing] a new union between our political ideas and our imagination." Rather than aiming at mass appeal, the little magazines sought to affect an influential, elite few, and it would be a fallacy, Trilling insisted, to think that a magazine with a circulation of 6,000 cannot be "powerful" (<i>LI</i>, 103). </p>

<p>It will surprise no one familiar with the period that <i>Perspectives USA</i> became yet another forum in which the leftist New York Intellectuals and the largely conservative New Critics joined forces to argue for the vital importance of (often modernist) literature as a bastion of autonomous culture against both middlebrow kitsch and Stalinism, and for the need to evaluate art according to apolitical criteria such as formal complexity, ambiguity, psychological acuity, and rejection of mass taste.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  For these critics, modernism was also characterized by a particular attitude of an individual toward society: the modernist was an alienated rebel, heir to the romantic tradition of the solitary artist doomed to be misunderstood and rejected by a philistine society. From the work of 1940s and 1950s critics such as Spender, Rosenberg, Greenberg, Macdonald, Howe, and many others came the familiar image of the modernist artist as the individualist who creates great art even as society around him decays into the decadence of commercial culture, smug middlebrowism, or totalitarian "groupthink." For these critics, and for philosophers such as Theodor Adorno, modernist art was by definition opposed to mass culture, whether that mass culture was American, Soviet, or Nazi. These theories that dominated the 1940s through the 1960s were also gendered, emphasizing modernism's implacable rejection of (a frequently feminized) mass culture and the heroic individualism of the (almost inevitably male) rebel artist.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  From all of these ideas arises the understanding of high modernism that in large part still persists today, even if only as a straw man: outwardly and explicitly concerned with the process of its own creation, formally complex, erudite, resistant, psychologically sophisticated, apolitical, intellectual rather than emotional, masculine rather than feminine, and (as the <i>Little Review</i> put it) "making no compromise with the public taste."  </p>

<p>In the early 1950s, then, the "serious artist"—the modernist—was one who rejected mass taste, who avoided simplistic realist representation, who mistrusted political messages 

<b></b>

 in art, and whose art investigated the psychological complexities of the individual subject. At its extreme, modernism embraced aestheticism and <i>l'art pour l'art</i>; but even among those modernists and critics (such as the New York Intellectuals) who felt that art had some role to play in society, direct political content conveyed through realist representation was seen to limit the importance and accomplishment of the artwork. This apolitical, even oblique, modernism does not, clearly, seem like a promising propaganda weapon: but its very apoliticality made the "modernism" constructed by Greenberg, Rosenberg, <i>Partisan Review,</i> and the New Critics a key component in an argument about the cultural superiority of the West. </p>

Cold War Modernists

<p>Although Stalinism was increasingly discredited among European leftists by the 1950s (particularly after the Hungarian uprising of 1956), national Communist Parties, especially in Italy and France, remained strong, and many prominent leftist intellectuals and artists—such as Sartre, Picasso, and Léger—sympathized with or belonged to them.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  These intellectuals were attracted by communism's egalitarian and anticolonial stances, but many were also motivated by their opposition to American political, military, and economic power as it was increasingly exercised in Europe. Moreover, many leftist intellectuals also felt and expressed the strong <i>cultural</i> antagonism that precipitated the Cultural Cold War. </p>

<p>As Rob Kroes points out, hostility to American culture among European intellectuals intensified after the First World War, when "a generation of conservative European critics of culture . . . looked toward America with the ominous sense of watching Europe's future . . . . Theirs was an anguished awareness of the erosion of cultural standards ushered in by the age of mass consumption and mass culture."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  This "awareness" persisted into the 1950s, when, increasingly, it was the U.S.'s essential shallowness, caused by its lack of historical consciousness, that Europeans attacked: "Whether they see Americans as cold, efficient, conformist, or unstoppably energetic, they always refer to aspects of a national mentality that is seen as being on the surface, never probing the depths of its innermost stirrings, never rising above the immediate here and now."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In their most damning and persuasive arguments—arguments repeated by the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) after the Second World War—these intellectuals dismissed American culture as commercial, shallow, exploitive, and venal. In this view, modernism's great experiments could never occur in the United States because its culture valued only mass art, popular entertainments, and creative work whose quality was judged by success in the marketplace. American politicians grew concerned about this during the cold war, when even President Eisenhower, whose campaign had derided Adlai Stevenson as an "egghead," worried that Europeans saw Americans as "a race of materialists . . . . Our successes are described in terms of automobiles and not in terms of worthwhile cultural works of any kind. Spiritual and intellectual values are deemed to be almost nonexistent in our country."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The unofficial beginning of the Cultural Cold War is often seen as the crashing of a 1949 Cominform-sponsored conference in New York by "Americans for Intellectual Freedom," an ad hoc group of American intellectuals and artists, many of them former communists, led by Sidney Hook. Seeing an opportunity, the Office of Policy Coordination (an agency created by the National Security Council in 1948 to pursue psychological warfare against the Soviets, and later merged into the CIA) attempted to organize these members of what became known as the "noncommunist left," and after a few unsuccessful forays in 1950 brought these Americans together with those in Europe to create the CCF, an ostensibly independent group in fact funded by the CIA and with CIA operatives in high positions.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The CCF published an influential and popular magazine (<i>Encounter</i>), ran symposia, and sponsored tours of musicians and artworks primarily intended as propaganda for the West, but with a secondary goal of showing Europeans that American art and cultural life was as advanced and accomplished as that of anywhere else in the world. Although the U.S. Department of State undertook many overt programs of cultural diplomacy and propaganda, ranging from lending libraries at American consulates to the Voice of America to sending William Faulkner abroad as a goodwill ambassador, the CCF sought to achieve many of the same goals without alerting audiences to its governmental links.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>

<p>In these efforts, the CCF, USIA, and State Department often spotlighted how American artists and intellectuals were contributing to and even spearheading international modernism. However, not everyone accepts the claim that the CIA uncomplicatedly used modernism as a propaganda tool. Robert Burstow reviews what he calls the "revisionist" scholarship of Eva Cockroft and others, and suggests that history presents "a far more complex situation and a need to rethink existing presumptions about the CIA's aesthetic tastes" and the general attitude toward modernism.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And beyond the CIA, American public res were even less supportive of modern art. The McCarthy era saw many conservative public res (notably House Committee on Public Works chairman George Dondero) attacking modern art and the MoMA as "instrument[s] of Communist subversion," and MoMA director Barr had to deny in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> that "modern art" was "communistic."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  It wasn't just conservatives, either; President Truman remarked while looking at a "mildly distorted rative painting by Yasuo Kuniyoshi" that "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot," and in 1947 Secretary of State George Marshall forbade spending "taxpayers' money on modern art."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  However, even Jane de Hart Mathews grants that in the end the antimodernists were "outmaneuvered by more sophisticated individuals [such as Barr and MoMA benefactor Nelson Rockefeller] eager to capitalize on the fact that <i>avant-garde</i> art and culture exist only in a society that is liberal-democratic (politically) and bourgeois-capitalist (economically)."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  A depoliticized modernism, identified as "modernist" by virtue of formal and stylistic characteristics (including difficulty), presented as the work of heroic individualists working in a free society, and used as evidence "that American society was so free ideologically that no form was too experimental or abstruse for toleration and even support," was a key component of cold-war era rhetoric.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>In 1952, James Laughlin of New Directions Books was the long-time publisher of American modernists such as Pound and Williams and, since the war ended, he had been also publishing European and Latin American modernists in the U.S., work that won him the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor from the French government. Although Laughlin was largely apolitical throughout his life, he also felt that "totalitarianism" was a threat to the experimental writing and intellectual freedom that he valued so highly, and that modernist art and literature could only be produced in a free society. Moreover, he felt that modernist writers—"word-workers"—could bring about reform through transforming consciousness itself. Early in his career, he wrote that, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The world is in crisis, and language is at once the cause and the cure. New social concepts could stop the waste and the destruction. But they can only be introduced into minds ready to receive them, minds <i>able </i>to think along new lines, minds capable of imagination . . . . Experimental writing has a real social value, apart from anyother . . . . However my contributors may see themselves I see them as agents of social reform as well as artists. Their propaganda is implicit in their style and in probably every case (originally, at least) unconscious . . . . Their points of departure and immediate objectives are various, but all have a similar ultimate aim—the perfection of a clearer, richer, more meaningful verbal expression.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Laughlin also had come to feel, as a result of the Second World War, that the U.S. had a special responsibility to advance freedom—artistic and intellectual freedom—worldwide.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In 1946, Laughlin traveled in devastated Germany on behalf of the State Department and on this trip was struck by the desperation of the German people, and concerned by what he saw as their vulnerability to the specious promises of communism and to the "false idea . . . that America is a nation of 'materialists' and 'barbarians' incapable of spiritual and cultural activity on a high plane."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To counteract this, Laughlin decided to export culture. In his oral history of Intercultural Publications, Laughlin reminisced that his friend Robert Hutchins, a former president of the University of Chicago and at the time an associate director of the Ford Foundation, had approached him in 1951 about undertaking such a project. "I thought immediately," Laughlin said, "of intercultural exchange through books or through magazines, through the printed word." Because the recently ended war had caused an "almost total blackout of cultural exchange" between Europe and the U.S., </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I suggested to Hutchins and his associates that it might be worthwhile to attempt to put out a magazine of American culture which would be made available in translation in some of the principal languages of Europe and which would be sold, particularly to students and intellectuals, at a subsidized low price and that the successive issues of this magazine would attempt to bring together a panorama of what had been going on in American writing, in American philosophy, in architecture, in art, in music, in the whole cultural spectrum.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>With an initial $5,000 grant, Laughlin prepared a sample issue of <i>Perspectives USA</i>. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>It's difficult to imagine just how big the Ford Foundation became when, at the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the Ford family gave 90% of the stock of the privately held Ford Motor Company to the Foundation. Given the governmental assessment of each share's value of $135, the gift was worth $416,880,000, but the real worth on the open market was significantly more. When the Foundation sold 20% of that stock to the public in 1956, the sale brought in $643 million, suggesting that the Foundation had owned $3.2 billion worth of Ford stock. In his 1956 overview<i> The Ford Foundation: The Men and the Millions,</i> Dwight Macdonald notes that the Foundation's assets at that time were "considerably more than half as much money as all the other foundations in the country have among them."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  And Ford spent its money on a scale beyond what the other foundations could imagine: in 1954, it spent four times as much as Rockefeller (the second-largest American foundation at that time), and ten times the amount of Carnegie Corporation (the third-largest). Not only its wealth but its projects were massive: one initiative, for instance, was to increase higher-education faculty salaries in the U.S., and to accomplish this the Foundation divvied up $210 million and distributed a proportional share to every college and university in the nation. </p>

<p>The Foundation's mission, as set forth in its 1950 "Gaither Report," was (and remains) to "strengthen democratic values, reduce poverty and injustice, promote international cooperation, and advance human achievement."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Culture was an avenue by which these goals could be achieved. "The officers," the Foundation noted in the 1951 Annual Report, "regard the exchange of ideas, and possibly also of artistic and literary productions, as one of the most promising methods of fostering the development of World understanding and a sense of the moral and cultural community among the peoples of the world."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In this vision, its mission meshed with the liberal view of America's mission in the world. The Foundation was deeply involved, and invested, in the U.S. project of cultural diplomacy. Nowhere was this involvement more clearly seen than in Europe, where the Foundation, the State Department, and the CIA worked along parallel tracks or even intersected (as with their joint funding of the CCF). In the 1950s, Ford's mission to "strengthen democratic values" led it not only into numerous projects intended to counter Soviet influence in Europe and the developing world, but to hire as its officers men who had had practical experience in precisely those fields. Paul Hoffman, who became the President of the Foundation in 1950, came to that job from a previous position as administrator of the Marshall Plan and brought with him Milton Katz, who became a Foundation associate director; Shepard Stone, who joined the Foundation in 1952 and later ran its International Affairs program, had been director of public affairs in the office of the U.S. High Commission in occupied Germany. The Ford Foundation was eager to use culture as a weapon against Soviet totalitarianism, and its officers had practical experience in just such efforts. </p>

<p>The desire to distance high culture from commercialism motivated Laughlin and the Ford Foundation as well. Unlike New Directions, Intercultural under Laughlin's leadership had the luxury of abstaining almost entirely from participation in the capitalist economy.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Intercultural was funded by a foundation, was not expected to turn a profit or even to earn its investment back, and was distributed free of charge through U.S. embassies and consulates or at cultural events. (It was also sold in bookstores and at 

<b></b>

 newsstands.) Its editors worried more about <i>who</i> was reading it than about <i>how many</i> were buying it. In this, it further sheltered modernism—for there was no question that the project would be dominated by modernism—from its bogey, mass culture. The proposal for the creation of <i>Perspectives USA </i>specified that the purpose of the project was "to promote peace by increasing respect for America's non-materialistic achievements among intellectuals abroad." The Foundation echoed the concerns of American intellectuals and of President Eisenhower, adding that, "At present, America's cultural standard is judged by such popularized media as Hollywood movies, certain popular magazines in the mass field, etc., which arouse the derision and contempt of foreign intellectuals and students, creating an attitude which contributes to the concept of America as a commercial imperialist."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Interestingly, Laughlin blamed the "propagation" of this "false idea" that Americans are "materialists" to economics, and his solution was also economic: offering a product at a subsidized low price. </p>

<p>In the initial proposal for the magazine, Laughlin suggested that it be priced at twenty-five cents for foreign markets—enough to make it seem like an independent venture, for "if the magazine were 'given' away it might acquire the taint of propaganda."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  (In the U.S., the journal cost seventy-five cents.) Identifying the National Association of Manufacturers-style advertising that was increasingly giving pro-business forces a powerful vocabulary of words and images in American public life, but that would only play into Europeans' worst prejudices about America, Laughlin insisted that the journal should print "<i>No</i> propaganda for the 'American Way' etc."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Echoing Laughlin, IP Project Administrator Hayden Carruth (a poet and former editor of <i>Poetry</i>) wrote to Hutchins in September 1952—immediately before the first issue appeared—that,  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is . . . a danger inherent in any attempt to subsidize the acceptance overseas of American achievements. Enthusiasm may inspire a breach of taste; zeal may turn publishers to propagandists, artists to proselytizers. The directors of Intercultural feel that the monumental program, though at first it may seem the only way to achieve an effect, offers a distinct risk. Intercultural should proceed by choosing projects that are clearly definable; the areas of need and the limits of our resources should always coincide.

<p>The need to correct supposedly erroneous impressions about American culture—especially those notions centering on commercialism—did not stop at the boardroom, either. The official press release for the launch of the journal noted that, "<i>Perspectives USA</i> will present significant American writing and art, with attention as well to music, the theater, architecture, philosophy and creative scholarship. The magazine will contain no propaganda or advertising."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  A French Voice of America radio transmission from 1952 also explained that, </p>

<p class="continued"><i>Perspectives USA</i> was officially founded in February 1952, when the Ford Foundation allocated $500,000 to the newly created nonprofit corporation Intercultural Publications, Incorporated expressly to publish <i>Perspectives USA</i>.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In choosing a board of directors for IP, Laughlin, who had already yoked art together with the world of foundations and the objectives of American foreign policy, brought in the business community, precisely the element of American society so reviled by leftist intellectuals. Approved with the initial proposal was a Board of Directors consisting of bankers James F. Brownlee and Joseph Hambuechen; Charles Garside of Associated Hospital Services of New York; H. J. Heinz II, whom Laughlin knew from Pittsburgh; the publisher Alfred A. Knopf; Richard J. Weil, a vice-president at R.H. Macy &amp; Co.; and businessman William J. Casey, who had worked in the London office of the Office of Strategic Services.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  With the exception of Knopf, the Board had little credibility in the literary and intellectual world, so IP also convened "an Advisory Committee drawn from such fields as literature, philosophy, history, music, scholarship, the arts, and theater and architecture" with a heavy representation of New York Intellectuals, New Critics, and modernist writers.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p><i>Perspectives USA</i> was published initially in English, French, Italian, and German and distributed to European and American bookstores and newsstands for sale, and to U.S. embassies and consulates abroad for free dissemination. In advance of the first issue (which appeared in October 1952), an internal memo suggested printing 6,000 copies of the French edition, 5,000 of the British, and slightly lower numbers for the German and Italian versions, "with sights set on an eventual 15,000 or more" in each market.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> </p>

<p>The journal's editorship rotated issue by issue, among a select group drawn almost exclusively from the journal's advisory board. Laughlin edited the first number, followed by Lionel Trilling, Jacques Barzun, Malcolm Cowley, R. P. Blackmur, and others. The editor's job was less to solicit contributions than to make selections from already-printed work (few articles were commissioned specifically for <i>Perspectives</i>) and to provide an introduction that framed the issue's works within the mission of the journal. In the publisher's introduction to the first issue, Laughlin explained that, "this magazine will present literary texts from and about the United States and examples of American art and music. Its editors will try to set materials before their readers that may enable them to view the culture of the United States in accurate <i>perspective</i>."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The editor for the second issue—Lionel Trilling—granted the truth of <i>some</i> European prejudices, writing that, 

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I have . . . tried to represent only a special and particular part of [American literary] culture. I have drawn the prose from only a few periodicals, all of relatively small circulation although their ultimate influence is, I believe, rather considerable in the moral and intellectual life of the country. All of the writers are intellectuals in the possible special sense in which that word is used in America . . . . The name implies, as I understand its use, a certain intensity of commitment, the belief that the existence and the conduct of the intellectual class are momentous in and essential to the life of society, the acceptance of intellectual activity as a mandate, a status, a personal fate. The situation of intellectuals in America is an ambiguous one, for they are both admired and resisted for presuming to be what they are.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>From the first issue modernist art and literature dominated the magazine's contents. <i>Perspectives </i>1 includes work by William Carlos Williams, La Fontaine translations by Marianne Moore, a poem by Kenneth Rexroth, an overview of the work of painter Ben Shahn by Selden Rodman accompanied by color reproductions of Shahn's paintings, an appreciation of Aaron Copland by Arthur Berger, an essay on Van Gogh by art critic Meyer Schapiro, and reviews of books by Williams, Faulkner, and Mary McCarthy. The "selective listing of new books" focuses heavily on modernist art and literature (but also includes a complimentary note about Whittaker Chambers's anticommunist touchstone <i>Witness)</i>. Popular entertainments are either sneered at or absent, with the exception of an article on "Recent Trends in Motion Pictures and Television" by Gilbert Seldes (of <i>Seven Lively Arts</i> fame) in issue 4. Experiments in form are praised, while the excessively realist or explicitly political art that Trilling criticized in <i>The Liberal Imagination</i> is ignored or denigrated. But <i>Perspectives</i>'s is an institutional modernism, framed not as a revolutionary movement but as the latest phase in art's eternal inquiry into the human condition. The first piece in the first issue, Faulkner's Nobel Prize speech of 1950, adamantly insists that even in the present "tragic" era, in a time of "a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it . . . there are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up?" But, Faulkner says, the artist must transcend these immediate fears and return to "the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> </p>

<p>While <i>Perspectives </i>didn't have a house definition of the term "modernism," in its pages modernism was characterized by the style or form utilized by the artist, and by the artist's marginal position vis-à-vis dominant culture. In the introduction to the third issue, editor Jacques Barzun—who establishes his bona-fides as a modernist <i>avant le lettre</i> by pointing out that he had been "an early and close eyewitness of the modern movement in literature and fine arts"—calls "modernism . . . nothing distinct, but a miscellany . . . the new <i>forms </i>evolved between 1905 and 1915."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  [italics mine] Barzun stresses that although Americans may not be publicly embracing modernism yet, neither is Europe: "Its poets are <i>maudits</i>, which is to say, marginal and inaudible." <i>Perspectives</i>'s vision of modernism focuses less on the sense of history central to Pound, Joyce, and Eliot, and more on stylistic features such as abstraction, free verse, and the rejection of ornament. LeRoy Leatherman's article on Martha Graham, for instance, 

<b></b>

 compares her to "Picasso and Kandinsky" rather than "Joyce and Kafka" because she, like the painters, does not have to "work with the details of personality" as a realist must, but can rather focus her depictions on abstractions, "particular images which emerge out of a dominant image of man in his individuality, his wholeness."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  <i>Perspectives</i> also stresses, in its discussion of any genre, the way that modernist artists' true subject-matter is the <i>individual</i>: individual personality, the individual in conflict with society, the individual striving to create art, the individual's ethical responsibilities not to class or party but to human freedom. In its emphasis on individualism, <i>Perspectives</i> signals its rejection of utopianism, socialist realism, and Popular Frontism (all of which stressed art's responsibility to the group) and does much to reconcile modernism with bourgeois liberal ideology.  </p>

<p>In its evaluation of literature, <i>Perspectives</i> tended to denigrate works written to achieve sociopolitical aims and to scoff at criticism that reads literature sociopolitically. In a survey of "The Novel in America, 1920–1940," Arthur Mizener argues that "the real history of the American novel in this period" was that of Fitzgerald, Wolfe, Hemingway, Cozzens, and Faulkner, who "believed in the individual life and the final reality of the individual apprehension of experience, and very little in mass attitudes."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The second issue featured "Everybody's Protest Novel," James Baldwin's famous attack on the "very bad novel" <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, and by extension all works of art that seek primarily to achieve political, rather than aesthetic, aims. "It is, indeed, considered the sign of a frivolity so intense as to approach decadence to suggest that these books are both badly written and wildly improbable," Baldwin notes, alluding to the Popular Front/socialist-realist condemnation of modernism as "decadent." "Literature and sociology are not one and the same," Baldwin insists.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Ironically, the critical stance in these articles—in particular, their dismissal of realism—is much more congenial to the poetry reprinted in <i>Perspectives</i> than to the fiction, which consisted largely of reprints from the <i>New Yorker</i> by familiar authors such as E. B. White, William Maxwell, Jean Stafford, and John Cheever. </p>

<p>When providing an introduction to samplings of the work of a poet or painter, <i>Perspectives</i> frequently used an "overview" approach that subtly argued for those writers' and painters' enduring importance. It's not surprising, given his long-time friendship with Laughlin, that William Carlos Williams contributed to the journal, but the first issue is almost a tribute to Williams, with fifteen poems, a short story, and the essay "The Destruction of Tenochtitlán." While his contemporary work is essentially absent, here are many of Williams' best-known early poems: "The Red Wheelbarrow," "The Widow's Lament in Springtime," "This Is Just to Say," "The Great re," signaling that Williams had been welcomed into the literary establishment embodied not just by Laughlin but by Knopf, Allen Tate, Edmund Wilson, and other eminences associated with <i>Perspectives.</i> </p>

<p>In <i>Perspectives</i>, abstraction was evidence that the U.S., unlike the U.S.S.R., was a supportive environment for experimental artists. Throughout its run, <i>Perspectives</i> published a series of short overviews of American painters featuring almost exclusively those painters who had adopted abstraction and who worked in the modernist 

<b></b>

 tradition. These overviews tended to give biographical information and discussions of style and technique; attention to any kind of <i>political</i> or <i>social</i> intent for the works is essentially absent. In Issue 4, for instance, Jerome Mellquist contextualizes Marsden Hartley as one who "turned successively to postimpressionism, fauvism, cubism, symbolism, expressionism" but who turned "back to realism" in the 1930s. Was Hartley's the radical, working-class social realism that was characteristic of the 1930s? No: "He was back to Maine, Maine and a new realism" focused on Mt. Katahdin and the New England coast.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Writing about the painter Jacques Villon, Cleve Gray continues to define modernism as that which avoids commenting on the immediate, positing that Villon—after the German invasion of France, even—"began to paint an ideal world . . . [in] a language drained of the immediate and the sensational, an idiom in which he could speak of pure inwardness and serenity."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Arthur Dove, according to Robert Goldwater, "simplifies and eliminates until his whole design is unified by a single strong rhythm of free fluent forms and a few striking colors . . . there are no human res in Dove's pictures . . . his desire is to portray [nature's] immensity in symbolic terms."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) Even the magazine's covers—many by Alvin Lustig, the house designer at New Directions—were abstract designs, implicitly arguing for the supremacy of that kind of visual representation. </p>

<p>Ironically, <i>Perspectives</i>'s first article of this sort was on Ben Shahn, a painter associated with the American social realist school. Shahn is the kind of painter that a European leftist could love: "Creator of the most 'American' of images, he is more critical of his country's 'materialism,' political backwardness, and local prejudices than any Paris Existentialist on a six-months shopping tour of native blight."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  However, although Selden Rodman's article does not skirt over Shahn's political views, and a reproduction of Shahn's painting <i>Death of a Miner</i> accompanies the article, Rodman is careful not to portray Shahn as the kind of revolutionary who can't make peace with American society: Shahn also worked for "the Container Corporation, the Columbia Broadcasting Company, and such magazines as <i>Fortune</i> and <i>Harper's</i>." Striking at Shahn's endorsement by the Popular Front, Rodman argues that Shahn should really be seen as one who <i>balances</i> social conscience and mission with a devotion to form, process, and abstraction. </p>

<p><i>Perspectives</i>'s articles on architecture—both domestic and institutional—reject the collectivist architectural philosophies of Gropius and Le Corbusier for, again, a pragmatic individualism. Frank Lloyd Wright is praised as a "bitter enemy of the classical tradition" in that he believes that "all great architecture grows out of an individual response to an individual's needs."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In terms of domestic architecture, while European modernists designed multiunit dwellings such as Le Corbusier's "Tower in the Park," <i>Perspectives </i>focuses on modernist innovations in the single-family house, even the California ranch house. Hugh Morrison, in "American Houses: Modern Style," praises Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House as "less a house in the ordinary sense than a work of abstract structural art." In terms that echo the description of modernism throughout the run of this journal, Mies's concern is "the creation of pure forms of an uncompromising technical perfection and aesthetic integrity." Morrison concludes that "modernism has won a decisive victory over eclecticism."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>Although not specifically about artistic modernism, Jacques Barzun's article "America's Romance with Practicality" could serve as the philosophical core of <i>Perspectives</i>'s approach to modernism and culture, in that it links American pragmatism to modernity and the role of the (implicitly modernist) artist in a free society. Barzun responds to the European accusations that, "Pragmatism is the national creed glorifying the businessman and now that American business dominates half the globe, practicality is king" not by denying that pragmatism dominates the U.S., but by turning the accusation back on the Europeans: the very discovery of America, he points out, was motivated by "the search for comfort and power." Pragmatism, as it is practiced in America, is in fact the potential savior of a "polyglot planet"; it <i>is </i>modernity itself, he grants—and a good thing, too. Barzun concludes with a remarkable idea of the relation between the artist and his society: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The pioneer, trader, or businessman succeeded because there was plenty of room and plenty of substance to waste. Now we need a different order of mind, still wedded to practicality—still in love with it—but more conscious, more complex, more self-critical. He may be a businessman still, or an administrator of private or state concerns, but he must learn the new lesson of effectiveness by stripping every purpose bare and seeking the minimum means to attain it . . . . This lesson he can and must learn from the only type 

<b></b>

 of man who is and has ever been an incorruptible pragmatist—the artist. . . . I suggest the transformation of our commercial and technological habits of mind under the artist's impatient desire for fitness, for complexity, and for success in the thing aimed at . . . . If America's great romance is to continue and thus prolong Western civilization, it will be because the child of that romance, the artist, has begun in our midst and with our aid his endless task of raising images of good and teaching practicality.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Just as artistic modernism expresses the essential character of free individuals in the modern world, our businessmen and administrators should learn from, and emulate, artistic modernism in their own pursuits. And the "complexity" of modernism, far from being impenetrable, esoteric, and arcane, actually creates "images of a good and teaching practicality."  </p>

<p>Finally, <i>Perspectives</i> maintained the New Critics' and New York Intellectuals' stance that artists should be "critically distanced, but engaged," a stance perhaps best extolled in Allen Tate's "To Whom Is the Poet Responsible?", a speech from a 1951 CCF conference and reprinted in issue 6. In the essay, Tate responds with characteristic sarcasm and irony to the charges (first leveled by Archibald MacLeish in <i>The Irresponsibles</i>) that the modernist poet had ignored his  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>total responsibility for the moral, political, and social well-being; it was pretty clearly indicated that had he behaved differently at some indefinite point in the near or remote past the international political order itself would not have been in jeopardy, and we should not perhaps be at international loggerheads today. We should not have had the Second World War, perhaps not even the first.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The responsibility of the poet is to be a <i>poet</i>, Tate insists; and, perhaps, eventually, poets' insights on the nature of what it is to be human will inform political action: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The human condition must be faced and embodied in language before men in any age can envisage the possibility of action. To suggest that poets tell men in crisis what to do, to insist that <i>as poets</i> they acknowledge themselves legislators of the social order, is to ask them to shirk their specific responsibility, which is quite simply the reality of man's experience, not what his experience ought to be, in any age. <i>To whom</i> is the poet responsible? He is responsible to his <i>conscience</i>, in the French sense of the word: the joint action of knowledge and judgment.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As the editors expected, the journal was received enthusiastically in a few overseas circles, skeptically in others, and hostilely in one. The American, English, German, and Italian issues of the first number sold out in just a few weeks, while "the French edition did not do as well as the others—there is a strong wave of anti-American feeling in France at present—but the press reviews, in France as well as in the other countries, were predominantly favorable, except for attacks in the pro-Communist papers."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  A year later Laughlin wrote to Shepard Stone that "PROSPETTI [the Italian title of <i>Perspectives</i>] is a terrific success in Italy—beyond my best hopes. But . . . it is tough going in France. We may have to resort to 'planting' there. They apparently just hate an American looking package."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  (. <a href="#2">2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>) 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Quickly, and increasingly over the short life of the magazine, its sponsors at the Ford Foundation grew impatient with Laughlin's inflexible refusal to print <i>anything</i> he considered excessively political. This change in attitude coincided with a shakeup at the top levels of the Foundation. Over the 1952 Christmas holiday, Henry Ford II ousted Hoffman from his post as President, moving the Foundation offices from Pasadena to New York and isolating Hutchins and Milton Katz (another Foundation administrator who had been a supporter of IP) in California. Ford replaced Hoffman with Rowan Gaither, a San Francisco lawyer who had headed the study group that issued the eponymous 1950 report, and a new group of administrators. The Foundation was also receiving attacks from the right, now aimed at the Fund for the Republic, a civil-liberties group (headed by Hoffman and then by Hutchins) that had sprung up in the wake of Senator McCarthy's anticommunist crusade and to which the Foundation had given $15 million. </p>

<p>The tension at the Foundation quickly filtered down to Laughlin's little project, and Foundation administrators consistently tried to narrow Laughlin's understanding of "politics" and "propaganda." Even before Hoffman left, Milton Katz wrote to Laughlin in regard to the Books for India program, urging Laughlin not to shy away from distributing <i>any</i> work that could be read as endorsing Western systems of political or economic organization. Asking Laughlin if he would feel that John Stuart Mill's <i>On Liberty</i> or <i>The Federalist Papers</i> would be "propaganda," Katz demanded, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Would it not be a rather precious definition of "culture" which would exclude books of this kind? Work of this sort might well be inappropriate for PUSA, but the scope of Intercultural Publications, Inc. will presumably be broader than the sphere of PUSA.</p>
<p>I take it that all of us would quickly agree that Intercultural Publications, Inc. should not be used as a vehicle of propaganda or cultural warfare. But the border lines are not always clear. In the anxiety to avoid propaganda it is possible to slip unwittingly into a sort of propaganda in reverse . . . . For instance, there are people who would scoff at any attempt to prevent the circulation abroad of such books as <i>Babbitt</i> or <i>Middletown</i>, but who would hold up their hands in pious horror at the thought of circulating books like <i>Darkness at Noon</i> or Beck and Godin on <i>Russian Purges and the Extraction of Confessions</i>.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">After Hoffman and Hutchins left, the pressure became more direct. Shepard Stone, who had joined the Foundation in 1953 to head its European outreach programs, preferred projects such as the CCF that combined culture and politics more pointedly. In 1954, pressured by Stone to consider aping <i>Encounter</i> and print political writing, Laughlin responded that <i>Perspectives USA</i>'s place had "always been to keep out of the political t, to think of the field of culture as one where people of opposed ideologies can still meet on friendly ground and learn to respect each other as human beings." Culture, rather than politics, was "an ideal channel of communication because it so often seems to appeal to the best side of our natures. It is a natural symbol of our aspirations for a better life."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  In a remarkable display of obliviousness to what his own magazine was doing, Laughlin suggested that Ford pull back from its political stances and separate itself from the CCF because the dissemination of high culture by itself would inevitably make things better:

<p>Even the directors, at times, were unhappy with <i>Perspectives</i>'s orientation. William Casey, for one, was angered by Mary McCarthy's article "America the Beautiful," in which McCarthy, directly confronting European accusations about American culture, laments the "vulgarity" and impoverishment of American commercial culture. Incensed, Casey told Laughlin, "I agree that we cannot eliminate criticism [of American society]. But we have managed to concentrate on it and to ignore those aspects of American society in which we can have pride. We have exaggerated the liabilities and largely ignored the assets." In a tirade that in many ways epitomizes the 1950s conflict between the disengaged critical highbrows and the cultural middlebrows, Casey then turned his ire on Trilling, the issue's editor,  </p>

<p>who in his introduction, remarks that many Americans resent and resist intellectuals for being what they are. This is typical self-praise. I don't think that I resent or resist the people who call themselves intellectuals. But I do resist their frequent attempts to decide all things for all men on the grounds that they represent some superior casts (<i>sic</i>). My feeling, and that of many Americans, toward a certain type of left-wing intellectual is not based on resentment at their being intelligent or intellectual (Trilling wrongly implies that the two words are synonymous). It is based on my considered judgment that most of them are unintelligent, ignorant of many of the facts of life, and substitute slogans, cliches, and the juxtapositioning of half-baked ideas for the process of thought.</p>

<p class="continued">Casey then added that Trilling, McCarthy, and the other modernist intellectuals who dominated the journal were regrettably "ignorant of the great principles of liberty

 and the concomitant requirement of decentralized economic and political power, the theory and practice of which represents one of the great American contributions to world culture."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup> </p>

<p>Laughlin defended Trilling and McCarthy's article (which had originally appeared in <i>Commentary</i>) but promised Casey that the "fourth number stresses what I would call the conservative tendencies in contemporary American culture."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Casey also pushed for <i>Perspectives USA </i>to run an article by the management theoretician Peter Drucker—"a good change of pace for <i>Perspectives</i>"—but both Laughlin and Carruth resisted this, Carruth insisting that the article was "poorly written" but also  </p>

<p class="continued">Casey's objections here underscore the difficulty of using modernism to achieve these political ends. Casey eventually became, as Director of Central Intelligence, the very embodiment of the national-security state, but here his objections stem much more from his self-conception as a <i>businessman</i> and as a defender of "decentralized economic and political power." One can depoliticize modernism, Laughlin shows us, but it's much more difficult to de-"highbrow" it—to make it friendly to liberal capitalism. In fact, Laughlin's project was to <i>reinforce</i> modernism's association with the highbrows, and at the same time to expand the category of "highbrow" to include elites outside of the cultural world. </p>

<p>Additional pressure on Laughlin to alter his editorial stance came from the "Reece Commission," the Special Committee on Tax-Exempt Foundations of the United States House of Representatives, convened by Tennessee Representative Carroll Reece to investigate the activities of tax-exempt foundations in the United States.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  In hearings held in May and June 1954, the Committee came down hard on the Ford Foundation, especially, for supporting groups such as the Fund for the Republic and Intercultural Publications (which had printed work by former socialists and communists). No legislation came out of the Reece Commission, but it did help push public opinion against the Foundation, and especially against organizations such as Intercultural. When Laughlin wrote to the Foundation in the fall of 1954 requesting $2.5 million to keep IP running for another four years, the board responded with a terminal grant of $500,000, enough to publish <i>Perspectives</i> through issue 16 and keep Intercultural afloat until October 1956.  </p>

<p>Although Ford's changing priorities, brought about by new administrators, public pressure, and the Reece Commission's investigation, were primarily responsible for the end of the magazine, its own limited impact—the fact that it could not convincingly quantify or explain what it was accomplishing—contributed, as well. Many of the European intellectuals at whom these propaganda efforts were aimed, moreover, were 

<b></b>

 perfectly aware of what this publication was intended to accomplish, and ridiculed it because of its provenance. "The magazine provoked widespread resentment in Europe, not only because it was 'so obviously an American package,' but also because of its 'inauthentic' institutional origins," Hugh Wilford remarks, quoting a letter from Stephen Spender—who knew something about this, having been an editor of <i>Encounter—</i>to Allen Tate.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  An exhaustive "Study of 'Perspectives' in England, France, Germany and Italy" by Frederick Burkhardt of Bennington College, submitted to the Foundation in July 1954, concluded that the culture-exclusive orientation of <i>Perspectives</i> was "on the whole . . . good," but that the actual focus was too avant-garde and too literary, to the detriment of other forms of art such as music. Responses by targeted readers were equivocal—the Italian intellectual Carlo L. Ragghianti, for instance, wrote that "<i>Prospetti</i> has a very limited success and very little penetration . . . . I believe that this review has no value, or at least very little."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  The report, ordered by Stone, was on the whole complimentary when evaluating the magazine on its own terms, but for a reader looking for evidence that <i>Perspectives</i> was having a direct effect on European leftists' attitudes about American political aims it would have been disappointing. Knopf, writing to Laughlin after seeing this report, certainly expressed Laughlin's own feelings when he said that "I think it undignified and even to a degree insulting to have our work constantly—evaluated I think is the word you used—by outsiders."<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not everyone was disappointed by the journal. Many of Burkhardt's respondents praised <i>Perspectives</i>, and in March 1956, the Brussels office of the USIA reported happily that it was  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>one of the most effective instruments at the disposal of USIS/Brussels for informing Belgian intellectuals of developments in the arts is the Ford Foundation's "Perspectives" (French edition, "Profils") . . . . The response to "Perspectives" has been uniformly favorable, even in certain circles of "intellectuals of the left" who are normally very critical of the United States.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The Brussels Public Affairs officer writing this dispatch praised the journal's fiction, poetry, art criticism and reviews, noting that,  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Perspectives" has performed for the European intellectual a unique function in providing him with a panorama of contemporary American activity in the field of arts and of ideas, which is matched by no other single American periodical.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This "panorama," of course, was hardly exhaustive, or even accurate. Laughlin's portrait of American cultural life is dominated by apolitical modernist experimentalism. Charged with the responsibility of showcasing American cultural life "in accurate <i>perspective</i>," Laughlin packages an American culture dominated by just one strain and produced overwhelmingly by a small number of writers, artists, and critics. In this package created for European consumption, modernism is humanist, apolitical, and utterly dominant. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In July 1956, <i>Perspectives USA</i> published its sixteenth and final issue, noting to its readers that "we continue to believe that cultural exchange of this kind contributes substantially to better world understanding." Epitomizing both the founding vision and the fate of the journal was George Kennan's contribution, a reprint of a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art by the former State Department intellectual and architect of containment. In familiar terms, Kennan bemoaned European misconceptions of Americans as "vulgar, materialistic nouveaux riches, lacking in manners and in sensitivity, interested only in making money, contemptuous of every refinement of aesthetic feeling," and regretted that "the blind workings of our commercial interests" do nothing to correct those misconceptions.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Culture—"artistic creation and the higher forms of scholarly thought"—must be brought to bear on this problem, for through culture we can find common ground with our friends in Europe even if they do not share our immediate political interests ("IEA," 10). "What we have to do," Kennan concludes, "is to show the outside world both that we have a cultural life and that we care something about it." But Kennan turns his argument around, as well, insisting not just that we need to do a better job of disseminating our high culture to Europeans but that we must truly devote ourselves to openness and exchange with other societies for our <i>own </i>good<i>: </i></p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[H]owever great the importance of international cultural exchange from the standpoint of our relations with other countries, this is not the main reason why we Americans have need for cultural contacts with other peoples at this time. The main reason lies rather in our own need as Americans for just this sort of enrichment of our national spirit. I am persuaded that any really creative development in the field of art or literature is intimately connected with international contact and is, in fact, unthinkable without it.</p>

	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Kennan concludes that "there has grown up among us a most reprehensible habit, a totalitarian habit in fact, of judging the suitability of cultural contributions by whatever political coloration we conceive their creators to have acquired. I know of nothing sillier than this" ("IEA," 13). Facing the end of his pet project, partly because of just such a "totalitarian habit," this remark of Kennan's must have rung painfully true to Laughlin. </p>

<p>In his 1967 essay "The CIA and the Intellectuals"—one of the first articles to attack the CCF after the revelation of its CIA funding—Jason Epstein argued that the problem with the CIA's program was "not a matter of buying off and subverting individual writers and scholars"—this, in fact, would be a process quite in keeping with the capitalist model of organization that the CIA was pushing. Rather, Epstein points out that the CIA "set . . . up an arbitrary and factitious system of values by which academic personnel were advanced, magazine editors appointed, and scholars subsidized and published, not necessarily on their merits . . . . but because of their allegiances. The fault of the CIA was not that it corrupted the innocent but that it tried, in collusion with a group of insiders, to corner a free market."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup> </p>

<p>In their significantly smaller way, <i>Perspectives</i> and IP did much the same thing. As the publisher of Pound, Williams, H. D., and many other American modernist writers, 

<b></b>

 Laughlin had already done much to shape public understanding of literary modernism. In <i>Perspectives</i>, though, Laughlin's apolitical modernism extended to encompass all of the arts; a reader of <i>Perspectives</i> was presented with an image of contemporary artistic expression in the U.S. that was remarkably of a piece in terms of style and strategy. At the same time, the oppositional, even revolutionary, impulses that underpinned so much modernist art would be redefined as being aimed not against bourgeois society, capitalism, and liberal individualism but against middlebrowism, mass culture, and Stalinoid instrumentality. In other words, Laughlin sought to "corner [the] free market" of ideas about modernism in a way that made modernism useful to the coalition of business, foundations, universities, and the state in the service of their larger politico-cultural objective: creating a cross-cultural alliance of writers, artists, and intellectuals who would discard their disdain of the U.S. and join with the Americans in opposing the Soviet threat.  </p>

He was joined in this strategy by a small, short-lived, but intriguing group called the "National Committee for an Adequate Overseas U.S. Information Program," headed by public-relations godfather Edward L. Bernays. Laughlin attended the group's conference in December 1954 at which it proposed a more effective public-relations campaign than the one at the time being run by the USIA: the National Committee worried that the USIA's campaign was too emotional, too focused on appealing representations of American life rather than on clear explanations of American objectives, too top-down from Washington, and too transparently propagandistic. (In 1955 Bernays wrote to Laughlin asking if IP might work with the Committee, but nothing came of that proposition.) Edward L. Bernays to James Laughlin, 16 Aug. 1955.
