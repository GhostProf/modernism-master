<p>
In the Gregorian year 2000, Rosh Hashanah dinners were politically
intense in Jerusalem. An unwelcome visit to Muslim shrines by Ariel
Sharon (then leader of the Knesset opposition) was followed, only hours
before the festival began, by violence. At the time, I was finishing my
first year as a citizen of Israel and was taken aback to find a member
of Ehud Barak's government, a re of international prestige, at the
New Year's dinner I was attending. I naturally hoped the minister could
tell us things we had not heard on the news and that he could offer a
sense of what the government might have in mind to do. But the minister
had questions of his own. Is it not true, he asked, that those elected
to parliament in Scandinavian countries are required even today to
swear allegiance to the state and the state church? Why could not Arabs
elected to the Knesset be required to swear allegiance to Israel as a
specifically Jewish state? The minister feared development, not only of
an Arab fifth column in Muslim/Christian areas of Israel like the Galilee,
but also a pro-Palestinian bloc in the Knesset. I do not remember at this
distance how much history the minister was offered that evening, but I
did not say aloud what I was thinking. It was the oath of allegiance to
the Established Church that had kept elected Jews (Lionel de Rothschild,
notably) from sitting in the House of Commons for much of the Victorian
era, and here was a member of the Jewish state parliament wondering
aloud whether Jews should not demand a likewise impossible oath of Arab
Muslims and Arab Christians. So far as I know, the minister in the end
proposed no such oath to the cabinet. But the fact of his raising its
possibility&#8212;even under pressure of High Holy Day violence in the
Holy City&#8212;had me thinking about . . . T. S. Eliot.

<b></b>

<p>
Or rather, I was thinking about the ironies of history and naming them, as
a shorthand, T. S. Eliot. For here was a state founded by free-thinking
Jews for free-thinking Jews. Its founders had not conceived it as a
place even for religious Jews, though accommodations were made for
them; and certainly not as a place for non-Jews. A Jewish state was,
even the Soviets agreed, an obligation after Auschwitz. No gentile
state&#8212;given history&#8212;could trust itself to guarantee Jews
so much as a right to breathe. So like Aeneas and his band, returning
from a Troy in ruins to an Italy the goddess Venus said they came from,
Zionists and refugees with no obvious place to go arrived at a piece of
land they did not want to know was inhabited. "Now what?" has been the
question ever since.
<p>
Whether Israel is a real democracy is not the issue. (A columnist in
<i>Haaretz,</i> the most distinguished Israeli newspaper, wrote recently
of the prime minister: "Sharon, the man with the balls of steel, has the
leadership vision of a blind goat.") At issue is a problem more Eliotic:
At what point does diversity begin to attenuate identity? Can a Jewish
state, in other words, be both free-thinking (inclusive, pluralist,
liberal, secular) and meaningfully Jewish? The answer that Israeli
governments have consistently supplied or implied since 1948 has been
Eliotic as well. I would go so far as to suggest that Israel may be the
country that most fully embodies what Eliot hoped the modern world might
be and, moreover, the culture in which the word <i>modern</i> appears to
mean most nearly what he meant by it. Israel offers something like the
mix of homogeneity and "friction" (the population is more than eighty
percent Jewish, but the Jews split into mutually disdaining factions)
that Eliot argued will characterize any flourishing culture.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
The continual outcry from Sephardim, including politically powerful
Sephardim, against the undue influence of the Ashkenazi elite testifies
to Israel's having the kind of "graded society" that Eliot consistently
favored (and continued to advocate even after he endorsed democracy in
the wake of World War II).
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Eliot never argued for theocracy and Israel is not one, but the rabbinate
is a cultural and political force here (the Sephardi and Ashkenazi
chief rabbis are employed by the government; synagogues and yeshivas are
subsidized by secular taxpayers; large numbers of yeshiva students are
exempt from military service). The Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties,
which have ministers in every cabinet, ensure that aspects of Jewish
law are enforced (however haphazardly) by the state.
<p>
It is said that the large secular parties, left and right, are held
ransom by their needing Knesset votes from small religious parties to
form governments, but the details are more complex&#8212;and complex
in ways that Eliot might have appreciated. Beginning with the founders
of the state, secular Jews have been unable to find ways of asserting
the Jewish identity of Israel without reference to religious tradition,
and they have sometimes viewed the state in messianic terms. Even without
rabbinic pressure, the secular majority might insist that public education
include Jewish religious content, and it seems that nonreligious Jews
are as opposed to permitting Christian proselytization&#8212;it is
forbidden by law in Israel&#8212;as is the rabbinate itself. Secular
Jews are pleased, in my experience here, when their beliefs are seen
to coincide with Jewish religious tenets (Israeli vegetarian literature
presents as prescient the rabbinic

<b></b>

and biblical concern with animal welfare). I have seen nonreligious
Jews exhibit contempt at the ultra-Orthodox refusal to recite
hallelujah psalms on Israel Independence Day; and the irony goes,
ironically, unnoticed. Some of Eliot's best polemic concerned the piety
of atheists. He was touched by the Christian simplicity of Bertrand
Russell's belief in gentleness ("St. Augustine did not believe more")
and made likewise rude remarks about Joyce, Nietzsche, Baudelaire,
Voltaire, and other post- or anti-Christians.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
In Israel, an equivalent polemic would have no point. The relation
between the nouns <i>Jew</i> and <i>Israel</i> is more like the relation
between <i>Christian</i> and <i>Christendom</i> than like that between
<i>Christian</i> and <i>Europe.</i> The title of Eliot's essay "Why
Mr. Russell Is a Christian" was a clever provocation. An Israeli version
("Why Mr. Grossman Is a Jew") would be neither clever nor provocative;
it would be otiose or inane.
<p>
As for myself, let me add immediately, the mix of homogeneity and
friction in my new home is uncomfortable. I have learned in my almost five
years here that I am more American&#8212;more Californian&#8212;than I
suspected, that diversity (and divergence from norms, any norm) are for
me, simply, needs. The argument made by communitarians, against thinkers
like Habermas, that liberal culture is too "thin" to sustain worthwhile
communal life is an argument less easy to make if you have lived with
real cultural thickness. In practice, a "thick" culture is one composed
of neighbors&#8212;people who regard themselves as family, with a right
to disapprove (emphatically, if sweetly) the degree and sort of your
conformity to convention. I have yet to attend a wedding, funeral, or
circumcision in Jerusalem at which a well-meaning friend or colleague
has not questioned some aspect of my comportment or the clothes that I
have chosen to wear. The poet who could formulate the phrase "menace and
caress" (<i>The Dry Salvages</i> I: 31) would know with some exactitude
the feelings that are, on such occasions, stirred. I wonder, in fact,
how much Eliot, who is said to have worn green pancake makeup to London
dinner parties to achieve who-knows-what effect, would have suffered under
a Christian and communitarian order of the kind he claimed to desire. I
suspect he would have taken to reading Bakunin or Tzara and hung up the
bowler hat. I suspect, also, that the debate between communitarians and
pluralists has gotten nowhere in the United States because everyone on
both sides is ambivalent. As Eliot said, there is no culture that can
satisfy all human needs simultaneously.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
(I spend a lot of time on airplanes.)
<p>
Identity is not the only human need. But identification with established
groups seems, increasingly (and in my view, for the worse), to be among
our primary desires. There is no sense my rehearsing recent history in the
Balkans, Rwanda, Congo, the former Soviet republics, the Islamic world,
and almost everywhere else&#8212;identity is not only not dissipating
as a need, it is reasserting itself with a vengeance. Carl Schmitt,
on the far German right, held that "people can only be unified against
other people," and the reflex is to reply: then let them not be unified.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
The attempt to liberate Western thought from its tendency toward
either/or exclusiveness is a postmodern project I esteem. In its service,
I would not mind abandoning traits of communal identity (and thus unity),
even were the result what Eliot called "thin soup."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
(Consomm&eacute; has, after all, its uses.) The trouble is that the
process of self-dilution seems not to affect the

<b></b>

need for enmity&#8212;the enmity that underwrites identity&#8212;on the
part of others. The final dissolution of an adversary's identity may be
aggressively pursued.
<p>
An implication of <i>The Tradition of Return,</i> the first book I
wrote about modernism, was that an obsessional desire for return to less
diluted states of a culture can follow on its aggressive liberalization.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Some modernists, like Eliot, felt that an effort was required to
bring about such a return in the West; others, like the author of
<i>Ulysses,</i> felt the return had come to pass autonomically. In either
case, "the way forward" was thought to be "the way back"&#8212;and
<i>modern</i> meant, for this sort of modernist, a renascence of the
renaissance of antiquity.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
I warned, in concluding that book, that liberalization or dilution
may draw an equal and opposite reaction; Heidegger and Pound felt
that armed force was required to set matters back on track. Zionism,
like the paleomodernism with which it was contemporary, defined itself
as in much the modernist sense revivalist. Official Israel remains
obsessed with <i>nostos</i>&#8212;Hebrew place names are restored (or
made up), biblical sites are excavated and glorified (at the expense of
less ancient ruins: "Roman <i>tchotchkes,</i>" as a colleague refers
to them). I live in a neighborhood of Jerusalem called the Greek
Colony. From the window as I write I can see the Greek consulate,
an International Style-cum-Deco structure in a neck of town rich in
Bauhaus architecture. Some Bauhaus architects escaped the Nazis and
did remarkable work in Jerusalem and especially Tel Aviv. The local
classicism is Judeo-modernist and distinctly post-refugee. Wet laundry
hangs from gracefully off-center windows, or along elegantly curved
banisters; potted geraniums and ivy obstruct cubist stairways. And the
effect belies the image of modernist classicism as unlivable and cold,
unlovable, and hard. Postmodernist architecture has made scant headway
in Israel because the modernist buildings have been made (in the Yiddish
sense) <i>heimisch.</i> It is not for nothing that so many academics
averse to modernism are also averse to Israel. My own sense is that
Israel is disliked more as a modernist state by postmoderns than as a
Jewish state by anti-Semites.
<p>
The modernist desire for return to a prior, less diluted state of culture
involved displacements and, as Eliot came to acknowledge, injustices.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Injustice to middles&#8212;to what comes between distant pasts and
revolutionary returns&#8212;is endemic to the process. Eliot confessed
in postwar essays to having written, earlier in his career, unjust
accounts of the Romantics, Milton, even Shakespeare: he explained
that he had thought their canonization, alongside Homer, Vergil,
Dante, would produce a taste for consomm&eacute;. Behind the culinary
metaphor was a philosophical argument about which I have written at
length elsewhere, an argument that&#8212;if applied to culture and,
moreso, politics&#8212;can motivate an exclusionary urge.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
The philosophy is radical, but its social consequence reactionary:
"since reality is conventional, and truth determined by conventions of
language&#8212;it was necessary to maintain a rigorous and exclusive
vocabulary in order to have truth or reality at all." The problem with
adding terms from one vocabulary&#8212;one rival vocabulary&#8212;to
another is that doing so "threatens the continuity and even the existence
of reality."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Pluralists now act as if this argument had never been raised or
as if it has by this time been transcended, though versions of it
continue to be made and applied by pragmatists like Stanley Fish,
some Wittgensteinians, and

<b></b>

most Kuhnians. Our pretending that the problem is behind us, or has no
implications for war and peace, has left Sharon, Arafat, and Bush to
answer philosophical questions that have defeated, not only Eliot, but,
in my view, Wittgenstein, Kuhn, and pragmatism as well.
<p>
There is urgent, incomplete work to pursue, and intellectuals defer
responsibility by quarreling with each other, ad hominem and to no
result. The urgent question Eliot failed to answer ("unity and diversity,"
he named it) may be over our heads as well, but perhaps not if we begin
by confessing bewilderment. Intellectuals outside the academy are better
at honesty than we are intramurally (they are not paid, as academics are,
to hold ground and till fields). Solzhenitsyn, for example, by reputation
an anti-Semite, has published a study of Russian-Jewish relations in which
he takes the stance: I want a genuine conversation, a reconciliation,
with Jews before I die. The response outside Russia had been minimal to
Solzhenitsyn's first volume, so I arranged to have two chapters translated
into English and published in <i>Common Knowledge</i>&#8212;the journal
I set up to stare enmity (not enemies) down.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
I find Solzhenitsyn's critique of Russian Jewry (my maternal family is
from Russia) stimulating. But I am not optimistic that the international
dialogue Solzhenitsyn wants, given the glory to be won in battle with
him, will not become an opportunity for recrimination. Still, here and
there, mostly within walking distance of where I now live, there are
groups of Christians and Jews, Muslims and Jews, Muslims, Christians,
and Jews, who pursue honest discussions they hope may lead, eventually,
to edifying conclusions. The relationships among the monotheisms and
their proponents are intricate and troubled, have been radioactive
for centuries, and demand a sustained attention that neither secular
nor religious thinkers have shown them until recently. The Vatican
Curia came, it appears, to this conclusion first. The Catholic Church,
since the death of Pius XII, has abandoned supersessionism, affirmed the
Jewish covenant as irrevocable, and sought a serious exchange with Jews
(and more lately, Muslims) at the level where incommensurability seems
to lurk: theology. But Rome has met with no equivalent response.
<p>
As for the academic community, I am aware of numerous, quietly productive
connections maintained between Western (Christian, Jewish, secular)
and Muslim scholars. But the boldest recent development, and improbably
the most promising, is the appearance of Edward Said's <i>Freud and
the Non-European.</i>
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
There, a myth contrived by a Jew (the most famous free thinker in
the era of <i>After Strange Gods</i>) is deployed in the service of
fusing horizons&#8212;Jewish with Arab horizons. Said's book imagines
a shared Middle Eastern milieu that dates back before either Judaism
per se or Islam. <i>Moses and Monotheism</i> is perhaps not the best
place to begin the dialogue, that process of fusion; though the choice
of Freud, a kind of Zionist, a trustee of the Hebrew University,
as chief fuser makes an agreeable irony. It is Said's method that
inspires hope. His looking to modern hermeneutic principles to resolve
a dilemma that others would solve by imposing pluralism, forcefully,
on the whole Middle East is a step in the direction of health. Rival
milieus&#8212;coherent vocabularies closed (to quote Eliot quoting
Bradley) on the outside&#8212;can be immiscible or even incommensurable:
their continuity or even contiguity requires the establishment of a
credibly shared history.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<b></b>

Hence Said's appreciation of Freud's myth of Moses the Egyptian learning
monotheism at the pharaonic court. But hence, also, the story's inutility
(it has at best the status of midrash). As George Steiner says, Freud's
was a myth aimed to remove a "lightning-rod" from the Jews before the
Nazis could strike them for burdening mankind with monotheism.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Said could have achieved the desired result, however, with recourse
to no text but the Hebrew Bible. He could have explored in detail
passages in the Torah where non-Israelite precedents of Israelite
religion are acknowledged explicitly (Gen. 14:18-20, Exod. 18:9-27,
Num. 22:8-24:25). The least dubious, the most believable, route to
a shared milieu would be the obvious one: Islam and Christianity each
developed, historically, with reference to Judaism; and the rabbinate, as
I suggested recently in <i>Common Knowledge,</i> could come to recognize
them both as "Israelite monotheisms."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
The Christian church has from early days referred to itself as
Israel. Instead of blaming the church for appropriating that birthright,
Jews could acknowledge and take pride that traditions of intelligence
and splendor, Christianity and Islam, have adapted Hebrew Scripture and
spread versions of its morality throughout the world. But an ecumenical
theology so inclusively grand entails a rhetoric for which there is no
respectable audience. Though ours is said to be a time of globalization
economically, it is intellectually (and on the whole, culturally)
the heyday of "local knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
It would be too much to claim, therefore, that Ishmael has embraced the
faith of Isaac, and Esau the faith of Jacob. It would be utopian to say
(as I would frankly like to say) that the peoples now resident in the
Holy Land are all Israelites, in some unthinkably wide sense, and belong
together here. But this much I believe we can say, and reading Eliot
can help us to say it: What we have on this stage of history is a family
reunion&#8212;thus far a tragedy. Aunt Agatha has not made an appearance,
and no one else knows how the Furies are transformed into Kindly Ones.
<p>
<i>The Family Reunion</i> failed, Eliot conceded, because he had tried,
in writing it, to reconcile ("adjust" was his verb) too much heterogeneous
material: "I cannot make it cohere," Pound likewise confessed, meaning
not just his <i>Cantos</i> but the world.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Oddly, Eliot's failure stemmed from his rejection of a foundational
Christian principle, and he rejected it on explicitly Pharisaic
grounds. Within a year of his reception into the Anglican Church, he
dared write: "The spirit killeth, but the letter giveth life"&#8212;an
inversion of St. Paul's inversion of Judaism.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Despite the implied philo-Semitism, Eliot's remark (directed against
those who saw liberalism as the spirit of Christianity) was a step toward
his conclusion about free-thinking Jews. Paul's subordination of letter
to spirit made the Judaic components of Christianity&#8212;Judaism shorn
of most law and custom&#8212;assimilable by gentiles. The preference
for specific detail over spirit, significance, or abstracted value
is proverbially Jewish (anti-Semites call it "particularism"), but
when that preference is taken up by gentiles, it is exclusionist with
respect to Jews. (Solzhenitsyn's critique of Russian Jewry hinges on
the attendant ironies.)
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Today, however, Jews constitute a majority in their own nation-state,
and the Arab minority in Israel neither wants assimilation nor is
being offered a full chance. The situation here is by no means unusual
internationally (and has taken more violent forms in southern

<b></b>

Europe and central Africa). Even if the Palestinian right of return (to
Israel proper) is abjured, a million of Israel's citizens will still be
Arabs. Peace will depend, here as in most places, on the reconciliation
rather than the separation of hostile groups.
<p>
A means of reconciliation ("conflict resolution" is no substitute)
is not now in serious development. A means that could be
developed&#8212;it is still on the books&#8212;is the one associated
with St. Paul. Multicultural fusions and ecosystems become thinkable when
the spirit of culturally specific beliefs and practices is extracted and
credited, then matched up with the gist of other cultures. Universalism,
Pauline or otherwise, runs against the grain of recent thinking,
which takes it as naive and thus laughable, or as imperialist and thus
oppressive. But critics of the argument for local knowledge have a point
in faulting contextualists for lending aid and comfort to Balkanization.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Both contextualism and universalism have had ill effects in
practice. Pluralism, which seems to combine these two approaches to
diversity, succeeds only in some places or only for so long. A Fourth
Way, however, may be inchoate. Theoretical work on the ambivalence
that persists within closed contexts, and historical work that shows
how permeable the closure of such contexts is and always was, have
brought us closer to solving the problems Eliot raised; though still
not close enough. The defense of pluralism against its adversaries,
against the dead by polemical means and the living by force of arms, is a
distraction. The job that most needs doing now is commensuration&#8212;of
alien contexts, discourses, cultures.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
And that job will be accomplished solely, if at all, by the process
(to quote Eliot one last time) of "quiet co-operative labour."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

of everyone else in some respects, and an opponent in several others,
and no one conflict, envy or fear will dominate. . . . The universality
of irritation is the best assurance of peace" (132-3). On conditions for
a culture's flourishing: "It is a recurrent theme of this essay, that a

George Steiner, <i>In Bluebeard's Castle: Some Notes Towards the
Re-definition of Culture</i> (London: Faber and Faber, 1971): "In
polytheism, says Nietzsche, lay the freedom of the human spirit, its
creative multiplicity. The doctrine of a single Deity, whom men cannot
play off against other gods and thus win open spaces for their own aims,
is 'the most monstrous of all human errors'. . . . In his late work,
<i>Moses and Monotheism,</i> Freud ascribed the commission of this 'error'
to an Egyptian prince and seer of the scattered house of Ikhnaton. Many
have wondered why [Freud] should have sought to shift from his own
people that supreme weight of glory. . . . He was trying to wrench the
