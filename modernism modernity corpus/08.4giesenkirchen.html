Ezra Pound's "parleyings with Browning" are most apparent in the
conception of the earliest Cantos.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Pound left little other direct commentary on the ways in which Browning's
 work influenced his own literary endeavors, although he frequently
 acknowledged Browning to be among the greatest poetic geniuses since
 Dante, one of the few that modern England had brought forth.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It has often been noted that Pound's early poetry imitates Browning's
 masks and the convolutions, colloquial tone, and rich, rugged rhythm of
 Browning's style. In his poem "Mesmerism" from 1906 Pound pays parodic
 tribute: "Here's to you, Old Hippety-Hop o' the accents."
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The tone of <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, where Pound stages his exasperating
 effort of comprehending Browning's <I>Sordello</I>, is still dominated
 by such a self- ironizing admixture of irreverence and admiration.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet, <I>Three Cantos</I> also gives more complex testimony, both of
 Pound's deep indebtedness to Browning and of his struggle for poetic
 originality. Designed to be the exordium of Pound's modern epic, <I>Three
 Cantos 1</I> in its first lines evokes Browning's <I>Sordello</I>as
 a precursor text that is the unique example for a new form: a "bag
 of tricks" for poetic renewal, "a rag-bag" for modern consciousness,
 a theater for disembodied speech.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Hang it all, there can be but one <I>Sordello</I>!

<BR>
Your <I>Sordello</I>, and that the modern world
<BR>

<BR>
Say I dump my silvery catch, shiny and silvery

<B></B>
<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Quarreling with his muse, throughout <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound points
out Browning's "quirks and tweeks," the jarring idiosyncrasies of his
poetry. A few lines offer a parody &agrave; la "Mesmerism": "Tower by
tower / Red-brown the rounded bases, and the plan / Follows the builder's
whim.  Beaucaire's slim gray / Leaps from the stubby base of Altaforte"
(<I>P</I>, 229).
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Others comment directly on <I>Sordello'</I>s confoundingly convoluted,
  allusive language and risky rhyming of the seemingly incompatible: "What
  a hodge podge you have made there!--/ <I>Zanze</I> and <I>swanzig</I>,
  of all opprobrious rhymes!" (<I>P</I>, 232).
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet it is precisely this daring strategy of assembling the disparate
 that Pound finds intriguing. He suggests that Browning created a text
 that borders on the grotesque: half epic, half burlesque romance--"The
 rough men swarm out / In robes that are half Roman, half like the
 Knave of Hearts"(<I>P</I>, 229).He particularly dwells on Browning's
 montage of historical res, facts, events, and settings. He knowingly
 appraises Browning's "bag of tricks," devices for putting historical
 and literary tradition to free poetic use, as he points out that
 Browning falsely implied Sordello to be Dante's sole forerunner that
 he borrowed from Arnaut Daniel (whom Pound in turn had portrayed as a
 forerunner of Dante's in <I>The Spirit of Romance</I>) "that trick /
 Of the unfinished address," and that Browning disregards chronology:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Alluding to the rags of <I>Sordello'</I>s narrator's motley dress,
Pound labels a "rag-bag" Browning's technique of employing background
materials, his drawing together bits and pieces into a plethora of
textual and historical details. Pound implies that Browning has given
him a good excuse for similarly pouring out on the public shore whatever
he has gathered from the ocean of his readerly consciousness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Pound was not to retain this image in later versions of <I>The
Cantos</I>, it is a metaphor for the technique he sets out to develop:
the collecting of luminous concretenesses from the poet's store of
knowledge for the rag-and-bone-shop of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first decade of <I>The Cantos</I>'s composition and revision has
offered critics a natural place to look for the formative ideas behind
the work as a whole<I>.</I>
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Various critics have dwelt on the fact that the drastic reduction of
 allusions to <I>Sordello</I> coincides with

<B></B>

an elliptical compression of Pound's language that helped introduce a
new era in modernist writing. One common conclusion has been that Pound
exorcised Browning from his <I>Cantos</I> in order to replace his own
Browningesque "quirks and tweeks" with an original, modern poetic form.
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 More recent criticism, most notably Mary Ellen Gibson's, has tended
 to acknowledge that neither in his letters and critical prose, where
 he returned to him again and again as a point of reference, nor in his
 poetry did Pound ever completely turn away from Browning.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Pound's reading of <I>Sordello</I>in <I>Three Cantos</I> indeed
 reveals how Pound explicitly worked his way toward <I>remaking</I>
 Browning, rather than <I>exorcising</I> him. Pound regards
 <I>Sordello</I>simultaneously as a particular text and as an
 "art-form." Only with great difficulty, Pound seems to say, can this
 form be abstracted from <I>Sordello</I> and applied to Pound's own
 composition. Pound writes to his father in 1915 that <I>Sordello</I>
 is a "great work and worth the trouble of hacking it out" (quoted in
 <I>GEPC</I>, 75). In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, he exhorts himself that in
 order to remake <I>Sordello</I>, rather than to incise it or scratch
 away at its surface, he needs to penetrate it, to chisel out its core:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Ronald Bush has pointed out, Pound apparently was one of the first
readers fully to understand that <I>Sordello'</I>s initial narrator is
the poet as a motley fool in a marketplace, who, having propped up his
show-booth and summoned up a community of dead poets as his audience,
keeps himself "out of view," hidden inside the booth in which he sets
out to "make speak . . . the very man [Sordello] as he was wont to do"
(<I>S</I>, 1, 15- 16). The poetic self has disappeared inside its
stage, the unfolding discourse itself. In <I>Three Cantos</I>, Pound
directs our view to this process and fathoms its implications for his
own art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ur-Cantos explicitly discuss Pound's preoccupation with finding a
poetic self, which was evident also in his previous experimentation with
Browningesque dramatic masks. In 1969, Hugh Witemeyer drew attention to
Pound's investigation of <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, a concept he derived from
Renaissance poets through Walter Pater: of how he could create a unified,
idiosyncratic, and yet disembodied, transsubjective, poetic force.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Pound's idea of <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, Witemeyer has convincingly argued,
 in essence underlay all of his subsequent aesthetic terminology, from
 "vortex" and "image" to "ideogram" and "paideuma." Yet Witemeyer did
 not acknowledge Browning's significance for this continuity within
 Pound's aesthetic. "Pound did not leap full-grown from the brow of
 Browning," Witemeyer asserted, claiming that, in order to come of age
 as a poet, Pound first had to move beyond <I>Sordello</I> toward Joyce,
 and beyond Browning's personae (which, he argued, never serve "as a
 means of self-construction" but "relive all the possible attitudes of
 the human spirit") toward a modernist construction of poetic selfhood.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 What is missing from Witemeyer's account is what Christine Froula has

<B></B>

since supplied: an acknowledgement that <I>Sordello</I>is a transitional,
proto-modernist text.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As the following shall show, Pound saw what he understood by
 <I>virt&ugrave;</I> already contemplated in Browning. The effort to
 create an idiosyncratic poetic self whose expressive power transcends
 subjectivity toward a stronger recreation of cultural reality is already
 at the heart both of <I>Sordello'</I>s narrative and technique.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Witemeyer's assessment that Browning's personae never serve "as a means
of self-construction" does not entirely agree with Pound's reading of
<I>Sordello</I>in <I>Three Cantos 1.</I> There, Pound quotes from a
brief address prefacing the revised 1863 edition of <I>Sordello</I>,
in which Browning chose to highlight that <I>Sordello</I> was "the story
of the development of a soul."

Pound recognizes that Browning's poem gives both epic and dramatic
dimensions to a half-historical, half-fictional narrative in the
form of a Dantesque transcendental journey--a journey, as Pound also
understands, that recasts the author's own making and history of
meta-poetic meditations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Pound ponders here are the complications in Browning's mediation of
poetic self. He wonders at the ways in which Browning's poem <I>is</I>
a means of self-construction while it simultaneously strives to live up
to the poetic ideal Browning had developed in his "Essay on Shelley":
the ideal of a poetic objectivity that would synthesize the poet's
subjectivity with transpersonal truth.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many critics have pointed out that Browning's "story of a development
of a soul" throughout at least the first three books of the poem closely
resembles his own endeavor to overcome Shelley's Promethean subjectivism.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The last third of Book 1 introduces young Sordello at Goito, an idyllic
 castle in the country near Mantua, secluded from

<B></B>

the town by a "slough" and "pine tree forests" (<I>S</I>, 1, 374). There,
under the tutelage of the Ghibelline countess Adelaide, Sordello enjoys
a sheltered upbringing reminiscent of Browning's own, which he passed
in the household of his parents and among the books of his father's
library. Sordello is surrounded by playful architecture, art objects,
and a pastoral garden landscape charged with the inviting mystique that
a childlike imagination projects.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Recalling his own poetic beginnings under the influence of Romanticism,
 Browning casts himself in the form of a young Sordello "less like a
 Troubadour than one of Shelley's protagonists," open to the influx of
 divine inspiration (<I>GEPC</I>, 83).

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Up and down

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to the "legend" of Romanticism the true genius, like Shelley's
Prometheus, defies the gods with his own transcendental aspirations
(<I>S</I>, 1, 516). This early life is for the first time overshadowed
by crisis when the question arises how the poet can really be "equal to
being all" without taking charge in the present affairs of his people
(cf. <I>S</I>, 1, 535-47, as quoted below).Affairs in Northern
Italy around 1224--the turmoil of Guelf and Ghibelline partisanship,
particularly the Ghibelline general Taurello Salinguerra's climactic
capture of the Guelf Count Boniface in the long-besieged Ferrara, and
the effects of civil warfare on the spirit of the divided population
in Verona--have been dramatized throughout most of the preceding
portions of Book 1. Now the narrator instructs himself: "Go back to the
beginning, rather; blend / It gently with Sordello's life" (<I>S</I>,
1, 597-8). In his "drowsy Paradise," Sordello grows a poetic soul
increasingly inclined, as Browning was himself, to observe the warts
of nature, the monstrosity of particulars, giving "to familiar things a
face grotesque; / Only, preserving through the mad burlesque / A grave
regard" (<I>S</I>, 1, 267; <I>S</I>, 1, 655-57). While he is thus
developing the first traces of his own <I>virt&ugrave;</I>, Sordello's
true initiation begins only as his yearnings for an audience urge him
to penetrate the forests that surround him in his seclusion, to go to
Mantua to become a Troubadour. There, Sordello defeats his forerunner,
the celebrated Troubadour Eglamor, in a spontaneous contest, a victory
that leads to Eglamor's death and wins Sordello Palma's favor--his
palm/Palma, reminiscent of the Petrarchan laurel/Laura--and appointment
as her Trouvere. Confronted with an audience, Sordello gives up demanding
that "'each shall love in me the love that leads / His soul to power's
perfection'" (<I>S</I>, 2, 439-40). His goal becomes to achieve a
more objective poetry that would, in the very expression of poetic self,
render a realistic and thus morally responsible picture of the all of
human experience. He takes on the task of reaching out to the actual
world of living men: of authentically portraying the struggles of the
individual existence through his crafting of dramatic personae and speech
(cf. <I>S</I>, 2, 568-87).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, as Pound notes, in <I>Sordello</I>this struggle for a new aesthetic
is not only mediated by the story of strife and repeated disappointments,
or the "marrow" of the meta-poetic discourse; it is also enacted in
narrative, dramatic, and poetic technique. If the presentation of Sordello
includes from the start that of Browning's own aesthetic becoming, it
likewise includes a plurality of articulations, a multitude of beings,
a community of voices, because the voice of the poem's evanescent motley
narrator, who is also a stand-in for the poet, is open to all kinds
of intrusions.

Here we find yet another version of the poet's self speaking, the
"meditative" voice, in Pound's phrase, in which contemplations on the
literary history of ideas mingle with scenes of Sordello's upbringing,
and then moreover the "murmur" of a chorus of speakers is quoted, perhaps
the ghosts of the Romantics. Their speech is then objected to by what
seems to be still another guise of the narrative voice, the race of men
addressing Sordello:

The motley speaker is the presiding narrator of the poem not so much
as the caricature that we actually see at the beginning of the poem,
but as the idea of the poet-self that overarches the poem's dramatic
technique. He embodies the poet not only clothed in the garment of
the poem's time, but altogether made up of patchwork, a theatrical
multitude. Like Browning in <I>Sordello</I> and his dramatic monologues,
the motley speaker speaks through the ghosts of the past he summons,
precursor poets and historical res, and is spoken through by them. His
voice is a stage for the presence of the

<B></B>

past--"Ghosts move about me / Patched with histories," comments his
reader Pound. <I>Sordello</I>, which Pound called "one of the finest
masks ever presented," finally sets an example for Pound.
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In it, the poet is poetic subject and object alike, and self is visibly
 transformed into a composite artifact, the text itself: "To paint, more
 real than any dead Sordello, / The half or third of your intensest life /
 And call that third <I>Sordello</I>" (<I>P</I>, 229-30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mary Ellis Gibson gives us what may be the definitive reading of
Pound's negotiation of Browningesque selfhood when, in her 1995 study
<I>Epic Reinvented: Ezra Pound and the Victorians</I>, sheargues that,
in the model of the poet as ragpicker that Pound adopts from Browning,
poetic self-creation and the epic quest for a renewal of the poetic
canon are one.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In any event, the question of how the poet realizes his
 <I>virt&ugrave;</I> and thus makes tradition new--how the individual
 poet res among and in turn affects the guise of those ghosts
 of literary history he summons--is not only the central question in
 <I>Three Cantos</I>but already a topos in <I>Sordello</I>itself. In
 the early stages of his poetic making at Goito, Sordello's talent is
 still overshadowed by his awe for the mighty Troubadour Eglamor at
 the Mantuan court, as well as Sordello's overall indebtedness to the
 literary past: "nor bid / Me rag by rag expose how patchwork hid /
 The youth--what thefts of every clime and day / Contributed to purfle
 the array / He climbed with" (<I>S</I>, 1, 897-901). Browning's
 poetic self emerging in the mask of Sordello here explicitly resembles
 the speaker's motley dress. Sordello's patchwork in this instance is
 still a sign of poverty of mature wit, a fault against which Pound
 warns his fellow poets in his early criticism, probably with his own
 endeavors to overcome his "Browningese" in mind: in "A Retrospect,"
 a collection of earlier pieces of criticism published in <I>Pavannes
 and Divisions</I> in 1918, he writes, "Don't allow 'influence' to mean
 merely that you mop up the particular decorative vocabulary of some
 one or two poets whom you happen to admire."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Browning's poem suggests a much more complex, transhistorical model of
 literary influence that anticipates Pound's. The elder troubadour Eglamor
 is to Sordello what Shelley is to Browning, and eventually Browning to
 Pound. Dante and Shelley are to Browning's <I>Sordello</I>what Sordello
 is to the <I>Purgatory</I> and eventually Browning to <I>The Cantos</I>,
 a ghost conjured up fleetingly, but whose work offers itself throughout
 for use and revision to the present poet.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound looks for a suitable persona to integrate
such complex relationships:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's left for me to do?
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have done pre-Dante?

Whom set to dazzle the serious future ages?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound answers to himself: "Not Arnaut, not De Born, not Uc St. Circ"
(<I>P</I>, 232), thereby echoing what Bush describes as <I>Sordello's</I>
narrator's "coming to terms with images of

<B></B>

his older failed poetic self" and at the same time reiterating his own
efforts in <I>Personae</I>, where Pound had cast off "complete masks of
the self in each poem" (<I>GEPC</I>, 83). <I>Three Cantos 2</I> still
comments directly on <I>Sordello'</I>s theme of successive poetic selves
and eras: "Another crown, thrown to another dancer, brings you to modern
times?" (<I>P</I>, 240). Yet already in Browning there is no clear linear
succession; Eglamor's, Sordello's, and Dante's achievements simultaneously
crowd the concluding reflections of <I>Sordello</I><I>.</I> The dynamic
of Browning's "semi-epic" literary quest integrates the circularity and
polyphonic contemporaneity of sacred history in a framework of perpetual
dramatic conflict. As he announces in <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, Pound
will have to consider the "trick" of Browning's "showman's booth." He
prepares to take his efforts out into some forum and establish his own
kind of polyphony.
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
<I>Three Cantos</I>'s ultimate background, materials that Pound introduces
in <I>Three Cantos 3</I> and will eventually rework in Canto 1 to replace
<I>Three Cantos 1</I><I>,</I> is Andreas Divus's Latin translation of
Book 11 of <I>The Odyssey</I>. There, Odysseus conjures up the spirits of
the past from Hades and makes them speak through the ghost of Tiresias by
feeding him blood. Browning gives a dramatized version of the same epic
topos at the beginning of his poem, thus prering one of the central
motifs of <I>The Cantos</I><I>.</I> Just as Browning's motley alter ego
summons a community of poets from the past, indicating that the poem draws
heavily on literary traditions and in turn is directed toward an audience
of co-creators, so the blind seer Tiresias offers for interpretation a
panhistorical glimpse to Odysseus, the future creator of civic order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The relationships among poet, epic, and world are negotiated in a
striking section at the symmetrical axis of <I>Sordello</I>to which
Pound paid particular attention. Browning-in-the-process-of-composition
takes over the narrative voice and more or less retains it for the almost
five hundred lines, concluding Book 3. Browning separates himself from
his poem as if it were a living world, yet one animated only while he
dreams it: "They sleep, and I awake / . . . being at Venice" (<I>S</I>, 3,
614-15). As if still in transition between such dreaming and waking,
Browning's voice meditates on the relations between those two realities,
the poet's and his work's. Commenting on his own poetic aspirations as
much as Sordello's, Browning portrays the creative process as an epic
sea voyage, and concludes that, as the work travels on alone in history,
only the audience can redeem the poet's transcendental force that his
work contains:  "no other may . . . be informed what fate / Intends,
if triumph or decline await / The tempter of the everlasting steppe"
(<I>S</I>, 3, 673-75).

The poet interprets his present reality in the light of his work in
progress. He seeks a "queen" just as Sordello had "demand[ed] a Palma"
earlier:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Palma (based on the historical Sordello's Cunizza and an analogue
to Dante's Beatrice), is an allegory of poetic glory, or "peace in
strife." She guides Sordello's poetic ascent toward the secret of
experience: moral awareness of an "out-soul," that is, Being as it
suffuses the yet alien "out-world" (<I>S</I>, 3, 319; <I>S</I>, 1,
757). Love for her transmutes both self and other in a poetic fulfillment
of Being and Knowledge: "the Use of Life, / An Alien turning Native to
the soul / Or body." Inspired by Palma, briefly before Browning's voice
intervenes, Sordello resolves to be "Gate-vein of this heart's blood
of Lombardy" (what Dante sees in Sordello in the <I>Purgatory</I>),
an embodiment of both poetic and political fraternity, an "aggregate /
Of souls and bodies" (<I>S</I>, 3, 556-60). He is now intent on
battling the "ignominious exile of mankind," even at the risk of his
own ignominious exile for his convictions (<I>S</I>, 3, 580).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As he overlooks a Venetian piazza, Browning's search for an equivalent
incarnation of ideal femininity ironically settles on a pauper--"You
sad disheveled ghost / That pluck at me and point"--a girl who touches
him as she is begging for alms (<I>S</I>, 3, 664- 65). Like his
protagonist, Browning is compelled to open himself to the out-world of
"the common sort, the crowd," as he recognizes in the girl's countenance
the faces of the unfortunate multitude. Yet there is no revelatory
transformation, not even such a doomed one as Sordello's. In the poet's
immediate present the problems that the poem-in-progress presents are
only intensified; the relationships among poetic vision, poetic work,
and socio-political reality are even further complicated. Instead of
unmasking the spectacle of Sordello's life, Browning's voice at last
implies that an artificial dramatic hodge-podge offers a more reliable
reality than any immediate present:

Characteristically, as Book 3 concludes, the present voice of the poet
becomes submerged again more and more among the voices of Sordello's
realm, and finally completely among evocations of Greek mythology and
the New Testament. According to Browning, meaning and moral instruction
can no longer be drawn from visionary contemplation, but only from the
maze of assembled poetic history.

In <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, where Pound wonders whether it is "worth the
[author's] evasion" not to show himself in his poetry, fifty lines
are heavily laden with references to the sequence concluding Book 3 of
<I>Sordello</I>, where it appears that Browning does show himself. Pound
writes: "I walk Verona (I am here in England)"--as Browning probably
already was again was when he wrote his description of Venice--"I can
see Can Grande (Can see whom you will)":

Pound may have taken the image of the poppy from <I>Sordello</I>
(<I>S</I>, 1, 705-16), where it presents itself to the romantic
mind as a natural symbol of imaginative exuberance. If, on Corpus
Domini (cf. <I>S</I>, 1, 766), the world offers itself as a spectacle,
ritualistically spilling its theatrical vitality, Pound has missed the
right moment to watch, and what remains for him is the poppy spoil,
scattered testimony of such an expression of life. He yet lacks a
focus, he flippantly complains, probably to Browning: "(Can see whom
you will)." Pound then attempts to recreate such a contemplative moment
like Browning's, in which Pound's immediate surroundings would merge
with the world and work of a literary precursor. He tries Catullus,
"the civilized poet who still understood the psychological reality of
myths," and Arnaut Daniel (<I>GEPC</I>, 115). After a number of ostensibly
forced invocations, Pound distances himself from his effort, which he
apparently thinks falls short of authenticity. He sets out to recollect
"a younger self" (<I>GEPC</I>, 115)--the Pound of 1908 during <I>his</I>
first travels in Italy--and naturalistically elaborates on Browning's
own subversion of the romantic crafting of revelatory moments:

Pound intensifies Browning's moment of isolation here; the narrator is
sitting like a beggar on the curb, not on a step reminiscent of past
splendors. Pound's remembrance of visits past, moreover, is blurred by
distractions, such as thoughts of food ("I had my rolls for breakfast")
and sex ("she was young, too young"). He thus extends on Browning's
own parodic vision of the "race" as his "mistress," which alludes to the
Beatrice of the <I>Vita Nuova</I>, the half-eroticized, half-spiritualized
little girl whom a young Dante watched walking in the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Browning's "ruined palace step," the locus of his emergence from his
poem, is also carried further, even takes on a new life, in Pound's
composition. This monument of past regal ascents which Browning
conspicuously rhymes with "the everlasting steppe" of poetic aspiration
is a metaphor for marred hopes of earthly transcendence (see <I>S</I>,
3, 675-76). In Pound this image is first explicitly replaced
with the horizontal "Dogana's curb," but then finds its way back into
the text a few lines later in the form of the steps leading up into a
Japanese temple, and thus into a whole new realm of motifs suggesting
the interpenetration of spiritual, natural, and artistic realities.

In the opening of the eventual Canto 3, finally, Pound recalls sitting on
the "Dogana's step," as if ready to climb the flights of the merchants'
city's history, those beginnings of modern economic government that will
be thematized in much of <I>The Cantos</I>, and of which the Dogana is
a monument.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Canto 3 already contains elements of Pound's later attacks on what he
 summarily called "usura": he sits on the step because "gondolas cost too
 much that year," and in the following lines evokes contrasting images
 of palatial splendors, individual impoverishment, and institutionalized
 greed (<I>C</I>, 11). Pound's gradual translation of Browning's image
 thus illustrates thematic continuities between <I>Sordello</I>and
 <I>The Cantos</I>. They are both concerned with poetic power's losing
 battle with political power and the socio-economic deprivation politics
 effects. Browning's contemplations on the social, political, and moral
 role of the poet at the end of Book 3 look forward to the events of Book
 4 (leading, as echoes from Dante suggest, to the innermost circles of
 hell), where Sordello faces devastated Ferrara, its vexed population,
 and the Machiavellian Taurello Salinguerra. As it had in Book 2, the
 vicious circle of leaving isolation only to find himself more isolated
 closes once more for Sordello when he emerges from his meeting with
 Salinguerra, already crushed in spirit, only to find that the ravished
 populace celebrating him is barely able to tell him from Eglamor,
 and asks for nothing but light entertainment.
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It appears that there

<B></B>

cannot be poetic truth in what does not touch the lives of the
downtrodden, at the same time that the lives of the downtrodden are
generally closed to poetic truth. Throughout <I>The Cantos</I>, Pound
shares and develops Browning's respective visions of Dante's Paradise
as a utopia of poetic power and deepest Hell as a climate inescapably
hostile to such power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As it retraces the events of Book 4, <I>Sordello</I>'s Book 5
climactically dramatizes Sordello's battle with the politics of his
time. Now it is for most part Sordello who speaks directly, with his
awareness having gradually grown to a dimension comparable to the
author's. His reflections on his own past and the ephemeral nature of
his aspirations torture and rupture his intent with hesitations. His
very concern for self-expression, his Apollonian strife, he finds,
is feeble compared to Salinguerra's Bacchanalian power politics. In a
splendid moment, his monologue before Salinguerra in Palma's presence,
he climactically abdicates direct political responsibility and formulates
a matured, vitalist poetic whose first premise is the endeavor to overcome
the original limitations of self.

Browning describes his own poetics here. The salvational force is located
in literary tradition, the "deeds" of poetic thought, the survival and
progressive evolution of consciousness in art. Leaving it to posterity
"to unveil the last of mysteries," Sordello promises that he will
dramatize all of human experience he could possibly embrace, and that
he will disengage himself from his own creation, so that:

That Sordello should be the author of Browning's poem follows the logic
of the poetic just expressed--"Themselves before, the multitude turn you"
(<I>S</I>, 5, 536). As Sordello gives voice to the philosophy that guides
the writing of <I>Sordello</I>, he has taken the role of the creator--yet
this philosophy simultaneously leads to the abdication of any integrated
authorial presence. Thus, this climactic moment foreshadows the end
of the poem. Sordello's insights include the expectation--as it turns
out, an attitude of mind larger than he himself can bear--that his
own efforts are limited, that even his undone, transmuted self awaits
further undoing before it can be constructive. In the middle of his thus
"decompos[ing]" himself, Palma surprises him with the news, conferred
upon her at Adelaide's deathbed, that he in fact is Taurello's son. As
his rightful heir, Sordello is presented with the badge of Ghibelline
leadership, which, after Ecelin's retirement to a cloister, none of his
descendants seems fit to wear. The situation leaves Sordello in complete
disarray. Book 6 depicts the warfare of his multitudinous, conflicting
attitudes of mind, which finally turn in on his vital powers. He is
found dead with the badge at his feet, leaving leadership to Alberic
the tyrant, and thus Italy to further devastation. Sordello's forerunner
Eglamor's ghost haunts the conclusion of <I>Sordello</I> as a vision both
of the protagonist's own failure, the failure to live up to himself, to
match his thought in deed, and of the religious hope that there might be
spiritual progress after all, "spiral on spiral, gyres of life and light"
(<I>S</I>, 6, 804). Yet, the poem suggests, such progress certainly is
not linear and not easily measured in terms of individual human history;
"Sordello's chance was gone" for posterity (<I>S</I>, 6, 835).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Pound writes in <I>Three Cantos 1</I> that Browning "Watched the
'soul,' Sordello's soul, / And saw it lap up life, and swell and burst-- /
'Into the empyrean?,'" he comments not only on the dialectic dynamic of
hope and doubt, strife for transcendence and anticipation of annihilation,
that Browning's poem emplots to its last moment. Browning's version
of Sordello's life, the swelling and bursting of Sordello's soul, is
an existentialist account of the poet's designs to embody the world in
his poetry. The fact of death that explodes the meaning of individual
intent becomes a metaphor for the dispersion of the textualized authorial
self--Eglamor's, Sordello's, Browning's-- among all the texts that crowd
human history.

 re. Pound recognizes that in order to rewrite <I>Sordello</I>,
 he first of all needs to construct an answer to Browning's question:
 "Have ye times, places, actors of your own?" because in Browning those
 times, actors, and places function as part and parcel, material and
 structural devices, of his enterprise. Browning

reiterates and brings to life structural aspects of an original past
that highlight contemporary concerns of social and cultural transition
and renewal (<I>S</I>, 3, 937). Browning's post-Romantic experimentation
with the epic form involved choosing as a hero an eminent cultural and
political re from the transition between the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance. Browning then turns this re's career into that of a
poet-antihero. He creates a narrative that presents the individual poet's
struggle within the twilight of its time, with the light of the past
(antiquity) shining beyond the present darkness (of medieval turmoil):

Pound is afraid of being a "naif Ficinus," the fifteenth-century
Italian translator of Plato who drew on mythology the wrong way by
"creating a systematic allegory of already allegorized and unfeared gods"
(<I>GEPC</I>, 136). Recourse to history must not be stale and deadening,
but vitalizing, an example for the avant-garde. As Pound suggests in
both <I>Three Cantos 1</I> and <I>2</I>, the Renaissance as a stale
"<I>d&eacute;cor</I>" (<I>P</I>, 234) will not do, and his quest for
backgrounds leads him back to more vital origins. Pound here samples
various original historical backgrounds potentially available to him:
Egypt and its primitive power of art, Western and Biblical mythology
(the potential ineffectiveness of whose montage Ficinus had given an
example of) as they prere modern science, and ancient Asian cultures,
the contemplative dynamic of Chinese philosophy from the sixteenth
century B. C. onward, and the seductiveness of Japanese aesthetics and
religion, penetrating everyday life with "emblems of divine perception"
(<I>GEPC</I>, 138).
<SUP><A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The <I>Three Cantos</I> proceed to find ways to overlay all these diverse
 backgrounds "ply over ply"--a term describing both poetic technique and
 a certain perception of reality that Pound cites from <I>Sordello</I>
 (<I>S</I>, 5, 163) in <I>Three Cantos 2</I> (<I>P</I>, 236), and found
 poignant enough to insert again in the eventual Canto 4 and Canto 17

Pound's layering of historical and literary texts and rhyming of
subjects and images, to borrow from Hugh Kenner's notion of Pound's
"subject-rhymes," is a method that, <I>in nuce</I>, <I>Sordello</I>
foreshadows both in its narrative technique and techniques of allusion.
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The path that Browning's image of the "ruined palace step" takes within
 the genesis of <I>The Cantos</I> is a good example of how Pound was
 inspired by Browning's clustering, juxtaposition, and rhyming of images
 and themes. Browning opens his poem to such poetic experimentation by
 more often than not disrupting the linearity of the narrative process
 and the unity of place and time for the sake of capturing the workings
 of consciousness, its flux through jarring states of mind. Browning
 presents, for instance, most of Sordello's life in an extended flashback
 that, in Book 1, allows him immediately to juxtapose the scenarios of
 Verona (and Ferrara, superimposed) and Goito, and the contrasting states
 of mind dramatized by them. For similar purposes he reworks structures of
 epic and sacred narrative, such as employed by Homer and Dante, and of
 medieval romance, particularly the structures of departure and return.
 Sordello takes off from Goito twice, pushes toward immersion in the
 "out-world" twice, and both his journeys bring him full circle, with all
 scenarios of the past ultimately being mentally present in <I>Sordello
 6</I>. In a similar vein, <I>Sordello 5</I> reiterates the events of
 <I>Sordello 4</I>, replacing temporal progress with a heightening of
 narrative awareness. In such ways Browning's narrative strategies,
 which at times even foreshadow twentieth-century film techniques,
 may have prepared Pound for negotiating those of Joyce.

It seems safe to agree with Gibson that, while Pound's materials
varied and sources of influence were numerous, principles of thought and
composition that crystallize in his dialogue with <I>Sordello</I> remained
vivid beyond <I>Three Cantos</I>. The allusions to Browning retained in
the final version of <I>The Cantos</I>, even if more condensed and covert

<B></B>

than in <I>Three Cantos 1</I>, are crucial, and the technique Pound
develops through his revisions structurally owes more than is acknowledged
to Browning's <I>Sordello</I>. The version of <I>Three Cantos</I>'s
opening apostrophe that survives as the beginning of Canto 2 suggests
that what Pound cut was an initial analysis and discussion no longer
necessary after he had found his own way of doing a <I>Sordello</I>:

The last line, taken from the first line of one of Sordello's <I>Vitae</I>
("Sordello was from Mantua"), poses an answer to the preceding
question. Browning found his way to Sordello through reading Dante, and
subsequently extended his research on twelfth- and thirteenth-century
culture and history to construct a new character. After penetrating
<I>Sordello</I>, Pound also will move further back, to origins, primary
texts, and documents, and assemble them with new authenticity, in his
own idiom.

"Und &uuml;berhaupt ich stamm aus Browning. Pourquoi nier son
p&egrave;re," writes Pound to Ren&eacute; Taupin from Vienna in May 1928,
expounding his literary affiliations and ambitions.
<SUP><A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 This statement openly rejects anxiety of influence, belying, in German,
 the great Viennese school of Oedipal psychology with an untormented
 frankness very much in character for a poet whose critical writings
 point out writers held worthy to influence others, and whose own
 poetry explicitly relies on methods of imitation, intertextual
 commentary, pastiche, and translation, both in the literal and the
 widest senses. A close look at the German, however, reveals that Pound
 refers to his "father" not so much as a precursor self but as a place
 of origin; instead of "Ich stamme von Browning ab"--I am a descendant of
 Browning--he writes, "<I>Ich stamme aus Browning"</I>--I am <I>from</I>
 Browning, "ing" being a common ending of Germanic place names. This is
 surely not a slip on Pound's part. Anxiety of influence, one might argue,
 is "displaced" here in a peculiar sense of the word, as Browning becomes
 part of a geography--perhaps at the same time the ahistorical geography
 of extant texts and the nostalgic, historical geography of origin,
 departure, and return--rather than of a genealogy. Pound's poetic self,
 in turn, is thus constructed as geographical or textual, as divested of
 a fleshly or affective personality. Like Browning who emerges from and
 returns to the "lagune" of his poem, Pound, in re-working Browning's
 work, depicts himself as a disembodied consciousness arising from and
 shaping a literary landscape (<I>S</I>, 3, 607-15).

Pound began reading <I>Sordello</I> in the Fall of 1904 and kept returning
to it until, around 1915, he felt he had understood it sufficiently to see
in it a starting point for his own <I>Cantos</I>, according to Humphrey
Carpenter, <I>A Serious Character: The Life of Ezra Pound</I> (New York:
Delta, 1988), 55). "I began to get it on about the 6th reading," Pound

As in "Mesmerism," Pound's parody of Browning entails elements of
self-parody. In these lines, Pound uses details from Troubadour history
related to Browning's in <I>Sordello</I>, namely details from Bertrans
de Born's life and work. At the time, Pound himself drew heavily on this
background, most recently in "Near Perigord" (see below).

"swanzig," a comic spelling of German "zwanzig" (twenty), quibbles on
the peculiar sound of "Zanze," possibly Browning's rendering of "Zante,"
either the name of a Greek island or of a flower (as in Edgar Allan Poe's
"Sonnet to Zante" of 1837).

"Il miglior fabbro," Chap. 2 in <I>The Spirit of Romance</I> (New
York: New Directions, 1968), 22-38. Writing of the "trick" of the
"unfinished address," Pound may have had in mind a number of Daniel's
shorter poems (translations of which Pound first published in 1911 and
1912) that, like <I>Sordello</I>, open with a few lines in which the
poet addresses his audience on the topic of his art. See Ezra Pound,
<I>Ezra Pound: Translations</I> [New York: New Directions, 1970],
416-18, 420-25. Many of Pound's own short poems between 1913
and 1915 experiment with this device. The addresses could be considered
"unfinished," because they are not developed throughout the poem toward
a closure.

This vicious circle closes for the first time in Book 2, when Sordello's
first attempt at achieving a new aesthetic is marred by its intrinsic
difficulty. The fruit of Sordello's effort at Mantua betrays his labor,
"Because perceptions whole, like that he sought / To clothe, rejects so
pure a work of thought / As language," making his poetry so difficult
to comprehend that its deeper meanings completely escape his audience
(<I>S</I>, 2, 659; <I>S</I>, 2, 589--91). "Sundered in twain," the
aspiring poet-self split from the "Man," Sordello retires to Goito,
where "the stain / Of the world forsakes Sordello, with its pain / Its
pleasure," and in the very effort to heal himself--"Quiet those throbbing
temples, then subdue / That cheek's distortion"--he falls into depression
and passivity (<I>S</I>, 3, 15-17; <I>S</I>, 3, 5-8).

Some of <I>Sordello</I>'s lines read like directions from a screenplay:

The quoted lines, still closely connected to Browning's materials,
"rhyme" with the end of Canto 6, where, after juggling references to
Homer and Proven&ccedil;al history, Pound epitomizes Sordello's life
by direct recourse to the chronicles and Sordello's poetry. By 1934,
notwithstanding his own difficulty in grasping <I>Sordello</I>, Pound
cited it as an example of "narrative limpidity" and poetic ease (Pound,
<I>The ABC of Reading</I>, 188-91). Whereas "Victorian half-wits
claimed this poem was obscure," he maintains that Browning's verse was
"without clog and verbal impediment." To prove this he chooses passages
that are relatively easy to follow. Evidently he is out to shatter
prejudice against Browning--but perhaps also against the difficult idiom
he had developed out of his engagement with Browning's.

In 1915 Pound acknowledges his earlier work's debt to Browning's and adds
that studying Browning's achievement is necessary to understanding Pound's
own enterprise. "If you like <I>Perigord</I>," he tells his father,
"you would probably like Browning's <I>Sordello</I>. . . . You'll have
to read it sometime as my big long endless poem that I am now struggling
with, starts off with a barrelful of allusions to <I>Sordello</I> which
will intrigue you if you haven't read the other" (quoted in Bornstein,
<I>Ezra Pound Among the Poets</I>, 137).
