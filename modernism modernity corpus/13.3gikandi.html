<p id="lead">Sometime in the early 1960s, David Rubadiri, a Malawian student and then lecturer at Makerere University College in Uganda published a poem entitled "Stanley Meets Mutesa." The poem, one of the most anthologized in collections of African poetry, had a theme that was familiar in the early days of postcolonial literature: the encounter between Europe and Africa, the colonizer and the colonized. Rubadiri's poem, in both its key theme and movement, drew heavily on the history of late-nineteenth-century colonialism in East Africa, more particularly the arrival of the Anglo-American imperialist, Henry Morton Stanley, to the Kingdom of Buganda. The poem is, indeed, most memorable in its last stanza, which allegorizes the entry of the west in the world of the other:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"Mtu mweupe karibu" <br />
White man you are welcome, <br />
The gate of reeds closes behind them  <br />
And the west is let in.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>These, the last four lines of the poem, have come to signal the doubleness of the postcolonial literary project, namely the imperative to mark a space of local identity in the language of the other and to reroute the signifiers of colonialism. Rubadiri's poem is in English, except the one line that signals the entry of the colonizer&#x2014;"Mtu mweupe karibu"&#x2014;which is in Swahili. Significantly, Rubadiri does not let this line stand out as the mark of African identity or self-inscription; in fact the line that follows&#x2014;"White man you are welcome"&#x2014;is a direct translation 

<b></b>

of the line in Swahili. The colonial event is thus represented as a form of alien invasion, which is, nevertheless, controlled through linguistic gestures. For Rubadiri and many of his contemporaries, it was in this play of alienation and identification that postcolonial difference would be inscribed.  </p>

<p>Beneath the allegorization of the colonial encounter, however, there was something else happening in Rubadiri's poem: it was recounting the African encounter with Europe, and indeed recuperating that fatal moment of history when Stanley met Mutesa, in the language of modernism. A remarkable but often forgotten feature of Rubadiri's celebrated poem is how its denotation of an African version of history is effected through the language of high modernism. This is evident in the very first stanza of the poem, which recounts Stanley's journey through the African landscape:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Such a time of it they had <br />
The heat of the day <br />
The chill of the night <br />
And the mosquitoes <br />
That day and night <br />
Trailed the march bound for a kingdom.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Readers of these lines will, of course, recognize the influence of T. S. Eliot. In its structure, rhythm, and imagery, "Stanley Meets Mutesa" borrows heavily from Eliot's "The Journey of the Magi." The above stanza bears a striking similarity to the famous opening of Eliot's poem: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"A cold coming we had of it, <br />
Just the worst time of the year <br />
For a journey, and such a long journey: <br />
The ways deep and the weather sharp, <br />
The very dead of winter."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>The great irony of the history of postcolonial literatures was the emulation of high modernists, such as Eliot and Yeats, as formal models. This emulation was explicit, as the poetry of Rubadiri and Christopher Okigbo illustrates, but it could also be indirect and epigraphic, as in Chinua Achebe's derivation of a title and epigraph from Yeat's "Second Coming" for <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, and from "The Journey of the Magi" in <i>No Longer at Ease</i>. As the essays in this special issue of  vividly illustrate, a convergence of political and literary ideologies mark a significant part of the history of modernism and postcolonialism. Indeed, it is my contention that it was primarily&#x2014;I am tempted to say solely&#x2014;in the language and structure of modernism that a postcolonial experience came to be articulated and imagined in literary form. The archive of early postcolonial writing in Africa, the Caribbean, and India is dominated and defined by writers whose political or cultural projects were enabled by modernism even when the ideologies of the latter, as was the case with Eliot, were at odds with the project of decolonization.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Eliot's "The Journey of the Magi" did not attract African 

<b></b>

and Caribbean writers because of its high Anglicanist bent; rather, it was the structure of the journey, the revised dramatic monologue, and the use of classical allusions that an emergent postcolonial aesthetic found appealing.  </p>

<p>Still, it is fair to say that the history of late modernity, both in the West and in the postcolonies, has been marked by continuing ambivalence toward the relationship between the aesthetic ideology of high modernism and the spaces of the colonial and postcolonial other. Whether we look at it from the perspective of high European culture in the period after World War II, or from the vantage point of postcoloniality in the same period, debates about modernism are marked by a double paradox. The first paradox lies at the root of the recovery and institution of modernism in the twentieth century: modernism represents perhaps the most intense and unprecedented site of encounter between the institutions of European cultural production and the cultural practices of colonized peoples. It is rare to find a central text in modern literature, art, or ethnography that does not deploy the other as a significant source, influence, or informing analogy. And the relationship between the institution of modernism and these other cultural spaces is not, as was the case in earlier periods of European art, decorative: it is dynamic, dialectical, and constitutive of the field of European and American culture.  </p>

<p>Indeed, what differentiates modernism from other European encounters with the cultural spaces and practices of the colonized is the recognition, by modern writers and artists, that those others could, even in economies of difference and Eurocentrism, provide important lessons for a new ideology of art. This point has, of course, been the subject of revisionist works on the history of modernism. The paradox, though, is that in spite of this visible engagement with the culture of the other, modernism is now remembered and recycled in the public culture&#x2014;in the museums, mausoleums and libraries built by a powerful and wealthy cultural elite&#x2014;as the art of exclusiveness. Indeed, the modern art museum has become a mechanism for policing the boundaries between modernism, now redefined as the emblem of European high culture, and the messier, lower, cultures that enabled it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The association between modernism and an exclusive elite culture leads to a second paradox: for almost fifty years, postcolonial critics and scholars have treated modernism with suspicion. Indeed, it is fair to say that postcolonial criticism has posited modernism as the site of Eurocentric danger, a threat to the assumed authenticity of the cultural and literary traditions of postcolonial polities. Quite often, modernism has been seen as the art form of an alienated cultural elite, eager to master European form at the expense of local traditions of writing and thus placed at odds with the political project of decolonization.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The paradox here, of course, is that without modernism, postcolonial literature as we know it would perhaps not exist. This is a bold claim to make, and I am sure it will be debated and disputed by many postcolonial scholars.  </p>

<p>But consider these simple facts. There is not much literature in the European languages in either Africa, the Caribbean, or India before the advent of modernism. While there is no simple explanation for this paucity, it can be directly connected to the operations of the English canon propagated by the colonial school and university 

<b></b>

as both sacred and inimitable. Colonial subjects were avid consumers of the canon, but within the colonial institutions of interpretation, they were taught that this canon represented the values of an innate Englishness, one that was anterior to their own sense of self, as lesser subjects of empire. One could read English texts to have a glimpse of the superiority of English culture; one could imagine what Chaucer's road to Canterbury may have looked like; one could struggle to visualize the daffodil in Wordsworth's poems; but eventually one would have to accept that those experiences were beyond one's measure. Reflecting on why West Indian writers of his generation had to leave the Caribbean in order to become writers, the Barbadian novelist, George Lamming, noted that they had to leave because in the colonial conception of literature books were "not supposed to be-written by natives": "Those among the natives who read also believed that; for all the books they had read, their whole introduction to something called culture, all of it, in the form of words, came from outside: Dickens, Jane Austen, Kipling and that 'sacred gang.' "<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It is when modernism was introduced into the canon, sometimes reluctantly, that postcolonial creativity bloomed. For example, the renaissance of African writing at the end of the 1950s started at University College, Ibadan, and University College, Makerere (both branches of the University of London) when two expatriate lecturers&#x2014;Molly Mahood and David Cooke&#x2014;introduced young African students to the literature of modernism in the 1950s. Although Mahood had been seconded to Ibadan as a Shakespearean, she sponsored a literary magazine called <i>New Horn</i> devoted to literary experimentation, using modernist poems as models. It was here that young poets such as J. P. Clarke, Wole Soyinka, and Christopher Okigbo used the model of modernism to create a postcolonial African literature.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>   </p>

<p>There are three narratives involved in the transnational reach of modernism, and this special issue of  captures them well. The first is how modernism, as a transnational phenomenon, invites a reconration of the time and space of modernity. Many of the essays here illustrate what happens when critical energy is directed at the roles played by ostensible margins in the constitution of cultural centers. All the essays in this collection provide compelling, reversionary accounts of modernism outside its traditional boundaries. And when it is placed in an uneasy relation to other spaces, modernism seems to recover its drive as the aesthetic of the international avant-garde and in the process to reject its ossification as the aesthetic ideology of high European culture. In "Periodizing Modernism," for example, Susan Friedman reconres the dialectic of periodicity in modernism, dispersing what was once assumed to be its obsessive preoccupation with time by confronting it with the presence and pressures of other spaces. Similarly, in "Modernist Bricolage," Jahan Ramazani reflects on key instances in which postcolonial poets name, rename, and even de-name the signature sites of modernism and relocate the imagination to a "a free-floating noumen," a space that is neither global nor local but somewhere in between. Friedman and Ramazani show how postcolonial writers came to produce a literature that transformed the terms of modernism itself.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>A second narrative of global modernism is evident in the rerouting of modernity through a set of texts that might initially appear to be marginal to its economy. Urmila Seshagiri's essay on Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> is exemplary in this regard: Through a careful archeology of the text and its context, she shows how Rhys, coming from the colonial margins, was able to turn modernist experimentation into a medium of cultural transition and in the process to use the resources of modernism to enable a postcolonial aesthetics. A similar reversionary gesture is evident in Jessica Berman's comparative reading of Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as A Young Man</i> and Mulk Raj Anand's <i>Untouchable</i>. It is often assumed that after his ill-fated adventure in Bloomsbury and under the tutelage of Gandhi, Anand abandoned the project of modernism in favor of a hard driven realism, which, he hoped, would enable him to represent the lives of the Indian poor. But what Berman shows convincingly is that underneath the realism of novels such as <i>Untouchable</i> was a redeployment of the Joycean concept of self-development in the literature of colonial disenchantment; a concept that, for Anand, could be transported to the world of the Indian poor. Anand did not reject Joyce, he just translated his methods to respond to the pressures of late colonialism. In the process, Anand, like the other postcolonial writers discussed in this volume, extended the language and structure of modernism in what might initially appear to be its disavowal. </p>

<p>A final narrative in these essays reopens the old question of the political agency of modernism. We are now so used to thinking about modernism either as an apolitical movement or as the aesthetic ideology of fascism, that we often forget how its practitioners were at the forefront of the international struggle against colonialism and racism in the first half of the twentieth century. As Laura Winkiel notes in her examination of the transnational politics of race in Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro</i>, the ideal of experimentation in modernism could be extended into the field of social relationships. We may debate the motives behind Cunard's public engagement with black writers and artists, but her anthology constitutes a remarkable gathering of the major res in the aesthetic of Pan-Africanism. Cunard turned to modernism and blackness to escape the prison house of Eurocentrism and privilege, but her anthology was the first to give a voice to transnational blackness. The crossing of racial, cultural, and sexual geographies, as Laura Doyle informs us in her comparative study of queer racial subjectivity in the works of Virginia Woolf and Nella Larsen was an invitation to rethink the matrixes that had created the Atlantic world as a space of identity and difference. In both these cases&#x2014;Cunard's anthology and queer subjectivity&#x2014;race provided the logic that simultaneously authorized and deconstructed our ideas of modernism and modernity. In this regard, we can say that modernism, having freed the European subject from the tutelage of tradition, also opened the space in which the other could become a self-reflective subject.
