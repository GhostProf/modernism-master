<p>
	  My epigraph, from a chapter in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Man without Qualities</span> titled “Cultural Revolution,” has an equivocal tone that would appear to be lacking in Ezra Pound’s exhortation “Make It New.” Of the three terms, <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> seems concrete and unambiguous. The verb is forceful (action verbs were an <span style="font-style:italic;">idée fixe</span> for Pound). But what is “it”? Squeezed between <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span>, those brawny avatars, it would be ludicrous to suppose some veiled reference to aura or star power of the sort that made flapper and film star Clara Bow the “‘It’ girl” on the strength of pulp novelist Elinor Glyn’s thesis in <span style="font-style:italic;">It</span> . One would more sensibly take <span style="font-style:italic;">it</span> to be an artwork, given Pound’s avocation. But considering the ubiquity of references to this famous phrase, it’s surprising to realize that <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> was not published until 1934, when Pound was immersed in politics and economics. In Canto LIII, he commemorated the Chinese emperor Tching Tang [Ch’êng T’ang], founder of the Shang Dynasty in the eighteenth century, who in Pound’s account “wrote MAKE IT NEW / on his bath tub / Day by day make it new.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this context, the <span style="font-style:italic;">it</span> in question concerns statecraft. Pound’s—or Tching Tang’s—adage has populated countless accounts of modernism, and it may be the most frequently repeated quip of the early twentieth century. It’s succinct, memorable, and relevant. But it’s also slightly anachronistic, for the steady drumbeat of The New preceded <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> by several decades—during which Pound himself  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contributed to the polyrhythm of its allure. With the migratory tenacity of a virus, this adjective fertilized the avant-garde wherever it landed. In what follows, I trace its persistence without being overly scrupulous in distinguishing one movement from another, for it seems to me there’s something to be learned from a signifier for difference that could be so widely adopted that the differences spread beyond distinction or accountability. It’s as if <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> was the very model of Gertrude Stein’s carafe or “blind glass” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span>, “a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Before reviewing the spectrum of exhortations, it’s best to set some outer limits (the <span style="font-style:italic;">inner</span> limits charted here date roughly from 1912 to 1934). In 1895, Paul Gauguin invited August Strindberg to write the preface for an exhibition catalogue. The Swede had keenly felt the power of Gauguin’s canvases (“I saw on the walls of your studio an uproar of sunlit pictures, which pursued me in my sleep”), and though he turned down the invitation, Strindberg conceded: “I am beginning to feel an immense need for becoming savage and creating a new world.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Two years later Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler, addressing “The Mission of the Artist,” concluded: “The work of art will reveal the perception of a new order in things.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Despite the burgeoning appearance of art nouveau, reference to the “new” as validation was not widespread at that point. Nearly fifty years later the exiled German Surrealist artist Wolfgang Paalen published “The New Image” in his magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">DYN</span> in 1942, in which he affirmed the definitive crossing over (as if on some aesthetic Aleutian Strait) of representational art into the domain of pure abstraction. For Hodler and Paalen alike, <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> was a term for the unforeseen—and even the unforeseeable.
	</p>
<p>
	  But what about the intervening decades? References were numerous, and not necessarily uncoordinated. The new generation was a predictable reference, but generations were a familiar way of specifying historical difference since Stendhal’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Rouge et le noir</span> if not earlier. <span style="font-style:italic;">This</span> difference, the <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> clearly underway by 1912, was felt to be decisive. The new spirit, the new form, the new reality, the new object, new facts, new organisms, new life, new values, a new world, new cosmos, new society, new culture or civilization, new era or epoch, new time and new age, to which the new consciousness and enhanced susceptibility would respond with a new sensitivity, a new corporeality, a new psychology aroused by new sensations; and these would give rise, naturally, to a new aesthetics, a new beauty—a new realism and a new archaism, enforced by a new rhythm—arising from new means and new methods: a new art, architecture, plastic expression, poetry, literature, new words and new language, music, drama, new optic realms, a new vision, a <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span>. . . . The alacrity required to dispel the old order was audacious and impulsive, but it could always be called New.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  William Carlos Williams observed, with obstetric care, the inaugural moment:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  They enter the new world naked,
	<br>
	  cold, uncertain of all
	<br>
	  save that they enter<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Williams’s medical expertise lends particular weight to his observational acuity, with the implied corollary that any historical nativity must also encounter its new world as cold naked fact: disarming, “the stark dignity of / entrance.” Hugo Ball experienced a comparable reverence for the surprising turn of events at Cabaret Voltaire in 1916: “There is a gnostic sect whose initiates were so stunned by the image of the <span style="font-style:italic;">childhood</span> of Jesus,” he wrote in his diary, “that they lay down in a cradle and let themselves be suckled by women and swaddled. The dadaists are similar babes-in-arms of a new age.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The following week Ball would intone the childlike syllables, “gadji beri bimba,” in a liturgical commemoration of this impromptu rejuvenation. When he carried the germ of dada from Zurich to Berlin, Richard Huelsenbeck likewise coupled apocalyptic rhetoric with natal deliverance: “The new man transforms the polyhysteria of the age into a genuine understanding of all things and a healthy sensuality.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> A cautionary respect for the paroxysmal delivery of a new order—exemplified by Williams and Ball—should be borne in mind when reviewing that euphoric insistence, <span style="font-style:italic;">make it new</span>, in any of its prodigious versions.
	</p>
<p>
	  Before the war, proclamations of the new proliferated promiscuously, but there were certain concentrated efforts to make it into the rallying cry for a cause. The Italian futurists, of course, were pioneers, as were the Russian futurists. German expressionist discourse was infused with apocalyptic acclamations of the new, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blue Rider</span> almanac was its most emphatic announcement. The Great War interrupted what was becoming a crescendo, but the very fact of the war—and the need to surmount whatever had given rise to it—lent renewed credence to the cause. A new order would have to succeed the atrocities, and during the 1920s De Stijl and the principles of constructivism reinforced this outlook. Although there could always be a tinge of it, <span style="font-style:italic;">novelty</span> was never really at the root of the new as a choral refrain. With nearly a century of commercial novelties standing between us and the modernist exhortation to Make It New, product endorsements and marketing strategies tend to infiltrate our historical hindsight. But commercial considerations were hardly the issue for the avant-garde, whose pronouncements were pledges of faith in the collective potential of new initiatives in the arts. These avowals tacitly shared the tautological conviction of Marijam Mikac in Serbia : “Zenitism is a new movement in the arts. As such, Zenitism is revolutionary.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Pound’s famous imperative may have been a late addition to the rhetorical arsenal, but it’s worth recalling that Pound’s own investment in artistic renaissance dates back to the initiating fervor of futurism. At that time Pound was a frequent contributor to <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>, edited by A. R. Orage, but the title is strictly symbolic, as <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> had little to do with the actual new age into which it fitfully persisted (“To this day I haven’t the faintest idea who <span style="font-style:italic;">read</span> that paper,” Pound recalled. “The only man I ever met who had seen my stuff in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Age</span> was an admiral”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a>). Nevertheless, it was in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> that Pound ventured his awareness of a characteristic preoccupation among his peers: “And the ‘new form.’ What is it?” he wondered. “It is not a mimicry of external life. It is energy cut into stone”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a>—a definition reflecting the monumental aspirations realized in Gaudier-Brzeska’s hieratic head of the poet. In this same year, 1915, the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Imagist Poets</span> appeared, to which Pound refused to contribute (wary of its democratic editorial procedure—but also because he had gone on to vorticism, that truculent amalgamation of futurism and cubism and, in a way, “a stricter form of Imagism”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a>). An unsigned Preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Imagist Poets</span> unreservedly adopts the pledge of the new: “To create new rhythms—as the expression of new moods—and not to copy old rhythms, which merely echo old moods,” because “In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Unbeknownst to the Imagists, the cubo-futurists in Moscow had already foresworn textbook metrics, declaring that “every motion generates for the poet a new free rhythm.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Among the signatories to this initiative were Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov and Alexsei Kruchenykh, whose poetic practices were far more radical than anything imagined elsewhere. Khlebnikov had already published his famous poem “Incantation by Laughter” in 1910, and Kruchenykh’s experiments in <span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span> or transrational language were underway by 1913. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Declaration of the Word As Such</span> , Kruchenykh insisted: “A new verbal form creates a new content, and not vice versa” (RF, 68). In another proclamation from the same year, he hammered the point home with added insistence: “Invent new native words! A new content <span style="font-style:italic;">becomes manifest only</span> when new expressive devices are achieved, a new form. Once there is a new form, a new content follows; form thus conditions content” . Not only was a new content at stake: “in order to depict the new—the future—one needs <span style="font-style:italic;">totally new words and a new way of combining them</span>” (RF, 72). This was a step beyond Mallarmé’s purification of the dialect of the tribe. Although neologism had always been a prerogative of poets and wits alike, it was indisputably new to claim as the poet’s special vocation a veritable replenishment of language from root to branch. Compared to the Russians, other exhortations to renew poetry could sound vague, if emphatic. “For a new world, new poetry,” Nicolas Beauduin urged in <span style="font-style:italic;">Vie des Lettres</span> in 1913.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Even Pound staked his claim on a hazy domain of “new emotions” alert to “new vibrations” as the poet’s prerogative.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> By the watershed year of 1913 the sense of an imminent new age was palpable: with utopian audacity, the cubo-futurists declared “We are the new people of a new life” (RF, 54). Inimitably put by Khlebnikov: “We rang for room service and the year 1913 answered: it gave Planet Earth a valiant new race of people, the heroic Futurians.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As with Italian futurist rhetoric, artistic license saturates these declamations, which may be construed as the artistic equivalent of pre-game warm-ups by athletes. The nature of the game was unclear, but it was hard to resist the siren call of modernity blaring from every city boulevard. Huntly Carter pondered the terminological equivocation in 1913:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    This Age, for instance, we regard as the Age of the New. But it is not to be confounded with the new age, which is quite another thing. Perhaps the latter is the one new thing under the sun. Unfortunately, we are unable to speak definitely on the subject, seeing that the term New Age is a dancing call to Utopia.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p>
	  Heeding that dancing call, most were impervious to Carter’s equivocation between the enticement of novelty and the dawn of a new age, for which Virginia Woolf famously posited a date: December 1910, marking the Grafton Gallery show of “Manet and the Post-Impressionists” in London (which fittingly opened on Guy Fawkes Day). This memorable occasion provoked much abuse in the press—“the pictures are evil,” “Van Gogh is the typical matoid and degenerate of the modern sociologist”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>—and even consternation among the intelligentsia (E. M. Forster, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">Howards End</span> had recently been published, was unsettled by the work on display). But as Arnold Bennett caustically observed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>, “The mild tragedy of the thing is that London is infinitely too self-complacent even to suspect that it is London and not the exhibition which is making itself ridiculous,” given that “the value of the best work of this new school is permanently and definitely settled—outside London.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Woolf’s canonical date, it turns out, attests mainly to a parochial panic in the world’s imperial capital.
	</p>
<p>
	  The Grafton Gallery event exposed Londoners to painting that had already long since provoked the innovations of cubism, expressionism, and futurism, examples of which did not reach England until the “Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition” in 1912, “Modern German Art” in 1913, and “Italian Futurist Painters” in 1914. Shortly thereafter, all such provocations would have the period feel of <span style="font-style:italic;">pre-war</span>. There has been no end of recalling the martial rhetoric of the futurists; but the genuinely <span style="font-style:italic;">apocalyptic</span> fervor was German. Consider the eschatological vocabulary to which Franz Marc resorted in the subscription prospectus for <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Blaue Reiter</span>: “We stand before the new pictures as in a dream and we hear the apocalyptic horsemen in the air. There is an artistic tension all over Europe. Everywhere new artists are greeting each other.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> “Today the new movement emerges from all quarters with fundamental power and unanimity,” wrote Marc in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pan</span>. “It is not a Parisian event, but a European movement.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Assimilating the Parisian vocabulary applied to the fauves, Marc characterized the primitivist urgency of his German colleagues:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    In this time of the great struggle for a new art we t like disorganized ‘savages’ against an old, established power. The battle seems to be unequal, but spiritual matters are never decided by numbers, only by the power of ideas. The dreaded weapons of the ‘savages’ are their <span style="font-style:italic;">new ideas</span>.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (BR, 61)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    What’s most arresting here is the almost imperceptible shift in focus from merely aesthetic adversaries to a less palpable, but no less imposing intransigence to which the artist has no alternative but to take up arms, making art a weapon. The inducement to artistic savagery finds its most urgent expression in Marc’s foreword to the never completed second volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Blaue Reiter</span>: “The world is giving birth to a new time; there is only one question: has the time now come to separate ourselves from the old world? Are we ready for the <span style="font-style:italic;">vita nuova</span>? This is the terrifying question of our age” (BR, 260).
	  </p>
<p>
	    The exhilarating burden of renewal was hardly exclusive to expressionism. “Since we have to <span style="font-style:italic;">re-create everything anew</span>, we Futurists are forced to make a far greater effort than any other revolutionaries who have appeared on the scene of Art,” wrote  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Boccioni.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Considering the exalted stakes, the rhetorical sallies of the Italian Futurists reveal in their unabashed bluster the need to work up the nerve and take the plunge into modernity. Furthermore, the futurist cause was agitated by visits to Paris, that capital of modernity; so when they spoke of “the exciting new psychology of night-life,” Boccioni could be confident that “Today modernity is using—in advertisements, newspapers, sketches and caricatures—a new kind of basic dynamic norm” (FM, 25, 153), affirming with Marinetti that “from the chaos of contradictory new sensibilities a new beauty is being born.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Man “multiplied by the machine” would achieve some “new mechanical sense, a fusion of instinct with the efficiency of motors” (FM, 97). Nicolas Beauduin, proponent of paroxysme, shared Marinetti’s prognosis: “the revelation of a new man, the machine man, the multiplied man, has appeared to us.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Paul Schmidt, writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span> in 1912, summarized a general consensus with this enthymeme: “The very fact that the new exists demonstrates its necessity” (GE, 14). Appraisals and specific applications emanated accordingly from different quarters. Luigi Russolo promoted his <span style="font-style:italic;">Art of Noises</span>  as a way to “enrich men with a new and unexpected sensual pleasure” (FM, 86). Architecture, the futurist Sant’Elia insisted, “must be new, just as our state of mind is new” (FM, 169). For Paul Scheerbart, it was specifically glass architecture that would give rise to a new environment, a new culture. “It is a joy to live in our times and whoever does not sense this cannot be helped,” declared Bruno Taut (GE, 124). Citing the rise of pictorial abstraction and the influence of architectural principles on the plastic arts, Taut promoted the Gothic cathedral as a model for the new synthesis, much as the Bauhaus would take its name from the Bauhütte, seasonal domiciles of cathedral builders. “There is a necessity implicit in this new art that requires the union of architecture, painting, and sculpture” (GE, 125).
	  </p>
<p>
	    Comparable attestations could be cited with exhausting redundancy. Even during the war, <span style="font-style:italic;">news</span> of the (prior) new fitfully persisted, blossoming with renewed vigor after the armistice. Consider the ongoing absorption of cubism, not to mention the trickle of impressionism into regional American art as late as the Thirties. Because such influences were rarely unilateral, involving not only temporal and geographical distance, but refractory forms of agency from publications to personal anecdotes, temporal priority in the domain of the avant-garde is misleading. Even so heralded a term as “futurism” precedes its indelible association with Russian and Italian proponents, having been coined by Majorcan writer Gabriel Alomar in 1904, a full five years before Marinetti’s inaugural manifesto.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In fact, two journals titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurisme</span> were published in Spain prior to the “founding” Italian event (launched in Paris in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>): one in Barcelona in 1907, another in Terrassa in 1908. However strident their declarations, vanguard movements could only precariously lay claim to the new; and while he approvingly anticipated his own obsolescence (“Quand nous aurons quarante ans, que de plus jeunes et plus vaillants que nous veuillent bien nous jeter au panier comme des manuscrits inutiles!”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a>), Marinetti bore the burden of his movement for the rest of his life—a sisyphean labor inflecting <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span> with <span style="font-style:italic;">keep on trucking</span>. As Pound’s declaration suggested in its original Chinese context, the new was more likely to reflect individual rather than collective effort. Before the war, nothing exemplified  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this more readily than cubism, that non- or anti-movement that increasingly signified a threshold event. Before and after.
	  </p>
<p>
	    “It is my firm conviction that <span style="font-style:italic;">Picasso’s art must have as its consequence a new aesthetics and a new attitude to life</span>,” Max Raphael exclaimed in 1912.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Apollinaire raised the stakes a year later in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cubist Painters</span>, when he hailed Picasso as nothing less than “a new man, and the world is his way of representing it.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Picasso’s fellow pioneer, Georges Braque, concisely identified their legacy: “New means. New subjects.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The fruit of cubism was the creative restlessness expressed by Robert Delaunay: “I know all the old techniques. I want the new, the living, the unprecedented.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The unprecedented quickly reached flood levels everywhere, arriving at an exemplary limit in 1917 after “R. Mutt” (Marcel Duchamp, former cubist) submitted a urinal to a purportedly open exhibition of independent artists in New York, only to have it turned down. “Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance,” was Duchamp’s retort in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man.</span> “He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view—created a new thought for that object.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> The specificity of Duchamp’s formula—<span style="font-style:italic;">a new thought</span> for the object—anticipates a rhetorical shift that would accelerate after the war.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Before the war, proclamations of the new tended toward the generic, affirming the impact of modernity in everyday life while urging a corresponding transformation of art. Consider two such declarations from 1914, both by painters. Max Beckmann: “there is within me what I sense as new, new from this age and its spirit.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Fernand Léger: “A new criterion has appeared in response to a new state of things.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Equally open or vague exhortations persisted after the war, of course—“For a new world, a new art” (Cendrars)<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a>; “Art creates a new reality” (Janco)<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a>—but the stakes had changed. Years of senseless slaughter, combined with the political fluidity of revolutionary circumstances unfolding in Russia, Germany, and Hungary, suddenly endowed “the new” with concrete utopian content. “The recent war,” observed Juan Chabás y Martí in “Orientations to the Post-War,” “marks a new Era in humanity.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Marc’s pre-war evocation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">vita nuova</span>, terrifyingly latent as Yeats’s rough beast, suddenly acquired the capacity to impose actual tasks. Capturing the Bolshevik mood of Moscow in 1920 was the “Realistic Manifesto” of Naum Gabo and Anton Pevsner (shortly to decamp for the West): “The blossoming of a new culture and a new civilization,” they wrote, “have made us face the fact of new forms of life, already born and active.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even in London a comparable spirit could be felt. “We are the beginning of a new epoch,” Wyndham Lewis proclaimed in his journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tyro</span>, “fresh to it, the first babes of a new, and certainly a better, day.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

			  The <span style="font-style:italic;">new life</span> was now unambiguously political. No longer confined to bohemian coteries or utopian communities, the whole fabric of human relations began to approximate the blank slate evoked by Malevich’s audacious claim, “I transformed myself in the zero of form and emerged from nothing to creation, that is to Suprematism, to the new realism in painting—to non-objective creation.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Realism for Malevich in 1915 meant embracing the new spirit with material resolve. “Our world of art has become new, non-objective, pure,” Malevich announced. “Objects have vanished like smoke, for the sake of the new culture of art.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> The confining reference to a new culture of art dates his proclamation as pre-Revolution (afterward, El Lissitzky could boldly declare: ”Now that we have mastered the plan and system of Suprematism, we will compose a new body for the earth, we will parade it all in such fashion that the sun itself will not recognize its travelling companion”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a>). But the sense of imminent consequence—the war as germination of a new order—was widespread. In Hungary, Lajos Kassák reflected: “It is as if the year 1914 had marked the onset of a new period in the evolution of humankind. The coming of a more human Human Being, inaugurating the age of a new moral order” (BW, 150). Five years later he adopted a no-nonsense imperative: “we need to build a new human being for a new society” (BW, 220). While such claims harbor the ominous prospect of applied social Darwinism, with the state as engineer of souls, in the avant-garde milieu of the 1920s they served primarily as a collectivizing aspiration for new art to serve as cleansing agent for a renewal of human potential.

			  When the cubo-futurists of Moscow declared themselves in 1913 to be “the new people of a new life,” they could hardly have foreseen how prescient their stance was. By 1918 Alexander Blok, by no means a futurist, could be moved by the Revolution to insist, “<span style="font-style:italic;">in the turmoil of the spiritual, political and social revolutions which have their causes in the cosmos, there takes place a transformation—the birth of the new man.</span>”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Bruno Jasienski, addressing his fellow Poles in “A Manifesto Concerning the Immediate Futurization of Life,” declared “We the Futurists are the first to extend our hands in a gesture of fraternity to the ‘new people’” (BW, 190). Ljubomir Micic urged a similar mission in Zagreb: “we want to emerge from ourselves with a New Man and shine a new light into the darkness of the black old days.” Compressed into a litany of exclamations: “New Man! New Spirit! New Art!” (BW, 293, 295). Prague theorists, eager to propagate their slogan, rendered the new man typographically emphatic: “The project of a new world can only be worked out by NEW MAN” (BW, 365). As Hungarian exile Endre Gáspár attested in <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span>, “Like their counterparts elsewhere, the Hungarians wanted to find a New Form for the New Human Being” (BW, 449). Ernó Kállai, also in exile in Berlin, regarded the “new man” as “no mere solitary rehead,” but “a manifold type differentiated into a thousand variants answering to the multitude of practical walks of life” (BW, 613).

			  While the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">LEF</span> exhorted Soviet artists to “Give the world new colors and outlines!” <a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> and Jindrich Styrsky urged painting to be the “living advertisement and project of a new world and life” (BW, 364), fellow Prague theorist Karel Teige demanded the complete fusion of art with action, being with meaning: “BE A POSTER! advertise and project a new world.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  As the cyborgian connotations of such rhetoric suggests, the new consciousness was predicated on prosthetic extensions of the sensory manifold. The generality expressed by Mondrian in 1917—“If art is to be a <span style="font-style:italic;">living reality</span> for modern man, it has to be a pure expression of the new consciousness of the age”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a>—was more avidly correlated with new media by others. Walter Benjamin thought that from film “there truly arises <span style="font-style:italic;">a new region of consciousness</span>”—a view shared by Spanish critic Ledesma Ramos, who proposed that cinema, being “the most inspired contribution to the new style of vitality,” stirred up new prospects for all the arts.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Guillermo de Torre concluded his 1925 study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Literaturas Europeas de Vanguardia</span>, with a paean to the cinematic infusion of avant-garde art in general, inspiring “new rhythms and a new expressive language” he called “lirico-fotogénico.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> These rhythms were the subject of cinematic investigations by Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter, who regarded film as “the new sphere of operation for creative artists” in general.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Eggeling’s designs for <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagonal Symphony</span>, widely featured in vanguard periodicals, served as visual icons of the new sensibility even for those who’d not seen the film. Richter’s article included some of these film cells, and this same issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">De Stijl</span> included essays by Aldo Camini and I. K. Bonset (both pseudonyms of Theo van Doesburg). Bonset’s theory of “nieuve versebeelding” was illustrated with his own letter-sound-constructions and similar works by Kurt Schwitters. Bonset’s Letterklankbeelden resembles a nascent Ursprache reinscribed as blueprint for the future.

			  These models confirm the orientation of Alexander Rodchenko, who said his unusual photographic angles were meant “to accustom people to seeing from new viewpoints.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Moholy-Nagy agreed that photography could be “one of the most important factors in the dawn of a new life.” His own career was a ceaseless elaboration of this fundamental observation: “The development of new technical means has resulted in the emergence of new fields of creativity.”<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Jan Tschichold, whose pioneering synthesis <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Typography</span>  had been instigated by meeting Moholy-Nagy and Lissitzky, was emphatic about his adjective: “Today the old and decadent, the young and vital, confront one another.

			  To apprehend the new world, and make fruitful use of new media, the new man would necessarily undergo an aesthetic education so as to develop a new sensibility.

			  of the perceptual apparatus had been widely theorized during the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> in sociological and medical terms, particularly in diagnoses of neurasthenia. “Our nerves are more sensitive to converging life forms,” Béla Balázs wrote as late as 1912. “This is the same new sensitivity that gave rise to Bergson’s philosophy” (BW, 151–152)—not to mention Simmel’s sociology, and even Freud’s psychoanalysis. Balázs would eventually embrace the cinema as “a new discovery, a new machine” that would “turn the attention of men back to a visual culture and give them new faces”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a>—while Mina Loy proposed such a program in her 1919 pamphlet <span style="font-style:italic;">Auto-Facial Construction</span>. Peculiar as they seem, these propositions by Balázs and Loy had a precedent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> supposition that the latest transport craze could brand users with “bicycle face.”<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> The futurist embrace of the dynamic metropolis made frequent reference to the need for physiological adaptation, and after the war Marinetti would extend this to tactilism— as did Viking Eggeling and Raoul Hausmann in their “Presentist Declaration”: “Now, it is for optics, haptics, etc., to take over, moving along new paths” (BW, 477). What had hitherto been consigned to the amorphous category of artistic genius was now given precise work to do in recently developed technologies. “Every piece of creative work actively observes new laws that expand the human organism’s functional scope” (BW, 478). The editors of the Rumanian journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Integral</span> enthused: “New psychophysiologies are growing” (BW, 554). André Breton, always in search of miracles but hesitant to associate the miraculous with modernity, conceded that radio transmission was “one of the very few specifically new determinations of our minds.”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> And out of these “determinations” emerged a new tempo. “A new rhythm is taking possession of the world, a new movement,” observed architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1923.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> “The art of today,” Henryk Berlewi reminded readers in 1924, “ought to offer a new language  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of forms, accessible to all, that would not lapse into conflict with the rhythm of our present day.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In 1925, pondering William Carlos Williams’s ability to “make a poem of a bare fact—just show you something he noticed,” Mina Loy emphasized: “That is the new rhythm,” the rhythm of the percipient glance.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Williams himself enthused about Marianne Moore, “This is new! The quality is not new, but the freedom is new, the unbridled leap.”<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In the uninhibited exclamation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Spring and All</span> : “THE WORLD IS NEW.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  In its generality, Williams’s enthusiasm elides the specification of commitments widespread in Europe. Polish futurist Anatol Stern, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Almanac of New Art</span> in 1921, encouraged the artistic pursuit of “sensations previously reserved for practical application.”<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> This “kinetic aesthetics” was indebted to the industrial art of film: “In the history of poetry the demarcation line is defined by the technological revolution, the history of the new poetry begins almost simultaneously with the history of film.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Cracow poet Julian Przybos thought that “The new poetry, modeling itself on the laws and methods of labor today, creates new forms of aesthetic production and striving”; and as he urged his peers, “The era of reinforced concrete is holding out its hands for your poems.”<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> It was a point of contention whether the poet needed to depict new technologies, or internalize them as structural principles. Vicente Huidobro thought that “If I sing about an airplane, with the aesthetics of Victor Hugo, I will sound as stale as he, and if I sing of love using a new aesthetic, I will sound and, indeed, be new.”<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> “New conditions of life germinate new forms of spiritual articulation,” wrote Hart Crane. “But to fool one’s self that definitions are being reached by merely referring frequently to skyscrapers, radio antennae, steam whistles, or other surface phenomena of our time is merely to paint a photograph.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> César Vallejo’s 1926 statement, “Poesia Nueva,” conceded the necessity of integrating new vocabulary, but added to the equation the prospect of new metaphors so as to circumvent mere “pedantería de novedad.”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> Metaphor would therefore be the privileged agent, revealing the simultaneous apparition of the new and the archaic. Celebrating the sculpture of Archipenko in 1921, Yvan Goll acclaimed “New Divinities! Is not the telegraph pole or the turbine the equivalent of the Tree of the Pantheists or the Bull of the Assyrians?”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> “Was it the new means of expression that determined the new aesthetic values?” asked Vinicio Paladini in a version of the chicken and egg enigma. “Or was the need to manifest such new aesthetic values—values that took shape in us through social, ethical, critical, or some other sort of influences—responsible for the discovery of those new means?”<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> There was a tendency to extend the concept of the beautiful to both prospects: to new means and to new subjects. Despite their shock tactics, the futurists had been willing to speak of a “new beauty” (FM, 154), and the claim persisted even in Constructivism: “The new beauty was born from constructive work, the basis of modern life,” wrote Karel Teige,<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> who like his colleague Jaroslav Seifert heralded “a new era. New beauty, new poetry of a new life, to which the art of the past has nothing to say” (BW, 383). “A new notion of beauty is born,” Henryk Stazewski exclaimed, “<span style="font-style:italic;">the beauty of utilitarianism</span>” (BW, 492); and, in the same issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blok</span>, Wladislaw Strzeminski defined the constructivist as one who “cleanses the technology of the remnants of traditional aesthetics and reveals the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> beauty of utilitarian objects—a new, universal type of beauty” (BW, 493). Extolling the virtues of modern art for merchandising strategies, Frederick Kiesler cautioned that “the new beauty must be based on EFFICIENCY and not on decorative cosmetics.”<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> Succinctly put by theatre director Meyerhold: “Today’s aesthetic must take account of the new standards which have been created by new social conditions.”<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> This was precisely the point made by Mayakovsky in 1913, whose futurist proclamation “We come with a new word in all fields of art” was tendered with this practical reminder: “nowadays the new can be not some object that is still unknown to everyone in our grey-haired world but a change in looking at relationships between objects that long ago altered their appearance under the influence of the great and really new life of the city.”<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> As Mondrian later pointed out, “the Place de l’Opéra in Paris gives a better image of the new life than many theories. Its rhythm of opposition, twice repeated in two directions, realizes a living equilibrium through the exactness of its execution.”<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  The new aesthetic could be taken as a fulcrum, reassigning to everyday life all the values (spiritual, sensory, cultural) previously affiliated with art. In the fourth thesis of the first De Stijl manifesto, “The new consciousness is ready to be realized in everything, including the everyday things of life.”<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a> Such an aspiration was shared among divergent constituencies of constructivism. Stephan Roll, whose father ran the café Enache Dinu in Bucharest—home to the Rumanian avant-garde—conceived a new model, “poet-<span style="font-style:italic;">sportsman.</span>”<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a> In Prague, Teige expanded on the principle: “If the new art, and that which we shall call <span style="font-style:italic;">poetism</span>, is an art of life, <span style="font-style:italic;">an art of living and enjoying</span>, it must become, eventually, a natural part of everyday life, as delightful and accessible as sport, love, wine, and all manner of other delectations.”<a name="f85-text" href="#f85"><sup>85</sup></a> In the same spirit, Theo van Doesburg and Cornelis van Eesteren asserted, in <span style="font-style:italic;">De Stijl</span>, “Today we can speak only of the constructors of the new life.”<a name="f86-text" href="#f86"><sup>86</sup></a> Looking back from the historical precipice of 1938, <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm</span> editor Herwarth Walden recognized that the postwar ethos was founded on the more generalized surge of prewar euphoria: “Why did the new art cause such a sensation before the world war? Because it <span style="font-style:italic;">stirred</span> the senses. Not because it created new forms, but because it expressed the new form of life” (GE, 321).
			</p>
<p>
			  A new hedonism was associated with novel forms of entertainment, like jazz (“evidence of a new vitality in music, a struggle after a form of expression, crude as the hieroglyphic of Cubism, but genuine art, nevertheless”<a name="f87-text" href="#f87"><sup>87</sup></a>); but at the same time the economic and political instability, along with the awesome transformation of Czarist Russia to the USSR, made statecraft conceptually proximate to craft in the artistic sense. What had been merely a descriptive or evocative term—as in Marc’s “The New Painting” in 1912 or Apollinaire’s “The New Spirit and the Poets” in 1917—became charged with potentiality. “We are launching a new art in a free and new country,” the Bucharest vanguard journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Punct</span> declared in the wake of the new Rumanian democratic constitution.<a name="f88-text" href="#f88"><sup>88</sup></a> Yvan Goll auspiciously greeted the dawn of the new era in 1918 with his book of poems <span style="font-style:italic;">Der neue Orpheus</span> (and, with the poems rewritten in French, not merely translated: <span style="font-style:italic;">Le nouvel Orphée</span> in 1923). Like Goll and other proponents of the avant-garde, Moholy-Nagy made a specialty of engaging the new point by point: “On the Problem of New Content and New Form” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Akasztott Ember,</span> 1922), “The New  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Typography” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar,</span> 1923), “New Form in Music: Potentialities of the Phonograph” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Der Sturm,</span> 1923). His Bauhaus book, which had appeared in German under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Von Material zu Architektur</span> in 1929, was published in English as <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Vision</span> in 1932, and he continued to extol the new throughout the decade: “A New Instrument of Vision” and “New Film Experiments” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Korunk,</span> 1933), “A New Instrument of Vision” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Telehor,</span> 1936), and “Light: A New Medium of Expression” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Architectural Forum,</span> 1939).

			  During the 1920s, the period known in Germany for the new objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit), the new adorned countless book titles: from Bruno Taut’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Dwelling</span>  and Huntly Carter’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Theatre and Cinema of Soviet Russia</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit in the European Theatre, 1914–1924</span> , to Alain Locke’s anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Negro</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">New Mouth</span> by Tadeusz Peiper , <span style="font-style:italic;">Neue Gestaltung</span> by Mondrian , Le Corbusier’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards a New Architecture</span> (1927—the “new” being added for the English edition), Adolf Behne’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Dwelling—New Building</span> , Jan Tschichold’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Typography</span> , Werner Gräff’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Here Comes the New Photographer!</span>  and Huntly Carter, again, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit in the Russian Theatre 1917–1928</span> . Nor were such titles confined to the arts. Claude Bragdon in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Image</span>  extolled the virtues of androgyny; and his publisher found the time ripe to reprint Havelock Ellis’s 1890 book <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spirit</span> . Late in the day for its topic, it would seem, G. E. Newsom pondered even <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Morality</span> , a subject Pound had memorably visited long before in “The Encounter” (“All the while they were talking the new morality / Her eyes explored me”<a name="f89-text" href="#f89"><sup>89</sup></a>). Notably, and not surprisingly given the climate, “new” as a catchword acquired a distinctive political efficacy in the 1930s. In a sadly optimistic gesture, the surrealist enclave in Teneriffe issued a manifesto in 1933, identifying “the new spirit” with the international outlook that would soon meet its real adversaries in the Spanish Civil War. The progressivist <span style="font-style:italic;">new</span> made an earlier debut before the Great War, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Democracy</span> by Walter Weyl , one of the founders of <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span> in 1914; President Woodrow Wilson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Freedom</span> in 1913; and playwright Percy MacKaye’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Citizenship: A Civic Ritual</span> performed in City College of New York Stadium on Independence Day, 1916. Walther Rathenau laid the groundwork for <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Society</span> in Germany , and Gabriel García Maroto anticipated <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Spain 1930</span> . The decade of Roosevelt’s “New Deal” was populated by <span style="font-style:italic;">New Minds, New Men? The Emergence of the Soviet Citizen</span> by Thomas Woody , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Germany Desires Work and Peace</span> by newly appointed German Chancellor Adolf Hitler , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Capitalism</span> by James D. Mooney , <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Democracy</span> by Harold Ickes , H. G. Wells’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New American, The New World</span> , Walter Lippmann’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Imperative</span> , and—showing the final stress points of international diplomacy—<span style="font-style:italic;">The New Propaganda</span> by Amber Blanco White  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New German Empire</span> by Franz Borkenau . Riding the rhetorical tide, Hitler gave an ominous twist in his 1937 speech opening the House of German Art (printed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Degenerate Art</span> exhibition catalogue). “Today the new age is shaping a new human type.” This type was on canonical display at the previous year’s Olympic games, declared the Führer, reproaching modern  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> artists <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>: “this human type, you gentlemen of the prehistoric, spluttering art brigade, is the type of the new age.”<a name="f90-text" href="#f90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  Despite cynical political appropriations, the decade of Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New</span>  did not go without further hopes for artistic renewal. Henry Cowell’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Musical Resources</span>  and Léon Moussinac’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Movement in the Theatre</span>  tended the flame, as did <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Architecture and the Bauhaus</span> by Walter Gropius  and, as late as 1939, Andreas Feininger’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Paths in Photography</span>. Composer Ernst Krenek scrutinized “New Humanity and Old Objectivity” for <span style="font-style:italic;">Neue Schweizer Rundschau</span> , Fernand Léger lectured at the Museum of Modern Art on “The New Realism” (published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Art Front</span>, 1935—and, in the same venue, “The New Realism Goes On” in 1937), Herbert Read proposed “A New Humanism” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Architectural Review,</span> 1935), and Carola Giedion-Welcker celebrated “New Roads in Modern Sculpture” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Transition,</span> 1935). In addition, there were informative compilations: <span style="font-style:italic;">The European Caravan: An Anthology of the New Spirit in European Literature</span> edited by Samuel Putnam and others  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Caravan</span> assembled by the sterling team of Alfred Kreymborg, Lewis Mumford and Paul Rosenfeld . Finally, instigated by Pound, James Laughlin inaugurated the annual <span style="font-style:italic;">New Directions in Prose and Poetry</span> (beginning in 1936 and lasting for fifty years) and, under the New Directions imprint, a decisive instigation in literary criticism was launched with several publications by Yvor Winters, given the inevitable moniker <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Criticism</span> by John Crowe Ransom in 1941.
			</p>
<p>
			  By the time Laughlin founded New Directions, ironically, it was getting a bit late to proclaim the new with the old confidence. There would always be <span style="font-style:italic;">news</span>, of course, bearing creative difference and deflection in its wake. Soon New York would be filling up with refugees, fertilizing avatars of surrealism and abstraction, opposing visions that in the American crucible ignited one of the more successful artistic phenomena of the twentieth century with abstract expressionism. In Europe, the choral momentum for making it new had served to advertise shared aspirations among members of the avant-garde, lending a strikingly cohesive aspect to manifesto rhetoric during the Twenties, reflecting either allegiance to communism or respect for the constructivist outlook broadcast from Russia. While there was considerable support among American artists for the Soviet cause, few of them could sustain expectations for a comparable revolution in the United States. Still, the American communist journal became <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Masses</span>, no longer the old huddled and yearning masses. After John Dos Passos and John Howard Lawson formed a group called New Playwrights, Lawson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Processional</span>  became a widely reviewed and successful pro-Marxist production, while Dos Passos’ growing skepticism about Communism was chronicled in <span style="font-style:italic;">U. S. A.</span> (1930– 1936). Possibly the socialist implications of the adjective in The New Deal were more worrisome to Roosevelt’s foes than the legislation itself. But “new” was a relatively neutral term, unlikely to absorb exclusively partisan implications (unlike, say, “red” during the HUAC hearings after World War II). In fact, the advertising slogan “new and improved” carried no such taint; and this provides another clue to the ascendancy of the new between the wars.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
			  As one of the headlines in Dos Passos’s “Newsreel” portfolios in <span style="font-style:italic;">U. S. A.</span> succinctly reports, “NEW METHODS OF SELLING SEEN.”<a name="f91-text" href="#f91"><sup>91</sup></a> American advertising culture underwent a dramatic shift in tactics, pitching the dream, the phantasm, rather than a wordy checklist of product credentials. “Advertising men were modernity’s ‘town criers’,” in Roland Marchand’s characterization. “Perceiving new vacuums of guidance and personal relationships,” the ad men “stepped forward to offer their products as answers to modern discontents. Thus what made advertising ‘modern’ was, ironically, the discovery by these ‘apostles of modernity’ of techniques for empathizing with the public’s imperfect acceptance of modernity.”<a name="f92-text" href="#f92"><sup>92</sup></a> By 1926 trade reviewers of the Art Directors’ Annual Exhibition of Advertising Art recognized the signature ad style of the day as indebted to modernism, including the use of diagonals, off-center graphic layout, unresolved pictorial tensions, and expressive distortion. Tactics refined at the Bauhaus and long since pervasive in Soviet design were being embraced by American advertising executives like Helen Woodward who, in <span style="font-style:italic;">It’s An Art</span>, hailed modernist design for its ability to “suggest novelty without the use of words.”<a name="f93-text" href="#f93"><sup>93</sup></a> The Museum of Modern Art went so far as to employ liaison personnel to help advertisers identify potential applications of its resources.
			</p>
<p>
			  A singularly informed, if little known, contribution to the merger of art and commerce was Frederick Kiesler’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and its Display</span> , with its distinctive dedication not to an individual but to the goal of “a sound cooperation between public, artist and industry.” In the prologue, Kiesler itemizes his reasons for writing the book:
			</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			    because the country has been flooded with examples of poor and distorted modernism because the sudden influence of contemporary art makes it necessary to control its real value
			  </p>
<p>
			    because the new beauty must be based on EFFICIENCY and not on decorative cosmetics<a name="f94-text" href="#f94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  Acknowledging that contemporary art had been thoroughly dismaying to the American public, Kiesler had the insight that it was precisely through commercial venues that modern art, as <span style="font-style:italic;">packaging and design</span>, would eventually infiltrate the American psyche.
			</p>
<p>
			  According to an industry observer, “Modernism offered the opportunity of expressing the inexpressible, of suggesting not so much a motor car as speed, not so much a gown as style, not so much a compact as beauty.”<a name="f95-text" href="#f95"><sup>95</sup></a> In this respect, the vanguard encomiums to the new society, the new world, and so forth were comparable pledges of faith in unsubstantiated desires. When Le Corbusier juxtaposed the image of an automobile with the Parthenon in <span style="font-style:italic;">L’Esprit nouveau</span>, the commercial potential of modernism was confirmed. The resuscitation of the cult of Nike, however, pinpoints the modernist commitment to <span style="font-style:italic;">make it new</span> as an Achilles heel—or so it has seemed to many commentators who deplore the absorption of modernist tendencies in art by commercial culture. There is ground for alarm, of course, when one contemplates characteristic constructivist designs becoming decorative motifs for crass products of late twentieth-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> capitalism; but the real thing, the original initiative, couldn’t survive even under communism. So the persistence of these flickering design logos from the aftermath of the October Revolution have attained a utopian afterlife, signifying <span style="font-style:italic;">the good life</span> for those with sufficient educational background to know what <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> good life was (or might have been) all about. It’s also worth recalling that the most securely canonized of modernist authors made his modern Ulysses an ad man. And what could be more <span style="font-style:italic;">a propos</span> than Leopold Bloom’s encounter with the Cyclops (a.k.a. Citizen) in a Dublin pub: “Because you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That’s the whole secret.”<a name="f96-text" href="#f96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  By the end of the Thirties, the rhetoric of the new in artistic circles had acquired a paradoxically dated aura, much the way the term “modern” had lost its edge a century after Baudelaire’s worried appraisal of an art with one foot in eternity and the other in the gutter. Baudelaire’s unique contribution to the emergence of modernism as new, as <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span>, endorsed improbable alliances between novelty and durability, dignity and buffoonery, triviality and wisdom. It was a course that prompted Hugo Ball to consider, in the midst of the great flourish of Cabaret Voltaire in 1916, “There is a danger that only our mistakes are new.”<a name="f97-text" href="#f97"><sup>97</sup></a> That Jean Epstein could put a positive spin on it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonjour Cinema</span> in 1921—“We are different . . . we need to make new mistakes”<a name="f98-text" href="#f98"><sup>98</sup></a>—only heightens the sting. Make it new, then, could also mean make new mistakes. And, with another twist by way of Victor Shklovsky, making it new could also mean: make it strange. Hugo Ball surmised as much, writing in his diary, in a passage that modestly yet immoderately sums up its era: “The distancing device is the staff of life. Let us be thoroughly new and inventive. Let us rewrite life every day.”<a name="f99-text" href="#f99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>
			  Pound’s slogan has had such preponderant influence—his imperative is hard to resist, after all—that it can hardly be consigned to the historical past. Its insistence presses forward, inexorably. So it’s fitting that a <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> response from the choir unabashedly proclaimed, in the master’s voice, “the new sentence.”<a name="f100-text" href="#f100"><sup>100</sup></a> The advocate was Ron Silliman, self-elected custodian in the Poundian lineage; and his promotion of a compositional strategy he provided models for in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ketjak</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tjanting—</span>accompanied by what’s been the more widely embraced <span style="font-style:italic;">My Life</span> by Lyn Hejinian—played a decisive role in establishing “language poetry” as a singular phenomenon in the waning galaxy of the avant-garde at century’s end. As terms like <span style="font-style:italic;">modern</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">postmodern</span> cracked skulls in the empire of Godot, the real locomotion continued to be powered by the simplest and most irresistible of adjectives.

				Ezra Pound, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cantos</span> (New York: New Directions, 1972), 265. Kurt Heinzelman emphasizes the role of cultural transmission—always important to Pound—in the patrimony of the phrase: “Pound’s phrase MAKE IT NEW is not merely a mistranslation but a kind of cultural sounding: it is a translation (from French) of a translation (from Manchuan or Mongolian Chinese) of a translation (from twelfth-century neo-Confucian Chinese) of a text of greater antiquity than the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible. So, what is ‘new’ has here passed through four excavations, traversing nearly four  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> millennia.” As Heinzelman adds, “the apotheosis of translation into the vehicle for disclosing what remains new about antiquity is one of Pound’s most luminous claims” (“‘Make It New’: The Rise of an Idea,” in Kurt Heinzelman, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">Make It New: The Rise of Modernism</span> [Austin, TX: Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, 2003], 132).
