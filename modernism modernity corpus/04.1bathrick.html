The story of the "Wunschkonzert" in Nazi Germany is at the same time
the history of one of the most successful propaganda projects to take
place in the Third Reich. "Wunschkonzert," literally "Wish-Concert" but
translated more faithfully as "concert by request," was originally the
name of an extremely popular radio program in which listeners could send
in bids for their favorite songs and have them played by a live orchestra
before what was truly a national audience. It was also the name of a
1940 Nazi film <I>about </I>that radio program which itself has been
described as one of the biggest German box office hits of the wartime.

<P>
My task will be to tell those two stories, one about the radio program,
the other about the film, as a way of talking about the role of the
entertainment industry as a disseminator of Nazi propaganda during the
twelve-year period between 1933 and 1945. Works about propaganda in the
Third Reich often barely even mention the role of the "Wunschkonzert."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 When one thinks of mass media in the service of the Nazi Party, what most
 likely comes to mind are films such as Leni Riefenstahl's <I>Triumph
 of the Will </I>about the 1934 Nazi party rally at Nuremberg or her
 extraordinary documentary film about the 1936 Olympics. Or one might
 think of the scurrilous anti-Semitic films like <I>Jud S&uuml;ss </I>or
 <I>The Eternal Jew, </I>which were made and distributed in preparation
 for the final solution beginning in 1941. Or, most insistently, one
 is reminded of the shrill, piercing radio voice of the F&uuml;hrer
 himself, intoning his messages of hate over airwaves controlled by the
 one-party system.



<B></B>

<P>
But these were not the only means that the Party employed for garnering
support and political legitimation. Nor were they the most successful
ones. Of increasing importance was the use of light entertainment in
an attempt to bind together the <I>Volksgemeinschaft, </I>the community
of the <I>Volk </I>or the people as they called it, into one big happy
family. The early years of Nazi rule saw the official media featuring the
spectacle of marching troops, torch parades, political speeches to the
masses, and brown shirt films directed toward organizing disenchanted male
youth into the party. However, it soon became clear to Joseph Goebbels
and his entire ministry that the <I>Volk </I>was simply fed up with all
this "politics." The answer, they decided, was to make the invocation of
their political message a less obvious and overbearing one, to present
their political positions in the wrappings of culture.

<P>
Certainly the radio would play a very special role in the new
communication system. In the development of larger goals, radio
programs were seen as having to transcend the pluralism and excessive
intellectuality of the Weimar Republic in order to strive for a
<I>Volkbildung </I>(the formation rather than simply the education of
a people) in a larger sense: now they spoke of forming a new folk soul
of "true and genuine life"; of a "deeper" sense of values than are
communicated in the belief systems of bourgeois democracies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 This "metaphysics of the radio," as it was called, suggested almost
 a religious calling, and was literally defined as such in a leading
 media journal: "The art of the radio <I>[Rundfunkkunst] </I>seeks to
 leave the marketplace and return to the church, to a church, which will
 encompass all its listeners with the same atmospheric powers and which
 is capable of bridging distances just like the all uniting House of
 the Lord. Here the central actors are no longer individual destinies,
 but rather ideas, they are community creating powers which speak forth
 with one voice in a manner that moves the many."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
One of the most successful renditions of this "art of the radio," was
the "Wunschkonzert," which has been described as the "miracle working
invention" of Heinz Goedecke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The program had its debut in January of 1936, and the format as
 originally planned was to have five different orchestras playing over
 a four hour period from eight until midnight on the Deutschlandsender.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 All a listener had to do to participate was to send a request for a
 particular song accompanied by a donation for the <I>Winterhilfswerk
 </I>(social welfare for the poor). With that they would be able to hear
 their selection along with a dedication. As it turned out, the initial
 responses went considerably beyond expectations and by March of 1936
 the program was expanded to six hours of programming.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In short, it was a spectacular success, with the result that by the
 end of the fourteenth broadcast shortly before the outbreak of World
 War II, the government had earned well over a quarter of a million marks.

<P>
On 1 October 1939, the organizers premiered a new version of the program
called the "Wunschkonzert f&uuml;r die Wehrmacht" (Wunschkonzert for
the armed forces), which continued the format of calling for donations,
but also made as their central focus the soldiers on the front. The new
format stipulated that soldiers and families of soldiers were the only
ones permitted to participate and that for the remainder of



<B></B>



1939, at least, it was to be broadcast twice a week every Wednesday
and Sunday afternoon from 5:00 to 8:00 before a live audience in a
concert hall.

<P>
And what were the ideological implications of this program? Key for
the creating of a genuine <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>were the musical
selections themselves. Where earlier attempts to use the radio for
cultural legitimation had featured <I>excessive </I>amounts of high
culture--one Beethoven cycle within a twelve day period sent out over
all stations included a performance of <I>Fidelio </I>and the nine
symphonies--the musical offerings of the "Wunschkonzert" contained a
potpourri of material taken from all over the cultural map.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Music from operas and operettas, folk songs, march music, overtures, love
 ballads, children's lullabies, military t tunes, jazz and pop songs,
 were interspersed with classical music and short oral presentations or
 the recitation of poems, etc. The program began with a bugle fanfare
 and Hitler's favorite march, the <I>Badenweiler, </I>and ended with
 a listing of the day's contributors. In between there were musical
 performances by some of the leading artists of the day as well as by
 amateurs who had never performed publicly.

<P>
The regime's emphasis on "light entertainment music" was part of a
growing recognition on the part of Goebbels and the propaganda ministry
concerning the importance of cultural offerings appearing to "interest
the common taste and being understandable and pleasing to the less
sophisticated listener."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, in his dealings with the "Wunschkonzert" itself, Goebbels
 was known to have intervened on numerous occasions in efforts to raise
 the level of its quality by having well known artists take part in
 its programs. Moreover, the increasing pre-censorship of the programs
 on the part of the propaganda ministry often had as much to do with
 the selection of particular pieces and artists as it did with what was
 explicitly said politically in any of the broadcasts. Werner Krauss, Hans
 Albers, Willi Birgel, Zarah Leander, Gustav Gr&uuml;ndgens, Katharina
 S&ouml;derbaum, Jenny Jugo, Hans S&ouml;hnker, Grethe Weiser, Paul
 H&ouml;rbiger, Willy Fritsch, Heinz R&uuml;hmann, and Marika R&ouml;kk
 were just a few of the stars from the world of screen who were coddled
 and in some cases intimidated into making unpaid appearances on the
 program.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
The point, finally, of the "Wunschkonzert" was precisely not to challenge
the audience intellectually, culturally, or above all politically, but
rather to provide in this combination of folksy humor and familiar musical
oldies a mix of high and low culture which would bring together war front
and home front, old and young, children and parents, working people
and the educated bourgeoisie; bring them together into a <I>feel-good
</I>version of the Reich as national family. It was also designed to make
the <I>Volk </I>itself feel actively and vitally involved. If standardized
political propaganda had come to feature the F&uuml;hrer as the vanguard
re haranguing and imploring the masses to ever greater heights of
political and now military commitment to the Fatherland, the coziness
of the "Wunschkonzert" sent a very different message. Here there was
no mention of Blood and Soil, the Aryan master race, or the beauty of
labor; no overbearing use of Nazi iconography or the F&uuml;hrer re
with arm in outstretched salute; no sounds of the Horst Wessel song or
frenzied singing of "Deutschland,



<B></B>



 Deutschland &uuml;ber alles." On the contrary, the mood was one of
 sentimentality, domesticity, and <I>Gem&uuml;tlichkeit</I>--all of which
 was meant to replace the latent violence and heroicized sensation of the
 Nazi public sphere so familiar to us from the cinematic performances
 of Fascist power in the Riefenstahl film. To be sure, there was still
 the military march music, yet it was situated now as but one dimension
 of an expanded horizon in which public and private were conjoined in
 domestic harmony; and in which the aggression of war was transformed--not
 forgotten, certainly not repressed--into the solidity of a deeper kind
 of <I>Volksgemeinschaft. </I>

<P>
This integration of family, state, and war in the "Wunschkonzert" was
particularly important, for it demonstrated how the power of the radio
as a tool of Nazi manipulation lay precisely in its ability to break
down the demarcations of private and public, individual and community,
which was so central an element of the fascist grasp of power. This was
surely one of the reasons why the "Wunschkonzert" was said to have become
the symbol for the entire radio project centering on the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 At the level of the military and war itself, the program was often
 advertised as a direct means of communication, not only between soldiers
 and their families, but also between soldiers and units which had
 become separated from each other. One of the most celebrated incidents
 in this regard was the role it played in paying homage to the captain
 and crew of the U-boat that had carried out a bold attack on the British
 fleet anchored at Scapa Flow in October of 1939. Uncertain as to their
 successes, the bearded men on the returning victorious U-boot turned on
 their radio to the "Wunschkonzert" only to learn that they had indeed
 sunk the mighty battleships <I>The Royal Oak </I>and <I>The Repulse
 </I>and that they had been awarded fifty thousand marks from donations
 to the "Wunschkonzert" for their efforts. In awe of the powers of the
 radio, the victorious Captain G&uuml;nther Prien was quoted as saying:
 "Now here someone has pulled off something that is a thousand times
 better than anything we have achieved."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
On a broader comparative level, it should also be mentioned in conclusion
that the paradigm shift occurring within the Nazi public sphere
parallelled as much as it clearly differed from public life in other
advanced industrial societies. As in the United States, 1930s Germany
saw the extensive growth of a culture industry in which mass mediated
techniques of advertising and the commodification of politics changed
the very framework of contemporary social and political life. The move
from a primitive notion of <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>grounded in concepts
of Teutonic ritual and a return to pre-industrial forms of <I>Heimat
</I>(home) and community gave way now to an embracing of more modern
forms of representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The building of up-to-date communication systems like the autobahn,
 sound film, television, and air travel, as well as the development of
 vast consumer and war industries, brought a profound transformation
 of cultural forms and of visual and auditory acuity. Where the Nazis
 originally had sustained, at least ideologically, an anti-modern stance
 toward urban culture and contemporary life, they now increasingly sought
 to affirm the potential of technology and modernization precisely as a
 way to enable the values of a national community that would <I>overcome
 </I>the alienation of bourgeois democratic societies.



<B></B>

<P>
Certainly the message of a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>born out of the
power of technology and the potential of the newest media was also
central to the film <I>Wunschkonzert </I>made by Eduard von Borsody in
1940. And like the radio program, which is so central to its plot-line,
this film also participated in a discourse which claimed to overcome the
separations between home front and war front, private and public, by an
assertion of the healing powers of a benevolent, all domesticating Nazi
public sphere. Von Borsody himself underlines this point by stressing
the differences between present conditions in the Third Reich and the
failures of policy during World War I.

<P>

The war front and the home front were no longer able to understand each
other back then, they spoke different languages, the common bond was
broken. . . . Today the home front stands in intimate contact with the
war front. And to that end the radio, and above all the <I>Wunschkonzert
</I>for the Wehrmacht, have made major contributions.

<P>
Billed as a musical comedy about the war, the movie <I>Wunschkonzert
</I>tells of two lovers who are separated by war, but who, because
of everlasting love, faithfulness to duty, and some help by a radio
program, are eventually able to reunite within the reaches of a greater
Reich. The story begins when a young girl named Inge Wagner (Ilse Werner)
meets Herbert Koch (Carl Raddatz), a lieutenant in the air force, at the
1936 Olympic games in Berlin. After three days of glorious courtship
she decides to marry him. This initial section of the film is full of
images <I>&agrave; la </I>Riefenstahl of the spectacular Berlin games
together with tourist guide romancing of the highlights in the capital,
all of which is suddenly interrupted by the call to duty of Herbert to
carry out a secret mission with the Condor Legion in support of Franco
in the Spanish civil war. Because Herbert is not permitted to write
letters home, the two lose contact, although Inge never gives up hope,
of course. Time goes by and shortly before the outbreak of the war, a
young ter pilot named Helmut Winkler (Joachim Brennecke) meets and
falls in love with Inge. However, despite the fact that three years have
past since Koch's departure, Inge maintains her vigil and turns down
Winkler's offer of marriage. Thus it is that the major tension of the
film emerges almost at its very outset, namely the tension between the
male fulfillment of duty by the stoic lieutenant Koch and the power of
emotional feelings represented most forcefully by its eternal guardian,
the faithful female Inge Wagner. It is this juxtaposition--it is not,
importantly, staged as a conflict--between deep seated, indefatigable
desire, on the one hand, and the repeated deferment of its gratification
in the name of national duty, on the other, that impels the story to its
inevitable resolution. Yet while Inge's desire is indeed the demiurge
of the action, it is the "Wunschkonzert" which will finally enable its
happy, but also its politically proper ending.

<P>
However, this film is more than just a love story. Imbedded in its plot
are numerous little subplots dealing with men who go to war and others
who stay at home. One concerns a teacher who is inducted into the armed
forces and must leave behind his pregnant wife, only to learn later in
a broadcast of the "Wunschkonzert" that she has



<B></B>



given birth to a son. The announcement is followed by a children's choir
singing the egregiously sentimental lullaby "Schlaf mein Princhen, Schlaf
ein" (Sleep, my little prince, go to sleep). Another recounts the story of
a young man who is a performer of classical music, particularly Beethoven,
and who having sacrificed his life in order to save his comrades has a
song dedicated to his memory for the "Wunschkonzert." Looking through
his notebook, his mother had discovered his handwritten rendering of the
song "Gute Nacht, Mutter" (Goodnight, Mother), and as the whole nation
listens, it is sung to her now over the Deutschlandsender, posthumously
as it were. Yet another subplot offers the comic tale of the two soldiers
who steal five pigs from the French and come to Berlin in order to present
them live and with a singing of their own horrendously kitschy composition
on national radio. Finally, as our plot summaries suggest, each strand
of the narrative is woven into and through the "Wunschkonzert" which
becomes its ultimate apotheosis and resolution.

<P>
Thus the "Wunschkonzert" as a radio program functions within the film
both as a place of national reconciliation and as an agent or player in
bringing about narrative resolution. As a space of renewal it serves to
bridge the gap between home front and war front, and in so doing, quite
literally to sing the praises of the media and of the benevolent party
which have made it all possible. One of the central themes of Third
Reich propaganda was the ever recurring call for the "acquisition of
more <I>Lebensraum," </I>living space, to compensate for what Hitler
himself felt to be the natural claim of the German race to territorial
expansion and rule.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Moreover, as an imperialist slogan it served to justify the need for the
 kinds of expansion which eventually led to the invasions of Poland, the
 Czech Sudetenland, Austria, the western front, and finally the Soviet
 Union; or even the kinds of fantasies that dreamed of regaining lost
 colonies in Southwest Africa.

<P>
In their use of the radio, the Nazis succeeded in opening up still
another, somewhat broadened sense of <I>Lebensraum, </I>this time via
the airwaves. If we speak today of cyberspace as the broaching of a new
frontier, clearly the consolidation of a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>by means
of networking private and public experience within an expanded frontier
of national space became an important political point of legitimation
and control. Father and mother and newborn babe are brought together
again in ether space, enabled by an apparatus that will link their
individual destinies spatially and communally to the now expanded
familial Reich. Departed son and mourning mother as iconic metaphor
for all the losses in the present and anticipated losses in the future
are united through and in this expanded Reich as a kind of surrogate
religious transcendence.

<P>
Here the cinematic representation of this ethereal Reich is particularly
important. In the birth scene, the shot/reverse-shot editing creates a
relationship between mother and child at home and father at the front,
in which their proximity and intimacy are enhanced by having them stare
directly out of the frame as though beholding each other face to face. The
tilting head of the mother looks up into the father's eyes in a perfect
eyeline match as if she were showing him the baby firsthand. As such,
it serves as a visual expansion of their auditory intimacy, itself bound
together by the



<B></B>



sounds of the saccharine lullaby. A similar intimacy is created in the
final scene between mother and departed son with a camera pan linking
the piano on which he played, a photograph of his face and the mourning
mother--all in full view of the nation at large. In each case, the message
is one in which radio and cinematic media unite under the guidance of
the Party to represent a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>which now has room
for family values and a domesticated public sphere, promising as well
the possibility for active participation in the shaping of the new cause.

<P>
Yet in addition to being a locus for expanded spatial relationships, the
"Wunschkonzert" also provided resolution for the plot. To understand its
ultimate narrative function in the film, let us return to the main love
story. After waiting in vain for word from her fianc&eacute; Herbert, Inge
suddenly hears his name in a broadcast of the "Wunschkonzert." In memory
of their wonderful days at the Olympic Games, Herbert has requested a
playing of the Olympic anthem, whereupon Inge learns of his location and
writes him a letter requesting a rendezvous. This planned meeting also
goes for nought, as Herbert is once more commandeered to the front. In
the meantime, Inge's friend and unrequited suitor Helmut Winkler ends
up under the command of Koch in the same flying unit. At first they are
unaware that they are in love with the same woman, then Koch discovers
Winkler's attachment and renounces his love for Inge, whereupon Inge
finally arrives on the scene and reaffirms her love for Koch. The two
march off into the dusk to the tune of march music and the images of a
massive war assault against England by sea and air.

<P>
The message of the film seems rather an obvious one. Individual love has
been subordinated to the interests of the community. The somewhat pallid,
if nevertheless heroic Herbert Koch must first complete his military
commitments, twice delaying consummation of their love affair as we,
the audience, are taken on death defying flying missions over the enemy
skies of Spain in 1936 and the Atlantic in 1939. Moreover the consummation
itself, when it finally does occur, is virtually state-initiated by the
all encompassing arm of the "Wunschkonzert." Like the other subplots,
the reconciliation must occur under the auspices of a public sphere which
will weld the two together. Thus it is not at all surprising that Inge,
the agent of narrative desire and closure, will come to her major insight
while listening to this radio program--more specifically the beautiful
strains from the overture to Mozart's <I>The Marriage of ro--</I>at
the very end of the film. Love conquers all, as long as it is in league
with the forces of communitarian truth. Communitarian truth in this
instance is the folksy togetherness of the radio program--now writ large.

<P>
Although the focus of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>remains within the generic
framework of a love comedy, muting its references to the icons and
signification of specifically Nazi politics and history, there are a
number of oblique and not so oblique allusions that mark it clearly
within the historical reference points of contemporary political
events. The opening sequences at the Olympic Stadium, for instance,
splice in documentary material from Riefenstahl's film <I>Olympiad
</I>and newsreel footage highlighting the opening of the games. The film
actually begins with a fade in to the Olympic bell and the Olympic rings
with clouds in the background and includes brief cuts to the



<B></B>



F&uuml;hrer as well as opening ceremonial parades into the stadium,
featuring in particular the teams of Japan and Italy with hands raised
in the Hitler salute. While Hitler and the Party are indeed present in
<I>Wunschkonzert, </I>they do not play an overbearing or even prominent
role in the film as a whole. One sees pictures in the background or
swastikas on the margins.

<P>
Koch's involvement in the Spanish Civil War as a member of the Condor
Legion is also treated through vague allusions to a secret mission,
soldiers lined up for inspection before departure, high praise for the
Luftwaffe, brief shots of ter raids, etc. Thus "History" is found
on the edges of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>and in moments of digression from
the main narrative--in documentary footage of the invasion of Poland,
in an isolated battle scene in which the good son who plays Beethoven is
killed saving his comrades, in a bombing raid in which Koch is shot down
and Winkler wounded through anti-aircraft ter flak. History is there,
but it clearly remains subordinated to the larger story of the film.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 While it lends the movie a sense of contemporary events--mobilization,
 calls to duty, heroic commitment to the Fatherland, etc.--what we are
 really getting here is history with a small "h": the history of the
 little people who make war possible and the politics of a government
 which is creating another mode of togetherness and community. It is a
 history of private life which, unlike the alienated separations of the
 older bourgeois order, will be organized into a harmony of the home
 and state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
Yet as much as the message of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>is ultimately a
conventionally "political" one, it is the politics of entertainment
which is really writing the master text and gaining the upper hand. As
Goebbels himself was to point out on numerous occasions:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
At a time in which the entire nation is burdened with such heavy cares,
entertainment is from the perspective of state politics of special
value. . . . A national leadership that wishes to be worthy of such a
name has as its first and foremost duty to stand by its people. In this
regard, the film is one of the most valuable means by which individual
Germans are able to beautify those few non-work hours that they have
left for refreshing their spiritual powers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Goebbels does not use the word escapism here, yet the implication is there
and the developing policy clearly followed along these lines. While the
beginning of the war years brought a repoliticizing of film in its focus
on the subject of war, <I>Wunschkonzert </I>as well as another highly
popular film of 1942 entitled <I>Die gro&szlig;e Liebe </I>(The Great
Love) are classic examples of how the codes of Hollywood love comedies
were used to sweeten the pill. For instance, the genre that comes most
immediately to mind for <I>Wunschkonzert </I>is that of the separation
love story as screwball comedy, represented most obviously in Leo
McCarey's film <I>Love Affair </I>of 1939, starring Charles Boyer and
Irene Dunne, which was remade as <I>An Affair to Remember </I>in 1957
(with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr) and <I>Love Affair </I>(with Warren
Beatty and Annette Bening) in 1994. Looking beneath the thematic surface
of war, Reich, Olympic games, and <I>Volksgemeinschaft, </I>one finds
at a deeper structural



<B></B>



 level a powerful homology between the two films in the narrative rhythms
 generated by the deferred desires of unconsummated love. If lack is the
 driving force that motivates the events and propels the narrative of any
 film, <I>Wunschkonzert </I>and <I>Love Affair </I>display remarkably
 similar patterns in the way that system operates in the denied and
 finally consummated love of the major res.

<P>
In <I>Love Affair, </I>of course, there is nothing remotely political
or even socially relevant put forth as the reason for the separation
and delayed reconciliation of the two lovers. The jaded Michel Marnay
and the younger, but equally skeptical Terry McCay--both about to enter
marriages of convenience with wealthy suitors--meet on an ocean liner
headed for New York City and, after a flurry of cynical banter and
comic repartee, suddenly fall wildly in love. Rather than simply run
off together and get married, however, they decide to put themselves on
probation by separating for six months in order to determine whether they
are worthy of their love. Worthiness, in this context it seems, is being
defined by the protestant work ethic, for during their period of delay,
Michel works as a sign painter and Terry sings in nightclubs. On her way
to the appointed marriage rendezvous, Terry suffers a tragic accident,
ending up in the hospital and leaving poor Michel to wait in vain for
her arrival. Completely in the dark as to why she didn't show up, Michel
assumes he has been left in the lurch and the separation continues--almost
unbearably--until they finally manage to find each other again.

<P>
Without arguing that <I>Wunschkonzert </I>was directly influenced by
<I>Love Affair</I>--I certainly have no evidence that it was--let me
suggest two key dimensions of the Hollywood model as revealed therein
which might be seen to undergo an interesting reinscription in this
German film of the same period. Central to both films is the obvious
theme of separation, deferred gratification, and final restitution. Both
narratives are driven by an insatiate desire to restore to balance and
harmony an initial love idyll that has been torn asunder by unforeseen
events. Yet the differences between the two are also significant. The
American film attributes the failure to consummate first to a whim of fate
(the tragic accident) and then to a not very well motivated stubbornness
of pride on Terry's part in refusing to locate Michel and inform him of
what has transpired. <I>Wunschkonzert </I>in contrast, would subordinate
the whims, desires and actions of individuals to the larger mapping of
<I>volkish </I>identity and the goals of the fatherland. Herbert Koch is
about to go to Hamburg for his appointed rendezvous with Inge, only to be
called once more to duty. Without batting an eyelash he rushes off to do
battle over the Atlantic. "Duty is Duty" <I>(Dienst ist Dienst) </I>he
is heard to mutter under his breath as he runs out the door. Rather
than a failure of will, this act is coded as yet another proof of his
supreme devotion to a higher cause. Only when the time is right on a
larger scale will they or can they be reunited.

<P>
And there is also the matter of humor and slapstick in the two films. In
<I>Love Affair, </I>Michel and Terry are shown initially as superficial,
non-serious types: the comedy and screwball antics serve to contrast and
highlight their shift to seriousness as lovers and as working, engaged
people, as well as the film's potential shift toward seriousness as
melodramatic tragedy. In <I>Wunschkonzert </I>the comedy serves above all



<B></B>



to distract from the seriousness of war. The comic performances within
the framework of the radio program, as well as the playfulness and
antics in working out the main love plot and various subplots, serve to
fold the invasions of foreign countries, the violence and death of air
and ground warfare, into the inexorable flow toward the comedic happy
end. The national domestication of the <I>Volk </I>is also in part the
domestication of world war.

<P>
In an article written about <I>Wunschkonzert </I>shortly before its
premiere in 1940, Nazi critic Florian Kienzl uses the film to propound the
theory that "the episodic gains importance in films about the present day
by reflecting the <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>as a collection of individual
destinies." Where traditional dramatic and cinematic representations have
tended to neglect the smaller roles, often casting them with inexperienced
actors while playing up the centrality of the lead actors, films like
<I>Wunschkonzert </I>

<P>
Kienzl's argument reveals two paradigmatic forms of Nazi cooptation. The
first is that of a left-wing, even Brechtian oriented aesthetics by a
populist cultural politics based on volk rather than class. In the name of
a more epic focus upon "episodic res," films like <I>Wunschkonzert
</I>are seen to realign (if not radically decenter) the privileged
individuals of the main plot in a call for an "imaginary world" made up
of "many destinies." In Nazi discourse, the word destiny is often used
in place of the word individual; just as "difference" and "conflict" are
thematized at the same moment they are said to be subsumed and transcended
into a greater whole: "The new contemporary film, this mirror of a folk
which consensually unites in service to the <I>Vaterland, </I>has created
a form which grants to every performer <I>[Darsteller] </I>an equal task
in the service of art."

<P>
Kienzl's representation of the role of film within a modern culture
industry is equally revealing: the Hollywood seamless narrative, while not
completely abandoned, becomes reconred within a larger discursive
complex that would acknowledge the centrality of the stars and the
main plot, while simultaneously valorizing "the richness of the events
revolving around this little kernel" as being "just as important, if
not more important." As a corrective to this position, it should not be
forgotten that the highly successful marketing campaign for this film over
the one-year period prior to its release in December of 1940 was aimed
explicitly and repeatedly at the drawing power of the two lead actors;
and that Ilse Werner and Carl Raddatz both dramatically enhanced their
careers because of their starring roles and, I would argue, the centrality
of the main narrative in <I>Wunschkonzert. </I>As is well known,



<B></B>



Werner's initial reluctance to accept the part was overruled by an adamant
Goebbels, who saw in her the "sympathetic prototype of the refreshing,
modern woman," a re who would help bind this disparate film together
through her combination of the girl-next-door look (Werner was nineteen
at the time of the film) and the allure of a modern star.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
Having discussed the importance of the Hollywood model for the reworking
of political messages in the <I>Wunschkonzert, </I>let us conclude now
with some final words about the role of mass culture more generally in
the Third Reich during this period. Clearly what became particularly
significant strategically for the regime with the beginning of the
war was the use of popular cultural forms--film, radio, popular music,
sports--in order to garner support at a time of crisis. For instance, the
brief appearance of the clarinet jazz band in <I>Wunschkonzert </I>can be
viewed today as both a form of cooptation as well as a trope thematizing
a forbidden and potentially subversive history in the Third Reich. What
was called Jewish jazz or Negro jazz, or <I>"Volk</I>-alien Americanism,"
much of which had come into Germany via Hollywood musicals and comedy,
was officially banned in German radio after 1935. While this prohibition
was also meant for the recording industries and public nightlife, there
was in fact a surge in the enjoyment of American music in the late
thirties. Music by Tommy Dorsey, Coleman Hawkins, Count Basie, Artie
Shaw, and Fats Waller was distributed by the major record companies,
even after the outbreak of the war.

<P>
Nazi efforts to combat this "swing bacillus" ranged from periodic,
mostly unsuccessful attempts at prohibition, on the one hand, and a
more concentrated strategy in the area of public broadcasting to replace
it with what Goebbels himself called "quality entertainment music," on
the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 And this is precisely what we see being presented in the
 "Wunschkonzert." As highly watered down, often sentimentalized or
 kitschified variations of high swing, it was intended to meet the
 need for popular music, and in so doing also to counter or at least
 neutralize the infiltration of the more sophisticated forms of New
 Orleans Jazz and Benny Goodman swing that were being broadcast into
 Germany via Radio Luxembourg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P>
"Light entertainment music" then was just another form of
domestication. Like the reinscription of Hollywood film and the
theologizing of the radio, its ultimate purpose was to utilize the
modes of a modern culture industry in the remaking of the Reich as a
national family. The film <I>Wunschkonzert </I>brings together a number
of differing media working intertextually to support the cause. In
his bestselling book entitled <I>We Begin the "Wunschkonzert" for the
Armed Forces, </I>Heinz Goedecke, the creator and moderator for the
"Wunschkonzert," tells the illustrated story of the program.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Published in 1940 to dovetail with the appearance of the film, several
 of the anecdotes are renditions of the plot and subplot of the movie;
 just as a number of the photographs of stars from stage, screen, and
 music hall who have frequented the program also appear in the film. As
 one of the most successful productions of the Nazi public sphere, the
 "Wunschkonzert," in all of its permutations, was an entertainment
 <I>Gesamtkunstwerk </I>(total art work) that would anticipate
 developments for years to come.

While the "Wunschkonzert" of 1936 was the first such program to appear
under this name, the genre of telephone-request programs was introduced
in Germany as early as July, 1924, by the S&uuml;dwestdeutsche
Rundfunkgesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main. See Harald Heckmann,
"Die Institution "Wunschkonzert," <I>Mitteilungen. Studienkreis und
Geschichte</I> 2 : 90-7, for a brief history of the program
and its roots in England as well as the Weimar period. See also Heinze
Schr&ouml;ter, <I>Unterhaltung f&uuml;r Millinoen: Vom Wunschkonzert zur
Schlagerparade</I> (Dusseldorf and Vienna: Econ Verlag, 1973), and Heinze
Goedecke and Wilhelm Krug (the organizers of the Nazi "Wunschkonzert"),
<I>Wir beginnen das Wunschkonzert f&uuml;r die Wehrmacht</I> (Berlin and
Leipzig: Nibelungen-Verlag). These anecdotal works give further historical
information on the background to this type of prgram. Goedecke and Krug
tell the story of an accidental phone call to a radio show on Christmas
Eve 1935 giving rise to the introduction of the program two weeks later,
as though there had never been "Wunschabend" or "Wunschnachmittage"
programs in the 1920s.

See Marc Silberman, <I>German Cinema: Texts in Context</I> (Detroit: Wayne
State University Press, 1995) for a discussion of <I>Wunschkonzert</I>
as an example of "fascist discourse." While I agree with Silberman that
the film uses events of the recent past (Olympics, Spanish Civil War,
etc.) to construct "a historical precedent for the fascist perspective,"
the more long-range historical mythology that the film at once invents and
addresses has to do with the "stab[s] in the back" of World War I. The
stunning and rapid cinematic victories on land, sea, and air, together
with the professed medial achievement of radio to bind together war front
and home front, are staged as marked "historical" contrast to the failures
of the earlier time. (See the von Borsody quote above, where he clearly
links the "Wunschkonzert" to an overcoming of the earlier failure.)
