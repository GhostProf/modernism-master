<p id="lead">In 1931, anthologist and critic James Weldon Johnson edited the second edition of <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> to demonstrate that "there has grown a general recognition that the Negro is a contributor to American life not only of material but of artistic, cultural, and spiritual values; that in the making and shaping of American civilization he is an active force, a giver as well as a receiver, a creator as well as a creature."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Here, Weldon Johnson alludes to a commonplace of the period for all writers—culturally representative objects assert cultural power. There are, of course, contested meanings in the interpretations of objects that represent the authenticity of a culture, or that represent contested cultural identities. I place my reading of Helene Johnson's poem "Bottled" within the context of the discipline of anthropology and the idea of culture, both of which were undergoing radical changes in the early decades of the twentieth century. Anthropologist Franz Boas, his student Zora Neale Hurston, and others were theorizing and writing about the concept of culture—what later became known in anthropological circles as the "culture concept"—with the aim of disrupting and replacing the racist evolutionary comparativism's school of thinking with theories of cultural relativism.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Evolutionary comparativism held that cultures existed on a spectrum, from primitive to civilized, and that race was a key factor in determining which culture needed to evolve (these were assumed to be non-white and non-European) and which culture was already evolved (assumed to be white and European). Boas's assumptions 

<b></b>

 of cultural relativity held that all cultures were equally valuable and viable.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As a friend of and correspondent with Hurston, poet Helene Johnson would have been well aware of modernist theories of culture.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In "Bottled" , Johnson puts authentic and inauthentic into dialogue when she puts an imagined African jungle into a poem set on the real streets of New York City.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The speaker of the poem admires the (imagined) cultural adornments and proud dancing of a man in the streets of Harlem. The speaker reports that he dances to jazz, American music that has some of its roots in Africa but is not in and of itself wholly African; she also imagines this man as he would be if he were in Africa. He functions as a cultural object in the poem, a cultural object with contested authenticities. Johnson's use of a mixture of cultural tropes reveals her awareness of and attentiveness to theories of cultural relativism. Her poetry asserts an authenticity for objects of culture while it simultaneously calls that authenticity into question. The effect is to contribute to the concept of culture as a fluid, ever-shifting construct. </p>

<p>Without an authentic object, performance, or person to show the evidence of a culture, without objects of culture produced by the participants of that culture, how can that culture be taken as real, as authentic? The elision and erasure of black self-representation in literature and in other arts concerned Weldon Johnson and other black leaders. To that end, he chose to collect poems written by black poets into a representative anthology; he included Helene Johnson (1907–1995) in his second edition, introducing her poems by writing that she had "taken, so to speak, the racial bull by the horns," and, that she "bears the stamp of a genuine poet" (<i>ANP,</i> 279). I note this phrase—<i>genuine poet</i>—and I wonder what might make Johnson fake? Weldon Johnson does not define "genuine poet" beyond his assertions in his prefatory note to her poems that a "number of her best poems are done in colloquial style" and that "she realizes the hard fact that an effective poem in colloquial style demands as much work and workmanship as a well-wrought sonnet. Miss Johnson also possesses true lyric talent."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  There is here an assumption of a natural connection between authenticity, subjectivity, and originality. Too often, authenticity is associated with a poet only through one element of subjectivity— race or gender, say—elements that make up what John Paul Riquelme, during our Chicago seminar, called a "positive disruptive multiplicity."  </p>

<p>Another seminar colleague, Jane Kuenz, observes that our "biggest" and "first mistake when addressing issues of authenticity and black writers is to assume that 'authenticity' means something [. . .] qualitatively different from what it means for everyone else at the time." She notes that the idea of "the authentic" concerned black writers just as it concerned non-black writers; race was just one of many elements that contribute to a black writer's construction of the modern. Concerns about an authentic American art were not new in the modernist era. In "Democratic Vistas"  Walt Whitman wrote that "America has yet morally and artistically originated nothing. She seems singularly unaware that the models of persons, books, manners, etc., appropriate for former conditions and for European lands, are but exiles and exotics here."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Whitman and others saw American literature as simply European literature, transplanted 

<b></b>
into
  new soil but retaining its old form. Decades later, Whitman's concern had not entirely disappeared. In 1921, Weldon Johnson asserts that black America originated American artistic expression. Weldon Johnson contends in the preface to his first edition of <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> that "the Negro [. . .] has [. . .] proven the possession of [artistic] powers by being the creator of the only things artistic that have yet sprung from American soil and been universally acknowledged as distinctive American products."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Black leaders assumed that self-representation by and through a "genuine poet," as Weldon Johnson called Helene Johnson, was important both to the project of claiming a distinct black culture and to the project of entering into the wider American culture while disrupting the normative force of that culture. Weldon Johnson therefore argued that black writers grew out of American soil; they were not the transplanted "exiles" Whitman worried about.  </p>

<p>I do not know if Helene Johnson is a "genuine poet"—nor do I know if such a person exists in any absolute sense—but I do know that Johnson wrote poetry that puts the authentic and the fake together, bumping any reader who expects to find only one authenticity of expression off-center. Readers seeking a steady, absolute authentic expression of race in Johnson's poetry will instead find themselves moving in and around oscillating, spiraling images, images that are always a little bit true, images that are always a little bit fake—images like the focal point of "Bottled," a dancing man treated as a cultural object. Her poem's speaker addresses a listener who is given no voice in the poem; neither do we hear what the object of the speaker's attention—the dancing man—has to say. This elision undermines the extent to which the speaker's words should be trusted; we have here an unreliable narrator, one whose observations and assertions should not be taken entirely at face value, but should not be entirely discounted, either. </p>

<p>The speaker begins by placing herself in Harlem, itself placed in a contested relation to Africa: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Upstairs, on the third floor<br />
Of the 135th Street library<br />
In Harlem, I saw a little<br />
Bottle of sand, brown sand,<br />
Just like the kids make pies<br />
Out of down at the beach.<br />
But the label said: "This<br />
Sand was taken from the Sahara desert."<br />
Imagine that! The Sahara desert!<br />
Some bozo's been all the way to Africa to get some sand.</p>

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">For this speaker, Africa is simply a collected museum piece in the library; only a "bozo" would be interested in going so far to collect something that merely resembles quotidian sand played with by ordinary kids. Though it is difficult to say what the speaker's gender, age, or race are, she is probably black because of the references to 

<b></b>

 living in the neighborhood: she was in the 135th Street library, and the day before, "on Seventh Avenue," she saw the dancing man.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  I suggest that <i>not</i> giving the speaker an explicit gender usefully blurs the lines of gender and allows for the possibility of female public power, as the speaker sees, observes, and participates in a public act of cultural awareness. Giving the speaker a specific racial identity allows for the poem to be more than a public assertion of cultural credibility; it allows a black speaker to be part of the process of constructing the concept of culture that in turn allows for multiple, performative possibilities in what John Paul Riquelme refers to as "processes of refusal" that transform the self, but not in any absolute way.  </p>

<p>Initially, the speaker joins the crowd on the city streets in Harlem in offensively making fun of a "darky dressed fit to kill" in "yellow gloves and swallow-tail coat" (ibid.). The speaker joins in the crowd's derision towards this "fake" man dressed in the trappings of bourgeois dress; joins them, that is, until the man begins to dance and the speaker begins really to look at his face, emphasized by the seven times the verb "see" is used in the poem (in various tenses). The offensive slang words (shine, darky) used by the speaker to refer to the black dancer could be racial self-hatred, but, significantly, it is at this moment that she begins to ascribe subjectivity to the dancer, even while "everyone / Was laughing at him." </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . Me too,<br />
At first, till I saw his face<br />
When he stopped to hear an<br />
Organ grinder grind out some jazz.<br />
Boy! You should a seen that darky's face!<br />
It just shone. Gee, he was happy!<br />
And he began to dance. No<br />
Charleston or Black Bottom for <i>him</i>.<br />
No sir. He danced just as dignified<br />
And slow. No, not slow either.<br />
Dignified and <i>proud!</i> You couldn't<br />
Call it slow, not with all the<br />
Steps he did. You would a died to see him.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




 

<p class="continued">The speaker's reportage shifts as she assumes the dancer rejects the "Charleston or Black Bottom"—dances that by this period had been made popular for white audiences (who usually danced them exuberantly) by black performers. The dancer in "Bottled" instead dances "Dignified and <i>proud!</i>"  </p>

<p>The speaker not only listens and reports the crowd's reaction to this "real" dancing by a man in "fake" clothes, but she also reports her correctives to the crowd's reactions, based upon what she believes she can see in the dancer's face: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The crowd kept yellin' but he didn't hear,<br />
Just kept on dancin' and twirling that cane<br />
And yellin' out loud every once in a while.

<b></b><br />

I know the crowd thought he was coo-coo.<br />
But say, I was where I could see his face,<br />
And somehow, I could see him dancin' in a jungle,<br />
A real honest-to-cripe jungle, and he wouldn't leave on them<br />
Trick clothes—those yaller shoes and yaller gloves<br />
And swallow-tail coat. He wouldn't have on nothing.<br />
And he wouldn't be carrying no cane.<br />
He'd be carrying a spear with a sharp fine point<br />
Like the bayonets we had "over there":<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> <br />
And the end of it would be dipped in some kind of<br />
Hoo-doo poison. And he'd be dancin', black and naked<br />
and gleaming.<br />
And he'd have rings in his ears and on his nose,<br />
And bracelets and necklaces of elephants' teeth.<br />
Gee, I bet he'd be beautiful then, I bet.<br />
No one would laugh at him then, I bet.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Literally seeing and ratively imagining the real become conflated here. The speaker assumes that the dancing man does not belong there in the streets and that he is trapped by the clothing he wears; yet she also assumes that he transports himself to the African jungle and into suitably authentic adornments by listening to jazz, an urban music and black cultural form, and that he maintains dignity despite his surroundings, despite the crowd's laughter at his expense. Her admiration for this feat (which is really an act of her own imaginative projection) reveals an atavistic nostalgia for an Africa lost, and for an Africa imagined—in the form of a "real honest-to-cripe jungle." Roger Rothman's speculations about Dalí  's possibly deliberate use of "the fake" are to the point here; perhaps the tropes Johnson uses are deliberately fake, not naively engendered through a nostalgia for that which may not exist. And yet the possibility that a strong black warrior <i>could</i> exist and <i>could</i> be admired is also very much to the point. Maybe, we are meant to take this fake image as real—as the adjectival phrase "real honest-to-cripe" indicates. As conceived of in this period, cultural relativity allows for the possibility that the power—the spear, the magic, the fact that no one would laugh—and the beauty of the culture the speaker of this poem desires to see are all quite real, quite authentic. </p>

<p>Note, however, that the speaker is not really sure what would be found in Africa; the transported dancing man is imagined there, indicated by the use of the words "would" and the repeated phrase "I bet" after her description of imagined Africa ends. Africa as ordinary bottled sand becomes Africa as site of potential empowerment that ironically relies upon the speaker's power to bottle up the man, as well. No one, the speaker asserts, would laugh at this man if he were not in New York City; it is implied that he would be able to reach his full power from his "true" locale—a locale that is, of course, fictional, imagined, fake. This invites the question of whether his supposed power is fake, too.  
<b></b>

  </p>

<p>The speaker concludes by coming to a "sudden" realization that the man on the street is like the sand in the bottle: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Say! That man that took that sand from the Sahara desert<br />
And put it in a little bottle on a shelf in the library;<br />
That's what they done to this shine, ain't it? Bottled him.</p>
<p>Those trick shoes, trick coat, trick cane, trick everything; all bottle;<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> <br />
But, <i>inside</i>—<br />
Gee, that poor shine!</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The speaker identifies the man with the actual soil, or sand, of Africa; he <i>is</i> that earth, metonymic of captured Africa, trapped within the "bottle" of America, with its history of slavery and its cultural trappings of middle-class desires—the suit, the coat, the cane. Her laughter at the man shifts to her musings about what he could be, and what he might <i>truly</i> be, "inside." Her recognition that he has been bottled up and put onto display causes the speaker both to pity him and to admire him because of his self-contained reality. The speaker's reaction of derision, then admiration, then pity for the bottled-up man reveals a complicated kind of cultural awareness, reading, and claim. She has, after all, collected and displayed her own version of this man. For her, this dancing man can only be admired as a man when she imagines him in Africa, or in an African setting; the implication is that he cannot be admired here on the city streets of New York. And yet, it seems clear that this is a typical flawed narrator: she laughs along with the crowd before she knows what she is seeing; she reports that the dancer does not know the crowd is there, but it is not clear how we would know this—the dancer is not given a voice to tell us this, directly. In the end, the speaker reveals her speculative awareness of the potential human drama unfolding in front of her, not only because of her act of really looking at his face and body, but also because of her imagination about where this man would need to be in order to be truly, authentically "proud." </p>

<p>The speaker's metaphorical collection of this man and her analysis of his authenticity recalls the World Exposition, such as the one held in Chicago in 1893. Expositions displayed living people as well as the objects they used and produced; the displays were usually designed to assert and to affirm then-prevalent anthropological theories of evolutionary comparativism that put European culture at the top and non-European cultures at the bottom of a hierarchical cultural scale.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  She seems to be making the very same bottling gesture. However, by placing the dancing man into an imagined but "honest-to-cripe jungle," one that could transform the man into an object of admiration and not just curiosity, the speaker asserts a theory of cultural relativism that was coming of age in the early decades of the twentieth century. But she also calls into question the very possibility of finding and displaying genuine objects—the man, the spear with its poison tip, the jazz, even the swallowtail coat—while she asserts the need for making that very move. I would argue that Johnson is not simply using the trope of the dancing man in a jungle cynically—creating a deliberate fake—nor is she overcome by the 

<b></b>

 racist trope, defaulting to a non-reflective admiration of the primitive. I think that we have to allow for the use of the objects as real, authentic, and genuine representatives of a culture, as well. They are, simultaneously, deliberately fake and deliberately real. What if, she seems to ask, <i>what if</i> we considered this naked man as <i>cultured,</i> not just an ethnographic "type"?<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I am intrigued by the act of cultural collecting that takes place in some of Johnson's poems, poems in which "real" cultural objects are given power, only to have that power partially (but only partially) undermined by a realization of their inauthenticity. In "Bottled," we get the sense of a real lived experience (therefore an authentic experience), an idealized imagined experience (therefore an inauthentic experience), and a deliberate fake experience—(authentic? inauthentic?). Johnson's poem asserts a kind of authenticity grounded in the fake, grounded in that which cannot be proven nor found in the real, while it also asserts a kind of inauthenticity grounded in the "real."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This interrogation of authenticity takes place in the poetry as Johnson collects and displays cultural objects, or ideas of culture, in her poetry to create a new poetics. Perhaps she could be seen as a part of what Roger Rothman calls a "counter-modernism [. . .] in which the confusion of the true and the false, the real and the fake, is understood not as a threat (or not merely as a threat), but as an opportunity." Johnson usefully does not mark out an absolute authenticity of race or culture in her poetry. She fails to endorse what racial or cultural authenticity would be, though her poetry often takes the lived experiences of black people as its origin point. Writing both within and against the European tradition, both replicating and resisting the European tradition of poetry in English, Johnson claims multiple meanings of the culture concept and demonstrates a cultural off-centeredness, which is, as ethnographer James Clifford puts it, "a state of being in culture while looking at culture, a form of personal and collective self-fashioning."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Johnson is neither exclusively participant in culture nor observer of culture; rather, she opens up her poetics to include a full range of "authentic" experiences that both assert and refute the idea of authenticity.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

Though Weldon Johnson found Helene Johnson's work to be authentic, when we move from the reception in the Harlem Renaissance period to the present we find that current reception of her poetry varies: SallyAnn H.

Andrews, et al., eds. <i>The Oxford Companion to African American Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 404. Nina Miller, however, rightly sees Johnson as a vital revisionist of the lyric female voice; Johnson's poetic authenticity rests upon its avant-garde nature which Miller locates in her assumption that all of the speakers of the poems (save one, in "Bottled") are female and thus the poems contain <i>public</i> black female voices in urban settings. <i>Making Love Modern: The Intimate Public Worlds of New York's Literary Women</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 209–41.

I am attentive here to the speaker's identity in part because Nina Miller claims that this poem "is the only one of Johnson's poems to utilize an explicitly male voice, but one imagines that its success stems not from the gender of the speaker per se, but from the exuberant sense of urban mastery his gender affords him." Miller, <i>Making Love Modern,</i> 234. Miller bases her reading on the speaker's reference to a kind of gun that "we" had "over there" in World War I, and she asserts that this makes the speaker male because only males went to battle at this time. But it is not at all unusual for men and women alike to use the collective pronoun "we" when referring to what soldiers do, or for that matter, what governments do in state action. Though her assertion helps Miller make her overall argument about structures of power in a public place, with which I agree, it requires reading a specific gender into a poem that I contend does not reveal its speaker's gender.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>. "Over There" was a song written by George M. Cohan after the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917. The refrain is, in part: "over there over there / Send the word, send the word over there / the Yanks are Coming / [. . .] We'll be over, we're coming over, / And we won't be back till it's over

/ Over there." Retrieved from the Library of Congress web pages on 30 May 2007. &lt;<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/songs_times/flash.html">http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/songs_times/flash.html</a>&gt; This line of the poem is surely a reference to black participation in W.W.I. As David Levering Lewis reports it, in February 1919 "the men of the Fifteenth Regiment of New York's National Guard marched home to Harlem. Their valor under fire (191 unbroken days in the trenches) was legendary." <i>When Harlem Was in Vogue</i> (New York: Knopf, 1981), 3. Hopes held by blacks that their participation in the war would lead to recognition of their rights to citizenship and respect were reduced by the rise in lynchings and race riots in what was known as the Red Summer of 1919. See Robert T. Kerlin's 1920 compilation of "colored press," in which he includes a section called "The Negro's Reaction to the World War" in <i>The Voice of the Negro, 1919</i> (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1920), 31–50. The frontispiece of <i>The Voice of the Negro, 1919</i> is a photograph, titled "Conference group of Negro editors, with a few white friends, in Washington, during the war." Arrayed on the steps of some unnamed capitol building are black men in suits, with a few white men in suits and four white men in military uniform. Kerlin was a white editor and professor of English at Virginia Military Institute. </p>

See the debate over what constitutes an appropriate method of representing cultures in Ira Jacknis, "Franz Boas and Exhibits: On the Limitations of the Museum Method of Anthropology," In <i>Objects and Others,</i> George Stocking, Jr., ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985), 75–111. Simply put, Boas argued against the arrangement of objects in museums according to type (rattles or spears from many groups of people, all displayed together at types of tools, for example, without regard to context), and argued for the arrangement of objects according to who used those objects (rattles and spears from one tribe or group should be separated out, he argued, and put into context with labels for teaching purposes. In addition, mannequins should be used to give the objects more "life"). Evolutionary comparativism held that people, as well, could be classified as types based upon how "evolved" they were. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT15" href="#REF15">15</a>. As my seminar colleagues have shown, we have a considerable base of knowledge of the biographies of other modernists. However, we do not know much about Helene Johnson, and we have only have scant records of what she thought of her poetry—mostly, we know she struggled to find time to write. What we do know is gleaned from letters between her and Hurston, and between her and her cousin and fellow writer Dorothy West. Cheryl Wall, in her Foreword to Mitchell's edition of Johnson's poems, writes that Johnson guarded her private life, evading interviews and public appearances (<i>TWL,</i> xi–xii). I therefore purposefully write that Johnson's poem—not Johnson herself—asserts, or does not assert, a particular cultural stance. I have no evidence of Johnson's intentions, and can only speculate based upon her poetry and her historical context. </p>
