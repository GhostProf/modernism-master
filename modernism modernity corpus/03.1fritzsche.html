Soon, the twentieth century will be put into a museum. Its curators will 
face 
many difficult tasks: how to arrange its galleries and exhibits, and where 
to put 
the horror of Nazism? In one scenario, the museum might be dominated by a 
long 
corridor, a spatial counterpart to a time line, with the central gallery 
culminating in a triumphant display of democratic political systems, 
market-oriented economies, and thoroughly global communications, a display 
whose 
artifacts might include the "Good War," the Internet, and the Kronos 
Quartet. 
Approaching these objects through the central gallery, one would pass a 
series of 
other corridors diverging to the left and the right, corridors housing 
shrill 
political manifestos, uniformed youth brigades, and pale-colored ration 
cards, 
all recalling the once confident enemies of liberalism: the communists, the 
fascists, the Nazis, and other political "utopians." The central gallery 
would 
serve as a reliable moral compass, celebrating the righteousness of the 
West 
(France, the United States, and Great Britain), drawing attention to the 
once 
wayward East (Germany and Russia). The defining event of the century would 
be 
World War II, one that put in proper place and perspective the entire 
century. 
National Socialism, in particular, would provide a frightening, 
anachronistic 
contrast to the political liberty and social emancipation that Europe has 
achieved in the last decades. Yet such a marvelous museum might well be too 
perfect. Outside, the furies of nationalism, the prospect of wholesale 
ecological 
degradation, and persistent economic fears would continue to assault the 
certainties on display inside. 

<p>
Alternatively, to acknowledge the indeterminate aspects of our own fin de 
si&egrave;cle, the gallery could be laid out less strictly, less 
confidently. 
Instead of a central gallery with diverging corridors to regulate the flow 
of 
impressions, the building would house a shifting conration of clusters 
and 
nodes, and exhibits from the same decade might be widely scattered and 
juxtaposed 
with apparently alien materials. The artifacts would be assembled not to 
reveal 
the twentieth century's progressive advance, but to trace and dramatize its 
curious collaborations, the collusions that made the century possible: the 
different histories that it drew upon, the glorious nostalgias that it 
fashioned, 
and the various futures that it imagined. Whereas the first museum would 
house 
the displays of liberal modernization, celebrating the enhanced ability of 
individuals to mobilize resources in the context of a highly differentiated 
capitalist economy and an open political democracy, the second would chart 
the 
genealogies of modernism, tracing the different ways that people and 
institutions 
have tinkered to make themselves secure in the dangerous zones of a 
constantly 
changing world.

Obviously, Nazism has a claim for inclusion 
in such 
a retrospective exhibition because it provided one, albeit extreme, answer 
to the 
economic and political crises of post-World War I Germany. Its claim is 
compelling not because National Socialism bears resemblance to the modern 
democracies of the period after World War II, or because it adopted and 
celebrated automobiles, airplanes, and other futuristic technology, but 
because 
it conceived of Germany as both the object of the social and economic 
forces of 
industrialization and, thanks to those same forces, as a potential subject 
that 
possessed the capacity to reorganize political life and prosper amid 
dangerous 
conditions. The Nazis were modernists because they made the acknowledgment 
of the 
radical instability of twentieth-century life the premise of relentless 
experimentation. 
<p>
For most historians, Nazism has been regarded as the improbable outcome of 
disastrous political and economic conditions. Germany's precipitous 
military 
defeat in 1918, the near civil-war conditions that followed the 
revolution, the 
hyperinflation of 1922 and 1923, the long-winded recession in the 
mid-1920s, and 
finally the devastation of the Great Depression all added up to a 
worst-case 
scenario in which the rise of Hitler becomes comprehensible. Almost any 
textbook 
on the Weimar Republic will take readers through this house of horrors and 
lead 
them straight to the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. (Indeed, Nazis 
and 
neo-Nazis are routinely regarded as the most reliable register of the 
troubles of 
both the first and the second German republics; Nazism, seen in this way, 
stands 
for system failures of one sort or another.) Once in power, the National 
Socialist regime gained the acquiescence of the majority of the German 
people, 
but never enjoyed outright support. Faced with the costs of developing an 
incipient consumer-oriented economy, it chose instead to engage in 
increasingly 
spectacular and dangerous foreign policies to distract the public. For most 
Germans, the Nazi leaders were experienced as bosses and pashas of varying 
degrees of corruption. While the regime's most important ideological 
goals--the 
elimination of the Jews from German life and the subjugation of eastern 
<B></B>
 Europe--were pursued consistently, they were also 
pursued without popular 
consent. The combination of day-to-day venality and less discernable 
ideological 
scheming has encouraged historians to make distinctions between the 
"Nazis" and 
the "Germans," collective nouns whose overlap is never denied, but whose 
juxtaposition suggests mutual exclusion rather than degrees of 
equivalence. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Against the grain of conventional historiography, two kinds of arguments 
have 
been advanced that attempt to trace the traffic between National Socialism 
and 
modernity. Over thirty years ago, Ralf Dahrendorf and David Schoenbaum 
maintained 
that the Nazis must be seen as modernizers, who, willfully or not, made 
Germany 
significantly more modern in outlook and laid the foundations for the 
Federal 
Republic 
<I>(Bundesrepublik)</I>
 that would follow. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
Yet this 
well-known argument, which continues to be elaborated (and furiously 
countered), 
unduly restricts the notion of the modern to terms derived from the 
consumer 
economies of the post-World War II period; it slights the specific 
character of 
the Nazi exchange with modernity and forces it into a mold that was made 
much 
later, a 
<I>bundesrepublikanisch</I>
 mold. A more sophisticated approach 
has been 
developed by Detlev Peukert and Zygmunt Bauman, but has received less 
attention 
from historians. It eschews the Federal Republic as a model for assessing 
Nazism 
and instead examines the degree to which Nazism was invested in the 
renovative or 
therapeutic traditions of western civilization. These arguments are not 
without 
their own problems, some of which I shall explain more fully below, but 
they 
offer grounds for further development. In the first set of arguments, 
Nazis are 
claimed to be simply modernizers; in the second, they are, even if only 
potentially, modernists. 
<p>
Accounts that emphasize the modernizing nature of the Nazi regime entail 
that we 
reject the notion that Nazism was simply reactionary, merely defensive, or 
altogether unlikely, a spectacular creature unique to the tumultuous 
interwar 
years. At the same time, too much in the way of historical specificity is 
lost if 
we consider the Hitler regime as solely a developmental dictatorship, a 
mere 
stepping-stone to the more thoroughgoing modernization of the Federal 
Republic. 
Such a view places too much weight on the unintended consequences of Nazi 
politics and too much emphasis on the explicit contents of specific social 
policies. Furthermore, it can also lead, and in fact unfortunately has 
led, to a 
"mainstreaming" of the National Socialists, turning them into 
first-generation 
progressives and effectively consigning their racism more and more to the 
margins. Finally, the concept of modernization is too normative, 
encouraging 
observers to look at the past in terms of the present. The notion of 
modernism, 
in contrast, offers a more open-ended way of mapping the initiatives, 
blueprints, 
and experiments by which contemporaries tried to build lasting, possibly 
illiberal structures in the circumstances of radical instability. It 
requires 
that we focus less on unintended consequences, more on underemphasized 
premises, 
and that we view National Socialism as a distinctive, horrifying, but 
nonetheless 
plausible version of social renovation. That is not easy, for it makes the 
Nazis 
much more familiar, much more like us; it undermines cherished notions of 
how 
different "they" 
<B></B>
 are from "us" or "we" are from 
"them," eroding the 
congenial assumption that modernizers leave racism behind as 
anachronistic. It 
suggests that we might have to consider the Nazis a genuinely popular 
political 
force, rather than merely a symptom of system failure. And if the Nazis are 
regarded as modernists and tinkerers who built a racial utopia in 
accordance with 
the scientific spirit, then the enlightenment tradition looks much more 
strange 
and ambiguous, a strangeness that insinuates itself into our own 
surroundings. 
Much, in fact, is at stake in this debate. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>The Third Reich as Prehistory to the Federal Republic</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
According to Ralf Dahrendorf and David Schoenbaum, the Nazis accelerated 
the 
transformation of Germany into a modern, highly differentiated industrial 
economy 
by mobilizing vast resources in pursuit of their political goals. Their 
aim was 
not the creation of a liberal republic; yet they fashioned its foundations 
by 
mobilizing citizens in an increasingly totalitarian manner, so destroying 
the 
basis of traditional authoritarian institutions such as the Prussian 
state, the 
military, and the aristocracy; eroding exclusive allegiances to political 
and 
cultural subgroups, such as socialists and Catholics; and weakening the 
hold of 
parochial structures, such as the family. In a precise turn of phrase, Axel 
Schildt summarizes Dahrendorf's argument: "Once there had been a 
<I>' Volksgenossen'</I>
 [people's comrade] there could be no return of the 
<I>'Untertan'</I>
 [traditional subject]." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
In other words, 
national 
mobilization forever foreclosed the authoritarian subject. After twelve 
years of 
the Third Reich, including six difficult war years, Germans increasingly 
interacted as individuals rather than social types, and lived according to 
the 
standards of a mobile, achievement-oriented consumer society, rather than 
by the 
customs and habits of enclosed social milieus. 
<p>
Even if, on David Schoenbaum's closer examination, the Nazis did not 
effectively 
break down social barriers and class divisions, as Dahrendorf had claimed, 
the 
regime profoundly reshaped the way people thought about themselves, and 
thus 
anticipated in the realm of attitude and expectation the more consequential 
transformations of the 1950s. For both Dahrendorf and Schoenbaum, however, 
modernization during the Third Reich was not a willful project, but an 
unintended 
consequence of the drastic mobilization in the name of antimodern, "blood 
and 
soil" dreams. The war, more than anything else, uprooted the "nation of 
provincials," laying the foundations for the much more homogeneous and 
mobile 
society of the postwar years. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">
5</A>
</SUP>
This functional reading of 
twentieth-century change assigns to the Nazis leading roles as 
modernizers, even 
though the Nazis themselves, despite the continuities that span the year 
1945, 
have long been seen as complete strangers to the consumer society of the 
Federal 
Republic. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The modernization that earlier scholars had regarded as unintentional, a 
younger 
generation of historians now insists was a central component of Nazi 
ideology. 
Rainer Zitelmann and Michael Prinz, in particular, have argued that Hitler 
and 
the Nazi 
<B></B>
 elite actively sought to fashion a more 
modern Germany, one that 
effectively constitutes the prehistory to the Federal Republic by virtue 
of its 
social-welfare planning, economic rationalization, and technocratic 
leadership. 
Defining modernization in terms of the social mobility and technological 
capacity 
of post-1949 Germany, Zitelmann draws a picture of Hitler as a nationally 
minded 
reformer whose intentions were very nearly realized. Thanks to the 
energetic 
efforts of Robert Ley, who headed the German Labor Front, the vision of "an 
equal-opportunity, upwardly mobile society purged of the old class and 
caste 
differences and encased within the framework of an extensively developed 
welfare 
state" was in fact translated into Nazi versions of the Beveridge Report, 
which 
were kept under wraps only due to the exigencies of total 
war. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
Ley's biographer, Ronald Smelser, has more sensibly noted that this 
"equal-opportunity" society was presupposed only in the name of German 
imperialism and only for racially acceptable Germans. While Zitelmann and 
Prinz 
do not ignore the racial context of these laws, they do treat Nazi social 
policy 
as wholly distinct from Nazi racial policy, and as a result their efforts 
to 
portray Hitler as a revolutionary modernizer leave out the most radical 
aspects 
of National Socialism, namely, racism and anti-Semitism. Moreover, their 
model of 
modernization excludes the political attributes--enhanced participation of 
freethinking individuals in the public sphere--with which it has always 
been 
associated. Indeed, Zitelmann deliberately severs social and economic 
progress 
from political liberalism. By rejecting normative approaches, he claims to 
encourage a more "value-free" discussion of modernization, a process he 
sees 
taking place in both totalitarian and liberal regimes. The tag of 
illiberalism, 
in other words, should not disqualify a candidate for the title of 
"modernizer." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The principal problem with Zitelmann's thesis is that it mistakes the 
means for 
the ends. Central to Hitler's worldview was the desirability of creating a 
racial 
state, and Nazi social policy was designed to advance this goal insofar as 
it 
created a healthier, more efficient, and more strictly gendered community 
of 
prospective soldiers, workers, and mothers. The wars against the Jews and 
the 
Slavs were not, as Zitelmann suggests, the F&uuml;hrer's sideshows to the 
main 
effort to make the German people more prosperous, nor were they, as 
G&ouml;tz Aly 
and Susanna Heim argue, the result of postwar planning to modernize and 
rationalize German capitalism. They were meant to reorder the biological 
hierarchy of the nation and the continent. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
Scholars have also 
criticized both Zitelmann and Prinz for taking too seriously the relentless 
initiatives of the German Labor Front and its wartime planning institute, 
the 
Arbeitswissenschaftliches Institut (the Ergonomics Institute), which, 
after all, 
owe as much to Ley's fantastic ambition as they do to an underlying 
ideological 
consensus among Nazi leaders. Yet the argument for intended modernization 
can be 
indulged because it rests mainly on intentions, not on results, the test 
by which 
Dahrendorf's and, to some extent, Schoenbaum's arguments have to be 
judged. To 
claim, therefore, that Nazi Germany remained divided by class or that 
social 
welfare provisions were inadequate, as critics do, does not invalidate 
Zitelmann's central 
<B></B>
 point about the Nazi leadership's 
conceptualization of 
itself. 
<p>
The debate over whether modernization (intended or not) did take place is 
likely 
to continue for some time. For the moment, it has reached a stalemate. On 
the one 
hand, some clarity has been provided by the careful macrosociological 
soundings 
of Jens Alber, who indicates that the Third Reich did not accelerate the 
long-term trends consistent with modernization (urbanization, expansion of 
the 
service sector, percentage of women working) and in some cases 
counteracted them 
(working-class access to higher education, professionalization in the civil 
service, religiously mixed marriages). Alber's argument has been 
underscored by 
historians who emphasize the absence of any meaningful social mobility, the 
prevalence of low wages among blue-collar workers, the largely illusory 
world of 
consumption, the deleterious effects of social-Darwinist polycracy, and the 
regime's hostile and self-destructive attitude toward scientific research. 
In the 
end, Alber draws a picture of German society in which the erosion of 
social life 
and the tentative nature of national consensus weakened the ability of the 
regime 
to mobilize citizens. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">
10</A>
</SUP>
On the other hand, local studies 
continue to 
lend plausibility to the argument in favor of modernization. R&uuml;diger 
Hachtmann, for example, maintains that shop-floor rationalization, improved 
working conditions, and service in the war combined to "deproletarianize" 
industrial workers. Numerous scholars also take seriously Nazi claims to 
honor 
workers, and argue that efforts to integrate them in the national 
community were 
not without effect. The German Labor Front, once again, has been credited 
with 
improving the status of workers, while analyses of the Hitler Youth or the 
social-service activities of middle-class women suggest that the regime's 
social 
policies enjoyed substantial support. The National Socialists were 
surprisingly 
popular insofar as they were identified with a new national mood that 
emphasized 
national integration, social reform, and economic prosperity. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Schoenbaum's distinction between social reality and interpreted social 
reality is 
perhaps the best way to make sense of the contradictory evidence. In the 
years 
1933-45, Germans lived in two worlds. Amidst a familiar universe of stable 
links 
to family, region, and social milieu, the Nazis constructed a "second 
world" out 
of "a network of organizations" in which "the traditional criteria of 
social 
worth and social placement had no validity." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
Schoenbaum, Hans 
Mommsen, and others dismiss this fascist public sphere as merely "happy 
illusion" 
<I>(sch&ouml;ner Schein)</I>
 but it is worth considering just how 
consequential 
was the impact of Nazi policies on social identity. To what extent did 
Germans 
regard themselves as 
<I>Volksgenossen,</I>
 as people's comrades? The 
degree of 
self-mobilization into the Nazi sphere is impressive: in each of the last 
years 
before the war, over one million volunteers participated in the annual 
<I>Winterhilfe</I>
 (winter help) charity drive; several million more young 
people 
were happily recruited into the Hitler Youth; more than two million workers 
enrolled in German Labor Front apprenticeship programs; as many as eight 
million 
Germans joined local civil-defense leagues; and an astonishing fifty-four 
million 
had, by 1938, participated in some sort of 
<I>Kraft durch Freude</I>
(Strength 
through Joy) activity. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
Wartime service only strengthened the 
role 
of National Socialist institutions and the validity of its 
<B></B>
 pitiless 
worldview in daily life. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
Germans, without relinquishing 
established 
ties to family, workmates, and neighbors, apparently moved relatively 
easily from 
one world to the other, adopting as they did the vocabulary of national 
integration, the messianism of the F&uuml;hrer cult, the terms of constant 
struggle, and eventually the identities of Aryan overlords vis-&agrave;-vis 
conquered civilians and foreign workers. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
<p>
That the National Socialist world crumbled so quickly in 1945, to the 
point that 
the 1949 elections appeared to revive the electoral parochialisms of the 
Weimar 
era, surely revealed the limits of the fascist dream world. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">
16</A>
</SUP>
But 
given the few years in which the Nazis had to mobilize--Ley's German Labor 
Front, 
for example, did not begin its vast re&euml;ducation effort until the end 
of 
1934--and the half-life that the collective experiences of National 
Socialism 
continued to lead in the 1950s and 1960s, it would be a mistake to assume 
that 
this world was superficial because incomplete. In this context, the 
well-known 
postwar surveys, in which even lower-income groups readily admitted that 
Nazism 
had positive aspects, are worth remembering. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
<p>
If the Nazis were modernizers, it was less on account of their efficacy in 
destroying traditional social milieus, as Dahrendorf claims, than of their 
capacity to manufacture an alternative public sphere in which Germans 
identified 
themselves increasingly as 
<I>Volksgenossen.</I>
 At least at certain times 
and 
places, they accepted Nazi premises about the equality of opportunity, 
responded 
to appeals in the name of the nation, and internalized many of the regime's 
hideous racial distinctions. There is considerable evidence that this 
fascist 
arena "deproletarianized" workers and validated individual achievement and 
thereby anticipated the consumer society of the 1950s. To confine the 
discussion 
of modernization to these terms, however, and so to regard National 
Socialism as 
a foundation for the Federal Republic, is to miss completely the first 
principle 
of Nazi politics, which was the construction of a racial "utopia" in 
Europe, not 
the establishment of a modern welfare state in Germany. Racial and social 
policy 
cannot be separated, as if the regime's efforts to eradicate whole peoples 
were 
tangential to otherwise beneficial policies on behalf of individuals. Even 
so, 
Zitelmann and Prinz have identified a crucial aspect of National Socialism 
that 
the historiographical emphasis on Nazi propaganda, Nazi terror, and Nazi 
genocide 
has missed: the degree to which the Nazis were committed to renovating 
German 
society. Although the Hitler regime cannot be adequately described as 
merely a 
German version of Beveridge's England or Roosevelt's America, the Nazis 
operated 
in the subjunctive tense, experimenting, reordering, reconstructing, and 
it is 
this spirit of renovation that qualifies National Socialism as modern. 
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--_a-head-->
<B>Nazis as Modernists</B>
<!--_/a-head--></H3>
<p>
The Nazi project was unabashedly racist. When Hitler's National Socialists 
came 
to power in January of 1933, they believed they stood at the very edge of 
history, poised to redirect the nation to fit the grooves of an envisioned 
Aryan 
future. The whole previous itinerary of Germany, in which a liberal sphere 
had 
been elaborated, in which 
<B></B>
 public claims had been put 
forward by political 
parties and interest groups, and in which various ethnic groups, provincial 
identities, and religious communities had survived and commingled, was to 
come to 
an abrupt halt. From the perspective of the Nazis, the year 1933 marked a 
sharp 
break. In place of the quarrels of party, the contests of interest, and the 
divisions of class that had so heavily compromised the ability of the 
nation to 
act, the Nazis proposed to build a unified racial community. 
<p>
On the one hand, the National Socialists sought to nurture the biological 
inheritance of Germans by putting in place an elaborate pronatalist 
social-welfare edifice and refurbishing the work place in a more rational 
manner. 
All the busy activity to promote family health, to reward parents with tax 
allowances, to extend young people technical training, and to provide 
workers 
with vacations and other diversions, may at first glance resemble an 
attractive 
"New Deal," but in fact was put in place to prepare Germans to assume 
roles as 
productive members of the national 
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I>
 (people's 
community). 
The emphasis of social policy was always on the enforcement of discipline 
in the 
name of the community, not the provision of opportunity for the 
individual. On 
the other hand, this constructive program of national health was 
accompanied by a 
stern eugenics administration that sought progressively to weed out alleged 
biological dangers to the German 
<I>Volk.</I>
 From the very beginning, the 
regime 
applied measures to identify, segregate, and eradicate debilitating or 
supposedly 
foreign matter. Mental or physical disabilities, homosexuality, 
alcoholism, and 
even promiscuous or "asocial" behavior marked millions of Germans as 
candidates 
for surveillance and sterilization. Local health boards eventually cleared 
the 
way for the sterilization of at least half a million men and women. At the 
same 
time, so-called 
<I>artfremd</I>
 (alien) groups, particularly Jews but also 
Gypsies, were progressively banished from German public life. By 1938, the 
Third 
Reich was committed to completely eliminating Jews from Germany, a policy 
that 
shifted in the war years to the elimination of all Jews in Europe. The 
ultimate 
result of racial nurturing and racial weeding was to be a well-regulated 
<I>v&ouml;lkisch</I>
 society, strong and homogeneous enough to prosper in 
the 
dangerous era of world wars. The long-term well-being of the German 
<I>Volk</I>
would be ensured by a vast empire in eastern Europe, one that would provide 
Germans with the space, raw materials, and slave labor necessary to 
survive the 
coming planetary struggles. With the massive deportation of Polish 
villagers from 
designated German core areas, the arrival of thousands of German colonists 
to 
reclaim "ancestral" lands, the conscription of local labor in those 
efforts, and 
the concentration, ghettoization, and finally outright murder of Polish 
Jews, 
occupied Poland after 1939 was the site where the Nazi utopia was realized 
to a 
large degree. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">

</SUP>
<p>
The broad outlines of this racial order have never been in doubt. For the 
most 
part, however, the "Final Solution" has been studied in isolation. As a 
result, 
the obsessive anti-Semitism of leading Nazis has emerged as a central 
motif in 
the explanation of Germany's twentieth-century barbarism. The racial 
utopia of 
the Third Reich appears as a flight from modern history, contemporary but 
atavistic. Yet when social welfare, genocide, and foreign conquest are 
regarded 
as parts of a whole, Nazi 
<B></B>
 racism appears less 
anachronistically demonic and 
more connected to contemporary social practices. To see only the 
provisions the 
Nazis made to ensure national health and national efficiency or only the 
terroristic administration of the sterilization, deportation, and mass 
killing is 
to miss the central role that the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper,</I>
 or the "body" 
of the 
nation, played in National Socialism. The Nazis were neither mere 
social-welfare 
innovators nor simply obsessed racial fanatics; rather, they were 
committed to an 
ambitious program of racial reclamation in which they drew liberally on the 
premises of modern social planning.

<p>
The notion of the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper</I>
 stands at the intersection where 
the 
confidence of experts in the ability of science and technology to solve 
social 
problems confronted the growing acknowledgment of the limits to such 
engineering. 
By the end of the nineteenth century, advances in epidemiology, in 
particular, 
had established a new paradigm of biomedical therapy in which the 
illnesses of 
industrial civilization could be identified and cured. As the number of 
social-welfare and medical professionals grew and the scope of social 
services 
expanded, the population became increasingly regulated by distinctions 
based on 
value and worth. The establishment of psychiatry, the professionalization 
of 
youth and social services, the administration of public health and public 
hygiene, the rationalization of the workplace, the emphasis on the 
rehabilitation 
of criminals, and the propositions of eugenics all suggested ways in which 
the 
biological quality of the nation could be improved by techniques of 
nurturing, 
selection, and eradication. Seen in this light, the advances of modern 
science 
realized the most cherished assumption of the enlightenment, namely that 
this 
worldly existence could be perfected by human design. Indeed, Zygmunt 
Bauman 
characterizes modern existence as the articulation of an activist or, as 
he puts 
it, the gardener's approach to life. To one degree or another, he argues, 
the 
reproduction of social life involves "separating and setting apart useful 
elements destined to live and thrive, from harmful and morbid ones, which 
ought 
to be exterminated." For Bauman, the garden does not stand for paradise. 
It is a 
place where the ideals of self-perfection encompass the techniques of 
extermination, where classical proportion has been exploded by the frenzy 
of wild 
flowers and fiendish experiments. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
Bauman regards modernity 
not as 
"a civilizing process (Elias), or as a process of the progressive 
rationalization 
of all spheres of social life (Weber)," but as a startlingly value-free 
culmination of routines of cultivation. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Detlev Peukert and the historians who have been influenced by him have 
advanced 
arguments similar to Bauman's around the Foucauldian theme of a 
therapeutic state 
that invests more and more resources to intervene and ostensibly reform 
social 
life. However, Peukert points out that the normative standards by which the 
interventions of social policy are formulated and justified are not, by 
themselves, sufficient to account for the murderous regime of National 
Socialism. 
Even considering the mounting frustrations of twentieth-century social 
planners 
as they bumped up against limits to reform, the persistence of illness and 
old 
age, or the intractability of juvenile delinquency, it took the harsh 
fiscal 
realities of the Great Depression to disassemble the grand optimism of 
universal 
health into various techniques of triage. 
<B></B>
 "In times 
of crisis," Peukert 
writes, the 
<I>Volksk&ouml;rper</I>
 was defined in increasingly "negative, 
restrictive terms. The central concern now becomes that of identifying, 
segregating, and disposing of those individuals who are abnormal or sick" 
("GFS," 
241). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
For Peukert a lethal combination of racism, abstract 
criteria 
of "value" and "nonvalue" in therapeutic practices, and high-technology 
solutions 
based on Depression-era cost-benefit analyses indicate that the "Final 
Solution" 
was "one among other possible outcomes of the crisis of modern 
civilization" 
("GFS," 236). 
<p>
What is frustrating about the pathbreaking analyses of both Peukert and 
Bauman is 
their insufficient appreciation of the fantastic vision of the National 
Socialists. The drive to renovate Europe along racial lines cannot be 
summed up 
either in the strict, delimiting terms of cost-benefit calculations or 
simply as 
one (horrible) version of the western ideal of self-cultivation. On the 
one hand, 
Peukert's emphasis on the Great Depression seems to me to be too narrow 
and, on 
the other, Bauman's generic vocabulary of improvement too broad a 
description of 
the Nazi racial project. 
<p>
A useful way of thinking about the links between the administration of 
modern 
reform and the extraordinary measures of National Socialism is to consider 
modernism in aesthetic terms. In literary criticism and art history, 
modernism 
encompasses new ways of looking that emerged at the turn of the century. 
The 
turbulence of metropolitan life pushed individuals onto uncertain pathways, 
undermined the ability of coherent story lines to narrate the topsy-turvy 
fullness of sensations and impressions, and put into doubt the practices of 
mimetic representation. It is this determination of impermanence that has 
characterized the idea of modernism. Not only was the present increasingly 
experienced as brand-new, completely different from the confines of even 
the 
recent past, but it was itself doomed to be merely transitory. Fashions, 
fads, 
and all ideas of the moment were thus typically modern creatures, bursting 
onto 
the scene with great energy before falling into disuse, persisting for a 
while as 
ruins, then disappearing again. It followed that any attempt to capture the 
essence of the age had to focus on these occasional features that 
Baudelaire 
described as 
<I>"le transitoire, le fugitif, le contingent."</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
To 
track the merely transitory was to represent the enduring nature of the 
age. 
<p>
The epistemological and aesthetic dimensions of modernism signal the 
discontinuous nature of social experience in the last centuries. Rather 
than a 
progressive articulation of power and possibility, civilization records the 
merely tentative security achieved in the face of inherent dangers. The 
rise of 
capitalism, the introduction of industrial technology, the establishment of 
central state administration, and the proliferation of military power that 
Anthony Giddens, for one, associates with the "created environment" of 
modernity, 
did not automatically advance the security of Europe. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
The 
threshold 
of risk advanced as well. Moreover, an increasingly well-regulated society 
generated new phobias as the definition and scope of social responsibility 
expanded. As a result, the practices of discipline that Peukert, Foucault, 
and 
many others see coalescing around the regulation of "the social" at the 
end of 
the nineteenth century were accompanied by revived premonitions of 
disaster. The 
<B></B>
 experiments and initiatives that were so confidently 
proposed were 
themselves only temporary measures, sure to give way to the fluctuations 
of time 
and to more novel and even more strenuous efforts at renovation. In light 
of the 
contingency of reform, modern social practices have often been scaled 
back, but 
the punctuation of catastrophe has also armed the imagination and 
emboldened 
experimentation. Over the last two hundred years, the identification of 
social 
debilities has led repeatedly to the creation of new therapeutic regimes. 
The 
National Socialists emerge as modernists because they made the 
acknowledgment of 
the discontinuity of history the premise of their fantastic political and 
racial 
designs. In what follows I want to explore more fully crisis and 
renovation as 
characteristics of the modern and of the Nazi modern.

The mastery over nature, which is the central tenet of modernization, 
increased 
the ability of men and women to manipulate the environment, but it also 
cast the 
natural world in ever more inimical and dangerous terms. In the seventeenth 
century, Francis Bacon and the master builders who followed him rewrote the 
nature they tried to rework, describing floods and storms and, later, 
emotions in 
increasingly chaotic and terrifying terms.

Steadily subduing 
but 
also suddenly exposing so many previously unrecognized dangers, the 
enlightenment 
appeared self-subverting and suspect from the outset. This ambivalence 
grew more 
serious over time because the potential of the industrial revolution 
revealed 
both the malleability and the fragility of the world. If nineteenth-century 
Europeans served the general cause of improvement, surveying wilderness, 
clearing 
forests, draining swamps, and digging mines, they also worried about the 
imminence of revolution, the fragility of the social order, the disease and 
poverty of the new industrial cities, and the biological degeneration of 
the 
modern individual. The insight of the engineer, the recognition of the 
sheer 
plasticity of the material world, always carried with it the 
acknowledgment of 
the impermanence of all thing--material edifices, market relations, social 
orders, moral persuasions. Especially after 1848, as the failures of 
liberal 
reform became clearer, corrosion came to be regarded as characteristic of 
industrialism as manufacture. "Social evolution," Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies 
wrote 
toward the end of the nineteenth century, "takes the form of continual 
disintegration." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The desperate dynamism of capitalism and industrialism furnished observers 
such 
as T&ouml;nnies with multiple visions of chaos and dissolution. However, 
the 
fugitive formations he identified did not preclude efforts at 
stabilization. On 
the contrary, the recognition of crisis gave nineteenth-century projects of 
reform their urgency. In the face of cholera epidemics, working-class 
revolution, 
and urban poverty, the modern experience added up to a relentless struggle 
to 
regulate and renovate civil society. Late nineteenth-century notions of 
national 
solidarity dramatized the importance of renovating the social body. 
Forward-looking statesmen envisioned the nation as a factory in which all 
hands 
worked together for the common good. They accordingly 
<B></B>
 propounded ambitious 
programs of national efficiency, trade protectionism, political 
enfranchisement, 
social hygiene, and overseas expansion. Not to take the road to reform was 
to 
renounce economic prosperity and risk social disintegration and national 
decline. 
Social pathology and social experimentation thus went hand-in-hand. Emile 
Durkheim, perhaps the most famous diagnostician of the social ills of 
modern 
civilization as a result of his work on suicide, compared the statesman to 
a 
physician: "He prevents the outbreak of illness by good hygiene, and he 
seeks to 
cure them when they have appeared." 
<SUP>

To come to terms with what Peukert has portrayed as the Janus face of 
modernity--the techniques of amelioration and the circumstances of 
degeneration--was to admit both the necessity and the provisional nature of 
reform.

For the civil servant or the public health official, 
as 
much as for the artist, the enduring aspect of the modern age was 
instability. 
Modernism, which has usually been conceived in literary or artistic terms, 
has 
remarkable social and political implications. It is the apprehension of the 
malleable: the dark acknowledgment of the fragility and impermanence of the 
material world allied with the conviction that relentless reform could 
steady 
collapsing structures. In this perspective, modernism breaks with the past, 
manufactures its own historical traditions, and imagines alternative 
futures. 
Indeed, by being reflexive and making instability the explicit premise for 
its 
practice, modernism is hospitable not only to anarchic individualism but 
also to 
authoritarian designs. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">
29</A>
</SUP>
In my view, it is the premises rather 
than 
the attributes of modern projects that need to be examined more closely. 
What 
makes the twentieth century so promiscuous is not the content of the 
identities 
people have fashioned or the designs they have erected, but the 
presumption that 
contingency abounds and has to be managed, that chaos is about to take 
over and 
has to be negotiated. Again and again, modernists staged history as a 
boundary 
situation. The most spectacular displays of modernism are not to be found 
in a 
museum of expressionist art or a collection of prose poetry, but in the 
avant-garde political collaborations that sought to come to terms with a 
brand-new world regarded as unstable and dangerous. With every step, the 
political adventurer as much as the modernist poet or painter revealed 
ground 
that was tremulous, breaking apart, unclear. Liberal certainties that 
proposed to 
reveal the coherence of the world appeared completely inadequate. But 
whereas the 
latter made manifest the disenchantment that had been revealed, the former 
proposed more fearsome designs to overcome it.

The social experimentation of the nineteenth century was only a preamble 
to the 
hyperimaginative technologies of the twentieth. World War I, in particular, 
strengthened immeasurably the links between jeopardy and renovation. 
Leaving 
behind a landscape of ruins, it prepared the future as a vast site for 
experimentation. Although World War I is generally described in terms of 
immobility--four long years of irresolution, the war of attrition in the 
trenches, the scarcities on the home front--it cannot be fully understood 
without 
taking account of its astonishing mobility: not simply the battles beneath 
the 
ocean and above the ground, not just the dramatic movements on the eastern 
front 
in 1917 and 1918, but the extraordinary mobilization of 
<B></B>
 industry, the 
dramatic rearrangements of the domestic balance of power, the carefully 
choreographed production of civilian morale, and, mostly, the disruption of 
millions of private lives. Again and again, witnesses recounted how the 
war and 
its rebellious aftermath were experienced in terms of extreme 
discontinuity. 
Literary accounts of the war, argues Samuel Hynes, were overwhelmingly 
"descriptive rather than narrative: like the war itself they do not move 
in any 
direction."

<p>
If any single event overturned accepted assumptions about the steady, 
accumulating course of history it was the Russian Revolution in 1917. In 
the two 
years that followed, revolutions broke out in Berlin, Vienna, and 
Budapest, and 
militant strikes pulled the shadow of revolution across the rest of 
Europe. At 
the same time, the influenza epidemic killed off more people than the ten 
million 
the war had and invited comparisons to the Plague. War, revolution, and 
plague 
all raised apocalyptic expectations about the end of time. So startling 
were the 
rapid-fire events of the years 1914-19 that the remembered past had little 
to 
offer in the way of guidance. History had truly become a delinquent. 
Derailed by 
war and revolution, it no longer seemed to run along the straight and 
predictable 
railway tracks of the nineteenth century. One historian took stock of the 
postwar 
years when he prefaced his 1934 
<I>History of Europe:</I>
 "Men wiser and 
more 
learned than I have discerned in history a plot, a rhythm, a predetermined 
pattern. These harmonies are concealed from me. I can see only one 
emergency 
following upon another as wave follows upon wave." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">

</SUP>
Military 
defeat, 
the end of the monarchy, and the unsteady political and economic fortunes 
of the 
Weimar Republic gave this general sense of disorientation a particularly 
sharp 
edge in Germany. 
<p>
However, the German experience of the present as catastrophic and of even 
the 
recent past as irretrievable was not simply the premise for nostalgia. In 
the 
years after the war, the aesthetic categories of modernism--shock, 
disruption, 
discontinuity, and transience--profoundly shaped the way intellectuals, 
artists, 
scientists, and politicians regarded time and approached the future. A 
remarkable 
consensus characterized Weimar culture: the twentieth century had 
invalidated the 
governing lines of development that had held until 1914; World War I, in 
particular, marked a major break, but did so not simply by destroying a 
familiar 
world, but by undermining conditions of stability altogether. Harsh 
economics, 
nearly continuous ideological warfare, and a pervasive culture of cynicism 
contributed to a postwar state of emergency that not only exerted a 
powerful 
aesthetic appeal by generating image after image of extreme "boundary" 
situations, but provided the necessary qualifications for unprecedented 
experimentation in postliberal design. Catastrophic thinking appeared to 
reopen 
the possibilities of history that the "routinized, bourgeois conduct of 
political 
life" had previously foreclosed. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">

</SUP>
The rough politics of the 
post-1918 years--the technocratic impulses of organized capitalism, the 
rise of 
fascism, the insurgency of communism, and the killing ground of 
Auschwitz--rested 
on the dizzying assumption that history was malleable and could be 
reworked and 
reshaped in hitherto unimagined ways. Again and again, German thinkers on 
the 
Left and the Right linked emergency with renewal, tradition and convention 
with 
decadence. 
<B></B>
<p>
What made post-1918 Germany so classically modern was the central role that 
catastrophe played in its cultural apprehensions and political 
perspectives. 
Germany was the "modernist nation par excellence of our century," writes 
Modris 
Eksteins in his important book, 
<I>The Rites of Spring,</I>
 because it was 
"starkly future-oriented." A flight forward would resolve the anxieties of 
the 
present. Even the war was fought to change rather than preserve the 
world. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">
34</A>
</SUP>
Three aspects of this apocalyptic vision stand out: 
the 
conviction that the grand narrative of "History" as it had developed over 
the 
course of the nineteenth century had been invalidated; the belief that 
these 
circumstances had been clarified by the extreme instability of private 
autobiographies and public institutions, particularly in the war; and the 
notion 
that this development and its recognition now permitted the wholesale 
renovation 
of the body of the nation. Characteristic postwar images of crippled 
veterans, 
unemployment lines, tumbledown metropolitan facades, and marauding armies 
all 
testified to the impermanence of the material world, but also to the 
tractability 
of its reconstruction. In other words, Germany stood outside "History," 
exposed 
to the anarchy of national and international politics, but also poised to 
reinvent itself. The future had never appeared so dangerous or so 
open-ended as 
when viewed from among the ruins of the postwar years. 
<p>
The prevalent feeling of discontinuity sustained a reckless politics 
manufactured 
to meet the challenges and opportunities that crisis seemed to imply. The 
formulation of Moeller van den Bruck, a conservative critic who was 
posthumously 
adopted by the Nazis, is apt. He repeatedly referred to the 
<I>"Revolutionsgewinn,"</I>
 the revolutionary yield, of the year 
1918. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">
35</A>
</SUP>
Catastrophe had given the Germans the latitude to 
gamble. 
After their capitulation on the western front and their humiliation at 
Versailles, the Germans had become a 
<I>"Gefahrvolk,"</I>
 a people of 
danger, 
better able to prosper in conditions of extreme danger than a "tired, 
matured" 
France or England, nations whose opportunities and revolutions had long 
since 
passed. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">

</SUP>
Here was the modernist subject par excellence. 
<p>
Much of the political and cultural thought of the postwar years revolved 
around 
tooling techniques of mobility by which Germany could reinvent history. The 
long-range bombers, high-powered lasers, and other military technologies 
that 
patriotic pulp-fiction writers invented to revise the Versailles 
settlement were 
only the most fantastic features of the wholly "altered world" 
<I>(ver&auml;nderte Welt)</I>
 that Ernst J&uuml;nger and others claimed 
modern-day technology had in fact fashioned. Technology introduced new 
levels of 
danger, wrecking the once unassailable certainties of the bourgeois epoch, 
but 
also equipping a new generation of uniformed and disciplined machine-men 
with 
unrivalled power. Danger and energy were the two sides of the 
twentieth-century 
manufacturing process that had literally stamped the planet with an 
unmistakable 
geometry.

contingency: architecture promised a regulative geometry, geopolitics

thinkers 
such as Ernst Bloch and Carl Schmitt groped for a new 
totality. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">

</SUP>
Nonetheless, the very premise on which these new social compacts were built 
introduced new dangers. The very delinquency of history had authorized the 
redemptive utopias of the machine-builders, architects, and eugenicists, 
but 
eventually it also withheld the crucial element of stability each sought. 
On the 
imaginary horizon, new technologies emerged to imperil the social order, 
emboldened enemies continued to mobilize along Germany's borders, the 
<I>Volk</I>
remained vulnerable to inherited pathologies. In this state of permanent 
emergency, renovation was a state of mind, a process rather than a 
destination. 
<p>
Renovation was the hallmark of National Socialism as well. The Nazis 
approached 
the twentieth century as a dangerous, unstable terrain that required 
relentless 
mobilization but also offered the Germans prospects for grandeur. This 
approach 
was obviously self-serving since the Third Reich used one emergency after 
the 
other to consolidate power. The extraordinary exertions it demanded, 
especially 
during the war, released the enormous social energy fueling the regime. To 
forego 
mobilization was to risk reviving the divisive quarrels of civil society 
and thus 
eroding the F&uuml;hrer's legitimacy. But the catastrophe of global war 
and the 
apocalyptic struggle the Nazis waged against Jews and other racial 
"enemies" were 
much more than ruses. Central to the Nazi worldview was the conviction that 
Germany was extremely vulnerable to biological deterioration. "He who 
leaves the 
plants in a garden to themselves," warned Walther Darr&eacute;, the future 
Nazi 
Minister of Agriculture, "will soon find to his surprise that the garden is 
overgrown by weeds." As a result, "questions of breeding" and social 
modeling in 
general had to be "at the center of all considerations." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">
43</A>
</SUP>
Unless the 
national destiny was forcefully managed, the parasitical influence of Jews 
and 
the disintegrative effects of democracy would proliferate. 
<p>
These emergency conditions of jeopardy created the conditions for 
renovation, 
however. If Germany embarked on far-reaching racial mobilization, it would 
be in 
a position to dominate the European continent. History was no guide, since 
the 
leaders of both Wilhelmine and Weimar Germany had failed to fashion an 
embracing 
<B></B>
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I>
 or introduce necessary 
social and hygienic reforms. 
Again and again, the insinuation of the extraordinary dangers of the 
present, the 
fabulous prospects for the future, and the ceaseless necessity for struggle 
developed a basically nonlinear view of history. What scholars have long 
recognized as apocalyptic features in the National Socialist worldview, 
which 
invalidated the predictable "story line" of historical development since 
1789 and 
postulated the commencement of "new time," rested on a thoroughly modernist 
sensitivity to the discontinuous punctuation of crisis and 
opportunity. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">

Although the Nazis referred frequently to 
eternal laws 
of history, they did so mainly to undermine the historical legitimacy of 
the 
Weimar Republic. It is highly significant that once in power the Nazis did 
not 
attempt to restore or preserve an authentic Germany. Instead, they sought 
to 
recast the nation in the newly fashioned mold of a high-performance racial 
society that encouraged social mobility in the name of national 
discipline. 
<p>
Not only the "blood and soil" vision of the Third Reich but also the 
anti-intellectual premises of the regime have been overstated. In the 
sciences, 
for example, technocratic impulses came to prevail. The so-called Aryan 
sciences 
were pushed to the margins as engineers, architects, and scientists 
mobilized to 
take advantage of the Nazis' "aggressive cult of feasibility." University 
research institutes, corporate laboratories, and military planners 
collaborated 
to fashion quite achievable "big science" projects. The unmistakable 
victory of 
the technocrats in the late 1930s underscored the spirit of renovation that 
prized improvisation, application, and practicality in difficult 
situations. 
Technocratic ideas thrived in this twilight zone of danger and 
possibility, the 
effects of which were only heightened by the conscripted labor, barbed 
wire, and 
utmost secrecy at sites like the Peenem&uuml;nde missile 
complex.

The struggle to renovate and arm the national

 was 
in no 
way incompatible with the spirit of modernism or the technocratic practice 
of 
scientists. Michael Burleigh's and Wolfgang Wippermann's insistence that 
modernism cannot possibly be racist is entirely unconvincing.

<p>
To be sure, there was a long 
<I>v&ouml;lkisch</I>
 pedigree to Nazi racism. 
The 
rise of biological anti-Semitism at the end of the nineteenth century, the 
eugenic utopias of Alfred Ploetz, Willibald Hentschel, and Walther 
Darr&eacute;, 
and Germany's long-standing imperial ambitions in eastern Europe indicate 
that 
the Nazis were not original thinkers. Nonetheless, the project of racial 
construction they pursued had few precedents. In the name of racial 
hygiene, the 
Third Reich segregated Germans into categories based on "worth" and 
"value," 
embarked on far-reaching eugenics programs to "weed out" undesirables, and 
made 
provisions for a social-welfare administration to nurture and improve the 
health 
of the majority. Moreover, the Nazis mobilized in the name of a distant 
"Thousand-Year Reich," the foundations for which required relentless 
reform. In 
their view, struggle did not eliminate, but only contained the marauding 
movements of history, so that Germans had to prepare vigilantly for war as 
much 
as they had to cultivate their genes. At every step, successful conquest 
provided 
the precondition for further mobilization. In the 
<I>Generalplan Ost</I>
(the 
General Plan for the East), for example, occupied Poland and parts of the 
Soviet 
Union became the vast 
<B></B>
 site of an envisaged 
<I>Neureich,</I>
 a modern 
empire planned according to exact demographic, economic, and urban 
requirements 
in order to renovate the 
<I>Altreich,</I>
 pre-1938 Germany.

The 
destruction of one half of European Jewry is stark testimony to the degree 
to 
which visions of a Germanic 
<I>Neureich</I>
 were implemented. 
<p>
The Nazis saw the world as a totally mobilized, pitiless landscape. The 
catastrophes of recent history had wrecked the edifices of the liberal age 
and 
exposed Germany to the predations of the Allies, the insurgency of the 
Bolsheviks, and, most dangerous of all, the prospect of biological 
deterioration. 
At the same time, however, the Nazis presupposed the ability to renovate 
the 
world. Grand imperial designs and well-ordered racial hierarchies would 
lay the 
foundations for previously unimagined German prosperity. The surprising 
contingencies of history had conred both the unpredictable terrain of 
danger 
and the very tractable zone of design. The features of modernism described 
both 
places. Defining itself in the machine-age terms of crisis and renovation, 
National Socialism constructed a totalitarian version of the modern. The 
Third 
Reich is, as Zygmunt Bauman concluded of the Holocaust, "a rare, yet 
significant 
and reliable, test of the hidden possibilities of modern 
society."

There is perhaps no artifact of the "Nazi Modern" better suited for 
inclusion in 
the museum of the twentieth century than the gas mask, a tool that 
acknowledges 
the extreme jeopardy of the moment, but holds out the possibility of 
survival as 
long as the wearer enrolls in a stern regimen of uniformity and 
discipline, ready 
for relentless onslaughts and murderous counterattacks.

In 
the end, 
as we know, the regime self-destructed. The total mobilization Nazism 
envisaged 
is no longer a credible response to the perils and possibilities of the 
twentieth 
century. Hopefully, we live more easily with indeterminacy and understand 
more 
clearly the costs of managing contingency. Nonetheless, the complicity of 
Nazism 
in the premises of modernism is haunting.

This is drawn from Marshall Berman, who defines "modernism as any 
attempt by 
modern men and women to become subjects as well as objects of 
modernization, to 
get a grip on the modern world and make themselves at home in it" (Marshall 
Berman, 
<I>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity</I>
 [New 
York: Simon and Schuster, 1982], 5). But, in my view, the circumstances of 
danger 
and the possibly illiberal outcomes of these efforts are not sufficiently 
emphasized by Berman. For a better sense of the range of modernisms, see 
Russell 
Berman,

The importance of ambivalence and ambiguity has been stressed by 
Zygmunt 
Bauman, although he sees the elimination of ambivalence rather than its 
acknowledgment as typically modern (see Zygmunt Bauman, 
<I>Modernity and Ambivalence</I>
 [Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University Press, 1991]). Several 
excellent cultural histories explore the ways in which modernists question 
the 
epistemological status of vision, demystify "common sense," and seek to 
problematize perception, but hardly appreciate how this postliberal survey 
might 
rearm the political imagination. See, for example, Peter B&uuml;rger,
