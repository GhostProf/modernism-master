<p>
Anyone embarking on a study of scholarship in the Third Reich may
encounter any
combination of strange bedfellows, as a recent event called to our
attention. In
June 1995, <I>The New York Times </I>reported a story about a prominent
German
professor of literature who had assumed a false identity in order not
to be
linked with his past associations with the SS. The branch to which he
belonged,
the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> (Ancestral Heritage), was a research department
that
enlisted scholars from a variety of fields to investigate the Germanic
race in
all of its manifestations. The scholar, Hans Schwerter, alias Hans-Ernst
Schneider, faces accusations that he was responsible for supplying medical
equipment to be used for experiments on human subjects interned in
concentration
camps. The eighty-five-year-old professor emeritus and former rector
of the
Technical College in Aachen concedes that he changed his identity, but
insists
that his work with the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> focused mainly on folk
dances.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
The Ancestral Heritage branch of the SS has been known to historians for
well
over twenty years through Michael Kater's painstaking reconstruction
of its
history and function in the Nazi state.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
To the casual reader
of
<I>The New York Times,</I> however, the fact that the SS could
simultaneously
serve as the headquarters for organized mass murder and a research center
for
folk music poses a disturbing juxtaposition, and Schneider/ Schwerter's
explanation of his activities implies that we are to regard the two
activities of
the SS as mutually exclusive. A person who could immerse himself in the
harmless
and esoteric world of folk music could not possibly have any interest in
dehumanization, torture, and extermination. But 

<B></B>

cases of the harmless
coexisting
with the harmful, or of cultivation in an atmosphere of destruction,
complete the
list of Third Reich idiosyncrasies that range from individual
personalities to
entire organizations. We are allowed occasional glimpses of the elusive
personality of Hitler as a vegetarian and an avid dog lover, while the
quaint,
manicured flower gardens gracing the headquarters at Auschwitz are
maintained to
this day to drive home the irony of their presence.

<p>
The gross incongruities of the simultaneous cultivation of beauty,
art, and
knowledge alongside cruelty, destruction, and indoctrination spread into
the
realm of music, one of the most prized cultural treasures of Germany, and
music
scholarship, a discipline in which German scholars had played a leading
role from
the very beginning. Music had come to be regarded as central to defining
the
German nation in the era leading up to unification in 1871, preoccupying
philosophers and novelists, and persisting as a key component in
developing a
national identity, especially after the defeat in World War
I.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The
music policy of the Nazi government further promoted art music as
Germany's
cultural showpiece and cultivated amateur music and music education as a
central
daily activity, taking more care than its forerunners to sustain
orchestras,
opera houses, and choral and chamber groups in every town, great and
small, and
even rescuing private and semiprivate musical operations such as the
Bayreuth
Festival and the Berlin Philharmonic from total ruin by making them wards
of the
state.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But these measures were not without their own
ironies: while
stripping Jewish citizens of all rights and possessions, the government
also made
sure that the Jews had their own outlet for musical expression in the
Jewish
Culture League (J&uuml;discher Kulturbund), which allowed Jewish-staffed
theater
and opera companies, symphony orchestras, cabaret, and numerous choral and
chamber music groups to perform Jewish works to Jewish audiences from 1933
to
1941.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Even in the concentration camps, bands and orchestras
made up
of inmates were vigilantly maintained in at least twenty locations, called
upon
to entertain SS officers stationed there and to drown out the sounds of
torture.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Music scholarship also received unprecedented state support after Hitler
came to
power, despite the reputed anti-intellectual foundations of Nazi ideology
and
policy, and also became an accomplice to acts of racism and exploitation.
Musicology had been in many ways a "German discipline," with
German-speaking
scholars at the forefront of methodological and organizational
developments,
initiating large-scale research projects, periodicals, and publication
series.
The Nazi state and party invested much time and money into building up
research
facilities and employing musicologists, especially in capacities outside
the
university. In addition to <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> support for research, the
education ministry revived a dying musicological institute in
B&uuml;ckeburg and
expanded and reestablished it in Berlin as the State Institute for German
Music
Research (Staatliches Institut f&uuml;r deutsche Musikforschung); the
propaganda
ministry funded musicological projects and employed musicologists as
consultants,
and the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) relied on
musicologists'
collaboration for its education and recreational programs, such as the
"Strength
through Joy" program (NS-Gemeinschaft Kraft 

<B></B>

 durch
Freude). At the same time
Alfred Rosenberg, in his watch-dog function as "Deputy to the F&uuml;hrer
for the
Supervision of the Total Intellectual and Ideological Training and
Education of
the National Socialist German Workers' Party," enlisted a small army of
music
scholars to evaluate each others' works, to compile ideologically sound
music
reference works (such as the <I>Lexikon der Juden in der Musik</I>
[Lexicon of
Jews in Music], a practical guide for hunting down Jews active in musical
life),
and to assist in the plundering of Jewish homes and libraries in occupied
regions.

<p>
Why should this regime, whose primary goals were military expansion,
industrial
and technological growth, control of public opinion, and racial
purification, be
so interested in investing in a small, esoteric humanities discipline such
as
musicology? That the Nazi state paid more attention to musicology than
prior
regimes might be explained with the same reasons for its investment in
music
performance: to present a high level of cultural achievement before the
critical
eye of the outside world. But musicology was still a relatively new field.
It
lacked influence in universities and among the music public, and it was of
little
apparent use to the practical needs of the Nazi state. Why did the state
and
party nevertheless continue to channel resources into detailed research on
folk
music and music history, even at the height of a costly war?

<p>
This issue brings us face to face with the fundamental paradox that has
made the
Third Reich phenomenon so difficult to penetrate: how do you rationalize
the
enviable history of Germany as a bastion of intellectual and artistic
achievement
with the barbarities of the darkest chapter in its history? It is a
contradiction
that has let so many confrontations with this period lapse into
emotionally
charged condemnation, on the one hand, and defensiveness, on the other.
The fact
remains that the Nazi regime allowed the best and the worst of German
society to
coexist, even within the same organization, and the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I>
illustrates one such harmonious relationship between the most notorious
perpetrators of racial prejudice and genocide and some of the most
privileged
heirs to the noble German intellectual tradition. The success of this
relationship can be explained only by a complex and deeply-rooted
interdependence
that touches on pragmatism, mutual exploitation, and common long-term
goals.

1. Music, Musicology, and Politics in Germany after World War I
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The Nazi government has earned the reputation of an anti-intellectual
regime, but
most university professionals would have argued that anti-intellectualism
was the
property of the Weimar Republic. The growing industry-based economy
spearheaded
by Bismarck was already threatening to diminish the importance of
intellectuals
as the bearers of culture, and the establishment of the Republic in 1918
was
perceived as a direct affront to the university, an institution based
on an
inherently antidemocratic power structure that concentrated decision
making in
the hands of a few professors.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The majority of the academic
elite
resisted change and accepted the Republic, if at all, only out of
necessity.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Weimar government's attempts at 

<B></B>

 reforms in
higher
education were met with vehement disapproval: when the Prussian
Minister of
Culture C. H. Becker, overseeing more than half of the universities in the
Reich,
tried to reform the curriculum by suggesting remedies for
overspecialization and
alienation from the needs of the public, he piqued the anger of professors
who
accused him of promoting marxism, materialism, and positivism, and seeking
to
undermine German <I>Kultur.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
Yet musicologists did not fit neatly into the mold of the conservative,
antidemocratic Weimar professor. Musicology was still relatively new
to the
university and was eyed with some mistrust by other academics. The
function of
the musicologist was also somewhat loosely defined, with trained
musicologists
finding homes in the university, the conservatory, and journalism. And
because
the musicology professor was a direct descendent of the practicing music
director
rather than the music theorists of the Middle Ages, musicology's status in
the
university remained ambiguous well into the first decades of the twentieth
century.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Relative novelty and lack of professional definition
explain why many of the pioneer scholars failed to rise in the university
ranks;
why music criticism, as had long been the case, continued to supplement
the
income of even the most famous university professors; and why professors
of
musicology could still be practicing musicians and composers without
lowering
themselves in the eyes of their colleagues. More important, it also
explains why
musicologists were more flexible in listening to and acting on the demands
of the
Weimar state to meet the needs of the public, in contrast to the
reactionary
response of the majority of university professors in older, more firmly
entrenched disciplines.

<p>
The musicology community, seeing employment options shrink as veterans
returned
from the front and the German economy weakened, gave serious thought
to the
general call to emerge from the ivory tower.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
They aired their
concerns about the relevance of their work in the popular press and a
growing
number of nonacademic specialized journals.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Some highlighted
musicology's educational function of making the common music lover an
educated
listener and offered direct suggestions for music education
policies.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Others recommended that the government pursue
programs to
make use of the trained musicologist's qualifications: programs to
cultivate folk
music, organize public concerts in urban centers and smaller towns and
villages,
and provide lectures and workshops in music appreciation.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
The musical needs of Weimar Germany were also changing. Military
defeat and
modernization had intensified longing for lost national pride and
nostalgia for
simpler times. Rising tensions among social and political factions
inspired many
to search for ways to bring Germans together: music was widely promoted as
holding the key to healing the wounds of a split society and promoting
feelings
of camaraderie. Amateur organizations such as the German Federation of
Workers'
Choral Societies (Deutsche Arbeiter S&auml;ngerbund) were already
demonstrating
that choral singing could bring people of all social classes together in a
class-blind communal activity.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The Youth Movement
(Jugendbewegung)
made music making one of its central activities, and music education rose
to
prominence on the government's agenda and enjoyed sweeping reforms in the
1920s.
Indeed, by 1931 choral groups could account for the participation 

<B></B>

 of
perhaps two
million German citizens, and the membership in these groups ignored
political and
social boundaries. A proliferation of instrumental music making in and
outside
the home suggests the degree to which music had become part of the daily
German
fare.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
In response, musicologists began to take a great
interest in
amateur music making, an interest that was to continue beyond 1933. The
rapidly
growing Youth Music Movement (Jugendmusikbewegung) and the revival of
private
music making <I>(Hausmusik)</I> held a special attraction for
musicologists.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
They encouraged the performance of early
music and
stimulated demand for early music and folk music editions.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
This postwar upsurge of musical activity further reinforced the Germans'
reputation as <I>the</I> musical nation, the <I>Volk der Musik,</I> and
focused
more attention on the questions of what made the Germans so musical and
what made
German music "German." Music lovers and musicologists increasingly turned
their
attention to the history and nature of German music, partly in response to
the
public need to understand and reaffirm the identity of Germany as a
nation, and
partly out of the isolation caused by the war that cut scholars off from
international contacts. Wartime travel restrictions had forced music
researchers
to become acquainted with their own musical resources and to focus
on local
studies out of economic necessity, and the postwar resentment among
colleagues in
former enemy countries fueled feelings of nationalist
isolation.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The founders of major scholarly institutions and periodicals emerging
immediately
after the war adopted a mission of promoting German scholars and work on
German
topics, and the record of publications clearly indicates an ever
increasing
engagement with German music from 1918 to 1945, at least in quantitative
terms.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Musicology's focus on German music history accompanied an avid interest in
German
folk music. Folk music had long been regarded as a symbol of German
national
identity and unity, and a serious interest in German folk music continued
to be
one of the most powerful signals that musicology could serve the needs of
the
German nation. The nineteenth-century glorification of folk culture had
developed
into a large-scale effort to collect and preserve folk music, and the
fruits of
these labors, housed in archives in Freiburg and Berlin, offered
musicologists a
potential source for uncovering the mysteries of German musical strength.
It was
assumed that folk music, unlike art music, was pure and sheltered from
foreign
influences, especially among the populations of isolated ethnic-German
enclaves
<I>(Auslandsdeutschtum),</I> who had to struggle to preserve their German
folk
culture. Scholars worked on the now discredited assumption that folk music
was
stagnant and therefore could represent the closest approximation to some
sort of
"ur-German" music.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
II. Musicology and the New Regime
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
By the time Hitler came to power, German musicologists had already
demonstrated
their willingness to use their skills for the needs of the nation, both
practical
and ideological. 

<B></B>

 Immediately thereafter, the
musicological establishment
made
political gestures to indicate its willingness to work together with the
regime.
In July 1933 the German Music Society (Deutsche Musikgesellschaft), the
scholarly
society for musicologists, dismissed the Jewish editor of its journal,
officially
dissolved itself, and reorganized under the name of Deutsche Gesellschaft
f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft (German Society for Musicology) with a charter
based
on the National Socialist leadership principle (F&uuml;hrerprinzip). It
then
offered its services to the state in a letter to the propaganda minister.
It
later held its first conference in the new Reich at the large music
festival in
D&uuml;sseldorf, the 1938 Reich Music Days (Reichsmusiktage), also home of
the
notorious exhibit <I>Degenerate Music</I> (Entartete Musik) that vilified
alleged
Jewish influences in popular and art music. The meeting's central
theme was
"Music and Race," the title of one session and of the keynote speech by
Kiel
professor Friedrich Blume. The other sessions centered on popular research
areas
that were becoming central to musicological scholarship and were deemed
important
for the needs of the state: "German Music," "German Masters," "State and
Music,"
"Questions for Music Research."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The Nazi government, for its part, showed more concern than its
forerunners had
for the future of musicology. The government had adopted a policy of
making room
for the next generation (Nachwuchsf&ouml;rderung, or promotion of
progeny),
encouraging and sometimes forcing older scholars to retire from university
posts,
and the younger generation responded enthusiastically in the first few
years by
pledging to commit their work to the service of the German <I>Volk</I> and
the
Nazi state.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The propaganda ministry and other branches of the
government and party offered a surprising amount of support to
musicologists,
especially when their work contributed toward understanding the German
musical
heritage or cultivating German music in the public arena. They even made
provisions for employing some of the overflow of trained musicologists
with
specially created nonacademic posts.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
A separate music
department in
the propaganda ministry sponsored or cosponsored a number of musicological
publishing projects: editions of the complete works of Gl&uuml;ck and
Bruckner, a
multivolume collection of German folk songs, and a collection of essays by
musicologists who used historical evidence to demonstrate Germany's
presence in
the musical culture of countries annexed or under occupation by
1944.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The propaganda ministry enlisted other musicologists as
part-time consultants,
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
and one well-known scholar, Hans
Joachim
Moser, managed to secure a full-time position in the propaganda ministry
with the
creation of the Reich Department for Musical Arrangements (Reichsstelle
f&uuml;r
Musikbearbeitungen), established to furnish the repertoire of opera houses
and
concert halls with "acceptable" works.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
The state's grandest gesture of support for musicology was the
resurrection of
the all-but-defunct Royal Institute for German Music Research
(F&uuml;rstliches
Institut f&uuml;r deutsche Musikforschung) in B&uuml;ckeburg. The Nazi
education
minister moved the dying institute to Berlin in 1935, adding on the Berlin
folk
music archive, the renowned music instrument collection, a number of
editing
projects and periodicals, and a new department for folk-music research.
The Nazi
party also had its uses for 

<B></B>

 musicologists' skills,
as in the tasks
performed for
Alfred Rosenberg's watchdog organization for spotting ideological
transgressions.
The Rosenberg Bureau (Amt Rosenberg) had its own music department, which
supported a small number of research and publishing projects and enlisted
dozens
of musicologists for evaluating works for ideological propriety, supplying
data
to complete its <I>Lexicon of Jews in Music,</I> and contributing to the
Nazi
party's planned elite Party University (Hohe Schule der
Partei).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Rosenberg's wartime operational staff carried out a mission to seize
valuable
property in occupied territories under the premise of supplying the
library of
the Party University as well as state libraries and museums, and had a
special
musical staff (Sonderstab Musik) that engaged musicologists to assess the
value
of seized items for their potential use for musicological research,
sending
scholars to Poland, Belgium, France, Holland, and the Baltic
states.
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

III. The <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> and Music Research
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The SS, in addition to carrying out police terror and the ruthlessly
efficient
operation of death camps, was a highly complex mass organization.
Historians have
called it the "SS state," noting its size, complexity, and status as a
state
within the state, immune to the legal and judicial system of the Reich,
free to
impose its own physical, mental, and ideological standards for its elite
members,
to run its own military units, and to develop its own science, education,
culture, and rituals.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The research unit known as the
<I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> grew out of Himmler's own intellectual aspirations. He
had
long fancied himself a historian and took a keen interest in furthering a
general
knowledge of Germanic prehistory. Sharing these goals was Richard Walther
Darr&eacute;, the architect of the "blood and soil" mythology and agrarian
policies of the Nazi party and head of the SS Headquarters for Race and
Resettlement (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt/RuSHA); the two supported the
amateur
historian Hermann Wirth in the formation of the <I>Deutsches Ahnenerbe</I>
in
1935. This was to be a "scientific" society dedicated to studying the
history of
the Germanic race, attached to Darr&eacute;'s RuSHA and funded largely by
his
agricultural office.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Himmler eventually pushed out these
cofounders
and absorbed the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> into his personal staff, making himself
head
with limitless powers. He surrounded himself with reputable scholars to
run the
scientific side of the organization and hired a dedicated assistant,
Wolfram
Sievers, to oversee administrative matters.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
The
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
strove to be a quintessentially interdisciplinary undertaking, involving
natural
sciences, social sciences, and humanities disciplines in a collaborative
setting
to achieve a complete understanding of the Germanic race.

<p>
These grand designs of accumulating a comprehensive knowledge of the
Germanic
race extended into forming a broad conception of "Germanic" music, and
musicologists who could demonstrate the appropriate interests were in an
especially favorable position to receive financial backing from Himmler's
coffers. Such interests included reconstructing the music of prehistoric
Germanic
tribes, seeking out the essence of German music in both folk and art
repertoires,
or determining 

<B></B>

 Germanic influences in presumably
non-Germanic musical
sources
such as Gregorian chant. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I> funded research projects,
facilitated travel abroad, subsidized book publications, and solicited
musicological contributions for its in-house journals. Fritz Bose,
a young,
ambitious scholar who cultivated a long-term relationship with the SS in
the
hopes of establishing a position within the organization, took on a wide
variety
of assignments, all in some way related to the musicological goals of the
organization. Bose's first project consisted of a research trip to Finland
in the
summer of 1936 to evaluate folk music materials. When he reported that
their
value for understanding prehistoric Nordic culture could be assessed only
through
comparative studies with the folk music of such regions as Iceland and the
Faroe
Islands, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> contacted Wilhelm Heinitz for copies of his
recordings of folk music from the Faroe Islands, a part of its larger goal
to
collect examples from the entire spectrum of German folk
music.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Bose was also assigned to conduct research on the lur, a bronze-age
instrument
always found in pairs and so presumed to provide early evidence for the
origins
of polyphony. In scholarly and popular literature, the lur had become
symbolic of
the cultural advances of Germanic tribes, and in 1932 the influential
amateur
musicologist Richard Eichenauer concluded on the basis of such speculation
that
consonance and the triad must be Germanic inventions.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
From
then on,
the instrument represented proof of a Germanic racial trait dictating a
preference for consonance and an inborn aversion to "Jewish
atonalism."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> entrusted Bose with the
task of
researching and reproducing models of the instrument. After commissioning
a
reproduction of the instrument, Bose went on to refute claims that the lur
was
not used as a musical instrument or that it was fashioned after an
oriental
prototype.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Other musicologists profited from <I>Ahnenerbe</I> publishing outlets. In
its
first years leading up to the war, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> had established
three
journals (the monthly <I>Germanien, </I>and two journals dedicated to
genealogy,
<I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Namen-forschung</I> and <I>Das Sippenzeichen),</I>
its
own publishing house in Berlin-Dahlem, and a publication series of
monographs in
the humanities, and was coproducing several highly-respected scholarly
periodicals. After a rejection from the music publisher B&auml;renreiter,
Joseph
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, head of the musicology department in Freiburg,
presented his
book <I>Germanisches Erbe in deutscher Tonkunst</I> (Germanic Heritage in
Musical
Compositions) to the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> and won acceptance into its
publication
series.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The study uses examples of folk music, lullabies, and
children's songs to reconstruct Germanic prehistoric music and to derive
melodic
gestures that can be found throughout German art music. Himmler even
personally
requested that M&uuml;ller-Blattau be persuaded to work for the
organization, but
the discovery of his pre-1933 connections to Jews, democrats, and
communists, his
support of atonality and psychological methods, and his reputation as a
political
chameleon seem to have worked against him.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
The scholar who enjoyed the most publishing opportunities from the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> was Hans Joachim Moser. From 1938 through 1940 he was a
regular
contributor to 

<B></B>

 the periodical <I>Germanien,</I>
edited by folklorist
Joseph Otto
Pla&szlig;mann. Moser supplied articles on the history of military music,
folk
songs, fundamental elements of German music, and the music of lands
recently
annexed or occupied by German troops.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
He was skillful in
quickly
furnishing contributions that would reinforce Germany's military advances
with
historical evidence of early German musical presence in these regions. In
September 1938, the same month as the Munich agreement, Moser offered to
write an
article on Sudeten-German music history, and by October 1939, one month
after the
invasion of Poland, Moser had submitted a similar article on
Danzig.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Two of Moser's <I>Germanien</I> articles, the
Sudeten-German essay and another that praised the events of the
<I>Anschluss</I>
with Austria, were reprinted in the special <I>Ahnenerbe</I> publication
celebrating the "homecoming" of Austria and the Sudetenland back into the
German
Reich.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Then, in the spring of 1939, after beginning to write
a
series of articles on the history of German military songs, Moser took
note of
the rapid increase in military gains and asked the editor Pla&szlig;mann
"would<I> you rather have in the meantime a more politically topical essay
on the
Flemish-Dutch-German musical connection?</I> Also one on the musical
<I>culture-bridge</I> to Scandinavia would certainly be feasible" (italics
in
original).
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
His letter was written shortly after the
occupation of
Denmark in April 1940 and preceded the offensive on Belgium and Holland by
five
days.

<p>
After the war was in full force, musicological undertakings sponsored by
the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> focused more on the immediate tasks of gathering
information in
territories outside the Reich, where the SS could exercise its special
privileges. Only months after the outbreak of the war, Himmler used his
position
as Reich Commissioner for Securing German Nationhood (Reichskommissar
f&uuml;r
die Festigung deutschen Volkstums/RFK) to assume control over the seizure
of
arable land, and in December 1939 he extended this jurisdiction to the
seizure of
cultural property. <I>Ahnenerbe</I> actions thereafter concentrated on
"securing," i.e. seizing, cultural property (a direct violation of the
Hague
Convention) from Poland, Russia, South Tyrol, and parts of Yugoslavia
which
supposedly bore relevance for the study of the Germanic race, and setting
up
facilities for imposing German culture on the "Germanic" countries under
occupation (Norway, Holland, Denmark, Belgium). The <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
intensified
its activities in the humanities more than in the natural sciences
in these
years, and, owing to the special status of the SS, many of its researchers
could
carry out their work in some form or another during the war and avoid
military
service by virtue of Himmler's consecrating their activities as "war
essential"
<I>(kriegswichtig; DAS,</I> 145).

<p>
Most of the music-related wartime projects of the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I>
concentrated on folk-music research rather than the acquisition of
valuable
artifacts. While most other <I>Ahnenerbe</I> wartime initiatives
concentrated on
seizing, assessing, and transporting "Germanic" property into Germany,
musicologists tended toward a more literal execution of "preservation" of
the
"Germanic" heritage, concentrating on recording and transcribing the folk
music
of the surviving ethnic German communities rather than seizing physical
property.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Even while some SS officers took the 

<B></B>

 trouble to
assess
property for its potential value to music scholarship, most of the
activity of
musicologists themselves focused on field research.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
Although the war caused the termination of Bose's work in Finland, German
military advances opened up research opportunities on other fronts, and
the plans
to transfer populations created a pressing need to document the folk music
of
ethnic Germans selected for resettlement.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
The initial
suggestion
for an aggressive campaign to collect folk music from ethnic Germans came
from
the musicologists themselves. Already in February 1940, Fritz Bose
was ever
vigilant of new opportunities and, within days of the termination of his
Finland
research, he wrote to Sievers with suggestions for extending the
definition of
"cultural property" to the performance realm, i.e. recording folk music
and folk
dances of Volhynian and Baltic ethnic Germans in resettlement camps,
and of
ethnic Germans in former Poland, Galicia, the Carpathian mountains, and
South
Tyrol. Bose recommended that the project be carried out as soon as
possible,
before resettlement disrupted the lives of the subjects; that it
become the
domain of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> rather than a university, where it might be
neglected; and that he be entrusted with the supervision of the
project.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
But another musicologist, Alfred Quellmalz, had
applied to
the Ethnic German Liaison Office (Volksdeutsche Mittlestelle) ten days
before the
date of Bose's letter and, in early March, was able to carry out a similar
project in the resettlement camps of the Volhynian and Galician
Germans.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
The involvement of Quellmalz in SS-work led to the most extensive
musicological
projects under the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> Quellmalz was head of the folk music
department in the State Institute for German Music Research. By employing
him
full time, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> forged a mutually beneficial collaboration
with
the institute and could make full use of its resources. Immediately after
the
completion of the Volhynian-Galician project, Quellmalz embarked on what
was to
become the largest musicological venture supported by the
<I>Ahnenerbe:</I> the
collection of folk materials from the ethnic Germans in South Tyrol.
Following a
1939 agreement between Germany and Italy, the German-speaking inhabitants
of
South Tyrol were given the option to resettle in the German Reich. After
an
overwhelming majority voted in favor of resettlement, Himmler supervised
the
transfer and used his position to benefit the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> His
"cultural
commission" set about zealously to photograph, transcribe, or otherwise
document
all cultural property that the Italians would not let out of the country
because
it was not in the private possession of the settlers. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
worked
so assiduously in documenting Italian possessions that they felt it unwise
to let
the Italian officials know of the extent of their work.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
In the end, the recording and transcribing of folk music in South Tyrol
lasted
from June 1940 until December 1942. By that time, Quellmalz's staff
grew to
include eight collaborators working on folk songs, instrumental music,
folk
dances, children's songs and games, and music history. They scoured the
entire
South Tyrolean countryside, making sound recordings of vocal and
instrumental
music, photocopies of manuscripts and printed songbooks, transcriptions,
and
silent films of folk dances, games, plays, and instrumental techniques, as
well
as photographing their subjects 

<B></B>

 and collecting
their biographical data in
order
to learn more about their racial and sociological
composition.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
The gains for historical musicology from the South Tyrol project were
significant
as well, yielding the discovery of a wide range of valuable sources in
Italian
archives. The wealth of available material compelled Quellmalz to request
that
the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> engage another assistant to document these historical
sources. This information would benefit Quellmalz personally, aiding him
in the
research for his own postdoctoral thesis (the <I>Habilitationsschrift,</I>
required of assistant professors for promotion), and allowing him to widen
his
own sphere of influence into chant research and to gain the services of
another
assistant working exclusively on that area.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
Himmler was reputed to have a special interest in Gregorian chant
research, and
musicologists used that knowledge to try to secure support from the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> for chant projects, particularly if they could use this
research
to determine Germanic influences. Karl Gustav Fellerer had already pursued
that
direction in his <I>Deutsche Gregorianik im Frankenreich</I> (German Chant
in the
Frankish Empire) and his continuing research into the German elements in
Gregorian chant in Holland and Flanders; and Ewald Jammers had completed a
similar study, <I>Die v&ouml;lkische Zugeh&ouml;rigkeit des
gregorianischen
Chorals</I> (National Correlation in Gregorian Chant). Quellmalz went to
great
lengths to try to secure the publication of Jammers's book, intended for a
series
edited by Friedrich Blume entitled <I>Schriften zur musikalischen Volks-
und
Rassenkunde</I> (Publications on Musical Nationality and Race Studies),
but held
up by paper shortages. He sought the intervention of the SS Central
Security
Office (Sicherheitshauptamt) and the cosponsorship of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
to
push the project through, all under the premise of Himmler's special
concern for
Gregorian chant.

IV. A Pragmatic Working Relationship
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The seemingly mismatched collaboration between musicologists and Himmler's
SS
operations begins to make sense when we consider some of the practical
potential
gains for each side. From the perspective of musicologists, the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
offered several attractive opportunities. As a source of research funding,
it
held many advantages over more conventional sources, since the SS had a
special
status and could circumvent visa and currency complications often
encountered by
scholars applying for research trips abroad.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Furthermore, in
terms
of research areas, musicologists were not so restricted as one might
think. Such
were the experiences of musicologist Johann Schottl&auml;nder, who
successfully
appealed to Himmler for travel money for research on ancient Greek
notation in
Greece, Switzerland, and Italy after the German Research Council (Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft) turned him down, believing his plans to be too
ambitious.
The SS was willing not only to fund his research, but also to consider
publishing
his results as part of an <I>Ahnenerbe</I> series.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>
Younger scholars had lived through a difficult period of underemployment
and seen the first signs of a turnaround with the stated policy of
<I>Nachwuchsf&ouml;rderung</I> 

<B></B>

 and the removal of
the small number of Jews
who
occupied academic posts. For them, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was a way of
procuring
research support, enhancing their publication records, and ultimately
linking up
with a powerful political influence that could lead to university
employment.
Fritz Bose, for example, recognized the power of the SS, and tried to
harness it
toward his advancement. He asked to be employed officially by the SS, but
made it
clear that he wanted to preserve his university ties by continuing to
perform his
functions at the Berlin acoustics institute on a voluntary basis, to give
lectures, to proceed with his <I>Habilitation,</I> "and--if it please the
gods--some day to become a real professor."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
During the war, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was especially attractive for the
special
privileges the SS offered those under its protection. Scholars could avail
themselves of research sources in politically volatile regions
inaccessible to
other researchers, and in some cases they could continue working in their
chosen
field while being exempted from military service. Quellmalz justified his
prolonged absence from the State Institute to the education ministry by
explaining that this was a unique opportunity to collect material and
study the
culture of a previously inaccessible German enclave, and that the RFK had
arranged for his release from military service to continue with the
work.
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Erich Schenk, head of the musicology department in
Vienna,
saw an opportunity to exploit the SS presence in Italy and proposed a
collaboration between his department (along with its existing research
center in
Florence) and the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> to investigate "Germanic remnants" in
Italian
music from the sixth century to the sixteenth century.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Even
though
his main research interests and that of his Florence center were the
origins of
the classical style, he framed his proposal in terms that would appeal to
Himmler's Germanic interests. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was initially
interested,
owing to Himmler's "special interest in questions of Gregorian chant," but
realized that Schenk wanted only to forge a relationship with the SS to
take
advantage of its political influence in Italy.
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
From the SS perspective, musicology was important because it promised to
realize
the SS desire for comprehensiveness. The interest in musicology, in other
words,
was probably part of a grander scheme to amass total control over German
intellectual life, competing with the education ministry, the propaganda
ministry, and especially the Rosenberg Bureau. Although prior
investigations into
the goals of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> do not explore the musicology connection
in
detail, many of their conclusions can apply to musicology. Anke Oesterle,
relying
largely on Kater's work, looked specifically at the relationship between
the SS
and folklorists to conclude that a prime motivation for SS interest in the
humanities was sheer competition with Rosenberg for greater spheres of
influence
and intellectual prestige. In the course of a few years, the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
gave the appearance of being more flexible and allowing for more
intellectual
freedom (particularly after Himmler placed its direction in the hands of a
renowned scholar, Walter W&uuml;st) in order to attract as many reputable
scholars as possible.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Yet a mere desire for total control fails to account fully for the
SS-musicology
bond, particularly when we compare musicologists' activities with those of
other 

<B></B>

humanities scholars in the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> According to the list of its
objectives in occupied areas and in northern Italy, the SS generally
sought not
only to plunder but also to establish a working relationship with
indigenous
populations, carrying out the "cultural-political" tasks of fostering
cooperation
and "educating" ethnic German natives to the National Socialist worldview.
But
Oesterle's analysis of folklorists indicates that they ignored the
"cultural-political" part of their assignment and concentrated on
acquiring
material objects. Folklorists, in short, used their work in South Tyrol to
rationalize their greed for Italian cultural property with alleged
scholarly
pursuits.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>

<p>
Musicologists, by contrast, showed themselves to be far more serious about
the
"cultural-political" tasks of the venture. Their South Tyrolean campaign
involved
the feverish collection and documentation of melodies and folk practices.
Musicologists came into close contact with the natives and exploited their
presence to spread the gospel of Germanization to the South Tyroleans.
Quellmalz
and Bose lectured on folk music to capacity crowds throughout the region,
another
staff member led folk dancing courses, and the entire group ran a
week-long
folk-music retreat in the summer of 1941. It was by virtue of the
"national-political" <I>(volkspolitisch)</I> importance of these
tasks that
Quellmalz was relieved of some of his military service, with the
understanding
that he could be called upon at any time to carry out SS assignments of
"cultural
propaganda" in the occupied territories.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
For the SS,
musicologists
were more than just diligent scholars who could broaden the scope of the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> and lend intellectual credibility to Himmler's operation.
In
musicologists the SS found a commitment that extended beyond detailed
research
into the application of their findings as consultants and administrators
in the
Germanization of the expanding Reich.

<p>
That musicologists demonstrated more commitment to the so-called
"national-political" <I>(volkspolitisch)</I> or "cultural-political"
<I>(kulturpolitisch)</I> goals of the SS<I> </I>than the folklorists
relates back
to the special nature of musicology as a newcomer to the academy,
preserving its
ties to music practice. These differences are revealed most clearly in the
approaches to folk-music research, an area in which musicologists
demonstrated an
emotional investment and a drive to bridge the gap between theory and
practice.
For many musicologists of this generation, the earliest exposure to folk
music
was through extracurricular involvement with the Youth Music Movement as
leaders
and consultants.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
By some of their later admissions, they had
felt
restricted by traditional subject areas forced upon them, while the
amateur music
movement pursued its own agenda.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, for
example,
confessed that as a student of the "strict science" of historical
musicology
before World War I, he was baffled by the gap between scholarship and
practice.
His experiences as a soldier reawakened in him the importance of communal
singing
of folk songs for building camaraderie, nostalgia, and patriotism. He and
his
generation resolved to reform musicology, closing the gap with music
making and
raising folk music to a respectable subject worthy of study, and the
National
Socialist revolution finally made this possible.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
When musicologists grew more interested in folk music, they were inspired
by the
current movements in amateur music practice as well as their
disappointment with
existing methodologies.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
In their view, the nonmusicologists
who had
dominated folk-song research had neglected the "song" factor, paying far
more
attention to text than to melody. The scholarly study of folk song had for
too
long been the exclusive domain of Germanists and later folklorists who
subjected
their material to strict philological treatment and sterile
classification. They
had also forgotten the "folk" factor, producing meaningless work because
it did
not originate in an intimate relationship with the communities producing
the
music.
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p>
After 1933, those who outlined the tasks, goals, and achievements of
musicology
in the new state highlighted the importance of folk music for the entire
discipline.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The education ministry's establishment of a
department
of German folk music in the State Institute made it possible to realize
the plans
to reform the discipline that M&uuml;ller-Blattau had articulated, by
consolidating resources in one location and by indicating the state's
support for
work in that direction. By the time Kurt Huber (best known as a martyr
executed
for his involvement with the "White Rose" student resistance movement)
became
director of the institute's folk music division in March 1937, he had been
vocal
in promoting a methodology that would reveal the "German folk-soul"
<I>(deutsche
Volksseele)</I> and would make folk music accessible to the public. The
scholar,
in his view, bore the responsibility of dictating the "purity" of folk
song by
weeding out destructive, parasitic obscenities and sentimentalities found
in
ballads, cabaret, and popular songs.
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Other musicologists who
were
simultaneously involved in practical activities followed suit, promoting
an
"applied" science of folk music research that would involve musicologists
in
education, adult education, and the everyday music making of state, party,
public, and private institutions.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

<p>
The central research facility in Berlin laid the scholarly groundwork for
the
serious study of German folk music, and the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> provided
the
means for field research that would allow musicologists to conduct their
work
along the lines they desired: establishing an intimate relationship with
the
originating communities, amassing large amounts of material, and
ultimately
processing that material for the practical use of the growing number of
amateur,
state, party, and military musical groups.

V. Music in the Creation of a Germanic Cult
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The significance of folk music as conceived by the SS, it must be noted,
had its
own peculiar emphasis. While Himmler was known to have a special interest
in folk
songs, the SS's concerns were part of a larger scheme to define the
Germanic
race, and the focus on folk music was arrived at only later as the most
efficient
means toward that end, after investing in such obscure historical projects
as the
reconstruction of the lur.

<p>
Setting out with a vague goal of determining the musical manifestations of
the
Germanic race, the initial plans for musicological research within the SS
centered on forming a research staff to investigate "Nordic" music, a
commission
that remained 

<B></B>

 unstaffed.
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
In the course of the war, the
terminology
shifted to concentrate on "Indo-germanic" music, and the SS organizers
decided,
somewhat arbitrarily, that "only folk music could contribute to this area"
<I>(DAS,</I> 194).
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
Himmler appointed Quellmalz, a folk music
expert, as the new director of the Research Center for
Indo-Germanic/Germanic
Music (Forschungsst&auml;tte f&uuml;r indogermanisch-deutsche Musik), with
plans
to extend future folk music research into Scandinavia, Holland, and
Belgium.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
A comprehensive overview of folk music, alleged to
be a
pure manifestation of Germanic music, would hold the key to compiling a
musical
picture of the collective Germanic race, and the concentrated effort in
the South
Tyrolean enclave followed the corollary that ethnic German enclaves had
managed
to preserve purer manifestations of their Germanness in their efforts to
ward off
encroaching foreign influences.

<p>
Despite the wartime concentration on folk music, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> did
not
entirely ignore historical pursuits. As late as 1942 it established a
precedent
by encouraging research on topics dating earlier than the year
1300.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Even projects so seemingly remote from SS aims as
Schottl&auml;nder's work on ancient Greek notation were deemed relevant,
for they
were part of a process of thoroughly scrutinizing the early history of
Europe to
detect any traits which could, by any stretch of the imagination, be
interpreted
as Germanic. The ultimate goal of the SS, after purifying the German
population
of all undesirable elements, was to create an entire Germanic cult with
its own
rituals and history, and to draw up a comprehensive plan for the correct
education and indoctrination of the racially purified nation. In order to
do so,
one needed to prove the early existence of such a race and create a
history for
it. While Himmler developed a cult for the Germanic race, music historians
in his
employment scrutinized relics for traces of prehistoric music practice,
medieval
sources for indications of "Germanic" influences among the various
versions of
Gregorian chant, and folk music for the simple elements of "ur-German
music,"
with the goal of bringing the essence of the Germanic race to life through
music.
Himmler's fabled interest in Gregorian chant was therefore part of a plan
to
demonstrate the long existence of a Germanic race through documentation,
unlike
the more speculative folk-music approach.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

<p>
The SS preoccupation with uncovering and reviving artifacts and rituals of
the
remote Germanic past can be regarded as a bizarre culmination of the
pervasive
sentiments of nostalgia and nationalism--both of which had corresponding
effects
on music practice and music scholarship, and both of which grew out of
romanticism and gained momentum after the turn of the century. Postwar
Germany
was especially consumed by concerns that created a longing for harmony,
national
unity, and for "simpler" times: the insecurity of living in a society that
had
been split into dozens of political and social factions, the degradation
and loss
of national pride following the military defeat, the fears of economic
distress,
the threat of poverty, and encroaching foreign capitalist interests.

<p>
Nostalgia and the glorification of folk culture, a central feature of
romanticism, overlapped with the drive toward German unification in 1871
and the
creation of a 

<B></B>

 concept of German nationhood. The
German Youth Movement then
arose
around 1900 in response to rapid industrialization of the late nineteenth
century, the depersonalized nature of urban-industrial society, and the
perceived
threat of socialism and the labor movements. Bourgeois youths took to
roaming the
countryside, conjuring up fantasies of Germany's medieval past, and
seeking
camaraderie through extracurricular cultural activities.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
The
Youth
Music Movement, its musical counterpart, similarly rejected an existing
culture
dominated by individualism, "art for art's sake," the cult of genius, and
public
musical institutions that promoted these bourgeois ideals--concerts,
operas, and
the music profession in general. They searched for an "objective" music
that
could bond the entire "people's community" <I>(Volksgemeinschaft) </I>and
set out
to discover a "communal music culture" <I>(Gemeinschaftsmusikkultur)</I>
that
would exploit the "community-building power of music"
<I>(gemeinschaftsbildende
Kraft der Musik).</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>

<p>
Nostalgia and a desire for national unity spread beyond the Youth Music
Movement
into the growing amateur movement, politics, and the sentiments of
musicologists.
Scholars such as Sch&uuml;nemann, Gurlitt, Schrade, and
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, to
name a few, openly expressed their belief that music could smooth over
differences, that communal music making could heal the wounds dividing
German
society, and that music education was the means toward this
end.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Many agreed that the music of the nineteenth century had become too
subjective
and alienated from the <I>Volk,</I> and this alienation could be linked to
the
many ills of modern society, such as technology and
materialism.
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
The time had come for music once again to be in service to the
<I>Volk,</I> as it
had been in preindustrial times, and its return could be facilitated
through the
cultivation of folk music and the encouragement of amateur
participation.
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>

<p>
The draw to the past was fueled not only by musicologists' intensive
historical
training, but also by their utter confusion with regard to trends in music
of the
present. Even those who made a valiant attempt to come to terms with
modern
composition found themselves at a loss to comprehend it.
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
By
1933
musicologists seemed to lose interest in the burning issues of modern
music,
probably because, as the literature indicates, such burning issues had
simply
been extinguished. While Mersmann had once described Schoenberg's
alienation from
the public as "the burden of the prophet" and looked forward with
anticipation to
the creations of Haba and Krenek, by 1932 Moser was dismissing Schoenberg
and his
school as eccentric zealots whose time had passed.
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
The cooperation between the SS and musicology transcended mutual
exploitation for
immediate practical gains. This cooperation was founded on a deeper
understanding
that grew out of the shared goals of the SS, the Nazi state, and the
guardians of
German <I>Kultur.</I> More than other scholars, however, German
musicologists
came to be regarded as the guardians of Germany's most prized legacy. In
1939, in
a commemorative volume for Hitler's fiftieth birthday, Friedrich Blume
described
his own field in the following terms: "German musicology has the task of
protecting one of the noblest commodities of German culture. Music has
always
been the most vital 

<B></B>

 and most characteristic
expression of the German
spirit. . .
. The heritage of German music dictates [musicology's]
commission."
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>

<p>
Music had long been regarded as the crowning achievement of the German
nation,
and musicologists had by this time become so firmly committed to
understanding
the history and practice of German music, and more recently to discovering
"untainted" manifestations in "primitive" folk music, that they could
conceivably
share in the state's belief that music was "the most German of the arts."
For the
Nazi state, the full rehabilitation of German identity, severely damaged
after
World War I, relied on the preservation of musical institutions as well as
constant reminders of the history of German musical superiority. For the
SS, the
establishment of a Germanic cult would similarly rely heavily on music as
the
purest expression of the Germanic soul and one of the most consistent
demonstrations of the strength of Germanic race in the face of
adversities. To
achieve these ends, the cooperation of musicologists was indispensable.

Creation
of a Nation," <I>German Studies Review: Special Issue, German Identity</I>

5-30. In 1928, one music historian boasted that despite the war and
inflation,
Germany had managed to maintain approximately fifty opera houses and
"perhaps one
hundred fifty orchestras of rank," while world-famous conductors were
"rebuilding
our value as a nation since 1918" with the richness of free-lance musical
offerings in one hundred string quartets, fifty piano trios, twenty-five
chamber
music groups with winds, at least fifteen oratorio quartets and madrigal
groups,
smaller vocal groups and countless solo singers--"this," he wrote, "is a
fool-proof measurement of the level of German musical culture." (The
original
reads: "Wenn man bedenkt, welche deutsche Kulturmacht die heutigen rund 50
Opernh&auml;usen und vielleicht 150 Orchester von Rang darstellen, die
unser Volk
im Gegensatz zu allen anderen Nationen trotz des Zusammenbruchs von 1918
immer
noch besitzt und mit M&uuml;he erh&auml;lt, so kann man daraus ablesen,
was die
Musik im geistigen Haushalt der Nation bedeutet," and "Vor allem
geh&ouml;rt zu
unserem Nationalreichtum der heutige Besitz von mindestens 100 reisenden
Streichquartettvereinigungen, 50 Klaviertrios, 25 Kammer-musikgruppen mit
Bl&auml;sern, von mehr als je 15 Oratorienquartetten und

The Wagner cult was in a state of decline after 1926, and Hitler, a
long-time
admirer of Wagner and frequent guest at Bayreuth, became the chief
benefactor of
the Bayreuth Festival to keep it alive; see Hubert Kolland,
"Wagner-Rezeption im
deutschen Faschismus," in <I>Bericht &uuml;ber den internationalen
musikwissenschaftlichen Kongre&szlig; Bayreuth 1981,</I> eds.
Christoph-Hellmut
Mahling and Sigrid Weismann (Kassel: B&auml;renreiter, 1984), 501. Each
year,
Hitler purchased tens of thousands of marks worth of tickets, he
contributed RM
50,000 for each new production, and in 1940 he provided for half a million
marks
to keep the festival running; see Fred K. Prieburg, <I>Musik im
NS-Staat</I>
(Frankfurt: Fischer, 1982), 307. When Winifred wanted to suspend the
festival
when the war broke out, Hitler averted its closure by designating it a war
festival, opening it up to soldiers and thereby facilitating government
subsidies; see Michael Karbaum, <I>Studien zur Geschichte der Bayreuther
Festpiele (1876-1976)</I> (Regensburg: Bosse, 1976), 91-93. The Berlin
Philharmonic, after more than a decade of financial struggle and failed
attempts
to come under the protection of the Berlin, Prussian, or Reich
governments,
finally found a sympathetic ear in the Nazi government, and became a Reich
Orchestra <I>(Reichsorchester)</I> in 1933 under the sponsorship of the
propaganda minister; see my "The Nazi 'Seizure' of the Berlin
Philharmonic, or

Fritz Ringer's compelling argument designates Weimar professors as
Germany's
degenerating "mandarin intellectuals," and describes them as a class that
achieved its high social position from educational achievements rather
than from
inherited land or acquired capital. They reached their peak during the
transition
between agrarian and industrial economies, at which time they dictated the
mission of the nation and state in terms of its intellectual and spiritual
life
and saw themselves as the spiritual nobility of the nation. This had
empowered
them to resist any interference from ruling parties and insist on the
preservation of the academic freedom and self-government granted to them.

Fritz K. Ringer, <I>The Decline of the German Mandarins: The German
Academic
Community, 1890-1933</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,

The <I>Vernunftrepublikaner</I> (pragmatic Republicans) were a small
minority,
while the apolitical "silent majority" longed for the glorious days of the
Kaiser
and resented a system that had grown out of a lost war. They associated
the
Republic with the current overcrowded universities, a perceived decline in
scholarship, and the economic disaster of hyperinflation that accompanied
the
Republic's early years and reduced their own standard of living; see
Helmut
Heiber, <I>Universit&auml;t unterm Hakenkreuz. Teil I: Der Professor im
Dritten
Reich</I> (Munich: K. G. Saur, 1991), 32, 35-39. Most assumed the persona
of the
unpolitical intellectual, characterized by Thomas Mann in his essay
"Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen": the culture bearers of the German
nation who
held themselves above the workings of politics, dedicated themselves to
scientific objectivity, and defended German <I>Kultur</I> against the
invasion of
western <I>Zivilisation.</I> See Wolfgang Abendroth, "Die deutschen

See Ringer, <I>Decline,</I> 228-9. Becker, himself a university
professor,
understood the problems inside the university and wanted only to modernize
the
oligarchy without dismantling it, but the majority of professors saw his
suggestions as the unacceptable mixing of scholarship with politics and a
reprehensible attempt at "democratizing" the university. One historian
argues
that Becker's suggestions never came close to undermining academic freedom
or
self-rule, but universities were so staunchly reactionary as to thwart
even those
measures that might have improved the functioning of the institution; see

Peter Bleuel, <I>Deutschlands Bekenner: Professoren zwischen Kaiserreich
und
Diktatur</I> (Munich: Scherz, 1968), 162-6.

According to Freidrich Blume, the older mathematical study of the
science of
music had died out in German universities by the eighteenth century, and a
new
approach evolved from the appointment of the university music director
into a
systematic training in musicianship in combination with music history.
Most of
the earliest musicologists either received their training in other
humanities
disciplines or in practical music, and most universities delayed accepting
musicology as an academic discipline. When musicology proved itself a
worthy
academic pursuit, a split developed between those who remained close to
music
practice and those who "locked themselves up in ivory towers." In Blume's
assessment, this ideological split in the academic community has
never been
resolved and the role of music in the German university has never been
clearly
defined. See Friedrich Blume, "Musicology in German Universities,"
<I>Current
Musicology</I> 9 : 52-64.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT11" HREF="#REF11">11</a>.
Around the turn of the century, Hermann Kretzschmar advocated that
musicology's first responsibility was to music and musicians, not other
sciences
(Hermann Kretzschmar, <I>Musikalische Zeitfragen</I> [Leipzig: C. F.
Peters,
1903], 79), and the pressures of the Weimar era caused musicologists to
give new
consideration to Kretzschmar's admonition. Most notably, Arnold Schering
criticized the growing gulf between contemporary musical scholarship and
composition, a product of musicology's tendency to bury itself in the
past; see
Arnold Schering, "Musikwissenschaft und Kunst der Gegenwart," <I>Bericht
&uuml;ber den I. Musikwissenschaftlichen Kongress der Deutschen
Musikgesellschaft
in Leipzig</I> (Leipzig: Breitkopf und H&auml;rtel, 1926), 13-14.

Toward the end of World War I, more than sixty new periodicals
dedicated to
music education, folk music, and amateur music organizations
appeared. Even
though many did not outlive their first issue, the burgeoning of
publishing
activity represents a heightened concern with the cultivation of music for
and by
the public.

and
concludes with practical suggestions for current times; see Georg
Sch&uuml;nemann, <I>Geschichte der deutschen Schulmusik</I> (Leipzig:

educators and stressed the practical importance of musicology for the
education
of the musician; see Ernst B&uuml;cken, "Die Musikerziehung auf der

<I>Handbuch der Musikerziehung,</I> ed. Ernst B&uuml;cken (Potsdam:

Albrecht

The Socialist Party had sponsored recreational organizations as early
as the
1890s to promote a workers' culture distinct from that of the bourgeoisie,
but
the choral groups of the workers' movement gradually became less
politically
engaged and more musically ambitious as their numbers increased. By 1928,
many
groups had become virtually indistinguishable from their bourgeois
counterparts,
and, in an attempt to raise their musical standards, enlisted professional
conductors and included middle-class members. See W. L. Guttsman,

Culture in Weimar Germany: Between Tradition and Commitment</I> (New York:

The Youth Music Movement drew many of its ideas from the writings of
Ernst
Kurth, and musicologists such as Moser and Karl Hasse got caught up in
some of
its more controversial issues, such as the problems of leadership and
criticism
of its "pseudoaesthetic"; see Hans Joachim Moser, "Noch ein Wort zur
Musikalischen Jugendbewegung," <I>Allgemeine Musikzeitung,</I> 7 May 1926,
381-2,
and the response by Karl Hasse, "Zur Frage der F&uuml;hrung in der
Jugendmusik,"
<I>Allgemeine Musikzeitung,</I> 11 June 1926, 527-8. Sch&uuml;nemann
declared the
need to encourage the revival of private music making not only because
this
activity had always been responsible for German musical superiority, but
also
because of its economic benefits for the music industry and the publishing
industry; see Georg Sch&uuml;nemann, "Die Lage der Hausmusik," <I>Die
Musik</I>
24 (May 1932): 561-4. Eugen Schmitz advocated that private music making
should
regain the prominence it once enjoyed, despite the difficulties since the
war
caused by the high prices of musical instruments and printed music. He
suggested
that cheaper instruments, such as the guitar and the clavichord, be mass
produced
to replace the more expensive lute and piano, and that the paper shortage
be
circumvented by state intervention, driving up the prices of "useless"
entertainment music and keeping the prices of art music at a minimum; see
Eugen
Schmitz, "Die Zukunft der Hausmusik," <I>Hochland</I> 17 (May 1920):
254-6.

Hermann Abert contended that World War I had contributed to the
awareness
that there was much to be done in the area of German music: "indeed, the
war has
confronted us with a whole series of new tasks, especially those of
national
character, and reminded us that a great deal of neglected work beckons in
our own
house, work that we had passed over in favor of international relations,
not
always to the advantage of our national music culture." (The original
reads: "ja
der Krieg hat uns auch auf diesem Gebiete vor eine ganze Reihe neuer
Aufgaben,
vor allem nationalen Charakters gestellt, und uns daran erinnert,
da&szlig; im
eigenen Hause noch sehr viel ungetane Arbeit harrt, an der wir fr&uuml;her
zugunsten internationaler Beziehungen und nicht immer zum Vorteil unserer
nationaler Musikkultur vor&uuml;bergegangen sind," in "Aufruf zur
Gr&uuml;ndung
der Deutschen Musikgesellschaft," 1 December 1917, Adolf Sandberger
Papers, file
Ana 431, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Munich.) Hans Engel noted that even
in bad
economic times, one could always count on support from cities, counties,
and
communities; see Hans Engel, "Organisationsfragen der Musikwissenschaft,"
<I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft</I> 14 (February 1932): 272-6.

See my "The <I>Deutsche Musikgesellschaft,</I> 1918-1938," <I>Journal

works on
music published annually in the <I>Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters</I>
reveals a heightened concentration on German music history, especially in
the
1930s, and the tables of contents of the recognized scholarly journals
yield even
more striking statistics: the <I>Archiv f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft,</I>
which ran
from 1918 to 1925, devoted at least half of its articles to German music
history,
and in the <I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft,</I> studies on
Germany
tended to outnumber all other studies by at least fifty percent from the
1920-21

In 1933, Heinrich Husmann recommended the establishment of a central
agency
for the expertise of young scholars to serve the <I>Volk;</I> see Husmann,
"Musikkultur und Volksbildung," <I>Allgemeine Musikzeitung,</I> 9 June
1933,
309-10. In 1935, Siegfried Goslich opened a report by a student group with
a
quote from Hitler and the recognition that "the penetration of the entire
life of
our <I>Volk</I> with National Socialist ideology has awakened the feeling
of
obligation to come to terms with the new situation in the younger
generation of
musicologists." (The original reads: "Die Durchdringung unseres gesamten
Volkslebens mit der nationalsozialistischen Weltanschauung hat in der
jungen
Generation der Musikwissenschaft das Gef&uuml;hl der Verpflichtung
zu einer
Auseinandersetzung mit der neuen Gegebenheiten wachgerufen," in Siegfried
Goslich, "Studium und Beruf des jungen Musikwissenschaftlers," <I>Die
Musik</I>
27 [January 1935]: 283.) Fellerer came up with additional suggestions for
the
state to use the skills of musicologists, arguing that if musicology is to
be
bound to the <I>Volk,</I> it must apply itself to practical areas and not
leave
them open to dilettantes; see Karl Gustav Fellerer, "Praktische
Musikwissenschaft," <I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</I> 103 (January 1936):

For example, Alfred Morgenroth, the consultant in charge of

See Bose to Weisthor, 26 June 1937, Bundesarchiv Koblenz. He was
awaiting
approval from the education ministry to teach courses in Musical Race
Studies
<I>(Musikalische Rassenkunde),</I> and hoped that Himmler might put in a
good
word for him. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I> considered his request (Weisthor to
Wolff, 1
July 1937, Bose file), but decided that, owing to his young age and lack
of a
<I>Habilitation,</I> he should not be given a full position or benefit
from
Himmler's intervention on his behalf to the education ministry; see

Himmler's office impressed upon the education ministry the patriotic
importance
of the project and the necessity to release Quellmalz from his obligations
to the
ministry while continuing to pay his regular salary, a condition with
which the
education ministry was not happy to comply; see RFK to REM and

Joseph M&uuml;ller-Blattau, Walther Lipphardt, Hans Mersmann, and
Wilhelm
Ehmann were noted for their active participation in the Youth Music
Movement, and
as the movement grew, more musicologists began to take part in
conferences,
performances, retreats and publications. In 1926, a Youth Movement
conference
featured lectures by Friedrich Blume, Hans Mersmann, Wilibald Gurlitt, and
Hans
Joachim Moser; in 1927, Moser, Gurlitt, and Heinrich Besseler gave
lectures and
performances at the national retreat for group leaders in Lichtenthal; and
Moser
participated in three more such events in 1929. See <I>Die Deutsche

Kurt Huber, in outlining his plans for the structure of the folk music
division of the Staatliches Institut, regarded the development of folk
music
research as the task of a new generation, referring to the early influence
of the
Youth Music Movement on that generation of musicologists that inspired
them to
explore "national music research" when their time came; see Kurt Huber,

In his keynote address at the first musicological meeting in the Third

Friedrich Blume singled out the comparative study of Gregorian chant as
the best
source for isolating specific traits of the Germanic race in music. The
speech
was published as "Musik und Rasse," <I>Die Musik</I> 30 : 736-48,
and Blume
then developed it into a lengthier essay and published it as <I>Das

Schering sadly admitted that the musical meaning of expressionist
composition
still eluded him and others, and failed to provide the "joy of living"
that music
always provided (Schering, "Die expressionistische Bewegung in der Musik,"
in
<I>Einf&uuml;hrung in die Kunst der Gegenwart</I> [Leipzig: E. A. Seemann,
1919],
161). Hans Mersmann commented on a decline in the emotional content of
music even
in the works of Strauss and Mahler; see Hans Mersmann, <I>Musik der
Gegenwart</I>
(Berlin: Julius Brand, 1927), 12-13.

See Hans Mersmann, <I>Musik der Gegenwart,</I> 54-55, 62-63. Moser
concluded
that Schoenberg and his school had now found themselves in a dead end, and
their
chance to have a lasting impact on musical development had been lost to
more
promising younger contemporaries and the growth of amateur performance.
Krenek,
one of the up and coming, had matured from "cacophanist in the good graces
of
atonality" to show a "fortunate return to 'comprehensible' music." (The
original
reads: "Gewi&szlig; hat Krenek, in seinem 'Orpheus' noch Kakaphonist von
Atonalit&auml;tsgnaden, seit einigen Jahren einen erfreulichen R&uuml;cken
zur
'verst&auml;ndlichen' Musik angetreten . . . ," in Hans Joachim Moser,

im Gef&uuml;ge dieser Zeit," <I>Deutsche Rundschau</I> 233 [December

The original reads: "Die deutsche Musikwissenschaft hat eines der
edelsten
G&uuml;ter der deutschen Kultur zu h&uuml;ten. Von je ist die Musik eine
der
lebendigsten und eigenartigsten Pr&auml;gungen des deutschen Geistes
gewesen. Das
deutsche Volk hat sich und seinem Schicksal in der Musik seit
Jahrhunderten eine
'Siegesallee' gro&szlig;artigster Denkmale gesetzt. Mit dieser Tatsache
ist einer
Musikforschung, die es mit ihren Pflichten gegen Volk und Staat ernst
nimmt, die
Ausrichtung vorgezeichnet. Das Erbe der deutschen Musik diktiert seinen
Auftrag"
