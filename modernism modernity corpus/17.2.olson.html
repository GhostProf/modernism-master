<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  This article draws on unpublished archival material to illuminate Gertrude Stein’s visits to Chicago during the 1930s. Stein caused a sensation all over the city--especially among the city’s literary ladies--but also met with resistance at the University of Chicago. Stein’s time in Chicago reveals the complex relationship among gender, literary celebrity, and the reception of literary modernism, as well as the ways in which an avant-garde lesbian writer becomes a “great” writer in a tradition that is dominated by men. Most importantly, Stein’s reception in Chicago is central to understanding new arguments not only about Stein’s identity but also about Stein’s aesthetic, which was significantly impacted by her experiences in a city characterized by its “middle”-ness and mobility.

<p>
	When <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> was published in 1933, Gertrude Stein became a literary celebrity. Her friend the photographer and novelist Carl Van Vechten told her that she was “on every tongue like Greta Garbo.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Stein and Alice B. Toklas found that Stein’s name lit up New York City marquees when they arrived in America for Stein’s 1934–1935 lecture tour; while across the country, in every town and city, she was greeted by crowds.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In Chicago, however, Stein’s reception was marked by initial difficulties. “Everywhere else it had all been easy but here [in Chicago] the trouble began,” Stein explains in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> . “For the first time they were making arrangements that did not please me and I was beginning to say so.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Stein had friends in Chicago and a wide readership eager for her visit—she had not been back to the United States since she left for France in 1903—but the University of Chicago (unlike other institutions) was at first resistant to her, causing much confusion about when and where and to whom Stein would lecture. Stein wanted her first lecture at the university to be the English department’s annual William Vaughn Moody lecture, named after a professor who had taught Stein at Radcliffe before coming to Chicago.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> But the selection committee hedged and eventually chose the popular but less experimental poet Edna St. Vincent Millay instead.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> There were also problems with finding a suitable lecture hall, with limiting the audience to 500 students or fewer (a request that Stein made for all of her American lectures), with overbooking, and with charging students an admission fee.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein thus cancelled her lectures there. Two of Stein’s friends who had been organizing Stein’s other engagements around the city—<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> writer Fanny Butcher and Bobsy Goodspeed, a prominent society re—stepped in to straighten out affairs. Finally, “Poetry and Grammar,” sponsored by the English department, was delivered at the International House on November 28, 1934 and “Pictures” the following week, sponsored by the Renaissance Society, an international organization promoting contemporary art on campus although not affiliated with the university.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Stein delivered both lectures to packed audiences.
      </p>
<p>
	Without such organizational difficulties, Stein spoke all over the city to many nonacademic audiences that were excited to see and hear her. She drew huge crowds at her December book signing at Marshall Fields department store. In her diary, Fanny Butcher describes how the store was “so jammed that they wouldn’t even let us off the third floor . . . . we nearly lost our lives getting to [Stein and Toklas].”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Butcher chronicled every step of Stein’s visits for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, the city’s most widely read paper at the time with a daily circulation of over seven hundred thousand readers and a Sunday circulation of over one million.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> She later wrote about Stein in her memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">Many Lives—One Love</span> . (Butcher’s “one love” is books.) My title comes from this memoir in which Butcher describes the sensation that Stein caused in Chicago but also the resistance Stein felt from the University of Chicago. Presumably, Stein is the “invincible force” and the University of Chicago is the “immoveable object,” though the ambiguity proves potent in my argument about how Stein’s personality is both an agent and also an absence in the critical reception of her work (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 419). This short but important story in the history of literary modernism, which I bring to light through unpublished archival material, raises questions about the performance of being a writer—in particular, a writer whose work the public does not wholly understand. It is also a story that reveals the complex relationship among gender, literary celebrity, and the reception of literary modernism, as well as the ways in which an avant-garde lesbian writer becomes a “great” writer in a tradition that is dominated by men, especially within the university. Along these lines, and most importantly, Stein’s 1930s Chicago visits illuminate a tension between the avant-garde and the institutional, between Stein’s radical experiments with language and the University of Chicago’s curriculum of “Great Books,” which was being launched in the 1930s by university president Robert Hutchins and his newly hired philosophy of law professor, Mortimer Adler.
      </p>
<p>
	Chicago was a city of mobility and middleness, and Stein projected these qualities in her time there. Stein did not have an exclusive group of readers in Chicago, as I will discuss in the first section below in context of Stein’s popular appeal. Rather, she found herself performing for and moving among various communities, including huge public audiences, an intimate group of literary ladies, and a university crowd. Indeed, once the University of Chicago experienced the success of Stein’s first visit to campus, President Robert Hutchins asked Stein if she would return later in her tour to deliver another set of lectures. Stein accepted, and in February 1935 she and Toklas stayed for over two weeks in Thornton Wilder’s Hyde Park apartment while Stein met with students and wrote and delivered lectures specifically for the University of Chicago audience. The  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> University of Chicago Press eventually published these lectures as <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span>.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Stein later wrote to Wilder: “I love Chicago and I guess I liked the two weeks there in your apartment and with all your family the best of everything, and I think I tell everybody so so much so that Alice tells me not to because it is not polite to the others but it is true and we did have a most awfully good time there” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 24). Chicago was the American city that Stein and Toklas preferred above all the others, and they returned to it four times on their tour (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 333–51).
      </p>
<p>
	Chicago’s distinctive qualities are numerous—especially during the 1930s when fresh capital, new immigrants, world-renowned architecture, jazz, and a rising cultural class vitalized the city—but perhaps the most obvious fact about Chicago is that it is a very big city in the middle of the country. During the 1930s most travelers between the coasts would pass through Chicago on the Century Limited or the Commodore Vanderbilt trains and often stay in the city for several nights; more lines of track fanned out from Chicago in all directions than in any other American city.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Chicago’s “geography,” a word that Stein uses in several of her titles, is an important concept for Stein, and crucial to understanding why she loved the city both literally and aesthetically. Geography signifies not only physical location but also the spatial arrangement of words on a page. In her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures at the University of Chicago, which I will discuss at more length below, Stein vaunted the mobility of American people and how they forced the American language to have “a different feeling of moving” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). “Moving” language, according to Stein, rejects classical narrative structure, rejects a “beginning and a middle and an ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Stein suggests that American writing poses a challenge to an Aristotelian concept of a work’s coherence. American language—like the city of Chicago—was language that expanded out in all directions, spatially unbound. And Stein’s geography of middleness and mobility was also part of her persona: Stein was a re who navigated the middle of things, who moved freely among different circles. As a long-time resident of France who was yet an American, a society lady who yet appeared manly, a Radcliffe-educated woman who was distanced from university culture, and a very famous writer whose major works were mostly unknown, Stein’s affiliations were inside and out.
      </p>
<p>
	Consequently Stein is a re upon whom many groups have laid a claim, from the French Dadaists of the 1920s and the visual artists she befriended, to the writers of the “Lost Generation,” scholars of feminism, Jewishness, and gender studies, and practitioners of language poetry, to name a few. Stein’s Chicago reception is central to an account of her fluctuating status and to understanding new arguments not only about Stein’s identity but also about Stein’s aesthetic. Critics of Stein’s work disagree in particular about how to understand its specific kind of difficulty. Powerful arguments have been made recently that suggest two very different approaches, and an examination of Stein’s time in Chicago illuminates the historical and sociological roots that lie beneath this theoretical divide. On the one hand, critics who champion language poetry argue that Stein wants textual interpretation to be governed individually by each reader; namely, meaning is localized by the experience of an “autonomous” reader every time the text is read, and thus a reader’s personality—and a reader’s sense of an author behind  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the text—can be very much a part of a text’s meaning. On the other hand, critics argue that Stein’s texts are themselves autonomous, that Stein’s commitment is to putting forth impersonal ideas apart from the reader or Stein herself.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> To look at how Stein herself advanced her work is to see how she created these two very different models: how she promoted pleasure and personality among a mainstream reading public, and how she promoted ideas and impersonality among a university crowd. Essentially Stein sought fame—which meant a positive, widespread response from all kinds of readers, across lines that demarcated class, gender, and geography. This fact explains why she welcomed varied responses to her work, and it also underpins our critical conception of her texts as oriented to each reader’s idiosyncratic experiences of them. But Stein also wanted her works to stand on their own, to have ideas in them that would make them great, and this fact upholds readings of Stein’s writing that emphasize its impersonality. Stein wanted it both ways.
      </p>
<p>
	The story of Stein’s visits to Chicago also expands our conception of what it means to “understand” Stein’s modernist aesthetic, which was characterized by humor, self-reflexivity, sexual punning, and musicality that immediately appealed to many readers even as they were outspoken about not “getting it.” Stein gave tips about how to read her work and she did not disparage those who might be called “middlebrow,” as another famous modernist, Virginia Woolf, used the term.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Stein explained to a reporter in 1935, “I like ordinary people who don’t bore me. Highbrows do, you know, always do.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> As recent studies have shown, many modernist writers challenged the equation between high modernism and elitism; Stein, too, broadly advertised her writing and was read widely across cultural and class lines.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the 1930s, popular periodicals— especially daily newspapers—were attuned to new writers like Stein more than ever before.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Stein was read differently, however, than the work of other modernist writers. During Stein’s lifetime the reception of her work—especially among the educated but academically unaffiliated—was characterized by pleasurable sensation and interpretative openness. Rather than trying to locate the essential meaning behind Stein’s texts, many of Stein’s readers were encouraged to hear it, sense it, and laugh at it without feeling that they understood it. The incomprehensibility of Stein’s work actually had the effect of promoting simple sensory pleasure. In her explanations about how to understand her work, as I will show, Stein raised the larger issue of how to understand <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> literary text, as if complete mastery could ever be achieved. These points should make us question the ways that Stein has been read as a modernist re akin to other modernists who had moments of fame despite the fact (or because of the fact) that their works are also notoriously difficult. Stein’s difficulty is not the same, and she publicized her personality—that is, herself—as naturally as she publicized her writings. Furthermore, Stein may be the mother of the avant-garde, but she was never so ahead of her times as to obscure, to her mind, the primary aim of a literary text—which is immediate, effortless pleasure.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	    Stein and Toklas mostly traveled by train throughout their 1934–35 lecture tour, but soon after arriving in America they took a last-minute flight to Chicago for the city’s premiere of Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints In Three Acts.</span> This marked the first time that they would see the opera performed, which Stein had written with Virgil Thomson. The flight to Chicago was also their first experience on an airplane. They loved it: the view of America from above, Stein writes, “made any one know why the post-cubist painting was what it was” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 197). When she looked down on America, she saw many places all at once, a geographical composition below her that she compared to modernist art, and which inspired her own aesthetic. Her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures describe the kind of language that corresponds to this geography of many places: “moving” language going in all directions. Flying to Chicago not only clarified, for Stein, the origins and direction of modernist art but also her understanding of who was receptive to it. It was the literary ladies of Chicago—Fanny Butcher and Bobsy Goodspeed among others who I will describe below—who greeted Stein and Toklas when they stepped foot off the plane. These women were eager for art and culture from back East but especially from abroad, and they enthusiastically embraced “La Stein,” as Butcher called her. In contrast, Stein did not have an advocate at the University of Chicago until Goodspeed introduced her to Thornton Wilder on Stein’s second trip to Chicago. Wilder was also very famous at the time, having won his first Pulitzer in 1928 for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</span>. Partly because of his success, Wilder was offered a special lectureship at the University of Chicago by its president, Robert Hutchins, who had been Wilder’s classmate at Oberlin and Yale. Indeed, even within an academic setting, the famous writer-in-residence—an offensive new position from the point of view of the professors—first welcomed Stein.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> She secured a popular audience much before she was established as a major modernist writer within the academy.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Longtime literary editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Fanny Butcher was someone who could navigate among the various groups of readers in Chicago, and she is key to my argument about Stein’s popular reception. Butcher came from very little money but she nonetheless made her way to the University of Chicago—commuting to campus at first though her mother complained that she was not “working gainfully” she was “just pleasuring [her]self” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 26). Butcher graduated in 1910 and soon began her career in journalism. She also opened and managed a bookshop in Chicago, Fanny Butcher Books, from 1919 to 1927, a job that combined pleasure with gain, and which kept her attuned to the market appeal of certain books (or lack thereof). Butcher befriended many of the most famous American writers of the time—including Sinclair Lewis, Edna Ferber, H. L. Mencken, Ernest Hemingway, and Willa Cather. Her cultural clout came also from her visits to Europe, where she met George Bernard Shaw,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> James Joyce, and in 1931, Gertrude Stein (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 416–19). Butcher’s readers could rely on her to introduce new books in a bright and straightforward manner. Butcher was a Midwesterner (she was born in Kansas and spent almost all of her life in Chicago), and her literary sensibility was both ambitious and consciously common sense. For example, consider a passage from a column (written months before Stein’s first visit) describing Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      You, as reader, have something of the feeling of a rock against which the sea of her words beats constantly, in rhythm, in flow and ebb . . . and although she writes more of ideas than she does of the actual doings of her characters, when you have finished “The Making of Americans” you know all the members of the Hersland family better than you have known any human beings you have met in literature.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Butcher here celebrates the reading experience as both purely sensory—the reader’s “feeling” is vital to the book’s meaning—and purely intellectual—this is writing of “ideas.” These modes dominate (and often polarize) Stein’s readers, but to Butcher they pose no conflict. Foreshadowing another famous review of Stein’s work—by John Ashbery, about which I will say more in my conclusion—Butcher offers her readers access to a very difficult work by emphasizing a reader’s centrality as well as the text’s essential intellectual greatness.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Like Butcher, Elizabeth Fuller Goodspeed—known as “Bobsy”—was a cultural arbiter in the city. Goodspeed had studied in Paris, and from 1932–1940 she was president of the Arts Club. This important gallery, where Goodspeed invited Stein to speak, introduced Picasso, Duchamp, Brâncuşi, Legér, and many other artists early on to Chicago. (Goodspeed’s husband, Charles “Barney” Goodspeed, was also a public re in Chicago; he was a Republican Party leader and a trustee of the University of Chicago [<span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 10].) A few other Chicago women played a role in Stein’s visits, including Alice Roullier, a gallery owner who organized the Arts Club exhibits, who was half-French, and who had traveled with Butcher to France and first met Stein and Toklas there, and Maude Hutchins, the wife of the University of Chicago president. Adopting Stein’s terminology, one could say that it was a group of American “wives” who first became enamored of Stein. Stein made a clear distinction between husbands and wives, describing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> how Alice sat with “the wives of geniuses” and she conversed with the geniuses themselves, the men.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> But in Chicago, gender played out differently: it was the wives who positively adored her. Stein would later voice conflicted feelings about the ways in which widespread fame, which now included this feminized readership, both overshadowed her work and inhibited her usual flow of writing. However, at the time of her tour, as she recounts it, she fully enjoyed the attention she received from the nationwide press—it had been a long time coming—and in particular from this group of Chicago women.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Stein’s presence also seemed to encourage more than usual intimacy and playfulness among these women, especially as they performed in front of the camera (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> and <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>). In photographs from a dinner party at the Lincoln Park apartment of Bobsy and Barney Goodspeed, where Stein and Toklas stayed for several nights, the women are  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">crowded together on a sofa, framed by men, as they pass around a flower that duplicates the flower in the Bernard Boutet de Monvel portrait of Bobsy Goodspeed above them. The large, free-standing film lamps in the photograph were set up for the short film that Bobsy Goodspeed made of the party, in which the women are visibly laughing. The Goodspeed home, designed by David Adler, housed paintings by Picasso, Calder, Matisse, and another portrait of Bobsy by the American impressionist Martha Walter. <a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Goodspeed wears a dress that resembles the one she wears in the portrait, and she flirts with the flower held to the nose of Richard Bokum, Fanny Butcher’s future husband. The self-awareness evident in these photographs—the play with surface representation and identity—tapped into Stein’s own aesthetic, as if the women have picked up on the indirect charm of a writer who constructs an autobiography from the point of view of her lover. The photographs also reveal the associative force between Stein herself—who sits on the sofa—and the aesthetic of her work, as mimicked by Bobsy Goodspeed.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Stein’s more experimental writing—like her long poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> —was similarly attentive to visual compositions in its playful, punning, and yet serious fashion. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> (which was published during Stein’s lifetime and thus available to Chicago readers) contributes to a larger modernist movement clearly embraced by Bobsy Goodspeed in the design of her home. Through a combination of sexual tropes, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> concludes:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The care with which the rain is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    This passage might function as a descriptive tag to a home filled with modernist art, in the sense that the colors and subjects of this art may be technically “wrong” and yet the art is composed with emphatic “care.” Modernist art aims not for verisimilitude but a fidelity or “justice” to what is represented, which is a different kind of “likeness.” The interior, feminized spaces suggested by <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span>, like the Goodspeed home, are spaces of domestic comfort and freedom, where there is “a chair and plenty of breathing.” Both realms—literal and poetic—toy with the energies of men: in the photograph, the men are on the fringes; and in the poem, the power of the phallic asparagus and fountain is created and—with humorous juxtaposition—subverted.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In fact there is some speculation that these women were open to exploring lesbianism, a point that emphasizes continuity from Stein’s contemporary readership through her promotion within fields of gender and sexuality studies today. In a letter that Stein’s friend Bernard Faÿ wrote to her in 1934 to encourage Stein to visit America, he describes Bobsy Goodspeed as “the lover of the wife of the president [of the University of Chicago].”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> That unnamed wife would be Maude Hutchins (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>), whose beauty was legendary and whose turbulent marriage of twenty-seven years ended in public catastrophe when Robert Hutchins left her in 1948 for his much younger secretary. Maude Hutchins then became a writer of sexually provocative novels, many of which dallied in lesbian fantasy.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Although there is no evidence other than Faÿ’s letter that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Maude Hutchins and Bobsy Goodspeed were lovers, it is fair to say that Stein and Toklas met a particularly receptive group of women in Chicago, who seemed very much attracted to Stein’s gender drag and her performative humor. Consider for example Stein’s inscription in a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lucy Church Amiably,</span> gifted to Bobsy Goodspeed: “For Bobsy, Lucy Church Amiably is amiable but Bobsy is so sweet and kind and we we like that kind of yes we do like that kind.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Or Stein’s inscription in a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> presented to Richard Bokum after he and Fanny Butcher, married: “For Dick not bunkum but Kokum for Dick Fanny’s Dick.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Who knows whether Goodspeed, Butcher, and Bokum understood the double entendre of Stein’s “kind” but they certainly would have known the coarse meaning of “dick.” These inscriptions and others amused Bobsy Goodspeed to such an extent that she collected them in a small private press book that she had printed for Christmas presents in 1934, and which Stein also sent as gifts, sometimes even inscribing her book of inscriptions<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). “Steinish,” as the papers called it, was a compelling language for the Goodspeeds’ group of Chicago socialites. Tantalizing with repetition, Stein had a way of saying and not saying it.

	    Apart from inscriptions, the playful repetitions in Stein’s writing were not perfectly clear to all of her readers in this cultural milieu. Fanny Butcher knew that most of Stein’s books were not suited to the marketplace, and she admitted in her diary to not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> understanding Stein’s more experimental language. The confusion that Butcher felt in regard to Stein’s work is worth looking at in detail, since Butcher’s response suggests two things: that the difficulty of Stein’s writing is different from other kinds of modernist difficulty, and that readers often respond to Stein’s work like they respond to Stein herself. Butcher at first treated Stein’s work as if she needed to decode its meaning but as she encountered more of Stein’s writing, and Stein in person, Butcher shifted her approach, enjoying on her own terms Stein’s work without needing to master it. This shift certainly has something to do with Butcher’s early aspirations as a student and her eventual authority as a literary critic and editor. But Butcher’s response also mirrors the responses of many readers who sensed that Stein’s work posed a subversive challenge to the very experience of understanding itself or to models of reading institutionalized by the university.

<p>
	    Butcher was someone both trained by the University of Chicago and also attuned to a wider culture of <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> readers: her response to Stein clarifies different modes of reading Stein’s work. Butcher read Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> when she was a sophomore at the University of Chicago but she did not read it for a course—Stein’s work was not then taught in literature courses there. Butcher was given <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> by a mentor whom she met at a Thursday evening salon hosted by a Viennese woman in Chicago (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 413–15). Butcher described the reading experience much later in her autobiography: “I couldn’t understand it, but neither did I understand Estonian, and I  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> felt that, if I could just learn the rudiments, I would have no trouble with the alien Stein tongue” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 416). This admission emphasizes both Butcher’s ambition and her desire to cultivate an appreciation for legitimate avant-garde art emerging from Europe. Stein’s language, however, is not compared to French or Italian or Latin; it is like “Estonian,” that is, outside of Butcher’s familiar linguistic terrain but accessible if she can simply “learn the rudiments.” It is writing with future potential. With the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, Stein made her writing more accessible to readers like Butcher; she exposed herself to what might be called “middlebrow” taste in the sense that the term frequently connotes an appeal to an aspiring class, especially a feminized, consumerist readership, or is pejoratively applied to works that are “accessible versions of avant-garde experiments.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Butcher’s position on Stein’s writing may reflect an enthusiasm for a style that she was beginning to understand, that she felt she <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> understand. Alternatively, her response may also indicate that she knows something unusual is at work in Stein’s texts—some quality that her University of Chicago education did not train her to recognize, the “moving” language of interpretive openness. Standing outside of the academy, in the case of reading Stein’s work, might actually aid her enjoyment of Stein’s “foreign” prose.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Many modernist texts require readers to decipher, translate, and connect elements to make meaning—to treat the text impersonally and analytically. Take, for instance, T. S. Eliot, who was becoming a literary authority whose work was lionized in the academy at the same time that an academic readership was resisting Stein. His work is exemplary both because of its allusiveness—impersonality thus defined as the submersion of self in quotations, fragments, and masks<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a>—and because of Eliot’s own claim in “Tradition and the Individual Talent”  advocating the impersonality of the artist. “The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality,” Eliot writes, suggesting that critics should not aim to find the artist or the artist’s “emotions” within a literary work. “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion,” Eliot writes, “but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The impersonality promoted by Eliot and carried forth as a major modernist tenet considers literature as a kind of science in which complex emotions are concentrated through language into something that is not an emotion at all. Contradictory in essence, as Sharon Cameron has recently argued, the concept of impersonality yet depends upon persons; it is not personality’s opposite. Rather, impersonality— “as a practice, as an ethic, as a representation,” in Cameron’s words—is “a penetration through or a falling outside of the boundary of the human particular.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> That is, to advocate impersonality—or to treat a text impersonally—is to see it as detached from <span style="font-style:italic;">particular</span> individuals. To recognize a text’s impersonality is to understand that the experiences it represents extend beyond the historical limits of a particular individual—the author’s or the reader’s.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Though Stein’s texts have been read as impersonal, they also have long been read in ways that privilege the experiences of Stein and her readers over anything else the work might impart. The reactions that Stein’s writing elicited are closely tied to readers’ reactions to Gertrude Stein herself, to how they read her as a particular person. And  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein’s writing is difficult partly because as a person she was difficult to read. Remarkably, however, confusion with Stein’s work did not necessarily limit a reader’s pleasure, an enjoyment that came from being quite pleasantly disoriented by it, and by Stein herself. Over twenty years after first reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> but before she wrote lavish praise for Stein in her pieces for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span>, Butcher privately described meeting Stein at her country house in France in 1931 and confessed to not “getting” everything that Stein said. “There lives with [Stein] a strange, over-feminine woman whose name is, I think Alice Toutless,” Butcher writes in her diary, “She attends to the household affairs and serves the plates at table, and coquettes with the guests and quotes Gertrude Stein’s best mots to Gertrude Stein and the guests.” Butcher then describes Stein reading aloud from her own work: “I suppose I looked a little vague,” Butcher admits, “because she read it again and said ‘Do you get it?’ I didn’t, but I said I did because I hadn’t guts enough to ask her to <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> me get it.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Butcher conflates Stein’s domestic partnership with Toklas with Stein’s writing: both, to her, are strange. It would seem that Butcher might at this point abandon Stein’s work—not having understood it in college or later in Stein’s presence—but what happens instead is that Butcher finds a way of appreciating Stein’s writing without “getting” it and without fully “getting” Stein. Indeed, the aggressiveness of Stein’s question to Butcher (“Do you get it?”) is contrary to Stein’s more typical indirectness (both in writing and in conversation), as if Stein really asks the question to her American visitor with the full knowledge that her writing cannot be “got.” The more that Butcher reads of Stein’s work and consorts with Stein herself, the more she allows for the idea that “something of the feeling”—as she writes later in her review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>—can dominate the reading experience.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The Chicago newspapers—especially the society pages—are full of responses to Stein similar to Butcher’s. Many people frankly admitted to not understanding Stein while nonetheless enjoying what she had to say. Judith Cass of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> describes “Miss Stein” as someone “whom all . . . have met . . . like and admire but whose writing no one I know even pretends to understand.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Another <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writer describes the effect that Stein and Toklas had on the crowd at the Chicago premiere of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints In Three Acts</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      Perhaps never before . . . was there so little attention paid to the lovely ladies in the boxes, for short-haired, simply gowned Gertrude Stein was the center of attention. Her longsleeved, high-necked gown of a dark plum color completely overshadowed the colorful and gorgeous gowns of her feminine neighbors, although the huge pendant gold earrings of Miss Toklas did cause many to glance her way.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Even as Toklas often appears in the papers as Stein’s “friend and secretary”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> or inaccurately in Butcher’s memoir as Stein’s “childhood friend” (<span style="font-style:italic;">ML</span>, 411), there is clearly a way that Chicago understands Stein through a reading of her sartorial manliness. She is distinctly not “feminine” with her “short hair” and “high-necked gown,” a description that functions as a surface sign of her sexual difference. But Stein’s sexuality is comprehended in a way that is never made explicit, expressed as a “feeling” about  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> things rather than something definite. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writer here knows that something meaningful is happening in Stein’s presence but she is unable to state exactly <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> it means: is Stein simple (“simply gowned”) or is she complex (“a dark plum color”)? The description of Stein at the opera is also a description of Stein’s very prose: pleasure is found in it even as it is not clear what is signified by Stein’s reversals and visual play.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Bennett Cerf, Stein’s editor at Random House, knew that the American public needed a primer on how to read most of Stein’s texts and he encouraged her immediately on arriving in America to appear on Pathé Newsreels, a program shown in movie theaters across the country. For this short publicity film, Stein gave an overview of the lectures she would give, suggesting that her listeners would understand her if they allowed themselves simply to enjoy the experience. “My lectures are to be a simple way to say that if you understand a thing you enjoy it and if you enjoy a thing you understand it,” she says in the film. And then again, she states, “Understanding and enjoying is the same thing.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Stein’s use of gerunds suggests that comprehension of her texts is not fixed, but moves with potential like the very American language she celebrates. Associating enjoying with understanding—as unfixed and unstable—becomes a recurrent theme; in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> , the work that Stein wrote after her lecture tour in which she grapples with her new celebrity status, Stein writes:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      They ask me to tell why an author like myself can become popular. It is very easy everybody keeps saying and writing what anybody feels that they are understanding and so they get tired of that, anybody can get tired of anything everybody can get tired of something and so they do not know it but they get tired of feeling they are understanding and so they take pleasure in having something that they feel they are not understanding 
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 126).
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Stein suggests that readers are tired of having literary texts explained to them, perhaps tired of having to approach literary difficulty in an analytical fashion. Readers want to forego the work of understanding Stein’s texts in favor of sensation, the feeling of Stein’s rich word associations rather than an analysis of what the text “means,” as if meaning could be pinned down as a static quality.
	    </p>
<p>
	      This approach to reading Stein’s work is exemplified by recent critics who uphold the centrality of a reader’s experience of Stein’s distinctive language, and by practitioners of language poetry who see Stein as an important model. For instance, Juliana Spahr—both critic and poet—argues that Stein’s “polylingual grammars” shift the emphasis of reading away from a “single inherent meaning” instead allowing a reader “multiple strategies of response”: “Stein’s works allow a decentralized self-governance and autonomy on the part of the reader by giving the reading act as much authority as the authoring act.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Though it is unclear whether Stein ever would have wanted her own presence as author to disappear—a point to which I will return—her statements above about how to understand her work suggest that she was open to various readings apart from finding neat or right or even clearly articulated responses to it. Stein here welcomes personality, both hers and her readers, as a governing force in the interpretation of her work.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      What differentiates the wider public’s response to Stein from the academic community’s response, which I discuss next, is a readiness to accept pleasure without textual understanding—or rather, to accept Stein’s suggestion that this pleasure is its own understanding. The difficulty of Stein’s work did not necessarily demand that readers decipher its meaning but rather it allowed them to simply enjoy it as a sensation, and this held true for the lectures that she gave in Chicago. For many of her listeners—whether they could be called the cultural elite or the middlebrow—it was Stein’s humor and music that emerged from her difficult use of repetition, disconnected syntax, and nonstandard grammar. Furthermore, though the style of Stein’s American lectures is innovative and arresting, like a dress of “dark plum,” the arguments themselves are “simply-gowned”; they are not particularly complicated. For instance, in her lecture “What Is English Literature” (which she gave at the Arts Club), Stein claims that that glory of English literature comes from the fact that England for hundreds of years had the stability and wealth to sustain writers and a reading public. She traces a trajectory from Chaucer to the twentieth century by way of the continuous “daily island life” that characterizes the greatness of the country’s literature. She does not advance a theory of literature here that explicitly challenges conventional thinking. Moreover, Stein’s argument is kept in broad terms. Stein does not flaunt her erudition or burden her audience by making them feel as if she is teaching them something. She teaches them what they already know. Stein’s lectures appealed to an American public who wanted access to a famous writer at the center of the modernist movement in Paris but who would provide for them recognizable ways of thinking about writing and art. Stein amused the women who organized her visits and indulged her huge auditorium audiences: she was what the middle of America wanted an avant-garde artist to be.

<p>
		  Stein wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures for the University of Chicago while she and Toklas stayed in Thornton Wilder’s Hyde Park apartment on their third and longest stay in Chicago. The women circled back to Chicago on their tour—it was their hub—and the centrality and energy of the city deeply influenced the four lectures. Though the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures expand on the themes of the lectures that Stein gave earlier and elsewhere (published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures in America</span>) they are different in that Stein registers her sense of change in American culture as she was seeing it after thirty years away. Stein emphasizes the vitality of the American idiom as she read and heard it in advertisements, newspapers, road signs, slang, and local conversations. Her sense of fresh, compelling, modern language is not solely tied to “What is English Literature,” as she titled her earlier lecture, or is it even tied to literature at all. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> demonstrate a shift in Stein’s thinking about writing, especially, as I will argue, about the audience for it and the value of her writing over time. At the University of Chicago Stein confronted men with very strict claims about literary greatness, and her conflict with them reveals that she wanted her works to be read not just for their “feeling,” which would allow personality to govern literary interpretation. She also wanted them to be impersonal, to contain ideas that stood on their own and stood the test of time, but not ideas as defined in academic terms. Soon after her American tour in a 1935 lecture titled “What are Master-Pieces and Why are There so Few of Them” Stein goes so far as to claim that a masterpiece exists outside of a reader’s particular experience of it.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The reasons for Stein’s reconsideration of the role of reading emerge in looking at the criticism that some of Stein’s contemporaries voiced about her work and the history of her debate with them. Though the University of Chicago serves as a sharp counterpoint to Stein’s popular reception, and refined her judgment of what was exciting about American writing, ultimately Stein did not wholly reject the university’s approach to literature and they did not reject her. English department faculty voiced ambivalence about her <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures even as they decided to publish them; and Stein disagreed with the men of Great Books even as she latched on to their idea of greatness and transformed it with her difference.
		</p>
<p>
		  Unlike her literary model Henry James who on returning to America in 1904 after twenty years abroad was appalled by the “alien” influences eroding the English language, Stein found that the mobility and lack of convention in American life (the lack of a “daily island life”) fostered the most dynamic developments in twentieth-century art and literature.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> She emphasizes in her first <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture “how the pressure of the non daily life living of the American nation has forced the words to have a different feeling of moving” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). Her description of American English is also an advertisement for her own, which is to say that her readers might experience her language as a kind of pleasant sensation, a “feeling of moving.” Stein suggests that American English is naturally less tied to tradition, and she connects her own purposefully nonstandard English with the innovative spirit of her home country that she was re-encountering with such pleasure on her tour. And in her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture, Stein’s emphasis on the movement of American writing takes the form of rejecting classical narrative structure, that is, “a beginning and a middle and an ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Whereas Aristotle argues that the construction of plot—by means of a beginning, middle, and end—is the most important feature of tragedy, Stein challenges the representation of time as indicated by a natural order of cause and effect. Stein is more interested in a constant middle—in the sense that the middle points in directions before and after—than she is in beginnings and endings, which are fixed in time, and signal a work’s wholeness and completion. Stein celebrates the dynamic openness of the most important experiences that writing should register, which “exist” rather than “happen”—for example, “Love” is the example she gives in her third lecture (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 38–39). Her aesthetic essentially embodies the very qualities that she witnesses in Chicago, that is, constant movement, shifts in direction, a sense of all things as present, open, and possible.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		  The University of Chicago Press and the university’s English department were not impressed by Stein’s creation of a language that has “a different feeling of moving” or by her lectures in particular. Thornton Wilder convinced the University of Chicago Press to publish Stein’s lectures in 1935—<span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> was the only work of hers that they published—but faculty who read the manuscript beforehand for the press were not supportive of the project. Professor Robert Lovett from the English department writes in his report: “Briefly, I do not agree with my colleague’s, Mr. Thornton Wilder’s, appreciation of these utterances. I think, however, that they may be properly published as part of literary history. Gertrude Stein is a fact, as Dadaism is a fact, and records of both ought to be preserved.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Lovett’s use of the word “utterances” suggests that he is unable to separate Stein’s writing from Stein’s performance: he reads text and person as one, as did Fanny Butcher and other <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span> writers. Another English department professor, Edith Foster Flint, writes that although she enjoyed Stein’s lectures when she first heard them, the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> left her with “a feeling of extreme irritation.” “I can see no virtue whatever in the manner of expression,” Flint writes, “And the ideas conveyed—so far as I am able to penetrate to them—do not seem to me so profound or novel as to necessitate, or warrant, the creation of a new medium, to me a grotesque medium.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Flint—like crowds of Chicagoans—found enjoyment in Stein’s performance but not in a more analytical reading of Stein’s texts, a reading framed by the values of an English department composed almost entirely of men.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Lovett’s and Flint’s strong responses highlight a moment when the categories that define Stein’s literary reception—between elite, middlebrow, and institutional, between women and men, between popularity and obscurity—explicitly break down. Moreover, the readers most resistant to Stein’s work were paradoxically also the ones who, in the end, were as invested as Stein in the concept of literary value.
		</p>
<p>
		  The re in whom all of these objections to Stein found their greatest force was Mortimer Adler, who had come to Chicago from Columbia University in order to establish a Great Books program (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). Like Wilder, Adler had been hand picked by Robert Hutchins in his first year as president. Hutchins wanted Adler to help him reform the undergraduate curriculum. But unlike Wilder—who was very popular at least with students—Adler was not well loved at the university, and like Stein, he was somewhat of an outsider to it.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Many faculty members were opposed to Great Books, preferring instead the implementation of what was called “The New Plan,” a two-year curriculum culminating in comprehensive exams across four fields: biological sciences, physical sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Students then went on to specialize in a particular field.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> But Hutchins—who team-taught Great Books with Adler—became even more convinced that Great Books was something that undergraduate curriculum should include because it favored classical training over more recent developments in the arts and sciences. Hutchins’s polemical 1933 convocation speech decried the emphasis put upon specialization: “The gadgeteers and the data-collectors, masquerading as scientists,” Hutchins said, “have threatened to become the supreme chieftains of the scholarly world.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> When Stein visited the University of Chicago, the debate over liberal arts education versus specialization was still very hot—it was a debate stemming  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> out all over the country—and she hit a nerve when she questioned Adler and Hutchins about their undergraduate program.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>
		  One infamous evening during a dinner party at Robert and Maude Hutchins’s home, Stein got into a very heated discussion with Adler and Robert Hutchins. The party took place on November 27, 1934—before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lectures—during Stein’s second visit to Chicago (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 342). According to Adler, Stein was “infuriated” by the idea that Great Books were read in translation; “She said that great literature was essentially untranslatable.” Adler describes how he and Hutchins “tried to argue with her, pointing out that we were concerned mainly with the ideas which were to be found in the Great Books. She might be right, we admitted, that fine writing suffers in translation, but ideas somehow transcended the particular language in which they were first expressed.” Apparently Hutchins elaborated, explaining that “the idea of justice” is the “same idea whether it is discussed by Plato in Greek, by Cicero in Latin, by Kant in German, or by John Stuart Mill in English.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Stein remained unconvinced, which prompted Hutchins to invite Stein to their Great Books class the following week. Stein writes to Van Vechten: “[B]ut this is a dead secret nobody knows that I am going to do it.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> So it happened that Stein—unannounced to anyone—showed up to teach the Hutchins and Adler class, a two-hour discussion of Aristophanes and epic poetry (Rice in <span style="font-style:italic;">GSTW</span>, 343).
		</p>
<p>
		  What happened in that class? And more generally, why did Stein show such resistance to the Great Books program and Adler such resistance to Stein? Before offering  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein’s reaction to teaching Great Books and her own account of the dinner debate with Adler and Hutchins, I would like to outline several issues that emerge from Stein’s distinctive critique of Adler’s program. Overall, her clash with Adler reveals her complicated response to literary reception, to being favored by a popular audience including the women of Chicago rather than by a university crowd that was mostly men, even as that university was making changes to become less specialized and broader in its curriculum. Stein also quite likely had a problem with the pedagogical stiffness of Adler’s approach, his humorless aesthetic, and his rules guiding “how to read a book.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Moreover, Stein had her own sense of how her work should fit—and was fitting—within a canon of English literature. She almost definitely knew that Adler did not allow room for her, especially since the works on his syllabus when she taught from it did not include any works originally written in English or written by women.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> That is, despite Stein’s ability to play the “short-haired” man, her gender was clearly an impediment to inclusion in his literary canon. Finally, Stein did not believe in ideas in the same sense that Adler did, or rather, she had conceived of a different way in which her works contained ideas. She maintained, on the one hand, that ideas could be a kind of feeling—an experience in language—rather than a position to be debated in class. (And of course to argue that a text is untranslatable is to commit oneself to the experience of its particular language, not to its ideas, as I will discuss more fully below.) Yet Stein also maintained, on the other hand, that apart from an author’s or a reader’s experience of a text, the ideas were still there. Stein both celebrated personality as a governing factor of literary interpretation (how one “feels” a text) and she also argued that personality is absent from what makes a text great.

<p>
		  By her own account Gertrude Stein had an entertaining time teaching Great Books students. In a letter she wrote afterwards to Van Vechten, she admits to “immensely” enjoying the course because “they teach by talking.” She writes to him: “they are interesting students and they say good things to you and they catch you up and it goes hammer and tongs pretty well and I liked it I like it a lot, it lasted almost two hours and I guess a good time was enjoyed by all.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Stein was a great talker: her problem with the course clearly had nothing to do with this classroom experience at the University of Chicago. Stein’s recollection of her time at Radcliffe in the 1890s, however, suggests that she would have been suspicious of some basic pedagogical methods of university teaching. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, Stein describes her inability to take an examination in William James’s philosophy class, instead writing him a note saying, “I am so sorry but really I do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy today.” According to Stein, James wrote her back the next day to say that he understood “perfectly how you feel” and he “gave her work the highest mark in his course.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Learning, for Stein, came about through experience, not through test taking or right and wrong answers. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, she writes: “To me when a thing is really interesting it is when there is no question and no answer, if there is then already the subject is not interesting and it is so, that is the reason that anything for which there is a solution is not interesting” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 220).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		  Whereas Stein emphasizes what is “interesting” and how a reader might prioritize pleasure rather than a stable “solution,” Adler seeks the fundamental ideas that writers of Great Books put forth, or as Stein describes his aim, he wanted to find “all the ideas that had been important in the world’s history.”<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Indeed, Adler spent years compiling a list of ideas that the Great Books supposedly contain—102, according to him, catalogued and cross-referenced in his 2,428-page appendix with the title, “The Syntopicon.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Stein’s description of her heated discussion with Adler and Hutchins emphasizes why she does not believe in the concept of ideas as espoused by the Great Books program. Stein believes that ideas about identity are much more interesting than the “sociological or government ideas” that can be extracted from Great Books, catalogued, and debated in a class. This is not to say that Stein was an introvert or solipsist—hardly the case— but that much of her work explores a relationship between language that is a “feeling of moving” and identity that is unfixed. She describes her conversation with Adler and Hutchins in a long passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    What are the ideas that are important I asked him. Here said he is the list of them I took the list and looked it over. Ah I said I notice that none of the books read at any time by them was originally written in English, was that intentional I asked him. No he said but in English there have really been no ideas expressed. Then I gather that to you there are no ideas which are not sociological or government ideas. Well are they he said, well yes I said. Government is the least interesting thing in human life, creation and expression of that creation is a damn sight more interesting . . . real ideas are not the relation of human beings as groups but a human being to himself inside him and that is an idea that is more interesting than humanity in groups . . .

<p class="continued">
		    What Stein means by “inside” is central to understanding her disagreement with the Great Books men. The word occurs frequently in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, most memorably in the passage where she describes her first bout with writer’s block after returning to France from America:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      Nothing inside me needed to be written. Nothing needed any word and there was no word inside me that could not be spoken and so there was no word inside me. And I was not writing. I began to worry about identity. I had always been I because I had words that had to be written inside me. And now any word I had inside could be spoken it did not need to be written. I am I because my little dog knows me
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 66).
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      Stein here connects her identity with the language “inside” of her: writing is identity come to the surface. Stein’s writing is “inside” language made visible and public; identity thus becomes outwardly recognizable in that her dog knows her. This writing—words “that could not be spoken”—is different from speech, which Stein uses more practically. She understands her relationship to written words in terms of their capacity to define who she understands herself to be: writing mines the origins and creation of the self, taking the form of puns, dislocations, associations, and rhythms of the English language to emphasize formation and development. Stein’s problem with Adler is thus not only intellectual but also aesthetic, in the sense that she believes literary greatness  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> should include the language of movement and fluidity that is the direction American literature (specifically hers) is going.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Furthermore, Stein likely objected to Adler and Hutchins’s claim that ideas like “justice”—as purely a “sociological” or “government” idea—can transcend the text. As a point of contrast, the final words of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span> (“The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain”) conre “justice” in context of the poem’s celebration of domestic, artistic, and sexual re-inventions as suggested by the poem’s verbal play. That is, justice depends on how one reads “likeness”; it depends on how one reads “asparagus” and “fountain”; it depends on juxtapositions within the text itself. Stein’s “justice” is also framed by the historical moment of the text’s production: the poem’s challenge to masculine power, to heterosexual conventions, and to representational art is particularly sharp when considering the text’s 1914 publication. But one point to notice about the very term “Great Books” is that it emphasizes books, not the people who wrote them or the cultures out of which the texts emerged. The course was not referred to as “The Great Philosophers.” Adler believed that Great Books offer a reader a deeper awareness of “the great and enduring truths of human life.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> The truths endure; the authors do not. One can find meaning in Great Books—at least in the way that Adler and Hutchins taught them—divorced from their historical and biographical contexts. But Gertrude Stein’s very idea about the origins of language suggests that it would have been very difficult for her to separate her “inside” from the texts that she wrote.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In Stein’s case, the book that made her into a popular literary re—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>—was impossible to isolate from biography and history, because the book itself was the story of Stein and Toklas’s life together, centering on their artistic salon in Paris and their relationships with such res as Picasso, Matisse, and Hemingway. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is a kind of twentieth-century local history, not a work in which Adler’s ideas would be embedded. Stein’s prose in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is relatively easy and bears resemblance to conversation, capturing the fact that she surrounded herself with people who would listen to her talk. If the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> puts forth any ideas, then they are so caught in situation and conversation as to be unrecognizable outside of the context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>. This book that made Stein famous—and which is still the book that keeps Stein selling—is a book that by Adler’s standards would not be called great.
		    </p>
<p>
		      However, some would argue that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> is not representative of Stein’s real stylistic innovations, and not a work that best represents Stein’s ideas. If its language is more like spoken than written English, then by Stein’s own terms it is not a book about what lies “inside” of her, a fact that she playfully acknowledges by positioning the work from Toklas’s point of view. The prose is certainly very different from other pieces that Stein wrote—for instance, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span>, which Stein was writing simultaneously while she wrote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, as an antidote to the more accessible prose.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> (And whereas the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> was a bestseller, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> was not published in full until after Stein died.) Perhaps the more experimental language of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> is the better example of a text through which Stein realizes ideas “inside” of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> her, which is to say that reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> is an experience of understanding the work- ings of language, its openness, and creative potential. Consider for example the poem’s final fourteen lines:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
		      Why am I if I am uncertain reasons may inclose.
		    <br>
		      Remain remain propose repose chose.
		    <br>
		      I call carelessly that the door is open.
		    <br>
		      Which if they can refuse to open
		    <br>
		      No one can rush to close.
		    <br>
		      Let them be mine therefore.
		    <br>
		      Everybody knows that I chose.
		    <br>
		      Therefor if therefor before I close.
		    <br>
		      I will therefore offer therefore I offer this.
		    <br>
		      Which if I refuse to miss can be miss is mine.
		    <br>
		      I will be well welcome when I come.
		    <br>
		      Because I am coming.
		    <br>
		      Certainly I come having come.
		    <br>
		        These stanzas are done.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      The title <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> includes the Italian word for “room” and thus the open door in this final stanza extends the poem’s metaphorical space. The long poem may “close” and be “done” but the “I” wonders whether she can be “certain” of herself if there are many uncertainties, if the “door is open,” questions “remain,” and there is promise of more to “come.” Stein refuses an ending to a poem that emphasizes the flexibility of “I” as it flexes the capabilities of language. Furthermore, with the gentlest gesture to a sonnet sequence, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> also suggests development, the building of each poem or stanza upon the former through repetition and rhythm rather than narrative chronology—a beginning, middle, and end—or specificity of application. That is, the meditation is available to all of us. Stein of course upholds the idea that her writing is applicable to everyone in her autobiographies—as emphasized in the title of her second, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span>, as if despite the particularity of her life, everyone can understand a narrative of change and development. <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span>, however, is not like her autobiographical narratives: what she achieves by writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas</span> from the “inside” is an exploration of the formation of identity not at the level of chronology and event but at the level of the structure of language.
		    </p>
<p>
		      The lack of particularity in much of Stein’s more experimental work, despite Stein’s play with proper names and references to her own life, informs a persuasive critical account of Stein’s work that emphasizes its impersonality and runs counter to a reader-centered approach. This understanding of Stein’s language has roots in Stein’s desire to have her works considered great, or in her own words, considered to be “master-pieces.” For instance, Jennifer Ashton argues that Stein herself insisted “on the autonomy of the work of art precisely by refusing any relation whatsoever between the work and anyone who might experience it, including the author herself.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Readers may respond to Stein’s work idiosyncratically, but according to Ashton, “their responses and experiences have nothing to do with what makes it art.” Ashton challenges a model  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of reading that advocates the subject position of both poet and reader to inform the meaning of the text, citing language poets like Lynn Hejinian and Susan Howe, who “turn to Stein as their mascot.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> To read a text impersonally, a reader’s “experience” cannot be equated with a text’s meaning. Stein herself suggests this approach to reading in a lecture that she gave on returning to Europe soon after her American tour, titled “What are Master-Pieces and Why are There so Few of Them.” Here, she offers an explanation that contradicts her earlier claims both about a reader’s pleasure and a writer’s “inside.” Stein maintains that a literary work is “no longer the property of the one who wrote it” and exists because it “came to be as something that is an end in itself and in that respect it is opposed to the business of living.”<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Stein’s shift in how she thought about literary texts suggests that she was less worried about <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> her work was known before she became a celebrity, but once she was assured that people knew of it, she wished that judgments of literary value not be predicated on the contingencies of a reader’s experience, or “the business of living.” But the very word “master-piece” reveals that Stein could never fully give up on the idea of a “master”—that is, an actual person—behind the work of art. The title of the lecture also indicates that her time in Chicago with the Great Books men continued to preoccupy her: she did not reject the idea that some works transcended others but she created a very different set of criteria to judge the distinction of “master-piece,” criteria that would naturally include her own writing.
		    </p>
<p>
		      The work that Stein promoted most aggressively as a masterpiece was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>, completed in 1911 but not published until 1925, a text to which she dedicated an entire lecture during her American tour and advertised again in her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture. Her claims about its literary value also reveal her vacillation between different modes of how this “master-piece” should be read. In her lecture “The Gradual Making of the Making of Americans,” Stein describes how she aimed to embody in this novel the uniquely American experience of temporality, “a space that is filled with moving, a space of time that is filled always filled with moving.” She explains that the long paragraphs, repetition, and sheer length of the novel were to enact “just how many seconds minutes or hours it is going to take to do a whole thing” which “everybody knows who is an American.”<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Her second <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture also explains the novel in terms of its relationship to time, in this case time that rejects Aristotelian narrative structure: “A great deal perhaps all of my writing of The Making of Americans was an effort to escape from this thing to escape from inevitably feeling that anything that everything had meaning as beginning and middle and ending” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 25). Her exegesis promotes reading as an experience—an experience of time’s “wholeness” or suspension rather than an artificial wholeness indicated by two points in time with a defined middle. But she also suggests in the first lecture that she wanted <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> to be a work that could be read impersonally: that by describing in the novel “every kind of human being that ever was or is or would be living,” Stein writes, “the enigma of the universe could in this way be solved.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>, according to this latter claim, offers readers an absolute conception of humankind, not an occasion for an experience in atemporality. Stein thus defines literary value both in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terms of a reader’s experience and a text’s intellectual stake in the “enigma” of human beings—that is, in different “kinds” of identities. And if <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> puts forth ideas, then they are not fixed ideas as Adler would have catalogued them, for Stein’s writing, as she describes it, is “always filled with moving.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      Adler’s and Stein’s accounts of their quarrel at the Hutchins’s dinner party will illuminate one final point about Stein’s aesthetic, especially as it relates to the issue of translation. Adler clearly did not recognize that Stein’s critique of his program, though serious, was also marked with humor, which both Stein and Toklas used to goad him. At the end of the evening as the party was breaking up, according to Adler, Toklas turned to him and said what I quote as an epigraph: “This has been a wonderful evening. Gertrude has said things tonight that it will take her 10 years to understand.” Adler remembers these words as if they are the final say on Stein. But in fact Toklas’s comment embodies Stein’s explanation of how to “understand” her language: enjoy the fact that its meaning is not fixed, that it will take more time to appreciate. Toklas is not patronizing Stein behind her back, she is celebrating Stein’s aesthetic. Stein did not speak straightly—straightness was never her style—including when she questioned Adler about translation. “Ah I said I notice that none of the books read at any time by them was originally written in English,” as Stein writes in her account, “was that intentional I asked him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EA</span>, 212–13). As many knew, Adler himself spoke no languages other than English—Stein did—and as someone herself on the fringes of the academy, she would have known exactly how to tweak Adler’s intellectual insecurity.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Stein did not actually have a problem with translations of literary works. She may have disagreed with Adler’s handling of translation—he famously did not consider the quality of the translations he promoted in his Great Books courses—and this would chafe at Stein’s attention to the materiality and pleasure in the experience of language. But Stein herself translated texts into English and promoted translations of her own work. Several books of hers were translated into French during her lifetime, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span>.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> An excerpt of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> also appeared in French translation.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Like many modernist writers, Stein may have understood translation to be an essentially generative and creative act, not an exercise in merely imparting a text’s essential content as Adler treated it.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Or Stein may have recognized, on some level, that her language was already a translation of sorts. That is, “Steinish,” as the Chicago papers called it (or “Estonian” for Butcher), was the product of being surrounded by foreign languages for her entire life: from the languages of her German-Jewish parents and her early childhood years in Paris and Vienna through the cosmopolitan environment of her Paris salon. Though she rarely wrote in French (despite living in France for thirty-five years), her English was undoubtedly influenced by her immersion in a European polyglot, an experience that helped to clarify her own linguistic aims. Stein’s familiarity with foreign vocabularies made her sharply aware of the texture and nuance of the English language, especially its rhythms, and she sensed in Adler someone entirely inattentive to its complexities.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Stein did not buy into the Hutchins and Adler program but these professorial men—and the contrast she felt between her mainstream audience and a masculine  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> university culture—emphasized a difference between popularity and literary posterity. Stein agreed with Adler’s conviction that only a limited number of books were great: she simply would have included her works and many other works on the list. Englishlanguage writers, women writers, and most importantly, according to Stein, modernists with her aesthetic should not be excluded from a definition of what constitutes a “master-piece.” Though the English department found her lectures akin to Dadaism, Stein traced her writing back through an English canon that includes, as she sketches it in “What is English Literature,” Austen, Dickens, Swift, Gibbon, Pope, Johnson, Milton, Shakespeare, and Chaucer (among others). As she frequently proclaimed of herself, she was a “genius,” the kind of rare re whose work transcends the ages. “I should think it makes no difference,” she writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span>, “That so few people are me. / That is to say in each generation there are so few geniuses.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> Stein’s objectives during her lecture tour in America—in Chicago and beyond—included recognition at the most prestigious American colleges and universities. She welcomed institutional fame.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      Moreover, one of Stein’s most frequent explanations for her use of repetition was that she wanted her writing to transcend time. In the 1920s she coined the term “continuous present” to describe her first attempts to escape chronological narrative structure, a strategy put to work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans.</span><a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> And in one of the last interviews she gave before she died, she said: “If time exists your writing is ephemeral. You can have a historical time but for you the time does not exist and if you are writing about the present the time element must cease to exist.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Stein wanted to write a book in which historical temporality could be suspended and something else could come to the forefront—not an idea by Adler’s definition, but an idea in the sense of a reader’s experience of “existing” in time, a reader’s sense of the formative power of language. But the fame that Gertrude Stein experienced in the 1930s changed her; it forced her to question herself “inside” and thus to question the source of her creativity. Writing came very easily and plentifully to Stein before her lecture tour, but fame as she described it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody’s Autobiography</span> and elsewhere was the source of her extended writer’s block.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> An aesthetic that conflated language with identity would naturally be challenged when identity was the subject of public scrutiny. In her third <span style="font-style:italic;">Narration</span> lecture, Stein in fact criticizes how newspapers misleadingly order events, giving a false impression of what has happened, and turning events into yesterday’s news. Newspapers often overlook the more important aspects of “existing,” Stein argues, including no doubt the event of her own existing in America. “I said newspapers make things too easy,” she writes, as if America’s influence on her and Stein’s influence on America is too diffuse for a newspaper’s conventional narrative structure (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37). And in the last lecture, she comically understates the impact of her “adventures” with American audiences, which were much bigger and more varied than she had ever expected, and which fundamentally shaped Stein’s literary aesthetic. “I have really found out quite a good deal about what an audience is,” Stein says, “by a simple series of adventures with it” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 47).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
			Was Stein an “invincible force” or was she an “immovable object,” as Fanny Butcher remembers her? The parallelism of Butcher’s sentence points to Stein as the “force” but the ambiguity of Butcher’s metaphorical language also foresees Stein’s presence and absence in the critical reception of her work. Even if Stein’s personality continues to exert itself upon how her work is read, Stein has also been treated as an object, in the sense that many literary, political, and cultural movements have claimed her as one of their own. Her <span style="font-style:italic;">autobiography</span>, as she somehow knew, is <span style="font-style:italic;">everybody’s</span>. Indeed, the status of Stein’s readers, the approaches to reading Stein’s texts, and her ideas about translation are as many-sided as Gertrude Stein herself. Though her “adventures” in Chicago emphasize ostensible divisions among classes, genders, and geographies, her ability to move among so many different kinds of readers—and appeal to them with her “moving” language—in fact breaks down these very divisions.
		      </p>
<p>
			As the Great Books philosophy gained nation-wide attention and was promoted as a curriculum in which ordinary men and women outside of the university could participate, it also became a movement with cross-over appeal, especially as it drew in readers dubbed middlebrow.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Dwight MacDonald—one of Mortimer Adler’s most vehement critics—widely criticized Great Books for being “Midcult,” that is, a bastardized version of High Culture that could be bought in a fifty-four-volume set.<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> And in his essays criticizing Great Books, MacDonald lumped Gertrude Stein into his example of what kind of art, in his terms, constitutes highbrow culture.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> But the uniqueness of Stein’s work and its reception, as I have been suggesting, fundamentally challenges many distinctions that might be drawn about the nature of her modernism.
		      </p>
<p>
			Mortimer Adler, too, is a difficult man to categorize. At one point—and this is a deeply ironic fact—he was alleged to write in a style very much like Gertrude Stein’s. These two adversaries superficially appeared to be much closer than they would have acknowledged. One folder in Adler’s voluminous and uncatalogued archives concerns the publication of a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> , which Adler wrote and Maude Hutchins illustrated (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). (She was at the time still married to Robert Hutchins.) It is a strange, provocative union of image and text. Hutchins’s line drawings of androgynous naked res in positions that suggest Greek gymnastics give one an indication of her future novels, prolific in their exploration of sexual fantasy and lesbian desire. Adler’s prose pieces, on the other hand, have titles like “Axiom,” “Topic,” “Description,” and “Analysis.” Here is the part titled “Analysis”:

			  Random House published <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> in a limited edition three years before Adler met Stein. <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine, not surprisingly, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> a “bewildering book” and then closed its review with this description: “To hardboiled booksellers <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span> last week recalled Jacob Epstein’s sketches . . . and the literary monotones of Gertrude Stein.”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> Adler replied in a livid letter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine, “I don’t know whether you offend Jacob Epstein and Gertrude Stein as much as you do us, by comparing us to them or them to us. The comparison could only rest on the fact that all the things you don’t understand look alike.”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> Adler suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span>’s readers lack discrimination; difficult prose is all the same to them. What he misses is the reality that many of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> readers who read <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine would also embrace Stein and find pleasure in her work though very few bought <span style="font-style:italic;">Diagrammatics</span>. The emptiness of his prose—driven by logic, sheer content, and no form—is very different from the richness of Stein’s wordplay, which enrolled a wide audience into her modernist aesthetic. Adler in his letter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> thus has a very good point: his prose only superficially resembles Stein’s. His purely logical claims lack the humor and associative power of Stein’s language and there is little sense of the person who lies behind Adler’s propositions. To compare Stein’s prose with Adler’s is to emphasize the difference between a style that is attached to its maker and one that is not, a style associated with the personality of the author and style that seems to have no particular person behind it.
			</p>
<p>
			  In looking at how popular audiences welcomed Stein’s work, it becomes clear that it was virtually impossible for them to remove Stein herself from the text. A persuasive approach to finding meaningful pleasure in Stein’s work, as I have argued, continues to rely on personality as a governing factor—both Stein’s and a reader’s. And yet, another approach to reading Stein’s work is to treat it as if Stein the writer is not there, to read it like one should read Adler’s propositions, impersonally. I would like to conclude with a famous response to Stein’s work that conjoins these two theoretical approaches, whose historical and sociological underpinnings, I have argued, should be prioritized in our critical understanding of Stein’s work. After Yale University Press published its last posthumous volume of her work in 1957, John Ashbery reviewed <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> for <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> magazine. His review is titled “The Impossible,” which suggests the extent of his admiration for Stein: she did what no one else had done. “The poem is a hymn to possibility,” Ashbery writes, “a celebration of the fact that the world exists, that things can happen.” <a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> What is remarkable about Ashbery’s wry praise is that he also could be describing, in Mortimer Adler’s terms, what constitutes a great book: “it is usually not events which interest Miss Stein,” Ashbery writes, “rather it is their ‘way of happening,’ and the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stanzas in Meditation</span> is a general, all-purpose model which each reader can adapt to fit his own set of particulars.”<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> The non-specificity that Ashbery emphasizes—the way that the text offers “a general, all-purpose model” rather than being contingent upon a particular history or the writer’s “inside” story— is near the justification that Adler gives of what makes a book great: it lasts through the years because it applies to everyone; it is inexhaustible. But Ashbery also suggests that each reader can adapt the text to “his own set of particulars,” which is to say that a reader can bring to bear his or her personality upon the text, rather than working to locate its fixed ideas, its essential meaning. Although Ashbery’s sense of adaptability is not exactly the same thing as accessibility, these qualities are related, as Stein herself knew. To feel that you can adapt a work of art to your own life is to have some real kind of access to it. The aim is not total comprehension or mastery—which Stein’s texts in fact challenge—but a sense of a text’s possibility.
			</p>
<p>
			  Stein’s profound influence on later writers—on Ashbery, for instance, and on twentieth- and twenty-first-century poetry more broadly—is proof that her writing has achieved some of the qualities that define a great book, not by Adler’s standards but by her own. Though <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span> established her celebrity  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> status, her more experimental work, paradoxically, has had equally strong staying power. Stein’s visits to Chicago during 1934 and 1935 illuminate different approaches to reading Stein’s texts among the city’s various audiences, approaches that continue to dominate our theoretical understanding of Stein’s work today. Her time in Chicago clarifies how and why she oscillated between groups of readers, between the concept of reading as an experience and reading as a pursuit of ideas. Stein was charmed by the attention that she received in America, particularly by her intimacy with Chicago’s literary women and by the enthusiasm of the crowds at her public lectures and at the University of Chicago. These experiences strengthened Stein’s sense of the literary standard she wanted to achieve: “moving” language that was open and mobile, much like the city of Chicago itself.

			    Many recent studies of modernism have taken issue with Andreas Huyssen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</span> (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986) and the critical accounts of modernism as mainstream are now quite numerous. Most relevant to my argument is Karen Leick’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gertrude Stein and the Making of an American Celebrity</span> (London and New York: Routledge, 2009), which usefully details the response of the American press to Stein and her work—although not Stein’s response to it. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gertrude Stein, Modernism, and the Problem of “Genius”</span> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), Barbara Will also argues against a division between high modernism’s investment in artistic “genius” and democratic tendencies in Stein’s writing.

			See Steven G. Yao’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Translation and the Languages of Modernism: Gender, Politics, Language</span> (Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002) for the argument that many modernist writers (Pound, H. D., Yeats, Joyce) understood translation as a mode of literary production in and of itself. Stein’s relationship to translation, as Barbara Will argues, was typically creative and rarely literal, except in the case of her translation of Philippe Pétain’s speeches.
