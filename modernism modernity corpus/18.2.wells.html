<h1 class="sec-headA">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados:</span> from Joyce to Herbert Ashbury</h1>
<p>In 1935, Jorge Luis Borges published his <span style="font-style:italic;">Historia universal de la infamia</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span>) with Tor, the popular Buenos Aires publishing house. With its cheap editions and graphic, color-saturated covers, Tor was a natural choice for this motley collection of capsule biographies of tricksters, assassins, and thugs from different parts of the globe. Here, Mark Twain's <span style="font-style:italic;">Life on the Mississippi</span> was juxtaposed with Sir Percy Skye's <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Persia</span>; Argentine and New York gangsters volleyed for attention within a single, slender story. On one hand, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span> stages what will become Borgesean signatures; in the lack of hierarchy and sense of accumulation that organizes the stories, for example, it anticipates his beloved encyclopedia. On the other hand, this minor work represents not only his first attempt at fiction, but also his most sustained engagement with mass media, both popular journalism and Hollywood films.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> If, that is, the collection anticipates the globally-renowned writer of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> erudite essays and speculative <span style="font-style:italic;">ficciones</span>, it also represents a unique moment in his own relationship to writing, the market, and the materials of a burgeoning culture industry.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Before being gathered together and published in 1935 by Tor, the majority of these stories had been published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> ("Multicolor Saturday Magazine"), a cultural supplement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>, a newspaper that proudly proclaimed on its masthead "Largest South American circulation." A singular force in modern Argentine culture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> was responsible for publishing many of the interwar period's most famous writers, as well as incorporating into its elastic form a wide swath of genres, modalities, and geographic and historical referents. Borges not only published frequently in the newspaper's Saturday supplement from 1933–1934, he also co-directed it during those same years, and it is this dual role—as author and as producer, as it were—that I wish to explore here.</p>
<p>In his Prologue to the first edition, Borges diagnoses the formal strategies of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>: "Certain techniques are abused: mismatched lists, abrupt transitions, the reduction of a person's entire life to two or three scenes."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> This list describes not only specific elements of the stories, it also gestures at the context of their initial publication. <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>, their mass culture incubator, is characterized by just these elements: the composition of visual images saturated with colors; the "reductive" mode of its layout, privileging brevity over a sense of profundity; "mismatched" juxtapositions of spaces and times which lack, per modern journalism, connection to each other. Further cut up by subsections that bear the material trace of their presence in the Saturday supplement, the stories, like the publication in which they emerged, also borrowed from the emergent aesthetic of the cartoon, an effect further heightened by the color illustrations that initially framed them. As though to acknowledge and exploit this material position within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, in them Borges draws extravagantly from popular culture, including Eduardo Gutiérrez's pulpish <span style="font-style:italic;">gaucho</span> tales, Herbert Asbury's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gangs of New York</span>, and the films of Josef Von Sternberg.</p>
<p>Such strategies echo the project of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> to both tap into and shape emergent publics through the modalities and velocities of modern print culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> In fact, Borges' writings from the 1930s represent a moment in which he wrote for radically different publications and publics: from Victoria Ocampo's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span>, which introduced Latin American readers to Faulkner and Woolf, with its vision of an international community of elite intellectuals; to the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica;</span> passing through the women's magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">El hogar</span> and even a publication sponsored by the Buenos Aires subway system. In short, this is a moment in which Borges directly and frequently experiences the contingency integral to modern print journalism.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> His experimentation with different approaches, styles, and media, was profoundly linked to broader changes occurring in the rapidly expanding cultural milieu of early-twentieth-century Buenos Aires. Throughout the decade, he would test out different versions of his author-re, merging high and low, transporting materials from one context to the next. He successfully lobbied a reluctant Ocampo to let him write review of popular Hollywood films, for example, which began to appear in the third issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span>. In this role, he reviewed, among others, Von Sternberg's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Docks of New York</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Morocco</span> .<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Within Borges studies, this also represents a relatively undertheorized moment in his oeuvre. While he produced no "major work" during his lifetime—indeed, his writings critique this concept—this is doubly true for his 1930s texts. These are not readily understood vis-a-vis his earlier works of avant-garde poetry (especially <span style="font-style:italic;">Fervor de Buenos Aires</span>, 1923), nor his later, consecrated <span style="font-style:italic;">El jardin de senderos que se bifuran</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden of Forking Paths)</span>, later subsumed into <span style="font-style:italic;">Ficciones</span> (1941, 1944). Certainly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span> has not received the attention of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ficciones</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">El Aleph</span>, the collections that show Borges at his most confident, with stories polished to generate both narrative and speculative interest. In general, the text has tended to be read in terms of transition—as a gateway or threshold to the fully realized Borges. To read the work retrospectively, writes one critic, "is 'to recognize his voice' when this voice was still a sketch."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, the idea of practice, of the <span style="font-style:italic;">essay</span>, is central to my reading of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>, as well as to Borges' 1930s production more broadly. Yet, rather than think of the text teleologically, as a way station to the more compelling stories and essays that he will write in the 1940s and 1950s, I want to pause on the conditions of production, the text's engagement with its own "inevitable" historicity through the materials of mass culture, as well as its insistence that any writing and reading practice is indelibly bound up with the thick and messy particulars of context. As I hope to show, moreover, this text represents not only a point of inflection in Borges' oeuvre—itself shifting and highly experimental, in the most material sense of the word, during this period—but also an opportunity to theorize late modernism in Argentina, the strategies and practices forged in the wake of the earlier avant-gardes.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>As Julio Ramos has shown in his reading of José Martí, the emergence of modern, autonomous literature in Latin America is indelibly connected to the new language of journalism. For Ramos, Martí's journalistic writing speaks to the fragmentation of modern, urban life and, simultaneously, to the desire to shore up against these changes through an assertion of the autonomy of the literary: "The newspaper not only erects <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> (the <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> of traditional temporality) as a principle for organizing its themes … it also <span style="font-style:italic;">delocalizes</span>—even in its graphic layout of material—the communicative process," Ramos writes; "the newspaper achieved with its layout and ordering of language what the city was doing with its traditional public spaces."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> By the time Borges began to work as an editor for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>, the language of journalism and the newspaper's motley and non-hierarchal arrangement of information had long since been consolidated. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> finds a key precedent in the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Caras y caretas</span> (1898–1941), which up to that point had been the most modern, and colorful, periodical in Argentina. The scope of its distribution, however, coupled with its striking page layouts and graphics, marks <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> as unique; as its Saturday supplement, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> was to be folded into this larger effort, with Borges at its helm. Deeply involved in the process of selecting, editing, writing, and laying out the pieces that comprise this strange admixture of high and low, avant-garde and mass culture, he implicitly credits the Saturday supplement as a kind of education—a <span style="font-style:italic;">taller</span>, or workshop, for literature in the wake of the earlier avant-gardes. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>His contemporary and friend Ulyses Petit de Murat has described in detail their collaboration on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>. According to Petit de Murat, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>'s charismatic owner, Natalio Botana—"the William Randolph Hearst" of 1920s and 1930s Argentina<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup>—had hired him to direct the supplement and to search for a collaborator. Apparently, Botana was initially hesitant to approve Petit de Murat's nomination of Borges for this role; although an admirer of his work, he thought him too erudite and removed from the "sense of the popular pulse" that <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> was supposed to simultaneously embody and shape.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Linked to poetry, an anachronistic Buenos Aires that had little to do with the heterogeneous crowds of the city's main streets, and questions of erudition, Borges represented the antithesis of Botana's vision for the supplement, which located itself under the sign of the pleasure, brevity and velocity which characterizes modern journalism. Moreover, his collaboration with Victoria Ocampo's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span> (which debuted in 1931) seemed to suggest that Borges had found his place within literary journalism in Argentina, and it was far removed from the burgeoning reading publics which Botana had in mind.</p>
<p>The first issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>, with Borges and Petit de Murat as co-directors, debuted on September 12, 1933; over the next two years, the two writers would collaborate intensively on its production as editors, soliciting and selecting what would appear in the supplement, as well as penning various sketches and articles, correcting those of others, and working closely with those responsible for its page layout, graphic design, typography—or what has been labeled the "bibliographic code" of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>'s first publication.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The texts they solicited, edited, and wrote are deeply inflected by the processes that produced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>.</p>
<p>Before detailing the practices that produced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, Petit de Murat's memoir of these years takes a detour through a failed project: he describes Natalio Botana's plan to commission and publish a translation of Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. Botana, as Petit de Murat recounts it, had read Borges' early and partial translation of Joyce's novel in 1923.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> He subsequently encouraged Botana to choose Borges for the project, facilitating the connection between newspaper magnate and modernist writer. As luck would have it, this would-be translation was not to be; by telegram they learned that the Spanish translation rights had already been granted to another writer . This description of the failure to translate Joyce resonates with a number of other Argentine modernists who, anecdotally, recall a similar invocation and then swerving away from what had become a monument of high modernism, suggesting not only the presence and influence of Joyce within a certain history of experimental Argentine literature, but also the way in which his re was employed as a means of grappling with the failure in the high modernist project to <span style="font-style:italic;">take</span>—at least in its "pure" form, amongst late modernist writers in Argentina. If Botana, Borges, and Petit de Murat had dreamed collectively of a pocket edition of Joyce in Spanish—a dream the contemporaneous novelist Roberto Arlt had proclaimed would immediately devalue Joyce's symbolic stock within intellectual circles—they would content themselves with something quite different in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Natalio Botana's plan for the Saturday supplement was a marriage of literary "quality" and the ability to attract a grand public. Modeling it after the works of Horacio Quiroga—a professional writer whose chronicles and horror stories during the 'teens drew upon the new media of silent film—Botana proposed a journal that would be passionately modern, connected to the latest technologies and rapidly expanding reading publics, but also shot through with literature that would not immediately be conceived as popular: "agile, sensationalist, dynamic, informed, and enjoyable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 142). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> mixed notices of local literary prizes with brief sketches reminiscent of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripley's Believe it or Not</span>, stories of garish crimes, erudite theatrical reviews, and reports of unrest among railroad workers. In the pages that Borges and Petit de Murat will edit together, excerpts from dense essays of national interpretation (for example, the Brazilian Euclides da Cunha's seminal 1901 work <span style="font-style:italic;">Os sertões</span>) comingle with articles emphasizing the exotic, the grotesque, the excessive, and the eerie: "The Gypsies: a Wandering Race," or "Seven Generations of Bastards." It would seem that any description of the periodical necessarily invokes the catalog or the collage. In fact, the collection or "this-and-that" enumeration contained in such descriptions belies the sense of absolute leveling sustained by the Saturday supplement. The syntax of writing itself works against the effect of aggressive simultaneity in its pages; nothing in its lay-out or structure would indicate the differences among different types of text.</p>
<p>To examine the stories of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> in their original context is to be struck by the seamlessness with which Borges entered into—and, as editor, helped to produce—a low-brow and highly consumable collection of stories, sketches, and curiosities. In his memoir, Petit de Murat describes the malleability with which Borges adapted to a context that could not have seemed more alien. "Botana encouraged a special kind of editor: one who would go to the workspace, who knew by heart the catalog of type facing, the possibilities for titles supplied by the Ludlow [typesetting machine]. Borges had only spent time at presses where books were published, but he quickly adapted himself [<span style="font-style:italic;">se asimiló</span>] to the gigantic Hoe machines" . As editors of the supplement, the two writers spent hours at the printing press on Salta Street that specialized in color editions, forming friendships with the multiple workers involved in the various processes of type-setting, layout, and graphics that led to the journal's striking colors (140–1). Indeed, the issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">color</span> is crucial to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>; it proudly invokes its saturated tones, the result of the latest technological innovations, in its very title. The graphic mixtures of mustard-yellow, cobalt blue, and smears of red of the graphics—for example, in the striking covers, some designed by the Mexican muralist David Siqueiros during his controversial stint in Buenos Aires—suggests as well a negotiation between modern art and the modern public, between the simultaneous desire to strike the reader as new and modern, while not estranging him or her.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Rather than shock or defamiliarization, a marveling at the latest technologies that could make all the news, sketches, and chronicles that appeared within its pages punchy and fascinating, "the evening habit of thousands who lived in Buenos Aires" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 137). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>His dual role in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> inaugurated a shift in Borges' corpus. Out of his experiences with the Saturday supplement, the twin problems of time and labor emerge and press upon his writings. If the Borges of the 1920s had been one "who would ask for ten days to finalize a 15-line response to any survey" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 140), the latter would be characterized by a need to publish quickly and without nuance. The pain-staking labor of the earlier Borges, connected with the issue of free time to spend upon careful, even auratic editions of his first poems and essays, morphs into another form: that of the rapid-fire execution of mechanical reproduction. This new value of time and labor also implicates the materials of Borges' production, as well as its form: "We never dreamt that we would move from the modest, almost familial edition of our books and the small circulation of our little magazines, to a circulation like that of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 144). On this reading, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> moment constitutes a point of inflexion, in which the earlier avant-gardes' sense of a private and intimate circle, abstracted from the world, is exposed to the logic of capitalist life.</p>
<p>Yet what starts out as an imperative—a very real need to work and therefore publish in a variety of contexts and registers—becomes, for Borges, a strangely fecund moment of production. As editor, he had to think quickly, finish a page, edit in an instant an epigraph or reference to an author. If this was true for his role as an editor, it also seeped into his crafting of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>: "with a velocity he never before attained, without out the possibility of concentrating on elaborate changes (<span style="font-style:italic;">largas modificaciones</span>), Borges reads lives and then—as he himself has confessed—he modified (<span style="font-style:italic;">modificaba)</span> and distorted them according to his own fantasy, spurred on by the imperative to hand in originals."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> In this description, the repeated verb <span style="font-style:italic;">modificar</span> allows us to trace this shift in Borges' writing. Unable to engage in substantial editing of his own writing, he is "consigned" to retooling the works of others, but this in itself produces a new relationship to writing, one indexed in Petit de Murat's reflection by the shift in the two uses of <span style="font-style:italic;">modificar</span>. If at first the verb described the careful labor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">vanguardista</span>, with his emphasis on the singular aesthetic experience, it now describes the engagement with the work of others, the editor contaminating the writer, all of this mediated by the increasing tempo of a burgeoning culture industry.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Late Modernism, Argentina c. 1930</h1>
<p>Petit de Murat's emphasis on mechanical reproduction, and its attendant problems of labor and the use of heterogeneous materials, allows us to further interpret the shift that Borges' writings undergo during the 1930s, and their relationship to a broader problem facing his contemporaries. This decade is not a neutral one (if such a thing exists) in Argentine history. Retrospectively, it has been framed by a group of epithets that emphasize an acute crisis and ensuing melancholy: "the decade of the suicides," "<span style="font-style:italic;">los tristes treinta</span>" ("the sad Thirties") "the years of the great funerals," and, most famously, "the infamous decade." In addition to the global economic crisis, the beginning of the decade was tinged by political violence; in what was to be a pattern throughout the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> century, a military dictatorship overthrew a democratically-elected president. Scholars have subsequently interpreted the decade as marking the end of an era defined, at least partially, by the promise of progress and, concomitantly, liberal democracy in Argentina. Not limited to the economic or political, moreover, the crisis seemed to contaminate, or perhaps dovetail with, a series of epistemological and aesthetic crises.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> To a much greater extent than the First World War (which occurred, after all, "off-stage"), the 1930s mark a watershed in Argentina's modernism, and in its history more broadly: a state of emergency in which the literary and political, the social and the aesthetic, blur together under the overarching frame of crisis.</p>
<p>The end of avant-garde movements proper—and with it, the end of their particular, rupturist account of modernity—is part of this broader context, shaping the late modernism specific to Argentina. During the 1930s, the metaphors of birth, freshness, and the break with the past that had been so important to the earlier avant-gardes not only disappear but also seem to age: the mere idea of the new becomes old. In the 1921 "Ultraist Manifesto," for example, Borges had written that the aesthetics of Ultra demand the clearing away of older views and a gaze that saw the world as utterly new. The sense of an unformed world—"the poet is a small god," his Chilean contemporary Vicente Huidobro had written in his 1916 poem/manifesto "Arte poética"—is what will seem to be radically foreclosed during the 1930s. When, in the second Prologue to the 1954 edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, Borges links his strategies to the Baroque—"the final stage in all art, when art flaunts and squanders its resources" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span> 4)—he seems to invoke the melancholy exhaustion of the 1930s text, the sense that the new itself has become old, or spent, by the beginning of the decade.</p>
<p>Yet in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> we also find an interest in probing the limitations of novelty, a paradoxically productive resignation to this ceaseless recycling. In the wake of what seemed to be the failure of the earlier avant-gardes—the space-clearing gesture, a movement's production of the conditions for its own legibility, the entire logic of rupture that fueled the first wave of modernism—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> implies a new relationship between the writer and the materials that circulate around him.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> The intensity of the avant-garde self is recast as part of a larger, collaborative effort to produce and sustain the new reading publics, and consumers, identified with the interwar period in Buenos Aires. And, as Petit de Murat suggests with his emphasis on the machines and labor that made the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> possible, the artist gives way to the <span style="font-style:italic;">artisan</span>, in a trope that circulates in 1930s discourse in Argentina and beyond.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Rather than the demiurge or inventor which characterizes the earlier modernists, during this period Borges began to forge a definition of literature that will become his signature: not novelty but an endlessly renewable circuit of repetition and difference. My interest is to trace how this theory is made possible by his practice with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>.</p>
<p>Order and creativity, original and copy, rules and riffing, are tensions that will remain, from this point on, a constant in Borges' corpus, and we find them most acutely represented in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> through the language of mass culture.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In this sense, we can locate the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> within the late or otherwise mixed or hybrid  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernisms that characterize the 1930s, where the role of mass culture becomes increasingly prominent, entering into the literary form in simultaneously more explicit and vexed ways than in their high modernist precursors. In the words of Tyrus Miller, in his analysis of Anglo-American late modernism, Borges' experience with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> represents a moment of the "slackening of the critical tension between modernist art forms and modern society."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Late modernism, in Miller's analysis, increasingly traverses the high-low divide at a moment in which mass culture has become difficult to suppress, as authors increasingly "sought to bind the restless, disturbing collective energies of recorded music, fashion, advertising, radio, and film," in this way "expos[ing] to critical view the stigmata where mass politics and urban life left their forceful signatures" . While the increasing role of modern journalism throughout the nineteenth century already inaugurated the breach between art and the market in Latin America as well as in the U.S. and Europe, this anxiety becomes more acute during the interwar period, where the consolidation of mass culture—a term itself coined during the 1930s—becomes an increasingly explicit part of creative literature.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If the "modernist myth" from which, Miller argues, late modernist authors are forced to divest, must indeed be rethought in light of the particularities that shape Latin American modernism—for example, in its engagement less with Anglo-American modernism than with the Continental avant-gardes, and in its limited access to autonomous cultural structures—his taxonomy nevertheless offers us a compelling frame to consider the Borges of the 1930s, also engaged with different permutations of modernism in the wake of its initial, euphoric stage. In Argentina, a country whose peripheral status is not a hypostatized given during the first decades of the twentieth century, radio, film, and popular journalism contributed to the creation of new publics, even as the earlier avant-garde ethos of rupture was diminishing. This is not to make light of the differences between Buenos Aires and New York or London, but to suggest that Borges and Petit de Murat's experiences at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> suggest a similar struggle with the increasing presence of mass culture, both global and local, associated with the 1930s in the Euro-American context.</p>
<p>The Buenos Aires that Borges returned to in the early '20s, shot through with the products—aesthetic as well as technological—of a globalized identity, suggested an increasing <span style="font-style:italic;">simultaneity</span> at work, a simultaneity that would only continue in the decades to come. As in the case of silent film, radio was introduced in Argentina at nearly the same moment as in the U.S. and Western Europe; shortly thereafter, national film emerged as an industry, and the city featured a large number of movie houses. <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> itself was part of this modernity, "peripheral" as it might have been.</p>
<p>As such, I would argue that Borges' 1930s writings demonstrate a strategic incorporation, one which does not see emergent mass culture within Argentina as a threat to either high culture or <span style="font-style:italic;">cultura popular</span> ("folk culture"), but rather as an opportunity to reflect upon the avant-garde obsession with the new. As his reviews of popular films suggest, for example, the medium has the simultaneous potential to be radically innovative and utterly predictable. Writing in the wake of experimental cinema's impact on the literary avant-garde of Argentina, he encounters the newly consolidated studio  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> system of Hollywood, and a more general shift away from the cultural centers of Europe to an ascendant United States. In his film sketches, for example, he is interested in the ability of both classic Greek and "classic" Hollywood conventions to produce infinitely compelling variations from within a rather limited formal structure.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span> is the text where Borges most explicitly opts for a strategic use of certain metonymies of the Hollywood aesthetic. Rather than critique it as iron-clad structure, he adopts fragments of commercial film as one mode in a bag of tricks, one possible procedure among many.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> A particularly effective image can rescue a film from utter failure, as in his review of King Vidor's <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy the Kid</span> , which features an assassination whose indirection he finds powerful. The power of this indirection is not a metonymy of the film as a whole, which is, in his opinion, unsuccessful.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Rather, it is a strategic use that postulates the creation of something new through the otherwise impoverished materials of mass culture. In the process of borrowing from the novel techniques afforded by mass culture, Borges simultaneously deviates slightly from these, failing to fulfill the rules of genre or convention.</p>
<p>"The Disinterested Killer Bill Harrigan," Borges' version of Billy the Kid, is perhaps the most cinematographic episode in the collection. In his review of the King Vidor's film version of the same character, Borges had criticized the film's pseudo-epic sweep, deeming it the "that shameful chronicling of the twenty murders (not counting Mexicans) committed by the famous ter of Arizona, a film made with no other distinction than the accumulation of panoramic takes and the methodical elimination of close-ups in order to suggest the desert."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> On his view, Vidor's film works with a series of spatial clichés that suggest repetition without variation. His critique of the director, however, does not preclude him from initially borrowing his strategies. Indeed, his "Disinterested Killer Bill Harrigan" also proceeds by takes, beginning with the following "shot": "The image of the lands of Arizona, before any other image."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Rather than offering us a detailed realist description, the stage is set with the utmost brevity and efficiency, as though merely showing us what we can already see. Of course, given that the images are crafted on paper and not celluloid, we <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> see, and this inability presents one of many difficulties that interrupt the potential seamlessness of the story.</p>
<p>This "shot" is also crucial for the particular sense of narrative interest that would appear to be building in the story. After this setting of the stage, a re emerges: "Within this landscape, another image—the image of Billy the Kid, the rider sitting firm upon his horse, the young man of loud shots that stun the desert, the shooter of invisible bullets that kill at a distance, like a magic spell" . Later in the story, the narrator describes this method explicitly: "History (which, like a certain motion picture director, moves through discontinuous images), now proposes a sketchy saloon" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Historia universal de la infamia</span> 67). Manifesting a paradox central to film, history operates through discontinuous images, through interruption rather than flow. With this image, Borges suggests that it must borrow from its own historical moment—in this case, the moment of popular film, its transmutation of literary epic into visual spectacle—to make itself legible. Like the translators of <span style="font-style:italic;">The 1001 Nights</span>, in his oft-cited essay also first published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> , who "betray" their own  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> historicity in each rewriting of the tenth-century classic, historical form itself is nothing if not mutable, susceptible to historical change.</p>
<p>If, as Beatriz Sarlo has argued, film implies a more mythologizing and ultimately passive role for the subject in 1920s–1930s Argentina—as opposed to the more accessible and active subject formation of the radio—Borges suggests that tinkering with its materials offers another possibility.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Transporting them into an unlikely medium, the compilation of other writers' stories, he inflects his developing fictional voice with the new language of film. In the wake of a perceived failure to be new, he exercises his anti-novelties through sly appropriation. Moreover, as Borges presents him in his capsule biography, Billy the Kid is part of larger phenomenon taking place in Argentina and elsewhere: he represents a moment of the hero of <span style="font-style:italic;">cultura popular</span> or folk culture becoming an icon of mass culture. In the Latin American context, as Jesús Martín-Barbero has analyzed, this process has been located precisely within the 1930s. According to Martín-Barbero, it is in this decade when cinema and radio enact a bridge between popular and mass culture, through films and radio plays that resuscitate older forms—and here we might think of Billy as a re for the <span style="font-style:italic;">gaucho/</span> cowboy/outlaw—giving them new venues and modes of circulation.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Other stories in the collection—for example, in the gangster tale "Monk Eastman, Purveyor of Iniquities"—are also interested in marking this shift, the moment in which outsider res become consolidated into new technologies of circulation, distribution, and reception.</p>
<p>At the end of "Bill Harrigan," the wide angle shots that were supposed to signify <span style="font-style:italic;">desert</span> in King Vidor's <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy</span> are replaced here with literary close-ups of the protagonist. As though to seal the sense of performativity and borrowing from popular culture that marked Billy's entire life—"he felt no scorn for theatrical fictions: he liked to go to the theater (perhaps with no presentiment that they were the symbols and letters of his own destiny")—this hero ends up exhibited in a shop window, surrounded by spectators: "On the third day, they had to put makeup on him" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span>, 38, 41). As during other moments in the collection, the mise-en-scène moment of mass culture here refers us back to the history of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, its origin in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Billy's garish ending implicates the reader of these stories of infamy; reader and spectator mirror one another.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the story "The Improbable Impostor Tom Castro," Borges makes explicit reference to the reader in the opening sentence, which establishes the "return" of the title character to South America, "even if only as a ghost, or a Saturday pastime." In a footnote added after the stories were compiled as a book, the narrator states, "This metaphor allowed me to remind the reader that these infamous biographies appeared in the Saturday supplement of an evening newspaper" . The reference not only reminds us of the work's initial context of production in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, but also situates the itinerary of the trickster Tom Castro as part of a larger traffic between North and South. There is no reading without a location, Borges says; likewise, there is no writing of "history" that remains uninflected by the historicity of one's given moment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Universal Pulp History</h1>
<p>Writing in the Argentine journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Nosotros</span> in 1926, Alberto Fournier proclaimed what would become a commonplace for Latin American intellectuals throughout the following decade. Film, he wrote, "is not national, does not possess its own borders or languages that would form barriers"; it is "essentially international, penetrating all countries, all towns … from America to Oceania."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> A decade later, contemporary anti-kitsch and high modernist arguments put forth with the U.S. context in mind, most famously Adorno and Horkheimer's chapter on the culture industry in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dialectic of Enlightenment</span> and Clement Greenberg's "Avant-garde and Kitsch," critiqued the seemingly endless reproducibility of mass culture. Severed from any origin of labor, infinitely identical, the products of mass culture, they argued, were sheered of any historical density. They represented the nefarious side of novelty, linked to impermanence and surface (opposed to psychological depth, or historical rootedness).</p>
<p>For many Latin American writers during the period, the emergent phenomenon of mass culture was particularly threatening because of its potential to engulf both the national and the historical, to turn all times and spaces into its pernicious play of surfaces, under the logic of the U.S. model of production. Mass culture, in other words, was increasingly becoming a problem of globalization—a problem of the unequal distribution and reception of cultural goods, and of the increasing homogenization of daily life. As I have suggested above, in the context of an affirmative national culture in the face of an increasing Americanism, Borges opts for a strategic adoption of metonymies of mass culture, particularly in its globalized, U.S. centered forms, as in Hollywood film. Indeed, despite their invocation of a variety of spaces and times, the stories in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> are disproportionately weighted towards the U.S., as though to suggest the inevitable particularity that emerges in any claim to the universal. He therefore essays a "universal history" for the 1930s, as particular as any claims for universality, will necessarily be written with and through the materials of the culture industry, indebted to—or burdened by—an increasing U.S. presence.</p>
<p>In perusing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> we are struck by a lack a sense of historical or geographical difference; all subject matter is reduced to the same plane, with similar images and prominence. Even revered res of national history constitute just one of many possible narrative intrigues, written in the present tense and sheared of any historical density. A cover article published on December 23, 1933 by José P. Barreiro titled "Sarmiento, el ambicioso," for example, tells the story of Domingo F. Sarmiento, the nineteenth-century national hero, opening with the line, "He hid from no one the enormous ambition that consumed him": an ambition that the readers will presumably eagerly consume themselves, along with the protagonist, who here emerges as a kind of pulp protagonist. The pleasure that such narratives elicit also appears to aim, extra-textually, at starting the process of consumption over again, of purchasing another Saturday supplement.</p>
<p>The "history" that Borges lays out in the supplement's pages borrows the leveling effect of modern journalism, noted above, in this way submitting the collection's pompous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> title to a parodic critique. The Schopenhauerian strain that had marked his writings since his early years had liquidated any faith in the grandiose claims for universal history described, for example, in Hegel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Philosophy of World History</span>.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> In his critique of Hegel in <span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span>, Schopenhauer had posited that such overarching claims for history were based on a fundamental illusion, proposing an organic whole—"with beginning, middle, and end, together with a significant connection" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span> 444–5)—where none existed. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> participates in his larger suspicion of any overarching narrative with designs to subsume the world, with all its particulars. Instead, as in Schopenhauer, the text suggests that history is no longer capable of being didactic, pedagogical or, more generally, of having a transcendental meaning. In his recent critique of Hegel's persistence in contemporary historiography, Ranajit Guha writes that Hegel's was "a short story with epical pretensions."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In turn, we could call Borges' <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> the parodic inversion of the same: an epic of fragmented or truncated proportions.</p>
<p>In a text contemporary to Hegel's, also with pretentions to universality, Carlyle's <span style="font-style:italic;">On Heroes, the Heroic, and Hero Worship</span> , the author had created a typology of heroes chosen "out of widely-distant countries and epochs" .<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Carlyle explicitly chooses examples that will correspond to the seemingly vast scope of world history: a Norse semi-god, Mohammad, and Napoleon all share the stage, as though to illustrate the possibility of creating a universal through exempla. Borges was well aware of Carlyle's work; he would later write a Prologue to the first Spanish edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sartor Resartus</span> , and a parodic version of the Scottish thinker's method is apparent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>. In his rouges' gallery, Borges too chooses protagonists from a variety of historical and geographical contexts: early twentieth-century New York, medieval Arabia, dynastic Japan. Yet their utter lack of world-historical importance critiques the sense of plenitude that we find in both Hegel and Carlyle's conceptions of history. Instead, it is <span style="font-style:italic;">infamy</span>—etymologically, both "without fame," as well as "evil"—that lends the collection its only connective tissue.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> is not only without chronological order; it also lacks, in contrast to Carlyle's text, a sense of meaning that can emerge through the accrual of different stories. Moreover, in miniature, the collection's individual stories reflect its overall structure, in which elements are not linked together through either coordination or subordination. Eschewing causality, they counter the explanatory thrust of narrative that traditional historiography exploits: the slippage between <span style="font-style:italic;">this happens after this</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">this happens because of this</span>. That is, they reject narrative as explanation, as the "grasping together" that Paul Ricoeur has ascribed to it.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> As we have seen in the case of "Bill Harrigan," they are incomplete, somehow truncated, failing the promise of the <span style="font-style:italic;">terminus ad quem</span>.</p>
<p>In "The Terrifying Redeemer Lazarus Morell," for example, the title character's end lacks both poetic justice and poetic symmetry. An illegal slave trader with sadistic methods, Lazarus "liberates" slaves by killing them. In the section "The Catastrophe," the narrator has described in details the last days of this infamous character, as though they were leading up to a meaningful culmination. Lazarus "planned a response of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> continental proportions—a response in which criminality would become redemptive, and historic."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The phrase "continental response" should give us pause, resonating as it does with the collection's grandiose title. And, like it, Lazarus' project is doomed to failure. "The Interruption," the story's last section, undermines the crescendo that would seem to be building. First, in a counterfactual, the narrator lists possibilities that would have given this ending meaning and closure—"Morell leading uprisings of blacks who dreamt of hanging him; Morell hung by armies of blacks whom he dreamt of leading"—teasingly handing out possibilities for narrative closure. Next, he informs the reader that these contradict the story's proper ending: "It pains me to confess that the history of Mississippi did not take advantage of these splendid opportunities" . Morell dies of a pulmonary infection; slavery does not end in a desired inversion of roles.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> As I have noted above in the case of "Bill Harrigan," Borges here borrows intensity and condensation from Hollywood, subtly distorting its epic panning. Offering his readers consumable stories, he then fails to fulfill completely his promise, ending the story with a grotesque, specular, or emphatically banal image.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>"The endeavor to explain and interpret [historical events] directly is accordingly like the endeavor to see in the forms of the clouds groups of men and animals," Schopenhauer wrote. "What history narrates is in fact only the long, heavy, and confused dream of humanity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span> 443). In the Prologue to the 1954 edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, Borges describes his own book in similar terms: "Gallows and pirates fill its pages, and that word "iniquity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">infamia</span>) strikes awe in its title, but under all the storm and lighting, there is nothing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span> 5). Lacking an overarching architecture, the collection evacuates claims not only to universal history, but to any history as narrative fullness. Patchy and incomplete, it flaunts its large gaps. The miniature nature of the capsule biographies seems to cause the frame—that hefty and pretentious title—to collapse. While we in vain search for the "inside" of this universal history, we find only a piling up of colorful stories.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>The vision of history running through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> is both indebted to and subtly distanced from the Saturday supplement in which the work took shape. Despite the commonplace of both his contemporaries in interwar Argentina and by subsequent critics, Borges is not an author who flees from the history, but rather draws it into his work, which shows a preoccupation with how the shape and meaning of texts, and where and when they appear, are mutually constitutive.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> As in the epigraph that begins this paper, he understood works to be inevitably, if obliquely and often unintentionally, bound up with the problem of history.</p>
<p>We find this preoccupation, for example, in the difference between the Prefaces to the first and second editions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, both included in subsequent editions. In the first, which accompanied the 1935 Tor edition, Borges represents himself as a re-reader and retooler of texts, noting the particular procedures—the mismatched lists, abrupt transitions, reduction of a person's entire life to two or three scenes—which, I have shown, echo the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> in which they were published. In contrast, the second Preface, published in 1954 as part of his  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Obras completas</span>, emphasizes the philosophical stance that he will increasingly mine beginning with the essays in <span style="font-style:italic;">Otras inquisiciones</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Other Inquisitions</span>, 1952). While the first Prologue suggests a Borges who is grappling with a shifting definition of the author during a particular instance of late modernism in Argentina, the latter is the result of a writer increasingly interested in creating a body of work whose pieces fit together under a larger umbrella of speculative fictions and essays.</p>
<p>Yet, if we trace the work back to its first publication in the motley pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, we must recognize that even the very idea of Preface, as in the unit of the book itself, presupposes a unity belied by its initial context of production. Here, disconnected stories rub up against other sketches in different issues of the supplement, yoked together only by the absurd and pompous banner of the title, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span>. In fact, we could say that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> submits history itself to the processes of history, employing the languages of mass culture to allude to its attendant problems of new reading publics, globalization, and the increasing leveling effect of cultural goods in late modernism. Rather than position Borges as prophetically prering the language of contemporary theory then, we might take a cue from his own approach to reading, returning to the different contexts that shaped his texts, tracing their different itineraries, continually exploring how their meaning is generated with and through the shifting contexts in which they appeared.</p>

For the most synthetic historical account of the decade, see Tulio Halperin Donghi, <span style="font-style:italic;">La república imposible (1930–1945)</span> (Buenos Aires: Siglo Veintiuno 2005).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f19" href="#f19-text">19. </a>One symptom of this shift in modernism can be found in the waning of the manifesto as a genre, which essentially disappears in Argentina during the decade. On the specifically originary language of the manifesto, see Martin Puchner, <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry of the Revolution: Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-gardes</span>, especially Part I, 2–66.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f21" href="#f21-text">21. </a>In thinking through this problem with respect to art's autonomy in late modernity, A.J. Cascardi's "Mimesis and Modernism: the Case of Jorge Luis Borges" has been very helpful to me.

José Eduardo González has argued that the Borges who emerges in the 1930s and 1940s must be understood as a direct result of the author's grappling with the problem of modernism in the Third World. On Gonzalez's view, Borges' struggle with the two cultural realms which shaped him, the European avant-gardes and the Latin American turn towards regionalism during the interwar period, led him to seek out a "third way": a playful, fantastic literature that mined strategies of the former while not investing in its notion of difficulty, infinitely more playful and consumable. See <span style="font-style:italic;">Borges and the Politics of Form</span> (New York: Garland Publishers, 1998), 35, 72. I would argue, however, that González leaps too quickly between <span style="font-style:italic;">modernism</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span>—which leads his to the assertion that Argentina, or Latin American writing more generally, represented for Borges a conservative, traditional, or nativist mode, to be juxtaposed to an always "make it new" logic, ostensibly European. In fact, like many avant-gardists, both European and Latin American, Borges played with the idea of the "New World" as itself a source of the new, of rupture with the past.</p></div>

Joseph R. Barager. "The Historiography of the Rio de la Plata Area since 1930," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hispanic American Historical Review</span>, 39/4 (November 1959), 12. Borges' return to the scene of writing nineteenth-century modernity in South America—a scene that cannot but be written, he suggests, through and with Europe—has a double thrust: on the one hand, it revisits the violence that has made possible modern Argentina, but it also recasts this violence as story, narrative  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intrigue. As Sonia Mattalia notes, "Each of the seven stories that make up the book are divided into extremely short chapters that undress, make evident, the arbitrariness of nineteenth-century causality … exhausting its logic" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f40" href="#f40-text">40. </a>We might think of Borges' continually citation of fragments of his own work in different moments, at each step changing the meaning of the fragment in relationship to its location both within the work and within the world. See the way the same fragment is repeatedly recast in the essays "Sentirse en la muerte" , <span style="font-style:italic;">Historia de la eternidad</span> , and "Nueva refutación del tiempo" . The use of self-citation suggests, in this sense, a theory of literature that asks us to consider its constant shifts with and through history. The first scholarly monograph to tackle the problem of Borges and history is Daniel Balderston's <span style="font-style:italic;">Out of Context</span> (above), although Balderston's focus is on the stories post-<span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, and is more referential than my own. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
