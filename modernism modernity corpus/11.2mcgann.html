Neither Swinburne nor his writings are normal or ordinary. "Demoniac youth," Ruskin called him, and to Maupassant he was "the most extravagant artistic person alive in the world today."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Descriptions like that recur in the numerous contemporary reports, though many also express horror at the person Georgiana Burne-Jones called "the most poetic personality I have ever known."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  So Bayard Taylor observes that "I admire in him . . . the mad, unrestrained preponderance of the imagination. It is a god-like quality, but he sometimes uses it like the devil. . . . He told me some things, unspeakably shocking, which he had omitted from his last volume." (<i>CH</i>, 7) Excepting his love for children and old people, few things about Swinburne seemed "appropriate," to appropriate a commonplace of our preposterously careful and standardized age. He even looked odd. Georgiana Burne-Jones recalled "the flame-like beauty of his wavy mass of hair, his swift speech and extraordinary swiftness of thought and apprehension, and a certain delightful inconsequence all his own." Most "unforgettable" were his piercing green eyes and the ways he moved: "When repeating poetry he had a perfectly natural way of lifting [his eyes] in a rapt, unconscious gaze. . . . 'Looks commencing with the skies' expresses it without exaggeration. He was restless beyond words, scarcely standing still at all and almost dancing as he walked." (<i>CH</i>, 6)

<p>
The writings are as arresting as the man. He composed as easily in French as in English, and nearly as easily in Greek, Latin, and Italian. Probably Tennyson is the only poet after Pope who possessed his extraordinary prosodic and literary skills, and Tennyson cannot match the range of Swinburne's work. His critical 


<b></b>


and speculative prose, though still largely inviolate, is seminal and made Pater's and Wilde's work possible; he is a major writer of fiction, as Edmund Wilson would discover late in his life; and with his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he passed along to Ezra Pound a theory and practice of poetic translation that was crucial for the Modernist program. All this is accomplished within a clearly defined intellectual framework that was also, for him, a mission. He meant to establish the practice of Imagination at the center of cultural life. His idea of Imagination is Shelleyan&#x02014;that is to say, it is moral, comprehensive, and committed to social transformation. Also like Shelley, he directed his work to the arena of ideology and the forms of belief that society's ideological apparatuses, especially the schools and the churches, promote and maintain. But he is far more like Byron in seeking a broad public engagement with his secular humanism. He made himself and his work a sign of contention. 

<p>
He was fearless, immensely gifted, and unswerving in this work. But he was expelled from our schools in the twentieth century. The expulsion was understandable given the cultural program to which academic modernism devoted itself between approximately 1920 and 1965. Recent well-known revaluations of that program have begun to study its police-keeping work and restore attention to the true range of what is involved&#x02014;is still involved&#x02014;in modernism and modernity. In that context Swinburne's aesthetic program, both theory and practice, is a great, neglected cultural and scholarly obligation.

The Life
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In February 1875 the American poet and critic E. C. Stedman asked Swinburne for an account of his "birth and career." Swinburne was then the most celebrated (and excoriated) poet in England, and his fame on the continent and the United States was equally broadcast. 

<p>
The poet replied with a long letter&#x02014;an impressive example of his marvelous prose, and important as an index to the salient features of his life as he saw them or wanted them seen.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  The letter is a kind of mid-life Memoir written neither as an advertisement for himself nor as a scandalous confidence. For latter-day persons interested in Swinburne, it should probably be read before any other account of the man. While the letter refers to Byron several times, Swinburne is aware that his is not, like Byron's, an eventful life. What concerns him are ideas, writing (poetry in particular), and issues of character (especially as these descend to him through his family). With quiet verve Swinburne declines any "Rousseau-like record of . . . emotions." As to important dates he simply remarks: "knowing as you do the dates and sequence of my published books you know every event of my life." To this one might add only that Swinburne's unpublished work&#x02014;much of it even yet unprinted&#x02014;would also interest an interested person. 

<p>
Swinburne did not wake on 16 July 1866&#x02014;the day that his <i>Poems and Ballads</i> appeared&#x02014;to find himself instantly famous, as Byron had on the day <i>Childe Harold: A Romaunt</i> was issued in 1812. But the mixed blessing of his fame spread quickly from that day&#x02014;from that book&#x02014;forward. "A very great poet has arisen in England," the 


<b></b>


historian W. H. E. Lecky wrote to a cousin shortly after the book appeared, and "All literary London is now ringing with [the book's] genius . . . blasphemies and indecencies."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  He became a wonder, a terror, and finally a catalyst for great social and cultural change. Ruskin's ambivalence is worth recalling:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For the matter of it&#x02014;I consent to much&#x02014;I regret much&#x02014;I blame or reject nothing. I should as soon think of finding fault with you as with a thundercloud or a nightshade blossom. All I can say of you or them&#x02014;is that God made you, and that you are very wonderful and beautiful. To me it may be dreadful or deadly&#x02014;it may be in a deeper sense, or in certain relations, helpful and medicinal. There is assuredly something wrong with you&#x02014;awful in proportion to the great powers it affects, and renders (nationally) at present useless.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Most readers troubled by the book had lost such power of reflection. The <i>London Review</i> called it "depressing and misbegotten&#x02014;in many of its constituents. . .utterly revolting" (<i>CH</i>, 35). <i>The Athenaeum</i>: "unclean for the sake of uncleanness" (<i>CH</i>, 31). <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>: "mad . . . indecency" (<i>CH</i>, xx). And so forth. Swinburne's publisher (Edward Moxon) was so frightened by the virulence of the abuse that he broke off publication and passed the copies on hand to John Camden Hotten, who brought out five more editions. (At that point, 1875, Swinburne turned to a new publisher, Chatto and Windus, who would reprint the book no less than forty times between 1875 and 1916.) 

<p>
The scandalous success of <i>Poems and Ballads</i> is precisely the <i>text</i>onic center of "The Life of Algernon Charles Swinburne" both in its contemporary and in its posthumous unfolding. His life in letters was his life, as he told Stedman. But so shocking was the advent of this epochal book that it would come to obscure the range of Swinburne's work&#x02014;a range so extensive that one can sometimes scarcely imagine how it came to be thought narrow or precious.

<p>
To many the book represented the best that was known and being thought in the world at that moment in history. William Michael Rossetti, that steady and sane radical, spoke this point of view better than most:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Swinburne's superiority over his contemporary poets, with the sole possible exception of Tennyson . . . lie[s] in his mastery of all the literary or artistic resources of poetry. . . . As to blasphemy, Swinburne is certainly a pronounced antichristian, and something very closely resembling an atheist; I consider that he is right in entertaining these or any other speculative opinions which commend themselves to his own mind, and expressing them as freely as Christians, Mohammedans, etc., express their speculative or traditional opinions. As to indecency [I do not think] his writings are likely to do any practical harm to anybody fitted by taste and training to admire them.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The intensity of Swinburne's work does not encourage that kind of intellectual clarity, though in many respects it does assume it. In this respect&#x02014;as in some others&#x02014;Swinburne comes to his age as Jesus came to his, bringing not peace, but a sword. Unlike Rossetti, he took a mischievous delight in upending settled minds, as one sees 


<b></b>


in his superb comic, satiric, and parodic verse. Writing to Joseph Knight about the attack in the <i>Athenaeum</i> Swinburne says: "I have exhausted myself with a quasi-venereal enjoyment of th[at] incomparable article." (<i>PL</i>, 136) Rossetti wrote a judicious pamphlet in praise and defense of his friend, <i>Swinburne's Poems and Ballads</i>. Swinburne's reply, the unrepentant and derisory <i>Notes on Poems and Reviews</i>, simply institutionalized himself with his antagonists as the re John Morley called "the libidinous laureate of a pack of satyrs" (<i>CH</i>, 29).

<p>
Two other sets of events, the second following upon the first, dominate the mythology of Swinburne's life. In June 1878 Theodore Watts-Dunton, finding the poet in a desperate physical state, took him from his rooms in London to Watts-Dunton's house in Putney. The action probably saved Swinburne's life. His health had been deteriorating for some years, largely from his reckless abuse of alcohol. Stories about his outrageous public behavior were circulating from the mid-1860s, and gossip carried further tales of moral depravity. Many of his friends and acquaintances were notorious characters themselves, like Richard Monkton-Milnes, the sophisticated collector of strange books and strange persons and the man who introduced Swinburne to the works of Sade. Rumor had it (correctly) that Swinburne liked to frequent a certain brothel in St. John's Wood where flagellation was a specialty of the house. Swinburne was, it seems, never the worse for these visits, but his drunkenness was another matter.

<p>
Contemporary scandal grew rife during the 1870s and did much to convince a public mind that Swinburne was simply a diseased creature, body and soul. The disease took one form in Swinburne's writings and conversation, another in a disgraceful life, and the gathering set of scandalous events came to define the man and, through that definition, the work. To the practical friend and lawyer Watts-Dunton, however, Swinburne in 1878 was simply in mortal physical danger from his alcoholism. So he took Swinburne to his house and initiated what would come to be known as the Putney Years, which lasted till the poet's death in 1909. Admirers of Swinburne's work often bemoan the bland regimen that Watts-Dunton installed for his friend over the next thirty years, but few doubt that he saved the poet from untimely death. If his gift of imagination after the early 1880s shows a tailing off, as it does, the Putney Years nonetheless produced a handful of marvelous and even innovative works, and they left Swinburne the opportunity to set his literary house in order, which he did when he carefully prepared his 1904 collected edition of the poems and plays. 

<p>
To study Swinburne's personal life is to study a soul that looms strange even today. Such investigations doubtless have use, though they can impede our view of Swinburne's literary and cultural significance. Yet two distinctively personal matters are important even in the latter context.

<p>
First, Swinburne had a capacity for ecstatic, physical sympathy with elemental nature. His love of swimming and especially "the unplumbed, salt estranging sea" was boundless and it supplied him with a type of phenomenal awareness that is perhaps unique in English literature.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Only Ovid and Lucretius have left us equivalent literary records of the infinite, majestic universe that quantum mechanics would shortly begin to explore in functional terms.


<b></b>


<p>
Second, Swinburne was a quick scholar and a refractory student. He never finished his schooling at Eton or Oxford. What Captain Harewood says to his son Reginald in Swinburne's remarkable novel <i>A Year's Letters</i> (written 1861-1862) is brief and to the point: "you set at nought all guidance."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  His command of language, of many languages ancient and modern, was complete, and while he endured instruction in those quarters as a boy, he broke for independent study as quickly as he could. 

<p>
In intellectual matters Swinburne frightened and appalled partly because he was so formidably armed for discussion and dispute, and partly because he had&#x02014;as everyone reports&#x02014;a dauntless spirit. We want to remember that he set a face of flint against an immensely powerful ideological regime. Religion, in particular Christianity, dominated English society and culture in the nineteenth century, and England dominated the world. Those who chafed against these spiritual dominions hailed the lucid force of Swinburne's <i>non serviam</i>, which even yet has a majesty about it and continued importance. "Reckless and ungoverned" was the judgment of those who lacked his purpose "to follow knowledge like a sinking star/ Beyond the utmost bounds of human thought."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  He undertook that pursuit by plunge and engulfment. Knowing "at an inner stand-point" was how his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti described this kind of intellectual discipline.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  To think and to write from that vantage entails&#x02014;we see this clearly in Swinburne's writing&#x02014;the near complete disappearance, absorption or extinction, of Romantic subjectivity. Swinburne's work is Romantic but it is not subjective. 

<p>
All of this impinges directly on Swinburne's writing and cultural significance, as T. S. Eliot understood. In 1920 Eliot published a brilliant and influential critique of Swinburne's poetry in order to exorcise the demon of Swinburne's "genius," which remained at that time a commonplace word to describe Swinburne. "Only a man of genius could dwell so exclusively and consistently among words as Swinburne," Eliot observed. But because "Language in a healthy state presents the object, is so close to the object that the two are identified," Swinburne's language is astonishing but decadent: "merely the hallucination of meaning . . . language . . . uprooted."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  A superb sleight of hand returns us to the diseased Swinburne, the affront to "current notions of decency and dignity and social duty" (<i>CH</i>, 22). Those are John Morley's words in 1866. But the health of culture is always in jeopardy from unheard melodies and Swinburne was not a normal or ordinary poet. So against Swinburne's "morbidity of language" Eliot sets "the language which is most important to us [and] which is struggling to digest and express" itself in 1920.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In our hindsight we have come to understand the language prized by Eliot as "High Modernism": that is to say, a modernism as intent on purity as were the hostile reviewers of <i>Poems and Ballads</i>. Always a certain kind of purity. Gertrude Stein, key modernist though she is, did not write in Eliot's language, and her case is far from a special one.

<p>
Eliot's essay is a reading of Swinburne's "life" very much in the same spirit that the author lived it. Eliot reads him, that is to say, for his cultural significance. It is a highly critical reading&#x02014;as we should expect from a man who had his own (Anglo-Catholic) cultural program to promote. That was the center of his life. 


<b></b>


<p>
The reading that may be "most important to us" now, however, at a new century's turn, is perhaps Henry Adams's reading. Adams met Swinburne in 1862 at one of Monkton Milnes's famous dinner parties. Milnes had just "discovered" Swinburne, who had to that point published only some undergraduate work, a book of verse plays, <i>The Queen Mother and Rosamund</i> , and a few recent poems. No expectations, friendly or hostile, set Adams up for this encounter with the poet just coming into full command of his powers. Adams recounted the event in a book full of memorable passages and events, none more so than this one. Swinburne held the five dinner guests spellbound "far into the night, listening to the rush of [his] talk. In a long experience, before or after, no one ever approached it; yet one had heard accounts of the best talking of the time, and read accounts of talkers in all time, among the rest, of Voltaire, who seemed to approach nearest the pattern." Swinburne held forth with commentary and recitation, his own poetry as well as declamations of "a play of Sophocles or a play of Shakespeare, forward or backward, from end to beginning; or Dante, or Villon, or Victor Hugo." For Adams, it was like hearing a voice from "millions of ages" beyond them. The experience was a defining event for Adams and for <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> as well. In Swinburne Adams saw that a human being might possess the kind of cultural power he glimpsed in Dynamo and Virgin. His sense of his own insignificance set a measure for what Swinburne represented:



<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Adams could no more interest Algernon Swinburne than he could interest Encke's comet. . . . The quality of genius was an education almost ultimate, for one touched there the limits of the human mind on that side; but one could only receive; one had nothing to give&#x02014;nothing even to offer.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>
 

<p>
The comment and reaction recall Ruskin's. More to the point, they reflect a central feature of Swinburne's greatest poetry, which is intense, overwhelming, and&#x02014;as Eliot said&#x02014;"impersonal." The work comes as if overtaken by some transhuman force, with the poet&#x02014;in Swinburne's own words&#x02014;"Now no more a singer but a song." Ruskin judged that in 1866 the voice could scarcely be heard, was "(nationally) quite useless." At the limit of the human mind, millions of ages beyond Ruskin and Adams. Swinburne's subjects no longer terrorize, however&#x02014;"Thank Somebody," as he used to say.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  So the writing is there, unburdened, "free at last," and perhaps finally useful to tormented nations that long ago found a place for the tormented Ruskin.

The Writing
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Neither Eliot nor William Empson were so interested in the high artifice of a poetry like Swinburne's as they were in the artifices of sixteenth and seventeenth-century English verse. Nonetheless, these two exemplary English modernists understood the core features of Swinburne's work, though both warned people away from it "because" (Empson observed) "its effects depended on a tradition that its [own] example was destroying."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  He is speaking of the tradition of "Metaphysical" poetry. But as a long 


<b></b>


line of inheritors shows, Swinburne was for that tradition, as Shelley might have said, both "destroyer and preserver." When Eliot remarked upon the "impersonal" character of Swinburne's writing and its immersion in "words" and "language" as such, he was connecting Swinburne to a tradition that Veronica Forrest-Thomson would later recall and recast in her brilliant revisionary presentation of twentieth-century poetry, <i>Poetic Artifice</i>. Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were also conscious practitioners of the same late nineteenth-century revival of a poetic artifice they derived, in great part, from a study of Dante, Petrarch, and their "circles"&#x02014;and in Swinburne's case, from the classical tradition that supported and the Elizabethan tradition that studied them. To Empson and Eliot these derivations seemed enervated and "decadent." Late twentieth-century poets&#x02014;formalists like James Merrill and John Hollander as well as experimental writers like J. H. Prynne, Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, and Forrest-Thomson&#x02014;take a very different view. For them, Swinburne in particular is decisively important, even a kind of touchstone. 

<p>
"People are oddly determined to regard Swinburne as an exponent of Pure Sound with no intellectual content," Empson dryly remarked. But the truth is that "as a matter of technique" Swinburne "is full of subdued conceits and ambiguities," and as a matter of content, his sensibility was of the intellectual sort which proceeds by a process of analysis."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Empson is right on both counts, as he is also correct to suggest that Swinburne (like Byron, we might observe) inherited and honored a legacy that his own practice was putting through a metabolic shift. 

<p>
To recover Empson's clarity we might begin with the most apparent of Swinburne's intellectual frames of reference: his large critical-historical analysis of Western culture. This analysis centers in a broad study of the cultural damage that followed upon the institutionalization of monotheist ideas and of Christian ideas in particular. Because Neo-Christianities define so much of modernism, particularly academic modernism, Swinburne represented a key ideological antithesis&#x02014;and a special abhorrence because his views were so clearly articulated.

<p>
His Shelleyan/Hugolian thought is that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. As such, they regularly stand in opposition to what St. Paul called the "thrones, principalities, powers, and dominions" that seek to control and rule the world. A paradoxical historical inversion turned the Church that Paul helped to establish into Western culture's governing ideological dominion. 

<p>
This view of Christianity was shared alike by Blake, Marx, and Swinburne. But whereas Marx followed Hegel in seeking emancipation through the social enactment of enlightened thought, Swinburne pledged allegiance to Blake and aesthetic tradition, where forces of ideology could be most sharply engaged. Not without reason did he stake his philosophical ground in the enlightened action of Sade, Blake, and Byron&#x02014;emancipators whose "sincerity and strength," as Swinburne remarked, are as much a function of their tragedies as of their triumphs, and should always be understood in aesthetic terms.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Both Sade and Byron lived legendary and (in Shelley's sense) Imaginative lives, of which their writings are in a sense the sacramental signs.


<b></b>


<p>
Poetry is the chief means for securing "freedom" (a talismanic Swinburnean word and idea) from forces that darken the spirit. Like Shelley, Swinburne constructs a history of the world through a recovery of its poetical touchstones. So he sees the period between the installation of official Christianity at Rome and the re-emergence of classical, humanist, and even pagan culture in the Italian Renaissance as a long, dark age. The Borgias and Villon are thus exemplary historical res, forecasting the humanist pagan renaissance that captured the imaginations of so many nineteenth-century Europeans: Heine, Hugo, Baudelaire, Wagner, Nietzsche, to name only the most prominent. Sade, Blake, and Byron are also key historical res for Swinburne: recent prophets of a freedom they foresee but, because of their socio-ideological inheritances, cannot fully possess. 

<p>
Sappho is pivotal for several reasons. Her historical position signifies that the humanist ideal is literally primal&#x02014;the "true" Alpha and Omega that monotheists would later refashion as "the Lord." The sexual translation of primal imagination from motherhood to fatherhood was as significant for Swinburne as the fragmentary condition of Sappho's poetical remains, left in tatters by the long Dark Age of Christian worship. Equally important was the shift of primal power from a mortal poet, Sappho, to an immaterial idea, God. For Swinburne (as for Blake), the worst consequence of Christianity was the replacement of institutional religion for individual imaginative life at the center of human social and interpersonal exchange. Swinburne regarded Blake's <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> as the greatest poem of the eighteenth century in large part because it had recovered a core truth: that God did not make the world but that human beings "animated. . .sensible objects" as gods and divinities and later, literally benighted, fell down and worshipped their own imaginative creations. "Thus began Priesthood," as Blake observes, "Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales" (plate 11). Swinburne's remarkable study <i>William Blake</i> develops its theoretical polemic for poetry out of a complex meditation on those basic ideas. 

<p>
Swinburne's writing is fundamentally "about" writing, poetry, and language, then, as Eliot remarks. But as has been said of Georges Perec, Swinburne's life was lived through and "in words."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  From Swinburne's perspective, to be thus languaged is the opposite of an Eliotic "uprootedness." A poem like "Hertha" explicitly offers imaginative expression, including the poem's own expression, as "The tree many-rooted" (line 96) that encompasses all of reality. Two features of poetry are especially crucial. 

<p>
First are its Ovidian capacities for infinite metamorphic change and transformation. Poetry is what Humberto Maturana and Francesco Varela have more recently described as an <i>autopoietic</i> system&#x02014;a living form that maintains itself by a continual process of self-extrusion. Poetry's reception history sets out the record of that process and is itself an essential part of the process. Swinburne's writing practice is thus "performative" of an <i>autopoiesis</i> whose "growth [has] no guerdon/ But only to grow." The contemporary relevance of Swinburne's work springs from its intellectual affinities with a quantum mechanical model of reality, on one hand, and postmodern <i>autopoietical</i> ideas on the other.


<b></b>


<p>
<i>Autopoietic</i> processes develop through elaborate feedback loopings, of which self-awareness is the most complex and important. Poetry's second great feature, dialectically related to the first, lies in its ability to reflect on itself, as it were. For Swinburne, no other human activity commands this power so fully as poetic work. Poetry's special privilege lies in what his friend and fellow artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, called poetry's "motive power": its obligation to approach its subjects from an "inner standing-point." In that view, enlightenment and understanding do not stand upon the ceremonies of ultimate meanings and ideas (the weak point in science and philosophy); they turn upon themselves, being part of an emergent poetic process. Swinburne's critique of Christianity, like Sade's late enlightenment, is historically determinate.

<p>
This process of self-reflection has been traditionally marked by what we call the poet's intentions and the reader's interpretations. In Swinburne's view, because intention and interpretation are themselves momentary and transformational events, imaginative writing exposes itself to its own impersonal character. In Swinburne we observe a drama of poetic subjectivity diffusing into the language as such&#x02014;a startling effect in his work (it is less so in Dante's) precisely because Swinburne consciously situates his writing in the historical afterlife of Romanticism. The conclusion to "Anactoria"&#x02014;one of Swinburne's, and the nineteenth century's, greatest poems&#x02014;explicitly argues and demonstrates this view of poetry.

<p>
This signature poem illustrates much that is characteristic of Swinburne's work. Like Rossetti, Swinburne brought his writing to maturity by radically modifying the dramatic monologue&#x02014;a verse procedure that dominates his <i>Poems and Ballads</i> volume. The form possesses two salient properties: an immersive textual environment defined as the inner standing-point of the poetic speaker; a non-subjective frame of reference. These features clear the poetic space for the reader, who is shifted slightly but significantly away from the kind of sympathetic encounter set up by the conventions of a Romantic poem. 

<p>
Swinburne wanted to devise a more engulfing poetic space where the three possible forms of poetic consciousness&#x02014;authorial, readerly, and fictive&#x02014;would gain their identities, paradoxically, by a process of regular loss and transformation. In "Anactoria," Sappho as dramatic speaker is the primary exponent of such a process through her desire for complete union with Anactoria. But in the poem's climax (lines 189-304) her ecstatic declaration reveals her personal desire to be an index or symbol of a world-encompassing union in which she too is absorbed. Sappho is swept up into her own vision of "memories," "metaphors," and a host of "travailing . . . New Things and old things" so that she can finally declare: "I Sappho shall be one with all these things" (line 276). The future tense is crucial, collapsing as it does the space between the historical Sappho and this nineteenth-century resurrection poem, where her prophecy gets fulfilled and literalized. 

<p>
Were this a traditional dramatic monologue, that literalizing process would abstract the poet from the poetic space and remove the reader to a position of judgment, a <i>spectator ab extra</i>&#x02014;as we see in that exemplary example of the form, Browning's "My Last Duchess." An economy of socio-psychological realism organizes this poetic space. 


<b></b>


Swinburne prevents that from happening by breaking the spell of the realist convention and establishing the work in an order of what Marjorie Perloff has called <i>Radical Artifice</i>. The poem's tropic extravagance and "Pure Sound" are the most recognizable signs of this radical artifice. So too are the repetitive set of rhymes that control the poem. But two outstanding moments are particularly spell-breaking, at the realist order, and spell-binding at the order of artifice. 

<p>
The most famous is lines 155-88, which were in fact not part of the poem as Swinburne originally wrote it. Often criticized as a gratuitous attack on Christianity, apt for Swinburne but out of character for Sappho, the passage is in fact a key poetic device for connecting Sappho to her nineteenth-century resurrection and inheritance. The passage is there to draw the (contemporary) reader into the poem's action, whether in sympathy or in horror does not matter. Like Sappho, the reader must become, this way or that, "one with all these things." 

<p>
The other passage, even more remarkable, has yet (remarkably) never been commented upon. In a dazzling spectacle of prosodic wit, Swinburne fashions lines 47-58 as a kind of mirror image and repetition of the immediately preceding lines 35-46. (He repeated this kind of tour de force on a more grand scale in <i>Tristram of Lyonesse</i>, a poem that, he said, was written on the same principles worked out in "Anactoria".) Reading the poem, are we to think that the passage illustrates Sappho at the magical height of her powers? As Swinburne showing off? Either "interpretation" might be offered, but both point toward a third that encompasses and transcends them. As in a sestina or other intricate poetic form, the lines suggest that language itself, as it were, possesses within itself an infinite capacity for mutation and transformation.

<p>
Accompanying this diffusion of poetic subjectivity into the energy field of the poem is a dissolution that threatens and challenges the reader as well. Readers mark their drunken passages through the verse as "Pure Sound"&#x02014;a remorselessly self-involved prosodic spectacle. This response, while true in a sense, is impercipient. The work might better be viewed in terms of Arnold's comment on Shakespeare, so much admired by Swinburne: "Others abide our question, thou art free."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Readers will look (in vain) for "meaning" if they believe that meanings should stay for readerly determinations. Swinburne's poetry regularly imitates life because, as in life, its meanings spread and mutate and transform under our own pursuit. Negotiating a poem by Swinburne requires a state of attention that can scarcely be maintained and that is, in any case, never sufficient. Even the simplest poems, like "The Garden of Proserpine," run away with us:

<blockquote class="poetry">

Here, where the world is quiet;

<br />
&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	Here, where all trouble seems

<br />
Dead winds' and spent waves' riot

&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	In doubtful dreams of dreams;

<br />
I watch the green field growing

<br />

<p class="noIndent">
The poem's rhythm, stately but inexorable, locates places and things that immediately prove "doubtful": "Here"? Where is that? Is it the Garden of Proserpine&#x02014;and if we take it so, what is that garden, and where is it: in Sicilian fields of Enna, in the kingdom of Hades, in Italy, in Greece? Perhaps it is here in this poem&#x02014;or in poetry as such?&#x02014;that we are to locate ourselves. And who is speaking, who is this "I"? Proserpine? "The poet" ("Swinburne"?)? Besides, if the referential dimensions of the verse slip through our minds, what of the syntax? "Riot" is marked primarily as a noun but the play of syntax and line-termination suggest it might have been&#x02014;might still be&#x02014;a verb. And what do we&#x02014;what can we&#x02014;make of those possibilities? The enjambment at "seems" is another syntactic multiplier. Or consider the cunning ambiguities in lines 5-7: are those green fields (what fields?) being worked by these "folk" or are the fields active agents, growing in order to sow and reap the folk who are working them? And what of such "folk," what do they know of these "doubtful dreams of dreams"? Are we (readers) to take those meta-dreams as poetry? This poem? And if we do, what good is it to know of such meta-dreams, to enter them? What good is it not to know or enter? 

<p>
This text is relatively simple. Compared with (say) "Anactoria" it seems a mere piano exercise. Still, it exemplifies the all but intolerable demand made upon the reader by a typical Swinburne poem. To read him is to be reminded that a full awareness of even the simplest human experience is unachievable. One thinks of Blake, in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite" (plate 14).

<p>
Poetry is a machine for cleansing doors of perception. Swinburne is special not because he makes us acutely aware of, say, those "infinite mountains of light" perceived by the visionary Blake (<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>, plate 25), but because he makes a drama of our experience&#x02014;our knowledge&#x02014;of the apparition and evanishment of such phenomena. This drama involves curtailing the power of poetry's visual illusions&#x02014;that special door of perception, the eye, that had itself become a stumbling block by dominating, even (as in Blake) defining, perceptual experience. An inner standing-point is difficult to access through language when the perception's doors are patrolled by the eyes. In language, accessing the world through the eye&#x02014;what Pound called <i>phanopoiea</i>&#x02014;is to hold it at some kind of reflective distance. Swinburne's poetry of course deploys visual imagination everywhere. But if visualization is the sensory foundation for intellectual reflection in verse, as it is, the other senses are far more immersive and unmediated. When Swinburne forces the reader to negotiate language through its tactility and sound, he is moving to enlarge our perceptual resources. To speak of his verse as "Pure Sound" is to register Swinburne's critique of the dominance that visual imagination had gained in poetic theory and practice.

<p>
That critique, along with the reforming practices entailed by it, is perhaps Swinburne's greatest legacy to poetic tradition. Wallace Stevens's <i>Harmonium</i> is in large measure a lesson learned from Swinburne. The eye in that splendid book has become a moving point in a turning world, as "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" shows. It moves because it has been distracted to greater awareness by a pervading sensorium of other senses and sounds. And so Stevens can say, explicitly, that the "Theory" of his book is this: "I am what is around me." That is pure Swinburne:

<p class="noIndent">
Swinburne's late so-called nature poetry&#x02014;works like "A Nympholept," "Neap-Tide," and "The Lake of Gaube"&#x02014;exhibit this immersive imagination in unmistakable terms. These poems recall what later scholars have named "The Greater Romantic Lyric," but they recall to recast, for when Swinburne's eye/I enters the natural world it gets engulfed. In that experience one does not so much "see into the life of things" as one is seen through that pervading life, the way Beatrice is finally seen through the pervading light of Dante's Paradise. 

<p>
The dissolution is scarcely to be observed, however, lest one imagine that it could be understood by being <i>seen</i>. It is understood, rather, by being undergone. To read these poems is necessarily to be swept away by tactile and auditional immediacies, which here assume the status of what Eliot famously called an objective correlative. The correlated object of the poem is elemental, "great creating Nature" as it is known not by a God-like observer but by a percipient creature plunged within. The Nature known is a quantum, not a Newtonian, Nature.

<p>
As demonstrative of Swinburne's work as those late poems are, his lighter verse, so-called, may be more enlightening. The pre-eminent Swinburne scholar Cecil Y. Lang regarded Swinburne as "the greatest parodist that English poetry has ever seen."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  There is more to this judgment than might immediately catch the eye since a great deal of Swinburne's work is clear parody. <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>, for example, is a serious parody as are most of the poems in <i>Poems and Ballads .</i> The parody "Dolores" is striking exactly because it balances so delicately (and forcefully) between earnest and jest.

<p>
But the parodies Lang had in mind were masterpieces like "The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell," "Sonnet for a Picture," and "Nephilidia" (which Swinburne published in his famous <i>Heptalogia</i>) as well as several others not included there, like "Poeta Loquitur" and "Disgust: A Dramatic Monologue." All this is very high order nonsense verse, which Swinburne often also practiced in private: in his unpublished flagellation farces, for instance, and in impish <i>jeux d'esprit</i> like his "Fragment of an address from S. Joseph to S. Mary":

Brilliant wit pervades even this little epigram, which is quite worthy of what Byron mock-seriously called "all those nauseous epigrams of Martial" (<i>Don Juan</i> I. St. 43). The couplet's domestic vulgate works the words "bloody," "kid" and "pigeon" into a critical travesty of the Christian economy and one of its central ideas: Jesus as sacrificial scapegoat.


<b></b>


<p>
Like "Dolores," "Poeta Loquitur" is parody raised to another order entirely. Great parody, Lang observed, does not simply involve a critique of its source. It becomes in a sense <i>one</i> with that source, fused with it "like that of anti-matter to matter".<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This type of fusion culminates in Swinburne's self-parodies "Nephilidia" and "Poeta Loquitur," where an authoritative idea about poetry&#x02014;that it should achieve a perfect unity of sound and sense, of form and content&#x02014;becomes comically realized. The consequence is an apparition of writing as pure performance, writing that seems&#x02014;we remember Auden&#x02014;to make nothing happen but itself. Playing that game with his language, Swinburne achieves what few poets would dare to (or know how to) undertake: a critical satire of poetry itself from an inner standing-point, that is, taking itself as exemplum. The theory of poetry motivated at an inner standing-point here discovers a kind of perfect form&#x02014;at once completely expressive and completely self-aware. These works do not "dwell in possibility," as Dickinson splendidly imagined for herself; they dwell in an actuality Stevens celebrated and longed for. They demonstrate/argue/perform <i>autopoietic</i> action, they make <i>Nothing happen</i>: as Stevens once observed, "The nothing that is not there and the nothing that is."

<p>
Comic writing is alone equal to such an aspiration, as we know from Ovid and Rabelais, from Chaucer, from Byron&#x02014;in our own day, from Ashbery, Merrill, Bernstein. Searching poems for their meanings, we often forget that in poetry, language is not a vehicle of reference but a ral gesture. To make that gesture is to give momentary form to a reality that persists "beyond the singing of the sea." The cunning prepositional wordplay in that famous line from Stevens could scarcely be more Swinburnean.
