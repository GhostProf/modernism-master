<p>
Noland here provides a meditation upon the tangle of images encountered
and generated by the Lascaux caves in Bataille's work. She displaces it
out of the realm of Euro-American aesthetics and early twentieth-century
anthropology and into contemporary Paleolithic archaeology and the
cognitive aspects of image-making. Noland's intervention represents yet
another shifted superimposition over these celebrated "palimpsests" of
images. Putting aside the vexed issue of meaning, she not only suggests
what these images might have been doing in prehistory and in the early
twentieth century, but right now as well. Noland offers an insight
into the "agency" of these images, both prehistoric, modern and late
modern, while additionally commenting on Bataille's own intervention and
constitution of these images as an operation&#x02014;an enactment I would
suggest&#x02014;of the "informe" or "formless." Though Noland is at pains
to distance the notion of the "informe" and its associated transgressive
qualities, it nonetheless functions here operationally in terms of the
movements it engenders, the transgressive being one of many. "[F]ormless
is not only an adjective having a given meaning, but a term that serves
to bring things down in the world, generally requiring that each thing
have its form. . . . In fact, for academic men to be happy, the universe
would have to take shape."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
What Noland has shown is that Bataille quite consciously renounced
the requirement that "each thing have its form"&#x02014;working against
Breuil's, Windels's and Luquet's attempts to form and order the images
in terms of chronological palimpsests and the chronologies of Western
art history in general, as well as any other attempt to penetrate the
interiority of these images and read their meanings and disentangle them
"for academic men


<b></b>


to be happy." Thus Bataille anticipates a "methodological philistinism"
familiar in the anthropology of art proposed by Alfred Gell. Noland
traces how res such as Breuil moved the paintings from their contexts
among ethnographers and historians of religion and into the aesthetics
of modernism&#x02014;plotting the pulsations generated by these images
while asserting the significance of their movements as part of their
overall effect. This operation is facilitated by placing the embodied
observer, Bataille himself, within the caves, such that "Ce qui est
sensible &#x000E0; Lascaux, ce qui nous touche, est ce qui bouge." Thus an
argument is made for the agency of these images echoing recent attempts
in Alfred Gell's <i>Art and Agency</i> and the works of Bruno Latour.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Bataille's meditation here is shown by Noland as a brilliant displacement
or "embrouillement," further extended by Noland herself&#x02014;an
additional articulation of the movement of these images that has
transfixed and baffled prehistorians. Furthermore, the publication
of Lascaux by Bataille for a general public, albeit bourgeois,
extends the political scope of Bataille's operation of the "informe,"
"bringing things down in the world" out of the rarefied sphere of
academic discourse. The publication of these images for the first
time as color photographs displaces their effects, attenuating them
horizontally and democratically within the public realm and further
amplifying the surfeit of visual information engendered by these
confusing images. This is a displacement true to those "performed"
by the images themselves&#x02014;obscuring each previous apperception in
every instance they are beheld, whether through the lived and embodied
encounter with the site, the encounter within the academy, or in its
attenuated form with the general public&#x02014;and further in every
increasing encounter. This is done not by obscuring a meaning that was
never there to obscure, but by the productive power of the aggregative
effects that the displacement of these images facilitates. Thus as
the images "move" as on the sloping surfaces of the cave itself,
they also move, shift pace and syncopation through the infinite acts
of reading by the general public: erupting forth with every turning of
the page in every unpredictable setting. Such an operation suggests the
possibility of the fusion of perceptive horizons through the operation
of the "informe," "bringing things down" and engaging directly with the
effects produced through those individuals apperceiving these images;
that is engaging the data constituted by prehistorians as Bataille
did by recourse to one's own corporeal, perceptive abilities. This
operation is at once "true" in a phenomenological sense of what these
images do, while simultaneously it is the undoing of this "truth" as a
result of Bataille's operation&#x02014;it is this torque that provides
the explanatory power of Bataille's meditation. Bataille directly
references "the beauty that fascinates the visitor" by recourse not
to a Euro-American aesthetic sensibility, but to their somatic effects
produced through their movement ("in the urge to move, to displace the
body rhythmically, to model and expend kinetic energy choreographically")
in turn articulating the agency of these images as a Gellian "technology
of enchantment" that generates neither a "fixed" nor "open-ended"
meaning, nor any meaning at all, but a somatic apperception of movement.
<p>
As such Noland's intervention reanimates the pulse or syncopation of this
movement, shifting it from previous religious and modernist moments to
the operation initiated


<b></b>


by Bataille and further articulated by recent Paleolithic scholarship on
cognition, and, I would suggest, recent understandings in the anthropology
of art and of the agentic effects of visual and material culture. Thus
Noland's intervention through Bataille represents a successive marking
over previous ones, but whose analytical import is the totality of
these movements suggested by the overlapping and confusing marks
themselves. This syncopation and pulsation resumes. The "dance" that
these res might suggest is reanimated: the operation visually and
corporeally being as irresistible as that syncopation of music that moves
us&#x02014;regardless of form or content&#x02014;to dance. Thus a "truth"
is constituted not about what these images mean or signify but about
what these images do, but whose "truth" in turn, however, is displaced
yet reaffirmed with every subsequent movement.

<!--_title-->
Garbage: The Stuff That Dreams Are Made of
<br />
<small>
Response to Michael Shanks, David Platt, and William L. Rathje</small>
<!--_/title-->

<!--_text-->
<p>
Garbage appears in science fiction cinema with notable frequency,
whether in the retrofitted future Los Angeles of <i>Blade Runner</i>
 or the post-Holocaust bricolage of the Mad Max films or <i>The
Bed Sitting Room</i> . Whole cities can appear in ruins in the
"future archaic" subgenre; think <i>Logan's Run</i> <i>, Beneath
the Planet of the Apes</i> , or the more recent <i>A. I.</i>
. These futures give us a tingle. In the future, the past, our
present, will exist only as stubborn traces, debris that doesn't quite
disappear. It was not always thus: in <i>Things to Come</i> ,
scripted by H. G. Wells, the future-archaic Everytown is simply bulldozed
in an unparalleled paean to the technological sublimity of its gleaming
white city. A city, we note, without a trash can in sight (perhaps they
use disintegrator beams, like Robby the Robot in <i>Forbidden Planet</i>
[1956], or Daffy Duck in <i>Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century</i>
[1953]). This white city points back to the mock permanence of the White
City at the heart of the 1893 World Colombian Exposition in Chicago,
monumental halls whose stolid presence denied the fragility of the stuff
in which they were clad.
<p>
The all-new white city of <i>Things to Come</i> was founded on the
erasure of the past and harbingered a new beginning, and this theme was
echoed in the World's Fair held in New York City in 1939. The Futurama
ride carried visitors through the panorama of a future city, circa 1960,
where "unsightly slums" have been


<b></b>


displaced&#x02014;to where, no one says. Who takes out the garbage? Where
does it go? Beginning in the science fiction films of the 1960s, garbage
begins to persist, bubbling up in the interstices or encountered by
exiles roaming far beyond the physical boundaries of those perfect white
cities. <i>Planet of the Apes</i>  is perhaps the urtext here:
the debris that washes ashore from the shipwreck of human civilization
is nothing less than its rehead: a broken, blank Statue of
Liberty. Garbage generates nothing less than trauma, repressed memories
are given physical forms, but physical forms that are ravaged by their
long, hidden histories.
<p>
But I would like to consider science fiction garbage of another kind,
through a consideration of Joe Dante's brilliant and nearly forgotten
<i>Explorers</i> . In this film, a beautiful and wistful adolescent
boy dreams of the universe and life on other worlds. His two friends
are a frightfully indulged boy genius and a sweet kid from the wrong
side of the tracks. The latter's father is a junk man by trade, and
of course the kids have no trouble finding wonders amidst the cast-off
possessions of the adult world (sharp-eyed film geeks will spot Rosebud
hanging in a corner). The first boy has been dreaming of the universe,
but has also been given instructions on building a mobile bubble of a
force field that they can enter and pilot. Aliens, the kids realize,
have been calling to them, summoning them through outer space. "It'll
be the greatest thing ever," the dreamer rhapsodizes. He dreams the
diagrams, the whiz kid cracks the equations and the junkyard provides
the spaceship, actually an old carnival ride retrofitted to accommodate
new kinetic marvels. The face of an old television provides a front
window, washing machines provide the ports, a suitcase is worked in
somewhere. There's a metal trash can attached to the front that serves
no particular purpose other than to remind us of this craft's provenance
as nothing more than the debris of an adult world that has no more room
for boyish fantasy. (Although it should be noted that the one adult who
discerns their plan wants nothing more than to join them: "Good luck,
kids," he calls as their craft takes flight into the eerie dark of space.)
<p>
So far, the film has evoked the whimsy of childhood, a warm tale of
youthful imagination unsullied by the messiness of adult (or even later
adolescent) life. We might even note that the nostalgia the film evokes
here is not toward an innocent boyhood, but of a particular kind of
story of wide-eyed wonder amidst the chirping crickets and reassuring
solidity of small town life. This terrain is familiar, not from our own
memories, but because Spielberg, Bradbury and Stephen King have taken
us here before. Garbage is the stuff that adults forgot was cool; it's
the stuff that dreams are made of.
<p>
The boys soar above their town like the kids riding their flying
carpets in Steven Millhauser's appropriately titled novella <i>Enchanted
Night</i>.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Then they soar above the atmosphere, and encounter the alien craft that
awaits them. "We are going where no man has gone before," the dreamer
breathily intones, his fantasy at once innocent and, we retrospectively
realize, very mediated. The bashful aliens lurk in the corners until the
first boy approaches them: "I've waited my whole life to say this," he
says, "We come in peace." One alien peeps out, and replies, with perfect
Mel Blanc cadence, <i>"What's up, Doc?"</i> Paradigm shift. Return.
<p>
<i>What's up</i> is that the aliens have learned about earth by monitoring
our airwaves; rather than watching the skies, as the journalist at the
end of Howard Hawks's <i>The</i>


<b></b>


<i>Thing From Another World</i>  advises, they've been watching TV,
and learning from what they've watched. Their speech is a m&#x000E9;lange
of television and radio forms: they sing the theme from <i>Mr. Ed</i>
and the notion of a talking horse seems suddenly banal alongside these
rubberoid, bouncing, colorful creatures. But most of it is garbled:
bits of old commercials and the half-forgotten voices of long-dead
game shows. They lip-sync to Little Richard's "Rock and Roll is Here to
Stay," surrounded by floating screens on which we can discern cartoons,
old movies, commercials, test patterns, and, importantly, static, known
also as white noise.
<p>
White noise is a recurring trope in postmodern culture, as I hope to
have outlined in my <i>Terminal Identity:</i>
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
it's the background noise of image bombardment, of too much information,
of an intrusive data glut. So <i>Explorers</i> is about garbage, not
just the retrofitting of our abandoned past to make a vehicle that
can carry us to our future, as the kids have done in their backyard,
but our <i>electronic</i> garbage: the noise that's been spilling out
all over the place since broadcasting first began. Trash TV. And these
aliens are garbage collectors of a sort, but not really, because they
simply don't know that it's <i>garbage,</i> the ephemeral byproducts
of a burgeoning popular culture, waves in space casting their debris
upon alien shores. Surrounded by floating screens and drowning in a
babble of voices, the interior of the ship is like a Nam June Paik
piece twisted by way of Frank Tashlin. The aliens waver hilariously
between endearing and annoying, their communication nothing more than a
bricolage of sound bites that interweave songs, jokes, sound effects,
<i>shtick</i> of every variety. Of course the hidden irony is that
the dreamer's dreams were equally shaped by television; he's just
been watching different programs. He can't hide his disappointment:
"This isn't the way I imagined it at all." "Look," one replies, "I
know I look weird to you but how do you think you look to me? Listen,
I watched four episodes of <i>Lassie</i> before I red out why the
little hairy kid never spoke!" Things begin to look up when they're
captured by space pirates, but it's really just the aliens' father,
scolding them for borrowing the family spaceship. Our kids are sent home:
the adventure is over.
<p>
Brief coda: In <i>Demolition Man</i> , Sylvester Stallone plays a
twentieth-century cop awakened from a hundred-year cryosleep to a world
without violence. The film, surely the most charming large-scale action
adventure film that I know, presents Stallone coping with a series of
emasculating encounters. "Let's go blow this guy!" chirps his partner,
a less-than-perfect aficionado of now-contraband twentieth-century mass
culture. "<i>Away,</i>" replies the ineffectually stolid Stallone,
"Let's go blow this guy <i>away</i>." His most depressing moment is
when he learns of the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library ("Wasn't
he an actor back then?" someone asks). And as they drive along,
the twenty-first-century cops sing along with their favorite Quick
Tunes&#x02014;"<i>You</i> called them 'commercials.'" Our electronic
garbage, it seems, shapes a long future.

<p>
Lucas's compelling critique of archaeology's words for itself leads me
to ask two questions: 1. "Is what makes a word a word the fact that it's
being used as a word or the fact that it's shaped like a word?"
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
2. What's time to a pig?
<p>
The second question is the punch line to a joke: Guy walking down
a country road passes a farm. Farmer is standing underneath an apple
tree, holding up a large pig; said pig is eating apples from the tree's
branches. Guy asks the farmer what he's doing. Farmer replies, "My pig
likes apples. I'm giving him some help here." Guy says, "But doesn't
that take a lot of time?" Farmer says, "What's time to a pig?"
<p>
What the farmer means is "My pig has no sense of time. Your question
is therefore a silly one." The joke is a joke because it reorients the
subject of the question from the farmer to the pig&#x02014;we understand
time to be of concern to people, rather than farm animals; but the farmer,
an egalitarian sort, is there to remind us that while pigs are not people
too, they are part of history, and


<b></b>


indeed may be occupying it far more fruitfully, ahem, than
bipeds. Further, the fact that to a pig time means nothing is not only the
point but, insofar as it is (qua punch line) the trump card, a position
to be envied. The ostensible becomes a shell game (pig for farmer),
and the ontological gets to kick the epistemological (knowing about time
is mocked by time meaning nothing). At a further level, the ontological
becomes, as it were, brute fact: this is what the farmer means when he
chooses not to say "When's time to a pig?" The logical absurdity of giving
time shape, according it what-ness, is laid bare by virtue of colloquial
necessity. Humans can only speak to each other by making such mistakes.
<p>
The "'discovery' of prehistory" entailed, Lucas says, "the discovery of a
new method of understanding the past: the analysis of material culture"
. Lucas's central move thus links prehistory to ontology, which
he sees as the fallout of prioritizing "material culture before text"
. However, this form of privileging material culture ("in the
specific context of archaeology, material culture was to have the upper
hand" [111]) evinces the same limitations Lucas sees in the privileging
of history as narrative. Indeed, to apply Lucas's canny observation that
there is no difference between material culture as an object of scrutiny
and as a method (prehistory "blurs the distinction between method and
material" [111]), there is no difference between his understanding of an
object as a shape or a mark, and as a sign. Another way to put this is
to say that Lucas is torn between making plain "the radical project of
modernity" as an "attempt to put material culture on an independent basis
for understanding the past"  on the one hand and "highlight[ing] the
close relationship material culture has with textuality, or discursivity"
 on the other. Lucas does indeed see the relation as close; in fact
he confuses them. Proceeding on the assumption that material culture
involves a form of interpretation distinct from reading while at the
same time failing to distinguish between a mark and a word, he is bound
to both schism and conflation.
<p>
I take Lucas's use of the word "understanding" to mean
"interpreting"&#x02014;and interpreting in a manner distinct from reading,
because you cannot read what is not language. For prehistory to have
its purchase, it is essential that the objects material culture engages
be distinct from words, not only in the case of archaeology conceiving
prehistory as a time before text, but in the case of prehistory "put[ting]
material culture on an independent basis for understanding the past"
. The archaeologist is able, via material culture, to interpret
the object in a manner that does not involve reading it.
<p>
But this is not what the archaeologists are doing. In ceasing to see
a piece of rock as a thunderbolt and beginning to see it as a tool
the archaeologists are giving the objects authors: "These objects were
originally interpreted as 'solidified lightning' and viewed as natural
objects; we now recognize them as stone axes" . They are reading
the objects, ascribing to those objects intention and, coextensive with
that, meaning. It is the archaeologist's job to understand the difference
between a sign and a wonder, to distinguish between words and marks.
<p>
Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels have argued that the line between
"what a text means and what its author intends it to mean" is nonexistent;
the two instances


<b></b>


of meaning are "identical."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Their example was a set of marks washed up on a seashore which resembled
a Wordsworth stanza. The marks looked like poetry, but as Knapp and
Michaels argued, were one to believe that the marks were produced by
chance, rather than an author, the marks could mean nothing, because
they were not language. This argument rests on their contention that
"marks produced by chance are not words at all but only resemble them"
("AT," 732).
<p>
If you assign meaning to a set of marks, you are ascribing to them
intention, and with that comes the transformation of marks to language. If
you ascribe intention, you are reading a language. The limit case is
found in Lucas's advocacy of archaeology as "an engagement with the
unconstituted present" , which finds its perfect articulation in
garbology. Knowing how to read garbage means laying bare "the frequent
incongruity between what people said and thought about their consumption
habits and what they actually did" , dealing with "contexts in
which discursivity is either absent or <i>intentionally suppressed</i>"
(117; emphasis added). The archaeologist who studies garbage is able
to talk trash, to access meaning and intention at a purer&#x02014;because
less pasteurized&#x02014;level. Archaeologists are doomed to be readers.
<p>
Lucas states that were one to be employing material culture as both object
of scrutiny and as methodology "there can be no date or time after which
we might say that this is no longer archaeology" . Inevitably, the
issue becomes identity&#x02014;both in the sense of what archaeology is,
and how archaeology continues through time in a consistent enough fashion
to be understood as a continuous, however modified, entity. Lucas says
that he does not find these questions to be interesting ones: "[S]ome
skeptics might question whether such a project is archaeology. Well,
actually I do not care. And I am not sure many people care that much about
disciplinary purity, which is surely the only reason for engaging in such
debate" . I intend zero slight to Professor Lucas when I suggest
a parallel between his position and the joke's punch line: no slight is
intended because just as the farmer understands the pig to be concerned
not with theory but with apples, Lucas is saying that archaeologists are
more interested in how they spend their time than in what other people
think they are doing with it. This is quite healthy. However, Lucas takes
the notion of "disciplinary purity" as continuous with the practice of
naming, and this need not be. Happily, it is not the case that in order
to call a discipline by its name one must believe that the discipline
is homogenous, autonomous, endogamous, monogamous or in any sense pure.
<p>
This allows me to say that I have a sneaking feeling that an archaeology
concerned with 2004 is something in excess of itself&#x02014;forensic
sociology, anthropological eschatoscopy avant la lettre,
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
or perhaps what Bill Brown will one day call "object relations in an
expanded field."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Like Lucas, this does not trouble me; it fails to trouble me not
because I am attempting to demonstrate that that there is no such thing
as archaeology, but because arguing over the evolution of the word
archaeology is proof that it means something, despite (and because of)
the fact that people feel more or less comfortable with seeing themselves
as informed by, or others as partaking of, its identity. However, I
am ready to be chastised by archaeologists. And in order to facilitate
this, I will end by pushing Lucas's argument beyond the logical extreme:
why not


<b></b>


advocate that archaeology unearth the future? The question of what
archaeology is may most convincingly be answered by those who are doing
it, but it is only verifiable as such by those who one day will have
done something else.

Schnapp's tightly focused case study proves to be a formidable vantage
point from which to consider, and possibly reformulate, wider questions
about modern uses of the past and archaeology's role in mediating such
evocations. The paper centers on an event that did not happen, as Pavia
was <i>not</i> reconstructed in the 1930s according to the Ciocca/BBPR
radical modernist and corporativist urban plan that appealed to the city's
Roman past; instead it remained one of the spectacular historical medieval
towns of Italy. In his investigation of this non-event, Schnapp places
the modernist plan's turn to the past in a rich variety of contexts as
he recounts the drawing of the proposal in the wake of the 1933 CIAM at
Athens, the failure of the project at the open competition for Pavia's
urban planning, the ensuing controversy and the combative exhibition
dedicated to the failed plan itself. These different moments take
us on an interdisciplinary ride into the culture of modernity, from
the Fascist culture wars, to the novel means and arenas in which these
conflicts were fought&#x02014;such as the exhibition at the <i>Galleria il
Milione</i>&#x02014;and to individuals' trajectories realized against this
complex background. Schnapp stimulatingly disentangles these many threads
while keeping to his leading question&#x02014;the tension between the
radical modernist project of urban rebuilding and its appeal to the past
as framed by a quotation from Livy. He resolves this tension by exposing
the urbanists' mistaken interpretation of Livy's text&#x02014;<i>omnes in
corpus unum fusi sunt</i>&#x02014;which was wishfully understood to resonate
with modern fascist corporativism. Schnapp shows how the evocation of that
past, Roman austerity and its civic and rational <i>virtus</i>,was put
in the service of functional architecture and the new radical modernist
program. This


<b></b>


skillful analysis is not only a case study in the use of the Roman past
and archaeology in Fascist culture but also illuminates broader questions
about the central role of archaeology in modernity.
<p>
The appropriation of ancient Rome in modern Italian Fascism has received
considerable attention in the until recently little explored field of
the history of archaeology. Well before the recent efforts to understand
various aspects of Fascist culture&#x02014;from industrial development,
economic organization and transportation to architecture, the organization
of consensus and their relation to avant-gardist movements&#x02014;as
distorted but somewhat genuine forms of authoritarian and compulsive
modernization, the idea of Rome was long considered the only cultural
component of Fascist ideology even by Italian scholars who, like Norberto
Bobbio, disdainfully opposed the application of the category of culture
to any of the activities of the Fascist regime.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Since the 1970s, moreover, the very role and work of classicists and
archaeologists during Fascism has come under scrutiny, thus touching
a sensitive spot for the Italian academy, which arguably displays
unsettling continuities through the pre- and post-Fascist periods
(for example, eight popular as well as scholarly periodicals dedicated
to the ancient world of Rome were started under Fascist sponsorship,
and many of them continued publication well after 1945, and some unto
the present day). Luciano Canfora called as early as 1976 for both the
exposure of such connections and the investigation of how such contacts
influenced the content of scholarship. Debates have been harsh (most
recently about the publication of some apparently "Fascist" letters by
the famous ancient historian Arnaldo Momigliano); Italian colonialist
archaeology overseas, as well as the excavations of the Fori in Rome,
much desired by Mussolini himself, have come under close investigation
and strong criticism.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
But Canfora's dismissal of Fascist ideas of Rome as devoid of any
historical depth needs to be further examined: we have learned much about
the misdeeds of academic archaeology under Fascism, but less about the
practices and cultural contexts in which to place them, thus possibly
creating an artificial gap. For example, a recent article effectively
shows how in the 1930s a Roman historian strongly aligned with the
regime produced both propaganda for Fascist corporativism and highly
valued scholarly work on ancient Roman <i>collegia</i>.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
This simple denunciation of dichotomy rather calls for further
investigation from the perspective of interdisciplinary studies. In
moving across the borders of scholarly culture, Schnapp's study leads the
way, offering further insights into conflicting uses and constructions
of the past in Fascist Italy.
<p>
The Pavia plan case study shows that both the past and the modes of its
appropriation were fields of contest. As early as 1922 Mussolini made
ancient <i>romanitas</i> central to his ideological project: he talked of
an "Italian [ancient] Rome wise and strong, disciplined and imperialist"
and of the need to strip and liberate Roman monuments from all that had
grown around them during the centuries of decadence. But stripping is
no neutral practice: it can reach different depths and reveal different
layers. The Ciocca and BBPR's proposed stripping of Pavia reveals a
different ideal Fascist Rome more in line with the ambiguous attitude
of Le Corbusier in "Lesson of Rome," who ironically concluded his appeal
to Rome's example by stating that a visit to the eternal


<b></b>


city would cripple students of architecture for life. Le Corbusier's
concern was not just that later periods' monuments obscured Roman glory,
but that Rome had always been too "huddled together."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
According to him, Romans were at their best as great architects, and
indeed the first planners in Western history, not in Rome itself,
but in the newly conquered, empty regions they equipped in order
to control. This was the same <i>romanitas</i> that Ciocca and
BBPR laboriously searched for and claimed in Pavia's origins as
a Roman <i>castra</i>. Le Corbusier, seeing through buildings and
monuments of "huddled together" Rome, detected and distilled their
underlying simple masses and geometries (cupolas, vaulting, cylinders,
rectangular prisms, or pyramids). Pavia, on the other hand, with its
rich display of essentially medieval architecture of the Lombard,
communal, and Viscontean past, offered no such possibility. Ciocca
and BBPR conjured their vision of the Roman past by taking recourse
to Livy's narrative and pointing to the feeble traces in Pavia's maps
of the Roman <i>castra</i>'s original regular structure. This complex
palimpsest of texts and map surveys stripped Pavia back to its Roman
origins, while simultaneously projecting its future and putting the
modern urbanists poised for reconstruction face to face with the ancient
Roman city planners praised by Le Corbusier. But Pavia's Roman past of
Scipio, Cato, and Caesar's moral and military virtue, is much different
from the Augustan imperial one sought for in the excavation of Rome's
imperial Fori.
<p>
Despite the different version of the Roman past pursued by the Ciocca and
BBPR in Pavia and the Augustan revolution in Rome, these projects also
share practices and modes of representation which further speak to the
significant role of archaeology in the construction of modernity. The
exhibition of the Pavia plan in Milan at <i>Galleria il Milione</i>
cannot but recall the grand exhibitions on ancient Rome of those years:
the 1911 exhibition on Roman culture's contribution to the West, but
especially the one to honor the bimillenary of Augustus, the <i>Mostra
Augustea</i> planned in 1933 and opened in 1938 (on the same day as
the exhibition on Fascist revolution) which combined a chronological
arc (reaching from the founding of Rome all the way to Fascist Italy)
with an exploration of daily life in ancient imperial Rome. On a smaller
scale and with no objects, the Pavia exhibition shared with the Augustan
one the effort to move the visitor, by means of very modernly conceived
images, through time and space to a vision of a city, be it future
or past. The excavators in Rome boasted: "we have dug out 4,000 cubic
meters of soil, we have transported to the dumps 10,000 cubic meters of
remains, we have reconstructed at amazing heights 1,300 square meters
of roofing." These words would have sounded just right in the mouth of
Ciocca, but while special laws allowed the destruction necessary for
the excavation of the Fori, Pavia was preserved. In some ways Ciocca
and BBPR are the ideal archaeologists as they conjured their vision
without the actual destruction that archaeological practices necessitate,
but also suppress in their claims to recover the past. But as Schnapp
shows, it is precisely the close relationship between construction and
destruction embodied in archaeology that puts it at the center of many
tropes of modernity. Encounters between ideology and scholarship take
place within this wider context, in which, just as in scholarly debates,
the past is contested ground. We are reminded that any such appropriation


<b></b>


of the past involves a selection, as Schnapp writes, by another project
realized in post-World War II Italy by the surviving members of BBPR. This
is the Torre Velasca, an unusual modernist skyscraper in Milan that uses,
instead of ancient Rome, the model of the medieval tower (explicitly
alluding to the towers of the Castello Sforzesco)&#x02014;and combines a
geometric and modernist shape with a Gothic look.

[<i>Originally published in</i> Denkm&#x000E4;ler, Forschungen und Berichte
als Fortsetzung der Arch&#x000E4;ologischen Zeitung, <i>ed. Eduard Gerhard
(Berlin: G. Reimer, 1850), 203-5 (see pp. 176-7).</i>]
<p>
1. By <i>archaeology</i> we mean the branch of classical philology based
on the monumental works and traces of ancient engineering, rather than
on literary sources and objects. This includes works of architecture
and the plastic arts, as well as the study of sites and inscriptions.
<p>
2. The main topics of archaeological study are the study of monuments,
art history, and artistic artifacts; art instruction, art criticism,
and the explication of art are also available to it as tools, just
as Grammatics, together with literary criticism and hermeneutics,
supplements philology in the narrower sense.
<p>
3. The task of archaeology is to present not just a selection of art
monuments, but the entirety of the monumental material, both for its own
sake and in its consequences for literary, religious, and individual
relics; the entirety of all philological research and the total world
view of ancient life.
<p>
4. Research on monuments of classical antiquity must take as its starting
point the literary knowledge on which so-called philology in the narrower
sense is based; the archaeologist treats antiquity's monumental aspect
on a philological basis. To this end antiquarians of all sorts supply
him with material, while artists judge and examine it for him.
<p>
5. This dependence of the archaeologist on antiquarians and artists,
which has often incorrectly led to the extension of the


<b></b>


term to include antiquarian dilettantes of all kinds, makes the
archaeologist's procurement and assessment of material all the
more difficult, as material of varying artistic value is constantly
accumulating from very different places.
<p>
6. We gratefully acknowledge educated travelers, as well as resident
researchers at classical sites, among the antiquarians who bring the
cache of classical monuments to the knowledge of the archaeologist.
<p>
7. The archaeologist must learn about the rules and models of art from
architects and plastic artists in order to cultivate his own feeling for
drawing and artistic style by viewing and comparing numerous artworks
of different genres.
<p>
8. The archaeologist must treat this material consistently with the form
and limits of philology, so that his work will resemble and reciprocally
supplement the philologist's: his explication of art standing beside
the criticism and explanation of philological texts; his art history
standing beside the literary history of antiquity; his other research,
especially on religious and individual relics, standing beside the real
representation of ancient life.
<p>
9. German archaeology only arrived at this understanding of its task
in the last decades. Earlier it was impeded by the one-sidedness of
the aesthetic point of view, on the one hand, and on the other hand,
by the lack of substantial observation of ancient monuments of all
different types.
<p>
10. In order for archaeology to advance in this philological sense,
its method must not so much adjust to the needs of the antiquarians or
the artists&#x02014;although it is also recommendable for it to encroach
on these&#x02014;but must rather be grounded in strict relation to overall
philological instruction.
<p>
11. Even in primary education, the art world of the ancients should
only be introduced in connection with reading the ancients; moreover,
a feeling for ancient art can be developed as part of the acquirement
of technical skills.
<p>
12. Archaeological studies will first thrive in the universities when,
during the usual course of study, it is taught in closer relationship to
philological education, both in its subjects as well as in its practical
exercises, than was possible according to study programs up to now. Young
men who turn towards archaeology without thorough philological training or
particular artistic capability should be deterred rather than encouraged.
<p>
13. When philologists, distrusting their aesthetic feeling, avoid
the art world of the ancients, they forget that ancient monuments are
indispensable to them not simply for their own sake but also as sources
of antiquarian knowledge. When others encounter the difficulties of
archaeological resources, they do not realize that these resources are
now affordable in proportion with their benefits.
<p>
14. Collections of statuary plaster casts are the most distinguished means
of inspiring and cultivating a sense for the beauty and majesty of Greek
art up to a sound level. On the other hand, a sense for composition is
formed more by comparing other art genres&#x02014;here no masterpiece of
composition of any genre can be done without.


<b></b>


<p>
15. Resources necessary for the study of archaeology in universities
include, on the one hand, a teaching apparatus (<i>Lehrapparat</i>) to
augment the lectures with diverse perspectives and, on the other hand,
an exercise apparatus, in order to supplement the teaching in a timely
manner with the resources necessary for the explication of art. This
should include architectonic models, masterpieces of every technique,
and palpable and clear presentation sheets to accompany the plaster
casts. Besides such presentation sheets, the teaching aid should above
all consist of a choice of the most important books for archaeological
study&#x02014;a supply similar to the public libraries (which are not
always sufficient), such as philological seminars have.
<p>
16. Archaeology or monumental philology was promoted for a long time
in Germany almost exclusively by numismatics and Greek epigraphy;
its importance is becoming more recognized, although it has not yet
come into the right connection with philology overall. Therefore,
no appropriate means towards this end should be neglected; a regular
consideration of archaeological studies from the side of philology is
also to be wished for.

<p>
The broken pot, the pot in fragments, the scattered shards, is the image
that Gregory Jusdanis's text leaves us with, along with the dilemma of
whether to reconstruct the pot or display the fragments. The implication
being that archaeology desires the reconstructed whole, whereas poets,
some travelers and others perhaps, would find more awe and inspiration and
mystique in the fragments and ruins, as many have done in the past. His
final passage nicely and poetically sums up Jusdanis's edifice, whereby
archaeology stands for science and knowledge, as opposed to the romantic
inspirational desire of the traveler. Yet I want to complicate the picture
we are left with, revisit some the ground he has covered, and perhaps,
as an archaeologist, pick up some of the fragments from the ground,
and attend much more carefully to their form, detail, historical and
mnemonic weight.
<p>
Interestingly, the notion of the fragment is one of the recent
preoccupations of archaeological thinking. While much of earlier
archaeology was preoccupied with the restoration of the whole, the
re-creation of missing parts, and the reconstruction of completeness,
some of us, partly inspired by Oceanic ethnographies, have started
thinking about the broken shards, rines,


<b></b>


bones, objects, and artifacts, in the recent or the remote past; some
of these objects point to intentional fragmentation, and to their often
wide circulation among people and communities, as tokens and talismans
of human relationships, as devices that linked ("enchained") people over
long spatial and temporal distances;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
at other times, these fragments may have acted as mnemonic objects
that would have helped re-collect the fragments of memories, memories
of events, ceremonies, and rituals; memories of people and places.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
Moreover, the notion of archaeology as a science which strives to
save the past and pursue the objective recovery of the truth, an image
that emerges from Jusdanis's text, is one that has been heavily eroded,
especially in the last two decades, and one that many of its practitioners
will not recognize. For them, archaeology produces various pasts, out of
the fragments and traces that have survived; this is a complex process of
production, intricately implicated with processes of identity, politics,
institutional power, disciplinary authority, and history. Archaeologists
do not just save and reconstruct: they select and valorize, but also
ignore and destroy; they produce material realities, but they also tell
stories; they too, like poets, are cultural producers working in the
field of representation.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
This reexamination of archaeology's ontology has also led to the
excavation of the discipline's genealogical and epistemic foundations. As
Jusdanis implies, archaeology has been a key device of capitalist
modernity, but one which possesses distinctive features that deserve
closer examination. Even before the establishment of archaeology as
an autonomous discipline, however, people were not indifferent to the
material traces of the past; contrary to Jusdanis's claim that they showed
"no interest in excavating the earth for its cultural treasures, other
than the pursuit of the riches in graves," recent discussions have shown
that in many different contexts starting from antiquity, ruins of the
past aroused intense interest in people, who invested them with their own
memories, meanings, and associations, often incorporated them in their
own material and social lives, and produced their own narratives and
stories about them. In other words they produced their own archaeologies.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Of course, archaeology as an autonomous discipline, a European
nineteenth-century invention, established its own discourse, narrative
techniques, institutional practices, and authority, often incorporating
some of the premodern meanings, but shaped decisively by the national
imagination; archaeology produced its object of study (the archaeological
"record") in the same way that national imagination produced its
object of desire, the nation-state. Travelers in the classical lands
of the Mediterranean, who, for at least two centuries previously
were searching for their own roots and identities, for paradise lost,
cast their colonial gaze upon what they saw as ruins frozen in time,
as remnants of the classical golden ages that were left undisturbed
by humans (or so they thought), save for the occasional shepherd and
his flock, to be discovered and enjoyed (and often plundered too),
at leisure and in perfect isolation. National archaeology, which in
contexts like Greece was formed at the interface between local and
European discourses, practices, and institutions, came to spoil all
that. It claimed the ruins primarily for the nation, purified them from
the "remnants of barbarity," cleared them from the undergrowth, often


<b></b>


rebuilt the temples from the scattered stones, erected a fence around
them, and displayed the finds in museums, often in a fetishized and
sanitized manner.
<p>
Archaeology thus expressed, helped bring about, and more importantly,
materialized, a competing identity discourse: the panopticism of the
national imagination,
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
as opposed to the colonial gaze of the romantic Western travelers. In
that sense, the reaction of the latter, who lamented the loss of the
perfect isolated ruin, is perfectly explainable. Archaeology was only
one of a whole constellation of developments, one of the many collateral
devices of modernity;
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
it can be seen as an exhibitionary device, along with museums, the grand
World Fairs, and photography; display, spectacle and surveillance lie
at their foundations. National (and neoclassical) aesthetics demanded
purity and completeness,
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
hence the ritual cleansing of the remnants of barbarity from the Athenian
Acropolis (from the Ottoman mosque inside the Parthenon&#x02014;the specter
of otherness for the European imagination&#x02014;to the medieval tower in
the Propylaia), in the same way that language (the modern Greek language,
for instance) was purified from recent, polluting, "foreign" intrusions.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
As the nation-state of Greece strove to produce its modernity, as
the material signs of that modern life became more and more evident,
both in the now reconstructed and managed ruins and elsewhere, the
new wave of travelers, the tourists, closed their eyes to them: as the
nineteenth-century Western photography of Greece shows
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
the neocolonial gaze preferred to see only the classical monuments
(which as reconstructed ruins proved particularly photogenic, eternal,
and timeless), not the signs of other historical periods and of modern
daily life, especially the signs of Western modernity.
<p>
Archaeology shares with literature and poetry more than the desire to
represent, to produce discourses and narratives, reflective or not,
about sameness and otherness. The construction of the past out of
fragmented traces, be they stones and broken pots or fragments of
memories, is perhaps a key shared device here. The text with all its
connotations, as materialized discourse, and as a product of "weaving,"
of producing something new out of scattered things, is another one. In
nineteenth-century Greece, the re-collection of the past out of its
material fragments was a constant preoccupation of authors, historians,
and archaeologists alike;
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
it was, after all, the re-collection of the national dream.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In twentieth-century modernist poetry, this desire still prominent
(as Jusdanis shows) acquired new meanings; after all, the national
aesthetic discourse was reinventing itself, incorporating more recent
ruins, such as the Byzantine ones, and reinstating the notion of
unbroken continuity, producing thus an indigenous Hellenism: the raw
materials of late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century Greek modernity
included not only the ionic capital, but also the Byzantine crosses,
and the edifice was decorated with modern na&#x000EF;f paintings such
as the ones by Theophilos. Yet these constructions have become more
and more diverse. Seferis, the high priest of Greek modernist poetry,
the poet-as-nation (to recall one of the studies on him),
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
is tormented by the anxiety that his compatriots cannot communicate
directly with the ancient stones and statues; they fail to discover
the true essence of Hellenism. Cavafy on the other hand projects a
nonessentialist, hybrid Hellenism, wide enough to include a multitude
of Eastern Mediterranean identities;
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
and Calas, the Trotskyist, revolts against the bourgeois appropriation
of classical antiquity.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<b></b>


<p>
Finally, I would like to return to the cryptic quotation by Jameson that
introduces this text. This passage, the final sentence in his recent
study on modernity, does not refer to the discipline of archaeology; it
simply follows the trend of theorists, from Freud to Benjamin and Foucault
(not to mention countless recent writings) who have found archaeological
metaphors of immense power. Yet his passage resonates with some of the
previous discussion in more ways than one. My preferred reading of it
here is not that far away from the author's intentions, as I understand
them. He suggests that radical alternatives and transformations cannot be
imagined within the conceptual field of the "modern" and of modernity, a
term that he would prefer to see replaced with "capitalism"; he proposes
instead the "displacement of the thematics of modernity by the desire
called Utopia."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
To return to the broken pot with which I started, there are more
options available to us than passively to display the shards or the
reconstructed whole; neither the colonial and the neocolonial gaze
nor the sanitized sight of national aesthetics (be it archaeological,
poetic, photographic, or whatever) is a satisfactory solution. The
fragments of the pot with their materiality, sensory and mnemonic
weight, and historical resonances, can offer multiple, imaginative,
inspirational experiences, the utopian archaeologies of the future.

<p>
I am sure that Julian Thomas's forthcoming book, <i>Archaeology
and Modernity,</i> is a fine and interesting study, but the
"abbreviated" version of its argument which he offers in the present
essay is, to this reader at least, a bewildering story of diverse
phenomena&#x02014;Renaissance humanism, British empiricism, Cartesian
foundationalism, Newtonianism, "social physics," Cuvier's comparative
anatomy, the rise of the nation-state, the advent of the museum,
the introduction of World War One military technologies, and much
else besides&#x02014;the concatenation of which somehow accounts for
the distinctively "modern" character of archaeology. Modern means
bad. It means atomization, reification and disworlding serial
classification. Perhaps that explains why the concatenation in
question works, in this "countermodern" telling, more according to
pre-Enlightenment principles of sympathy, correspondence, and analogy
than to the principles of causality, typology, and rationalization
that Saint Foucault associated with the epistemic ruptures of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Given the original sin through
which archaeology came into being as a discipline&#x02014;the sin of modern
objectivism&#x02014;it is guilty of reifying bygone human beings and using
them "as raw material for creating narrative processes." This is not good,
for by "reduc[ing] them [the people] to the atoms of a social system,
or to rational foraging organisms, we subject them to a totalizing
logic." Thomas has a logic of his own&#x02014;whether totalizing or not
is not for me say&#x02014;that leads him to infer that "this kind of
totalizing is close in spirit to totalitarianism." What else could it
be, given that it's modern? Conclusion: "If we find ourselves willing
to organize the lives of


<b></b>


people according to grand conceptual schemes" (as if Thomas's essay were
not an exercise in grand conceptualization) "we are that much more likely
to find it acceptable to do the same to people in the present." Beware,
then, of archaeologists!
<p>
I suppose part of the privilege (or license) of being "countermodern"
is that one can have it all ways: modernity atomizes, and thereby
totalizes. Modernity analyses, hence synthesizes. Modernity disworlds,
decontextualizes, renders the continuous discrete, yet at the same time
it integrates the diverse in grand conceptual schemes. The countermodern
tribunal does not acquit, it only condemns, for the terms of its
indictments change freely, though not randomly.
<p>
The most interesting part of Thomas's essay, from this reader's point of
view, is the section on "Depth and Surface." While most of the essay seeks
to show how archaeology devolved from a host of theoretical, practical,
social, and ideological forces we associate with modernity, here Thomas
gives archaeology some active agency in the story: "Archaeology was
integral to the development of this 'depth thinking,'" he writes,
alluding to the "depth models" (Jameson) that are the hallmarks
of modern thinking (the relationship between speech and grammar in
linguistics, infrastructure and superstructure in Marxism, authenticity
and inauthenticity in existentialism, the conscious and the unconscious
in psychoanalysis, etc.). That the excavations of archaeology may have
provided (at the very least) the metaphorical basis for these depth
models is a suggestion one hopes Thomas develops more substantially in
<i>Archaeology and Modernity</i>. Another thought-provoking suggestion in
this section has to do with how "the uncovering and recovery of hidden
deposits and artifacts is sometimes held in higher esteem than the
interpretation and appreciation of ancient things that are already fully
visible." The reasons for this devaluation of the visible in favor of
the hidden and buried belong to the dark underworld of modernity's will
to truth. That will to truth takes the form&#x02014;much exacerbated of
late&#x02014;of delving into the transphenomenal depths of the phenomenon
in order to bring to light what is shrouded in darkness, to wrest from
concealment that which, for reasons of its own, does not belong by nature
to the world of appearances. Much of contemporary science digs through the
humus of the natural world, of the body, of the biotic itself, in order to
uncover the underlying components of their elemental constitution. There
is more here than just a vague analogy between archaeology, science,
and a will to truth that forces both nature and history to yield the
secrets that lie buried in their depths. It is this unearthing of the
earth that more than anything else calls for thought today.

<p>
Ruins have always incited a reflective, lyrical, or melancholic
response. People are perversely fascinated by the sight of crumbling
temples, of abandoned cities overgrown with shrubs, of marble heads
peering out through the sand, of roads grown silent. They take a macabre
pleasure in observing the evidence of human decay and the final victory
of nature over civilization. Individuals through the ages have taken
different lessons from this drama.
<p>
Some see in ruins a cautionary tale of the futility of greatness and
the inevitability of rot. Like the anamorphic portrayal of the skull in
Holbein's magnificent painting, <i>The Ambassadors,</i> ruins serve for
them as a reminder that everything human will one day perish. For others,
however, ruins represent the longevity of human creation. The Parthenon,
the famed city of Persepolis destroyed by Alexander, and the mosaics of
Leptis Magna in North Africa stand as testaments of art and engineering,
humanity's defiance against the sands of the desert and of the hourglass.
<p>
While we, like people in the past, may be stirred by the majesty of
the Pyramids or moved by the ashes of Carthage, we nevertheless have
a different perception of the material past. Our view is colored
by archaeology, which, in its desire to save and restore the past,
transforms it into something modern. Archaeology paradoxically makes
ruins look "unancient": skeletal remains brought to life in sound and
light shows. Scrubbed, fenced off, and scaffolded, ruins have never
looked as they do now.
<p>
Previous societies, as travelers Rose Macaulay and Christopher Woodward
have pointed out, allowed buildings to tumble, disappear, and become
covered by flowers. Quite often people constructed their houses or entire
cities on the wreck of previous


<b></b>


settlements, as Christian Rome was built upon the pagan city. Early
Christian churches often incorporated broken columns, fragments
of sculptures, or marble slabs from classical temples into their
structures. These early buildings were essentially syncretic (in the
way early Christianity was), combining the pagan and the Christian
architecturally as well as theologically. Ruins formed part of the urban
and natural environment, a habitat not only for bushes, birds, and bats,
but also for hermits, visitors, and madmen. Christopher Woodward waxes
elegiac about how until the nineteenth century the Colosseum was an
enchanting garden of rare plants and flowers&#x02014;brought as seeds,
it is believed, by the exotic animals once slaughtered there&#x02014;and
a refuge for poets, artists, beggars, pilgrims, and eccentrics.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
The Acropolis was cramped with postclassical structures, including a
Frankish tower and an Ottoman minaret. Today, with these buildings
gone, the Acropolis is supposed to represent the classical period,
even though in that age it never looked like this.
<p>
Both Macaulay and Woodward mourn the cleansing and ordering of the
past. "It is the familiar tragedy of archaeology&#x02014;the sacrifice of
beauty to knowledge," Macaulay complains.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This sacrifice of stillness and mystery represents for Woodward a loss
to the poet. For the archaeologist, "the scattered fragments of stone
are parts of a jigsaw, or clues to a puzzle for which there is only
one answer, as in a science laboratory" (<i>IR,</i> 30). The poet,
by contrast, looks for any answer stirred by the imagination. Macaulay
and Woodward bring to the fore that peculiarly modern dilemma: Should
we leave the material past as it is, deriving inspiration from it? Or
should we clean it up and protect it, thereby rendering it static? There
is little doubt on which side they stand.
<p>
Woodward, for instance, longs for the Colosseum of yesteryear, the garden
visited by Chateaubriand, Goethe, Byron, Poe, and fictionally by James's
Daisy Miller. Instead of today's "bald, dead and bare circle of stones,"
he yearns for the 1820s when Stendhal watched an Englishman ride his
horse in the arena at night. "I wish that could be me," he adds wistfully
(<i>IR,</i> 30-1). Macaulay and Woodward dream of the rapture among ruins
experienced by travelers before archaeology, like the indefatigable Lady
Hester Stanhope arriving in 1846, as one of the first Europeans, to the
once glorious Roman city of Palmyra, hidden deep in the deserts of the
Levant; or the French architect who chanced upon the extraordinary Doric
Temple of Apollo at Bassae (Arcadia), forgotten for centuries except by
local shepherds.
<p>
Those who take the hair-raising drive to this temple today, passing
by villages clinging hopefully to cliffs, come upon a Christo-like
work&#x02014;a bizarre-looking structure covered by a white, gleaming
canvas rising in a series of cone towers. Archaeologists have taken
this extreme step to protect the temple from the harsh mountain
environment while they restore it by disassembling the entire structure
piece by piece. The effect of the cover, which may last for decades,
is virtually to erase the temple from the mountain. In place of the
Doric masterpiece is a postmodern work. "Et in arcadia <i>non</i> ego,"
Macaulay and Woodward would say. One can only imagine how travelers
from the ancient geographer Pausanias onwards reacted upon arriving at
the solitary spot and witnessing the austere splendor of the ruins so
vulnerable, exposed to wind and ice. What hubris must have possessed
the cosmopolitan architects of the Parthenon to


<b></b>


construct a temple on a mountain in Arcadia! "A noble wreck in ruinous
perfection!" wrote Byron of the Colosseum
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
&#x02014;mournful lines describing the Temple of Apollo at Bassae as well.
<p>
The protective wrap that robs the temple of its nobility points to the
uniqueness of our modern, archaeological conception of ruins. In the
service of the state and the doctrines of nationalism and historic
preservation, archaeology has tidied sites by razing non-ancient
buildings, clearing the temples of vegetation, cataloguing all the fallen
pillars, fencing them off from the city, guarding them from further
decay. Archaeology has attempted for a hundred years to spruce up aging
beauties by removing blemishes and wrinkles.
<p>
Has the whitewashing of the edifices led to the departure of the Muses,
as Macaulay and Woodward fear? Can modernized ruins still mesmerize? Do
we have a spiritual relationship to ancient sites fenced off from their
urban and natural setting, trampled by tourists, and littered with Kodak
boxes? Can a building on which neither spider webs may form nor owls
roost still stir our imagination?
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
A look at the way modernist Greek poets understood and used the past in
their work could help us answer some of these questions. For these poets,
like their nineteenth-century predecessors, made frequent references to
antiquity. The ruins of Athens had become an inevitable topic for these
poets for two reasons. First, the international discourse of Hellenism,
which had posited classical Greece as the fountainhead of European
civilization, had rendered classical culture a compelling topic for
all the arts. Modern Greeks poets followed suit. Unlike the Europeans,
however, who sought their <i>continental</i> roots in Hellas, modern
Greeks traced their <i>national</i> genealogy to the ancient Greeks. They
came increasingly to view themselves as heirs to an illustrious tradition.
<p>
Second, Greek poets could see classical monuments every day. Yiannis
Psycharis (1854-1929) had the major political, artistic, and philosophical
luminaries of Athens come to life on the Acropolis, for instance in
<i>To Taxidi mou</i> (1888 [My journey]).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Not solely a topic to be learned abstractly in the <i>Gymnasium</i>,
the classics could be seen in the refurbished Parthenon, heard in the
purified Greek language, and experienced in pre-Christian customs. Thus,
unlike H&#x000F6;lderlin, Freud, Ernest Renan, or Virginia Woolf, Greek
poets never had to ask themselves whether the Hellas taught in school
actually existed. Few experienced moments of epiphany on the Acropolis
or rapture in the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion. These poets had joined
artists, architects, city-planners, historians, linguists, folklorists,
and philologists in the grand enterprise of the nineteenth century to
restore classical Greece.
<p>
In order to understand the relationship between archaeology and
modernist poetry, we need to look briefly at the way archaeology
(along with folklore and literary criticism) had been conscripted in
the nineteenth-century mission to resurrect Hellas. As Greeks began in
the latter part of the eighteenth century to trace the source of their
ethnic uniqueness in antiquity, they employed archaeology to provide
the material basis for their claims.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
In one respect this was a predictable method of justifying
authority. Royal families and ethnic groups have often sought the
prestige of a glorious


<b></b>


past to bolster their power. In modernity, as the Greek case shows,
this pursuit has been spearheaded by a nationalism that sought for the
first time in history a union between culture and power, the nation and
the state, the government and the governed.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
In their quest for liberation from the Ottoman Empire and the
establishment of an independent nation-state, Greek nationalists used
classical antiquity as a way of demonstrating to Europeans the efficacy,
integrity, and durability of Greek culture. They also identified
the value of a glorious past in their strategy to endow Greeks with
the self-assurance to undertake the exciting but perilous journey
towards modernity. As the earliest people of the Ottoman Empire to seek
political sovereignty, they were the first to see the significance of
both the existing monuments and future archaeological discoveries as
banners of national identity. The Greeks were the first to understand
the larger political significance of archaeology, seeing in it a means
of legitimating geographical and historical claims, of demonstrating
a diachronic continuity, and of instilling in people a sense of pride
about their past. Other nations in the Balkans and the Near East have
subsequently employed this argument in their pursuit of independence.
<p>
Although the growing Greek interest in the past was partly a result of
the European discourse of Hellenism, it was also a nationalist reaction
to the plunder, motivated by this discourse, of antiquities, which began
in the seventeenth century. A German archaeologist had quipped with some
justification that by 1840 the most renowned examples of Greek art were
to be found in European museums.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
It was understandable, therefore, that the Greeks should attempt to
gain control of both the idea and the physical remnants of Greece. To
this effect the Philomousos Etaireia was formed in 1803 in Athens for
the study and protection of antiquities. Adamandios Korais (1748-1833),
the first Greek scholar systematically to study Greek antiquity, called
in 1807 for the end of the removal of antiquities and manuscripts from
Greece. Once established, the provisional government passed a law in
1829 forbidding the export of ancient artifacts.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
The Archaeological Act of 1834 set out to regulate the practice of
excavation. In the course of the nineteenth century the Greek government
passed successive measures to administer the excavation of sites,
fund museums in Athens and the provinces, and generally preserve the
remnants of the past. To protect the monuments of Athens, Eleni Bastea
has shown, planners fenced them off, removing them in this way from
the city fabric. More important, they endowed monuments with sanctity,
making their destruction not only illegal but also sacrilegious.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
These very acts had the effect that so strikes the modern traveler of
distancing the monuments from everyday life.
<p>
The Greek conception of the past was quite pragmatic. Greeks had little
nostalgia &#x000E0; la "Ozymandius" for the lost world of broken statues;
no feelings of sorrow at the passing of greatness; no sense of awe at
the ephemeral nature of earthly power. Rather than anguishing over the
destruction of the temples, Greeks had to preserve them and to prevent the
further plunder of what they now considered their inheritance. Archaeology
exuded this national optimism, promising more beautiful objects and
knowledge about the past.


<b></b>


<p>
The care for antiquities transcended archaeology itself, having become a
major concern of politicians, intellectuals, artists, journalists, poets,
and teachers alike. It was part of the greater effort to restore the past,
promoted by leading institutions, which touched all aspects of life. This
effort was motivated by the belief that Greeks could resuscitate the past
by planning cities according to ancient models, by purging the demotic
language of Turkish words, by giving classical names to children, by
praising the Acropolis in verse, and by designing neoclassical buildings.
<p>
This conception of antiquity shows the ongoing political and cultural
significance of the past. The Greek case shows that, rather than an
escape from daily realities, history can live in the present by pushing
it to the future. The Greeks turned to the past in their attempt to
become modern. A neoclassical Athenian house in the nineteenth century
was a sign of cosmopolitanism; a photograph of the Acropolis could serve
worldwide as a metonymic representation of modern Greece; for modernist
poets the classical material served as a way of addressing contemporary
problems. The Greek use of the past demonstrates what Woodward says more
generally of ruins: "When we contemplate ruins, we contemplate our future"
(<i>IR,</i> 2). The entry into the museum, Jonah Siegel argues in his
discussion of the "nineteenth-century culture of art," indicates a direct
engagement with what it means for a society to preserve, to organize,
and to admire objects from the past.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By the end of the century and the advent of literary modernism, this
project had lost some of its confidence. The constant comparisons of
modern to ancient Greece and the inevitable disappointments became
taxing. The classical tradition, rather than providing a source of
pride and inspiration, had grown heavy. Neoclassicism developed
into a procrustean machine, pushing for linguistic and aesthetic
conformity. Under these pressures, Greek poets, like their counterparts
elsewhere, began to find the classical tradition stifling.
<p>
No European poet confronted the meaning of this de-idealization of
Greece more than Constantine Cavafy (1862-1933), who lived and died in
Alexandria, a city in the Hellenic diaspora. Cavafy was perhaps the
most archaeological poet, passionate in excavating the past but also
interested in uncovering an adulterated Greece, a Greece of cultural and
racial mixing. For Cavafy the past was alive, relevant, and modern. With
the exception of a few poems, his tone was rarely elegiac; he hardly
mourned the eclipse of ancient Alexandria. Unlike nineteenth-century
poets, and even his contemporary, Angelos Sikelianos (1884-1951), who
evoked the golden period of Greece, Cavafy preferred the Hellenistic age
and Roman late antiquity, epochs associated with decline and exhaustion.
<p>
Moreover, Cavafy developed a penchant for forgotten or neglected res
from these periods, for people to whom official narrative devoted only
a few lines. In "Kaisarion" , for instance, the speaker peruses a
book of inscriptions devoted to the Ptolemies. Bored by the sycophantic
praise of renowned kings and queens, his attention is drawn by a reference
to the minor king, Kaisarion (Caesarion), son of Cleopatra and Julius
Caesar, put to death by Augustus who feared "too many Caesars" claiming
the throne. At the end, the speaker imagines what he was like, beautiful,


<b></b>


sensual, and ideal in his sadness, because so little was written about
him. Not sharing the archaeologist's respect for historical integrity,
the speaker fills in the missing pieces of the mosaic.
<p>
In this and other poems, Cavafy dug through the deposits of time to
uncover the scraps of history. He approached antiquity as an epigrapher,
searching for inscriptions beneath romanticized layers of textual
scholarship. Characteristic is "In the Month of Athyr"  in which
the speaker attempts to decode the meaning of a gravestone. Through its
form and content the poem dramatizes the praxis of archaeology&#x02014;the
concern with the material world and the challenges of making broken
inscriptions, pots, and sculpture speak about their original surroundings.

<p>
The very first line places us in the act of reading a damaged
inscription. The vertical division of the poem emphasizes the effort
of extracting meaning from the disred surface by compelling the
reader to confront a caesura in every line. Square brackets, empty
spaces, rows of dots, and references to defaced lines further reinforce
the archaeological nature of our approach to the ancient world. As
the speaker's eyes descend along the lines of the stone, he uncovers
some facts: The inscription stems from well after the time of Christ;
the stone marked the grave of a Christian young man called Lefkios who
lived in Alexandria and died in the autumn at the age of twenty-seven;
he was loved deeply by friends and relatives.
<p>
In addition to enacting the scene of archaeology the poem reveals
Cavafy's modernist understanding of the classical past: He sets the poem
in late antiquity rather than the fifth century; he chooses Alexandria,
part of the extension of Hellenism at that time, rather than Athens
or mainland Greece; he focuses on the imaginary Lefkios, one of the
city's ordinary inhabitants, rather than on celebrated historical
res. "In the Month of Athyr" is one of about seven funerary poems
whose subjects are undistinguished young men&#x02014;young Willy Lomans of
the time&#x02014;taken from the racial, ethnic, and religious mix of the
Eastern Mediterranean. By focusing on this world, Cavafy prered by
many decades our contemporary interest in multicultural and hybrid Greece.
<p>
Having written about the Trojan War and the Battle of Thermopylae in early
didactic poems, Cavafy turned his back on heroic epochs, preferring the
"ignominy" of what


<b></b>


was then widely believed to be a period of Hellenic cultural
exhaustion. Since he studied and wrote about this period, he knew very
well that the fifth century could never be restored. Cavafy had no time
for an everlasting Greek spirit. The Parthenon makes no appearance in
his oeuvre. This stands in contrast to the paeans written to this temple
by poets in the latter nineteenth century;
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
or to the passage in Psycharis's <i>To Taxidi mou</i> in which the
major political, artistic, and philosophical luminaries of Athens
come to life on the Acropolis of his day. Cavafy too made the ancient
Greeks come alive in his poetry, but his were the average Lefkios and
Lanis of the street. Although he took an oblique angle to Hellenism,
he continued to represent it as a supreme value, the global cultural
system of post-Alexander antiquity that elites of the Mediterranean
and Near East identified with. He qualified its authority by showing
it beholden to Roman power and vulnerable to barbarian threats. His
Hellenism, therefore, was ironic and self-mocking, conscious of its
own historical limitations while being open to racial and ethnic mixing.
<p>
Cavafy's modernist farewell to Hellas constitutes part of a larger
historicist reappraisal that had begun to situate Greece in the context
of the ancient world. No longer the originary culture par excellence,
Greece came to be regarded as an important society among the other
civilizations of antiquity&#x02014;Egypt, Persia, Israel, Sumeria, and
Babylonia&#x02014;some of which were ancient themselves by the fifth
century. Scholars of Egyptology and Assyriology, for instance, looked
to the classics as a paradigm for the development of their own fields,
adding, thereby, three thousand years to the history of Greece.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
In this sense, classical studies paradoxically contributed to the undoing
of the Hellenic model. And archaeology itself played its part in the
ultimate ruin of this ideal. Although classical archaeology arose as a
discipline from the search for beautiful sculpture (the most prestigious
form of classical art in our post-Winckelmann world), it necessarily
unearthed information about the material world of Greece and other
Mediterranean societies that buried the ideas of Greece as source of
civilization and of classical art as ideal form.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The excavations on the Acropolis, for instance, revealed statues of
<i>korai</i> (maidens) and <i>kouroi</i> (youth) from the sixth century
<small>B.C.,</small> painted in bright blues, reds, and yellows, colors
which seemed garish and tasteless to those who were accustomed to the
bright gleam of Pentelic marble. Similarly, the vast digs at Pompeii
and Herculaneum exposed a highly eroticized world of huge phalluses,
fornicating couples, men engaged in anal copulation. These scenes,
depicted on vases as well as on house walls, displayed a bacchic
sexuality in contrast to the idealized male torsos of neoclassicism,
which invited a restrained, if homoerotic, appreciation. Moreover,
the more knowledge archaeology yielded about Greece and about the
societies contemporaneous to and preceding it, the less credible was
the neoclassical ideal of an immaculately conceived Athens whose only
goal was the appreciation of beauty.
<p>
Modernist poets, like Cavafy, embraced this de-idealized picture
of Hellas. Modernism itself reacted against the calcification of
classicism. In general, it became disenchanted with the restoration
project in which archaeology was a chief participant. Instead of taking
the past as a given to be exploited, modernist writers problematized


<b></b>


their relationship to it. They increasingly asked themselves whether we
could know the past at all as archaeology had promised, whether it could
be resuscitated in a way still meaningful to the present, or whether
the past had become a dead weight.
<p>
We see these questions posed in the poem, "The King of Asini," by the
Nobel Prize-winning poet Georgios Seferis (1900-1971). Like Cavafy,
Seferis was born in the Hellenic diaspora, in his case, in Smyrna
(Izmir). In contrast to Cavafy's bare, reserved, metonymic language,
he wrote in the grand modernist manner of T. S. Eliot, developing an
elliptical and highly metaphoric verse overloaded with images of loss,
war, alienation, and homelessness.
<p>
Unlike Cavafy, Seferis did not develop a theory of antiquity; yet he
returned to ancient Greece as a way of commenting on the horrors of the
modern world. In the sublime "Helen," for instance, he used a different
version of the Helen myth
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
&#x02014;in which a likeness of Helen went to Troy while the real one
stayed in Egypt&#x02014;to reflect on the vanity of war and on the ease
with which human beings are deceived into ting for nothing:

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And the rivers swelled blood in the silt
<br />
for a linen wave, a cloud
<br />
a butterfly's flutter, a swan's feather
<br />
an empty shirt, for a Helen.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, in "The Argonauts," he employed Jason's courageous but
compliant companions as symbols of toil, exile, and silence. Having done
their duty in order to retrieve the Golden Fleece, these sailors died
one by one without any recognition. "No one remembers them. Justice."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Other poems are littered with broken statues that allude less to
antiquities than to a disjointed life today.
<p>
"The King of Asini" differs in that it actually deals with the ancient
world, and specifically with the capacity of archaeology to reveal the
secrets of the past. The poem begins with a brief citation of the word
"Asini," which Seferis takes from the <i>Iliad,</i> in the same way that
he starts his "Helen" with a quotation from Euripides's tragedy. That
the Greek language constitutes, along with Chinese, the longest unbroken
linguistic tradition in the world, allows Greek poems to quote texts
from previous ages without necessarily having to translate them into
the demotic. Modernist poets, as Vassilis Lambropoulos explains, used
the device of quotation, rather than that of allusion, to address an
earlier text.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Cavafy was the master practitioner of this technique, constantly
incorporating material from classical sources in his poetry, showing
thereby the diachronic extensions of Greek as well as the thickness
of textuality.
<p>
The citation of ancient or Byzantine lines in modern poems demonstrates
the continued presence of the classics in modernity. In Seferis's case,
the quotation emphasizes that antiquity is both familiar and strange to
the Greek reader, who can recognize words but would need some help with
the ancient Greek syntax. This juxtaposition of the known with the unknown
works well in "The King of Asini," since its theme is the gulf between
antiquity and the present. The speakers, the unnamed "we," have been


<b></b>


searching two years for the grave of the King of Asini, one of the Greek
warriors who fought in Troy. They acknowledge the scanty written record,
for "only one word exists in the Iliad and that uncertain." Like Kaisarion
in Cavafy's poem, all have forgotten the king, even Homer himself. The
only reference we have is the word "Asini" in the "catalogue of ships"
section of the <i>Iliad</i> that Seferis cites. In Cavafy's poem the
speaker/poet spurns the well-documented kings and queens, deliberately
choosing to write about Kaisarion so as to fashion him freely in his
mind as a beautiful, sympathetic boy. He delights in the paucity of the
written record because this enables his creative freedom. For Seferis,
on the other hand, this lack becomes a metaphysical problem, frustrating
the speakers/poets who long to know the past. The word "Asini" lies
buried like a "funerary gold mask," incapable of speaking about itself.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
When they touch it, they hear an empty sound like that made by the still
unexcavated jar. The King of Asini is himself a "void below the mask,"
his children statues, and his "desires the fluttering of birds." What
remains of the king are metaphors: the wind "in the intervals of his
thoughts" and the memory of his "ships docked in a vanished harbor."
<p>
Tarrying among the stones "the poet" asks himself what we can possibly
unearth from the soil of antiquity. What can we find here "among
these broken lines, edges, points, cavities, curves?" Nothing, is his
answer. Capable of knowing little of a "previous living existence," we
are left with only the "weight" of its memory. Running our fingers along
these very stones, we can perhaps sense the king's "touch" lingering on
them. Or we can believe that he has taken the form of a bat, darting out
of the cave and striking the light "like an arrow hitting a shield." These
ghosts now haunt the once mighty citadel of Asini.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The image of the bat hitting the sunlight shows that these unfenced
ruins still inspire the poet. But it is important to distinguish
between the search for the citadel of Asini by the speakers of this
poem and Macaulay's and Woodward's visits to the Colosseum. Seferis's
anguished questions about the very existence of antiquity differ
from those posed by Western travelers in pursuit of a communion with
ancient ruins. Rather than expressing surprise at finally witnessing a
world-famous monument or disappointment at the sight of fences, Seferis
wonders what we can ascertain of the life beneath the funerary mask. He
asks whether the Greek stones speak to his modernist sensibilities. His
negative response indicates not only disenchantment with the sanguine
promises of archaeology to communicate with the past; it also manifests
weariness with classical antiquity as both cultural ideal and subject
matter for art. This is why the poet himself becomes a "void." His own
emptiness tacitly acknowledges that antiquity has become a "weight"
for moderns and modernists alike because they can find little to say
about it. The modernist poet is silenced by the stillness of the past
and by the modern verbiage about this stillness. The poet in Seferis's
poem expresses both the anxiety of influence&#x02014;that his approach to
antiquity was borrowed from Cavafy
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
&#x02014;and the anxiety of excess&#x02014;that thousands of lines have
already been devoted to the classics. Hence modernists chose to change
the topic or to write in a different mode, as we will see in the case
of Nicolas Calas.


<b></b>


<p>
It is ironic that, although archaeology had first raised questions about
the ahistorical conception of Greek art by unearthing information about
Greek and other societies, classical archaeology in the twentieth century
has buried its own past. It has chosen instead for decades to identify its
fate with the very classical ideal that it helped historicize. Because
of this disciplinary amnesia the revolutionary aspect of archaeology
has also been forgotten. Yet archaeology as an approach to history
is unprecedented. While other societies had an interest in the past,
nothing resembling the modern discipline of archaeology existed before
the modern age.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
There was no systematic study of previous societies and certainly no
interest in excavating the earth for its cultural treasures, other
than the pursuit of the riches in graves. The ancient Greeks, for
instance, had a very limited antiquarian tradition, at least before
Alexander. Hellenistic kings and then the Romans first began to value
and collect examples of Greek art, a practice to be revived in Byzantine
Constantinople
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
and later in the Italian Renaissance. The great families of Renaissance
Italy, such as the Farnese, Medici, and Ludovici, as well as popes and
bishops, began to acquire vast collections primarily of Roman copies of
Greek sculpture. Their desire for Greek originals led to excavations
that yielded such extraordinary discoveries as the 1506 find of the
Laoco&#x000F6;n, a dramatic Hellenistic sculpture depicting the writhing
bodies of the Trojan priest Laoco&#x000F6;n and his two sons being strangled
by huge serpents.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Works such as these came to represent the epitome of Greek sculpture:
simplicity and quiet grandeur, or in the words of Johann Joachim
Winckelmann (1717-1768), composure in the midst of passions.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
This strong interest in Greek art established a relationship to antiquity
that was unique, for it posited classical Greece as a utopia worthy of
emulation. Travelers went to Italy and then to Greece with the aim of
observing, recording, and removing its masterpieces. To highlight the
difference between these modern travelers and their ancient counterparts,
Nikolaus Himmelmann points to the trip to Greece undertaken by the Roman
officer Aemilius Paullus in 167 <small>B.C</small>. Although Paullus
observed famous works of art, he saw them principally as religious
representations. Similarly, when travelers came through these regions
during the Middle Ages, they did so as pilgrims or crusaders rather than
as collectors of art.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
It was modernity, Himmelmann argues, that first created antiquity
as a completely different society, a non-Christian alternative to
itself. There was no such temporal or cultural other for the Greeks and
Romans; no ancient languages to be learned, no substitute for Greek and
Roman literature, no supplementary world, save for the deep mythic past
and the barbarian hordes beyond the frontiers.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Although the Greeks and Romans interacted with the barbarians in war and
trade, they had set up the cultural boundaries between themselves and
the outer world so dramatically presented in Euripides's <i>Medea</i>
and Aeschylus's <i>The Persians</i>.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
For modernity, however, the classical period constituted something
familiar and strange, a society separate from the present yet also
connected to it, an ideal to be copied and a burden to be overthrown.
<p>
Winckelmann contributed hugely to the creation of this double inheritance,
having made the admiration of classical art, particularly sculpture,
mandatory for Europeans. In <i>Reflections on the Imitation of Greek
Works in Painting and Sculpture</i> , for


<b></b>


instance, he argued that the only way for moderns to become great was
by imitating the Greeks as opposed to imitating nature.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
His observation of Greek statues in Rome helped establish the modern
appreciation of art: Viewers are invited to find in an object an ideal
of beauty. His work determined the simultaneous historicization and
idealization of art, placing Greek art in its historical context and
on a pedestal. It is not by chance that Winckelmann never traveled to
Greece, preferring an aestheticized Greece to the real one. An actual
visit might have ruined his fantasy.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
At the same time, however, his work provided art with its own
disciplinary history and associated it with a wider history. In
<i>History of Ancient Art</i>  he explicitly connected Greek
art to freedom. It was the self-governance of Greece, he argued, that
created the superiority of its art.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
The free Greeks, in turn, he argued, loved beauty as no other people.
<p>
This idealization of Greece increased the demand for knowledge about the
country. More and more Europeans searched for an ideal in an area still
ruled by the Ottomans. Travelers extended the Grand Tour to the Greek
territories and the Levant in their effort to identify and describe
famous classical sites, often using ancient historians like Pausanias
as their guides.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
They brought back with them inscriptions, broken statues, parts of
temples.
<p>
Archaeology was a pastime for these aristocratic men concerned with
expanding both their cultural horizons and their personal collections. In
the course of the nineteenth century, however, archaeology evolved
into a scholarly practice, part of the university-based science of
<i>Altertumswissenschaft</i> that German scholars had created.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
This was the time of the first systematic and large-scale excavations
in Greece: Olympia , Delphi , and later the Agora in
Athens. Although motivated by the discovery of exceptional sculpture
to rival the Elgin Marbles (stored in the British Museum), the Victory
of Samothrace (the Louvre), and the pediments of the Temple of Aphaia
in Aegina (the Glyptotek, Munich), these excavations actually gave
archaeology scholarly credibility in the field of classical studies. For
archaeologists in the nineteenth century were the ones responsible for
discovering, interpreting, and popularizing Greek art, the one realm
in which the ancients held superiority over the moderns.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
That Greek archaeology gained scholarly credibility does not mean that
it had jettisoned its idealized approach to the past. Like modernism,
it remained caught in the contradictions of its epistemological
inheritance. Both literature and archaeology were products of the
eighteenth-century philosophical, cultural, economic, and social
transformations that saw the rise of the notion of aesthetic autonomy,
the practice of aesthetic appreciation, and the institutions of art,
literature, and criticism. As a result, modernism and archaeology
conceived of culture as a collection of masterpieces and upheld the idea
of transcendent beauty. More important, both believed in the purity of
aesthetic forms.
<p>
Thus Cavafy subjected to criticism nearly all social institutions
(religion, government, bureaucracy) and norms (sexual, moral), except
beauty. He foregrounded art by turning his poems into exercises for the
reflection on art, poetry, language, tradition, and the audience.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
He rendered poetry, and by extension art, a human fabrication without
mystery and aura. At the same time, he enjoined readers to appreciate
beauty,


<b></b>


in art or in youth, with a nearly religious devotion. Beauty was for him,
on the one hand, a human invention, and on the other, a Platonic domain
of permanence. In his poetics earthly beauty, such as that of Lefkios,
could be saved in the absolute realm of poetry. The only solace in a
world of aging bodies and ruined civilizations was that transcendent
realm of art. The goal of the artist was to save ephemeral experiences
by entrusting them to this realm.
<p>
This is also the role archaeology has assumed for itself. On the one hand,
archaeology contributed to the historicization of Greek art. But on the
other, it persisted until the last few decades in affirming the primacy
of this art. Because Greek archaeology, according to Ian Morris, saw
itself as part of Classics rather than the general field of archaeology,
it showed little interest in challenging narratives based on literary
texts with its ability to trace historical change.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Greek archaeologists embraced "the innocuous role of shielding the
textual world from disruption by material culture."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Until recently they have tied their fate to the preeminence
of Greek culture in the West. But as its superiority was
subjected to critique&#x02014;to which they wittingly or
unwittingly contributed&#x02014;they were left little ideological
justification. Nonetheless, Stephen L. Dyson asserts, Greek archaeology
functions even today as if the aesthetic values of Hellenism still held
the same relevance in scholarship or society at large as they did a
hundred years ago.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
Modernist poets have reacted to this continued idealization of art and to
archaeology's mission of aesthetic restoration and preservation. This
critique comes out quite clearly in the poem, "Acropolis," by the
avant-garde poet Nicolas Calas (1907-1988) who, like Cavafy and Seferis,
spent his adult life outside Greece, first in Paris and then in New
York. As a modernist poet, Calas could not write about the Acropolis,
a place of overdetermined national and global significance, without
the distance of irony. After all, what could he possibly say about
it that had not already been said by politicians, poets, journalists,
art historians, or archaeologists? By the time of modernism both the
Acropolis and archaeology itself had become familiar in Greece to the
point of becoming oppressive to many. In the work of the popular national
poet Kostis Palamas (1859-1943), for instance, the word "Acropolis"
occurs eighty-eight times and "Parthenon" ninety-one times.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
In his poem, "The King's Flute," Palamas associated the "pure and
grand Doric temple" with the nation: "Each time Fate pitilessly strikes
the Nation [<i>Genos</i>], the temple, the heart of the Nation first
withstands the blow."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
It would have been impossible for Calas to ignore the various
interpretations of the Acropolis. So in a typical avant-garde way, he
wrote about the uses, or interpretations, of the Acropolis. His first
object was Yiannis Psycharis, who promoted a militant demotic version of
the popular language, Greek culture, and antiquity that Calas felt debased
antiquity. He then criticized foreigners, like the Swiss photographer Fred
Boissonas (who conducted extensive photographic visits of Greece in the
early twentieth century) for exploiting the image of the Acropolis. While
in Psycharis Calas saw the vulgarization of the Parthenon, in Boissonas
he condemned its commodification. Renan, "the official sexton of the
Acropolis," initiated the modern pilgrimage by foreigners to the sacred
rock while "Herr Karl Baedeker" let in the hordes with the "Agfa and Kodak


<b></b>


rolls of film." For Calas these tourists daily bombard the Parthenon with
their cameras, shooting it much in the way that the Venetians in 1687
bombed the interior of the temple where the Turks had stored gunpowder.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<p>
As a modernist devoted to the purity of forms, Calas was disgusted with
the transformation of the Acropolis into a site of global tourism as
well as an object reproduced in postcards, small sculptures, and trinkets.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
He opposed the idealization and commercialization of antiquity,
its conversion into both national shrine and house of capitalist
prostitution. This repugnance with mass culture is surely one of
the chief characteristics of modernism. As John Carey has shown,
modernists reacted with hostility to the emergence of mass culture and
such phenomena as suburbs, tourism, tabloids, and comic books.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Actually they had a contradictory relationship with their audience,
condemning it for crassness while yearning for recognition. This
position, perhaps always defining the modern artist, was particularly
acute for radicals like Calas whose progressive politics took the
opposite direction of their elitist, highly formalized, and abstract
aesthetics.
<p>
Thus Calas still remained committed to the purity of aesthetic forms,
to an unadorned Doric temple, free from the banality of flags and
guidebooks. His critique of the archaeological project of restoration
and its cheap exploitation of classical monuments resembles that of
later writers like Macaulay and Woodward. Although Calas did not long,
as they do, for a Parthenon that still bears the accumulation of time
and nature, he believed in the primacy of the original. This explains
why Calas focused so much attention in his poem on the click-clack of the
cameras, the rolls of film, and the floodlights. The cameras for him led
to the kitsch reproduction of the temple, "killing it with their lens,"
leaving it "dead" and "fake."
<p>
Modernism and archaeology were, as I noted earlier, both products of
the same aesthetic and philosophical developments of the eighteenth
century. Ultimately both relied on the concept of pure aesthetic form
and on the majesty of the original over the copy. Even though high
modernism put into doubt many social institutions, it reserved a special
place, beyond contingency and decay, for beautiful forms. Likewise,
the disciplinary rationale of archaeology was its capacity to unearth
ever more Greek originals to house in museums packed with less desirable
Roman copies. It is not a coincidence that Calas reacted so violently
to the intrusion of the cameras on the Acropolis and the exploitation
of the Parthenon in advertising. The new technologies of reproduction
threatened, as Walter Benjamin noted, the aesthetic aura of art.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
From our perspective we have come to understand that this aura has hardly
been tarnished. If anything, photography and new electronic modes of
reproduction have reinforced the power and appeal of the original. We
see this in the high prices commanded by original works of art and the
magic allure of masterpieces like the bust of Nefertiti and the Mona
Lisa, or original documents such as the Magna Carta and the American
Declaration of Independence. All of these are approached with religious
veneration. The power of the original, to use an example from Greek
archaeology, can be seen in the decision by the Metropolitan Museum to
purchase an extraordinary krater by the master vase-painter Euphronius
depicting the dead body of the Homeric


<b></b>


hero, Sarpedon. The museum's desire for a vase by this painter was
so great that it paid a million dollars for it in 1972 and for years
highlighted its significance by displaying it alone in a darkened room.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Calas's attack on the camera represented his attempt to preserve the
uniqueness of the original from modernity's propensity towards endless
duplication and trivialization. But Calas could not escape modernity. On
the contrary, he recognized its inevitability. That he juxtaposed Kodak
film and the Parthenon in a work of high literature, something that
previously would have been seen as blasphemous, shows that the past and
the present are one. Despite the efforts by archaeologists to fence off
classical monuments from the city's inhabitants, these people arrived
in droves to observe, photograph, or pray. And quite often they came
on the tram. Such is gist of the poem significantly titled, "Tram and
Acropolis," by the surrealist poet, Nikos Engonopoulos (1910-1985):

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
How sorrowful it would have been&#x02014;my God&#x02014;
<br />
How sorrowful,
<br />
If the hope of the marbles
<br />
Had not consoled my heart
<br />
And the expectation of a bright ray of light
<br />
That would give new life
<br />
To these magnificent ruins.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

The joining together in Engonopoulos's poem of the tram and Parthenon,
of modernity with antiquity, shows the vitality of classical monuments
for modernist sensibilities. Furthermore, Engonopoulos did not see a
contradiction between surrealism and the classics. It is important to note
that the aim of modernism and archaeology was the modernization of Greek
society, as Artemis Leontis has demonstrated. Modern Greeks "claimed the
peninsula of Hellas with its classical sites to be their native workshop"
in order to fashion "an indigenous aesthetic." This project made antiquity
as well as archaeology vital "cornerstones of Neohellenism."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
The aim of both poets and archaeologists was to fashion a modernist
interpretation of antiquity. Ultimately they have created the modern
ruins of the Parthenon, free of all postclassical structures and debris
except for the seemingly perennial scaffolding, the permanent fences,
and the glare of the lights at night.
<p>
With the click-clack of cameras, the prattle of guides, and the crowds
pushing towards the exit, perhaps the committed traveler can no longer
have a romantic experience of ruins. Birds are no longer allowed to
nest along the pediments, and bats avoid the bright lights. But poets
are still attracted to antiquity and still discover their own angle.
<p>
It is with playful detachment that the contemporary American poet,
A. E. Stallings, sees the past in her poem "Consolation for Tamar&#x02014;on
the occasion of her breaking an ancient pot":

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You know I am no archaeologist, Tamar,
<br />
And that to me it is all one dust or another.
<br />
Still, it must mean something to survive the weather


<b></b>


<br />
Of the Ages&#x02014;earthquake, flood, and war&#x02014;
<br />
Only to shatter in your very hands.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Archaeology and tourism may have robbed ruins of their mysticism, but we
are still in awe of something that has survived thousands of years. And
we wonder still whether we should display the shards as they are or
reconstruct the pot.

The steady accumulation of this physical evidence began to challenge
the dominance philology ascribed to texts as sources of knowledge about

Archaeology and Modernity

<p>
Archaeology was born of modernity. Indeed, it helped shape it. There
are many ways to define modernity, but the very word indicates
that the concept of time is central&#x02014;modernity as a new way
of conceptualizing time that emerged around the sixteenth century,
specifically the perception of the present as distinct from the past:
the break with tradition.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Alongside this temporal fracture was a new sense of history or historical
consciousness that attempted to mend this break, but which was however
faced with an inherent paradox: before modernity, understanding of
the past had come through tradition, yet in breaking with tradition,
with the past, modernity now had to find another way of understanding
it. This was a problem faced by all Renaissance scholars in whatever
field, a problem which was ultimately resolved by invoking the authority
of reason (Descartes) and the senses (Bacon) against tradition, including
religion. Understanding the past, particularly the human past of history,
presented a particularly acute instance of this paradox, for it involved
breaking from the very thing that was to be understood. The only way
to respond was either to study the past through a critical analysis
of traditional sources (history) or to find <i>other</i> sources,
another authority; and this meant, above all, <i>material culture</i>
(archaeology).
<p>
The antiquarians of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even eighteenth
centuries played a critical role in articulating the project of modernity,
for it was they who discovered a past previously unknown to tradition
through the recognition of an ancient European


<b></b>


material culture. It is too easy to forget the specific social and
intellectual conditions which define archaeology. With all sense
of the past coming from what had been handed down, it must have
seemed near impossible to find an independent and alternative way of
understanding. The significant thing about the recognition of this ancient
material culture was that it was based on observation and comparison with
<i>contemporary</i> objects. Just as it was realized that fossils were
the remains of once living organisms, so it was realized that prehistoric
objects were the material culture of once living societies. The example of
thunderstones illustrates this perfectly. These objects were originally
interpreted as "solidified lightning" and viewed as natural objects; we
now recognize them as stone axes, dating back over four thousand years. It
was only when Europe began its global expansion and encountered people
living in very different conditions and using very different material
culture&#x02014;but one which included objects that looked like those found
buried in European soil&#x02014;that the possibility of their human origin
was raised.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
Despite the increasing amount of empirical work conducted on ancient
remains during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the contradiction
between breaking with the past and depending upon it remained acute. In
facing this new past, which was opened up by analogies with the present,
the antiquarians did not develop the means to understand it much
further until the nineteenth century. They were, for all intents and
purposes, forced back onto what tradition&#x02014;specifically written
texts&#x02014;said, and so they fitted the new discoveries into this
framework. Classical and biblical texts spoke of stone tools, just as
the world, according to Archbishop Ussher's famous calculations, began
only in 4004 <small>B.C</small>. The idea of prehistory&#x02014;of a past
radically earlier than written history&#x02014;was unacceptable, if not
inconceivable, until the nineteenth century. The great antiquity of
the earth and of human culture was realized only when&#x02014;similarly
using analogies with the present&#x02014;the layering of rocks and
soil in the earth (stratigraphy) replaced traditional sources (such
as biblical genealogies) as a guide to chronology. Combined with
the development of typology&#x02014;the classification of prehistoric
artifacts&#x02014;antiquarians now had the beginnings of a method for
interrogating this new past; they could also give the final death blow
to the antimodernists by claiming a past which existed even before
tradition: prehistory.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The idea of prehistory is in many ways the epitome of the modernist
project: the creation of a past which has no connection to traditional
history. Moreover, prehistory was not just a new past, it was also a
lost past&#x02014;lost to traditional forms of memory, whether written or
spoken. For the new historical consciousness, prehistory was perhaps the
greatest challenge and yet perhaps its greatest asset; on the one hand,
it was a past which tradition has forgotten, and no amount of critical
analysis of traditional texts would recover it. On the other, precisely
for this reason, it was a past purified of all taint of tradition. It
was a clean slate. The concept of prehistory is incredibly radical, and
yet today we do not give it too much thought. Prehistory was about a time
before text. We tend to think of prehistory as simply the recognition of a
chronological period, a time before history, where history is the written
or spoken word. Yet the "before" of prehistory is not just temporal,
it is also ontological (though the two are


<b></b>


related). Prehistory is not solely about chronological priority, it is
also about the ontological priority of material culture before text. It
was not simply that archaeologists were forced to rely on material culture
to interpret this new past&#x02014;the modernist project <i>demanded</i>
it. It was an alternative path to constructing a new authority and
foundation for understanding the past that did not rely on tradition
(i.e., texts). Let me be clear here though: I am not suggesting some
absolute priority of material culture over text, but a contingent one,
according to the disciplinary context. In absolute terms, if I can use
this phrase at all, the issue was making material culture the equal of
text&#x02014;and more than its equal: independent of it. But in the specific
context of archaeology, material culture was to have the upper hand.
<p>
While the implications of this role of material culture have been long
recognized in archaeology, they have not been connected to the concept
of prehistory. In fact, ironically, most archaeologists continue to
consider the concept of prehistory as primarily a chronological concept:
the time before writing.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Yet to appreciate fully the radical nature of the modernist project, the
ontological status of prehistory needs to be properly considered. The
word <i>prehistory</i> was only invented in the mid-nineteenth century
and it caused some ripples at the time; other words were even considered
for this "new" past, such as <i>antehistory</i>. Given the phonetic
similarity to <i>antihistory,</i> perhaps this would have been more
apt. But then, perhaps this would have underlined the break between
traditional history and the new history too much.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet the break was always more than a temporal one: prehistory was, above
all, history studied through material culture, not through texts. This
characterization deliberately blurs the distinction between method and
material. It relocates the split between prehistory and history from
chronology to ontology. This means that even archaeologists studying
the material culture of the historic past&#x02014;medieval Britain or
colonial America&#x02014;are doing prehistory, not history.
<p>
That archaeologists do not think this way&#x02014;that the idea of
prehistory is reduced to a chronological concept&#x02014;is problematic. To
some, this may seem a mere question of semantics, but I think it signals
an underlying lack of confidence in the archaeological project. To insist
on the limited definition of prehistory as a time before text is to ignore
the ontological status of material culture vis-&#x000E0;-vis text. It has
been pointed out that when archaeologists suddenly opened up the vast
period of prehistory in the nineteenth century, they ironically tried to
reduce it to a simulacrum of the present through ethnographic analogies:
prehistory was peopled by societies similar to contemporary savages. For
Tim Murray, this is almost a betrayal of the initial achievement of the
discovery of a new past.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
This is an important issue, yet I think the irony is even greater than
Murray indicates: first, the discovery of this "new past" was founded
on exactly such analogies&#x02014;actualistic studies informed the very
recognition of thunderstones as stone axes, of deep stratigraphy as
long chronologies. Without such contemporary analogies in the first
place, there would have been no "discovery" of the antiquity of human
culture. Second and more significantly, the "discovery" of prehistory
was not just the discovery of a long chronology. It was the discovery of
a new method of understanding the past: the analysis of material culture.


<b></b>


<p>
What I find really interesting about the history of archaeology is
how many of its key developments were linked to the key contradiction
of modernity: the need to understand the past without relying on it
as a source of authority. Archaeology resolved this contradiction,
on the one hand, by creating a <i>new</i> or different kind of past
from that laid down by tradition: prehistory; and, on the other,
by creating a <i>new</i> way of understanding the past: the study of
material culture. The two are closely connected, especially through the
wider social context in which these concepts emerged&#x02014;particularly
capitalism. Through mercantile capitalism, the expansion of European
people around the world, particularly the discovery of the New World,
produced material analogies for those "curiosities" of the Old World
such as thunderstones. Through industrial capitalism, the development
of mass production and consumption provided a new way of understanding
material culture, through the notion of the serial object, which changes
through time. Archaeological typologies were quite explicitly inspired
by mid-nineteenth-century exhibitions of this new material culture,
which arranged objects according to series.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
These social conditions not only provided the means for one solution
to the contradiction of modernity; they also provided the context for
actually thinking in a modern way in the first place. Indeed, one cannot
really separate these issues, and in fact one might define modernity
as the persistence of this dialectic.
<p>
This can be seen in archaeology's continued dilemma about the relation
between the present and the past. As mentioned earlier, there is a
disturbing question surrounding our knowledge of prehistory: on the
one hand, it was defined as a new past, a new time, but on the other,
it can only be understood (and was created) through analogies (direct
or indirect) with the present. The concept of analogy articulates this
dialectic well. However, archaeologists are forever uneasy about such
ambiguities and concurrently developed a means to conceal this dilemma,
as if the line between past and present were not a slash but a hyphen. If
analogy represents the modernist divide of past/present, chronology
represents the modernist patch of a historical consciousness linking
past-present. In short, archaeology created its own mode of time&#x02014;a
temporalization which is not necessarily unique to archaeology (except in
its details), but which nonetheless serves to plaster over the fracture
between present and past by creating a specific time in which material
culture resides. The oldest mode of archaeological temporalization
was the narrative of evolution, which placed all material culture in
a progressive sequence from savagery to civilization. This model has
been continually refined since the eighteenth century, and is still
employed by many archaeologists today, especially in North America,
albeit in a very modified form. However, evolutionism has not always
been in favor and its popularity varies with time and the place. On the
other hand, basic chronology&#x02014;whether drawn from radiocarbon dates,
dendrochronology, or typology&#x02014;remains a fundamental part of the
discipline. Periodization in particular&#x02014;from the Paleolithic to the
Iron Age&#x02014;has remained a key device for structuring this material
culture, and even while many archaeologists may have abandoned the grand
narratives of social evolution, it is hard to imagine the discipline ever
abandoning chronology in some form. It is chronology which provides the
most successful temporalization, for it embraces all material culture
within a universal


<b></b>


temporality, and makes us believe that the prehistoric past is joined
to the present through a shared, universal time.
<p>
However, we need to be conscious of the political consequences of this
kind of historical consciousness, and the political nature of time
it incorporates.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Archaeology has of course been closely tied to nationalism and the
formation of nation-states whether or not it is explicitly used to
create origin stories:
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
archaeology&#x02014;ironically&#x02014;as the invention of traditions. The
politics of nationalism are often&#x02014;though not always&#x02014;quite
transparent. But archaeology has always also been a modernist project,
as this paper has discussed, and one which investigates pasts beyond
national frontiers, as the science of the history of humankind. The
politics of this humanism have been less transparent. The problem
with this vision of archaeology as part of modernity and the project
of humanism lies in its politics of time&#x02014;as Foucault has so
minutely deconstructed in his genealogies of European history. For if
archaeology is seen as one of the guardians of our time-consciousness,
maintaining the temporal continuity or link with the past of humanity,
what implications does this have for archaeology vis-&#x000E0;-vis
<i>other</i> histories, other strategies of cultural remembrance? The
question is whether this concept of time-consciousness does not claim
some special and universal status, for its totalizing vision would seem
to erase or denigrate other claims to the past. Archaeology as part of
the hegemony of a Western discourse on history, a scientific colonialism,
a <i>white mythology</i>.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Analogy and chronology represent archaeology's two articulations of
modernity as a temporal problem. While analogy expresses the fundamental
dilemma, chronology represents the primary solution. But what about
material culture? It is very much caught between these two articulations,
for on the one hand it represents something of both the past and the
present <i>simultaneously,</i> and on the other, it is captured within
time, belonging to a particular point or period: the stone axe as both
metaphor and concept. The textual articulation of material culture,
which has become a dominant feature of much archaeology since the 1980s,
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
is perhaps a little ironic given the association between material
culture and prehistory discussed earlier. Indeed, we need to remind
ourselves of a key axis in the concept of prehistory: as a time before
writing&#x02014;not "before" in a chronological or temporal sense,
but "before" in an ontological sense. Of course one needs to be
wary of associations with Heideggerian concepts of primordiality,
for the priority being asserted here&#x02014;as I have already
mentioned&#x02014;is not absolute but contingent, and related to a
methodological strategy. But as with the restricted, chronological
conception of prehistory, I think many archaeologists are also
working with a restricted conception of material culture that makes
it secondary or supplemental to language, or "mental culture" if you
like. To illustrate this, I want to turn towards the archaeology of
modernity, towards an archaeological analysis of modernity. For here it
is possible to see how archaeology has for a long time either ignored
or marginalized an archaeology of the modern period. In doing this,
I hope to return to the question of material culture with a revitalized
sense of its significance to archaeology.

Archaeologies of Modernity
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
The grating of metal teeth on concrete, the pounding of a breaker,
dust and noise&#x02014;typical sights and sounds on the initial stages of
any urban excavation, as mechanical excavators rip up modern surfaces
and foundations. It is normal practice on archaeological excavations,
particularly those in cities and so-called "brownfield" (i.e., built-up)
areas, for the upper layers of a site to be machined or dug away in order
to get down to the "archaeology." Tarmac surfaces, concrete foundations,
or service pipe trenches all constitute what is often called "modern
disturbance" and if they are recorded at all, it is as a blank zone, their
sole importance defined as an area of truncated archaeology&#x02014;that
is, of <i>no</i> archaeology. On reflection, one should of course ask
why these features are excluded from consideration as archaeological
remains, and the usual answer is, "they are <i>too</i> modern." But what
is "too modern"? The question is critical because by default, it also
raises the question of what is "the archaeological." Indeed it is as if a
major barrier separates the modern from the archaeological gaze. Why are
archaeologists usually uninterested in such material remains&#x02014;is it
a question of chronology, disciplinary boundaries, or is there a more
concealed issue of ontology and temporality implicated in this simple
phrase&#x02014;"too modern"?
<p>
Ironically, throughout most of its history archaeology has not given
much attention to the material culture and remains of the very period
in which it was born and grew up, its contemporary past. Indeed, it
has only been since the late twentieth century&#x02014;that "postmodern
period"&#x02014;that anything like an active research interest in this
vein has developed. Of course in different countries there are different
responses to this problem&#x02014;in Europe, archaeologies of the modern
world are very poorly developed ("too modern" is regularly applied as
far back as the eighteenth century);
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
but in North America, by contrast, the archaeology of the eighteenth,
nineteenth, and twentieth centuries is a thriving subdiscipline. Indeed,
explorations of the role of material culture in the development of
capitalism and global expansion&#x02014;the very processes connected to
the rise of modernity&#x02014;have formed a core part of some of the most
exciting archaeology being done in the United States.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
The reasons for this regional disparity no doubt relate to broader social
issues about the role of archaeology in society. Is it any coincidence
that North American archaeologists&#x02014;mostly white, of European
descent&#x02014;should start using archaeology to explore their "own"
past? Indeed, one might suggest there is a clear postcolonial geopolitics
operating in this focus on the archaeology of the modern world: globally,
the most active research of the modern period occurs precisely in those
former colonies where the European-derived population is or has been
politically or numerically dominant (such as North America or Australia)
in contrast to those where the indigenous population regained power
(such as India or other countries in southeast Asia).
<p>
Yet the more insistent question is perhaps not why the archaeology of
the past three centuries is stronger in some former colonies than others,
but why it is so weak in the colonial homeland of Europe. This is slowly
changing, but it is a long time coming and the resistance is not so much
active as passive: it never really occurred to us that this


<b></b>


was an important avenue for archaeology. Not that there has not
been&#x02014;and still is&#x02014;some active resistance, especially
when faced with issues of priority; I have no doubt that if you
asked ten archaeologists what was more important, a Neolithic or a
nineteenth-century site, nine of them (if not ten) would probably say
the former&#x02014;without hesitation. Yet why do we value the remains
of the past in this way? Is it simply that <i>older is better?</i> Or
is it perhaps something else&#x02014;a fear of getting too close to the
present? There is, I suppose, a threat of ridicule entangled in this fear
of the present, because no matter how much archaeology might be defined
by its set of methods and its focus on material culture, it retains a
strong sense that its subject matter is the past; indeed, that instead of
moving forward in time, it should be moving backward in time, exploring
the darkest depths of prehistory. But at the same time, putting a date
on the limits of archaeology also seems ludicrous. Why stop at 1750,
1800, 1900, or 2003? Indeed, given the variability in national, local,
and individual responses to the archaeology of the past three hundred
years, it should already be clear that this cannot be a chronological
question. That is, there can be no date or time after which we might
say that this is no longer archaeology, even though many archaeologists
routinely do this in practice, if not on principle. But if it is not a
question of chronology, then what is it that creates such resistance to
an archaeology of modernity?
<p>
A typical response is often: "We have masses of textual and testimonial
sources from which to address the history of the recent past, so why
bother with archaeology?" I have heard many people&#x02014;archaeologists
and nonarchaeologists&#x02014;use this argument, and I think it is an
irony bordering on tragedy. What happened to the radical project of
modernity and its attempt to put material culture on an independent
basis for understanding the past? It is as if these people have no idea
what archaeology is about. For if you use this argument, then you also
accept that archaeology will always be in the shadow of documentary and
oral-led history or ethnography and is effectively the poorest and most
pathetic of all historical or social disciplines. If you use this line,
you should not be an archaeologist at all. Many archaeologists had to
go through this argument in the mid-twentieth century, whether they were
studying medieval Britain or colonial America, and I would hope that few
would actually maintain this position today. Yet it is still heard, even
from within the discipline. This is not to deny the value of using textual
and other sources in historical archaeology. Rather the point is the power
of material culture. I mention this moreover not so much to lament the
theoretically vacuous position some might hold, but to highlight the close
relationship material culture has with textuality, or discursivity. I want
to explore the nature of material culture and the project of archaeology
through this opposition; to put it in rather negative terms&#x02014;using
negativity as a <i>positive</i> concept&#x02014;to explore material culture
as the nondiscursive, the nontextual.
<p>
The one place to explore this question best I believe is to focus on
an archaeology of modernity as contemporaneity: the archaeology of the
present, or, as it has been called elsewhere, the "contemporary past."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
For even while many archaeologists may accept the importance of an
archaeology of the modern period, even of twentieth-century archaeology,
some still stop when it comes to doing the archaeology of <i>now</i>. Is
it


<b></b>


even possible to do this kind of archaeology? Does the archaeological
context not have to be, by definition, <i>dead?</i> Archaeology as
autopsy. Consider this: even if archaeologists decided to pay attention
to the very surface of an urban site&#x02014;the tarmac, the service pipes,
the concrete&#x02014;why should it stop there? Why do the archaeologists
leave the site once all the cultural material traces have been dealt with,
when new ones might be being constructed in their place? What would it
be like if archaeologists stayed to analyze the construction of the new
building being erected on that urban plot&#x02014;and then stayed to examine
its occupation and use . . . and possibly its eventual destruction and
replacement by another building. An archaeologist could devote her whole
life to the material history of just one site.
<p>
This is a provocative idea, though some skeptics might question whether
such a project is archaeology. Well, actually I do not care. And I am not
sure many people care that much about disciplinary purity, which is surely
the only reason for engaging in such debate. Archaeologists have been
borrowing for decades and are increasingly exploring interdisciplinary
spaces&#x02014;just look at this volume. What is more important here is the
nature of material culture in relation to the archaeological method. What
does it mean to perform archaeology on a living context rather than a dead
one? Archaeology has routinely been doing this since the 1960s, and less
systematically before that time. What is called <i>ethnoarchaeology</i>
is an established subfield of archaeology where archaeologists study
living societies to help them interpret dead ones. In such a case,
ethnoarchaeology is largely seen as methodological: it helps us to
reflect on our methods. But an archaeology of a living society also has
a very different role. It reflects back, not on the discipline but on
contemporary society at large. The archaeology of the present might be
characterized as a two-way mirror: on the one hand, we could just see
it as a mirror, held up to our own discipline (as in ethnoarchaeology);
on the other, we could try to see it as a window onto wider society,
albeit an obscure rather than a transparent one. This use of archaeology
is much harder; it requires much more effort, for we have first to ignore
its reflective properties and, second, to struggle to see through to the
other side. Indeed, ironically, it is perhaps the reflection of ourselves
which is the most difficult obstacle to overcome in this process.
<p>
What kind of archaeology looks through the mirror? There are any number
of examples one could choose,
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
but let me focus on just two: garbology and forensic
archaeology. Garbology is the study of people's rubbish, pioneered
by William Rathje, from which critical understanding is gained of a
community's habits of consumption and waste.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
One of the more interesting aspects of this "project" is the frequent
incongruity between what people said and thought about their consumption
habits and what they actually did, as revealed by an examination of their
trash cans. It is not simply about people lying or deluding themselves;
it is about the significance of nondiscursive behavior in people's
lives. It is about material culture. And what applies on an individual
level applies equally on a social level, as similar studies of landfills
have demonstrated. Forensic archaeology involves a similar revelation,
but in the field of criminal behavior. Archaeologists are increasingly
being drawn into cases of civil and war crimes, where they serve as
part of the judicial process. Archaeologists have,


<b></b>


for example, worked on the bodies and graves of serial killers' victims,
or have participated in the excavation and analysis of mass graves around
the world.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Once again, it is dealing with contexts in which discursivity is either
absent or intentionally suppressed.
<p>
The nature of archaeology in these examples might be described
as a presencing of absence&#x02014;or making discursive the
nondiscursive. Archaeology as exploring the prehistory of the present,
where the word "prehistory" invokes the radical ontological meaning given
earlier in this paper. For our world is not transparent; it is not fully
constituted: there are gaps, shadows, silences, and absences which are
not simply outside of discourse, but are often structurally excluded
by discourse. And here I want to introduce a notion of archaeology as
<i>an engagement with the unconstituted present</i>. If we can call
this unconstituted present a prehistory, then I would suggest even
further that this is exactly what all prehistory is, indeed what all
archaeology engages with, whether excavating Neolithic burial mounds
or late-twentieth-century landfills. The objects that archaeologists
study are unearthed and existing <i>in the present</i>&#x02014;even
if they can be said to have been made and buried in the past. To be
clear: this is not to deny the age of objects, or their historicity,
merely the temporal bracketing which would reduce the temporality
of an object to <i>another</i> time&#x02014;such as the Bronze Age or
the Neolithic. Prehistoric artifacts are <i>contemporary objects</i>,
as much as the latest Nokia cell phone or BMW. Indeed, archaeologists
routinely bring new things into the world through their excavations, and
these add to the material culture of contemporary society&#x02014;even
if they are tightly contained in museum cases, or concealed in
archives. Archaeologists, above all, engage with the unconstituted
present and attempt to make it part of a discourse.
<p>
How is this constitution performed? Critically and most momentously,
through the act of fieldwork. Archaeology is a materializing
activity&#x02014;it does not simply work with material things,
it <i>materializes</i>. It brings new things into the world; it
reconres the world. The public watches on as slowly over the weeks
a Viking longhouse emerges from the soil. To the public&#x02014;indeed
to archaeologists&#x02014;the rhetoric of the dig is about exposure,
uncovering what has been buried. But this seriously misrepresents the
creative process of excavation. A rhetoric of sculpture, of design, might
be equally apt. The archaeological site as a gestalt image: sculpted
or buried? Would the passer-by be able to tell? Would you? Of course
in a Platonic epistemology, the sculptor is only uncovering what was
already there anyway, inherent in the material; perhaps archaeology is no
different. But I think the issue is not about the end product as much as
the process; not about what is made, but the process of making. Moreover,
archaeology viewed as an act of materializing also incorporates the act
of translation, which is often less noticeable. The passer-by now sees
an archaeologist making a drawing of the sculpted/buried remains, making
notes, taking photographs. She witnesses the process of translation from
object to image/text.
<p>
This is not simply a case of representation either, despite
what archaeological orthodoxy would say. Rather it is a <i>double
materialization</i>, where both excavation and translation constitute each
other. The way the site is excavated is largely performed with reference
to the way it will be recorded; for example, sections of earth are cut


<b></b>


vertically in preparation for drawing the layers; pegs are put in the
ground to reference gridded drafting paper; lines are scored around
layers, like pencil on paper. Which is representing which? Excavations
and even laboratories are the sites where this unconstituted present
is engaged, and made discursive. The nature of this discursivity is
not given in the nature of the materials either but is something which
has to be performed; archaeology is just <i>one</i> performance. Others
are possible: even on the same site other materializations could take
place. The question is, should archaeology be worried by this possibility?

Modern Archaeology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Ultimately, this brings us back to the beginning of this paper and the
contradictions of modernity. The core dilemma of modernity was how to
understand the world without turning to tradition&#x02014;how to find a new
authority which resided outside of tradition&#x02014;effectively, outside
of time. As part of this search for a new authority in studying the past,
archaeology developed the analysis of material culture which subsequently
produced in the nineteenth century the concept of a new past. Prehistory
was this new past, unrelated to tradition and paradoxically, a <i>very
modern</i> past. Yet its meaning was always rendered ambiguous through
the connection to the present, through analogy, an ambiguity which is
concealed by chronology. An archaeology of the present, of modernity
as the contemporary, however, raises a new conception of prehistory. It
unsettles the role of chronology by once again focusing on analogy. Only
instead of seeing an archaeology of the present as analogical (i.e.,
ethnoarchaeology), it demands we see it as an engagement with the
unconstituted present. The present is no longer an analogy for the past,
it is the field in which pasts are constituted. Prehistory should no
longer be viewed as a new past, but rather a new present&#x02014;rather the
performance of presencing. The significance of material culture is no
longer about a new authority or foundation for understanding the world
(specifically the past), but about a critique of any absolute authority
or foundationalism. Depending on your perspective, this is archaeology
as an antimodernist, postmodernist or, simply, late modernist project.
<p>
The implications of this conception also explode the restricted notion
of archaeology as the search for knowledge. Archaeology is often seen
as simply an academic discipline, producing authoritative knowledge
about the past. But however you characterize or contest the nature of
such knowledge (or the past), it is also important to recognize that
archaeology is a mode of cultural production: a cultural work.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Archaeology is important to most societies in the world today because
it contributes to a broader educational project about national and
even universal identities: who are we? It can be exploited to support
nationalistic ideologies (as was the case in Nazi Germany)
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
or critique them. It also serves more recreational functions as
entertainment, either directly (e.g., a day at the museum) or indirectly
(e.g., technical advice on the latest Hollywood movie). One could no
doubt cite more roles; however, the route from the very specific and
highly specialized job of excavating, say a Viking house, to the wider
social reception of archaeological knowledge affecting people's lives
is long&#x02014;


<b></b>


often too long. Indeed, insofar as archaeology enhances people's lives
and society in general, its major impact might be said to lie in popular
culture rather than any noble vision of improving self-awareness. One
could debate the relative merit of these different roles of archaeology
in society&#x02014;should it be emancipatory or is it enough to be
entertaining? I do not want to address such questions here (though they
are exceedingly important), but rather argue that however one views its
cultural role, an archaeology of the present opens up a much broader
forum for cultural work, and one whose relevance is potentially immediate
rather than distant.
<p>
In many ways, it is through exploring the interstitial spaces between
cultural projects that archaeology can expand most; conventionally,
by viewing itself primarily as an academic discipline, archaeology
has perceived its limits to lie on the border of other academic
disciplines&#x02014;history, anthropology, or geography, for example. But
archaeology's limits go far beyond academia&#x02014;it can equally explore
its relation to other fields of cultural production, such as art or
theater. Indeed, these have been explored through dialogues between
individuals from their respective fields, such as Colin Renfrew and Mark
Dion on art,
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
or Michael Shanks and Michael Pearson on theater.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
And then why not similar dialogues between archaeologists and
construction engineers or architects? (I am not talking about
practical issues of conservation or mitigation, but about theoretical
issues regarding the significance of the built environment.) The
possibilities are endless, as is the field of archaeology. Moreover,
such a perspective deconstructs the hierarchy of knowledge, which
privileges the didactic role of archaeology. For the cultural value of
archaeology lies not solely in the grand narratives of the past. It
is not just in synthetic works, popular books, museums, or heritage
sites that archaeology performs its cultural work. Any segment or
part of archaeological practice, even its most scientific, mundane
operations, is potentially able to participate in a wider cultural
project. The projects I discussed earlier, garbology and forensics,
have much broader and rather different cultural implications and
social relevance than traditional archaeology. Extending the notion
of archaeology to a more generalized concept of cultural critique and
redemption, archaeology can be likened to an act of therapy on a social
level. It can help a community or even a whole nation come to terms with
and understand key social problems, such as a sudden tragic event (e.g.,
war crimes) or a more long-term, structural malaise (social deprivation
and inequality). This is archaeology breaking the boundaries of its
normal role in cultural work. This is modern archaeology.

<p>
Georges Bataille's <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance de l'art</i> (Lascaux,
or the Birth of Art) is a commissioned work.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
And, like all commissioned works, <i>Lascaux</i> bears the scars
of compromise. To a reader well-versed in Bataille's major works of
the 1930s, however, the large-format, lushly illustrated volume of
1955 appears almost lacerated, a patchwork of textual summaries (of
Johan Huizinga's <i>Homo Ludens</i> and Roger Caillois's <i>L'Homme
et le sacr&#x000E9;</i>, for instance) roughly stitched together at the
seams. Bataille seems to have set himself the ambitious task of fitting
all the pieces together, reconciling a generation of speculations on
Paleolithic image-making with his own already well-developed theories
on the implication of art in religious action. Many of Bataille's most
faithful readers have found his study of "prehistoric art" disappointing,
signaling a "retrenchment" rather than an advance.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In Jay Caplan's words, Bataille's arguments in <i>Lascaux</i> are all
too "familiar,"
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
while for Michel Surya the work as a whole is "of less interest" than
the contemporaneous <i>La souverainet&#x000E9;</i>  or <i>Ma
m&#x000E8;re</i> .
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
In contrast, I will argue here that <i>Lascaux</i> is indeed a significant
book, not only in its own right but also as a precursor to contemporary
archaeology's most seminal meditations on images and signs. Bataille
is the first in a line of post-structuralist thinkers to exhibit a
fascination with the origins and the social dynamics of mark-marking
in general. That fascination is allowed greater scope in <i>Lascaux</i>
than elsewhere because the scientific discourse the French refer to as
"la pr&#x000E9;histoire" is the sphere in which questions concerning the
social function of mark-making,


<b></b>


mark-making's relation to art, art's relation to magic ritual, and
ritual's constitutive relation to "the human," can all be raised
in a scholarly and even forensic context. <i>Lascaux</i> is more
provocative than it first appears not because it overtly attacks or
transgresses disciplinary conventions, but rather because it engages
with an academic discourse in a way that is unprecedented in Bataille's
career and that therefore throws into high relief the hermeneutic value
of the interdisciplinary encounter. In <i>Lascaux,</i> Bataille is less
concerned with miming (to perverse effect) social science's methodology
and epistemology than he is with mining its resources.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
For the field of prehistory offered salient challenges to the dominant
Western conception of "art," fueling Bataille's larger goal of rethinking
aesthetic behavior within broad social contexts. Bataille's attitude
toward the academic discipline of prehistory&#x02014;a concoction of
archaeology, history of religion, ethnography, physical anthropology,
and art history&#x02014;is therefore not antagonistic when compared,
for instance, to the attitude he assumes toward the social sciences
in the early essays of <i>Documents</i>. And this is so not only
because <i>Lascaux</i> is intended for "le grand public" but, more
importantly, because the interdisciplinary field of prehistory forges
connections between different spheres of human behavior (such as art,
sacred ritual, mimesis, and trance) that confirm rather than contest
the primary impulses informing Bataille's own project.
<p>
Further, as opposed to <i>L'&#x000C9;rotisme,</i> which makes use
of some of the same materials, the Lascaux book anchors Bataille's
conceptual apparatus&#x02014;patchwork as it is&#x02014;in a specific viewing
experience. Bataille <i>looks</i> at the walls of the cave and this act of
vision does not support "a coherent interpretation" of discrete res,
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
but instead leaves him bewildered before a confusing tableau of tangled
and superimposed lines, a mass of indecipherable images leading
him to the very limits of vision understood as the discrimination
of forms in a bounded space. When he publishes <i>L'Erotisme</i> in
1957, he recalls only the most clearly defined depiction found in the
Lascaux cave, a stick re of a man beside a speared bison known by
prehistorians as the "Scene in the Shaft" (or "la Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits")
(<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Again in 1959 Bataille returns to this
depiction in <i>Les Larmes d'Eros</i> (The Tears of Eros), reiterating
an interpretation of the re that had by then been placed in question
but which fit with the theory of art as transgression that Bataille
was still pursuing.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<i>Lascaux</i>&#x02014;along with the preliminary drafts&#x02014;provides
the only record we have of Bataille's firsthand, eyewitness account of
the cave. The dominant impression it records is not one of conceptual
mastery over the decipherable depictions but of vertiginous confusion
before the "jumble" (<i>embrouillimini</i>) of superimposed res
(<i>L,</i> 55). Repeatedly, Bataille finds himself at a loss before the
"tangled [<i>enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;e</i>] and often almost illegible
engravings" (<i>L,</i> 47), the "heavy red bovines . . . which
encroach upon [<i>qui empi&#x000E8;tent sur</i>] the hooves and the
breasts of the bulls" (<i>L,</i> 59), and scenes in which one animal
is "covered over" by another, indecipherable re (<i>L,</i> 47)
(<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Curiously, however, the phenomenon of
superimposition as it is treated in <i>Lascaux</i> goes unnoticed by
critics of Bataille's work.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet superimposition, as an index of aesthetic intention, is at the
center of Bataille's reflections in <i>Lascaux</i> (and at the center
of many contemporary treatments of Paleolithic imagery as well). The
"Scene in the Shaft," which has preoccupied a large number


<b></b>


of Bataille scholars, is actually not the depiction at Lascaux that
Bataille's eyes find most compelling. And in the end, it is his eyes,
located in a viewing body, that reveal to him the aspect of Paleolithic
image-making most crucial to the affirmation of a more innovative theory
of art and its origins, one that links image-making to the rhythmic
repetition of inscriptive gestures.<br />

<p>
Critics such as Steven Ungar, Suzanne Guerlac, and Lars Iyer have in
part misconstrued Bataille's project in <i>Lascaux</i> because they have
read it exclusively through the lens of Bataille's <i>philosophical</i>
preoccupations, and, more specifically, only insofar as


<b></b>


these preoccupations can be situated within a Heideggerian aesthetic
tradition extended in the direction of Blanchot.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
When Bataille is seen to depart from a strictly Heideggerian tradition,
as in Denis Hollier's or Rosalind Krauss's readings, he is presumed
to do so only in order to replace the model of art's origins in
Greek architecture with a transgressive model of art's "primitive"
origins in graffiti-like defacements on the walls of French and
Spanish caves. Unfortunately, these critics have not sought to situate
Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> within the lesser-known context of archaeology,
anthropology, and the history of religion, the very disciplines with
which Bataille, in 1955, would have been in dialogue. Such a lacuna
deprives <i>Lascaux</i> of one of its most important insights (one that,
not incidentally, animates contemporary research in paleography as well):
that the origin of artistic behavior may lie not in the desire to depict
nor to alter, but rather in the urge to <i>move</i>, to displace the
body rhythmically, to model and expend kinetic energy choreographically,
and to leave traces of this choreography for a purpose that one may
choose to call "spiritual," "expressive," or "social," but which does
not necessarily, as Bataille discovers, manifest an urge to deface.
<p>
In short, previous critics have followed Bataille's itinerary
through European aesthetic philosophy or Durkheimian anthropology,
but they have neglected to trace his course through the scholarship on
Paleolithic image-making itself. I want to differentiate my own reading of
<i>Lascaux</i> from that of former critics precisely along these lines,
asking the questions, "How might Bataille be said to intervene in the
discipline of prehistory?" and "What effects might this intervention have
had on the development of Bataille's own understanding of art?" Reading
Bataille with the prehistorians, I will situate Bataille's argument,
methodology, and insights in relation to the disciplines specifically
concerned with ancient visual culture. My premise is that we will discover
more about the significance of Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> if we approach
it as grounded in and continuing the work of Paleolithic archaeology as
it investigates the cognitive and expressive conditions of possibility
for human mark-making on durable supports.

ce livre . . ."

</blockquote>

<p>
The field the French invented at the beginning of the nineteenth
century known as "la pr&#x000E9;histoire" was, during the 1950s, one
that permitted a great freedom of speculation. Because so little was
known about cultures existing more than thirty thousand years ago,
the so-called prehistorians were obliged to integrate a large dose of
metaphysics into their empirical methodology. It is therefore misleading
to assume, as does Ungar, that Bataille, any more than his contemporary
prehistorians, was "motivated . . . by a fascination that removes his
inquiry from any claims to practical knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
On the contrary, among prehistorians, the search for "practical
knowledge" was very often propelled, for better or for worse, by a type
of fascination that bears a strong resemblance to that exhibited by
Bataille. Many renowned prehistorians, such as the Abb&#x000E9; Henri
Breuil (to take only the most famous example) were in fact priests,
a class of investigators that can hardly be considered immune to
metaphysical speculation. As Margaret Conkey has noted, "priests were
motivated to be among the first discoverers,


<b></b>


to perhaps 'control' the discoveries," which concerned, after all,
for them, the "origins of religion."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
A close reading of the pertinent literature demonstrates that Bataille
models his own approach in <i>Lascaux</i> on that typically assumed
by the priest-cum-archaeologist (an approach refined to perfection
by Breuil). To a large extent, he faithfully follows the narrative
conventions of archaeological accounts and combines in similar ways a
vast array of tools: empirical data provided by ethnography, conceptual
frames drawn from philosophy and psychology, scenarios suggested by
physical anthropology, and, last but not least, perceptual routines
prescribed by archaeology and art history.
<p>
On the second page of <i>Lascaux</i>'s preface, Bataille provides an
indication of what his relationship to the discipline of prehistory will
be. "I have limited myself," he states, "to taking up the archaeological
givens [<i>les donn&#x000E9;es arch&#x000E9;ologiques</i>] such as they
have been established by the prehistorians" (<i>L,</i> 10). Despite
this disclaimer, however, in <i>Lascaux</i> Bataille is <i>not</i>
simply "taking up," without modification, the "donn&#x000E9;es
arch&#x000E9;ologiques" such as they have been established by the
prehistorians. First of all, the "donn&#x000E9;es arch&#x000E9;ologiques"
are themselves often self-contradictory, and the prehistorians are by
no means united in their understanding of what these "donn&#x000E9;es"
imply. Second, Bataille himself engages in a careful and nuanced
reexamination of these "donn&#x000E9;es," evaluating them not only with
reference to his preformed aesthetics, but also against what he sees
on the cave walls. Bataille does not remain enclosed within either his
own philosophical constructions on the one hand, or the speculations
of the prehistorians on the other. His aesthetic meditations take on a
certain weight because he tests them against acts of perception that,
I shall argue, involve both his optical organs and the body in which
they are housed. In other words, as opposed to a critic like Blanchot,
Bataille doesn't use the caves as a point of departure for Heideggerian
fantasizing; he actually visits them.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
He observes, notebook in hand (see <a href="#3"> 3</a>),
and this experiential relation adds freshness to a perspective that
could easily have become congealed. Bataille's somatic experience of
the cave&#x02014;the fact that he not only examines the cave's surfaces
but also places his body between them&#x02014;gives him a knowledge he
would not otherwise have. It is this personal experience of the caves,
a sensual, somatic knowledge of them&#x02014;and not an unmediated
application of his favorite philosophemes&#x02014;that allows Bataille
to produce an original account of Lascaux, one that, as we shall see,
preres contemporary theories of ancient visual culture that encourage
us to see cave inscriptions not as "art," but as a type of ritualized
behavior, a set of gestures accompanying trance.
<p>
Originally published as <i>La Peinture pr&#x000E9;historique. Lascaux,
ou la naissance de l'art,</i> Bataille's book opens with a flurry of
introductory materials that frame the account of Paleolithic culture
he will provide. First, an anonymous blurb on the jacket provides
the major facts concerning the Lascaux cave: where it is located (in
P&#x000E9;rigord); how old it is (between fifteen and twenty thousand years
old); and when it was found and by whom (in 1940 by four adolescent boys).
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
After a title page there appears a short text by the editor of the
series, Albert Skira, who informs the reader that the volume contains
the first photographic record in color of the caves. Skira sounds a
note that will be

<br /><br />
echoed later in Bataille's text: the necessity of seeing the images
in person. The experience of visiting the caves is one that cannot
be replaced, Skira notes, even by the highest quality photographic
reproductions. "What the eye sees is not necessarily what the camera
registers," Skira laments. "Time and time again we thought that our
work was finished. However, as soon as the photographs were developed,
we decided to take new shots! . . . It has to be said: the paintings at
Lascaux are moving [<i>mouvantes:</i> unstable, undulating]" (<i>L,</i>
421).
<p>
According to Skira, then, even the best photographs of the Lascaux cave
fail to capture the "moving" quality of its images. Skira's choice of
the word <i>mouvantes</i> is appropriate, for throughout Bataille's text,
the word will reappear both in the nominative form (<i>mouvement</i>) and
the adjectival form (<i>mouvement&#x000E9;</i>). Skira's (and Bataille's)
use of the adjective <i>mouvantes</i> suggests not so much that the images
"move" the viewer in the rative sense (the appropriate French word
for indicating that the images elicit an emotional response would be
<i>&#x000E9;mouvantes</i>). Rather, <i>mouvantes</i> implies that the
images themselves are moving; they are subject, as Bataille tells us
later, to a "vaste mouvement" (<i>L,</i> 51). And this effect of mobility,
of instability, is due in large part to the relation of the images to
their support, that is, to the sloping, dome-like, but uneven surfaces
of the cave. Skira wants to impress upon the reader that the full effect
of the images depends upon them being seen <i>sur place.</i> In this
way, even before Bataille begins, the cave images have been sharply
differentiated from paintings executed on an easel, not only because
paintings can be more faithfully reproduced by photography, but also
because the peculiar nature of the cave images undermines the possibility
of a comprehensive gaze, one that could master all elements of depiction
and stabilize them securely within a perspectival grid. Looking at Lascaux
produces a kind of vertigo, Skira is suggesting, and this vertigo is part
of the viewing experience itself. "The images do not present themselves
as flat surfaces which one could see perfectly by positioning oneself
before them, two or three meters away," Skira explains to his readers;
"The artists of the grotto have made prodigious use of the relief and
the roughness of the walls, as well as the perspective of the halls. . . at each step, everything changes . . . What is the ideal point of
view? Each visitor must have his own, and the men of Lascaux had theirs,
which we have tried to comprehend" (<i>L,</i> 421). Despite the efforts
of his team, Skira concludes, the images will suffer from being reduced
to photographic reproductions. They might retain their perfection as
forms, but they necessarily lose their sense of movement and constant
vacillation before the eye.
<p>
Whereas Skira begins by emphasizing the specificity of the Lascaux images,
Bataille, curiously, opens his own account by attempting to assimilate
the cave's depictions into the "history of art and more generally. . . into the history of humanity" (<i>L,</i> 9). Bataille clearly
feels the need to establish a continuity between what he calls "l'homme
de Lascaux" (Lascaux man) and the modern viewer, and thus between the
cave images&#x02014;as strange as they might at first appear&#x02014;and Art
(with a capital A) as it is conceived within the European tradition.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
It is for this reason that Bataille breaks the mold of paleographic
scholarship and starts not by providing a detailed description of the
cave (as do Henri Breuil and Fernand Windels, two of the most prestigious
prehistorians of


<b></b>


his period), but instead by summarizing the works of "les
sp&#x000E9;cialistes" that identify the emergence of artistic behavior
with the birth of the human species itself.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Lascaux "communicates" with the modern viewer, Bataille claims, because
it transmits a "message" in a visual language we, as members of the same
species as Lascaux man, can understand (<i>L,</i> 12). In an effort to
establish the continuity of this visual language, Bataille considers
carefully the extant scholarship on prehistoric image-making before
turning in the latter chapters to his own viewing experience of the
caves. In the course of <i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille introduces forensic
evidence provided by paleontologists and physical anthropologists (Daniel
Peyrony, William Howells); he weighs the merit of competing theories
advanced by ethnographers and historians of religion (Saloman Reinach,
Kurt Lindner, Evelyne Lot-Falck); and he ponders the explanations
of image-making offered by various psychologists and philosophers
(Georges-Henri Luquet, Johan Huizinga). Ultimately, however, the approach
Bataille forges is guided by a profound perceptual experience of the
caves, one which is without doubt mediated by preconditioned responses
but nonetheless capable of providing him access to a variety of insight
that lends <i>Lascaux</i> its proleptic quality.
<p>
Although Bataille develops his own individual approach to Lascaux, his
account can by no means be considered immune to the kinds of prejudices
and fallacious assumptions that circulated in the archaeological
and ethnographic sources he employs. For the sake of his argument,
Bataille makes use of a broad spectrum of scholarship, much of which
would be considered by today's professionals in the field to be outdated
empirically and of dubious value heuristically. The very title of the
Lascaux book echoes one of the period's major (but false) preconceptions
that, as Breuil puts it in his famous <i>Quatre cents si&#x000E8;cles
d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i> (Four Hundred Centuries of Cave Art), the
paintings and engravings in the caves of the Pyrenees constitute the
"Origin of Art."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Bataille needs the emergence of modern man to coincide with the
birth of art not only in order to explain the power of Paleolithic
imagery to communicate across millennia, but also, and perhaps even
more importantly, to support his major thesis: that image-making is a
form of transgression, a sign, therefore, of the presence of the very
prohibitions that make humans human. Relying heavily on the authority
of the physical anthropologists, Bataille sets forth his argument
that "l'homme de Lascaux" represents "the achievement of the species"
(<i>L,</i> 20): "The name of Lascaux is the symbol of the period that
witnessed the passage from the human beast [<i>la b&#x000EA;te humaine</i>]
to the subtle beings [<i>l'&#x000EA;tre d&#x000E9;li&#x000E9;</i>] that we
are" (<i>L,</i> 22).
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
There is thus no doubt that Bataille's text is marred&#x02014;and
limited&#x02014;by the Eurocentrism and primitivism of the humanist
project. But while Bataille employs the mid-century archaeological
narrative of human evolution (as well as the ethnographer's account of the
"contemporary savage") in order to establish the birth date of something
he can call "art," he nonetheless refuses to accord credibility to the
account of art's <i>meaning</i> that the social scientists of the time
were advancing. Prehistorians during Bataille's period were limited
by the paucity of their tools (and of the evidence) to imagining
scenarios in which the depictions might have been produced. Many of
these scenarios were based not on the specific contents of the imagery
(which differed from


<b></b>


site to site), but on broad hypotheses derived from the study of
indigenous peoples still living in tribal conditions. It is important
to recall that Bataille wrote <i>Lascaux</i> approximately ten years
before Andr&#x000E9; Leroi-Gourhan began publishing his ground-breaking
structuralist studies of cave imagery, studies that would usher in a
dramatically different manner of interpreting the visual culture of the
Paleolithic by focusing on the internal relations among images rather
than on their hypothesized cultic or ritual functions.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Habits of viewing that would be developed by the structuralists of
the 1960s were, during the early part of the century, in an embryonic
state; in contrast, theories of the image's social and religious
functions had reached a high degree of elaboration. In order to
establish these functions&#x02014;since they could not be read in the
imagery itself&#x02014;prehistorians before Leroi-Gourhan had to borrow
heavily from comparative ethnography, a field that blossomed at the
turn of the century with the advent of Emile Durkheim's <i>Les Formes
&#x000E9;l&#x000E9;mentaires de la vie religieuse</i> , based on
the massive synthesizing studies of James Frazer, Edward Burnett Taylor,
and John Lubbock.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Evidence drawn from the observation of Native Americans and New
Zealanders, Australian Aruntas and African Bushmen was mobilized to
account for the location and content of cave imagery executed hundreds of
thousands of years earlier. The explanatory model that would have been
most influential upon Bataille when he visited the cave of Lascaux in
1952 was therefore one that insisted upon the necessity of understanding
the motivations of Paleolithic image-makers through the lens provided
by ethnographic research on indigenous groups referred to at the time as
"contemporary savages."
<p>
Until the discovery of Lascaux, research on Paleolithic image-making was
still very much under the sway of an ethnographic doctrine that emphasized
the utilitarian function of representation, its imbrication in rituals of
sympathetic magic. Basing their conclusions on the findings of research
conducted in areas remote to Europe, prehistorians such as Reinach,
Count Henri B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n, and, in their wake, Breuil, argued that
Paleolithic image-makers also engaged in aesthetic behaviors primarily
(if not exclusively) because they believed mimetic representation could
ensure the abundance and capture of animal prey. The impulse toward
image-making and mark-making in general was thought to be secondary to a
biological imperative; examining prehistoric images as works of art in
their own right would therefore have been considered to be misguided,
privileging an aspect of mark-making that "primitives" themselves
considered negligible. As Reinach, the comparative ethnographer and
historian of religion, wrote in his immensely influential "L'Art et
la magie" of 1903, for those living in hunter-gatherer societies,
"producing images was about assuring, by means of magic practices,
the multiplication of game, upon which depended the existence of the
clan or the tribe . . . the image of a being or of an object lent power
over this object or being; the author or possessor of an image could
<i>influence</i> the thing represented."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
The only conclusion that could be drawn concerning images found in
such caves as Altamira, it seemed to Reinach, was the conclusion he
had drawn about cave images produced by aboriginals in Australia:
they had been executed not in order to please, but in order to "evoke"
(<i>&#x000E9;voquer</i>) or conjure forth during a ritual of "hunting
magic": "Calling such


<b></b>


images works of art, in the modern sense of the term, is an anachronism;
the prehistoric sculptor was not trying to please<i>,</i> but to
conjure . . . the great flourishing of art during the Reindeer Age
[<i>l'&#x000C2;ge du renne</i>] is linked to the development of magic,
such as it is practiced in tribal societies of hunters and fishermen
today" ("AM," 135-6). Or, as B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n would put it, "once
man recognized the evocative and creative powers [of the image], magic
became the support, the essential foundation of art."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
It began to emerge during the next generation, however, that forensic
evidence (animal bones found in hearths) flatly contradicted Reinach's
theory: the species of animals depicted on the caves were not those that
the Aurignacians most frequently consumed. As early as 1931, Luquet noted
the presence of animals and scenes that had nothing to do with the hunt,
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
and a few years later, Max Rapha&#x000EB;l insisted that the depictions of
noncomestible animals were so numerous that an alternative explanation,
based on the singular attributes and contents of each individual site,
must be sought.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
In short, if it could be proven that aboriginals in Australia were
practicing sympathetic magic to attract prey, such a claim could not
be sustained in the context of prehistoric man. But this was only one
of the problems presented by a hasty recourse to ethnographic research
conducted in spatially and temporally alien fields. A greater problem
with the comparatist approach, critics would soon argue, is that it
drew attention away from the actual marks on the wall, discouraging
analysis of their individual properties and environmental contexts in
favor of large overarching theories of social function based on groups
that had no direct relation to hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian
times or Cantabrian spaces. However, since, as Reinach himself noted,
there were no equally persuasive models available during the 1930s,
the comparatist account remained dominant (and still, despite the
intervention of structuralism, holds a strong grip on the field today).
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Additional support came from developments in French ethnography, which
was flourishing during the third decade of the twentieth century.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Predictably, then, the German ethnographer, Kurt Lindner, found an
eager French audience when he published his comparative ethnographic
study, <i>Die Jagd der Vorzeit,</i> in 1937 (translated as <i>La Chasse
pr&#x000E9;historique</i> [The prehistoric hunt] in 1941). In effect,
Lindner's work propelled the next wave of comparative ethnography
and helped shape the approach against which Bataille would argue in
<i>Lascaux</i>. Lindner followed in the footsteps of historians of
religion such as Reinach, arguing in even more forceful terms that
cave imagery was fundamentally instrumental in nature, dictated by the
exigencies of magic rituals that corresponded to the belief systems of
hunter-gatherer tribes. A true comparatist, Lindner based his theory
on the hunting practices of living Caribou Eskimos, insisting that, for
both contemporary and prehistoric "savages," a belief in the depiction's
power to be magically "possessed" by the spirit of the animal preceded
any interest in the depiction's aesthetic value.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
For Lindner, aesthetic considerations would have been almost entirely
absent in the production of images forged primarily to ensure the
survival of the tribe.
<p>
When Bataille moved from the Coll&#x000E8;ge de Sociologie to
archaeological sites in the Dordogne, this is the background of
scholarship he inherited. Given his audacious attempts in the 1930s to
rethink art through culture, it is significant that Bataille was


<b></b>


not more willing to absorb the ethnographic teachings of Reinach and
Lindner.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Their attempt to view the cave images within larger (albeit invented)
cultural contexts could conceivably have appealed to Bataille's own
concerns. Yet clearly, in <i>Lascaux</i> Bataille's greatest energy
is spent refuting the comparatist contention that in Paleolithic
image-making aesthetic considerations were subordinate to utilitarian
ones. Repellent to Bataille is the implication that art, at its
origin, is linked primarily to the <i>practical</i> economies of
survival, that it is in profound harmony, rather than provocative
tension, with the instrumental and profane world of labor. As
opposed to the ethnographers, Bataille strives in <i>Lascaux</i>
to remove representation from the category of survival economies and
culturally consolidating prohibitions in order to place it squarely
in the domain of expenditure and transgression. Bataille's strategy
is to resurrect and emphasize the aesthetic qualities of the Lascaux
cave images as these qualities strike the modern viewer. He does so,
on the one hand, by depending upon the work of two modern viewers,
Breuil and Windels, and, on the other, by trusting his own considerable
talents as an observer of the images themselves. If Bataille insists
in <i>Lascaux</i> upon the modernity of the cave's images, on their
ability to communicate their "message" over hundreds of thousands of
centuries <i>to us,</i> it is in order to disentangle this imagery
from its immediate function, from the uses to which, according to
ethnographers, it had been put (and by which its effects would logically
have been limited). Responding directly to Lindner's contention that
the entire value of image-making for prehistoric peoples resided in
the notion, attributed to sympathetic magic, that by making an image
of an animal one could control it, Bataille writes in <i>Lascaux</i>
that no "particular practical intention" can explain the existence of
art (<i>L,</i> 42). "Doubtless, we must acknowledge the existence of
a specific, practical intention [<i>une intention &#x000E9;troitement
mat&#x000E9;rielle</i>]," Bataille concedes; "In the minds of the men
of Lascaux, magic must have played a role similar to that which it
plays in peoples studied by ancient history and ethnography. It is
nevertheless worth protesting against the tendency to attribute too much
meaning to this desire for immediate effect [<i>cette volont&#x000E9;
d'action efficace</i>]," he qualifies. Admitting that a mark might be
made in order to serve a particular, localized purpose, Bataille goes
on to stress that "in every ritual operation the attempt to produce a
certain result, to fulfill a certain purpose, is only one among many
of the intentions of those involved: these intentions embrace reality
in its entirety&#x02014;religious reality, the reality of the senses,
aesthetic reality." For Bataille, the ultimate goal of image-making
is "the creation of a sensuous reality [<i>une r&#x000E9;alit&#x000E9;
sensible</i>] which modifies the world, responding to our desire
for something miraculous, extra-worldly [<i>une r&#x000E9;ponse au
d&#x000E9;sir de prodige</i>], implied in the very essence of what it
is to be human" (<i>L,</i> 37).
<p>
In this passage, Bataille rejects with some vehemence the utilitarian
model of image-making and proffers instead his own aesthetic theory or
rationale for Paleolithic representation. The "efficacy" model does not
account for a central objective of image-making, states Bataille, which
is to "modify the world" in such a way that it respond to our "desire for
the miraculous." It is unclear whether Bataille means that this desire,
essential to our humanity, is something that differentiates us from the
animals or, alternatively, brings us closer to them. It would seem that
it is both at once, for the


<b></b>


aesthetic impulse is the very sign that we want to recapture something
we, as humans who make the world into a world of things, have lost: the
<i>animal</i> sense of the world as not yet divided between subjective
consciousness and reified object, a world, in other words, that remains
profoundly sensual, penetrated by and penetrating our existence as
unbounded beings. As Bataille writes further on, the objectification
of the world made possible by man's naming of things "tears" man away
from an immediate sensual experience of them (<i>la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate</i>); but through art man can regain this sensual
immediacy and rediscover, on a visceral level, his continuity with
the world around him: "Man rediscovers sensation [<i>le sensible</i>]
if, by means of his labor, he creates, over and beyond useful works
[<i>des oeuvres utiles</i>], a work of art [<i>une oeuvre d'art</i>]"
(<i>L,</i> 30).
<p>
By associating the cave images with the retrieval of a sensual (animal,
immediate) relation to the world, Bataille manages to attack historians
of religion such as Reinach and Lindner on two fronts. First, his
emphasis on the sensual as opposed to the functional qualities of
the images themselves (the way in which they address needs that are
more than biological in nature) reverses the hierarchy established
by the prehistorians; Bataille subordinates utilitarian concerns
to aesthetic&#x02014;or <i>aisthetic</i>&#x02014;ones, and makes magic
(and belief systems in general) secondary to the ecstasy of creative
praxis, the unprofitable expenditure of energy. This is Bataille's way
of accounting for "the beauty that fascinates the visitor to Lascaux"
(<i>L,</i> 15): the fact that we still resonate to the images is proof,
for Bataille, that their (ritual) function does not exhaust their
communicative force.
<p>
Second, Bataille's approach to cave images contradicts the comparatist's
urge to forge analogies between Paleolithic man and other tribal peoples
living in distinct climes and temporalities. By insisting that cave images
are "oeuvres d'art," Bataille distances them further from ethnographic
scenarios and draws them into closer relation with what he considers to
be the most sophisticated artworks of European civilization. However,
Bataille's move to extricate the cave images from utilitarian scenarios
is facilitated by the evidence of Lascaux itself, which struck all who
saw it as containing forms of pictorial expression far in advance of any
that had been seen before. Reinach and Lindner were writing, after all,
before the discovery of Lascaux in 1940; had they confronted Lascaux's
more "polished" depictions, its scenes of rushing herds and grazing
couples that resemble in their <i>facture</i> and handling the iconic
traditions of Western illusionism, they might have found the comparative
gesture less convincing. On the other hand, Bataille pays a certain price
for refusing the comparatist gesture, for displacing the ethnographic
frame in favor of an implicitly acontextual, art-for-art's-sake kind of
approach. In his attempt to wrestle the images of Lascaux out of the
hands of "les sp&#x000E9;cialistes," MM. Reinach and Lindner, Bataille
ends up relating image-making itself, at its very origins, to "the
highest aspirations" of man:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
These are works of art [<i>oeuvres d'art</i>] like any other, and
they are no less beautiful [<i>belles</i>] than any other. . . . all
civilizations have had the same fundamental reason for constructing them
[<i>la m&#x000EA;me raison profonde de les &#x000E9;difier</i>], the basic
desire common to all men, of


<b></b>


whatever period or region, to be amazed
[<i>&#x000E9;merveill&#x000E9;</i>]. If we seize this aspect of things,
we can say without pause that, despite his extreme poverty, Lascaux
man was animated by the highest aspirations [<i>des aspirations les
plus&#x000E9;lev&#x000E9;es</i>].
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"Belles," "&#x000E9;difier," "&#x000E9;lev&#x000E9;es"&#x02014;these terms
cannot but startle a reader familiar with Bataille's earlier essays on,
for instance, the "informe." Here, Bataille is practically forced by
the momentum of his argument to identify Lascaux with his b&#x000EA;te
noire, "Architecture," that monumental form of human productivity that
represents for him&#x02014;at least in 1929&#x02014;everything elevated
and orderly. Indeed, the portrait he gives us in <i>Lascaux</i> of the
"oeuvre d'art" as motivated by "the highest aspirations" seems the very
opposite of a practice of mark-making dedicated to retrieving the sensual
ambiguities and transgressive possibilities of "la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
It is not surprising that readers enamored of Bataille's earlier writings
on art would be somewhat chagrined by this turn of events. But it is
worth pausing for a moment to ask how and why Bataille arrives at such
a curious point, for in reality he is navigating a precarious passage
through opposing but equally treacherous systems of explanation, each
of which exerted considerable force on the commissioned writer at the
time. Since these systems and their discursive conventions might not be
immediately available to readers unfamiliar with the history of research
on Paleolithic visual culture, I will briefly attempt to chart them here.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"<i>cet enchev&#x000EA;trement d'innombrables graffites . . ."</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
During the period prior to the discovery of Lascaux, and thus before
Bataille even began contemplating the Lascaux project, the discipline of
prehistory had been undergoing a rather dramatic transformation. While
still following the trail indicated by Reinach, paleographers were
increasingly applying methodologies to the study of cave images derived
not from the discipline of comparative ethnography but rather from
those of art history and archaeology. Even the terms for designating
the object of study had changed. For instance, after the authenticity
of the Altamira cave paintings was confirmed by &#x000C9;mile Cartailhac
in his famous "mea culpa" of 1902, images that had originally entered
the discourse of the social sciences under the heading <i>graffites</i>
suddenly came under the purview of art history as well as paleontology and
began appearing under a new guise&#x02014;as <i>dessins,</i> for instance,
and then as <i>peintures,gravures,</i> and, finally, <i>oeuvres d'art</i>.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
To be sure, accounts such as Reinach's still played a dominant role
in studies devoted to cave depictions; however, the sheer quantity
and variety of examples that were unearthed between the end of the
nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth produced
important alterations of the "art as functional" thesis.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Two voices were particularly resonant during the early twentieth century,
those of Breuil and Luquet, both of whom were well known to Bataille
by the time he offered Skira his book on <i>Lascaux</i>. As might be
predicted, these authors would have a profound influence on the way
in which Bataille approaches the question of why prehistoric man made
images in the caves.


<b></b>


<p>
Breuil's intervention in the domain of prehistory has had perhaps the
longest-lasting impact on the development of the disciplines concerned
with the Paleolithic. An ordained priest as well as a professor of
prehistoric ethnography at the Institut de Pal&#x000E9;ontologie Humaine
de Paris, Breuil studied Paleolithic cultural production in China, South
Africa, and Europe. He was present at the discovery of several major caves
in the Dordogne (Les Combarelles I and Font-de-Gaume [1901]), helped
excavate La Mouthe  and Trois-Fr&#x000E8;res , and, having
gained wide renown by 1940, was the first professional archaeologist
invited to visit Lascaux&#x02014;nine days after it was brought to light.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Breuil never entirely abandoned the comparatist approach, and therefore
always assumed a continuity between the practices of contemporary
cave painters in Australia, his favored analogue, and those of
hunter-gatherers inhabiting the Dordogne hundreds of thousands of
years before.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
However, he offered the field a new orientation when he introduced a
strict system of classification that focused attention on aspects of
the images earlier ethnographers had ignored. Noticing incompatibilities
in execution among different types of images sharing the same support,
and conjecturing that these incompatibilities resulted from the use of
tools and techniques that varied over the course of history, Breuil
developed a chronology that separated the cave images into discrete
epochs or phases and emphasized the progressive refinement of depictive
techniques over time. According to Breuil, not only did the cave walls
provide a palimpsest of technically distinct depictions, but these
technical distinctions remained constant within a certain period. In
short, it could be said that each age possessed its own "style": "it
suffices to observe with care this constant order," suggested Breuil
as early as 1906, "to establish at once the relative chronology of the
diverse artistic phases that succeeded one another during the entire
duration of the Reindeer Age."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
In a sense, Breuil's "relative chronology" was responsible for ushering
"prehistory" into the domain of history <i>tout court</i>. Breuil
gave temporal thickness to prehistoric time. Further, his notion of
"diverse artistic phases" or successive "styles" allowed "prehistoric"
cave imagery to be assimilated into the same epistemology of chronological
classification that dominated art historical approaches of the period.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Breuil buttressed his tacit identification of Paleolithic epochs with
modern epochs by applying to the description of Paleolithic imagery a
descriptive vocabulary and a cyclical model of rise and decline drawn
from art historical discourse. (For instance, the "Upper Paleolithic"
was, for Breuil, the apex of cave image-making just as the High
Renaissance art of Leonardo and Michelangelo was, for Vasari, the
culmination of the Western tradition.) This cross-fertilization of the
two disciplines, comparative ethnography and art history, resulted in
the hybrid discourse we find in Breuil's and Capitan's studies of Les
Combarelles, for instance.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The ethnographic research of the same period did not remain
impregnable to the intrusion of these new discursive conventions and
classificatory epistemologies: as opposed to Reinach, who was writing
much earlier and thus had not read Breuil, Lindner, in <i>Die Jagd
der Vorzeit</i> of 1937, not only reiterates&#x02014;and thus tacitly
corroborates&#x02014;Breuil's chronological schema, but also insists upon
speaking of "oeuvres," "&#x000E9;coles," the "m&#x000E9;tier," and discrete
"styles" of Paleolithic image-making,


<b></b>


even while characterizing the producers of these "oeuvres" as
pelt-wearing, spear-launching sorcerer-magicians interested above all
in the capture of game.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, for prehistorians of Breuil's generation, the marks on cave
walls suddenly become chronotopic indexes of the discrete practices of
individuals, and not simply traces of homogeneous and unchanging cultural
rituals. Superimposed Paleolithic images, that is, lines crisscrossing or
res transgressing one another's boundaries (<i>empi&#x000E8;tement</i>)
within the same space (or upon the same picture plane), were understood
by the second wave of prehistorians to have been produced not only
successively but at widely disparate moments in history, although in
reality they had few tools for determining accurately which mark preceded
which. As the historian Marc Groenen has noted, Breuil merely shifted
onto a reading of the cave wall itself the archaeologist's stratigraphic
analysis of the cave <i>floor</i>, a type of analysis in which each layer
of earth (and therefore its contents: bones, pottery shards, and so on)
is taken to represent a different geological era. By focusing on the
superimposition of marks rather than the superimposition of soil layers,
Breuil had introduced a conceptual displacement, not a new forensic
technology. In Groenen's words, Breuil advanced "the prior acceptance of
a methodologically risky premise, namely, that <i>each recorded trace
materializes a distinct artistic phase of the Paleolithic Era</i>. To
establish his chronology, however, Breuil has to breathe a temporal
thickness [<i>insuffler une &#x000E9;paisseur temporelle</i>] between
each of the traces that compose the res. In reality, this temporal
thickness has no material substance [<i>n'est mat&#x000E9;rialis&#x000E9;e
par rien</i>]" ("PHP," 326; italics in original).
<p>
With the erection of Breuil's classifying system, the Paleolithic
artist was definitively ushered into the art historical pantheon. For
Breuil and his followers, the cave painter was first and foremost an
artist, not a libidinal child trailing his fingers across a cave wall
(<i>pace</i> Luquet), or a sorcerer engaged in a cultural practice
deriving its primary meaning from totemism or a ritual of sympathetic
magic (<i>pace</i> Reinach, Lindner, and B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n). However, if
Breuil successfully wrested cave imagery out of the fists of ethnographers
and historians of religion, thereby making it available to modernist
aesthetics and "imaginary museums," he simultaneously obscured the
specific cultural context of image-making, its imbrication in a set of
cultural practices that differed according to site, climate, community,
and so on.
<p>
Breuil's attempt to account for the superimposition of images
with recourse to an "&#x000E9;paisseur temporelle" may indeed have
lacked forensic or material support. Yet it spoke nonetheless to a
phenomenon that clearly demanded further consideration and study. With
the discovery of Gargas in 1906 and Trois Fr&#x000E8;res in 1916
(. <a href="#4">4</a> and <a href="#5">5</a>), it had
become evident to scholars of prehistory such as Breuil that something
unusual, something utterly foreign to contemporary artistic practices,
was at work in Paleolithic image-making. The fact that Paleolithic
image-makers superimposed one set of marks on another did not conform to
the simple widespread understanding of representation as governed by the
intention to imitate a preexisting re with a durable mark. Breuil's
chronology represented an effort to deal with the strangeness
of a phenomenon French prehistorians referred to in bewilderment as
<i>superposition,empi&#x000E8;tement,enchev&#x000EA;trement,entrecroisement,palimpseste,</i>
or simply <i>fouillimini</i>. The phenomenon

of superimposition that so intrigued the first observers of caves such as
Trois Fr&#x000E8;res and Lascaux could be neatly explained by recourse to
Breuil's narrative of temporal succession; different artists returned at
different points in history to redraw&#x02014;and, in Breuil's narrative,
to perfect&#x02014;the same limited vocabulary of res, sometimes
accidentally


<b></b>


covering over a portion of a previous rendering and thus creating
the impression of carelessness or lack of respect for what had come
before. But as convincing as Breuil's account might at first have
appeared, it was clear that it left many questions unresolved. In one of
his earliest attempts to describe the cave, entitled simply "Lascaux"
and published in <i>L'Anthropologie</i> in 1950 (an essay which left
a great impression on Bataille), Breuil is so stunned by the "tangle of
innumerable graffiti of deer, horse, and bison [<i>un enchev&#x000EA;trement
d'innombrables graffites de cerfs, chevaux, bisons</i>]" that he neglects
to apply his trusty chronological grid.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Although Breuil remembers to insist that "All that could not have
been the work of a single day or even a short period: generations of
artists worked there" ("L," 361), he tacitly admits a kind of exegetical
impotence when faced with the sheer quantity of interlocking, overlapping
res:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As one advances further, the state of the artworks improves,
although the painting still remains, in comparison with the first
hall, markedly weaker, even scarcely visible [<i>&#x000E0; peine
visible</i>]. Several layers are superimposed [<i>il y en a plusieurs
couches en superposition</i>]; the most recent are the best conserved,
the oldest are reduced to a tenuous shadow. This is true for the Great
Nave and the lower regions of the Great Dome where, <i>in infinite
number</i> [<i>en nombre infini</i>] hundreds and hundreds of engraved
res crisscross and recross&#x02014;immense brown steer, <i>visible
only from a distance and almost effaced</i>, or innumerable graffiti,
large and small, that benefit from the somber colors of the larger
beasts by exhibiting their incised white traces against the dark
background they provide. Generations and generations had to pass in
order to produce this accumulated <i>tangle of innumerable graffiti</i>
[<i>cet enchev&#x000EA;trement d'innombrables graffites</i>]&#x02014;of
deer, horse, bison&#x02014;amidst which I found a sole reindeer . . . While
contemplating this fading grandeur one experiences a feeling of amazement,
but also a certain sadness at finding such vestiges <i>at the very limit
of the visible</i> [<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible</i>]. ["L," 360;
emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Breuil alludes three times within one paragraph to the unquantifiable
plethora of res, "en nombre infini," "graffites, innombrables,"
"innombrables graffites." It is as though he were suddenly faced with
an incarnation of the mathematical sublime&#x02014;not up in the sky,
but beneath the earth, a cosmos turned inward or upside-down. There are
simply too many res, and they overlap with one another to such a great
degree, that the human eye is incapable of assimilating them. They are
"&#x000E0; la limite du visible," or "&#x000E0; peine visible." Breuil, of
course, is not entirely bereft of tools; in "Lascaux" he already produces
a rational explanation for the layering, or "superposition," of images as
the attempt on the part of later artists to "restore" the work of their
predecessors; "The Paleolithic artists thus restored certain parts of
the contours of animals painted before," he writes ("L," 360). What he
will term in <i>Quatre cent si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i> a
"veritable spider's web of graffiti of all dimensions" (<i>QCS,</i> 131)
may be due, he conjectures, to retouching. And yet this conjecture fails
to satisfy him. In the article for <i>L'Anthropologie,</i> Breuil simply
cannot encompass within scientific discourse the visual experience he
registers. The very hypervisibility of the res renders them barely
visible, "<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible.</i>" Their alarming number
and diversity, the intensity of their entanglement, overwhelms Breuil's
narrative of viewing, and the exegetical force of the prehistorian's
temporal grid gives way beneath the weight of a kind of

a descriptive supplement, an overflow of superlative constructions that
reflect the observer's "wonder" and awe.
<p>
There is no doubt that Bataille was affected by this passage, which
does not, it is worth noting, appear in the same form two years later
in <i>Quatre cent si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i>.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
In a little red notebook marked "novembre 1953," which preserves
a record of the documents Bataille consulted while preparing
<i>Lascaux,</i> we find a telling allusion to Breuil's article. Beside
the reference&#x02014;"Breuil. Lascaux B.S.P.F. [acronym for <i>Bulletin
de la Soci&#x000E9;t&#x000E9; Pr&#x000E9;historique Fran&#x000E7;aise</i>]
t. 47 1950 no. 6-8"&#x02014;Bataille jots down the words "tr&#x000E8;s
important"&#x02014;a qualification which does not accompany any of the
other citations recorded in the notebook.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
As might be expected, elements of Breuil's account reappear in
Bataille's own description of the cave, especially, as we shall see,
in his description of the "Hall of the Bulls." Although Bataille is
clearly indebted to Breuil's more thorough account in <i>Quatre cent
si&#x000E8;cles d'art pari&#x000E9;tal</i>, as well as that found in
Windels's <i>Lascaux, "Chapelle Sixtine" de la pr&#x000E9;histoire,</i>
it is Breuil's evocation of his own "&#x000E9;merveillement" before
the images, an "&#x000E9;merveillement" that registers the very limits
of visibility, that colors Bataille's own approach. "Marvel for the
eyes," Bataille writes in terms that recall Breuil (<i>L,</i> 43);
"At Lascaux, in the depths of the earth, what leads us astray, what
transres us, is the vision of the furthest distance [<i>la vision du
plus lointain</i>]. This message is, moreover, intensified by an inhuman
strangeness [<i>une &#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9; inhumaine</i>]. We see a
kind of round, an animal cavalcade, pursuing itself across the walls"
(<i>L,</i> 12). Breuil's "&#x000E9;merveillement" returns here as the
experience of being led outside of the self (<i>ce qui . . . nous
&#x000E9;gare</i>) or transred (<i>et nous transre</i>) by a
vision that transports us back to the most distant time, a vision,
one might say, of excessive distance itself (<i>la visiondu plus
lointain</i>), which fills us with amazement (<i>&#x000E9;tonnement</i>)
and admiration (<i>L,</i> 9). Without evoking the experience of blindness
(associated with gazing at "une &#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9; inhumaine"
in early essays such as "Soleil pourri"), Bataille nevertheless
accentuates the force of Lascaux as a visual spectacle, one that, at
least momentarily, overwhelms the archaeologist's interpretive grid. What
is communicated across the millennia&#x02014;for Bataille and for the
Breuil of "Lascaux"&#x02014;is less a composed scene than a confusing
palimpsest; the modern viewer sees <i>too much</i>&#x02014;too many lines,
too many forms&#x02014;and the eye reaches its own limit as an agent of
discernment (<i>&#x000E0; la limite du visible</i>) in an experience of
ecstatic visual satiation, or optical transgression, entirely familiar
to readers of <i>Histoire de l'oeil</i> or <i>L'Exp&#x000E9;rience
int&#x000E9;rieure</i>.
<p>
As Bataille proceeds to describe the cave in detail, however, he
will not remain in the role of ecstatic observer, but instead don the
hat of the scholar involved in sifting and classifying data. Moving
back and forth between the two roles assigned to him as author of a
commissioned volume, Bataille at one moment synthesizes the findings
of the "sp&#x000E9;cialistes" and then, at another, reconstructs these
findings with reference to his own optical impressions. The expressions
"give the impression" (<i>donnent l'impression</i>) and "to my eyes"
(<i>&#x000E0; mes yeux</i>) return insistently throughout the section
entitled "Description of the Grotto," indicating that Bataille is just as
concerned with recording what he construes to be an immediate response
to the spectacle as he is with accommodating the reader's demand for
scholarly synthesis. The following entry in


<b></b>


Bataille's little red notebook gives a sense of how Bataille was
negotiating between two exigencies: his desire to capture an initial,
spontaneous reaction to the cave images and his need to assimilate
these images into the systems of classification and forensic accounts
of production generated by the empirical research of archaeologists.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Immediately succeeding the reference to the Breuil citation (and
the words "tr&#x000E8;s important") we find a series of notes that
begin with the theme of visibility, then turn to the subject of
<i>facture</i>. The latter part of the entry is clearly indebted not
to Breuil's "Lascaux"&#x02014;which is fairly sketchy where forensic
evidence is concerned&#x02014;but to the much more polished account of
Lascaux offered by Windels in his <i>Lascaux, "Chapelle Sixtine" de
la pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>. (In the quotation below, I have tried to
imitate Bataille's own spacing.)

</blockquote>

<p>
The first two lines could easily have been drawn directly from
Breuil's "Lascaux": the word "superposition" comes from the paragraph
reproduced above in which Breuil states that "[s]everal layers are
superimposed" and the expression "&#x000E0; perspective tordue" (distorted
perspective) appears in the very next paragraph ("L," 360). The re
"n&#x000E9;gligences de l'oeil" (carelessnesses of the eye) however,
does not appear in the Breuil text (nor in Windels's for that matter),
but seems nonetheless to correspond to the theme of visual confusion
that must have attracted Bataille's attention. Most interesting is
Bataille's insertion of the words "rien &#x000E0; voir" (nothing to
see) as if in the margins of his own notes, and then his subsequent
deletion, or crossing-out, of the word "rien." One is tempted to read
the crossing-out of "rien" as a case of what Bataille might have called
"contagion"; Bataille's own superimposition&#x02014;in which one mark
crosses over another mark&#x02014;appears to be a symptomatic repetition
of the very phenomenon he is describing.
<p>
Be that as it may, Bataille quickly turns away from a meditation on
what there is&#x02014;and isn't&#x02014;to see and begins a new set of
notes clearly taken from Windels's <i>Lascaux, la "Chapelle Sixtine"
de la pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>, a text which determines to a large extent
Bataille's


<b></b>


treatment of the "Hall of the Bulls" in <i>Lascaux</i>. The sequence
"oxyde min&#x000E9;raux" (mineral oxides), "d&#x000E9;layage dans l'eau
l'urine la graisse" (thinning in water urine grease) and so on, is lifted
with little modification from the section of Windel's book entitled
"Technique et Facture."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Elements of Windels's rendering are laced through his prose, although
he reserves his explicit discussion of technical matters for the "Notes
et Documentation" included at the very end of the volume. The reason
Windels is important to Bataille, however, is not that he supplies
details of manufacture but rather that he represents the extreme version
of an art historical perspective on Paleolithic image-making which
Bataille needs to respect if he is to vanquish the art-as-functional
approach of the comparative ethnographers. Whereas to the amazed Breuil
the cave images appear tangled (<i>enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;s</i>)
to the point of illegibility, Windels, in contrast, is assured that
even the "fouillis" (muddle) of this "extraordinary ensemble" will,
after adequate inspection, reveal a rigorous set of compositional
rules (<i>LCSP,</i> 17). Images that might be "barely recognizable"
(<i>LCSP,</i> 19) at the start will come into focus and the tangled,
superimposed res will resolve into carefully composed scenes. Such
must be the case if Lascaux is to prove comparable to the Sistine
Chapel. Thus, instead of resonating in awe to the miraculous spectacle
of "innombrables graffites," Windels celebrates the forensic tools
available for deciphering what will eventually be submitted to vision
as a set of clearly demarcated forms. The more one looks, the more
one will see. And this is true not simply because the images are each
complete in themselves, indexes of discrete (pre)historical epochs,
but also and even more importantly because these images are, contrary
to what one might think, disposed in arrangements that will prove
pleasing to the eye. They are, it turns out, by no means thrown together
"p&#x000EA;le-m&#x000EA;le" but instead "truly composed" (<i>LCSP,</i> 81).
<p>
In the pages of <i>Lascaux, la "Chapelle Sixtine" de la
pr&#x000E9;histoire</i>, Windels makes a strong claim for the cave,
insisting that its images surpass all found before insofar as they prove
prehistoric man <i>capable of composition</i>. "It has often been said
that quaternary artists were ignorant with respect to composition and
that they only knew how to depict isolated elements without thinking
about proportion or positioning," begins Windels; "the great majority of
Paleolithic works are formed of animals either superimposed one on top of
the other or scattered about in all directions with no apparent concern
for composition [<i>sans souci apparent de composition</i>]." Lascaux,
he continues, challenges previous conceptions of cave art, for here,
"several ensembles seem <i>truly composed</i>. . . . these groups testify
to the existence, in their authors, of <i>a sure and already evolved
sense of composition</i>" (<i>LCSP,</i> 81; emphasis added). Windels
might not be prepared to assert that all superimposed markings will,
under the penetrating gaze of the archaeologist, eventually resolve into
fully coherent compositions of well-defined res. But clearly his
emphasis is on finding order rather than disorder, and thus on revealing
continuities rather than discontinuities between the aesthetics of
Lascaux and the aesthetics of "modern man."
<p>
Compare Windels's account to Bataille's. As might be expected,
a continuity between "them" and "us"&#x02014;between the makers of the
"first" images and the modern viewers&#x02014;is also established, but
not on the same grounds. If we consider Bataille's


<b></b>


earliest treatment of Lascaux&#x02014;not in <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance
de l'art</i> but in his first sketch for the book, a presentation
before the Soci&#x000E9;t&#x000E9; d'Agriculture in 1952&#x02014;it is
immediately apparent where the accent is being placed. According to
Bataille, an "apparent concern for composition" (<i>un souci apparent
de composition</i>) is so little in evidence that Lascaux artists must
have been quite indifferent to the final effect: "It mattered little
to them that they effaced or obscured older images and that they ended
up with a tangled mass [<i>un enchev&#x000EA;trement</i>] <i>opposed to
any compositional principle</i> [<i>contraire &#x000E0; tout principe
de composition</i>]" (<i>L,</i> 327; emphasis added). Whereas Windels
enters the cave and clearly discerns a "sure and already evolved sense
of composition," Bataille remains skeptical. Are the superimposed images
"orderly" (<i>ordonn&#x000E9;es</i>), set into calculated arrangements,
and positioned with an eye to the ultimate achievement of a harmonious
composition? Or are the images heaped one on top of the other without
premeditation, indicating to the observer that perhaps aesthetic
preoccupations were subordinated to the act of production, to the
<i>performance</i>, or "<i>op&#x000E9;ration</i>" (as Bataille will put)
of mark-making itself?

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<i>"Ce qui est sensible &#x000E0; Lascaux, ce qui nous touche, est
ce qui bouge . . ."</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Much rides on the answer Bataille provides. If, on the one hand,
Bataille chooses to privilege his initial sense of "bewilderment"
(<i>&#x000E9;merveillement</i>), his vertigo before the apparent disorder
of the "res enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;es," he threatens to drive
a wedge between "l'homme de Lascaux" and modern man, for whom these
images remain indecipherable and strange. If, on the other, Bataille
insists upon the continuity between "l'homme de Lascaux" and modern
man, he implicitly suggests that their art manifests the same degree
of technical mastery and means-end rationality that characterizes fully
realized Western masterpieces such as the Sistine Chapel. In the latter
case, the images of Lascaux are denuded of their "&#x000E9;tranget&#x000E9;
inhumaine" as they become fully assimilated into modern conceptions
of composition, produced under the sign of the very instrumental,
work-related rationality that cave imagery is supposed to transgress. The
former case is equally disastrous, however, for if these images fail
to appear "composed," if the superimposed images really are a hopeless
"embrouillamini" (<i>L,</i> 59), they then fall back into "the animal
night" (<i>L,</i> 44) of the "primitive" and the childish. Bataille
is thus stuck in a double bind. In <i>Lascaux</i> he must locate a
compositional principle deep in the cave, for such a principle has,
in his text and in paleographic scholarship in general, become the very
index of an independent aesthetic sense. Yet, neither is it sufficient
for Bataille to announce that a compositional principle is indeed at
work, since the "&#x000E9;merveillement" Bataille seeks to convey owes
not a little to the vertigo experienced by the viewer, that is, to the
viewer's impression that the images <i>resist</i> a clear compositional
orientation. In order to resolve this dilemma, Bataille ingeniously comes
up with the oxymoronic notion of an <i>animal composition</i>, or, as
he calls it elsewhere, a "composition mouvement&#x000E9;e" (<i>L,</i> 49).
<p>
Bataille places the accent on movement throughout his detailed account
of the cave. In particular, he focuses on the ways in which movement is
captured in composed


<b></b>


groups when he describes the Hall of the Bulls, a long hallway in
which depictions of large mammal bodies are crisscrossed and entangled,
transgressing both corporeal and compositional frames. His description
begins, benignly enough, with a rehearsal of Windel's flattering
comparison between Lascaux and the Sistine Chapel:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Hall of the Bulls is about ten meters wide, thirty meters long,
but the <i>arrangement</i> [<i>la disposition</i>]<i>, the order</i>
[<i>l'ordonnance</i>]<i>, in truth disordered</i> [<i>&#x000E0; la
v&#x000E9;rit&#x000E9; d&#x000E9;sordonn&#x000E9;e</i>], of the frieze
that unwinds there gives the impression of a sort of rotunda. . . . No
other painted hall presents such a harmonious ensemble [<i>un ensemble
plus heureux</i>]. Someone once said: "Lascaux, the Sistine Chapel
of Prehistory" . . . But <i>to my eyes</i>, the Sistine Chapel, the
res of which are certainly more dramatic, nevertheless offers a
more conventional arrangement: charm, surprise, these are found at
Lascaux. [<i>L,</i> 44; emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From here, Bataille goes on to peruse the contents of the Hall&#x02014;a
long "animal frieze dominated by four gigantic bulls" and "a horde of
entangled animals" (<i>un peuple d'animaux enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;s</i>)
(<i>L,</i> 44). He then notes the dome-shaped ceiling of the cave,
which justifies Windels's comparison to Michelangelo's spherical support
(<i>L,</i> 45). Finally, he muses on the composition of the res
projected onto this support, concluding that

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In this way, one after the other men arranged [<i>ordonn&#x000E8;rent</i>]
these res, although a final ensemble was never their objective. They
positioned these res by instinct in such a way that, in the end,
an ensemble formed all on its own. . . . and, since nothing during
their period prohibited it, they often allowed one painting to encroach
on an earlier painting [<i>ils empi&#x000E9;t&#x000E8;rent souvent sur
les parties peintes auparavant</i>]; however, rarely did they disturb
[<i>ils d&#x000E9;rang&#x000E8;rent rarement</i>] that which came before
if it contributed to the magnificence of the Hall . . . [<i>L,</i> 45]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A glance at the photograph of the Rotunda in the Hall of the Bulls that
accompanied Bataille's text suggests precisely what he was looking at when
writing the words above (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). In his description,
Bataille seems torn between, on the one hand, his desire to express
astonishment at the way in which the res encroach upon one another
and, on the other, his desire to confirm the Lascaux painter's sense of
a larger "ensemble," his awareness of the need to maintain some sense
of order. When Bataille refers to the Hall's "magnificence" he seems to
be thinking of the four bulls whose large dimensions dominate the frieze
and lend the Rotunda its dramatic quality. It is true that the rative
power of the outlined bulls is not, as Bataille insists, diminished by the
"empi&#x000E8;tement," that is, by the intrusion of other, less refined
res. The magnificence of the Hall might even owe quite a bit to the
phenomenon of superimposition itself. Yet it is equally clear that no
discernable compositional principle is directing the order or rhythm of
the superimpositions. Thus the question remains&#x02014;raised by this
passage and by many others like it&#x02014;why the Lascaux painter did
not choose to respect the borders of the animals already represented,
why he consistently made one re act as the ground of the next,
thereby confusing one of the distinctions central to the development of
Western illusionist painting (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). If Lascaux
man was indeed


<b></b>


capable of composition, and therefore of caring about the way in which
the res were positioned with respect to one another, then why did
he so often ignore the boundaries of earlier res and threaten the
majesty of the final effect?

<p>
In an effort to avoid either reducing the phenomenon of superimposition
to a "fouillis . . . d'innombrable gravures enchev&#x000EA;tr&#x000E9;es"
(<i>L,</i> 58) or, conversely, elevating&#x02014;and thus
domesticating&#x02014;the phenomenon by revealing the work of hidden
calculation, Bataille


<b></b>


offers the paradox of unintentional order (or what he calls an
"ordonnance . . . d&#x000E9;sordonn&#x000E9;e"). There is indeed a "calcul"
(calculation) governing the distribution of res on the cave walls,
but, he hastens to add, it has nothing to do with the instrumental
rationality of, for instance, vanishing point perspective: "This
calculation [<i>Ce calcul</i>] must not be identified with the type of
calculation that art would later make its own" (<i>L,</i> 46). Further,
although it might appear that "the individual elements are subordinated
to the final ensemble," such subordination is not imposed externally but
arrived at organically, as a result of a "blind," "animal" assurance:
"there is something <i>animal-like</i> [<i>quelque chose d'animal</i>]in
the <i>blind assurance</i> [<i>l'aveugle s&#x000FB;ret&#x000E9;</i>]
with which the Lascaux painters, <i>without ever having planned it</i>
[<i>sans l'avoir jamais concert&#x000E9;</i>], attained their result"
(<i>L,</i> 46; emphasis added). Thus, even as Bataille notes that an
"ensemble" emerges out of the mass of superimposed res, he stresses
that this ensemble was never intended, was never "their object." The
composition at work in the cave is linked not to calculation but to
"blind instinct," to repeated gestures associated with somatic (as
opposed to rational) knowledge. Finally, lest the weight of words like
"composition," "ordonnance," and "calcul" fall too heavily on the ears of
his audience, Bataille reiterates a few pages later, in his description of
a gallery further down, the words "instinct" and "chance" with reference,
once again, to composition. "I want to emphasize the charm derived from
this order [<i>ordonnance</i>], arrived at through chance and <i>blind
instinct</i> alone" (<i>L,</i> 51; emphasis added).
<p>
At times, Bataille appears to parse out the opposition between
"calculation" and "blind instinct," or aesthetic rationality and
spontaneous, instinctual marking, along a spectrum of depictions, with,
on the one hand, the most distinct and obviously composed res serving
to embody the advanced capacities of prehistoric artists, and, on the
other, the most indistinguishable and tumultuously juxtaposed res
representing the less familiar practices of a variety of man that remains
strange to us. For instance, in the Axial Gallery, Bataille discovers
what looks like "three Chinese horses," a set of delicate res
that seem to him to be among "the most refined, the most attractive of
Lascaux" (<i>L,</i> 51), neatly outlined and distinguished from the other
res in a composition that comes close to suggesting a scene. On the
other end of the spectrum is the "series of a dozen or so small horses"
stretching across the back wall, which seem to be traced more summarily,
with less attention to final effect. "These animals," notes Bataille,
"are distinguished from the others <i>arranged</i> in the Hall by
their vague and undecided aspect: they are, in this sense, more animal,
<i>liberated of all intention</i>" (<i>L,</i> 53; emphasis added).
<p>
The reader is here reminded of Bataille's earlier review article
on Luquet's <i>Art primitif</i> in which he argues that two kinds
of art&#x02014;that which is refined and that which projects a "vague
aspect"&#x02014;emerge from a single impulse to "alter." However, there is
no mention in <i>Lascaux</i> of the word "alteration" (nor does the word
"graffiti" ever appear, and thus the issue of defacement in the caves
is not broached).
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Furthermore, in <i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille repudiates in no uncertain
terms Luquet's thesis that prehistoric art bears a kinship with the
drawings of "primitives" (indigenous peoples) or children.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
What Bataille does retain from his previous work on Luquet is the
idea that


<b></b>


both kinds of depictions, the refined and the summary, the intentionally
arranged and the chaotic, originate in a more fundamental impulse,
a libidinal impulse, motivating the expenditure of physical energy in
the making of the mark.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Both the orderly and the seemingly disorderly are animated by the same
dynamism, by a compositional principle that, in effect, is not so much
a principle as a force expressing "quelque chose d'animal" (<i>L,</i>
46). This force is so strong that no composed, independent grouping,
even that of the subtly executed horses, can remain unaffected by the
"vaste mouvement" ultimately governing the constellation of images
throughout the cave (<i>L,</i> 51). Sometimes this movement seems to
be propelling all the res in the same direction, as in the Hall of
the Bulls, where Bataille discovers in the "cavalcade spectaculaire"
"un mouvement unique"; at other times, as in the Axial Gallery, the
res seems to move "in all directions, upsetting the possibility
of an ensemble with the suddenness of a leap" (<i>L,</i> 49). In all
cases, however, underlying depiction at Lascaux is something strange
and seductive to which we are sensitive&#x02014;"ce qui nous touche. . . est <i>ce qui bouge"</i> (that which touches us . . . is <i>that
which moves</i>)&#x02014;something that expresses "with a strength
never surpassed an animal violence, anguished, erotic, and blind"
(<i>L,</i> 57).
<p>
Bataille's allusion to an "anguished," "blind," and "erotic
violence"&#x02014;which he treats as both the theme of the images and
the impulse generating them&#x02014;recalls the very terms he borrowed
earlier from Luquet in <i>L'Art primitif</i>. Whereas Bataille clearly
wants to avoid identifying the Lascaux images with the art of children
and "primitives," he nonetheless has to strive to prevent comparisons
between the cave and the Sistine Chapel from domesticating the frenetic
energies he sees reflected on the cave walls. In a sense, then, Bataille
needs Luquet's emphasis on the libidinal origins of mark-making to
oppose the excesses of art historians such as Windels, and he needs
Windels's emphasis on aesthetic rationality to oppose the excesses of
comparative ethnographers and psychologists such as Luquet. For Windels,
the phenomenon of superimposition indicates man's search for perfection,
his ever-increasing capacity to make mimetic forms that fall into orderly
patterns. For Luquet, in contrast, the phenomenon of superimposition is
evidence of an "imitation machinale," a kind of instinctual urge to make
and leave traces.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Finally, for Bataille, superimposition is the phenomenon that places
the two&#x02014;the instinctual and the technical, the disorderly and the
orderly&#x02014;within one space; but the point is not simply that creation
and deformation coincide as one re encroaches upon another, but
more that the production of a clear ration, a composed "ensemble,"
<i>is not the goal of aesthetic behavior</i>. The nearly ubiquitous
phenomenon of superimposition in Paleolithic representation suggests
that the process, and not the product, is sovereign. By concentrating
on this phenomenon, on the way it unsettles familiar accounts of
artistic production, Bataille thus manages to chart a course through
the choppy waters of Paleolithic scholarship, which tends to err either
by denying Paleolithic man an artistic practice (because there is no
"souci de composition"), or by reducing all Paleolithic expressions to
the monumental, static beauty of Greek, Roman, and Renaissance models.


<b></b>


<p>
Alone among Bataille scholars, the art historian Georges Didi-Huberman
has recognized to what a great extent the phenomenon of superimposition
encapsulates, for Bataille, the enigma of aesthetic practice itself. In
<i>La Ressemblance informe,</i> Didi-Huberman suggests that <i>Lascaux</i>
merely approaches from a new angle questions concerning the kinetic
element of artistic production first raised in <i>Documents:</i>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When Bataille . . . describes in "L'Art primitif" what seems to constitute
the most elementary dialectic of alteration&#x02014;the rhythmic act of
aggression against a support, the discovery in this rhythm of visual
resemblances, the reproduction of these resemblances, then another
act of aggression in a process of "successive destructions"&#x02014;he
touches on one of the major problems he will treat in his work, the full
implications of which will not be explored until twenty-five years later,
in his book on Lascaux. [<i>RI,</i> 277]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "rhythmic act of aggression against a support" is related,
Didi-Huberman claims, to what Bataille observed in the caves, a "travail
d'empi&#x000E8;tement" (the work of encroachment) or "enchev&#x000EA;trement"
that produces form but also, by neglecting a previous form's integrity,
alters form beyond recognition (<i>RI,</i> 277). Didi-Huberman confirms
the connection, therefore, between nonrative tracings (such as those
studied by Luquet at Gargas) and the rative depictions Bataille finds
heaped in tangled masses on the walls of Lascaux; both are generated
by "rhythmic acts of aggression," the repeated gestures of a body in
motion. The phenomenon of superimposition in particular, it would seem,
reveals the fundamental ambiguity of aesthetic behavior, testifying,
in Didi-Huberman's terms, to a contact between the subject as producer,
possessing agency and intention, and the subject as "subjectile," energy
"thrown" (<i>jet&#x000E9;e</i> [<i>RI,</i> 277]), or, as Jacques Derrida
has put it, "force before form."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
The mark left behind registers the quantity of physical force
applied, a force that is subjectivity embodied in space, duration,
and movement. The practice of "enchev&#x000EA;trement," Didi-Huberman
writes, produces the impression that static forms are provisional and
expendable expressions of this underlying kinetic force; what perdures,
beyond the forms themselves, is movement&#x02014;"an extraordinary
<i>movement</i> that confounds the spectator" (<i>RI,</i> 277; italics
in original). Form communicates the movements that constituted it;
viewing bodies not only respond viscerally to these movements but,
in the case of the image-makers, viewing bodies <i>prolong</i> these
movements by repeating them, by joining the dance of mark-marking once
again, contributing to "an image that will never cease being constructed,
growing through its alterations from one generation of artists to the
next . . ." (<i>RI,</i> 278).
<p>
Finally, what Bataille sees at Lascaux is not simply a "fouillis de
peintures" or an "embrouillamini" of innumerable, interlocking res,
but also, Didi-Huberman concludes, a "<i>temporal</i> function of
representation." Bataille "saw that superimposition and encroachment
[<i>l'enchev&#x000EA;trement et l'empi&#x000E8;tement</i>] themselves imply
an essential anthropological function, a <i>temporal</i> function of
ration" (<i>RI,</i> 278; italics in original). Superimposed images
seem to materialize temporal passage, providing, as Didi-Huberman remarks,
an "anthropological" context for image-making, a clear reference to
successive generations. The "exub&#x000E9;rance" of their multiplicitous
interweavings suggests


<b></b>


both a past and a future of the mark-making impulse (<i>RI,</i> 278). But
to make this observation is really no more than to reiterate the point
Breuil had already made concerning the chronology of the different sets
of marks. What Didi-Huberman could have emphasized more strongly is that
the gestures required for mark-making (intentionally or accidentally
altering a support, intentionally or accidentally creating an image),
also take place in time, are performed within duration. It may be that
the successive strokes point to a future of further alterations ("an
image that will never cease being constructed"). But these strokes also
testify to the importance of <i>their performance in lived time</i>. The
act of executing the movements involved in the <i>performance</i> might
very well have held greater value for Paleolithic producers than did
the images (products) themselves. And this possibility is confirmed by
Bataille himself: "The entanglement of res," he writes, "signifies
that existing decorations were of negligible importance at the moment
when a new mark was made. In this moment, whether or not the new mark
destroyed the former and perhaps more beautiful one was a secondary
concern" (<i>L,</i> 79).
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
Such, ultimately, is Bataille's conclusion. Certainly, on one level,
the movement propelling the repetition of marks is simply "the
agitation of forms [<i>la mise en mouvement des formes</i>] and the
continual reinvention of their relations," as Didi-Huberman would have it
(<i>RI,</i> 279). But Bataille suggests further that Lascaux man may not
have been as interested in altering forms or reinventing their relations
as he was in <i>repeating certain gestures,</i> gestures that formed
part of a ritual performance, or a dance. Bataille makes it clear that
he does not understand art (as finished product) to be subordinate to
the performance of instrumental rituals; but he does intimate that both
art <i>and</i> instrumental rituals are subordinate to something else,
something sovereign: namely, the motricity of the body itself. Throughout
<i>Lascaux</i>, Bataille returns again and again to the theme of movement,
a "mouvement de jeu," a "mouvement de f&#x000EA;te," and a "mouvement"
of transgression (<i>L,</i> 40-2), all of which constitute related
incarnations of "un mouvement ind&#x000E9;termin&#x000E9; dans son essence"
(<i>L,</i> 48), or movement itself. It is this indeterminate movement that
propels Lascaux man from "animal night" to the portal of civilization;
but it is also, paradoxically, this indeterminate movement that helps him
recover, transgressively, the joy and anguish of "la sensibilit&#x000E9;
imm&#x000E9;diate." Image-making draws on this indeterminate movement,
this force, modeling physical expressions of the body in order to produce
material results.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
While it might at first seem that Bataille is merely using the term
"mouvement" ratively (as a synonym for "impulse," for instance), it
becomes fully apparent in his conclusion that "mouvement" is to be taken
quite literally, as the body's displacement in space, or, as he writes,
a "mouvement de danse" (<i>L,</i> 80). Bataille closes <i>Lascaux</i>
by reflecting at some length upon the imbrication of image-making in
ritual choreographies. "What distinguishes the images of Lascaux in
general is that they are integrated into rites," begins Bataille:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We do not know what these rites were, but we are encouraged to
believe that the execution of the paintings comprised one of their
elements. Tracing a re did not, perhaps, on its own constitute a
ceremony; but it was certainly an essential part of a ceremony.


<b></b>


Tracing was an <i>operation</i>, religious or magic. . . . Concern for the
final effect clearly emerged at Lascaux&#x02014;in the arrangement of the
Great Hall, or in the Gallery, for instance. However, of this we can be
sure: the final effect of the ensemble was of secondary importance. Only
the operation [of tracing] corresponded to the underlying intention. The
majesty of the cavern appeared afterwards, serendipitous, like a gift,
or the sign of divinity. [<i>L,</i> 79; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas earlier, Bataille had sought to disentangle artistic processes
from ritual intentions, here he resituates image-making in the larger
context of a coordinated "<i>op&#x000E9;ration.</i>" Bataille even
insists that completing this operation was the primary intention of
the image-maker; the beauty of the image produced was simply a "don du
hasard" (or a sign of divinity). What is most important to Bataille,
then, is not the secondary purpose Paleolithic man believed he was
fulfilling&#x02014;propitiating a god, assuring the abundance of the
harvest or of the hunt, or even creating a "work of art"&#x02014;but rather
the corporeal energy the operation was modeling. It is ultimately this
energy, the energy of moving bodies, that is communicated to us from the
walls of the cave. The instrumentality of the ritual, the <i>opera</i>
(labor) of the "op&#x000E9;ration," gives temporary and fleeting form to
a physical force that always wants to reach beyond it&#x02014;to further
depictions, or to us:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What we feel at Lascaux, what touches us . . . <i>is that which moves</i>
[<i>Ce qui est sensible &#x000E0; Lascaux, ce qui nous touche . . .</i>
est ce qui bouge]. A feeling of the spirit dancing [<i>Un sentiment de
danse de l'esprit</i>] uplifts us before these works in which, without
regimentation [<i>sans routine</i>] beauty emanates from feverish
movements. . . . This movement of feverish dance [<i>Ce mouvement de
danse enivr&#x000E9;e</i>] always had the force to elevate art above the
subordinate tasks it accepted, tasks that religion or magic imposed upon
it . . . This free movement is most palpable [<i>le plus sensible</i>]
at Lascaux . . ." [<i>L,</i> 80-1; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "mouvement de danse" to which Bataille refers is responsible both for
lifting the images above their limited, local tasks and for <i>bringing
the images into existencein the first place</i>. For such dance movements,
or choreographed gestures (organized into what Leroi-Gourhan calls
"operating chains"), must be performed in order for ration to
gain a visible being. Further, not only are material bodies involved
in the execution of images, but material bodies, <i>our</i> material
bodies, Bataille seems to be saying, are involved in perceiving and
appreciating images. Our bodies resonate to the movement captured on,
and communicated to us through, the cave walls. The images of Lascaux are
therefore movement (space, duration) made <i>sensible</i> to us through
our eyes. While describing Lascaux, Bataille concentrates more often
than not on what the viewer <i>feels</i> rather than on what he sees
(although we are always feeling <i>through</i> our optical organs). We
are "touched" in the cave, he writes, by that which "<i>moves,</i>" or,
to put it in slightly more phenomenological terms, we see movement and
are moved&#x02014;inspired to move&#x02014;by what we see. As if to lend
support to such a phenomenology of vision, Merleau-Ponty, in the last
essay he wrote before his death in 1960, seconds Bataille's motion:
"An instrument that itself moves . . . ," we read in <i>L'Oeil et
l'esprit,</i> "the eye is <i>that which</i> was moved [<i>&#x000E9;mu</i>]
by a certain impact of the world and returns this world to visibility
by means of the tracings of the hand [<i>par les traces de la main</i>].


<b></b>


No matter where it is born, no matter what ceremonies surround it, and
even if it was placed in the service of something entirely different,
painting&#x02014;from Lascaux to now&#x02014;never celebrates anything
other than the enigma of visibility . . . Painting awakens; it brings
to its greatest point of intensity the delirium that is vision itself
[<i>un d&#x000E9;lire qui est la vision m&#x000EA;me</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Bataille also ends his <i>Lascaux</i> with reference to seeing as a kind
of "d&#x000E9;lire." Not only does looking at the cave walls produce in
him a sense of "&#x000E9;merveillement," but he finds that his visual
experience causes his spirit to "dance"; he is affected viscerally by
the imagery's "danse &#x000E9;nivr&#x000E9;e" (<i>L,</i> 81). This "danse
enivr&#x000E9;e" which the eye experiences when observing the images
on the support of the cave is related in Bataille's text to the "danse
enivr&#x000E9;e" of the ritual during which, hypothetically, the images
were produced in the cave. Although Bataille's strongest influences,
Breuil and Windels, make only passing reference to such dances, they too
tacitly advance the notion that cave images were executed during a ritual
performance. Recent research on cave images, both ancient and modern,
has supported, in fact, the turn-of-the-century ethnographer's suggestion
that various forms of inscription (tracing, drawing, even notation and
therefore early writing systems) originated in rituals involving not
only choreographed movements, but also the production, with the aid of a
shaman, of visual hallucinations. According to contemporary paleographers
Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams, it was these visual hallucinations
that prered and determined the images to be projected onto the cave
walls, while the choreographed movements of ritual dances provided the
first gestures responsible, eventually, for all varieties of inscription.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The origin of art&#x02014;and the source of art's "elevation" above its
culturally assigned tasks&#x02014;turns out to be not a rage for order
but a delirious dance.
<p>
Bataille did not live long enough to witness the return of Paleolithic
archaeology to a more anthropological, comparatist perspective. And
he probably would have been uncomfortable with the relation assumed
between depictive practices and particular belief systems (associated
with the shamanic practice of healing or conjuring). However, the aspect
of contemporary archaeology that he would have appreciated, and that his
own study anticipated, is the tendency exemplified by Lewis-Williams and
Clottes to approach aesthetic behaviors as implicated in a quest for the
sacred through rhythmic movement, such movement being understood as an
end in itself. Central to Paleolithic image-makers, such a notion implies,
was not the accuracy or perfection of the depictions, but rather <i>that
they were performed</i>. What mattered, in other words, was that the
gestures of mark-making were repeated in a sacred space&#x02014;such as
the cave, an underworld or alternative virtual universe populated with
hallucinated images that one could both see and retrace. Bataille himself
informs us at the beginning of <i>Lascaux</i> that he would not have been
able to experience Lascaux fully without placing his own body in that
same sacred space of the cave. Clearly, for Bataille, using the eyes is
by no means an act detached from the rest of the body. Seeing and being
"moved," gesturing and making visual images, are mutually implicated
aesthetic&#x02014;and sensual&#x02014;practices. The inevitable response
to the visual world is to leave, as Merleau-Ponty puts it, "les traces
de la main." Writing <i>Lascaux</i> (see <a href="#8"> 8</a>)
represents Bataille's own participation in that dance of the hand.

that the project was the joint brain-child of Bataille and Albert Skira,
editor of the series in which it appeared, "Les Grands Si&#x000E8;cles
de la peinture." Apparently, it was Bataille who, having been solicited
by Skira to contribute to the series, "suggested the idea" of a book
on Lascaux, perhaps as a complement to his study of modern painting
entitled <i>Manet</i> printed in the series the same year. See Georges
Bataille, <i>Lascaux, ou la naissance de l'art,</i> in <i>Oeuvres

<i>Lascaux</i> is too often placed in the service of reconfirming
Bataille's "transgressive" stance vis-&#x000E0;-vis academic conventions
and disciplinary procedures. Steven Ungar's defense of the work in
"Phantom Lascaux, Origin of the Work of Art," for instance, rests
largely on a vision of <i>Lascaux</i> as transgressive that cannot be
substantiated (<i>Yale French Studies</i> 78, "On Bataille," ed. Alan
Stoekl [1990]). Although Ungar claims that Bataille's "gestures of
transgression" produce "textual effects [in <i>Lascaux</i>] whose
intensity is unsettling" , he provides no example of these

Bataille spent some time ascertaining the exact circumstances of the
cave's discovery. In a paper he gave in 1955 (on the occasion of the
presentation of a film on Lascaux), he informs his audience that two
of the boys who came upon the cave opening (exposed when a tree was
uprooted by


<b></b>


a storm) were in fact not local P&#x000E9;rigordians, but rather wartime
refugees from Paris. One of the boys, Bataille claims, was Jewish. It
seems that the three of them had gone off to "play war" with a group
of Alsatian boys, also refugees, staying in the area. In search of
their companions, they bump into Marcel Ravidat, a P&#x000E9;rigordien,
who had heard from a neighbor about a mysterious hole possibly leading
to a cave. The three boys decide to join Ravidat&#x02014;and the rest
is history. See "Conf&#x000E9;rence du 18 janvier 1955," in <i>Oeuvres
compl&#x000E8;tes,</i> 9:336. I have not found evidence to corroborate
Bataille's account, but I am nonetheless moved that he wanted to
communicate to his audience that the popularized version (the one shown
in the film) passes in silence over the participation of a Jewish boy
in the discovery of one of France's most important national treasures.

Bataille's own text forces me to depict the Lascaux painters as "men." As

The urge Bataille exhibits to associate the emergence of mankind with
the birth of art reveals his Eurocentric cast of mind, as well as
that of Western European prehistorians working from the time decorated
caves were first discovered in 1837 until Bataille's generation. Recent
findings prove that <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i> existed in places other
than France and Spain long before the cave images were produced. Conkey
summarizes these findings in "Beyond Art": "<i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>
(anatomically-modern humans) now appear to have established themselves
outside of Europe a considerable time before the appearance there of
preserved Upper Paleolithic imagery at some 32,000 years ago . . . there
is increasing support for image-making or at least 'marking' at comparably
early dates elsewhere (in southern Africa and Australia, at least). Thus,
the Upper Paleolithic imagery of Eurasia is liberated from what has
been persistent, almost 'vitalistic' concepts of 'context' in which the
art 'happens' with modern humans, and the European materials are the
<i>origins</i> of art" (344; italics in original). On the significance
of Lascaux for European self-conceptions, see also Jean-Paul Demoule,
"Lascaux," in <i>Les Lieux de la m&#x000E9;moire,</i> ed. Pierre Nora
(Paris: Gallimard, 1997).
<p>
<a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>.
Much could be&#x02014;and has been&#x02014;said about Bataille's concern
with the distinction between the animal and the human. From his very
earliest essays, such as "Le Gros Orteil" (The big toe) of 1929, on,
Bataille is working out a theory of man's relation to the animal. In
<i>Th&#x000E9;orie de la religion</i>, for instance, Bataille suggests
that man's sense of superiority over the animals is tempered by his
inarticulable intimation of continuity with them.
<p>
<a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>.
The first scholar to focus attention on unique patterns within
a single cave (rather than generating abstract theories based on
ethnographic comparisons) was the Polish/German art historian, Max
Rapha&#x000EB;l; see his <i>Prehistoric Cave Painting</i> (New York:
Pantheon, 1945). The French structuralist, Andr&#x000E9; Leroi-Gourhan,
followed suit a generation later. Leroi-Gourhan's major work on the
mythic structures of cave representations is <i>Pr&#x000E9;histoire de
l'art occidental</i> (Paris: Mazenod, 1965); <i>Treasures of Prehistoric
Art,</i> trans. Norbert Guterman (New York: Abrams, 1965). Here he
argues that at Lascaux, the marks interpreted as "arrows" by promoters
of the hunting magic theory are actually "male" and "female" signs:
"male symbols are inserted into the large compositions, the most
frequent type of which is based on the grouping comprising bison/horse
with female-signs/male-signs . . . In other words, it is highly probable
that Paleolithic men were expressing something like 'spear is to penis'
as 'wound is to vulva'" (172-3). An important, but less well-known
prehistorian was Annette Laming-Emperaire; in <i>La Signification de
l'art rupestre pal&#x000E9;olithique</i> (Paris: Picard, 1962) she had
the prescience to guide scholarship toward considering each cave in its
specific context. On the significance of Leroi-Gourhan and his followers,
see Jean Clottes, "Art of the Light and Art of the Depths," in Conkey,
ed., <i>Beyond Art</i>.

Bataille was, it should be noted, impressed by Evelyne Lot-Falck's <i>Les
Rites de chasse chez les peuples sib&#x000E9;riens,</i> published in 1953
and included in his bibliography. He returns to Lot-Falck's theory in
<i>L'&#x000C9;rotisme</i> (without citing her) in his discussion of the
"Scene in the Shaft." Bataille prefers Lot-Falck's theory to Lindner's
because she places greater emphasis on the religious signification (rather
than the instrumental value) of depiction as part of sympathetic magic
rituals. For further analysis of Lot-Falck's place in the evolution of
paleographic archaeology, see Mario Ruspoli, <i>The Cave of Lascaux:
The Final Photographic Record</i> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1987), 62-4.

See "Architecture," from the "Dictionnaire critique" published in
<i>Documents,</i> no. 2  in which Bataille distinguishes modern
painting (by which he means the works of Picasso, Masson, Van Gogh,
and Dali) from forms of art which he believes to be in the service of
repressions (prohibitions): "as strange as it might seem when what is
in question is a creature as elegant as the human being, these [modern]
painters indicate a path leading toward bestial monstrosity; as though
there were no other chance of escaping from the architectural prison
[<i>la chiourme architecturale</i>]" (Georges Bataille, <i>Documents,</i>

<i>graffite</i> in paleography, but my own reading of a large number of
articles in anthropological and archaeological journals suggests that
the term was used early on (mid-nineteenth century) to designate cave
depictions that had not yet entered the field of art history. The terms
<i>graffite</i> and <i>graffiti</i> slowly drop out of usage and are
replaced by <i>peintures</i> and <i>gravures</i> as an art historical
approach assumes dominance in paleographic research. As we shall see,
the term <i>graffite</i> is reserved by Breuil to refer uniquely to
those inscriptions&#x02014;engraved or painted&#x02014;that appear either
unfinished, carelessly traced, or repetitively superimposed.

Certain aspects of Reinach's theory leave their traces even in Breuil's
most mature writings, notably his famous <i>Quatre cents si&#x000E8;cles

that "when we visit a decorated cavern, we penetrate a sanctuary where,
thousands of years ago, sacred ceremonies took place" (<i>QCS,</i>
23), or when he seems to adopt the view of a fellow prehistorian,
Maxime Vaultier, that the human re found in the "Hall of the Bulls"
represents a "Sorcerer" (<i>QCS,</i> 130).

Monaco, 1906, p. 369, quoted in "PHP," 326. Whitney Davis credits
Cartailhac as well as Breuil with ushering cave images into the domain
of art history. "After 1902 [the date of Cartailhac's "mea culpa"],
cave art became suffused with art historicity, quickly assimilated to
familiar forms of art making" (<i>Replications,</i> 154-5).

On the Hegelian (teleological and developmental) cast of nineteenth- and
early twentieth-century art history, see Michael Podro, <i>The Critical
Historians of Art</i> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1982). On
French art history in particular, see Udo Kultermann, <i>The History of
Art History</i> (n.p.: Abaris Books, 1993). During the nineteenth century,
French art history was influenced by Burckhardt's large, overarching
historical concepts and Taine's sense of periodization. By the end of
the century, Elie Faure had broadened the curriculum to include the
study of "primitive" arts; Saloman Reinach and Paul Gauguin also had
a significant impact on art history's growing interest in non-Western
(and prehistorical) arts. Breuil (1877-1961) emerged out of this context.
<p>
<a name="FOOT36" href="#REF36">36</a>.
See L. Capitan, L'Abb&#x000E9; H. Breuil, and D. Peyrony, <i>Les
Combarelles aux Ezies (Dordogne)</i> (Paris: Masson, 1924), which is
full of references to "styles," "oeuvres d'art," and so on, even as it
continually compares Paleolithic images to those produced by contemporary
hunter-gatherer societies considered primitive ("arri&#x000E9;r&#x000E9;")
by the same authors.

"A limited circle of gifted individuals, who certainly came
from the ranks of professional magicians [<i>des magiciens de
m&#x000E9;tier</i>], created these works. . . . Apparently, schools
[<i>des &#x000E9;coles</i>] existed, each possessing their own style
[<i>leur style propre</i>]. The young artist [<i>Le jeune artiste</i>]
received an education, was trained [<i>entra&#x000EE;n&#x000E9;</i>]
before being allowed to take on the greatest tasks that awaited him"
(Lindner, <i>Chasse pr&#x000E9;historique,</i> 275). I suspect that
Lindner's source for these terms is a work by Breuil's associates,
L. Capitan and J. Bouyssonie, <i>Un atelier d'art pr&#x000E9;historique:
Limeuil</i> (Paris, 1924). Lindner also applies verbatim Breuil's
art historical chronological frame for interpreting cave imagery; see
pp. 252-4. Needless to say, Breuil's chronological system as well as
Leroi-Gourhan's revision of it have been completely debunked as a result
of the discovery of Chauvet Pont d'Arc in the Ard&#x000E8;che. Scholars are
still debating the age of Chauvet; the first radiocarbon datings suggested
that paintings were executed between 31,000 and 26,000 <small>B.C.</small>

This little red notebook can be found in the Fonds Bataille housed in
the Cabinet des Manuscrits of the Biblioth&#x000E8;que nationale de Paris,
Rue Richelieu (Fonds Bataille, bo&#x000EE;te no. 3, dossier XI). The remarks
jotted down in this modest notebook led me to consider the phenomenon of
superimposition&#x02014;and thus the places where it appears, such as the
Hall of the Bulls, the Apse, and the Chamber of Felines&#x02014;to be a
more important key to understanding Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> than the
famous "Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits."
<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
A third exigency faces Bataille: he must also strive to insert the visual
evidence of Lascaux into his prefabricated mythology of transgression;
that is why he later privileges the "Sc&#x000E8;ne du puits," emphasizing
what he takes to be its themes of sex and death. I am more interested
here in the moments when Bataille appears mesmerized by the chaotic
masses of superimposed res that do not submit so easily to thematic
recuperation. For a critique of Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> that neglects
the degree to which he develops a theory of superimposition independent
of his earlier&#x02014;and later&#x02014;work, see Jean Louis Schefer,
<i>Questions d'art pal&#x000E9;olithique</i> (Paris: P.O.L., 1999).

Bataille's avoidance of the term <i>graffiti</i> (or <i>graffite</i>)
is interesting in itself: at one point, when speaking of the "abside,"
Bataille quotes Breuil almost verbatim, but replaces Breuil's "graffite"
with the more dignified appellation, "gravures": "Cette salle est
l'une des plus curieuses de la caverne, mais elle ne pr&#x000E9;sente
&#x000E0; la vue qu'un fouillis de peintures en partie effac&#x000E9;es et

<a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>.
"Lascaux distances us from the art of backward peoples [<i>l'art des
peuples arri&#x000E9;r&#x000E9;s</i>]," Bataille writes firmly; "It draws
us closer to the art of the most refined and effervescent civilizations"
(<i>L,</i> 80).
<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
Bataille writes in <i>L'Art primitif</i>: "Art . . . proceeds
in this sense by successive destructions. Thus, insofar as art
liberates <i>libidinal</i> instincts, these instincts are sadistic"
(in <i>Documents,</i> 139; italics in original).
<p>
<a name="FOOT46" href="#REF46">46</a>.
Georges-Henri Luquet, <i>L'Art et la religion des hommes fossiles</i>
(Paris: Masson, 1926), 134. In the case of the Aurignacians, Luquet
writes, the origin of representation must be sought "in the lines that
the author traced not with the intention of decorating or ring,
but simply in order to trace" . For an astute consideration (and
extension) of Luquet's views, see Whitney Davis, <i>Replications.</i>
Davis argues that the "digital flutings" on the walls of Gargas (the
same cave Luquet studied) provide a clue to the conditions out of which
image-making arose: "The tracing," Davis notes, "has internal rhythms of
its own. . . . In the flickering semidarkness, our visitor to the cave
may have momentarily mistaken some of the marks&#x02014;whether made by her
or by anyone else&#x02014;as animal forms, but they were not necessarily
representations of animals for just that reason. . . . she would already
learn that she could make the mark not just and only as a mark but also
as a mark that could be seen as an object. If and when she <i>remade</i>
that or that kind of mark for seeing-as&#x02014;knowing it was just a mark
but interested, now, in its object-resembling properties&#x02014;then she
made an image. Mark became remark. . . . But to reiterate, the very
first mark in this and the other replication sequences was not made
as an image but only as a mark" (39-40). Davis adds that the primary
impulse for mark-making might have had nothing whatsoever with the urge
to create depictions; marks are produced by human "scribbling or rhythmic
repetition" , and also by animal claws and paw prints .

It is odd to what a great extent Bataille's text echoes that of
his adversary, Henri B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n, who also grants much more
significance to the act of making the inscription than to its final
appearance. Presenting the very utilitarian thesis Bataille abhorred,
B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n writes in terms resembling Bataille's: "C'est que
'seule' l'ex&#x000E9;cution du dessin ou de la sculpture importait. La
repr&#x000E9;sentation de l'animal &#x000E9;tait un <i>acte</i> qui
valait par lui-m&#x000EA;me. Une fois que cet acte &#x000E9;tait accompli,
le r&#x000E9;sultat imm&#x000E9;diat et mat&#x000E9;riel de cet acte,
le dessin, n'avait plus aucune importance" ("Les Bases magiques," 211;
italics in original). B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n also bases his interpretation
on the phenomenon of superimposition . Despite his obvious influence,
I have found no reference to B&#x000E9;gou&#x000EB;n in Bataille's works.
<p>
<a name="FOOT49" href="#REF49">49</a>.
It is tempting to apply Bataille's theory of superimposition as a
practice that reveals the kinetic basis of inscription (developed
with reference to cave markings) to an interpretation of his preferred
aesthetic objects. An interest in superimposition might have governed,
for instance, Bataille's choice of illustrations for the 1944 edition
of <i>Histoire de l'oeil</i>, a set of four drawings by Hans Bellmer in
which overlapping rations form their own sort of "embrouillamini."

Bataille's <i>Lascaux</i> I now find myself in disagreement with Martin
Jay, who argues in <i>Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in
Twentieth-Century French Thought</i> (Berkeley: University of California
Press, 1993) that Bataille "mocked in advance Merleau-Ponty's benign
reembodiment of the eye in the 'flesh of the world'" . I explore

Lewis-Williams has asserted that "much Upper Paleolithic parietal
imagery was, in some measure, in some ways, shamanic," that it involved
"altered states of consciousness" that occur universally under particular
conditions. These states of trance induce what Lewis-Williams calls
"institutionalized hallucinations"; it is while participating in
one of these collective, ritualized trance states that human beings
execute <i>a set of repetitive gestures</i> leaving regular traces
upon walls. See David Lewis-Williams, "Harnessing the Brain: Vision and
Shamanism in Upper Paleolithic Western Europe," in <i>Beyond Art,</i>
322-4. See also Jean Clottes, <i>The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and
Magic in the Painted Caves,</i> trans. Sophie Hawkes (New York: Harry
N. Abrams, 1998). According to Clottes, vigorous dancing, chanting,
sensory deprivation, and prolonged social isolation may produce the
trance state consistent with the <i>homo sapiens sapiens</i> nervous
system . During this trance state geometric forms (grids, parallel
lines) appear and are projected onto the surface of the cave ; these
forms provide the first support for later rations, which are also
projected hallucinations, or memories of hallucinations, incited during
trance. The shaman theory, which combines ethnographic comparison and
close observation of individual caves, helps to explain: 1) the lack of
composition ("animals are, for the most part, unrelated to each other"
[92]); 2) the use of suggestive surfaces ("Touching may have led to the
creation of images" [86]); and 3) the phenomenon of superimposition,
which Clottes discusses with reference to the Apse ("abside") at Lascaux
(109-10).

<p>
<i>The Greek miracle</i> was alive. Sleeping under the foundations of
the Parthenon of Maurras and Winckelmann were <i>kouroi</i> with Khmer
smiles; archaeology woke them&#x02014;archaeology, which has overturned
the museums. Parricide daughter of humanism, archaeology presides over
digs which present us with the Thinite dynasties of Egypt, precolumbian
America, the ancient empires of China. If it removes Minos's halo of
legends, it is in order to give him back his palaces, their treasures,
their frescoes.
<p>
We thus no longer go to the museum like our fathers did. If Louis Aragon
and Jean Lur&#x000E7;at brought their top hat and bowler back to Madrid,
they would still neglect the Prado, but they would go in search of
Altamira.
<p>
In museums our fathers summoned the moderns to compare them with the
ancients; it is there again that we summon the ancients to compare them
with the moderns: the two are equal. Racine is quite far from Euripides,
but things are beginning to come clear.
<p>
However, we have joined to this broader knowledge the disgrace of
artistic liberalism: enough of worthless eclecticism! Our sensibility,
liberated from all altruistic concerns, aspires to more rigorous laws.
<p>
To contribute to this research we propose, in these <i>Cahiers,</i>
documents taken from diverse civilizations. The scientific apparatus
will be reduced to references.
<p>
And those who expect to return to the source will find fog . . .

<p>
Archaeology quite obviously deals with the past, as its name indicates,
but it is also the case that it does so in the present. It is very much
in the present, as and when it is practiced, that archaeology produces
knowledge about the past; it is in the present that this past is itself
appreciated and appropriated; and it is in the present that the many
values and uses it presents&#x02014;for the present&#x02014;are recognized
and pursued by its practitioners and promoters. That much we know: the
challenge is to translate this broad statement of principle into some
dedicated line of inquiry, one which would help us understand in much
more tangible and sensitive ways just what archaeology is all about,
and why is it of such interest in so many ways.
<p>
One way to do so, adding some complexity but also much-needed
enlightenment, is to turn to the history of archaeology. But not, of
course, just any history. Ever since the emergence of archaeology as a
field of scientific research, its practitioners have been interested
in their disciplinary past. All too often however this interest was
motivated by a concern for the creation of lineages and the legitimation
of authority. Encompassing the heroic accounts and accredited milestones
of discoveries, such internalist appreciations of the discipline have
often reduced themselves to a chronicle of the inexorable progress
of scientific knowledge. On the contrary, to delve fruitfully into
the disciplinary past, to appreciate the double lesson of familiarity
and alterity that it brings, to understand that at each of its moments
archaeology is practiced in the present, we need at the onset to adopt
a perspective that is both highly attentive and immune to veneration,
neither overly dazzled by the achievements of our


<b></b>


"genial founding fathers," nor, at the other extreme, dismissive towards
the supposedly "unscientific" errors of our predecessors. Alongside the
great discoveries, together with the persevering men (and sometimes
women) of genius, the history to be sought is that of the science in
action, of the half-forgotten controversies and errors of yesteryear,
of the routine operations so fundamental as to be self-evident, and
indeed of all these episodes and practices deemed unfit for inclusion
in the official or authorized histories of the discipline.
<p>
This last point, regarding the sources for the history of archaeology,
is indeed an important one. In terms of their contents, accessibility
and sheer quantity, archaeological publications obviously constitute
an important historical resource. But it must not be forgotten that
articles and monographs, regional syntheses, and interpretative essays
all constitute a literary genre in their own right, made to abide
by patterns of reference and authority, their scientific contents
recast according to ideal standards of objectivity and demonstration,
their rhetoric channeled into a retrospective succession of facts
and theory, methodology and results, solid knowledge and volatile
speculations. To reach the science in the making as much as the
applauded result, to grasp the quotidian as much as the extraordinary,
historians of archaeology need to turn to another essential resource,
namely the archives of the discipline. These are the various papers,
correspondence, manuscripts, drafts, internal documents, field-notes,
inventories, sketches, illustrations, prints, etc. produced as part of the
archaeological enterprise and accumulated since at least the seventeenth
century in museums, libraries, archaeological services, and archival
repositories. Archives constitute this crucial resource for re-collecting
and researching the history of archaeology&#x02014;a resource all the more
valuable if, for all its inherent fragility, occlusion and neglect, it
could be made known and accessible to a greater number of archaeologists
and historians who would then exploit and valorize these archives.
<p>
In effect, access to such archives makes it easier and more compelling
to appreciate the proposition that archaeology is, and has always been,
practiced in the present. And that, at each of the past events or episodes
of its practice that one may select: the 1930s quest for the cradle of
humankind in Africa, the sixteenth-century questions over <i>naturalia</i>
and <i>artificiosa,</i> the circumstances surrounding the opening of the
<i>Mus&#x000E9;e des antiquit&#x000E9;s nationales</i> in 1862, the running
of the schools of archaeology in Rome and Athens before the Second World
War, the schemes of artifact-based interpretative frameworks proposed by
C. J. Thomsen, Gabriel de Mortillet, Oscar Montelius, or William Flinders
Petrie, the background to the Folsom controversies in North America, the
debate over quaternary stratigraphy and its uses in nineteenth-century
Europe, the structuring of archaeological research in India and the Far
East after independence, the contemporary reception of Johann Winckelmann
and of the Comte de Caylus, etc.&#x02014;the chronological jumping back
and forth of these examples is of course deliberate, to remind us that
history really need not be a linear or teleological chronicle.

All this constitutes the rationale and modus operandi of the AREA
(ARchives of European Archaeology) network, a European Commission-funded
research project dedicated to researching and documenting the
history and the archives of archaeology. Leading institutions from
across Europe&#x02014;universities, museums, archaeological services,
research centers&#x02014;unite to encourage research on the history of
archaeology, to study and catalogue in a dedicated online database the
main archival fonds bearing on the history of the discipline, and to
explore the relations between the development of archaeology and the
challenges of cultural and political identity. More information about
the AREA network, its partners, activities, and productions can be
found at <i>www.area-archives.org</i>. Besides several publications,
the activities of the AREA network will focus for the coming months
on the organization of a major international conference, "Histories of
archaeology&#x02014;archives, ancestors, practices," which will be held in
G&#x000F6;teborg, Sweden, 17-19 June 2004. Further preliminary information
on the aims and scope of the conference, and contact coordinates, can

Archaeologies of the Modern
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
"Archaeologies of the Modern" invites a double explanation: first,
of a title that associates the modern(ist) scene with the excavation
of apparently fragmentary pasts; second, of the issue's unconventional
format. The issue is dialogical in structure and provocative in intent. It
conjoins essays authored by cultural historians and by archaeologists, and
accompanies each contribution by an archaeologist with a brief response
from a cultural historian, and vice versa. The aim of this device, as
well as of the special issue as a whole, is to inaugurate a dialogue
between reflections on archaeology as a modern discipline and inquiries
into the archaeological imagination in nineteenth- and twentieth-century
cultural forms. We believe that this dialogue transgresses the limits
of conventional interdisciplinarity because it excavates forms in the
cultural imaginary that find a home in no orthodox disciplinary field.
<p>
One simple and limited aim of the issue is to contribute to the new
history of archaeology. It was only in the 1980s that histories of the
publications of supposed great and originary minds in archaeology
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
were augmented by simple sociological and ideological motivation:
for example, middle-class Anglo-American experience reflected in
archaeological method and theory;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
nineteenth-century nationalisms fueling archaeological research into
local origins.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Research into the history of archaeology





based upon other than published sources had to wait until the mid-1990s
(notably associated with the AREA Project: see Nathan Schlanger's
contribution to the dossier in this issue).
<p>
Anything other than a strictly internalist account of archaeology may well
be far off, but there is more to archaeology than the discipline. Here
our issue's title points to a much wider aim of furthering what may be
called an archaeological history of modernity and its cultural imaginary,
modernism, through an exploration of their archaeological components.
<p>
To explain what we mean by this we begin with a classic modernist and
archaeological gesture (one of Duchamp's readymades) and then sketch
three archaeological moments of the last century or so. These lay the
ground for a glossary of some key features of archaeological discourse
that are the subject of this issue's papers.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
An Archaeological Gesture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Consider the snow shovel chosen by Marcel Duchamp as the protagonist
of <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i> . The shovel poses
fundamental questions about the nature of objects and their relation to
the world. Duchamp's shovel was bought off the shelf of a hardware store,
torn from the everyday and set in a museum gallery with a title. It is a
fragment of the material culture of the early twentieth century, a piece
of machine-age trash&#x02014;quite unexceptional. But in its association
with Duchamp, in its gallery siting, in its titling, it is also a special
shovel. It bears an argument about the character of contemporary art (the
gallery and its objects; the artist's work and choices). It preres
a narrative (contemporary newspapers had carried the story of a man who
had broken his arm clearing the streets of snow). It is also a relic,
an object of worship and even pilgrimage, a fetish&#x02014;preserved (and,
indeed, recreated) for posterity so as to keep alive a distinctly modern
practice of <i>decontextualization</i> and <i>recontextualization</i>.
<p>
The readymade piece of art is, of course, duplicitous. In the gallery
it betrays its function and elicits new significances only through this
betrayal. It is tagged with the story of a <i>future</i> denouement. It
doesn't dig, but breaks arms. Duchamp's <i>In Advance of the Broken
Arm</i> positions itself ahead of the work of digging, of uncovering
and amassing. The shovel is an avant-<i>bras:</i> we might push the
gesture further and say that <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i> moves
in advance of a <i>double</i> movement that would break the arm of
certain longstanding disciplinary conventions: an antiquarian tradition
in archaeology with its cult of the past as radical continuity; the
anti-antiquarian strain in studies of modernism and modernity with its
celebration of history as radical discontinuity. The shovel is a token
of digging, but only in a manner of speaking. No longer able to seek out
origins in depths, it instead excavates passages (snow removed from city
streets) across the labile, unsteady surfaces of an epoch that places
constant demands upon the recent and remote past while feverishly seeking
innovation; an epoch in which institutions dedicated to the recovery,
preservation, reconstruction, and display of ancient "finds" coexist with
institutions of countermemory dedicated to the cult of ever renewable,
ever new <i>trouvailles</i>. That such <i>trouvailles</i> may include


<b></b>


<i>trouv&#x000E8;res</i> or may choose to privilege ancient
textual/architectural remains (as in the cases of Eliot and Pound)
merely underscores the point.
<p>
Decontextualization and recontextualization&#x02014;how does this duplicity
and irony relate to the practices that long placed archaeology in the
service of historical, national, and international myths of origin
and (dis)continuity: of group identity formation (nationalisms), race
(ethnicity), technological progress, the rise and fall of civilizations,
and the like? And how does this distinctly modern(ist) culture of objects
intersect the history of archaeology itself, as well as more recent
critiques of archaeology, as it were, from the inside? Is the broken arm
that the shovel betokens a future in which archaeology excavates in the
service of discontinuity? These are among the questions that the present
special issue seeks to explore.

Modernist Dreams of An Other Archaeology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
To speak of a literal archaeology of the modern era might appear perverse
given the negative role assigned to archaeologists and antiquarians in
the most advanced expressions of modern culture. From Gustave Flaubert
to the avant-gardes and beyond, the archaeologist, whether amateur
or professional, has routinely been dismissed as an intransigent and
acritical worshipper of the past, and as an adversary of the new,
the unexpected, and the unknown. Indeed, when Flaubert sends his two
"imbeciles," Bouvard and P&#x000E9;cuchet, into archaeological raptures,
it is only to underscore their unthinking pretension, most tellingly when
they learn of phallic symbolism among the ancient Celts&#x02014;"and for
Bouvard and P&#x000E9;cuchet everything became a phallus. They collected
the swing-bars of carriages, legs of armchairs, cellar bolts, chemists'
pestles."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
In their archaeological excess, the pair recruits even the most
functional objects of material culture into a bathetic ancient symbolics;
their combination of rapt fetishism and autodidactic ignorance cruelly
parodies amateur antiquarianism. The 1909 Founding Manifesto of Futurism,
similarly, launches its incendiary appeal for a worship of the future
against "the fetid cancer of professors, archaeologists, tourist guides,
and antiques dealers."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Boccioni and the Futurist painters take aim at a similar list, denouncing
restorers, critics, and gouty academics, but singling out for special
attention "affected archaeologists with their chronic necrophilia."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Professors, tourist guides, antiques dealers, archaeologists: the
tumor of pass&#x000E9;ism was fed by the nineteenth century's seemingly
insatiable appetite for experiences of the past as present, whether
this meant continuity in the form of relics collected, inserted into
bourgeois interiors, or styles from the past revived and resurrected as
ornamental surfaces laid over machines or modern constructions. Whether
in its houses of secular worship (such as museums and libraries) or in
its amusement parks, the century constantly sought to animate the present
with expressions of a past that was felt to be ever more remote, thanks
to the tumultuous impact of the industrial revolution and the resulting
time-space compression and acceleration. But in its very remoteness that
past became material for reanimation from the dead into living forms,
as well as a realm of pleasurable fantasy and consumption associated
with leisure.


<b></b>


<p>
So when Tristan Tzara first codified the emancipatory nature of Dada's
work of demolition nearly a decade after Marinetti and Boccioni, the
archaeologist remained squarely in the line of fire:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
DADA; every object, all objects, feelings and obscurities, every
apparition and the precise shock of parallel lines, are means for
the battle of: DADA; the abolition of memory: DADA; the abolition of
archaeology: DADA the abolition of prophets: DADA; the abolition of
the future: DADA; the absolute and indisputable belief in every god
that is an immediate product of spontaneity . . . Liberty: DADA DADA
DADA;&#x02014;the roar of contorted pains, the interweaving of contraries
and all contradictions, freaks and irrelevancies: LIFE.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The avant-gardes' target is twofold: on the one hand, nineteenth-century
amateur archaeology as driven by the culture of connoisseurship
and collecting, associated with the country estate, the bourgeois
interior, and the museum as reliquary; on the other hand, a newly
emerging professional or "scientific" archaeology, driven by field
research and supported by academies and universities. The two are
collapsed into a single monolithic antiquarianism whose deeper logic
is declared insidious because it locates the past at the very core of
a conservative, continuity-based vision of the future. The diagnosis is
largely correct. Much as in the science fictions of Jules Verne, Edward
Bulwer-Lytton, and H. G. Wells, amateur and professional antiquarians
were committed to a futurology that either elevated objects outside of
time and space into a realm of transcultural and transhistorical beauty
(the cult of the masterpiece) and/or subordinated them within grand
evolutionary schemes and narratives in the service of a higher law
(progress, science, nationhood, humanity, God). Hence Tzara's leap
from archaeology- and memory-bashing to the bashing of prophets and
futurologists. And hence the importance granted to accidents, freaks,
and exceptions to any and every rule.
<p>
As is made explicit in Tzara's text, the abolition of archaeology
has nested within it a positive counterproposal. It stands as the
precondition for an other (and even <i>othering</i>) archaeology loosely
affiliated both with Freud's tracking of subterranean psychic and somatic
intensities, and with an ongoing modern preoccupation, extending from
Nietzsche through Artaud and Bataille, with tapping into "prehistoric"
instinctualisms, violence, savagery, sacrifice, and sacrality. Instead of
feeding necrophilia, this modernist archaeology purports to operate in the
service of life. It unburies life forms resistant to or hostile to Culture
and Civilization. Irreducible and intractable, its "finds" refuse to be
absorbed into grand narratives of nation-building, science, or progress
and yield surprises, shocks, thrills, and traumas. They belong either
to the realm of prehistory or to the material culture of the everyday.
<p>
This other archaeology purports to free objects from the onus of having
to signify, to function, to be accessible or available. It cherishes the
duplicity of archaeological objects: their moments of decontextualization
and recontextualization. In being dug out and ripped from its matrix,
the old object holds the potential of producing the effect of the new,
by virtue of its very remoteness and alterity, its singularity. The
process, the duplicity, is one of estrangement, re-collection, recovery.

Three Modern Archaeological Moments
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
1. April or May 1896: An Archaeology of the Psyche
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
In a letter to Stefan Zweig in 1931, Sigmund Freud complains, or brags,
"I have sacrificed a great deal for my collection of Greek, Roman and
Egyptian antiquities, [and] have actually read more archaeology than
psychology."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The obsessive nature of Freud's antiquity collecting is well
documented. In Edmund Engelman's famous photographs of the study at
Berggasse 19, glowering masks dangle precariously over archaic gods
huddled cheek by jowl on every available surface.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
H. D. describes her first reaction to the doctor's examining room as
speechless amazement before the wealth of collectibles: "Sigmund Freud
does not speak. He is waiting for me to say something. I cannot speak. I
look around the room. . . . Pricelessly lovely objects are displayed
here on the shelves to right, to left of me. . . . no one had told me
that this room was lined with treasures."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Freud's personal physician relates that Freud called his collecting
"an addiction second in intensity only to his nicotine addiction."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
But Freud's interest in archaeological artifacts is not manifest
simply in a mania for rines. Although his confession to Zweig may
well be exaggerated, his lifelong fascination with archaeology was
systematic enough to call for a library of archaeological treatises
running to hundreds of titles and to undergird a close friendship
with Emanuel L&#x000F6;wy, recently rediscovered as a "forgotten pioneer"
in archaeological research.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Underlying this scientific curiosity is a personal enthrallment to the
re of Heinrich Schliemann: as early as 1899, Freud writes Wilhelm
Fliess of his envy for the discoverer of Troy, whose archaeological
motivations he ascribes to childhood dreams as vivid as his own early
love for Rome: "happiness comes only with the fulfillment of a childhood
wish. This reminds me that I shall not go to Italy this year."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
Even before this avowal of personal idolatry, Freud had introduced
archaeology as a methodological correlate to his developing theories of
therapeutic psychology. "The Aetiology of Hysteria" (<i>Zur &#x000C4;tiologie
der Hysterie</i>), first presented as a lecture to the Viennese "Verein
f&#x000FC;r Psychiatrie und Neurologie" in April or May 1896,
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
opens with a justification for Freud and Breuer's approach based
on comparison to excavation&#x02014;an "advance" in archaeological
technique. Freud turns from the patient's autobiographical
self-assessment to the analyst's clinical discovery by invoking
the switch in authority from history to material culture that Gavin
Lucas limns in this issue. An explorer happening upon some ruins may,
Freud suggests, simply ask the locals ("perhaps semi-barbaric people")
to divulge any indigenous traditions concerning their history. "But
he may act differently. . . . he may start upon the ruins, clear
away the rubbish, and, beginning from the visible remains, uncover
what is buried." If he is successful, the unearthed artifacts will
"yield undreamed-of information about the events of the remote
past. . . . <i>Saxa loquuntur!</i>"
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
For one archaeological tradition, stones speak about their history. For
the excavatory analyst, hysterical symptoms are eloquent about their
traumatic causes.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Both authorities, we might add, will exhibit a similar tendency towards
collection and display of the curiosities they expose.


<b></b>


<p>
As with so many things Freudian, the systematic role of archaeology
in Freud's work has been the subject of controversy in the past twenty
years. While Peter Gay is willing to term it "a master metaphor for his
life's work,"
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Donald Spence finds its implied positivism inadequate to the "anecdotal
rather than archival" nature of the "so-called data" of psychoanalysis,
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
to which Donald Kuspit responds that, on the contrary, psychoanalysis
achieves its hermeneutic goals even more successfully than archaeology.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Freud's use of the metaphor is inscribed in a synthetic discussion of
the relation of archaeological practice to modernist thought by Julian
Thomas in his essay in this issue.
<p>
The complexity of critical reaction may simply reflect Freud's own
equivocations: the archaeological metaphor appears at odd intervals
throughout his writing&#x02014;in case studies: Dora, the Wolfman,
the Rat Man; in the analysis of Wilhelm Jensen's archaeological fable
<i>Gradiva</i>&#x02014;subject in each case to varying qualifications
and stipulations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
In its final evocation, in a late paper on technique, "Constructions
in Analysis" (<i>Konstruktionen in der Analyse</i> [1937]), the exact
equivalence of archaeology and psychoanalysis&#x02014;"the two processes
are in fact identical"&#x02014;is almost immediately negated by the
caveat that "the analyst works under better conditions . . . since
what he is dealing with is not something destroyed but something that
is still alive."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
The distinction here echoes the avant-garde critique of archaeological
pass&#x000E9;ism.
<p>
The complexity of the comparison between archaeology and psychoanalysis is
not lost on Freud. He finds a means of redeploying facets of archaeology
for the modern aspirations of a science of the psyche. The analogy
recruits not just the depth model of excavation, but other aspects
of archaeological practice: its stratigraphic mapping of temporality
onto spatial relations; its conscription of fragmentary evidence into a
causal narrative. Freud compares the layers of the psyche to those of
an archaeological dig, "and if an object makes its appearance in some
particular level, it often remains to be decided whether it belongs to
that level or whether it was carried down to that level owing to some
subsequent disturbance."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
And the broken objects found in this stratigraphic psyche, like the
"priceless though mutilated relics of antiquity" to which he compares
them,
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
must be reassembled to produce their meaning. It is
this&#x02014;crucially&#x02014;that distinguishes the archaeology of
the psyche. The biographical event is redescribed as a psychic
object whose causes and effects can be reconstructed only ex post
facto by the patient analyst, who dusts them off and interprets them
in relation to the other shards buried in the ruins of the psychic
landscape. Like Freud's rines, like his speaking stones, the psychic
object&#x02014;defamiliarized but uncannily at home&#x02014;most strikingly
links psychoanalysis and archaeology: disciplines concerned with objects
recognizable enough to inspire the reconstruction of their narrative,
but remote enough to be accessible only through the ministrations of
an expert.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
2. July 1926: "Archaeologisms"
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Th&#x000E9;ophile Homelle, the director of the dig at Delphi, announced
as early as 1895, "Primitive forms of art now take pride of place in
archaeological research," and gushed that archaic sculpture "has the
beauty of a half-opened flower, keeping still hidden and intact its
glory and its perfume."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
But it was not a premonitory whiff of the aesthetics


<b></b>


of classical Greece that modern art found most salutary in archaic
archaeology. If the primitivism of the early years of the century relies
on the trappings of cultures far-flung in space&#x02014;African masks and
Tahitian maidens&#x02014;it avails itself equally of the remnants of far-off
times, furnished by an archaeology moving beyond Winckelmannian classicism
and hellenism, a move whose specific implications for Greek modernism are
outlined by Gregory Jusdanis in this issue. But Picasso's Iberian heads
and Le Corbusier's polychromed Moschophorous are not reference points
along a scientifically established timeline, but end-runs around the
inevitability of archaeological chronology: before and outside history,
so temporally distant as to escape the taint of historicism&#x02014;and
thereby ripe for exploitation by modernism.
<p>
So it is when Christian Zervos founds the journal <i>Cahiers d'art</i>
in 1926. Subtitling the publication "Revue d'actualit&#x000E9; artistique"
(Review of artistic contemporaneity), Zervos underlines its commitment to
the latest and most cutting-edge artistic production. The <i>Cahiers</i>
showcase the cream of the avant-garde crop: Braque, Gris, L&#x000E9;ger,
Matisse. Above all, they champion Picasso, Zervos's particular favorite,
whose work he would present in a thirty-three-volume catalogue
raisonn&#x000E9; beginning in 1932.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
But Zervos's insistence on the modernity of contemporary art goes hand
in hand with a presentation of the archaeological object in the power
of its alterity. Implicitly reframed by juxtaposition with cubist
painting and International architecture, the artifacts unearthed in
archaeological excavation shake off their dust and present a brave
new face to the world. From the first issues, the <i>Cahiers</i> ran
articles on Cycladic rines and Cretan faience, on Etruscan mural
painting and Mesopotamian pottery. For some contributors, the importance
of this material lay in its crystallization of an untainted originary
moment in human existence: Hans M&#x000FC;hlestein devotes a five-part
investigation to "The Origins of Art and Culture" in the <i>Cahiers</i>
for 1930, which is introduced with an explicit call for a "return to the
source." "Whoever has a true interest in art cannot be satisfied with
the doctrines inspired by classicism, which rest only on a derivative
conception of an anterior state where instinct plays the most active
role. They are only a consequence: we must go back to the origin."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The implicit substitution of a good archaic history for a degenerate
classical one may just replicate a shifting archaeological
chronology. More radical is the gesture Zervos himself advocates:
wrenching objects out of their context so that the journal becomes
the forum for encounters between the past and the present, "in order
to show the unity of the human spirit under its surface complexity,
and the modernity of the great works of the past."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
It is in this spirit that Zervos enlists Georges-Henri
Rivi&#x000E8;re, student at the &#x000C9;cole du Louvre and sometime
contributor to the <i>Cahiers,</i> to kick off a series presenting
archaeological finds&#x02014;an ongoing set of avant-garde field
reports&#x02014;with a manifesto of sorts in seventh issue of the
journal. "Arch&#x000E9;ologismes," presented in extenso in the dossier
hereto, hits the high notes of vanguard-approved archaeology: not
classical but archaic; not European but world-wide; not museified but
site-specific. "Parricide daughter of humanism," archaeology is its own
worst enemy, toppling the museums it seeks to feed and revealing life
where it sought to document history. At the same time, Rivi&#x000E8;re
lauds the fruitful archaeological dig and hardnosed archaeological
rigor. Archaeology


<b></b>


shows us, not the course of civilization, but the force of the
object&#x02014;modern and ancient are equal; Minos, divested of his
legends, reclaims his palaces, their treasures, their frescos. (Arthur
Evans, the excavator of Minoan Knossos, certainly colluded in wresting
his archaeological finds from a detached and prehistoric past with his
modernist reconstructions of the site and its society&#x02014;they appear
distinctively contemporary.) In a warning sadly unheeded by many of his
colleagues, Rivi&#x000E8;re concludes, "those who expect to return to
the source will find fog . . ."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
In Rivi&#x000E8;re's series, ceramics from Knossos and sculptures
from China rub shoulders with etchings by Braque and paintings by
L&#x000E9;ger. It is not long before his presentations move from print
to museum, as his archaeologisms lead him to organize a celebrated
exhibit of the American Indian collections at the Trocad&#x000E9;ro in
1928 and from there to a career in museological innovation, showcasing
archaeological objects for their artistic and cultural creativity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
This archaeology is no longer metaphorical but utilitarian, a machine
for producing objects whose alterity undergirds revolution.

Interlude. 1937: The End of History
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
"Be that as it may, history has ended."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
When Alexandre Koj&#x000E8;ve explicated Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of the
Spirit</i> to the Parisian intellectual elite between 1933 and 1939,
history became no longer a set of stuffy traditions to be violently
abandoned. It was done, finished, reduced to a few posthumous spasms and
an internecine debate over whether Napol&#x000E9;on or Stalin was its last
avatar. Georges Bataille, whose archaeological interests are discussed
by Carrie Noland in these pages, writes Koj&#x000E8;ve in 1937 in bemused
agreement with his analysis: "I grant (as a likely supposition) that
from now on history is ended (except for the denouement)."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
It is during this denouement that an irregular attendee of Bataille's
experimental "Coll&#x000E8;ge de sociologie," Walter Benjamin, was hunched
over a reading desk in the Biblioth&#x000E8;que nationale, assembling
material for his monumental <i>Arcades Project</i>. The debris of history
surveyed by Benjamin's rearguard angel is exhaustingly exhumed and laid
out in this accumulation of historical objects, which consistently
seeks to "blast the continuity of history." What Jens Malte Fischer
has called an "archaeology of bourgeois interiors"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
finds its justification in resisting the subsumption of those objects
into narration.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In fact, an object of history cannot be targeted at all within the
continuous elapse of history. And so, from time immemorial, historical
narration has simply picked out an object from this continuous
succession. But it has done so without foundation, as an expedient;
and its first thought was then always to reinsert the object into the
continuum, which it would create anew through empathy. Materialist
historiography does not choose its objects arbitrarily. It does not
fasten on them but rather springs them loose from the order of succession.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If the historical continuity implied by some archaeology is rewritten
as ontogeny by Freud and repudiated as oppressive by the avant-gardes,
its end, or explosion, will require a new relationship to its objects. The
unfinished heap of material making up the <i>Arcades Project</i> suggests
the hazards of such an undertaking.

3. 1961: The Archaeology of That Silence
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
The award for the most extensive use of the term archaeology to describe
humanistic undertaking goes, of course, to Michel Foucault. Yet when
Foucault invokes archaeology in the preface to the first edition of
<i>Folie et d&#x000E9;raison</i> (Madness and Civilization), it is easy
to gloss over the reference as unremarkable. Bemoaning the silencing of
madness by its constitution as a mental illness, Foucault counters with
his plans for recovery. "The language of psychiatry, which is a monologue
of reason about madness, has been established only on the basis of such
a silence. / I have not tried to write the history of that language,
but rather the archaeology of that silence."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The inspiration here seems still to be a metaphorics of
excavation&#x02014;a silence buried under layers of reason's chatter
yearns only to be unearthed so that, like Freud's stones, it too might
speak. As a philosophical gesture, it repeats the same distracted wave
of the hand with which Jean Cavaill&#x000E8;s treats phenomenology as
an archaeology&#x02014;for its depth model of epistemology.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The same appears to be the case when Foucault subtitles <i>Birth of
the Clinic</i> "an archaeology of medical perception [<i>regard</i>],"
although here perhaps the flavor of rigorous scientific inquiry into
the past is added to the mix as well. As it turns out, though, these
archaeologies contain seeds of a complexity only hinted at by their
initial uses.
<p>
What it all adds up to, we learn in <i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i>,
is the redescription in terms of topology and stratigraphy of what used to
belong to chronology. "There was a time when archaeology, as a discipline
devoted to silent monuments, inert traces, objects without context,
and things left by the past, aspired to the condition of history, and
attained meaning only through the restitution of a historical discourse;
it might be said, to play on words a little, that in our time history
aspires to the condition of archaeology, to the intrinsic description
of the monument."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Foucault's archaeology provides a description of discourses in their
positivity, just as Rivi&#x000E8;re's provides a description of Minoan
palaces without their legends. At the end of history&#x02014;here, history
as the story of the subject <i>man</i>&#x02014;it is ironically archaeology
that, stripped of its narrativizing propensities, can once again serve
to describe the past. That Foucault precisely rejects the depth model
of interpretation that archaeological excavation would seem to invite,
and indeed repudiates the very notion of object, serves only to show
the many points of contact between a multifaceted archaeology and the
complex variegations of modern epistemology.

&#x02014;An Archaeological Glossary
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have outlined what may be called the duplicity of the archaeological
object and have tracked aspects of some archaeological modernisms
that work upon this duplicity, playing the fragment against context in
relation to epistemology, temporality and emancipation. We will amplify
our illustration of three archaeological moments with a glossary. Many
of the terms here are tropes&#x02014;in particular, narrative scenarios,
character types and metaphors.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<!--_c-head-->
surfaces&#x02014;depths
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The archaeological matrix, sometimes called the archaeological record,
is considered as an amalgam of layers. The concept of stratigraphy is
used to decode this amalgam.
<p>
In this decoding, the archaeologist digs down to find meaning. But digging
stratigraphically is impossible without the concept of horizontal surface
interface&#x02014;edges, moments of discontinuity when one layer becomes
another. The establishment of such surface discontinuity is the focus
of much archaeological excavation. And, of course, it involves sideways
movement across a surface, planning features such as walls and pits,
as one goes.
<p>
This is not simply to map the spatial coordinates of a 3-D
matrix&#x02014;the phases perhaps of a ruined building. There is no
comprehensible past down there to be discovered in some kind of 3-D
form&#x02014;for archaeology depends upon tying layers to date (there
is no innate chronology to sediment), choices of what to distinguish,
upon defining the interfaces between and across layers. The concept
of interface is thus a <i>supplement</i> to the stratigraphy&#x02014;an
immaterial concept external to layering, but essential to it.

<i>
<!--_c-head-->
origins&#x02014;continuity
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Much archaeology is a quest for contemporary origins (this is where and
when we come from) and is thus premised upon a continuity between past
and present.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
(dis)continuity&#x02014;shock
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Of course there is a particular and material continuity that lends
extraordinary force to notions of geneaological continuity&#x02014;the
materiality of the past has survived, ruined and decayed, but nevertheless
present to the archaeologist.
<p>
The materiality of loss, however, the experience that so much is gone,
that so little remains as inheritance, is simultaneously the ground
for radical discontinuity. The implications are threefold. First: The
waste and loss that may be the real story of history means that ideas of
sociocultural continuity (of community, identity, technology, progress)
may be quite literally groundless. Second: The fragments of history
attest to massive lacunae, and assembling the pieces as a narrative can
only occur locally, if at all. Third: Radical historical discontinuity
throws suspicion on accounts and narratives that depend upon notions of
sociocultural and biological similarity that transcend history (notions,
for example, of universal human values). Radical discontinuity may thus
mean a shock of radical difference.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
difference&#x02014;primitivism
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Evolutionary schemes play upon a past that is different from the present
in being at an earlier, more primitive stage. Here discontinuity is
explicitly and intimately tied to grand metanarratives of historical
contintuity.

<!--_c-head-->
authenticity&#x02014;aura
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Depth and origin are often equated with authenticity.
<p>
An authentic artifact may be considered to possess aura. And aura,
of course, may involve a sense of distance and difference.
<p>
The grounds for authenticity and aura are material&#x02014;the piece of
the past has survived and its materiality is witness to this survival,
its metonymical bridging of time and making good of loss.

<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The material past is encountered unspoken, and is ultimately ineffable
(but see mute-ability). Here is a profound question that can only be
resolved as fatally flawed translation&#x02014;how are we to document
the past on the basis of its fragmentary material remains? We can only
interminably scribble on the ruins which always hold back more than ever
could be said or pictured.
<p>
Encountering the archaeological past is distinctively
sensory&#x02014;embodied. Just like memory, we feel as much as rationally
decode the past. This is associated with its ineffability&#x02014;it is
often <i>only</i> felt. Reactions may range from fascination through
disgust to veneration of the sacred.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
the fieldworker

</i>

<p>
Engages with archaeological places, and decontextualizes site and
artifact, rips them from their setting, for there are only ever fragments,
and choices must be made, of what elicits attention, of what to record,
of what to conserve.

<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Ruins in the land&#x02014;this is one of the sites of archaeology. It may
be conceived as "the field."
<p>
Sites may be represented as coordinates&#x02014;spatial grid reference. They
may be described topographically. More accurately, and with Michel Serres,
their representation requires a <i>topology</i> that can deal with
the palimpsest that is landscape&#x02014;the percolating time that folds
together the many fragmentary traces of pasts present in any one place.

<p>
The archaeologist faces a mound of debris. One way of making good the loss
inherent in the fragment is to define categories and classify. Writing
catalogs.
<p>
Or, in choosing a systematics that eschews the construction of a coherent
historical narrative (inadequately based upon scattered archaeological
fragments), archaeologists may instead approximate an artifactual
cladistics.

<p>
The loss that is at the heart of the archaeological project&#x02014;history
as ruin&#x02014;is a precisely modernist experience of the twentieth
century. How can we hold on to the mass of information and detail,
the lives descending into chaos?

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
horror&#x02014;abjection
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
There is horror not only in the metamorphic processes of decay
that apply to our own materiality. But also in the entropy that is
history&#x02014;the tendency to misunderstand (so much is missing), the
drift into formlessness. Then there is the sickening loss that is the
horror of history&#x02014;the wasted lives. So much thrown away.
<p>
A forensic horror too, as at the scene of a crime&#x02014;the chance find
of a finger bone or tooth (or, so often now, the mass grave of anonymous
victims) attesting to . . .

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
symptomatic logic&#x02014;forensics
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
At a scene of crime anything might be relevant. The archaeological site
is cognate with the crime scene. The tiny fragment may be significant
and provide a clue to some deeper meaning or knowledge. The fragment or
trace is here conceived as a kind of clue or symptom.


<b></b>


<p>
In a symptomatic logic superficial and isolated finds, events and
observations are linked to underlying process. A symptom may lead to
medical diagnosis. An archaeological find may track the migration of an
ethnic group.

<p>
The desire is for some kind of control over the incidental details,
a system that might lead to identification. Just as Francis Galton and
Alphonse Bertillon, and a nineteenth-century will to knowledge, codified
and cataloged fingerprints and ears, the shape of eyebrows in a forensic
anthropology, a physiognomic science of character, race and conformity,
so too did, do, archaeologists collect skulls and flint tools, measuring
and comparing in a systematization of ancient race and cultural industry.

<i>
<!--_c-head-->
the collector
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Recontextualizing fragments. The collection is always more than an
account of the past and more than the sum of its parts. It is rooted in
heterogeneous association. The collector is fascinated by the life of
an artifact&#x02014;its journey through making, use, discard, recovery,
re-collection.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
re-collection
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
It is not only that archaeologists gather fragments and
build collections. Like memory, the work of archaeology is
re-collection&#x02014;the reinsertion of pieces of the past into a form
that carries significance in the present, carried forward from the
past. As in memory, the (archaeological) traces of the past do not
constitute a timeline or linear account. They resonate with a present
experienced moment; this is what precipitates their reemergence, their
recollection. This is actuality.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
absence and negativity
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
It is not that the archaeological past is absent. It is more precisely
not present. Or, we might say the trace means the past is absent in its
presence. Archaeology is a dynamic of presence and absence.
<p>
In this dynamic, all historical culture is residual. There is a negativity
represented by the loss of the past, its absence. This negativity is
the only condition for knowledge of the past&#x02014;waste and garbage
are the condition of historical insight and knowledge.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
agent and artifact
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
What is the distinction between the history of human agents and the
history of material traces? Between people and tools? People and artifacts
have, we may say, been intertwined for as long as there have been modern
humans. We have always been cyborgs, material agents, embodied agents,
materially located agents, people conceivable as things, artifacts
playing active roles in society and history.


<b></b>


<p>
Material culture, the subject of archaeology and a new interdisciplinary
field (material culture studies) that also includes anthropology,
sociology, economics, design, and art history, is thus something of
a tautology&#x02014;because human history (of culture) has always been
material, in the social fabric, in the materiality of human agents.
<p>
Archaeology thus, potentially, merges with natural history, as it did in
its antiquarian beginnings, as chorography mingled topography with writing
on nature, with speculation on field monuments, with philological focus
upon place names, with an interest in old things found, in the animal
and plant species of a landscape.
<p>
To what extent is the individual agent lost in the tide of history? Is
archaeology best understood as the evolution of species of tools? Are
overarching structures (social, cultural, biological) the real subject
of deep human time?

New Archaeological Histories
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have histories of published ideas in archaeology, and histories of
class determination in the creation of archaeological knowledges. One
of the aims of this collection is to contribute to a new history of
archaeological dispositions, of the forms of a cultural imaginary centered
upon traces of the past in the present, their metamorphoses in the
interests of modernists and antiquarians, the fears and gratifications.
<p>
Another goal of this special issue is to show that despite modernist
critique of antiquarianism, the connections between modern culture and
archaeology are multiple and productive. The twin poles of association
evoked by Duchamp's shovel&#x02014;a metaphorics of embodied excavation
and a turn to the accumulated, to the object&#x02014;resonate powerfully
with modernist thought. Between&#x02014;and beyond&#x02014;these poles lies a
complex of notions: archaism and primitivism, topography, stratigraphy,
cladistics, that speaks to the richness of this encounter. What follows
is an attempt to begin a discussion between archaeologists and humanists
about the vectors of its continuation.

Towards the end of 1933, five of the leading champions of the modern
movement in Italian architecture&#x02014;the engineer Gaetano Ciocca and his
young partners and followers, the members of the architectural firm Banfi,
Belgioioso, Peressutti, and Rogers&#x02014;presented a "totalitarian" city
plan for the northern city of Pavia within the framework of a contentious
and highly publicized competition. Their comprehensive city plan was
meant to crystallize what fascist modernists thought to be the core
values of Mussolini's corporativist revolution and represented a gesture
of defiance addressed to the piecemeal approaches to urban planning that
informed rival proposals put forth by traditional urbanists. Whereas the
latter sought gradual, incremental solutions to the problems created
by the city's burgeoning economy, solutions that extended and built
upon Pavia's long history as a regional capital and urban center,
the Ciocca/BBPR plan proposed a clean break. Through an ambitious
program of demolition and new construction, it sought to transform
Pavia into a model city, rigorously laid out according to the criteria
of rationalism and functionalism, as recently articulated by the likes
of Le Corbusier, Ernst May, and Walter Gropius at the Athens meeting of
the International Congress for Modern Architecture (CIAM). Yet&#x02014;here
lies the apparent (but only <i>apparent</i>) paradox with which this essay
will concern itself&#x02014;the Ciocca/BBPR Pavia plan promised to effect
this transformation while renewing the city's ancient Roman origins. In
both the formal proposal known as the <i>Relazione</i> and a subsequent
exhibition dedicated to corporativist urbanism held at the Galleria del
Milione in Milan in early 1934, the plan was framed by a quote from Titus
Livy: <small>NUNC IN CORPUS UNUM CONFUSI OMNES</small> (all are united


<b></b>


now in a single body)&#x02014;a quotation from book 34 of the <i>History
of Rome</i> in which Caesar's work as an empire builder and urban planner
is evoked within the context of a broader discussion of Cato the Elder's
Spanish campaign of 195 <small>B.C.</small> (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
How to reconcile the modernist setting with the ancient text, the
talk of a clean break with the promise to renew ancient origins,
Roman bodily metaphors with fascist corporativism? This brief essay
will answer these questions by teasing out how the passage from Livy
stitches together the rhetorical horizons of the Ciocca/BBPR project. For
the radical rupture with Pavia's immediate past promised by the city
plan is linked by its authors to the restoration of a martial past
identified with Hannibal's vanquisher and the legendary founder of
the city, Publius Cornelius Scipio. Scipio, Cato, Caesar: such is the
triumvirate that is made to sustain the claim made not only by Ciocca
and BBPR, but also, in a broader and less explicit sense, by many other
leading proponents of the new architecture both inside and outside of
Italy, that rationalism and functionalism may be the foundation stones
of a new international style, but that they are, nonetheless, profound
expressions of an originary moment within Mediterranean culture. Whether
the moment in question is Roman, Etruscan, or Minoan, or whether it is
associated instead with the Mediterranean's vernacular architectures,
matters less than the conviction that the city of the future coincides
with the city of a prelapsarian remote past. The avant-garde's degree
zero of representation and construction, its revolt against merely
ornamental forms of historicism, its blank slates and utopic grids,
close the door on antiquity only to reopen it once again in the mode of
an archaeology of archaic structures. It is thus not by accident that in
his 1923 <i>Towards a New Architecture,</i> Le Corbusier placed the lesson
of Pompeii at the center of his plea for an architecture of engineers:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Pompeii must be seen, appealing in its rectangular plan. They [the
Romans] had conquered Greece and, like good barbarians, they found the
Corinthian order more beautiful than the Doric, because it was more
ornate. On then with the acanthus capitals, and entablatures decorated
with little discretion or taste! But underneath this there was something
Roman, as we shall see. Briefly, they constructed superb chassis, but
they designed deplorable coachwork rather like the landaus of Louis XIV.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Pompeii's "truth" is the naked rectangle, the elementary structure,
the chassis without coachwork (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). The lesson
of Pavia will take the argument one step further: namely, that there
exists a distinctively avant-gardist antiquarianism, intimately linked
to scientific archaeology, that strips away the dense foliage of acanthus
leaves so that, instead of imitating the past, it can make it new.
<p>
Before addressing the particulars of the Ciocca/BBPR Pavia plan,
the passage from Livy and the larger narrative within which it is
embedded in the <i>Relazione</i> invites some comment. Book 34 of Livy's
<i>History</i> begins by recounting Cato the Elder's campaign against the
repeal of the <i>Lex Oppia:</i> the set of emergency measures decreed
in 215 <small>B.C.</small> after Rome's defeat at Cannae, prohibiting
women from wearing multicolored garments and ostentatious gold jewelry,
as well as from being driven in carriages within and around the immediate
periphery of cities, except on the occasion of religious festivals.

<br /><br />
Six years after Hannibal's definitive defeat (in 195 <small>B.C.</small>),
a generalized revolt broke out against these restrictions and triumphed,
despite the impassioned opposition of Cato, for whom Livy devises a
windy and only mildly sympathetic speech championing the moral austerity
of yore. For Cato, the <i>Lex Oppia</i> represents a bulwark against
licentiousness, the disorderly circulation of persons, the mixing of
social classes, excesses of female luxury, the loss of authority, the
emasculation of men: in short, all of those "oriental" and "African"
attributes that rendered once disciplined Rome vulnerable to the assault
of a Carthaginian general. Following his defeat on this pressing issue
of public morality and order, and the law's repeal, Cato sets about
continuing the work of bringing peace through war to the very country
from which, decades before, Hannibal had set out toward Rome: namely,
Spain. He embarks on a sea voyage and arrives with a small army in the
coastal city of Emporiae (Ampurias) and there encounters a partitioned
city, divided up between Spaniards and Greeks, each side diffident and
fiercely vigilant with regard to the other. In the end, Cato scatters
and vanquishes the Spaniards by means of an action that, Livy implies,
anticipates subsequent actions performed by Julius Caesar. The full
passage reads:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Roman colonists later formed a third class of inhabitants [alongside the
Spaniards and the Greeks]; these were added by the divine Caesar after
the final defeat of Pompey's sons, and <i>at the present time all the
inhabitants have been amalgamated into one body</i>, after the granting
of Roman citizenship, first to the Spaniards and finally to the Greeks
[<i>nunc in corpus unum confusi omnes Hispanis prius, postremo et Graecis
in civitatem Romanam adscitis</i>].
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The single body politic prered by Cato's conquest of the enemy and
fulfilled through Julius's amalgamation of the city's three districts
subjects the unruly Spaniards and Greeks to Roman discipline and Roman
law. And this triumph of discipline and law is why the <i>con-fusio</i>
of personshere doesn't imply precisely the sort of social disarray and
unruly circulation that Cato feared would result in the wake of the
revocation of the Oppian laws.
<p>
There are many echoes of Livy's tale in the Ciocca/BBPR report,
particularly in the second chapter, devoted to the city's history. Pavia
is described, like Ampurias, as a tripartite city, divided into three
areas&#x02014;<i>Pavia vecchia</i>, <i>Pavia ampliata</i>, and <i>Pavia
nuova;</i> three areas that, despite the rigorous logic of a still visible
Roman city plan, have become segregated from one another over the course
of the city's two millennia of history. But the deeper connection is to
Hannibal's true opponents, the patrician family of the Scipios, to whose
second great patriarch, Publius Cornelius Scipio, the <i>Relazione</i>
attributes the foundation of Pavia along the banks of the River Ticino:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We should like to imagine that Pavia was established in the Roman year
535 by Publius Cornelius Scipio when, having fully armed Piacenza, he
set out to thwart the advance of Hannibal. Rome was never wont to await
the enemy behind its lines of defense, nor can there be any doubt that
the army of the consul was burning with desire to face an enemy on an
open battlefield that had eluded it by fleeing along the Rodano river
the prior month. [<i>R,</i> 3]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>

The fortified camp or <i>castrum</i> that would later become Pavia was
established, in other words, at the time of Publius Cornelius's skirmishes
with Hannibal in the Ticino/Rodano region. After Hannibal's defeat of
Publius in 218 <small>B.C.</small> that fortified camp would be reoccupied
and built up along the lines of the original city plan&#x02014;less a
"plan" in the modern sense than a series of rudimentary square-shaped
furrows&#x02014;by Scipio Africanus Major, Publius's son and Hannibal's
definitive vanquisher. The ties between Ampurias and Cato to Pavia and the
Scipios may be complex. But the authors' intent is clear: to establish
Pavia's martial foundations, to enfold these foundations within a
genealogy of powerful Roman patriarchs, to associate the city with ancient
Roman law and moral rigor, and to oppose it from the very moment of its
foundation to barbarism, effeminacy, and orientalism. The totalitarian
Ciocca/BBPR city plan will give rise to a future Pavia in harmony with
and indeed <i>literally based upon</i> the simple geometries of Pavia's
now buried Roman origins. And it effects this recovery not by awaiting
behind its own lines the assault of modernity's foes, but by seeking
them out on the open battlefield of public opinion and competitions.
<p>
So the story of the Scipios looms large in chapter two's attempt to
account for why "the spirit of Pavia has, throughout the centuries,
been a warrior spirit, its shield the shield of soldiers: that of faith
and sacrifice . . ." (<i>R,</i> 3). But this still doesn't address the
question of why a quote from Livy appears at the report's beginning and
end. Why its presence on every one of the photomontage panels placed on
display at the Galleria del Milione? The answer, I believe, lies in the
realm of political metaphorics. To put it simply, Ciocca and BBPR read
the word <i>corporativist</i> (not <i>corpus</i>)into Livy's <i>nunc
in corpus unum confusi omnes</i>. They deliberately fascistized the
Roman historian's text in order to advance the causes both of fascist
corporativism and of rationalist architecture as the true interpretation
of fascism's corporativist revolution.
<p>
The years 1933-1935 marked something of a turning point with respect
to Mussolini's promised transformation of the relation between the
economy and the state. The experiment had commenced in 1930 with the
creation of seven national "guilds" or "corporations"&#x02014;the Italian
word <i>corporazione</i> means both&#x02014;representing agriculture,
commerce, industry, banking, navigation, transportation, and the
professions, coupled together at the level of a national council
responsible for coordinating their policies and harmonizing them with
national priorities, as set by the central government. Twenty-two such
entities would eventually come into being. But the forced incorporation
of representatives from labor and capital within self-governing organs
was never truly brought to term because of resistance on the part of
entrenched institutional interests and industrialists. The Corporations
were eventually reduced to empty shells and denied genuine clout
vis-&#x000E0;-vis industry and genuine independence with respect to
the state. In short, the experiment was already starting to run into
trouble by the time of the 1933 Pavia competition. True believers,
so-called "left-wing" fascists like Gaetano Ciocca, were battling the
"conservative" opposition by championing a radical and integral approach
to corporativism which, Ciocca and company argued&#x02014;to the delight
of the cultural arri&#x000E8;re-garde, among whom corporativist skeptics
abounded&#x02014;was the necessary ideological counterpart to the new
architecture and urbanism.


<b></b>


<p>
In a forthcoming book devoted to Ciocca, entitled <i>Building
Fascism/Communism/Democracy</i>, I have spelled out at length the
engineer's view (shared with other "integral corporativists" like Ugo
Spirito) that corporativism represented a third way to modernization
combining the best of capitalism and socialism, individualism and
collectivism, within the framework of a belief system committed to
endowing "mere" economic reason with a higher, more spiritual logic.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
So I will not rehearse the argument here. But it is surely worth noting
that neither Ciocca's devotion to corporativism nor his advocacy of
an avant-gardist understanding of <i>romanitas</i> were matters of
opportunism. On the contrary, in the course of the fascist decades this
now forgotten but extraordinary engineer emerged as a major interpreter
of corporativist doctrine in the domain of architecture and technics,
and as a key mediator between fascist Italy, the Soviet Union, and the
United States. Author of <i>Giudizio sul bolscevismo</i> (Judgment on
bolshevism), <i>Economia di massa</i> (The mass economy), and <i>La
strada guidata</i> (The guided roadway); chief engineer for the enormous
RIV ball-bearing plant that was a centerpiece of Stalin's Five-Year Plan
and of Fiat's effort to displace Ford in the Soviet marketplace; inventor
of the "fast house" (<i>casa rapida</i>) and of the "guided roadway"
(<i>strada guidata</i>); the Ciocca of the 1930s and 1940s dedicated
himself with passion and selfless devotion to building a corporativist
society through technical innovation. His mass theater projects answered
Mussolini's call for the creation of facilities that could house a new
fascist theater of the masses for the masses by devising a coliseum-like
mass-spectacle factory much like those he had seen firsthand in the
Soviet Union. His experiments in the field of social housing involved
industrially mass-produced, prefabricated, rationalist peasant and worker
homes bolder and more ingenious in design than those of many far more
renowned architects. His ventures into animal husbandry, defined by one
critic as an effort to build a sort of modernist Grand Hotel for pigs,
brought to the agrarian world the same zeal for rationalization that
he applied to the design of corporativist city plans, fast houses,
fortresses (<i>fortini</i>), and mass theaters. Last but not least, he
labored to bring about the construction of a nationwide transportation
system of self-steering vehicles on guided roadways&#x02014;a "rational"
system that would reconcile the need for mass transit with private
circulation, the collectivity with the individual&#x02014;a fascist third
way but in the domain of transportation.
<p>
After a life of only modest prominence working as a builder and
transportation engineer in Milan and Turin, Ciocca was suddenly
skyrocketed to fame in 1933, thanks to a rave review of <i>Judgment on
Bolshevism</i> that appeared anonymously in a September issue of <i>Il
Popolo d'Italia,</i> the more or less official daily of the National
Fascist Party.
<p>
A number of stylistic tics betrayed the secret that its author was
Mussolini. The review was immediately recycled as a first preface to the
second edition of Ciocca's book, now paired with the original preface by
Pietro Maria Bardi, one of the modern movement's leading champions and
impresarios. At the time of the Pavia competition, the engineer was a good
twenty years the senior of his partners, who were under twenty-five at
the time, and there can be little doubt&#x02014;judging from seniority,
content, style, and the manuscript tradition&#x02014;that he was the
principal author of the <i>Relazione</i>. Certainly,


<b></b>


the <i>Relazione</i>'s interlacing of avant-gardist and antiquarian
themes is a recurring feature in Ciocca's writings, from <i>Judgment
on Bolshevism</i> to the <i>Discorsi sulle cose reali</i> (Discourses
on things real) published in the popular magazine <i>Tempo</i> in the
mid-1940s to his post-World War II technical writings.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Allusions to Greco-Roman literature abound. But so do claims like the
following, always made with simplicity and genuine conviction:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When geometry is applied to architecture, the latter assumes the name of
Rationalism. The Coliseum and the Roman aqueducts, to this day the most
compelling instances of Rationalist architecture, are geometry pure and
simple. The false Rationalisms that sometimes afflict us are little more
than false geometry, erroneous theorems, logical receptacles riddled with
holes. What I propose to do is to demonstrate how a strictly geometrical
method, based on a simple and clear set of norms, can resolve all the
problems . . .
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Whether the problem of the moment was social housing, pig farms, canals,
or drainage projects, Ciocca shared much the same view that was propounded
by Le Corbusier and by other Mediterraneanist modernizers, a heterogeneous
group extending from the likes of Giuseppe Terragni to literati like
Ezra Pound. For them, Roman architecture was an architecture not of
ornamentation and rhetoric but of rigorous geometries and structures,
an architecture of power and for power devoted to "good arrangement,
a single idea, daring and unity in construction, the use of elementary
shapes, a sane morality."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
That such geometries and structures had once been dressed up in painted,
ornately carved sheets of marble seemed an accident of history. "The
Romans," writes Le Corbusier with his usual aphoristic economy and gift
for hyperbole, "knew <i>nothing</i> of the use of marble" (<i>TNA,</i>
159; italics in original) (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). According
to this view, true Roman architecture consisted in naked structures
freed from decorative incrustations by the march of time. Time was on
the side of modernity, not history or tradition, whether this meant
ticking the clock back to that moment when, in the process of their
construction, ancient stone structures were complete but still free
from decorative cladding; or ticking the clock forward to 1919 when the
cult of architectural "honesty of thought and feeling" became integral
to the program of a newly founded Bauhaus.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Even in its corrosive effects, time simplified things; it reduced them
to their essential elements. Only structure and form, not ornamentation
applied as marble and/or as paint, could stand time's test. It follows
that the sound principles and austere geometries of true Roman city
planning could be renewed by accelerating time's march by means of
digs and demolitions. To strip a once ancient cityscape of modern
incrustations of architectural verbosity, bad arrangement, and confused
ideas&#x02014;incrustations always already fated to tumble into heaps of
rubble because of their faulty design&#x02014;meant to bring back to life
a city of the past that is identical to the city of the future.
<p>
Such was the spirit of the 1933 Ciocca/BBPR plan for Pavia. It sought to
apply the principles championed by the 1933 Athens meeting of the CIAM:
a functionalist approach to urban planning; the delimitation of distinct
residential, recreational, and industrial zones; the pursuit of optimal
population density and hygienic living conditions;

the integration of modern technology and mass transit into a comprehensive
overall plan; access to natural areas, recreational facilities, and
places of mass entertainment. And in so doing, it sought to transform
this regional capital into a fascist new town "laid out according to
actual functionalist particulars," consisting in subdivision of the city
into three interwoven and interconnected zones:
<b></b>


<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<i>the old city core,</i> where more than a dozen city blocks were to
be razed, refashioned, and rationalized according to a two-stage plan,
so as to form a more aesthetically pleasing and hygienic city center with
abundant green areas and space for several new buildings of value to the
public like a Palace of Corporations [<i>Palazzo delle Corporazioni</i>]
and a Ciocca-style mass theater;
<p>
<i>the expanded city,</i> where industrial plants and working class
neighborhoods would be interspersed with military zones (including
anti-aircraft defenses sheltered in a park), and where a complex of
urban vegetable gardens would be developed in the name of autarchy and
the integration of agricultural practice into the fabric of urban life;
<p>
and <i>the new city,</i> where the city's transportation links would be
used carefully to set apart, among other features, two areas designed to
"shape the perfect Italian of tomorrow": a tranquil "city of studies"
(<i>citt&#x000E0; degli studi</i>) and a brand new "city of sports and
water recreation" (<i>citt&#x000E0; balneare sportiva</i>) intended as one
of the major such centers of attraction in all of Italy. [<i>R,</i> 8-12]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The plan was prefaced by a lengthy theoretical statement, authored by
Ciocca and Rogers and subsequently published in the combative Rationalist
review <i>Quadrante,</i> defining corporativist urbanism as a response
to the disorderly and unhygienic consequences of untrammeled capitalist
urban development. It concluded by sounding the militant call for legal
reform that would become one of Ciocca's leitmotifs in the later 1930s
and the postwar:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
New laws will be necessary, laws that do not yet exist, so as to eliminate
all obstacles to the reconstruction of cities, be they of time, place or
procedure. It will be necessary to establish by law that demolitions for
reasons of hygiene should be unlimited and must take place only and as
soon as hygiene demands. Nor should the owners of properties demolished
in the interest of public hygiene be free to rebuild as they see fit on
the irregular spaces that will be freed up (because to do so would simply
perpetuate the anarchy that has resulted from the lack of planning in the
past). . . . New state construction laws need to be devised that will
help to regulate condominium maintenance fees as well as the financing
and hygiene of construction projects . . . These are the principal
difficulties that corporativism must and will overcome. <i>Nunc in corpus
unum confusi omnes</i> [All are united now in a single body]<i>.</i>
[<i>R,</i> 16]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As has already been hinted, the closing quote from Livy makes explicit
what had been anticipated in chapter two, the historical preface to
the <i>Relazione</i>, namely, that what is at stake is the recovery and
renewal of an ancient modernity that encompasses the Italian peninsula
as a whole:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If future auspices are to be derived from the history of the past,
then Pavia has a glorious destiny lying before it. Italian cities are
returning to their former state of Roman <i>castri</i> or fortresses. New
fortresses where the people constitute a militia and every citizen
has a responsibility to observe, a discipline to respect, a goal to
achieve. Roman Pavia is ready for a new war, the war that Italy prefers
and that pleases Caesar, who is at once a soldier and a farmer. [<i>R,</i>
3]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The web of references that links Cato the Elder's austere morality to the
Scipios' military prowess to the protocorporativism of Julius Caesar to
a present in which every citizen is a militiaman hints at a broader set
of equations. The old piecemeal urbanism = Africa and Carthage; the new
Rationalist urbanism = <i>romanitas</i> (correctly interpreted as the
architecture of engineers) = cities worthy of a modern corporativist
Italy united behind a twentieth-century Dux.
<p>
The Pavia city plan was submitted to local authorities in late 1933 and
roundly rejected on the grounds that the legal means were unavailable
to undertake the massive demolitions envisaged by Ciocca and BBPR. A
far more conventional and incremental city plan was adopted in its
stead. The outcome was not unexpected given that the plan involved
knocking down fully <i>one half</i> of the housing stock found within
the city walls as well as undertaking an ambitious program of new
constructions including parks, mass auditoria, and athletic arenas. But
as news of the project's defeat spread, Bardi smelled blood. He seized
the occasion to transform the project into a <i>casus belli</i> in
his battle against Italy's architectural arri&#x000E8;re-garde by doing
precisely as had been done in April 1932 to launch Alberto Sartoris's
militantly Rationalist treatise <i>Gli elementi dell'architettura</i>
(The elements of architecture): he mounted a show at the influential
Galleria del Milione with the collaboration of the gallery director,
Edoardo Persico, and the gallery owners, the Ghiringhelli brothers (<a
href="#4"> 4</a>).The show in question opened in early 1934 and,
like the Sartoris show (which had been animated by cinematographic panels
executed by Gino Ghiringhelli and Luigi ni) was built around the
ten two-meter by four-meter photomontages produced for the competition,
which were hung in the gallery, interspersed with handwritten excerpts
from the proposal and additional polemical photomontages especially
produced for the occasion. The panels were dedicated to the central
themes of the Ciocca/BBPR project and bore the titles:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I. <i>The Pavia of Yesteryear</i> (made up of different city maps from
1483 to 1724 in which "the persistence of Roman patterns" is made
apparent, flanked by a representation of how Polybius described the
city center; the Roman matrix is shown to have gradually succumbed to
"the chaotic succession of contingencies" after 1724) (<i>R,</i> 8).
<p>
II. <i>Let's Clean it Up!</i> (an "ethical and aesthetic" appeal for
a return to Pavia's ancient austerity and denunciation of the love of
dark and quaint neighborhoods with their "tubercular picturesque" beauty;
"the true crowning glory of a city is its <i>decus</i>, that utility which
translates into beauty") (<i>R,</i> 9) (<a href="#5"> 5</a>).
<p>
III. <i>The Overall Urban Layout and its Major Zones</i> (divided into
a main transportation axis and four zones devoted to university study
and recreation, military bases, farming and parks, and industry and work).
<p>
IV. <i>The City Plan</i> (the tripartite city incorporated into a single
urban corpus) (<a href="#6"> 6</a>).
<p>
V. <i>Traffic</i> (comparing current traffic flow patterns with future
ones with emphasis placed on the weak points that are remedied by the
new plan) (<a href="#7"> 7</a>).
<p>
VI . <i>The Transportation System</i> (a complete account of all the
railway, bus, car, and other linkage systems, past and future).
<p>
VII. <i>In the Name of Health and Beauty</i> (a mapping of the current and
future natural and cultural resources of the city, to be greatly expanded
thanks to the plan; a film strip cuts across the right side of the diagram
tracing an ideal itinerary through the cityscape's major monuments,
including archaeological walks; concentric circles linking bad hygienic

planning) (<a href="#8"> 8</a>).

Such fears were prompted by a wave of attacks launched by antimodernists
in newspapers like the daily <i>Il Lavoro Fascista,</i> whose commentator
suggested that the Ciocca/BBPR global conception of the "corporative
city" was fundamentally at odds with the demographic, environmental,
and historical specificity of each and every "fascist city."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>


<b></b>


Banfi and Belgioioso fired back that the distinction was pure bunk: "the
fascist city must be the functional political and aesthetic expression
of corporativist theory."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Other critics objected to the particulars of the city plan. But only
five years after the noise stirred up by the Pavia competition had died
down, Ciocca's dark spot had grown into a blot the size of the Italian
peninsula. Though its survivors would go on to become major protagonists
on the postwar architectural scene, BBPR found itself virtually
disbanded starting in 1938. Ernesto Rogers was forced into hiding due
to the promulgation of Nazi-inspired racial laws and in 1944 Banfi and
Belgioioso were shipped off to the concentration camp Mathausen-Gusen,
where Banfi died within days of the war's end. Though still prominent,
Bardi too was forced into anonymity by the end of the 1930s and in 1947
abandoned Italy for Brazil, where he became the founder and director of
the Museu de Arte de S&#x000E3;o Paulo, one of South America's leading
venues for the diffusion of modernist art, design, and architecture.
<p>
Ciocca's fortunes ebbed and flowed with the political tides. Mussolini's
rave review of <i>Judgment on Bolshevism</i> had brought him relative
prominence, but despite his access to high government circles,
he never succeeded in persuading the regime to embrace fully his
fast house designs, guided roadway systems, or mass theaters, not to
mention more eccentric projects such as Rationalist Grand Hotels for
pigs (<a href="#0"> 10</a>). By wartime the theorist of the
fascist third way had drifted out of the fascist fold, spying for the
Italo-British regional command and taking on a leading role in the
Italian Resistancebetween September 1944 and April 1945.
<p>
But the moral of the story that I have attempted to recount in these
modest reflections on a forgotten episode of the fascist culture wars
is decidedly <i>not</i> that fascist avant-gardists such as Ciocca,
Bardi, and BBPR found themselves pushed to one side as the bad
<i>romanitas</i> of the rear guard triumphed over a forward-looking
Rationalist <i>romanitas</i> in the wake of the battle of Pavia. On the
contrary, Italian state patronage practices remained varied throughout
the 1930s and the early 1940s, with major commissions being awarded to a
wide array of beneficiaries on the cultural left, center, and right. The
moral of the story, rather, has to do with a cluster of other issues: the
complexity of actual modernist practice versus theory, the eclecticism
that often lurks within or underneath otherwise purist discourses, the
battle between old historicisms and new more oblique ones during the first
half of the twentieth century, and the key role performed by archaeology
as a distinctly modern, sometimes even modernist form of urban planning
and construction. Archaeology is not, as was often assumed until the
important work of scholars such as Nikolaus Himmelmann, Alain Schnapp,
and Bruce Trigger, reducible to the art or science of recovering the past.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
For the past is always a realm of contention, a realm where retrospection
and the elaboration of prospective social fantasy are destined to
meet and merge, a realm in which not everything can be recovered
and in which recovery itself often presupposes demolition of surface
structures. Archaeology thus has little choice but to be founded upon
<i>selection</i> from among a vast array of potentially recoverable pasts
as a function of present values. Certain pasts are privileged, others
merely documented for study, others eliminated in the pursuit of deeper
beds of data. The process admits a diversity of models of discovery,

the exception but an intensification of the rule. The archaeological

It is difficult for us to imagine that archaeology is a relatively recent
discipline, whose establishment dates to the middle of the nineteenth
century. Its development has been so rapid and the interest elicited
by its discoveries so strong that it seems to be a science as ancient
as it is canonical. We should not be misled, however: if the taste for
the past, the passion for collection, the observation of the earth,
are practices as ancient as the earliest humans, archaeology in the
modern sense of the term was only constituted as an autonomous and
recognized discipline at the moment it was able to emancipate itself
from bric-a-brac, from the impossibility of dating objects and monuments
with certainty, from the barrier that separated the history of man from
the history of nature. The moment of that rupture, which transformed the
old antiquarian quest into actual archaeology, coincides with the middle
of the nineteenth century and the advent of the positive sciences. It
consists in an upheaval of the first order affecting the humanist domain
as well as the natural sciences, anthropology as well as geology or
paleontology. It is interesting to examine the conditions under which
research in Antiquity, traditionally dependent on philology, was able to
elaborate its own model of development by freeing itself from the primacy
of text over monument, from the cult of the work of art in favor of the
history of material culture, from the centrality of universal history
in favor of the diversity of regional and local histories.
<p>
This work, begun in Germany with Johann Winckelmann, in France with
the Comte de Caylus, in England with the "Society of Dilettanti," took
shape in a private international society founded in Rome in 1829. The
"Instituto di Corrispondenza


<b></b>


Archeologica," created by Christian von Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador
to Rome, and supported by a host of scholars and aristocrats including
the crown prince of Prussia (the future Friedrich Wilhelm IV), Count
Metternich, the Duc de Blacas, and a young German scholar, Eduard Gerhard,
is the ancestor of all our modern archaeological institutions. It embodies
a universal model of knowledge that owes its style to Alexander von
Humboldt and its tradition to Gerhard.
<p>
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, passion for Antiquity was
expressed by collection, imitation of ancient works of art, and study of
literary sources: the collector, the artist, and the philologist were
the three symbolic res of antiquarian curiosity. Gerhard, born in
1795, knew this milieu well, having frequented it first while studying
in Breslau and Berlin, and then especially during his numerous stays in
Italy. A student of Friedrich August Wolf and August Boeck, he displayed
impeccable philological erudition (in April 1815 he was the first doctor
"<i>rite promotus</i>" of the brand new University of Berlin). Above all
this admirer of Goethe and close friend of Alois Hirt and Ernst Toelken
at the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts exhibited an obvious sensitivity
for art. In this city which openly claimed its royal destiny, the fine
arts were one of the elements of urban and political development. The
Hohenzollern family was moreover heavily involved in the development
of museums and the support of the study of Antiquity. The patronage of
the crown prince and the close friendships that Gerhard had formed with
the milieu of Roman connoisseurs naturally played a decisive role in
this context.
<p>
Gerhard was at once a dedicated scholar, a museum curator, and a
university professor. His professional career lived out the different
stages of the institutionalization of the discipline: he was first a
secondary school instructor, then a simple Prussian grant holder in
Rome, before becoming the secretary of the Institute he had founded,
returning to Germany in 1833 as "archaeologist" of the Berlin museum,
and finally being named professor at the prestigious university in
1844. But his uninterrupted activity did not exhaust the man's ardor:
a member of the Berlin Academy, he promoted great learned enterprises
like the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i> and the inventory of
Etruscan mirrors. The founder of several scholarly journals, he directed
for years the <i>Arch&#x000E4;ologische Zeitung</i> he had created. He
was no stranger either&#x02014;which seems surprising today&#x02014;to the
ancient art trade, from which he was able to make a profit. However, if
we add that he donated all his collections of books and antiquities to
the University of Berlin and that he willed a large sum to the Academy
for the creation of a research grant, we see that the man in his diverse
facets incarnated a type of scholar very different from the aristocrats
or the abb&#x000E9;s of the eighteenth century.
<p>
Published in 1850, thus three years after the first volume of Boucher de
Perthes's <i>Antiquit&#x000E9;s celtiques et ant&#x000E9;diluviennes</i>
and nine years before Darwin's <i>Origin of the Species,</i> the
<i>Archaeological Theses</i> can be considered the emancipation program
for classical archaeology and the establishment of its new course. At this
time Gerhard was fortified by the experience acquired in the creation
of the Instituto, whose three types of publications, <i>Bolletino,
Annali,</i> and <i>Monumenti,</i> were intended to provide the scholarly
public with a complete panoply of editorial tools. The <i>Bolletino</i>
was dedicated


<b></b>


to current information, to following the news; the <i>Annali</i> were
to receive scholarly communications from the corresponding members;
and the <i>Monumenti</i> (which took up an old idea of Winckelmann's)
were designed to offer detailed publication of the monuments and great
series of objects of Antiquity. Around these three tools, an international
community of scholars and patrons worked to provide the Istituto with
an effective editorial and documentary structure.
<p>
It was a project at once universalist (even if limited to the
Mediterranean world) and functionalist: only systematic publication
of antiquities would allow for their understanding and their
protection. Gerhard and his colleagues&#x02014;of course, he was not
alone&#x02014;saw in the Istituto an instrument for the dissemination
of knowledge with the goal of saving the archaeological patrimony
of Antiquity in the way Renaissance scholars had made accessible, and
oftentimes rediscovered, textual sources. When Gerhard invented the term
<i>monumental philology</i> to characterize his project in opposition
to traditional philology, he positioned himself as the inventor of a new
approach to antiquity, just as Alde Manuce and Guillaume Bud&#x000E9; had
revolutionized the history of the classical tradition. Emancipated from
a weighty indenture, archaeology participates by other means in the same
goal as philology. Faced with the activity of artists and collectors,
archaeologists seek to acquire a concrete knowledge of objects and
monuments. Antiquity should not remain a model to imitate, but should
become a source of innovation. The archaeologist's task will be to
observe the great ancient corpus with positive methods of description
and analysis.
<p>
Gerhard's <i>Archaeological Theses</i> are the product of a positivist
overturning of the curiosity for the past, seeking not only to
establish rules of description, but to give archaeologists indices,
tools, techniques, in short the entire arsenal of an independent
discipline. To that end, archaeology must have the right means. At
the University of Berlin Gerhard created, against the advice of the
philologists, a <i>Lehrapparat:</i> a collection of books, iconographic
volumes, ancient objects, and casts designed for pedagogy. It is at the
University that future archaeologists would henceforth learn the rules
of their profession, before objects that they would be allowed to touch,
to see, and to see again.
<p>
Gerhard insisted on this material and technical side of archaeological
education: <i>"Monumentorum artis quis unum vidit, nullum vidit, quis
millia vidit, unum vidit."</i> (He who sees one art monument sees none;
he who sees thousands, sees one.) He was not the founding father of
a new discipline, for others before him, and after him, brought their
contribution to the establishment of archaeology, but at a century's
distance from his illustrious predecessor the Comte de Caylus, he was
able to express in a concise and effective formulation the intangible
rules of the profession.

The World Trade Center and the Paradox of Garbage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
There is something profoundly archaeological about the experience of
9/11 and its aftermath. Less than a month after the attack a meeting of
representatives of thirty-three museums, headed by the Smithsonian and
New York's City Museum, considered how they might document the event,
asking what things should be collected and preserved for display and
for posterity.
<p>
A year later an exhibition opened at the Smithsonian; it continues
its tour into 2004. "Bearing Witness to History" displays artifacts
and associated stories, photographs and documents from the events of
9/11: a battered wallet, a melted computer screen from the Pentagon,
torn clothing, a structural joint from the World Trade Center, a
window washer's squeegee handle, a stairwell sign, as well as artifacts
associated with the aftermath (commemorative coins, artwork, patriotic
ribbons, rescue equipment). Other exhibitions have run at the Museum of
the City of New York and the New York State Museum in Albany.
<p>
The project was explicitly one of documenting history in the making. Some
of this was done with the notion of finding evidence. Actually, and
more accurately, the museum curators and archaeologists sought material
icons. Each of the artifacts displayed in the Smithsonian exhibition has
a story attached, one that ties it to an individual or event that bears
significance and pathos. And they certainly evoke. Their aura is very
apparent. Each acts as a touchstone; not so much illuminating the topics
of political and forensic interest, the exhibits are material correlates


<b></b>


for the intimate personal experiences, the individual stories. This is
what we mean when we call the things iconic.

Briefcase recovered from the World Trade Center.
<p>
Description: A briefcase recovered from the World Trade Center wreckage
that belonged to Lisa Lefler, an Aon Risk Services employee.
<p>
Context: World Trade Center workers had varied experiences on September
11. While about 2,200 office workers were killed, over 20,000 managed
to escape the Twin Towers.
<p>
When the first plane struck the north tower, Lisa Lefler, an Aon Risk
Services executive, immediately evacuated her 103rd-floor office in
the south tower. In her haste she left her briefcase behind. Seventeen
minutes after the north tower was hit the south tower was struck, cutting
off the escape path above the 78th floor. Fifty-six minutes later, the
entire building collapsed, killing 175 of Lefler's fellow Aon employees.
<p>
Several days later, Boyd Harden, a rescue worker at Ground Zero, found
the briefcase in the debris and returned it to Lefler.

<p>
There is an intimacy here in the material artifact and its testimony to
an everyday event (going to work at the World Trade Center) that became
historical. The quotidian becomes the materialization of a historical
moment. This is a process of archaeological metamorphosis: mundane things
come to carry the baggage of history; they become allegorical. There is
also an elision in this process: conventional historiography (of chains of
causation, sociopolitical analysis, telling of the unfolding of events on
a political stage) slips away, is irrelevant in the confrontation between
the banality of everyday life, sentimental association and the apocalyptic
(confrontations with horror, death, the clash of civilizations).
<p>
The question of what stuff to keep is one of conservation, of value
and choice: it is profoundly archaeological, relating to the systems of
classification at the core of museology. But the archaeological component
of 9/11 is more than just artifacts. The photographs in the <i>New York
Times</i> and elsewhere of neighboring apartments abandoned and covered in
thick layers of dust as the towers came down are archaeological moments
frozen in time just like Pompeii, abandoned to its own disaster.
<p>
The twin towers site itself became an icon of ruin: photographs of
the remains of the building's steel framework silhouetted against the
lights illuminating the search, the clearing operation, the excavation
are classic compositions borrowing the aesthetic of a backlit Greek
temple colonnade.
<p>
All the proposals for rebuilding the site included museums of
some kind. The final choice of architect is very telling. Daniel
Libeskind is the designer of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, a remarkable
memorial to twentieth-century Jewish experience, a building marked by a
historiographical component&#x02014;the past, the old street plan around
the museum, and many other features of the architecture of community
and holocaust are built into the design of the museum.
<p>
Many of the objects in <i>Bearing Witness to History</i> are
<i>responses</i> to 9/11: commemorative pins and medals, picks and
hard hats from the rescue operation, photographs. The exhibition looks
back at the debris of history, but its collection of the memorable
is <i>future-oriented:</i> the purpose is to preserve for future
generations. There has been great concern that the replacement for
the World Trade Center should be a monument of hope and confidence in
the future, as well as a commemoration of its origins and the site's
past. This again is a characteristic of archaeology. Since at least
the late nineteenth century the field has been intimately associated
with conservation policy aimed at preserving heritage and material
history for the future. This is, for most cultural resource managers,
as the professionals are now termed, the primary archaeological
project&#x02014;less the interpretation of the past (that can wait), and
more a project to ensure that the remains of the past will endure, in
themselves or as some kind of formal and sanctioned record, particularly
under the pressure of urban and rural development. This conservation
ethic (loss and destruction of the material past is unacceptable) goes
unquestioned in the academy and the profession. The Soviet occupation
chose to obliterate traces of Hitler's bunker in Berlin in 1945; this
kind of destruction of history would be unthinkable now and is even
a difficult comparison to make with 9/11, yet both the bunker and the
remains of the World Trade Center are


<b></b>


evidence of outrageous and violent aspiration. The difference is, of
course, related to different notions of historicity&#x02014;the perceived
place in history of Americans today and Soviets in the 1940s.
<p>
Many of the objects preserved by the Smithsonian and other museums came
from the evidence recovery operation at the Staten Island Landfill site,
commonly known as Fresh Kills. Here we approach the irony at the heart of
the archaeological project. The twin towers site was designated a scene of
crime and the debris was removed to the newly reopened landfill site on
Staten Island to be carefully sifted for evidence, personal remains and
effects, and memorabilia. So, choices having been made and the valuable
retrieved, the debris has been consigned to the biggest garbage tip in
the world. It is certainly the most prominent human artifact visible from
space (the Great Wall of China is quite invisible). Where else could over
a million tons of building rubble be put, it might be argued. Our point
is rather that the destination of the debris is neither incidental nor an
embarrassment. Put aside choice of what to keep: this is the real stuff
of archaeology and history&#x02014;what gets thrown away&#x02014;garbage.
<p>
While a common perception may be that archaeology is a set of techniques
aimed at the recovery of remains of the past, we want to claim these
components of the experience of 9/11 for archaeology&#x02014;that is,
we describe them as archaeological. To recap: the archaeological refers
to ruin and responses to it, to the mundane and quotidian articulated
with grand historical scenarios, to materializations of the experience
of history, material aura, senses of place and history, choices of what
to keep and what to let go (remember/forget), the material artifact as
allegorical, collections and their systems, the city and its material
cultural capitalizations (investments in pasts and futures), the intimate
connection between all this and a utopian frame of mind (archaeology is
not just about the past, but about desired futures too). And the stuff
of it all is garbage.
<p>
We have taken 9/11 as an iconic (post)modern event and
experience. Implicit then in our view of it as (partially, though not
incidentally) an archaeological event and experience are two related
propositions. First, modernity is unthinkable without its museal and
archaeological component. Second, given the association of archaeology
and garbage, this cultural imaginary is at the heart of the composition
and decomposition of modernity and modernism.
<p>
We will not be able to fully defend these propositions here. We have
more limited aims in this paper. Much of our definition of the scope
of archaeology goes far beyond the conventional boundaries of the
discipline and is quite simply not accepted by our colleagues. One of
our aims is to account for this irony in contemporary notions of the
archaeological. In spite of garbage being the basis of archaeology,
archaeologists have consistently denied or ignored the resulting
implications in favor of other understandings of their project. We will
illustrate how others outside the discipline and profession have realized
the archaeological component of modernity. More generally, garbage is
a modern conundrum&#x02014;while there is more of it than ever and its
management is a great challenge, garbage is hugely misunderstood and
popularly ignored (other than as an environmental issue). Again, we will
illustrate some alternate and archaeological understandings of garbage.

Archaeology and Garbage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Our previous section has set the scene with an indication of the scope
of what we call the archaeological. Prominent in this field is garbage.
<p>
Garbage: 99 percent or more of what most archaeologists dig up,
record, and analyze in obsessive detail is what past peoples threw
away as worthless&#x02014;broken ceramics, broken or dulled stone tools,
tool-making debitage, food-making debris, food waste, broken glass,
rusted metal, on and on. These are society's material dregs that even
those most clever at salvage couldn't re a way to use or sell. But
ask archaeologists what archaeology focuses on and they will mention
"the past" and "artifacts" and "behavior" and "attitudes and beliefs,"
but you will rarely, if ever, hear the words "garbage" or "refuse" or
"trash" or "junk."
<p>
For most of human time, our predecessors simply dropped items on the
ground when they became unwanted. When they began living in permanent
settlements, sometimes they threw their discards into old storage pits,
dropped them down privies, or even intentionally dug garbage pits to bury
them. Less often, only in relatively recent times and at highly populated
centers, specialized work groups would expend a great deal of time and
trouble to move the larger pieces of detritus from the streets, where
they were thrown or abandoned, to a "midden" or "dump" on the outskirts
of a city. In return, the "scavengers" who did the moving kept whatever
"worthwhile" discards they found in the streets.
<p>
To be blunt, forget the adventures of Indiana Jones (another modernist
trope)! All archaeologists root around in the remnants and offal of
the past. Ever so scientifically, but it is rooting nonetheless. It
may be something of a surprise that this connection between archaeology
and garbage (archaeologists <i>study</i> garbage) was only firmly made
in the 1970s&#x02014;in the aftermath of a new anthropological turn in
the discipline. And the association is still consistently denied and
misunderstood.
<p>
Nor is the category as self-evident as it may seem. Archaeologists
of the prehistory of northern Europe have, in the last decade or
so, identified a distinctive category of behavior that cuts across
definitions of garbage. "Structured deposition" is the deliberate
creation of "archaeological" deposits, the deliberate burying of goods,
artifacts, stuff that we might regard as discard, but that was clearly
of significance to people in the past. So much so that J. D. Hill has
argued that the pits that litter Iron Age sites in the United Kingdom and
seem to contain garbage are far from what they seem&#x02014;are carefully
organized depositions rather than random accumulations of family garbage.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Here, of course, we need to recognize that concepts of waste are
culturally specific, as are notions of purity and dirt.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
In 1973, in order to initiate an "archaeology of us," the "Garbage
Project" at the University of Arizona began systematically collecting,
sorting through, and recording household refuse as it was put out at
the curb.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Most archaeologists denied that the Project's workers were doing
archaeology! Some authorities still deny it.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Their rationale has usually been that the Project's garbage wasn't
old enough to be worthy of archaeological analysis. When pressed,
these critics would cite the "fifty-year rule"&#x02014;


<b></b>


mandates legislated around the country that (depending upon the state)
artifacts and sites had to be at least twenty-five to fifty years old
in order to be considered appropriate grist for an archaeologist's mill
or for government protection.
<p>
This seems a strange riddle in itself, since every single day a new
batch of materials methodically emerges from the black hole of modern
times into the light of archaeological research. It is a significant
aspect of the garbage conundrum that archaeologists believe they
should wait an arbitrary time to begin research while all kinds of
information about how and where and when artifacts and sites were
generated&#x02014;critical information on the most intimate dynamics of
our social systems&#x02014;degrades.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Two articles published by archaeologists in 2002 about
"exo-archaeology"&#x02014;the archaeology of outer space&#x02014;clearly
illustrate that the garbage conundrum is currently alive and well among
contemporary archaeologists. They are failing to understand the place of
garbage in the field we are calling archaeological. We were interested
in what the articles had to say because one of us wrote an essay on
"exo-archaeology"
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
in which he mentioned that we earthlings have populated our surrounding
space with our own garbage. Actually, we have launched about ten thousand
"resident space objects," such as fifteen hundred upper stage rockets
and myriad explosive bolts and clamp bands, along, of course, with
urine and "other" bags. Rathje concluded that this high-speed space
junk&#x02014;which is a major hazard to any future flights&#x02014;is the
natural study area of archaeologists.
<p>
It was something of a shock to find out that in an article entitled
"The Case for Exo-Archaeology," Vicky A. Walsh wrote that the mission of
exo-archaeology was to "evaluate distant worlds for signs of intelligent
life" (was this taken from a <i>Star Trek</i> script?&#x02014;Jean-Luc
Picard is a keen amateur archaeologist).
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The author never mentioned the issue of how to identify alien garbage
or, for that matter, our garbage, which is the most prolific sign of our
"intelligent" life in space . . . and on Earth!
<p>
Even more unexpected was the paper by Greg Fewer, called "Towards an LSMR
and MSMR (Lunar and Martian Sites &amp; Monuments Records): Recording
the Planetary Spacecraft Landing Sites as Archaeological Monuments of
the Future."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Yes, let's record landing sites for posterity. But what about the myriad
threats to our future spacecraft from the voluminous hurtling junk
discarded from our past ventures? And it is not just the Americans
and the Russians anymore. At the end of September 2003, Europeans
launched their first unmanned spacecraft to the moon. China's program
is not far behind, and more space cowboys&#x02014;and space tourists,
like U.S. businessman Dennis Tito who reportedly paid the Russians
$20 million for a ride to the international space station and back in
2001&#x02014;are sure to follow.
<p>
To complicate matters further, ask yourself: What kinds of garbage have
other space travelers in other parts of our galaxy and beyond discarded
that are now hazards to our space travelers? If we are dedicated to
continuing the exploration of space, can we continue to ignore such
questions? The report from the committee that investigated the tragic
Discovery burn-up called for a complete revamping of the safety culture
at NASA. Perhaps it is also time to look at NASA's "garbage culture,"
or lack of it.
<p>
Our point&#x02014;archaeologists (and others) are not thinking clearly
about garbage.


<b></b>


<p>
We do need to be careful with our definitions. We are defining garbage
broadly as subsuming themes of ruin, remains, discard, decay, hygiene,
dirt, and disease. We are including cognates such as litter, trash,
and junk, though we may choose to give these more specific focus.
<p>
Why so broad? Because we see garbage as a fundamental part of the field
we are calling the archaeological. Why, specifically, should ruin
be included? Just think of where modern ruins are. Ask what happens
to buildings today. Most landfill sites are dominated by building
rubble. Landfill sites are modernity's ruins.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Archaeology and Culture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Tips and middens are the kind of places archaeologists
work. Archaeologists sift through detritus. But until the 1970s we
seek in vain any explicit recognition of the archaeological site as a
garbage heap. This section asks&#x02014;what has been conceived as the
object of archaeology, if not garbage? And how have archaeological sites
been conceived?
<p>
There is a simple answer, well established, that is associated with the
choice archaeologists make of what to keep and study. Archaeologists
have usually been seeking items and relationships they consider of
value&#x02014;<i>cultural</i> value. These are often seen as buried within
the detritus of ancient sites and lost some time ago, needing rescue,
in the face of decay and further loss. The object of archaeology has,
for most of the history of the discipline, been seen as "culture,"
and its (iconic, metonymic, and metaphoric) representatives.
<p>
The establishment of state and national museums from the late eighteenth
century certainly created a demand for exceptional works of art. Museums
also attended to this demand with their sponsorship of excavations,
particularly of the ancient civilizations. This was complemented by the
growth of the art market in antiquities. Here the object of archaeological
interest was, and often still is, the work of high culture.
<p>
Edward Tylor, following German ethnology and <i>Kulturgeschichte</i>,
delivered a classic anthropological definition of culture in his
<i>Primitive Culture</i> : "that complex whole which includes
knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and other capabilities and
habits acquired by man as a member of society."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Tied to evolutionary theory this concept constituted a new object of
archaeology&#x02014;more mundane material items that could delineate
stages of cultural development, from savagery to civilization. From
1880 to 1920 the archaeological site was conceived as repository, with
archaeological fieldwork as the ordered retrieval of objects/artifacts,
to be the subject of typological study.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
The prevailing conception of the past was the evolution of culture.
<p>
In the early twentieth century, and correlated with a shift in
anthropological thought from the notion of history as the evolutionary
progression of culture in general to a focus upon individual
"ethnographic" cultures (think of Franz Boas), Gustav Kossinna and
Gordon Childe pioneered a shift to an interest in locally circumscribed
assemblages of goods and culture groups (<i>HAT,</i> 163-74). From
1920 to 1960, this <i>culture history</i> aimed to track the origins,
movements, and interactions of prehistoric peoples


<b></b>


through their material culture. History was seen as a geographical mosaic
of more or less clearly delineated cultural groups expressed in their
goods. With respect to fieldwork, this archaeology required control
over time-space systematics (local phasing and the spatial boundaries
of local culture groups), hence the refinement of techniques designed to
enable the definition of assemblages and culture groups (close attention
to qualitative variability), including an emphasis upon stratification
to control chronology. The prevailing conception of the past was the
history of culture groups; the objects of archaeology were no longer
simply the dead fossils of general cultural progress.
<p>
We write 1960 as a terminus, but it would be more correct to acknowledge
that culture history is still an orthodoxy in many archaeological
traditions. Archaeology's nineteenth-century metanarratives of
evolution and nationalism and preoccupations with ethnicity and progress
(<i>HAT,</i> chapters 4 and 5) are still very powerful hegemonic forces.
<p>
At the heart of academic and museum-based archaeology are changing notions
of the artifact in relation to the human groups or cultures that produce
it, the temporality of culture change/process, and the loci of both:
notions of region and site. Classic archaeological topics thus include:
specialized approaches to artifact study, typology, function and style,
phasing, artifact groups, classification of cultures, ethnicity, the
site and settlement, time and culture change, concepts of period and
phase, the characterization and archaeological visibility of events,
the nature of the archaeological record, deposits and contexts, agency
and material culture, comparative method, and analogy.
<p>
Walter W. Taylor's book <i>A Study of Archaeology</i>  was part of a
polemic for a new functionalist archaeology, more sociological (he called
it conjunctive) (<i>HAT,</i> 276). He pointed out that archaeologists
in the late 1940s still ignored much material and were overwhelmingly
qualitative. He argued that material remains were <i>products</i> of
culture rather than culture itself. Like Grahame Clark he wanted to use
archaeological finds to reconstruct ancient lives rather than to track
ethnic groups.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
With a revitalized neoevolutionary theory in the 1950s (led by
Leslie White and Julian Steward in particular) came ecological,
demographic and technological determinism, but also an explicit shift
from artifact-centered culture history to the workings of culture,
cultural process. This was the beginnings of New Archaeology. From 1960
the archaeological site came to be treated as a record of behavioral
patterns, structured activities to be revealed through close analysis of
contextual associations in the material <i>remains</i>. The prevailing
view of the past was much more anthropological in its focus upon
cultural behavior.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
John Myres had recognized in print that archaeologists dealt with a far
from complete sample of the remains of the past, and observed that the
archaeological record consisted of discarded goods.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Grahame Clark had initiated a study of the processes of preservation
that make up the archaeological matrix, but it was not until the 1970s
that archaeology came to focus on what made it truly distinct&#x02014;the
discard, ruin, loss and decay that constitutes the remains of the past,
and upon which archaeologists work.
<p>
David Clarke emphasized that archaeology was a disciplinary field distinct
from anthropology and history&#x02014;distinct by virtue of its object.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
He called for pre- and postdepositional theory and explicitly drew
attention to the fragmentary character of archaeological data samples. It
was only then that the link between archaeology and


<b></b>


garbage became conceivable. One of us began the Garbage Project,
mentioned above:
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
the anthropological turn in the discipline, a posteriori (in the stress
upon behavioral rather than historical study), brought the present into
the field of archaeology. By 1976 Mike Schiffer was calling for what
he called a behavioral archaeology that studied site formation processes,
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
and New Archaeologists, again with their explicit anthropological
perspective, began conducting ethnoarchaeological fieldwork to
investigate the dynamics of just such processes&#x02014;discard, rot,
ruin, curation, preservation.
<p>
What here is the object of archaeological study? It is human behavior
and social practices and their relation, through formation processes
of the archaeological record to the remains upon which archaeologists
work. This field can now explicitly include garbage, conceived as part
of the dynamics of archaeological site formation processes. But there is
still little <i>emphasis</i> upon such dynamics that are at the heart of
the archaeological&#x02014;discard, decay, ruin. Garbage and site formation
processes are conceived as <i>means to an end</i>&#x02014;metamorphic
processes that come between what archaeologists deal with in the present
and what they desire&#x02014;past culture, social process, whatever. In
this, site formation processes are a problem or, minimally, something to
be overcome, seen through, accounted for, on the way to what is really
valued and desired.
<p>
As something of an aside, because again we do not have the space to
explore it, we note another, and closely related, archaeological
irony. That, in spite of the prevalence of goods and the material
commodity form in modernity, only recently has the study of material
culture emerged as a disciplinary field. Materiality has been
conspicuously undertheorized.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
A Short History of Modern Garbage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
The previous section outlined an irony of contemporary
archaeology&#x02014;that the material basis of history is an embarrassment
to the discipline that works upon it. This section describes what is
specific about <i>modern</i> conceptions of garbage. It focuses upon the
irony and conundrum of contemporary garbage&#x02014;its ubiquity is denied,
ignored and misunderstood, or simply constitutes an embarrassment and a
problem. This irony and conundrum unites archaeology and broader cultural
attitudes towards garbage.
<p>
To describe garbage, our discards, the artifacts that at some point
are no longer wanted, we often use the truism "out of sight, out of
mind." That, indeed, seems to be a sincere goal&#x02014;to totally eradicate
our discards. Our utter abhorrence and disdain for refuse is obviously
learned, as we are the only species whose members are not magnetically
drawn to garbage by its smell and its panoply of colors. Further, no
society has ever invested more thought and resources into "getting rid"
of its unwanted remains than contemporary America.
<p>
But the beginning of the conundrum of garbage is that we haven't
succeeded. We create more refuse per person than any other society
(the Canadians, oddly enough, argue vociferously that they throw more
away than we do!). Our throwaways are visible everywhere as litter; and
containers for castoffs are about as common as street lights outdoors
and tables indoors&#x02014;they are everywhere.


<b></b>


<p>
And yet we still seem to remain largely oblivious to litter (what <i>Keep
America Beautiful</i> calls "garbage out of place") and to garbage
containers and their contents. There is certainly little systematic
understanding of garbage. People don't really see the garbage&#x02014;or
the implications of the garbage&#x02014;that they, like everyone around
them, generate every day.
<p>
For example, the most common truism about garbage&#x02014;"out of sight,
out of mind"&#x02014;is a part of the garbage conundrum. Just consider
Alexandra Martini's <i>Litter Only: A Book about Dustbins</i> ,
a stunning compilation of photographs of garbage receptacles (mostly in
public places) worldwide&#x02014;261-plus containers in 249 locales in 130
countries from Hardangervidda, Norway to Ujung Pandang, Indonesia. As
the introduction asserts, "look at the container, look how universal
the role of the trash can is."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
And what is one of the surest correlates of a public trash
container? Litter nearby. We each see the contents of indoor garbage
cans, even the ones hidden behind the door under the sink.
<p>
In point of fact, garbage and garbage containers are almost always
<i>in</i> sight.
<p>
Consider the garbage realities of contemporary life. We'll bet good money
that there's a garbage container in most rooms of your house. There are
garbage containers in most public spaces and rooms. How far are you at
any time from a garbage receptacle in a mall? How often are you more
than thirty feet from a garbage receptacle? On an interstate&#x02014;sure,
but garbage containers are more frequent and available than gas for your
car or food for you!&#x02014;and National Parks&#x02014;the natural beauty
is studded with trash containers.
<p>
So how do we deal with all this garbage that pervades our lives? This
brings up the conundrum again. "Living" reconstructions of the past,
where tourists walk through "accurate" replicas of life in previous times,
are a very telling example of the way our unspoken concerns about garbage
permeate our lives and how much we don't want garbage "in sight," even
though containers for it are everywhere.
<p>
Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C.,
is called a "living museum" frequented by presidents, potentates and the
public alike. Note that the "authentically reconstructed" Early American
site is honeycombed with trash containers. And, as part of this scenario,
the living museum is constantly crisscrossed by vehicles that collect
the day's trash for disposal.
<p>
This site demonstrates that not only is our revulsion for garbage
cultural, but that it is growing at an exponential rate. The site's
original inhabitants would have been totally mystified by such
behavior. They were accustomed to throwing garbage in the street&#x02014;in
fact, the role of men walking on the street side of women was not started
to protect women from being splashed by passing vehicles; instead,
the man walked on the outside to take the brunt of the garbage thrown
at the street from second-floor windows.
<p>
Quite honestly, if Williamsburg were today an accurate reconstruction
of Colonial times, it would be closed down within a day for health and
safety violations!
<p>
Put all this together and you reach the inescapable conclusion about
garbage&#x02014;that we should not be saying, "out of sight, out of mind,"
but instead, "we can see it; we don't like it; get it out of here!"


<b></b>


<p>
What does this mean?
<p>
First, let's get rid of the concept that garbage means disease. The
original late-nineteenth-century rationale for cleaning garbage out
of streets was based on the theory of "miasma." This asserted that
"vapors" from filth and refuse were the causes of infection. This led
to modern refuse pickup, such as New York City's under the direction
of Colonel Waring in the 1890s. With the arrival of "germ theory,"
miasma theory fell by the way&#x02014;yes, garbage is not hygienic; but
it is also not drastically depopulating cities&#x02014;but the push for
immaculate cleanliness lingered on. It has become a main component,
indeed a primary rationale for contemporary urban management.
<p>
Garbage is <i>in</i> sight everywhere! Perhaps this ubiquity obstructs
our understanding of the impact of our lives on the material world around
us. Or does garbage represent something that we are truly afraid of? The
mortality even of our material possessions, never mind our own material
mortality. Things that were eminently useful are constantly being interred
as garbage. Is this too relevant to our own lifecycle?
<p>
In effect, the biggest problem in "garbage education" is that even though
garbage is visible everywhere, most people don't see it. As a result,
there is no way easily to put garbage on people's radar screens.
<p>
A good example is what people think is in landfills. Ask
anyone&#x02014;educators, students (all ages), environmentalists,
businessmen, government officials . . . anyone&#x02014;what takes up the
most landfill space, and the most common responses will be Styrofoam, fast
food packaging, and disposable diapers. The Garbage Project's twenty-one
landfill digs demonstrate that if you add all three of those landfill
villains together, they fill up less than 3 percent of Municipal Solid
Waste (MSW) landfill space.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
Why are the estimates so wrong? Simple. Those who don't deal with refuse
for their livelihood don't carefully notice and mentally record the
garbage they or other people discard. What forms their mental image
of garbage is not what is normally thrown away. Instead, what sticks
in their minds about garbage is the garbage that <i>shocks</i> them,
and that is garbage out of place-litter. And litter is often Styrofoam,
fast food packaging, and disposable diapers (it is our experience that
you can usually find a garbage can at a interstate rest stop by looking
for the pile of disposable diapers covering it).
<p>
The way people perceive garbage is also the reason that newspapers
get recycled, but household food waste hasn't diminished in thirty
years. Newspapers are often kept in stacks, so how quickly they build up
makes an impression. Food waste is not saved in a corner of the kitchen,
so the food preparer and the food consumers are not constantly confronted
with the quantities they waste.
<p>
The incredible degree to which people can overlook food waste is
best illustrated by a study the Garbage Project conducted for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Sample households were divided into four groups&#x02014;all households were
asked for permission before their refuse was collected and sorted. In
the middle of a five-week garbage collection/recording period,
householders in three groups were asked to report their edible food
discards verbally. Not surprisingly, very few respondents owned up
to any food waste; nonetheless, their refuse contained, on average,
one-eighth pound of wasted food (not including rinds, peels, skins,
bones, etc.) per person per day.


<b></b>


<p>
A fourth group of households was given plastic bags and asked to save all
the edible food they would have thrown away. They produced one-quarter
pound of wasted food per person per day! But there was an even more
interesting finding: the households that gave researchers bags of food
"waste" still threw away in their garbage cans one-eighth pound of wasted
food per person per day. They "invented" food waste for the researchers
to collect at the front door and still didn't see or decrease the food
they threw out the back.
<p>
But by far the most striking example of how little we recognize our
discards is based on watching photographers at landfills wading through
garbage at least twenty feet deep. At some point the photographers
have to change their film roll or video cartridge. Almost invariably,
they rip open the film pack, hold the foil or box for a minute, and then
stare up with a quizzical look and ask, "Is there anywhere around here
I can throw this?" The answer, of course, is, "Just drop it!"

<!--_a-head-->
Garbage&#x02014;The Tropes of Modernism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
This section looks at who else (after the previous sections) has
<i>actually</i> explored and worked on the archaeological matter of
garbage, and how.
<p>
To begin, let us recap. We propose a definition of archaeology that
takes us beyond the academic discipline.

<ul>
<li> Archaeologists work on material fragments, poor samples, usually,
but not necessarily, of the past. The fragments may be artifacts or
any other kind of material: the subjects of archaeological interest
cut across the distinction between the natural and the cultural. Under
this definition archaeology is a practice of <i>mediation</i>, working
between past and present.</li>
<li>The fragments of archaeological interest are often what may be
classed as garbage. Our definition of garbage includes cognates like
junk, trash, and litter and extends to ruins&#x02014;garbage is what is
discarded and abandoned as of no use. Discard relates garbage to the
(economic) cycle of design, manufacture, distribution, consumption, and
discard&#x02014;garbage is a process. And the process includes abrasion,
decay, and entropy.</li>
<li>This association of garbage with a general economy undermines the
categorical separation of garbage from other aspects of the production,
exchange, consumption, and discard of goods.</li>
<li> Questions of value lie at the base of archaeological work upon
garbage. What is of such value that it should be protected and preserved?</li>
<li>These questions of value are immediately questions of
categorization&#x02014;is something junk, or a work of art, or a historical
source, or a personal souvenir?</li>
<li>Here are questions of representation&#x02014;what should be preserved
on the grounds that it represents something valued, or represents a
particular category?</li>
<li> This field of assignation of value and of categorization has to do
with notions of cultural archiving&#x02014;what is fit to join an archive?


<b></b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With such a definition it is possible to identify many archaeological
fields within modernity and modernism that have focused upon garbage. We
will deal with these through their tropic forms&#x02014;the characters,
plots and scenarios that give them shape and meaning. Tellingly perhaps,
few are historiographical and overtly archaeological. Of necessity we
will have to be a little sketchy in our review.

Modern Cities in Ruin

<p>
Notes from an archaeological excavation in the year 2500
<small>A.D.</small>:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The oldest layer was a heavy clay flecked with charcoal and ash. It held
chips of glass, the neck of a whisky bottle (Johnnie Walker, from the
shape), a flattened plastic jug, a charred piece of motor tire, several
cables, pipes, and architectural debris from the museum portico. The best
find was a stack of magazines. Charred and waterlogged, they'd evidently
been part of a bundle awaiting delivery or recycling. It took an hour to
peel them apart&#x02014;like trying to separate sodden <i>mille-feuille</i>
pastry. In the middle was a single legible scrap, with what appeared to
be a title. Something on Flaubert? I set the leaf to dry in the sun,
and the print became clear: "I am Madame B. Ovary." I'd unearthed the
Reader's Digest . . . I went back to the tree-throw and picked the roots
clean. This produced more glass, some corroded costume jewellery, two
shell-cases from a rifle or light machine-gun, part of a willow-pattern
gravy boat, and the well-preserved sole of a running shoe&#x02014;a Puma,
no less.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
These impromptu excavations are in front of the ruins of the British
Museum, the excavator a time traveler from the late twentieth century,
arriving in a time machine "borrowed" from Tatiana Cherenkova,
nineteenth-century genius associate of Tesla and mistress of Wells. The
artifacts that our narrator recovers are all twentieth-century examples
of those that archaeological reports describe in such detail: building
debris, glass, ceramic, jewelry etc. But we would describe none of these
artifacts as "high culture." They are the lowliest of archaeological
artifacts: debris, trash, junk . . . garbage.
<p>
Another excavation, of a different kind:

<p>
In both stories, the main protagonists journey into the ruins of
our world to discover a truth. This is a frequently occurring motif,
even a genre, in science fiction and its generic precursor, scientific
romance: J. G. Ballard's <i>Hello America</i> , <i>Memories of
the Space Age</i> , and <i>The Drowned World</i> ; Russell
Hoban's <i>Riddley Walker</i> ; John Christopher's <i>The White
Mountains</i> ; John Ames Mitchell's <i>The Last American</i>
; George Stewart's <i>Earth Abides</i> ; H. G. Wells's
<i>The Time Machine</i> . A full bibliography and "filmography"
would be too voluminous to include here&#x02014;we direct the reader to
Clarke's annotated bibliography, Warren Wagar's <i>Terminal Visions</i>,
and Brian Stableford's <i>Scientific Romance in Britain 1890-1950.</i>
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
We can trace this scenario back to the beginnings of the romantic
movement. The most striking imagery is often the direct descendent
of romantic images of ivy-clad classical ruins, of sketches and
paintings of the silted-up Roman forum, of ruin and the picturesque
in Turner and Friedrich. Even within these beginnings, there were
examples of the <i>contemporary</i> city imagined as ruin: Hubert
Robert's <i>Vue imaginaire de la Grande Galerie du Louvre en ruines</i>,
Louis-S&#x000E9;bastien Mercier's description of the Palace of Versailles's
ruins, Mary Shelley's account of twenty-first century ruins in <i>The Last
Man</i>, John Soane's designs for the new Bank of England presented in
cross-sectional ruin. The imagery's history is such that it can stand for
any number of different and sometimes contradictory ideas: the triumph
of nature, the transience of cultural achievement, the folly of human
ambition, humankind's self-destructive urges, the end of the world, new
beginnings, fate, and future. But in each representation, the audience
recognizes that the city is not frozen in aspic. Time continues its work
on the remains.
<p>
Albert Speer's neoclassical plans for Hitler's Berlin incorporated a
theory of ruin value
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
&#x02014;that buildings should be built so that even when collapsed
and in ruin they would present a grand and impressive sight. This
was not his experience of industrial dereliction&#x02014;the theory was
formulated in response to his first commission to rebuild in stone the
Nuremberg stadium for Nazi party rallies when several vehicle depots were
demolished and presented an ugly sight of twisted iron reinforcing bars.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Metamorphic Process
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Evident in all these works is an interest in the metamorphic processes
of history&#x02014;the material textures of decay. Of course, a whole
host of biologists, geographers, urban planners, and engineers have
contemplated the forces acting on modern cities. Mike Davis identifies
Richard Jefferies's <i>After London</i>  as the progenitor of this
particular genre of writing.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
In a kind of ecofiction, Jefferies, with a naturalist's eye,
describes the plants and animals that would return to London after its
abandonment. Davis traces Jefferies's literary descendants: Morris,
London, Stewart, and others.
<p>
We would go much further though and connect this genre to a focus on
what becomes of things as their form and context changes, as they become
incorporated into different lives, become history, or garbage, as they
slip into new associations. This is the very subject of the art of,
for example, Cornelia Parker:

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Ruin and the Abject
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Ruin res prominently in the British Neo-Romantic painters of the
mid-twentieth century. The work of Paul Nash and John Piper resonates
with historical echoes in the prehistoric monuments and ruins littering
the landscapes of England. But even Piper's images of maintained buildings
are heavily patinated and exude a temporal quality or texture of imminent
or active decay; they are ruins in the making.
<p>
Hoban's <i>Riddley Walker</i>, quoted above, goes further with a sense of
the abject at the heart of decay&#x02014;moist, odorous and unpleasant. We
might then contrast ruin with urban dereliction, ivy-clad remains with
abject rot. Anselm Keifer's landscapes are far from the picturesque;
they concentrate upon sites of historical events and processes that
are far from comforting, imbued instead with postwar German guilt,
testaments to the death and debris of history.
<p>
The abject is a recurring theme in surrealism. Georges Bataille made it
a focus of his philosophical anthropology. It is a central feature of
the horror genre (<i>EP,</i> 67, 137, 145).

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Utopia and Dystopia
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
From Jules Verne onwards, and in keeping with the paradigm of
nineteenth-century evolutionary thought, the future may promise both
progress and regress. In the classic genre of the postapocalypse story,
the hero is often pitted against urban derelicts or mutants. H. G. Wells's
time traveler encounters pastoral Eloi and brutish Morlocks in the far
distant future. Charlton Heston tackles aberrant mutants in <i>The Omega
Man</i>. In <i>Robocop</i> the enemy is both the criminal underworld
and corrupt unprincipled corporate executives.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
The capitalization of future corporate power is based upon urban and
environmental dereliction. Robocop, the cyborg, is the corporate artifact
designed to manage the human garbage of this dystopia. But the artifact
assumes human qualities and comes to stand for all that the corporate
world denies, and as such becomes guardian of a distinctively human
heritage&#x02014;what threatens to be lost and needs protection against
forces of future anarchy, immorality, the loss of values. Robocop
is a steward and conservator of human values&#x02014;an archaeological
policeman of the future (<i>EP,</i> 54-6).


<b></b>


<p>
The lowlife of the urban and criminal underworld is a scenario familiar
since at least Dickens.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Counterposed against the stereotypical miscellany of drug-dealing
transient and criminal discards, but operating in this world of the
abject human and deeply immersed in its culture, is a classic character
in the archaeological imaginary&#x02014;the detective (<i>EP,</i>
53-4). While his apparent object is crime investigation, his focus is
upon the material textures of the incidental and the overlooked. At
the scene of crime anything may be relevant&#x02014;any discarded item,
what ordinary people overlook or ignore.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Garbage in the Future
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Outside of the postapocalypse story, the casual viewer might not
appreciate the frequency with which garbage features in science fiction
films and novels, instead concentrating on the shiny sets, props, and
costumes of popular clich&#x000E9;. This has changed, particularly since
the 1970s. George Lucas decided to have his <i>Star Wars</i> universe
appear "lived-in"; Ridley Scott's spaceship in <i>Alien</i> was one of
dirty dank corridors, a suitable haunt for an abject creature of the id;
the alleys in <i>Blade Runner</i> are strewn with trash.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
The lived-in future has a longer history in literature: James White's
short story, <i>Deadly Litter</i>, dealt with the hazards of space junk
in 1960.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
We might expect this of purely dystopian settings: dying worlds, choking
on their own pollution. But the garbage is often juxtaposed with shining
futuristic efficiency. The trash compactor of <i>Star Wars</i> lies
in the bowels of a moon-sized superweapon, <i>Battle Angel Alita</i>'s
Scrap Iron City underneath the futuristic floating utopia of Zalem.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
And in these junkyards might lie a surprise: in <i>Star Wars</i>,
a monster; <i>Battle Angel Alita</i>, the shell of a cyborg assassin.
<p>
In the very first scene of the first episode of the world's longest
continuously running science fantasy television show, <i>Doctor Who</i>
(1963-1989), comes a surprise within a surprise. Within I. M. Foreman's
junkyard, at 76 Totters Lane, London, stands an old police telephone
kiosk (outmoded, discarded); within the blue box, an impossibly huge
and hyperfuturistic space-time machine from an alien civilization.

The Quotidian Artifact
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Entropy's steady accumulation of detritus piles up around us.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"The apartments in which no one lives&#x02014;hundreds of them and all full
of the possessions people had, like family photographs and clothes. Those
that died couldn't take anything and those who emigrated didn't want
to. The building, except for my apartment, is completely kipple-ized."
<p>
"'Kipple-ized'?" She did not comprehend.
<p>
"Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use
the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape. When nobody's
around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving
any kipple around your apartment, when you


<b></b>


wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more
and more . . . No one can win against kipple . . . except temporarily and
maybe in one spot, like in my apartment I've created a sort of stasis
between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple, for the time being. But
eventually I'll die or go away, and then the kipple will again take
over. It's a universal principle operating throughout the universe;
the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total, absolute
kippleization."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
Fascination with the quotidian, and particularly what is neglected as
valueless, is a recurring obsession in modernist art and literature. We
have already mentioned detective fiction. Picasso notoriously included
the material everyday in his collages, literally quoting from everyday
life. Duchamp, dada, and artists after have imported found (everyday)
objects into the gallery, counterposing the supposed emptiness and lack
of worth with the presumed value of high culture.
<p>
Pop art, from Warhol through Jeff Koons, has played on the aura of the
everyday and the throwaway consumer item. <i>Detritus.net</i> is dedicated
to appropriation art, the recycling of cultural goods, artistic practice
based upon sampling, upon reworking found objects. The there is simply
the art of junk.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

Folded Time and Space

<p>
How do we contextualize this "kipple"?
<p>
In <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, Stewart Brand explores the different
rates at which different parts of buildings change over time.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
He divides a building into different layers, borrowing from and adapting
design theorists. Each of these layers changes at a different rate from
the others. He calls these layers the "six S's":

<ul>
<li> SITE: This is the geographical setting, the urban location, and the
generally defined lot, whose boundaries and context outlast generations
of ephemeral buildings.</li>
<li> STRUCTURE: The foundation and load-bearing elements are perilous
and expensive to change, so people don't change them. These <i>are</i>
the building. Structural life ranges from thirty to three hundred years
(but few buildings make it past sixty, for other reasons).</li>
<li>  SKIN: Exterior surfaces now change every twenty years or so, to keep
up with fashion or technology, or for wholesale repair. Recent focus
on energy costs has led to reengineered skins that are airtight and
better-insulated.</li>
<li>  SERVICES: These are the working guts of a building: communications
wiring, electrical wiring, plumbing, sprinkler system, HVAC (heating,
ventilating, and air conditioning), and moving parts like elevators
and escalators. They wear out or obsolesce every seven to fifteen
years. Many buildings are demolished early if their outdated systems
are too deeply embedded to replace easily.</li>
<li>  SPACE PLAN: The interior layout&#x02014;where walls, ceilings, floors,
and doors go. Turbulent commercial space can change every three years
or so; exceptionally quiet homes might wait thirty years.


<b></b>
</li>

<li>  STUFF: Chairs, desks, phones, pictures; kitchen appliances, lamps, hair
brushes; all the things that switch around daily to monthly. Furniture
is called <i>mobilia</i> in Italian for good reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Brand illustrates his points with several sequences of photographs of
buildings taken over the better part of a century. We observe how the
overall structures of buildings remain the same while decoration and
objects appear, move around, and vanish. He notes both the small changes
in detail and the big structural changes. But we have another example
in mind. In George Pal's 1960 version of <i>The Time Machine,</i>
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
there is a scene that nicely illustrates these layers. Our hero straps
himself into his machine, and watches as objects in the room flit around
thanks to the miracle of stop-motion photography. Items move around
the room. In a shop window across the street, a mannequin changes
clothes at high speed to match the passing seasons&#x02014;not natural
seasons but those of the fashion industry. But in addition to this,
other changes occur at a slower pace: the windows are boarded up,
the building collapses, woods grow around him.
<p>
The question becomes, how are we to represent and make sense of
this? Archaeological reports deal with only one moment in the life cycle
of their artifacts: the moment of rediscovery. In <i>Civilization and Its
Discontents,</i> Freud briefly touches on the difficulties of representing
temporality in a cityscape.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Now let us, by a flight of imagination, suppose that Rome is not a human
habitation but a psychical entity with a similarly long and copious
past&#x02014;an entity, that is to say, in which nothing that has once
come into existence will have passed away and all the earlier phases of
development continue to exist alongside the latest one . . . Where the
Coliseum now stands we could at the same time admire Nero's vanished
Golden House. On the Piazza of the Pantheon of to-day, as it was
bequeathed to us by Hadrian, but, on the same site, the original edifice
erected by Agrippa; indeed the same piece of ground would be supporting
the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the ancient temple over
which it was built.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
He concludes that, "If we want to represent historical sequence in spatial
terms we can only do it by juxtaposition in space: the same space cannot
have two different contents."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
(How striking that Freud should compare the mind to a city, when the
journeys that J. G. Ballard's characters make into ruins are really
metaphors for psychic journeys, e.g., in <i>The Drowned World</i>,
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<i>Hello America.</i>
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
How striking that Freud should choose Rome as his exemplar, when Rome
played such a key role in <i>The Last Man</i>'s final journey.)
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
It is impossible to trace the constant circulation and shifting
structures that Pal's film managed to depict by traditional
archaeological means. And this is why we must take shortcuts.
<p>
The twentieth-century avant-garde critique of the gallery juxtaposes
contemporary found, ready-made, appropriated objects with a space
conventionally reserved for antique art. A space-time machine is an
appropriate image in this field of archaeological garbage, for both ruins
and junkyards compress space and time into a single point&#x02014;artifacts
from different times and places are brought into one location, to be


<b></b>


(re)discovered. In a similar way, Robert Crossley has suggested that
the museum in science fiction "invites the reader to become a tourist
and to peer into the glass case in wonder and often alarm at an object
that collapses distances of time and space, disorients and displaces
the observer, and ultimately requires us to put ourselves right again."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<p>
Before the modern form of the museum emerged in the nineteenth century,
Mary Shelley was forced to employ the whole of Rome's ruins in order
to meditate on the nature of human achievement; seventy years later,
H. G. Wells was able to present his readers with the remains of a museum
modeled on London's Natural History Museum.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
In the museum gallery, we see objects and remains brought from
throughout the world's history and geography to be put on display. In the
ruined city, we encounter layers of accumulated debris from collapsing
buildings. In the junkyard and landfill, a hybrid of the two&#x02014;layers
of accumulated objects and remains from all over a city.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Revelations and Connections
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
So, in ruined city, junkyard, and museum we can expect to find
incongruity, the unexpected. There is often some humor for the modern
audience as their imaginary descendants fail to grasp, or miss completely,
an artifact's significance. We can look to David Macaulay and John Ames
Mitchell for extreme examples. David Macaulay describes an archaeological
excavation in the remains of the long lost civilization of "Usa." Here
the excavator recovers a double-chambered burial, exotic plastic
headdresses and jewelry, and the shrine to a mysterious deity. From
Macaulay's illustrations, <i>we</i> recognize a motel room and its en
suite bathroom, lavatory seat and brushes, and a television set.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Mitchell has Khan-Li reconstruct a street scene from ancient
Nh&#x000AF;u-Yok based on nineteenth-century advertising plates. A circus
performer rides down the street standing on the back of her horse,
while a baby waddles down in the other direction&#x02014;wearing only a top
hat. In the foreground is a toga-clad man with umbrella and, on his arm,
a respectable-looking lady in Victorian corset and the frame for a dress.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Discombobulation. Time is put out of joint.
<p>
But it need not be a ruined city. In the gesture of dada, in the
surrealist juxtaposition, there is an analogous folding of time and space
that emphasizes the accidental encounter. The urban experience of Louis
Aragon represented in his <i>Paysan de Paris</i>
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
is centered upon such encounter&#x02014;<i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>. Joseph
Cornell's boxes take us into an interior world of personal association
through incidental artifacts and objects, apparently worthless junk,
recombined in analogues of the museum display case, and acquiring
iconic significance.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
The Semiotic Fragment
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
The focus of this play around worthlessness, the value of aura and
association, is often upon the semiotic fragment, an item that comes to
stand for a great deal.
<p>
<i>From The Freud Museum</i> (1991 and after) was an installation
(variously exhibited) based upon Susan Hiller's artist's residency at
the Freud Museum in London. The work consisted of a large number of
objects in boxes that were presented in a series of


<b></b>


museum vitrines. Each box contained a combination of objects: "my starting
points were artless, worthless artifacts and materials&#x02014;rubbish,
discards, fragments, trivia and reproductions&#x02014;which seem to carry
an aura of memory and to hint at meaning something, something that made
me want to work with them and on them."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
She was fascinated by the idea of collecting as evinced in the rooms of
the house; where each object had been, carefully and with great pleasure,
registered and noted by Freud, and she took the idea of the narratives
inherent in the "conscious conration" of objects as the basis for the
project. Each component display box "presents the viewer with the word
(each is titled), a thing or object, and a representation" from which
multiple relationships are generated in the act of viewing and reading.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Categories Questioned
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
The assemblages of Cornell and Hiller raise questions of
categorization&#x02014;how do we box things (sometimes literally)&#x02014;as
junk, or collectable, meaningless, meaningful.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Implicit is the archaeological re of the collector, agent of
discovery, assemblage and classification. Peter Greenaway's curatorial
projects
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
use a variation upon this re, as he rummages through the store rooms
of museums, turning up what has been neglected, finding new meaning in
the recomposition of assemblages of artifacts, and people.

The World Trade Center&#x02014;Archaeologically Revisited
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Much of what we have been discussing under this theme of garbage
and archaeology is an aspect of industrial and modern urban
consciousness, with all its contradictions between rural/urban,
development/underdevelopment, management/laissez-faire, order/anarchy,
high culture/low culture, manufacture and design/organic process. Here
garbage is a matter of relationships negotiated between hygiene and
disease, matter in place and matter displaced, what is to be kept and
cherished for the future, what is to be discarded on the midden of
history. We emphasize how the notion of garbage, in its archaeological
field of association, is intimately tied to utopian thinking&#x02014;what
would it be like if we didn't have garbage and everything it represents,
if it were picturesque ruin, if there were no urban dereliction, if we
could hold on to the past and not let it slip away into rot, if we could
build upon the ruin of our heritage. A new World Trade Center is planned
to rise from the ruins of the old (consigned to a landfill site)&#x02014;a
new building that will represent a vision of a desired future.
<p>
We can refine the proposition with which we set out. Archaeology's
object is garbage and most people have not been able to deal with this,
seeing it (implicitly perhaps) as an embarrassment, preferring instead
a utopian thinking focused as much on (ethical) ideals of the good life
(the way society should be, the values of cultural achievement in the
past) as upon historical realities.
<p>
But whatever the denial at the core of the garbage conundrum, as we have
termed it, there is a fascination with garbage. Fragments evoke a range
of archaeological gratifications


<b></b>


and comforts that appear in the responses to 9/11, as much as in the
literature, movies, and fine arts we discuss above. Here little scraps
unlock bigger pictures and understandings.
<p>
The task is to reconnect these gratifications with concepts of
garbage. But the key seems to necessitate a degree of shock and
estrangement, even trauma. We might ask how much the building designed
to replace the destroyed and displaced World Trade Center will represent
simply a memorial comfort to the living rather than seizing an opportunity
to play upon the frictions and ironies of the archaeological materiality
that is the stuff of history.

middle range theory (of this relationship between behavior and its

Introduction

</h3>

<p>
Archaeology, as an academic discipline and as a means of addressing
the past, is a phenomenon that emerged in the modern era. For many
commentators this is because some specific aspect of the modern experience
has facilitated or promoted the study of the material traces of the
past. These might include the rise of an educated and affluent middle
class; improvements in transport, which rendered the antiquities of the
countryside accessible; or the construction of canals and railways, and
the consequent exposure of buried deposits. However, in this contribution
I will argue that the link between archaeology and modernity is more than
circumstantial. Indeed, I will suggest that modern philosophy, modern
forms of political organization, and modern social practices represent
the ground of the possibility of "doing archaeology." I will hope to
demonstrate that in some senses archaeology distills a modern sensibility,
embodying conceptions of time, humanity, nature, and science that have
been widely adopted over the past half-millennium. It is distinctive
of the modern world that philosophy and science, while representing
the discourses of specialized professionals, have contributed much to
the everyday rationality routinely employed by lay people. This is in
part because philosophy and science partake of a "ground plan" or set
of fundamental assumptions that is hard to fully articulate, and is
therefore metaphysical.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Archaeology, perhaps as much as any other discipline, is steeped in
the implicit and explicit presuppositions of modern thought.
<p>
This argument presents us with a series of paradoxes. The project of
archaeology, which uses material evidence to investigate


<b></b>


both prehistory and the historic past, is distinctively modern, and is
often understood to involve a kind of conversation between different
cultural or temporal horizons. Yet the very conditions that predispose
us to work in this way, and encourage us to believe that a knowledge
of the past is valuable, make it more difficult for us to comprehend
that past. For the burden of my case is that the worlds that we address
through archaeology are often ones in which archaeology would itself
be inconceivable. One of the most distinctive characteristics of
modernity has been the decline of tradition, and the corresponding
growth of "mechanical" forms of social integration, such as state
institutions. While traditional communities often have a knowledge of
the past which is transmitted orally between the generations, and which
is integral to social relations as a consequence, modern institutions
require legitimation by reference to an empirically validated past.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This relation of exteriority to the past was one of the critical elements
in the creation of archaeology. Equally important was the recognition
that the past was different from the present in significant ways. It
has often been pointed out that modern societies are <i>futural,</i>
and that philosophical ideas take on the role of legislating and planning
for the future in modernity.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The search for perfection in the future is pursued through the design
of objects and institutions, and through establishing new foundations
for thought and action.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Such a directional, nonreversible view of history implies a past in
which contemporary technologies and social arrangements were less
strongly developed.
<p>
Conventional histories of archaeology often point to activities that
prere the practice of excavation: Nabonidus's diggings in the
temple of Larsa, classical Greek openings of earlier tombs, or Bishops
Earldred and Eadmar's recovery of building stone from St. Albans in the
eleventh century <small>A.D.</small> But it is important to distinguish
between <i>addressing the archaeological,</i> in the sense of recovering
ancient artifacts for use as treasure or raw materials, and <i>practicing
archaeology</i>. The latter requires the understanding that these objects
can be studied in such a way as to generate new knowledge about people who
are no longer present, and the development of an appropriate inferential
framework. The need for this kind of knowledge was minimal during the
Middle Ages in the West, where the dominant view of history was linear,
yet extended between the Creation and the Judgment. The belief that the
last days were at hand was widespread, and the Bible's authoritative view
of the past was that it was to be measured in a few generations, and
had not differed from the present in social or technological terms. By
contrast, Renaissance scholars were more likely to argue that human
beings were able to change their own conditions of existence by action,
thereby bringing about historical change.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet this emphasis on human action was held in check by the powerful
influence of teleology, and the attendant notion of the world as a
kind of integrated body or organism. Michel Foucault has described the
holistic conception of knowledge that prevailed within this cosmology:
all things contained meaning and moral value, and all were networked
together by connotation, sympathy, reflection and metaphor.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
All phenomena gravitated to their appropriate place in the world
according to their moral worth, and the imbricated totality was
continually in motion as each entity progressed toward its immaterial
ideal form. Where this tendency toward


<b></b>


the telos was conceived as the principal cause of change in the universe,
human acts were understood as "efficient causes," and were thus thought
relatively inconsequential.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Nonetheless, the Renaissance enthusiasm for the classical world had
inspired an appreciation of the difference of the past. This chimed with
the humanist recognition of human diversity, even if historical change was
often understood in terms of a continuous decline of human faculties since
ancient times. The new attention paid to the classical past gave rise to
the practices of antiquarianism, specifically the collection of ancient
artifacts, and also to Marsilio Ficino's rediscovery of Plato. The latter
would revive a mathematical conception of the world, in time providing a
challenge to the dominant influence of Aristotelianism. Teleology was
also to be confronted by a growing emphasis on individuality during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In their quite different ways,
Erasmus would stress free rational action and creativity, while Luther
developed a vision of the subject as wholly responsible before God for
his or her own salvation.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet both were to contribute to an intellectual climate in which
personal action was placed above traditional authority and dogma. The
consequence would be the Council of Trent, with its restatement of
papal infallibility and the unquestionable character of the Church's
teachings. Stephen Toulmin has elegantly demonstrated that it was the
political, philosophical, and religious strife and instability of the
later seventeenth and earlier eighteenth centuries that gave rise to a
new desire for stability, truth, and certainty, which was manifested
in rationalist philosophy and its confluence with empiricism in the
Scientific Revolution.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the challenge to
monarchic rule seen in the English Civil War, brought about a reaction
against humanist skepticism and pluralism. But from the point of view of
the argument being developed here the eventual creation of archaeology
depended equally upon the acknowledgement of the importance of human
agency and its products (artifacts, architecture and institutions), and
the attitudes to evidence and materiality that were to be established
in the Scientific Revolution. The specificity of archaeology is such
that it was not a product of a single intellectual tradition, but of
the contingent relations between what were in some cases opposed ways
of thinking.

<h3>

Order and epistemology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
From the seventeenth century onward, scholarship was increasingly
connected with the state, while religion was to some extent compromised
by its identification as a source of fraternal strife. Learning had a
growing role in the construction and maintenance of political authority,
and this was particularly the case with history and antiquarianism. Where
rulers like Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden sought to create bureaucratic
and managerial monarchies, rather than rely upon divine right and
dynastic inheritance, they began to provide patronage for antiquaries
such as Johan Bure. Bure's investigations of early medieval rune-stones
effectively documented the early history of the Swedes, providing a
grounding identity for the new nation-state.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
This imperative to create historical foundations for the modern state
can be compared to the contemporary drive to establish a secure ground
for knowledge. The two separate strands


<b></b>


that were to contribute to this project, Baconian empiricism and
Cartesian rationalism, shared a wish to reconstruct science from
first principles. In the case of Francis Bacon, it was to be the
immediate sensory experience of things that would provide a starting
place. Innumerable experiments and observations should be catalogued
to form a universal natural history, which would in time give humanity
dominion over nature.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
This argument overturned the Renaissance belief that since humanity
was in decline, all worthwhile knowledge existed in the writings of
the ancient authors.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
By insisting that new knowledge, not contained in any book, could be
created through the experience of material things, Bacon was putting
in place one of the prerequisite elements of any archaeology. At the
same time, Bacon's view that the incremental growth of human knowing
was the means to progress was, once refined by Hobbes and Locke, to
contribute to a historical narrative of social and technical evolution
through the application of reason.
<p>
Ren&#x000E9; Descartes's approach to refounding knowledge was to
concentrate on pure, abstract reason, while doubting everything
else. Descartes held reasoning to be an innate capacity, given to
humanity by God, and therefore more reliable than the sense-evidence
focused on by Bacon. Where Renaissance scholars had explored connections
and resemblances, Descartes mistrusted appearances and sought to reduce
reality to its elemental forms in mathematics and geometry. This demanded
measurement and comparison, and the division of any complex entity into
its component parts in order to render it comprehensible. Ironically,
Descartes's means of rescuing human knowledge from skepticism was by
way of skepticism itself, cutting away any supposition that could not be
proven until he arrived at the rock-solid certainty that if a person is
aware of her own thinking, her real existence is guaranteed. One cannot be
tricked or deluded into thinking that one is thinking. Descartes takes
consciousness as his foundation, and works outward to reestablish a
method for investigating the world. This had a number of implications:
conscious reason was understood as being the essence of humanity;
epistemology gained priority over all other forms of knowing; whatever
could be known was to be known by a human subject.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Christianity had put in place a cosmology in which human beings were
possessed of immortal souls, and inhabited a transient world that
would be replaced by the coming of the kingdom of heaven. In contrast
with the ancient Greek conception of mortals in an eternal world,
this had established the view that creation was at the disposal of
humankind. Descartes's philosophy built on this perspective by presenting
humans as privileged interpreters of reality. Humanity now found itself
at the center of a world to which it gave a structure. This view would
be elaborated by Hobbes and Locke, who saw the universe as composed
only of particular things, while order was imposed on it by human reason.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
While Renaissance thinkers had seen themselves as exploring the
resemblances and associations that permeated creation, from this time
onward the role of the scholar was one of classification and ordering.
<p>
From the point of view of archaeology, Descartes's influence was most
profound in the role that he afforded to epistemology. Once one has
argued that verifiable knowledge rests upon the subject's self-certainty
and free will, while the material world


<b></b>


behaves according to invariant laws, the most fundamental problem of
philosophy is that of how the mind can apprehend physical things.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
In this way of thinking the goal of any investigation is the
representation of phenomena in the mind, and the purpose of epistemology
is to make sure that reconstruction is achieved without the distortions
wrought by prejudice and superstition. By implication, a coherent and
uniform method has priority over any specific question that we might
wish to ask concerning worldly phenomena: any particular understanding is
secondary to the problem of the possibility of knowledge in general. This
has meant, firstly, that the apprehension of the world through perception
has been identified as a difficulty, and secondly that the positioning
of a generalized methodology before any specific engagement with material
things has become a virtually unquestionable assumption.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
This privileging of epistemology values a universalized and
decontextualized logic over the particular or the contingent. It also
construes knowing as a procedure, which can be conducted in a right or a
wrong way, and which produces meaning out of things that are themselves
without meaning.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
The position of epistemology as first philosophy is virtually constitutive
of archaeology. The typological classification of artifacts and
their chronological ordering through seriation, the construction of
regional chronologies and stylistic sequences, the plotting of spatial
distributions and the definition of "culture groups" all depend upon
the view that an abstract method should be applied to entities before
they are rendered meaningful. Indeed, following Descartes, these are all
methodological procedures that fragment a relational world into discrete
objects in order to render it malleable. In the "culture-historic"
archaeology that dominated the discipline in both Europe and the Americas
throughout the first half of the twentieth century the rigorous definition
of traits, phases, components, and culture-groups on the basis of the
stylistic variation of material culture was understood as a purely
descriptive exercise.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
This methodical enterprise was nonetheless presumed to give the
archaeologist access to real sociocultural entities that had existed in
the past. Assemblages of pots could be equated with past "peoples." The
assumption here was that human beings always divide themselves into
bounded communities identifiable through mutually exclusive artifactual
repertoires. When culture-history came under attack from a generation
of more anthropologically oriented archaeologists in the United States
during the 1940s, it was on the grounds that archaeology needed greater
epistemological refinement. Revealingly, Walter Taylor was to argue that
archaeology is not exclusively related to either history or anthropology.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Rather, archaeology is simply a methodology which can be used in the
service of either discipline. By implication, archaeology is a technology
for the extraction of data, which can be absolutely distinguished from
the attribution of meaning that might be performed at a later stage by
anthropologists or historians.
<p>
Taylor's call for archaeologists to refound their discipline by returning
to epistemological first principles is characteristic of modern thought,
carrying echoes of both Locke's wish to clear the ground for new
understandings and the early pronouncements of logical positivism. The
same imperative was restated by the "New Archaeology" of the 1960s,
which set out to create a new foundation for the discipline, separating


<b></b>


the discovery of archaeological remains from their evaluation, and in
the process removing subjectivity from archaeological reasoning.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Far the most profound thinker in this school, Lewis Binford has spent
much of his career constructing ways of assessing the significance
of statements about the past. While early practitioners of the New
Archaeology attempted to apply the hypothetico-deductive method to
their arguments, Binford was to point out that hypotheses about the
past could not be tested on material evidence in the present.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
The past is not available for testing. Binford's eventual answer to
the problem lay in "middle range theory," which sought to typify the
signatures of mechanical and physical processes observable in the
archaeological record on the basis of observations and experiments
in the present. He described this process as one of giving meaning
to archaeological observations, the implication of which is that
archaeological evidence in the present is simply dead, meaningless
matter.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Moreover, this approach construes events (the butchering of an animal;
the breaking of a pot) in an atomized way, as context-free happenings
that bring about discrete material outcomes.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Crucially, both the New Archaeology of the 1960s and Binford's more
recent work follow the Cartesian formula of constructing methods in
abstraction, while understanding that meaning only arrives on the scene
when the analysis is complete.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Artifacts, atomism, and the social contract
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Bacon's argument that new knowledge could be created from things
was to have a critical significance for the way that artifacts were
understood, including those deriving from the distant past. If objects
were the equivalent of books that could be studied, rather than
simply representing illustrative examples of phenomena, collections
of things might be compared to libraries. This is the conception that
lies behind the modern museum. In this sense the museum was a product
of the seventeenth century, but histories of archaeology have tended to
underestimate the importance of the Renaissance "cabinets of curiosity"
that predated museums. While the significance of personal collections
that occasionally contained antiquities is acknowledged, cabinets are
sometimes dismissed as haphazard and disordered. In particular, they
generally failed to discriminate between cultural artifacts and "natural"
geological and biological samples. This neglects the point that cabinets
were often structured according to an Aristotelian system of knowledge,
in which entities were connected by sympathy, allegory, correspondence,
and reflection rather than typology and tabulation.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Cabinets of curiosity represented a microcosm of the world at large,
and in some cases were even understood as an apparatus for the practice
of a form of sympathetic magic. The emergence of museums thus amounts
to a transformation of the cultural practice of collecting, but was
also a symptom of a shift to a modern mode of knowing, which changed
the status of artifacts. This change was crucial for the development
of archaeology in its contemporary form.
<p>
If the cabinet was an array of objects that one could manipulate from
within, the museum was a world-picture, whose order could be appreciated
from without. Museums were increasingly organized according to what
Foucault describes as the table or


<b></b>


grid, the dominant re of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
knowledge.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Taxonomic classification emerged as a means by which the order of
nature could be made apparent: an imposition of human reason upon
nature, which nonetheless betrayed the first glimmer of a suspicion
that there might be underlying structures beneath the visible surface
of reality. Significantly, Edward Lhwyd, one of the early keepers of the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, developed a typological ordering of fossils,
which he later applied to antiquities.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Once the classificatory table had replaced a holistic vision of nature,
it was more than likely that a typology of artifacts would develop,
as the work of Caylus and Winckelmann was to demonstrate.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
If museums provided the context for the identification of ancient
artifacts as nodes within a classificatory grid, seventeenth-century
thought inclined more generally to the view that objects were
free-standing entities which logically preceded any structure in which
they were implicated. This facilitated a mechanical conception of the
universe such as that of Newton, in which a single set of laws applied
to all phenomena throughout the cosmos.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
This mechanism insisted that material things cannot move themselves:
there is no tendency toward a telos and only external causality. The
isolation of material things as autonomous entities fits closely with the
removal of meaning from the physical world. Things are not inherently
meaningful, and meaning is created in the mind. The valorization of a
knowledge that was decontextualized and universal can be seen as part
of the project of severing it from religion, politics, and ethics.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The supposed universality of the ideas of the new science and the new
philosophy indicated that the same kinds of regularities that had been
identified in nature might also be found in human societies.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
As a consequence, arguments about the human past that can present
themselves as scientific and value-free have been able to claim a degree
of legitimacy, while those that address questions of ethics, legality
or aesthetics have been placed on a par with rhetoric, superstition and
fantasy. These arguments continue to be rehearsed today, with claims for
the absolute separation of science from other forms of archaeological
knowledge.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The first manifestation of a Newtonian conception of human relations is
found in the "social physics" of Hobbes and Locke. Here, the singular
human being is envisaged as the social atom, who is a fully formed agent
before his insertion into the social field. This means that society is a
kind of contract, an artificial arrangement constructed by human beings,
and it follows that it can be redesigned for the better. This is what we
would now describe as "social engineering." While the notion of a "social
contract" is one that goes back to classical times, its articulation
by Hobbes in <i>Leviathan</i> , and the quite different version
presented by Rousseau , have been singularly influential in the
development of modern political ideas.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Most importantly, the growth of the nation-state as the characteristic
political formation of modernity has involved a change from sovereign
rule to government as a management of populations that has required a
degree of consent.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
The designed and managed state has both drawn on and contributed to
the philosophy of social contract, and has generated the widespread
expectation that national identities, bounded territories, a
shared language or culture, and state organization, should all be
congruent. That is to say, the belief in a





sutured and internally homogeneous ethnic or political community, which
can be retrospectively imposed on the past, is in part a product of
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political philosophies. We have
seen that the existence of such units in the distant past has been
a fundamental assumption of particular forms of archaeology. Equally
important, though, has been the way in which these ideas concerning the
"naturalness" of bounded "peoples," and the belief in their existence
in a golden age in the past, contributed to the creation of popular
nationalism at the start of the nineteenth century.
<p>
We have already seen that once the monarchs of Europe began to cast
themselves as the chief executive of the nation-state they could no
longer rely on their dynastic inheritance for legitimacy, and turned
instead to the historical authenticity of the political community. The
role of the early antiquarians in substantiating the early histories of
the European nations was not a precocious nationalism, but scholarship in
the service of the state. By contrast, the archaeology of the nineteenth
century drew upon and was promoted by the notion of a "national past,"
which occasionally played against the interests of the ruling classes by
demanding the preservation of ancient monuments and relics. Nationalism
essentializes the past, seeking an origin for the present in a
prelapsarian state of pristine ethnic uniformity. Nationalism generally
presents itself as being hostile to new-fangled, cosmopolitan, hybrid,
miscegenatory modernity. It celebrates tradition and the wholesome
peasant existence of the imagined past, and yet it is a profoundly
modern phenomenon.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Archaeology has supported this agenda by helping to construct idealized
pasts. However, while some authorities have presented nationalism
as a layer of distortion that has been imposed onto the evidence by
practitioners with an atavistic bias,
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
this view represents a retreat into a belief that "the truth about the
past" can be readily separated from interests and prejudices. Even at a
methodological level, archaeology is permeated by modernist assumptions
regarding the character of the past, as we have seen in the case of
culture-history.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
It is worth pointing out that the "processual," ecological, functionalist
archaeologies of the 1960s and 1970s were equally attached to the
notion of "societies" or "communities" as naturally occurring human
units, which existed in an adaptive and homeostatic relationship with
their environments. This conception is equally indebted to the social
philosophies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Reason, progress, and metanarratives
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
That the Newtonian framework could be generalized to cover human
society was axiomatic for the Enlightenment, which built on Locke's
belief that knowledge is acquired and Descartes's emphasis on free will
and the exercise of reason to claim that humans can transform their own
conditions of existence and achieve worldly perfection. The acquisition
of greater understanding is thereby a route toward social progress. For
Enlightenment philosophers like Voltaire, reason was universal, and all
human beings were equally capable of perfecting their rational conduct,
providing that the shackles of tradition, authority and superstition
can be cast aside. Yet the implication


<b></b>


of this argument is that there is a single universal condition and
type of society that all human beings should aspire to, that human
diversity is superficial, and that Western civilization is superior to
any traditional society. This amounts to a denial of human finitude,
the condition of being positioned in contingent circumstances as the
mortal inheritor of a particular cultural tradition. Many would insist
that this is actually the source of our humanity.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Given the diversity of humankind in the present and the possibility
of perfection in the future, Enlightenment thinkers proposed a series
of conjectural historical sequences by which humanity might be in
the process of progressing from savagery to civilization. In most
cases these replaced the Christian narrative of the fall from grace
followed by salvation with a story of the progressive freeing of the
human individual from the state of nature.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
These philosophical histories were often stadial in character, composed
of progressive phases of savagery, barbarism and civilization, or hunting,
pastoralism, agriculture, and commerce.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Implicitly or explicitly, such schemes suggested the progressive
evolution of technology over time.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
These arguments were constructed entirely in isolation from any material
evidence, but they nonetheless provided the inspiration for Christian
Thomsen's organization of the material in the collection of the Royal
Commission of Danish Ancient Monuments in Copenhagen into finds from
the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This was the first use of the
"three age system" in archaeology.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
A less obvious way in which Enlightenment conceptions of history have
been critical to archaeology has been in the distinction between history
and nature. While historical change was directional, nature was, until
the beginning of the nineteenth century, generally considered to be
inert. Consequentially, human progress depended upon an escape from the
state of nature at some time in the past, resulting in a preoccupation
with origins. This still casts a shadow over archaeology, where "the
origins of anatomically modern humans," "the origins of the human mind,"
and "the origins of agriculture" remain topics of debate.
<p>
The fixity of nature began to come into question in the later eighteenth
century, when biologists like Buffon started to argue that the physiology
of animal species can change over time. Foucault has pointed to the
particularly important role that Cuvier played in replacing the view
that creatures were place-holders within a massive classificatory table
with an emphasis on the functional character of anatomy and the behavior
of animals.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
This introduced a discontinuity into nature, while indicating that there
were important aspects of the character of creatures which could not be
ascertained from their surface morphology. After Cuvier it was easier
for the notion of biological evolution to develop, and with it a dynamic
conception of nature. A natural world that was constantly in motion
threatened to displace the division between culture and nature, but the
conceptual danger was overcome by distinguishing between "processual"
change (which might be cyclical) and historical change (which remained
directional and irreversible). Within archaeology this has led to some
confusion over the particular kind of change that characterizes specific
phenomena in the past. For instance, does the development from hunting
and gathering to herding and cultivation constitute a "natural" or a
"historical" process? In practice, different generations of





archaeologists have argued for either option at different
times. Occasionally, archaeologists have sought to collapse history into
nature, effectively echoing the materialism of Gassendi and La Mettrie.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
A spectacular example of this is found in the "palaeoeconomy" school
of the 1960s, which argued that all prehistoric developments could be
understood using the conceptual tools of animal ethology and ecological
succession.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

Archaeology appears to be addicted to metanarratives, whether historical
or processual in character. These might concern themselves with the
rise of the state, the descent of <i>homo sapiens,</i> the development
of metallurgy, or the growth of urban society, but in each case they
propose that history can be understood as a seamless directional flow,
made comprehensible through the trajectory of a single variable. In this
respect, the visions of history that stem from the Enlightenment have the
modern characteristic of seeking to reduce ambiguity and impose patterned
order. Yet it is also arguable that the experience of modernity is one
of increasing heterogeneity, hybridity, and instability.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Modern science and philosophy sought to separate human knowledge from
human interests, thereby guaranteeing its objectivity. But developments
in the twentieth century appear to have undercut this project. In
the First World War the emergence of military technologies that far
outstripped the capabilities of the strategists into whose hands
they had been placed (mustard gas, tanks, railways, heavy artillery,
aircraft) gave rise to concerns over the social role of science. The
result was a series of initiatives to cleanse, evaluate or refound
scientific and academic practice: logical positivism, critical theory,
and transcendental phenomenology. Yet this "crisis of knowledge" was less
profound than that which followed the Second World War, and in particular
the Holocaust. Given that a highly civilized and technologically
sophisticated nation had undertaken systematically to murder part of
its population, using the full resources of bureaucracy and science,
the belief that the Western world was moving inexorably toward universal
perfection was difficult to sustain. Indeed, Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Lyotard
has identified the principal characteristic of a postmodern era as an
"incredulity toward metanarratives."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
After Auschwitz it is impossible to believe in universal progress. This
raises an important question for archaeology: where does its own
predilection for grand narratives stand in this new intellectual climate?

Interiority and the individual
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have seen that Cuvier's comparative anatomy established that the
outward appearance of an organism might not provide all of the salient
information about it. Foucault presents Cuvier's ideas in the context
of a more general explosion of "structural" thinking at around 1800
<small>A.D.</small>, which also encompassed the study of language and
the analysis of wealth.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
However, it is possible to argue that this horizon was prered by
a growing tension between the classificatory mode of knowing and a
developing sense of human interiority. Charles Taylor has suggested
that the notion of an "inner self" first developed within Christianity,
and was made explicit by Augustine.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Augustine proposed the inward turn into introspection as a way of
approaching God,


<b></b>


so that the truth is located deep within ourselves. Later, the inner world
became a space in which hidden desires might lurk, and which needed to
be carefully monitored through the confessional. Arguably, this concern
with interiority was elaborated in the modern era, in which human beings
came to be understood as having "two insides": a body interior composed of
organs and tissues, and a mind. This is very much what Heidegger refers to
when he describes the modern conception of the person as a creature "built
in layers"; a biological body to which a mind or soul has been added.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
On this view the mind is a separate entity from the body, and could
exist independently from and prior to it. There is an obvious parallel
between this Cartesian mind that precedes the body, and the Hobbesian
individual, who precedes his or her involvement in social relations.
<p>
Throughout much of the twentieth century archaeology has been dominated
by perspectives which emphasize the social whole. Culture-historic
archaeology relied upon the norms and values that are passed from
generation to generation, and collective identities rather than
human action, while the ecological functionalism of the 1960s and
1970s presented communities as adaptive totalities. Unfortunately, the
eventual reaction against these views has involved the identification of
the autonomous individual as a universal category. Recent arguments have
argued that the individual is a self-contained, embodied consciousness,
and have advocated the identification of distinct personalities and
biographies in the past.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
One might object that "individuality" is in any case only a cultural
fiction of modernity, a condition to which modern Westerners aspire,
even if complete personal autonomy is a practical impossibility. Given
the strong ethnographic evidence that many people neither understand
themselves nor act as "individuals,"
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
the concept is one which may be both anachronistic and ethnocentric
when applied to the distant past. However, the way in which a model
of the person that grew up in the period following the Renaissance
is so easily resorted to as an alternative to undifferentiated social
totalities again points to the way in which archaeology finds itself
immersed in modern ways of thinking.

Depth and surface
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
The vision of a body exterior containing a bundle of organs, or concealing
a mind, expresses a relationship between inside and outside which became
increasingly prevalent after 1800. Importantly, it was at precisely
this point that antiquarianism was transformed into archaeology. It is
broadly accepted that the innovation that enabled this change to take
place was the introduction of <i>stratification</i>.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
In geology, James Hutton's <i>Theory of the Earth</i>  and
William Smith's <i>Strata Identified by Organised Fossils</i> 
were together responsible for a view of the earth as continuously
changing through the actions of heat, pressure and weathering, and in the
process building up sequences of strata which contained chronologically
diagnostic fossil remains.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
The lesson that was learned from this was that the pattern of topography
could be understood through the stratified rocks beneath the surface,
just as the pathology of human bodies could be grasped by opening up
corpses. Archaeologists now began to appreciate


<b></b>


the sequences of events represented by the accumulation of layers of soil
and debris on ancient sites, and a relationship between the depth of time
and the depth of deposit became a critical element in the archaeological
imagination. It is of enormous significance that archaeology became
identifiable as a discipline at precisely the point when, according to
Foucault, "man" as a discursive object first appeared on the scene.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
"Man," in this sense, is what occurs when human beings cease to be one
species amongst others, and become the point at which biology, history,
and statecraft meet; at once an object of empirical observation,
a problem of population, order and management, and the knower of
knowledge. As such, "man" is the meeting point of historical process
and human finitude, and this is just what archaeology has concerned
itself with, from its earliest appearance. Archaeology identifies the
cultural works and physical remains of human beings, and places them in
the context of a temporal sequence established through a relationship
between depth and surface.
<p>
Fredric Jameson has argued that "depth models" are the hallmark of
modern thinking.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The examples that he provides include the relationship between speech
and grammar in structuralism, essence and appearance in Marxism,
authenticity and inauthenticity in existentialism, and superficial
reading versus deep meaning in hermeneutics. Perhaps because the
depths of the person are connected with the mind, the soul, and the
route to the deity, depth is often equated with profundity and surface
with superficiality. Archaeology was integral to the development of
this "depth thinking," and its embodiment of the recovery of hidden
truths from below the earth and from the distant past has provided
a powerful metaphor in other areas of thought. In this sense, the
idea of archaeology has been central to later modern thinking. This
metaphorical use of the concept of archaeology is possibly clearest in
the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud. Freud was an enthusiastic
collector of ancient artifacts, and was fascinated by the discoveries of
Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and Arthur Evans at Knossos. He compared the
task of the psychoanalyst to that of the archaeologist, clearing away
debris (the repression) in order to uncover neglected treasures. Freud
wrote often of the "depths" of the mind, and literally considered the
psychic apparatus to be stratified.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Just as successive occupation layers build up over time on an ancient
settlement, so the deeper layers of the id contained the collective
psychic history of the human race, which was recapitulated in the
suppression of sexual feelings for the parents and the formation of
the ego ideal.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Freud's "topographic" model of the mind equated stratigraphic depth
with the collective and the instinctual, and elsewhere in his work
there are connections between prehistory, myth, and the mental lives
of contemporary non-Western "primitives." It remains a burden that the
discipline has to contend with that depth and hiddenness are associated
with mystery, insight and truth. This undoubtedly colors the popular
conception of archaeology, but it also arguably has a role in the
valorization of various forms of archaeological research. Our field
practices are often geared toward the establishment of a linear temporal
sequence through the deposits on a site, working back toward a point
of origin. Equally, the uncovering and recovery of hidden deposits and
artifacts is sometimes held in greater esteem than the interpretation
and appreciation of ancient things that are already


<b></b>


fully visible. It is as if by bringing things into the light the
past itself is being recovered. Forms of archaeology that concern
themselves with that which is readily accessible (rock art, standing
buildings, industrial archaeology) sometimes struggle to attract the same
attention. Yet there is a real sense in which we inhabit a past that is
all around us, and the uncovering of hidden depths provides more evidence,
but not evidence of an ontologically different kind.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Mind, body, and substance
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have seen already that the seventeenth-century project of overcoming
ambivalence through rigorous method was connected with an increasing
separation of subject and object, and mind and body. As a result, the mind
came to be imagined as a space within which representations are generated,
quite distinct from worldly objects. At least for Descartes, the mind
was a thinking thing, quite different in kind from the substantial things
of the world. These formulations have given rise to views of materiality
and mentality which still dominate archaeology. In the first place, the
recent fashion for "cognitive archaeology," increasingly allied as it is
to cognitive psychology and directed toward explaining the "evolution
of the modern mind," rests on the belief that there is a discrete and
objective entity that we can call a mind. This mind can be observed
through the consequences of its functioning, which are manifested in
the archaeological record as the traces of problem-solving events.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Cognitive archaeology proposes that the mind is an information-processing
device, and has an "architecture" which appears to be only indirectly
related to that of the brain. As with Descartes's immaterial
consciousness, it is unclear where this mind resides (other than being
immanent in the brain), suggesting that it is a metaphysical concept.
<p>
For cognitive archaeologies, the mind is like a computer, which makes
the world intelligible by inputting atomized fragments of information
and processing them.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Yet there is an evident circularity about saying that the mind is
like a computer, when a computer is a device that has been created to
simulate the processes of thought (or rather, a limited selection of
them). What cognitive approaches neglect is that human beings do not
simply process information: they deal with significant phenomena in
a world of meaning. Only in a Cartesian world that has been declared
free of meaning does the notion of information processing make any
sense. Computers do not "have a world," they do not have background
practices, and they do not have shared skills and traditions.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
The way in which human beings operate in their contexts of significance
cannot be made explicit, cannot be represented, and cannot be reduced
to calculation.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Yet the forms of evolutionary psychology that are currently being used
to address the actions of early humans rely on the understanding that
the mind is an entity that has a particular form, which is a product of
natural selection, and which is more or less successful at performing
particular tasks.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

<p>
It is readily apparent that the division between mind and matter has
had a harmful effect on the way that we understand human beings in the
past. The implications of modern views of materiality are perhaps more
subtle. Where meaning has been banished


<b></b>


to the mind, the physical world comes to be understood as composed of
objects that have spatial extension and spatio-temporal motion; material
entities and the causal relations between them.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Once the world has been reduced to these terms, modern science is
highly successful in explaining the behavior of matter. However, what
this reduction demands is that all relationships between people and
things be object/subject relations, in which consciousness engages
with discrete entities. This is the mode of engagement that Heidegger
defines as "present-at-handness," where humans observe worldly things
in an objectified, distanced and disinterested way.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Crucially, there is another way in which people deal with things,
the ready-to-hand, in which we are barely aware of the entity at all,
and yet our relationship with it may be much closer and more profound
than gazing in an analytic fashion. Heidegger's classic example of the
ready-to-hand is the act of using a hammer to drive in a nail, in which
the hammer "recedes" from our notice in the act of hammering. It is
certainly easier to grasp this unthematized way of being with material
things in the case of a tool that withdraws into the project at hand, but
for the most part people "get on with things" in just this nonanalytic
way, and only occasionally stand back and contemplate objects from a
position of disengagement.
<p>
The problems that an atomistic conception of materiality sets up for
archaeology are profound. First, it points to one of the distinguishing
conditions of modernity: an attitude in which we understand our
surroundings as if they were composed of a series of free-standing
objects, which are at our disposal as resources to be used up. We
cannot assume that people in the deep past shared this attitude to the
world. Further, our ways of addressing prehistoric material culture are
overwhelmingly analytic: typology, seriation, measurement, quantification,
graphs, and distributions. But if our archaeology takes a form that is
principally analytic, objective, and scientific, we may learn very little
about the habitual, experiential, and involved character of everyday
life in the past. People in antiquity did not live their entire lives as
disengaged subjects, gathering information from abstract objects. They
dwelt in sensuous worlds of meaning, desire, suffering, and labor. It
is impossible to construct an understanding of the past on the basis
of artifacts and structures viewed as analytic objects and to hope to
somehow <i>unfold</i> a world of meaning out it. Meaning never arrives on
the scene as an afterthought, after the structures of material existence
have been put together.

Conclusion: Archaeology as ethical knowledge
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
In this article I have outlined some of the arguments made in my book
<i>Archaeology and Modernity</i>.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
In this abbreviated form, positions that were already broad-brush may
lack substantiation and nuance. However, the principal point that I have
been hoping to demonstrate is simply that archaeology is bound to the
modern condition at a variety of different levels. In some cases all that
is implied is that archaeologists have employed theories or frameworks
that are distinctively modern, or that their preconceptions have been
formed by the modern experience. This much could presumably be argued for
any discipline. But there is also a sense in which archaeology would be


<b></b>


inconceivable under other historical conditions. Archaeology emerged from
a nexus of modern ideas: the recognition of the difference of the past;
the replacement of teleology by a classificatory mode of knowledge;
the formulation of narratives of social and technological progress; the
rise of the belief that new knowledge can be made from material things;
the view of materiality that arose from superimposing the distinction
between mind and matter on that between form and matter; the emphasis on
depth models; and the belief in the naturalness of bounded human groups
that arose alongside the nation-state. This is why not all societies
practice archaeology.
<p>
Yet if archaeology could only have been generated in the context of the
modern world, where does that leave it today? It remains a matter of
debate whether we have entered a postmodern era, but if modernity were
indeed to have come to an end, would archaeology find itself moribund
and obsolete? Is the subject so intrinsically tied to a particular set of
conditions that it can only be of use (or interest) to a particular kind
of society? It is perhaps heartening that archaeology is undergoing a
phase of unprecedented interest in the media, but it could be suggested
that television programs on digs, mummies, and lost cities do no
more than feed a postmodern economy of groundless images and spectral
nostalgia. Could archaeology transform itself into a different kind of
discipline, to make itself significant to a new kind of world? Such an
idea immediately suggests the distinctively modern strategy of a return to
first principles, the creation of another set of new foundations. This
would certainly be inappropriate. A more modest proposal is that
although archaeology might not have come into being without modernity,
it could be changed by augmenting its present concerns with those kinds
of knowledge that modernist thought tends to excise: ethics, politics,
aesthetics and rhetoric. This is not so much a case of leaping onto a
postmodern bandwagon as of realizing a set of countermodern potentials.
<p>
That archaeology could be defined as ethical knowledge might appear
surprising. For decades, the discussion of "ethics in archaeology" has
been limited to questions of the propriety of excavating particular sites
as opposed to preserving them, professional standards of recording, the
trade in illicit antiquities, and so on. But it is also worth considering
that our relationship to the past people about whom we write is an ethical
one. Archaeology conventionally separates the present and the past, and
often considers its evidence (including human remains and the products of
human labor) to be meaningless until they have been interpreted. Moreover,
the people whom we study are dead, and feel neither pain nor shame. Yet
in using past human beings as the raw material for creating narratives of
historical process, we treat them as if they were fully comprehensible. It
makes little difference that the people that we study through archaeology
cannot look or speak back to us. If we reduce them to the atoms of a past
social system, or to rational foraging organisms, we subject them to a
totalizing logic. By failing to recognize that human lives exceed our
conceptual schemes, we do not learn from the past so much as organize it.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
This kind of totalization is close in spirit to totalitarianism. If
we find ourselves willing to organize the lives of people in the past
according to grand conceptual schemes, we are that much more likely to
find it acceptable to do the same to people in the present.


<b></b>


<p>
The ethical task of archaeology is to bear witness to the other human
being in his or her difference. However, modern ethical schemes have
tended to follow the Enlightenment belief in the universality of a
particular kind of humanity. Thus, they have focused on the definition of
universal rights. The alternative is to concentrate less on the autonomy
of universal individuals, but rather on the relational connectedness
that arises from difference.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Archaeology may have arisen from modernity, but it has the unique
capability to bring us into contact with lived worlds that are utterly
alien from our own, <i>even if they at one time occupied the same
space</i> as ourselves<i>.</i> This encounter gives us the possibility
of recognizing the particularity and contingency of our own way of
living. Learning more about the past expands our understanding of
ourselves, but it is essential that in doing so we recognize that there
is some element of the difference of the past other that will always
elude us.

Since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, historians have been rediscovering the American 1930s, particularly those artistic and cultural movements erased by conservative and even anti-communist forces during the years of the Cold War. Art critics have begun to take more seriously the effects of constructivism and Russian futurism upon avant-garde movements in Western Europe and in America; and literary scholars have begun to notice the imprint in the 1930s of Soviet genres such as that of the worker correspondent&#x02014;factory-floor testimonialsthat, during the 1920s and 1930s, surfaced repeatedly in Soviet theater productions, in newspaper columns, and in newsreels as well. Worker testimonials could be either spoken or written, but most of the examples that appeared in the U.S. in the early 1930s were literary ones, letters and poems, that filled out the pages of radical journals like <i>The New Masses</i>.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  With the introduction of recorded sound to Soviet cinema after 1930, however, films like Dziga Vertov's <i>Three Songs about Lenin</i>  began to feature the faces and voices of testifying workers.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In scenes like the one

The worker correspondent genre marks a fascinating local effort to redefine the social power of art. But because it hinged on the idea that clear vision and hence powerful speech are functions of one's position in a system of economic exploitation, it will probably always be more of a historical curiosity than a genuine force in American literature. Still, twentieth-century American poetry owes a deep and unacknowledged 

<b></b>

debt to the art forms that emerged during the first years of the Bolshevik Revolution. It was not just point-blank testimonials like this one from the young Dnieper Dam worker, but the artfully assembled newsreel films that contained them that affected the way American poets thought about the words they were using, and, more importantly, how montage methods of construction might be brought to bear on the ambitious long poems that they began to conceive during the 1930s and 1940s. 

<p>
Of the leading American poets of the 1930s and 1940s, Louis Zukofsky and William Carlos Williams were among those most influenced by early Soviet cinema. Both writers were either planning or executing epic poems during this period. Zukofsky began his "life-work," <i>"A"</i>, in "late 1927 or early 1928"; while Williams was struggling with "the manner and method" of <i>Paterson</i> as late as 1943.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Though they faced different challenges and followed different timelines, both were trying to imagine new forms for their long poems&#x02014;forms that would admit materials which had yet to be incorporated into the body of American literature. Due both to the influence upon American artists of Soviet newsreels and newsreel-style films, and to the questions that these films raised regarding truth and representation, Zukofsky and Williams shared a desire to make poems out of nonfictional textual materials. As a Marxist intellectual, Zukofsky was interested in the material of history; and he believed that, to be of moment, a modern epic would have to contain passages taken straight from <i>Das Kapital</i>, as well as "quotations" from "Hen[ry] Ford" "&#x02014;the words exactly his own" (<i>PZ</i>, 82).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Williams wrote <i>Paterson</i> during a later epoch, and his sense of history and the material of poetry differed accordingly. In his view, the very explicit political demands placed upon artists in the 1930s had bred in "present day audience[s]" a "natural" "antagonism to verse."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This was an antagonism that Williams himself sometimes shared. Devoting himself to novels, stories, and essays during that decade, he delayed work on <i>Paterson</i> until he was prompted, through discussions held in New York at the 1939 Third Writers' Congress, to think in new ways about how poetry might be wedded to documentary forms of expression.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 

<p>
Zukofsky and Williams were among the American poets most affected by Soviet cinema during the 1930s and 1940s; and Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov stood together as the leaders of two rival cinematic approaches emerging from a country that, beginning in 1926, produced a series of "full-to-bursting" "avant-garde" films. Eisenstein's <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>  and Vertov's <i>The Man with a Movie Camera</i>  headed a long list of "living photographs" that "changed the film world" after the political world had been "shaken" by "the October explosion of 1917."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Though Eisenstein and Vertov often disagreed in their public comments, the two shared an artistic as well as a political community through the pages of the Soviet avant-garde arts journal, <i>LEF</i>. Standing for "Left Front of the Arts," <i>LEF</i> was a small but influential magazine founded in 1923 by the futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. As Mayakovsky described it, <i>LEF</i> combined "the weapons of Futurism" with a brand of "constructivism" that owed more to "advertising" than to "aesthetics"; in gathering together this collection of arts movements, the journal attracted an unusually diverse and vibrant group of politically committed writers, visual artists, and filmmakers.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In 1927, the poet and 

<b></b>

playwright Sergei Tretyakov, himself a <i>LEF</i> editor, underscored the similarities amid the differences between Eisenstein's and Vertov's respective "fictional" and "nonfictional" approaches to film. "It has always seemed perfectly justified to me," Tretyakov wrote, "that there are both of these names on the cover of Lef&#x02014;Eisenstein and Vertov. These are men working for the same purpose, but with two different methods. With Eisenstein, the agitational impulse predominates, while the material shown takes an auxiliary position. With Vertov the informational impulse predominates and the material itself is most important."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Tretyakov's comparison provides a useful way of thinking about Soviet cinema in the 1920s because it suggests that the material or the actual footage used by filmmakers does not finally constitute the defining distinction between fiction and nonfiction film. Eisenstein's movies are staged, while Vertov's are spliced together in large part from pre-shot archival footage (<i>KE</i>, 45). And yet the differences in the <i>kinds</i> of footage that these filmmakers produced were less important than the aesthetic choices that determined the manner in which Eisenstein and Vertov assembled their respective materials. 

<p>
In his discussion of Eisenstein and Vertov as avant-garde filmmakers, Tretyakov implied that Soviet films should be categorized not on the basis of the materials from which they were constructed, but according to criteria that many would view as mutually exclusive: their political and formal objectives and strategies. Tretyakov reminds his readers that, for all of Eisenstein's celebrity as a technical innovator, the renowned director was also committed to the making of "agitational" or "propagandistic" films. Early films like <i>Strike</i>  and <i>Potemkin</i>  did indeed commemorate high points in the long path toward the Revolution of 1917. In the process they inspired the masses, arousing in them what Tretyakov classified as "emotional" sympathy for the Revolutionary cause ("SOSD," 36). By contrast, "intellectualizing" films like Vertov's <i>Kinopravda</i> newsreels  were more "instructional, documentary, scientific": they left the viewer "better educated" about the historical and theoretical processes of revolutionary change. The difference between the material used in Eisenstein's so-called "played" films, which were rooted in the theater, and that used in Vertov's "unplayed" films, which were rooted in everyday events, seemed less significant if both cinematic approaches&#x02014;fictional and nonfictional&#x02014;could be shown to have a social impact.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  By gauging the political weight of Eisenstein's and Vertov's played and unplayed avant-garde films, then, Tretyakov shifted the emphasis of filmmaking away from the material and toward the question of the filmmakers' larger objectives. He reconciled the two Revolutionists as participants in an overall collective enterprise; and in the process he opened the door for a discussion of the shared methods of construction that enabled Eisenstein and Vertov to serve together as members of an artistic, as well as a political, vanguard ("SOSD," 29).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 

<p>
Arguing that, fact or fiction, "it is all a matter of montage," Tretyakov followed the lead of another <i>LEF</i> contributor, the Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky ("SOSD," 29).<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  More even than Tretyakov, Shklovsky approached the distinction between fiction and nonfiction film by emphasizing methods of construction over the materials used by the filmmakers themselves.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Insofar as either Eisenstein or Vertov succeeded 

<b></b>

as filmmakers (and Shklovsky clearly preferred Eisenstein of the two), they did so not because they inspired or educated but because they discovered and utilized the modern technique of filmic montage ("SOSD," 32-3). In making his point regarding the importance of method to filmmaking, moreover, Shklovsky suggested that <i>poets</i> could imitate the work of Soviet filmmakers by using the sorts of materials that newsreel artists like Vertov were using. The idea that it is not such a great leap to extrapolate poetic forms and techniques from those who trade in moving images is suggested by a remark that Shklovsky made as early as 1925. Before Zukofsky's experiments with <i>"A"</i>, and well before Williams's innovative epic construction of <i>Paterson</i>, the former literary scholar suggested that writers could begin to think about expanding their palettes to include not just words but "documents and extracts from letters and newspapers."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 

<p>
Although his remark concerned the materials with which poets (and other writers) worked, Shklovsky understood that, if modern poetry were to acquire the vitality of newsreel, it would do so by following filmic methods of construction. These methods were always present, Shklovsky knew, and they always bore witness to the filmmaker's intelligence and artistry. What poets should finally concern themselves with was the process of assemblage, and not the act of imitating the ostensible <i>contents</i> of a film that purports to hold what Vertov called "life caught unawares," or a cinema that "show[s] people without masks," revealing them "in a moment when they are not acting" (<i>KE</i>, 41). So while Dziga Vertov claimed to have found an art form that rejected the artistry that detracted from the power of film, members of his artistic circles in Moscow, and watchful American filmmakers and poets in New York, questioned whether his construction of archival material was any more or less artful than Sergei Eisenstein's arresting assemblage of pieces of staged film (<i>RSCD</i>, 133).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Like many of the radical American filmmakers who were associated with the Workers' Film and Photo League (WFPL) between 1930 and 1935, Zukofsky and Williams were inspired and invigorated by nonfiction film coming out of the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  And although they were drawn to the idea that a poem could be made to ring hard like history, and that it could be waged less with allusions than with "[f]ists made of facts," both poets seemed to know that, while filmed news had become central to the development of a new Soviet aesthetic, its vibrancy did not hinge upon the material's innate fidelity to live events (<i>KE</i>, 39, 59).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 

<p>
Shklovsky's writings provide an especially rich theoretical ground for a study of the historical relationship between early Soviet cinema and American poetry. Not only did the literary scholar-turned-film critic anticipate the historical transposition of materials from one medium to the other&#x02014;from the documentary film to the long poem&#x02014;he also knew that it mattered how these materials were assembled. Shklovsky recognized that montage would be the method of an epoch, and he could see that this epoch was being shaped here and now by the fast-cut film sequences issuing from studios in and around Moscow, Leningrad, and the Ukraine. What Shklovsky may not have seen, and what I hope to explore further in this essay, is the extent to which the defining characteristics of Soviet film, such as the makeup and pace of their montage sequences, were determined by material circumstances, including an acute shortage of film stock during 

<b></b>

the transitional post-Revolutionary years. As a formalist, Shklovsky may not have been particularly attuned to the material genesis of Soviet montage, but he still possessed an uncanny understanding of the materials and methods that provided a common ground for Russian filmmakers and American poets. What set Shklovsky apart from other film writers&#x02014;critics in Russia, in Europe, and in America&#x02014;was his capacity to imagine forms of poetry made up of documents, letters, and newspapers. More importantly, his writings enable us to see how Soviet film of the 1920s contains within it some of the defining features of twentieth-century American poetry. In writing about the differences between fiction and nonfiction film, Shklovsky inadvertently illustrated how, in American poetry, a new storehouse of extraliterary materials came to be combined through new methods of montage construction.

<p class="noIndent">
Sergei Eisenstein is certainly the best known director to be associated with what some contemporary filmmakers derided as the "choppy cutting" technique of Soviet films.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  But it was in fact a widespread movement in Russian filmmaking that led many British and American critics of the late 1920s to designate "montage" as "Russian montage" and to claim that Soviet films formed "the arrowpoint of cinema progress."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This international cadre of viewers recognized that "choppy cutting" techniques were a source of real power: Soviet films were marked by briskness and by a heightened concentration of images. The Ukranian filmmaker Alexander Dovzhenko, for his part, spoke in 1934 of the extraordinary density of his own filmic constructions: "Out of a great quantity of material, which would suffice for the creation of five or six pictures, I make one single film, linked together by an unusually strong tension."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Kenneth Macpherson, the editor of the British film journal <i>Close Up</i> that circulated among British and American literary modernists, compared Soviet montage methods favorably to those practiced in Hollywood and indeed anywhere in the world.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  "The Russian director," Macpherson wrote, "makes a profound and exhaustive study of the art of cutting which has grown up in Russia alone, and which is unique in the world of cinema. The basic principle is never to repeat the same shot twice, and never to prolong any scene, whether a street with people, or a close up, or swift action, one moment longer than is necessary to convey the meaning to the spectator. This means that instead of about four to five hundred cuts in a film there may be anything from a thousand to four thousand."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 

<p>
By the late 1920s, not just Eisenstein's, but Russian films at large were known for their bracing movement and density of construction. And while Eisenstein was from the beginning the best known exponent of modern montage methods, his technique was derived from some less well known makers of newsreels and more elaborate unplayed montage constructions. One of Eisenstein's predecessors was Lev Kuleshov, an early filmmaker and theorist who wrote about montage and who undertook vital "experiments" in "rhythmic cutting" and "cross-cutting," techniques that were later "masterfully employed" by such "pupils" as Eisenstein himself.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The newsreel artist 

<b></b>

Vertov, who described his montage constructions as, variously, "hurricanes of movement" and "[h]urricanes of facts," also had a strong impact on Eisenstein.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  And while Eisenstein and Vertov disagreed about the extent to which cinema should depart from the conventions of theatrical production, the celebrated director of dramatized historical films clearly based aspects of his own cinematic style&#x02014;its nonfiction look and its use of rapid montage sequences&#x02014;upon the pioneering work that Vertov had done in his early <i>Kinonedelia</i> and <i>Kinopravda</i>  newsreel projects.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 

<p>
Vertov's newsreel montage methods hinged on brevity of shots and a reliance on old stock "compilation" footage: the rapid movement and on-site newsreel look were both distinguishing features of classic Soviet played films such as Eisenstein's <i>Potemkin</i> and <i>October</i>. (For <i>October</i>, his epic dramatization of the Bolshevik attack on the czar's Winter Palace, Eisenstein studied newsreel footage and photographs and reproduced them so assiduously that stills from the film's "newsreel reconstructions" appeared in newspapers [including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>] and in history books as photos of actual historical events [<i>K</i>, 231-2, 241]).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As early as 1916, Vertov was associating with young Soviet avant-garde artists including the writer and theoretician Osip Brik, the designer Alexander Rodchenko, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Vertov's filmic emphasis on both a dynamic form of construction and a fidelity to facts&#x02014;or to the daily news of utopian world building&#x02014;fit neatly not only within constructivist aesthetics, but also within the international aesthetic traffickings of these emerging Russo-Futurist artists.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  At the same time, however, the new aesthetic that Vertov so stridently broadcast was also a product of the severe material limitations that had been imposed upon Russian filmmakers during the years of civil war that followed the October Revolution. 

<p>
In 1918, Vladimir Lenin began calling for young Revolutionists to shoot and circulate newsreel footage that would help to facilitate ideological and social changes.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  By this time, studio owners and skilled workers in pre-Revolutionary cinema were beginning to flee the country; and in the process many of them were destroying the equipment, including cameras and supplies of film stock, that they could not carry with them when they left.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  During the years of internal struggle&#x02014;1918 to 1921 in particular&#x02014;that followed the actual Revolution, it was difficult if not impossible to replace these missing materials. As no film stock was being manufactured in the Soviet Union, Red Army cameramen had to rely on ingenious methods of acquiring sufficient quantities of film. Alexei Lemberg, one of the chief cameramen for Vertov's <i>Kinonedelia</i> (<i>Cine-Week</i>) and <i>Kinopravda</i> (<i>Cine-Truth</i>) series, remembers being sent to film a battle at Tsaritsyn, and having to barter his front-line rations for three boxes&#x02014;or three hundred sixty meters&#x02014;of negative film.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Having successfully traded for this film stock, Lemberg considered himself "rich." And he was indeed fortunate compared to another newsreel cameraman, Pyotr Yermolov, who was shooting a different propaganda film&#x02014;one that was half newsreel, half enacted film&#x02014;on a battlefront near Kiev. Unlike Lemberg, Yermolov was unable to barter for boxes of negative film; and so he had to devise a method of using <i>positive</i> film stock, "washing the emulsion from used film and recoating the celluloid by hand," in order to have something, however fragile it might finally prove to be, to feed into his camera (<i>K</i>, 150-1). 

<b></b>

<p>
Shortages of equipment during the civil war years affected directors and editors as well as the cameramen who worked with them. As Alexander Arossev described it in his 1935 retrospective on the growth of the Soviet cinema, 1920 was a year marked not only by an increased production of newsreels and propaganda or agitational films, but also by shortages that posed special challenges for directors: "There was no stock of raw film, and some pictures, e.g. 'Forest Brothers,' had to be taken literally on film strips of 5 and 10 metre lengths pieced together."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  And Vertov was in a position to be as affected as any filmmaker by the material shortages of that time. Lemberg and Yermolov were both leading newsreel cameramen who worked with Vertov on his weekly newsreel project, <i>Kinonedelia</i> (1918-1919). Their struggles to acquire film meant that, in piecing together his weekly filmic news magazine, Vertov himself was often left assembling fragile footage, or footage that was truncated, or footage that was missing altogether, forcing him to pillage existing film archives. In dealing with these shortages on a weekly basis, Vertov devised a filmic aesthetic that was based on two competing claims. On the one hand, he insisted that his films bore an inductive fidelity to actual experience, since his unplayed films didn't represent experience in any predetermined way, but rather worked it up through what Vertov called "previously shot, and therefore 'random' footage" (<i>KE,</i> 45). At the same time, he also spoke of his <i>Kinoglaz</i>, or "kino-eye," newsreel method as the active construction of a new reality through "montage," which Vertov described as a kind of "writing" or as the achievement of a "rhythmical order such that all links of meaning coincide with visual linkage" (<i>KE</i>, 88, 90). 

<p>
Written through Vertov's "hurricane of facts," this special montage language was, according to some film critics and historians, a direct outgrowth of the material shortages faced by filmmakers in the Soviet Union during the civil war years. As Thorold Dickinson and Catherine De la Roche noted in their thorough 1948 study of the development of Soviet cinema: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Scarcity of film stock and often the shortness of lengths of the negative film available taught [Vertov] and his contemporaries the most rigid economy in the use of film. And this led them to turn this liability into an asset. Forced to join a series of short scenes together, they began first to fill in the gaps with sections of existing (even czarist) newsreels [<i>sic</i>]. They found that the juxtaposition of certain scenes created conflict between the old material and the new. By this means they enriched their work with a new and dramatic style of cinema which had none of the literary or theatrical characteristics of the work of their contemporaries in fictional production.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p class="noIndent">
Dickinson and De la Roche suggest that this shortage-based economy and tension ultimately shaped not only Vertov's aesthetic, but Eisenstein's better known style of "choppy cutting" as well. "The necessity mentioned above," they wrote, "of having to use two short pieces of film, hence two different compositions, where one longer scene had been the custom before, was turned by Vertov into a virtue and by Eisenstein into a keystone of his whole theory of film construction" (<i>SC</i>, 24). Constructivist aesthetics notwithstanding, the "arrow point" of Soviet cinema progress was at least partly sharpened by accident.

2. Objectivism, Louis Zukofsky's "A", and Nonfiction Film
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Dziga Vertov was proud to be known as the filmmaker who had "infected" John Dos Passos with "kino-eye" (<i>KE</i>, 174). By 1934, the American novelist's debt to the Soviet filmmaker was an open secret. Dos Passos's recent novels, beginning with <i>The 42nd Parallel</i> , had been cut up into sections that were named after Vertov's own filmic devices. Headings like "Newsreel" and "The Camera Eye" signaled textual movements between public and private perspectives: first, those of "the common mind of the epoch," as broadcast in newspaper and newsreel headlines; and second, those of the more inward reflections that, by contemporary literary measures, seem sealed off from the noise of the crowd.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The connection between Dos Passos and Vertov is clear and direct. During a visit to Moscow and Leningrad in 1928, the then left-leaning writer attended screenings of unplayed "historical pictures"; and he preferred them to the grander, state-backed productions of Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. However much Dos Passos admired Vertov's use of "actual scenes and people," the link between the two artists is finally superficial because it is premised on the novelist's failure to hear the avant-garde filmmaker's call for the "cinema" to "undermine" "literature and the theater" and the traditional aesthetic distinctions that they uphold (<i>KE</i>, 14).<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Deeper than the link between <i>Kinoglaz</i> and the literary "Camera Eye" is the connection between Vertov's newsreel montage aesthetic and the work of American poets who sought new means of combining new sorts of nonfiction materials in their epic length poems. Williams and Zukofsky are chief among those poets who drew their theory and practice from the Soviet Union, and from Soviet avant-garde filmmakers in particular. And Objectivism is the poetic movement that bound these writers in their efforts to articulate their new, second-generation modernist aims. 

<p>
William Carlos Williams, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and, eventually, Lorine Niedecker, were among those American poets who dipped into the second-wave Objectivist lexicon; but it was really Zukofsky, in consultation with Ezra Pound, who launched this updated movement in 1930-1931. Objectivism can be best described as a Marxist poet's effort to substitute the authority of historical events for the clearly delineated "natural object" of that earlier movement in modern British and American poetry, Imagism.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In many ways, Objectivism was a response to the Imagist movement that Pound had fashioned in 1913. With its unreflective emphasis on clear seeing and clear writing ("Direct treatment of the 'thing'"), Imagism was a short-lived phase that had helped to orient a handful of influential American and British poets, including Pound, H. D., Richard Aldington, and, to a lesser extent, Williams himself (<i>LE</i>, 3). Insofar as the Objectivist emphasis on historical events over "thing[s]" reflects the modern documentarian's militantly anti-aesthetic preference for "reality itself rather than the re-enactment and artificial recreation of it," Vertov can be said to have helped American poets to sustain Imagism's referential na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;, carrying it over into Objectivism.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  He did this by bringing historical events to the forefront in the visual arts, an act that required faith in technology and in utopian politics. 

<p>
Compared to international arts movements like futurism or constructivism, Objectivism was a fairly insular response to events in American literary history. Nevertheless,

<b></b>

its credo is tinged by rhetorical traces of Vertov's faith in the camera and in Soviet socialist construction. These traces are evident in the opening lines of the founding essay that Zukofsky published in a special "Objectivists" issue that he edited for <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1931: "<i>An Objective: (Optics)&#x02014;The lens bringing the rays from an object to a focus. That which is aimed at. (Use extended to poetry)&#x02014;"</i> (<i>P+</i>, 12). "Lens"; "rays"; "a focus"; "aimed": all words and terms that revolve around the idea of seeing, or "optics." This notebook style opening is then followed by a list of the sorts of things, and events, that a contemporary poet might wish to see or experience. "<i>Desire for what is objectively perfect</i>," is how Zukofsky expressed it, "<i>inextricably the direction of historic and contemporary particulars</i>" (<i>P+</i>, 12). Included among these particulars are a delicate glass sculpture (lifted from a poem by Marianne Moore); a musical performance; and a reference to one of the most daunting works projects of the Soviet industrial age. "It is understood," Zukofsky wrote, "that historic and contemporary particulars may mean a thing or things as well as an event or chain of events: i.e. an Egyptian pulled-glass bottle in the shape of a fish or oak leaves, as well as the performance of Bach's <i>Matthew Passion</i> in Leipzig, and the rise of metallurgical plants in Siberia" (<i>P+</i>, 12). Eighteen years earlier, Imagists had been bent on purging poetry of abstract phrases: "Don't use such an expression as 'dim lands <i>of peace</i>,'" Pound wrote. "It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the <i>adequate</i> symbol" (<i>LE</i>, 5). Set against the majestic blast furnaces of Magnitogorsk&#x02014;constructions being filmed in 1931 by visitors like Margaret Bourke-White and Joris Ivens&#x02014;the error of mixing concrete with abstract forms of language seems somehow less egregious than it did when Pound drafted his Imagist <i>don'ts</i> list in 1913. With Objectivism, Zukofsky had taken the battle for clean poetic description and grafted it first <i>against</i>, and then <i>into</i>, the epochal "historical and contemporary particulars" of the twentieth century. Imagism was made to shrink toward its proper moment in literary history. 

<p>
By fashioning a movement that called for American writers to attend to "<i>what has happened</i> and what <i>is</i> happening," Zukofsky attempted to capture that sense of daily momentousness that drove Soviet art during the years following the October Revolution (<i>PZ</i>, 71).<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  And the appearance of factual materials&#x02014;documents, letters, and newspapers&#x02014;in poems like the <i>Cantos</i> and <i>"A"</i> and <i>Paterson</i> suggests that Soviet cinema may have contributed to the growing sense among American modernists that Pound had been right when he stated, in 1934, that "Literature is news that STAYS news."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The paired emphases on history and montage methods of construction mark a vital conjunction between Russian cinema and American poetry; and this conjunction has gone unnoticed for a number of reasons. For one thing, poetry was not a favored medium during the political decade of the 1930s. Because many leftist critics associated poetry with counter-revolutionary varieties of formalism, those who have sought to explore a correspondence between Soviet filmmakers and American writers have tended to focus on writers of innovative American narratives. Hence the attention to Dos Passos as a novelist who borrowed openly, if only nominally, from Vertov in fashioning the "Newsreel" and "The Camera Eye" portions of his trilogy of political novels 

<b></b>

of the 1930s. And the novelist John Steinbeck, too, drew indirectly from Soviet filmic traditions when he imitated the newsreel portions of Dos Passos's <i>U.S.A.</i>  in his own widely acclaimed portrait of dust bowl migration, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> . 

<p>
Louis Zukofsky was the first American poet to have really grappled with unplayed or nonacted forms of cinema coming out of the Soviet Union. Unlike Dos Passos, and unlike Langston Hughes later on in 1932, Zukofsky did not travel to Moscow in order to gain an exposure to Soviet film.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  He was instead a beneficiary of Amkino, a communist film distribution agency that brought Soviet films to American audiences in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In the fall of 1928, Zukofsky attended a showing of Soviet films in New York. One of these films was <i>A Shanghai Document</i>,a silent documentary about the "March Revolution," a violent and ultimately unsuccessful communist takeover in Shanghai. This film was shot in China by Varvara Stepanova, an avant- garde painter and collagist who belonged to the <i>LEF</i> circle; and it was directed by Jakov Bliokh, who worked earlier as the production manager for Eisenstein's <i>Potemkin</i>. <i>Shanghai Document</i> bore the avant-garde "nonacted" film stamp in its spare use of intertitles and in its refusal of dramatized episodes. Zukofsky was taken with its arresting montage of historical footage, including some visceral scenes depicting the execution of revolutionaries. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) Something about the film's construction seems to have spoken to Zukofsky, because it prompted him to write to William Carlos Williams about his recently undertaken epic poem, <i>"A"</i>: " . . . after this evening with Amkino, I can't help but know that I will <i>know</i> where I am at."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Later, in a 1936 essay on Charlie Chaplin's <i>Modern Times</i>, Zukofsky remembered Bliokh's film yet again: "[T]he mass scenes of <i>Modern Times</i>," he wrote, "mov[e] with the newsreel immediacy and swift timing of Jacob Blokh's <i>A Shanghai Document</i>" (<i>P+</i>, 62).

<p>
The slap-in-the-face feeling, together with the rushed sensation, that Zukofsky took from Bliokh's film are nothing less than the hallmarks of Vertov's newsreel montage aesthetic. <i>A Shanghai Document</i> provided a direction for the modern collage poet because it possessed the shocking immediacy of real events. In this case, the events in question included a row of bound, kneeling prisoners being shot, one by one, through the backs of their heads, by charging executioners who seem barely able to control their actions. In addition to providing a sudden and unprecedented brush with an ultimate taboo, Bliokh's film spoke to Zukofsky as a document that was constructed not through a traditional sequential narrative, but rather through an aesthetic of contrast and collision. Zukofsky saw right away that this aesthetic could jumpstart his own poetry; and he was not alone in acknowledging the broad aesthetic significance of the nonacted newsreels being produced in Russia and Eastern Europe in the late 1920s. 

<p>
In an essay written in 1928, in <i>The Exile</i>, Zukofsky's mentor, Ezra Pound, uttered rare praise for a fast-paced composite newsreel depicting modern urban life. <i>Berlin: The Symphony of a Great City</i> was a fifty-minute film released in 1927 by the German filmmakers Walter Ruttmann and Karl Freund. Ruttmann and Freund's film was always closely associated with Vertov's work; and indeed Vertov had had a strong audience for his newsreel films in Berlin in the mid-1920s, before Ruttmann and Freund's film was made.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Despite the distaste that he professed elsewhere for the cinema, 

<b></b>

Pound spoke of <i>Symphony</i> as "a film that will take serious aesthetic criticism: one that is in the movement, and that should flatten out the opposition . . . [to avant-garde writing] . . . with steamrolling ease and commodity."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Zukofsky took note of this rare concession to the power of the motion picture, citing it in an essay that he wrote about Pound's <i>Cantos</i> in 1929.

Whatever Pound's assessment of Ruttmann and Freund's cinematic rendering of modern Berlin, it was an aesthetic of unplayed immediacy on the one hand, and of bracing montage construction on the other, that offered a model for Zukofsky when he saw Bliokh's unblinking documentary in 1928. And while these aesthetics were promulgated in the context of Russian avant-garde art of the 1920s, they developed first and foremost as a response to the shortages of the Soviet Union's civil-war years. Through Vertov and other newsreel artists, the filmic tendencies that emerged from these shortages eventually found their way into American poetic theory and practice. The Objectivist movement that Zukofsky spearheaded in 1931, for example, added not only the dynamic notion of the <i>event</i> to the noun-bound stasis of Imagism, it also added a visual twist to the Imagist premises upon which it was based. For his new movement, the young poet had concocted an aesthetic statement that was superficially cinematic; and it was enough so that the essay that he composed for <i>An "Objectivists" Anthology</i>  won notice in a September 1933 issue of <i>Close Up</i>. There, the film critic Oswell Blakeston summarized "Mr. Zukofsky's manifesto on poetry":

<b></b>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"An objective&#x02014;rays of the object brought to a focus," 

<p class="blockquote">
"An objective&#x02014;nature as creator&#x02014;desire for what is objectively perfect."
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As Blakeston presented it, Objectivism was more or less identical to Imagism. Both movements wanted to truly delineate the object or "thing." For a film critic, however, the Objectivist manifesto places a distinguishing emphasis on the object's "rays" and the poet's capacity to bring them "to a focus." It was above all the rhetoric of mechanical seeing that landed Zukofsky's poetic within "the province of the cineaste."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 

<p>
Objectivism may or may not have deserved its brief moment in the world of film criticism. But Zukofsky's poetry was in any event animated by the example of Soviet cinema. In writing <i>"A"</i>, Zukofsky openly kept the <i>Cantos</i> in mind as a model. And he believed that the structural complexity of his and Pound's work was due in part to their debt to new methods of filmic construction. "We both partake of the cinematic principle," Zukofsky wrote to Pound in 1931, "you to a greater and more progressive degree, tho' it wd. be pretty hard to distinguish in either case where montage leaves off &amp; narration begins &amp; vice versa" (<i>PZ</i>, 112). Here, Zukofsky seems to invoke Eisenstein more than Vertov when he refers to montage as a technique that transcends the smaller matter of the fictional or nonfictional status of the filmic material. Of the two filmmakers, Vertov was certainly more concerned with his source materials; but he was not indifferent to the question of how these materials should be joined. At times, he tried explicitly to steer his own medium toward poetry by highlighting a constructivist understanding of how "the composition of a film" might be "based" "on the lines of a repeating pattern somewhat after the manner of certain verse forms." This effort to use repetition to bridge film and poetry had won him notice in Russia as "the head of [a new] school of cinematic composition."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  In the matter of assemblage, however, it was Eisenstein who claimed the more sophisticated understanding of montage as a medium for combining static "shots" into dialectical "collisions" that would awaken viewers both aesthetically and politically (<i>FF</i>, 5, 26-7, 34-5; <i>PCCR</i>, 33). Embarking in 1929 on a long trip to Hollywood to study the new technique of "sound film," the young director had begun to emerge as a charismatic intellectual with an international following.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Zukofsky's respect for Eisenstein's inventiveness and his energy is borne out by the poet's further suggestion to Pound that, in terms of "montage, Mr. E.,&#x02014;Eisenstein has nothing on us" (<i>PZ</i>, 121).

<p>
While he openly identified his writing style with Eisenstein's montage method, the erudite Marxist writer seems to have been moved first and foremost by the lesser known documentary filmmakers whose work he encountered in New York City in 1928. For all of their originality and daunting ambition, the first books of <i>"A"</i> bear the mark of a writer who is beginning to "<i>know</i> where [he is] at." In the opening lines of a poem that would take nearly fifty years to write, and one that would eventually reach over 800 pages in length, Zukofsky squared away his deep love for Bach, invoking a Carnegie Hall performance of the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> for thematic grounding and for the piece's intimation of a framing design. From this canny beginning, <i>"A"</i> turns on both narrative sequences, and on more haphazardly word-driven, metonymic forms of 

<b></b>

association. Zukofsky himself used the word "montage" to invoke the more associative side of his poetic procedure; and he links his musical form to film because, like Vertov's work of the 1920s, the latter medium accommodates news, and particularly news of class struggle. The following words are among those heard and recorded outside of the particular performance, and the particular performance hall, that mark the time and place of <i>"A"</i>'s beginning:

Unlike Vertov's, Zukofsky's news reaches us through a series of dark filters. The voice that reports the events is here itself an object that merits scrutiny. While Zukofsky follows Lenin in singling out the cinema as a leading instrument of social change, he doesn't always view it as a tool that serves the greater good. Indeed, the poet almost repeats verbatim Lenin's naively sincere assessment regarding the importance of cinema to the objectives of socialist construction. To his Commissar of Education, Anatoli Lunacharsky, Lenin is said to have expressed his belief that "<i>of all the arts for us the most important is cinema</i>."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Here, in a passage that mocks Lenin's idealism regarding the possibility of Soviet world building through an emerging new filmic medium, Zukofsky asks whether the newsreel might not be used as much to <i>suppress</i> worker rebellion as to foster it.

For Zukofsky, the cinema seems to be poised between the deeply corporeal (bullets; the Minnesota Massacre) and the uncannily ephemeral (gas; "Diaphanous"). Whatever this poet's understanding of the innate power of the moving picture, the violent yet vaporous "news reel" left its stamp on <i>"A"</i>. The modern American epic poem has the capacity to do more than just <i>hold</i> both gas and bullets, or both the Bach performance and the Pennsylvania miners' strike: it has the means to weld them together into a larger guiding whole. While Zukofsky's poem portrays the cinema as a medium that is less than utopian, <i>"A"</i> does suggest, in its eclectic and inclusive structure, that a future language can be constructed from the very sorts of archival fragments that filmmakers were forced to use during times of crisis and shortage. Simply put, the pieces of newsreel that make up portions of Zukofsky's poem would not have been there without the Soviet tradition of unplayed film. And without the material shortages that coincided with the call to produce and distribute newsreels about the making of the new state, this tradition would not have developed in the openly modern and contingent manner that it did.

3. Vertov, Eisenstein, and William Carlos Williams's Paterson
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>


<p class="noIndent">
It is difficult to say for sure that Vertov's documentary camera was central to the newfound Objectivist aesthetics that united a handful of ambitious and left-leaning American poets in the early 1930s (<i>FS</i>, 22). But Objectivism did emerge just as the first English-language reviews of Vertov's films began to surface in journals like <i>Hound and Horn</i>, <i>Close Up</i>, and <i>The Realist</i> in 1929. <i>Experimental Cinema</i>, published between 1930 and 1934, provided a radical American audience, including filmmakers and writers, with critical discussions of Vertov's films, and it also provided writings by Mikhail Kauffman, Vertov's brother and cameraman. William Carlos Williams was among those American poets who developed an interest in documentary writing, photography, and filmmaking. Apart from publishing his poetry, and writings about poetry and politics, in the aforementioned literary journals, he subscribed to <i>Experimental Cinema</i>, together with other journals that took up the question of visual arts and the significance of documentary methods to current work in American film, radio, and poetry as well. <i>Hound and Horn</i>, <i>The Left</i>, <i>U.S.A.</i>, and <i>Direction</i> were among the magazines that placed the poet in dialogue with writings by and about Russian, British, and American nonfiction filmmakers (<i>WCWAB</i>, 115-7). 

<p>
While there is arguably a documentary cast to much of Williams's writing of the 1930s, his long poem <i>Paterson</i>, conceived during the 1930s and written and published largely during the next decade, represents a major work of twentieth-century American

<b></b>

poetry that has been touched if not tailored by Soviet filmic aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> <i>Paterson</i> tells the story of a town in New Jersey by cutting back and forth between passages of poetry and prose passages made up of fragmented historical documents. Some of <i>Paterson</i>'s prose fragments come from history books, while others are more anecdotal, unselfconscious notes on the order of letters to the poet, or to others, from neighbors and acquaintances. In many ways, the "newsreel" portions of <i>Paterson</i> are more "personal," or "daily," than the corresponding portions of the <i>Cantos</i> or of Zukofsky's <i>"A"</i>. For Williams, this emphasis on personal interior experience was not at all antithetical to an emphasis on facts. And the effort to reconcile the two was in some ways an outgrowth of <i>Paterson</i>'s historical moment. 

<p>
The first portions of <i>Paterson</i> were written in the 1940s, amid the horrors of fascism in Europe, and amid the disillusionment that followed evidence of Stalin's "Great Purge" of 1936-1939. By the late 1930s, most Americans knew that ill-conceived collectivization programs had led to the deaths of millions of Soviet farmers: many had died of famine, many of imprisonment or execution. Taken alongside the disappearance and deaths of artists including Sergei Tretyakov, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Isaac Babel, and Osip Mandelstam, Mayakovsky's suicide in 1930 now seemed a grim foreshadowing of the penalties to be exacted against those artists and intellectuals who would refuse to work according to strict state guidelines. At a moment when totalitarian governments seemed to be on the rise, and, by 1939, even in collusion in Europe, <i>Paterson</i> followed other ambitious American arts projects in seeking a less political and more manageably personal sort of scale.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In <i>Paterson</i>, there is an unavoidable inward turn that is marked by the appearance of a series of uncomfortable, accusing letters written to Williams&#x02014;addressed here as "Dr. P."&#x02014;by a poet named Marcia Nardi (she wants Williams to praise her poetry). And while the inclusion of this personal correspondence certainly helps us to locate the poem within its historical moment, <i>Paterson</i> still doesn't achieve the inwardness of confessional poetry, or of Jackson Pollack's idiosyncratic drip paintings. The formal markings that make <i>Paterson</i> so distinctive, even as it partakes of a tradition that includes the <i>Cantos</i> and <i>"A"</i>, can be attributed to a number of sources; and the practice and theory of early Soviet filmmakers and critics certainly seems to be prominent among them. Williams's singular mid-century long poem in fact displays a formula for a new kind of writing that had been suggested by Viktor Shklovsky when the Russian formalist had written in 1925 that the eclectic material that went into the newsreel, or into the "everyday" nonfiction film, might also be of use to writers who sought to renew perception by expanding the base of the materials from which they drew. "The primary raw material of cinema," Shklovsky suggested to his <i>LEF</i> compatriots, "is not the film object but a certain method of filming it. Only a certain approach by the cameraman will make the frame tangible. But this kind of work is quite possible for a writer if he operates not with words but with more complex fragments of literary material. By using an epigraph, a writer contrasts the whole of his work with another work. By using documents and extracts from letters and newspapers, the writer does not cease to be an artist but merely alters the sphere of application of the principles of art" (<i>RSCD,</i> 133).

<b></b>

<p>
In this passage, Shklovsky is not really speaking about film or literature per se. He is talking about the artistry of construction as it applies, not to one special art form, but across the spectrum to a whole host of related forms. As he highlights questions about the significance of the <i>materials</i> in use, moreover, Shklovsky reveals that he is speaking first and foremost to Dziga Vertov, and to the <i>Kinoki</i> or <i>Cine-Eye</i> movement that the newsreel innovator began to launch in 1922. Shklovsky's message to Vertov is that, in fostering a new brand of unplayed cinema, the revolutionary filmmaker cannot simply "break with art" by rejecting the actor and other stale theater conventions. What Shklovsky wants Vertov to see is that the difference between fiction and nonfiction is conventional rather than innate. The filmmaker's artistry is unavoidable; it lies in methods of selection and assemblage. Vertov might cling to his belief that the actual material of nonfiction film contains an innate energy that montage can heighten.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  After all, the advocate of "life caught unawares" had described the <i>Cine-Eye</i> newsreel in 1923 as "<i>a rapid survey of VISUAL events interpreted by the film camera, fragments of REAL energy (as distinct from the theatrical), building by intervals to an accumulated whole through the great skill of montage</i>" (<i>RSCD</i>, 94). Vertov does acknowledge here that his newsreel practice hinges on the artful execution of montage. But he also maintains that every cinematic unit of "life caught unawares" contains "<i>fragments of REAL energy</i>." For this reason, unplayed cinema is more innately dynamic than any measure of played cinema, no matter how expertly the latter is executed or assembled. Placing his emphasis on the defamiliarizing strategies that artists bring to the available materials, Shklovsky would have little patience for such a static conception of art. For him, cinema hinges entirely on modes of assemblage: "The contrast between one moment and another&#x02014;montage&#x02014;is realised in accordance with the unifying principle of art" (<i>RSCD</i>, 133).

<p>
In his 1925 essay, "The Semantics of Cinema," Shklovsky illuminates the rift between the two forms, played and unplayed cinema, that divide the best film work coming out of the Soviet Union in the 1920s. In the process, he issues an off-handed remark about possible new forms of writing. While this comment is incidental, serving to illustrate a larger discussion about art, it tells us something about Soviet literature in the 1920s; and it provides an astonishingly prescient outline of the future shape of avant-garde American poetry.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Though the author of "Art as Device" lacked access to the Malatesta Cantos of 1922-1923, he would have found his own call to utilize "documents and extracts from letters" echoed in Ezra Pound's textual reproduction of the half-legible personal letters that had spilled out before him while he researched his epic poem in an archive in Italy. Following Pound's recondite but pioneering work, and building upon the earlier example of collage artists like Picasso and Braque, American poets seemed increasingly willing to imagine poems made from extra-literary materials. (By the 1930s, a growing number of writers&#x02014;Muriel Rukeyser in "The Book of the Dead" [1938], Langston Hughes in "Broadcast on Ethiopia" [1936]&#x02014;sought to structure their inventive work around the incorporation of material that had not yet found its way onto the poetic page.) Given the archival inclusiveness of his eclectic poem <i>"A"</i>, Zukofsky provides a particularly timely response to Shklovsky's appeal; and 

<b></b>

Williams, with his special interest in contemporary documentary forms, seems almost to have realized the Russian formalist's idea, fifteen years later, with <i>Paterson</i>.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup> 

<p>
Whatever it reveals about Soviet mixed-genre writing of the 1920s, or about American collage poetry of the twentieth century, Shklovsky's suggestion that writers could still be artful if they chose to operate "not with words" but with "documents and extracts from letters and newspapers" is striking in terms of the kinds of materials it elicits. Documents, letters, and newspapers amount to a sort of literary translation of the material of nonfiction film. And in the context of this essay on early Soviet cinema and American poetry, they provide us with a fairly accurate list of what's there inside <i>Paterson</i>. More than offering an illuminating list of materials, however, Shklovsky's statement testifies to the importance of methods of assemblage in cinema and in literature both. Emerging as it does out of a dialogue with Soviet filmmakers like Eisenstein and Vertov, it returns us to the film stock shortages that engendered the bold experiments in montage, experiments that initially involved newsreel footage, and the joining together of short pieces of film that came not only from different archives, but in the case of pre-Revolutionary film clips, from different historical and ideological epochs as well. Here, the coincidence of Lenin's call for newsreel production, combined with a shortage of film stock for the making of newsreels, reverberates into the American century, and into the development of new varieties of epic poetry.

<p>
As a history of the Passaic Falls, <i>Paterson</i> is often, but not always, filled with a newsreel variety of "news." Because its episodes pitch so quickly from the essential to the eccentric&#x02014;from banking and manufacturing to tightrope-walking and the pursuit of loose animals&#x02014;and because these episodes are so often joined through whimsy or puns, the poem generates a kind of unpredictability that can be both liberating and disturbing to readers. What'sliberating about <i>Paterson</i>&#x02014;and what finally distinguishes it from both the <i>Cantos</i> and <i>"A"</i>&#x02014;is the degree to which new stories and new genres are made to co-exist through the most permissive of linking strategies. Puns and other detours connect one scene to another, as do the proliferating set of metalinguistic operations that fall under the heading of "metonymy." In <i>Paterson</i>, the story of the falls-jumper pertains to that of the bank-founder through a pun, or a mere coincidence of word sounds. The aural proximity of words that bear no conceptual kinship reminds us that, one day, we too will come to hear "the roar of the river/ forever in our ears (arrears)" (<i>P</i>, 17). Sam Patch (the jumper) and Alexander Hamilton have no more reason to pass through the same town or poem than a phrase that invokes "speechlessness" (the "roar" in "our ears") has a reason to invoke "debt" ("arrears"). (In Williams's poem, speechlessness <i>is</i> in fact related to debt; both involve a blocking of mediums&#x02014;language, currency&#x02014;that should facilitate, rather than inhibit, exchanges between members of a community.) What's special about <i>Paterson</i> is that the poem, like the place, is a venue that admits and includes this particular blend of people, stories, and concepts without providing even the slimmest pretense of a reason for doing so. They belong together simply because they arrived here together, and the poet's work is the lazy re-creation of their coincidence. 

<b></b>


<p>
While <i>Paterson</i>'s inclusiveness might seem wonderfully democratic, it also challenges us by asking whether it allows for the sorts of boundaries that make a poem artful, or a city livable. The second "book" of Williams's five-part epic was written in 1948. Entitled "Sunday in the Park," it displays the public face of the postwar American immigrant city. The Sunday that Williams describes is in fact a mixture of pleasures and simmering crises; and most of these crises have to do with the very question of joining that haunts the poem as an epic that gathers up and strings together the episodes that drift through its frame. <i>Paterson</i>'s crisis on this "Sunday" stems from its inability to control coupling: "&#x02014;soon no one in the park but/ guilty lovers and stray dogs" (<i>P</i>, 80). The problem with the lovers and the dogs on this Sunday is the same as everyday; and it is a problem that Williams animates by reprinting a letter written by a local girl, a stranger to him, named Florence Plarey (<i>P</i>, 270):

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Dear B. Please excuse me for not having told you this when I was over to your house. I had no courage to answer your questions so I'll write it. Your dog <i>is</i> going to have puppies although I prayed she would be okey [sic]. It wasn't that she was left alone as she never was but I used to let her out at dinner time while I hung up my clothes. . . . He must have come between your hedge and the house. <i>Every few</i> seconds I would run to the end of the line or peek under the sheets to see if Musty was alright. She was until I looked a minute too late. I took sticks and stones after the dog but he wouldn't beat it.

Florence Plarey's story could hardly provide a sharper contrast than it does to the testimony of the young cement worker who speaks in Vertov's <i>Three Songs about Lenin</i>. The city that Williams chronicles in <i>Paterson</i> is not a place where medals are awarded for the "overfulfillment" of Five Year Plans. Williams's is rather a bourgeois world of dinner and loose dogs; it is a world that the poet tries to apprehend in terms of the successes and failures of emergent twentieth-century art forms like the cinema. Does the documentary camera have the power, as one of the founders of the Workers' Film and Photo League put it, to "expose and combat the Hollywood lies that fill the American screens," or, as Williams himself wrote, "to blast away our stinking flesh of [propagandistic] news" ("CW," 29; <i>WCWAB</i>, 120)? <i>Paterson</i> uses a missing piece of film, an excerpt from a movie that Sergei Eisenstein tried to make in Mexico, to suggest that, while poetry may well "extend the document," the camera cannot finally serve "as a weapon in the class struggle" (<i>US1</i>, 146; "CW," 28).

In <i>Paterson</i>, Musty's misadventures are followed by a verse-form description of an immigrant family on a picnic. This vernacular-dotted poem ("Blah! <i>Excrementi!</i>" [<i>P</i>, 57]) carries another inside it: a poem that turns on an image from a "lost" film by Eisenstein. (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) Mike Weaver suggests that Williams had known of the controversy surrounding <i>Que Viva Mexico!</i> not only through the pages of <i>Experimental Cinema</i>, but also through a viewing of a later attempt to salvage what remained of its footage, a version edited by Marie Seton, and shown in New York, in 1941, under the title <i>Time in the Sun</i> (<i>WCWAB</i>, 207). Here, Williams splices into <i>Paterson</i> not a letter from a neighbor, but an image from a film that was notorious for having been withheld from the director who had expected to cut the negative that he had shot (<i>SE</i>, 190). Placed where it is alongside the Musty episode and amid the sexualized description of the immigrant woman's dance, the verse-form clip from <i>Que Viva Mexico!</i>, or, more accurately, <i>Time</i> 

<b></b>

<i>in the Sun</i>, serves to mock America's insatiable taste for sexual suppression. More than that, it challenges the very methods of assemblage that undergird both Williams's and Eisenstein's varieties of modernism.

Whether "montage" is governed by an aesthetic of "linkage" or one of dialectical "collision," its blending of visual and conceptual joining strategies facilitates a seemingly limitless variety of syntactic possibilities (<i>FF</i>, 37-8, 45-63). Montage was an unprecedented technique that was vital enough to break the frame of realism, to restore the truth of disproportion, to "make the stones roar," as Eisenstein himself put it.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) Resting as they do at the interstices of visual and conceptual syntax, the expressive possibilities of montage seem to extend in all directions, to encompass all kinds of joinings.

that of <i>Paterson</i>'s Anglo-Saxon reader, or that of the grimly prudish socialist Upton Sinclair, the images that unfold from Williams's and Eisenstein's reckless montage sequences must be contained, be they flashes of Mary's vulgarity, or of the peon's extravagance: drinking, slopping, laughing.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  "All [Eisenstein's] associates were Trotskyites, and all homos," wrote a vindictive Sinclair in 1950, still seeking to explain why he withheld Eisenstein's film. "Men of that sort stick together, and we were besieged by them for several years" (<i>SE</i>, 187-8, 515). 

<p>
There are a number of ways of reading the lost image that is pasted into the Sunday park in <i>Paterson</i>. On the one hand, the peasant who drinks with "abandon" intrudes as an almost grotesque reminder of the unmanageably expressive range of modernity&#x02014;a range that Stalin himself sought to tame by restricting not just the avant-garde, but all "formalistic" approaches that made art seem challenging and complex and hence dangerously esoteric. By 1932, Eisenstein's world-renowned "montage" practice was under increasing attack in Moscow as a "mere formalistic device"; formalists like Shklovsky were by then already eclipsed from the scene, forbidden from publishing their own writings since 1929 (<i>SE</i>, 248; <i>SEB</i>, 150, 168, 92-3, 181).<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  On the other hand, we can also take the lost peasant with his spilled wine as an emblem for the inclusiveness that enables Williams to recover him amid the sterile goings-on of Paterson, New Jersey. The image fits because montage allows it to fit there; the man's "heavenly" gesture belongs to another medium and to another epoch; and yet it repeats and deepens the sweeping image of the Old World immigrant woman&#x02014;a "suppressed but persistent" American who drinks and dances in celebration of yet another day of togetherness and rest. 

<p>
In <i>Paterson</i>, a woman named Mary stands up and "lifts one arm holding the cymbals/ of her thoughts. . . . " Bound up in this gesture is a pun (crashing cymbals instead of symbols); an allusion to the Statue of Liberty (stripped of its status as a symbol); and a pose that is archaic and, by <i>Paterson</i>'s lights, even archetypal. "This is the old, the very old, old upon old," Williams writes: it is "the hand holding the cup, the wine/ spilling, the arm stained by it." The peon "in the lost/ Eisenstein film" is in dialogue with all of this as he tilts his wine-skin, drinking "so that it slopped down his chin[,]/ down his neck, dribbling/ over his shirt-front and down/ onto his pants. . . . " Mary raises one arm, an undying cup is raised, and the wine falls down, down, down over the Mexican peasant. The spilling wine is the metonymic medium that links the peon to the scene. What he brings to this Sunday in the park is not so much the "suppressed but persistent" tale of America's changing ethnographic and sexual politics, but a story that is even more deeply hidden from Williams's contemporary American readers. In the image of a spreading wine stain, this clip from a lost film restores to our past the film stock shortages of the civil war years that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. It brings us closer to a source of the modern imperative of documentation, and the belief in the power of the camera that, however transient, left its mark on the twentieth-century American long poem.

It is probably not an accident that the first worker to tell her story in a Vertov film should have been constructing a hydroelectric dam, and particularly one that had become an international emblem of Soviet industrialization. Vertov had long been interested in the idea of electrification, and he had been asking for state support for a film on that subject since 1922. See Margarita Tupitsyn, <i>The Soviet Photograph, 1924-1937</i> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996), 14. Through the use of the newsreel camera, moreover, electricity can literally extend the reach of the worker correspondent, bringing testimonials, together with the appearance of widespread worker participation, to remote areas with high rates of illiteracy. Vertov's confidence in the power of nonfiction cinema is bound to his Leninist confidence in the epistemological consequences of electrification: light will metaphorically enlighten the Soviet populace.

See Dziga Vertov, <i>Three Songs about Lenin</i> (Moscow, 1934). Vertov had his own moment of glory as a recipient of the Order of the Red Star, in 1935, "for his 'outstanding contribution' to Soviet culture" (<i>BD,</i> 288). The award was actually a source of confusion for the filmmaker because <i>Three Songs</i> was critically acclaimed outside of the Soviet Union and yet scarcely noticed within. Vertov believed that Lenin was beloved by all and that the Soviet public wanted to see his filmic tribute to the father of the Bolshevik Revolution. He never understood why a Stalinist bureaucrat would confiscate such a glowing tribute to Lenin on the night of its debut.

Of poetry, Ford remarks: "I read poetry, and I enjoy it/ If it says anything,/ But so often it doesn't say anything" (<i>"A"</i>, 26). Karl Marx's writings, passages from <i>Das Kapital</i> and passages from his personal letters as well, are woven throughout "<i>A8</i>" (<i>"A"</i>, 46, 43-105). Zukofsky does not always quote Marx verbatim; in places, the poet alters Marx's words, often by distilling lengthy passages. In Zukofsky's hands, Marx often sounds more humanistic.

avant-garde tradition comes from his recollection of his first viewing, at the Eighth Street Playhouse in New York, in 1930, of Vertov's <i>The Man with a Movie Camera</i> (<i>K</i>, 251-2). Leyda's comments about <i>Potemkin</i> and about the broadly "explosive" impact of Soviet filmmakers of the 1920s can be found in his essay, "A Correction" , in <i>K</i>, 16. Films were sometimes called "living photographs" when they circulated, as novelties, in Europe and Russia at the end of the nineteenth century (<i>K</i>, 23).

Tretyakov does not simplify the complex stances of either Eisenstein or Vertov in his analysis. To begin with, he does not deny that Vertov assigns a special ontological status to the "'raw' material" that he captures with his newsreel camera ("the material itself is most important," ["SOSD," 29-31]). Eisenstein was certainly less polemical about "facts" than was Vertov, but, as a Revolutionist who placed stock in the momentousness of daily events, he began his career believing that art could and should be somehow anchored to "reality." See Marie Seton, <i>Sergei M. Eisenstein</i> (New York: A. A. Wyn, Inc., n.d.), 66; hereafter abbreviated <i>SE</i>. The master of "played" cinema came to filmmaking from the Soviet theater, where he had worked not only with Tretyakov, but also with the inventive constructivist Vsevolod Meyerhold. In his work with both of these innovators, and in his earliest efforts with the camera, Eisenstein had indeed tried to weave facts into his theatrical and then filmic productions. He staged Tretyakov's play, <i>Gas Masks</i>, in the Moscow Gas Factory; and, working on a play based on a Jack London story, <i>The Mexican</i>, with Meyerhold, he proposed that actors perform a real boxing match before the audience. For his first film, <i>Strike</i> , moreover, Eisenstein conceived of a riveting montage sequence, splicing the butchering of a live bull over the staged rifle massacre of striking factory workers&#x02014;a controversial sequence to be filmed by the accomplished newsreel cameraman, Eduard Tisse (<i>SE</i>, 66-9).

Katerina Clark writes that many members of the avant-garde used "science as a legitimating authority" in order to perpetuate a confusion between aesthetic and political vanguards in the Soviet Union. See Katerina Clark, <i>Petersburg, Crucible of Cultural Revolution</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995), 43; hereafter abbreviated <i>PCCR</i>. In Clark's view, it was this need for political legitimacy that led avant-garde artists of the early 1920s to seek out the views of Viktor Shklovsky, a young formalist whose work represented a "scientific" approach to literature and language study (<i>PCCR</i>, 43).

Tyrus Miller argues that Shklovsky sought to alter discussions of Soviet cinema in a manner that bypassed the plainly inadequate distinction between fiction and nonfiction film. See Tyrus Miller, "Documentary/Modernism: Convergence and Complementarity in the 1930s,"  9.2 (April 2002): 227-8; hereafter abbreviated "DM." In Miller's view, the distinction between fiction and nonfiction is bound to yet another view of Soviet film as a medium that hovers between "realist and modernistic treatment[s] of the film narrative" ("DM," 228). Shklovsky succeeded in altering the terms of the discussion by shifting Soviet film away from these old distinctions and relocating its dividing line between the presentation of familiar and raw material. While the material of film was not important in the way that Vertov claimed it to be, Shklovsky knew that the presence of ostensibly "raw" material&#x02014;in Vertov's case, current events placed on the screen&#x02014;would refresh the use of defining filmic devices such as montage. Films like Vertov's bridged "'modernistic' and 'naturalistic' impulses" because they used the material of current events in service of defining modernist devices such as montage ("DM," 228). See also Shklovsky, in "SOSD," 33.

In his 1925 essay, "The Semantics of Cinema," Shklovsky questioned Vertov's militant newsreel aesthetic and placed a premium on the emerging device of montage: "The Cine-Eyes [Vertov's newsreel film group] reject the actor and think that in so doing they are breaking with art, but the actual selection of moments to be filmed is itself a deliberate act" (<i>RSCD</i>, 133).

Soviet newsreels, and the newsreel aesthetic devised and articulated by Vertov, influenced Zukofsky and Williams both directly and indirectly. Zukofsky saw and responded to documentary films that were made in the Soviet Union and shown in New York. See Weaver, <i>WCWAB</i>, 121; see also below. Williams modeled some of his own documentary practices and aesthetics after those set forth by groups like the Workers' Film and Photo League (WFPL). On Williams's interest in the WFPL and in other radical movements among American photographers and filmmakers, see <i>WCWAB,</i> 55-8, 115-21. One of the founders of the American branch of the WFPL, Samuel Brody, discusses Vertov's importance to his vision of this militant organization. See Tony Stafford, "The Camera as a Weapon in the Class Struggle: Interview with Samuel Brody," <i>Jump Cut</i> 14 (30 March 1977), 28; hereafter abbreviated "CW." For a discussion of the WFPL as an international organization, one that took its beginnings in a Leninist propaganda initiative of 1921, see Heather Puttock, "From Class Warfare to the Building of a New Social Order: The (Workers') Film and Photo League as Microcosm of the 1930s," master's thesis, University of London, September 1997.

That Zukofsky wanted to write his poetry into history is suggested by some of the names that he proposed for his poetry movement, Objectivism. "Poets, 1931 . . . or U.S.A., 1931 . . . or what do you suggest?" he asked Pound in 1930. "Or Objectivists, 1931, or The Third Decade . . ." (<i>PZ</i>, 69). Zukofsky was much more restrained than Williams in his embrace of the militant camera. Though he claimed to have been inspired as a poet by an unflinching documentary portrayal of a failed communist uprising in China, he chose Eisenstein and his calculated montage method as a model for his own poetic procedures. Williams, by contrast, squeezed the bullets from Vertov's militant suggestion that his newsreel method amounted to a Revolutionary "cameras' attack" on "bourgeois cinema" and through it the very "bourgeois structure of the world" (<i>KE</i>, 39). Williams wrote a "blind" introduction to a book of poems in 1939, calling in it for a violent poetic purge of the sort of "false news" that was then associated with Hollywood in radical filmmaking circles: "The epic poem would be our 'newspaper,' Pound's cantos are the algebraic equivalent but too perversely individual to achieve the universal understanding required. The epic if you please is what we're after, but not the lyric-epic sing-song. It must be a concise sharpshooting epic style. Machine gun style. Facts, facts, facts, tearing into us to blast away our stinking flesh of news. Bullets." This introduction can be found under the heading, "Introduction to Book of David Ruth," among the poet's papers at SUNY Buffalo (<i>WCWAB</i>, 120). That Williams should have rhetorically embraced the militarism maintained by Samuel Brody does not mean that he went so far as to share with Brody a Vertovian belief that "the film medium was at its most effective and powerful level when its raw material was reality itself rather than the re-enactment and artificial recreation of it" ("CW," 28). Far from sharing Vertov's utopian militarism, the author of <i>Paterson</i> was less sanguine about the possibility of meaningful political reform after 1939 than even the young liberal poet, Muriel Rukeyser, who made the following modest claim at the end of her long poem, "The Book of the Dead" : "Poetry can extend the document." See Muriel Rukeyser, <i>U.S.1</i> (New York: Covici Friede, 1938), 146; hereafter abbreviated <i>US1</i>.

See Seymour Stern, "Hollywood Bulletin," <i>Experimental Cinema</i> 1.2 (June 1930): 13. Stern reports that this term was used derisively by Hollywood filmmakers who saw two of Eisenstein's films, <i>Potemkin</i> and <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> [also known as <i>October</i>] in 1929-1930. "Directors, cutters, picture-people variously employed (scenarists, continuity editors, etc.), whose views were sought in course of conversation and discussion, also severely criticized the cutting. They wanted to know why Eisenstein cut back and forth so much and so fast. Soviet films have become known here as the pictures with 'choppy cutting'" . Some Hollywood critics viewed Russian editing methods as derivative of earlier, more "primitive" American efforts like D. W. Griffith's. Griffith's <i>Intolerance</i> clearly <i>was</i> an influential film for early Soviet filmmakers (<i>K</i>, 142-3; 210-2). But many American and British treatments of Soviet film have overstated Griffith's influence on Eisenstein at the expense of compatriots such as Lev Kuleshov and Dziga Vertov.

In her biography of Eisenstein, Oksana Bulgakowa notes that, by 1927, the phrase "Russian montage" was widely used overseas.

Anne Dwyer (1998; San Francisco: Potemkin Press, 2001), 83; hereafter abbreviated <i>SEB</i>.

See A. Dovzhenko, "My Method," related to L. Linhart and trans. by K. Santor, <i>Experimental Cinema</i> 5 , 23. Eisenstein claimed to have worked in a similar fashion. Struggling to explain to his American financial backers why he needed so much footage for a film that he was shooting in Mexico, the director wrote in 1932 that, for the making of his last masterpiece, <i>October</i> , he had had to "cut around 80,000 meters of footage to 2,100 meters" (<i>SEB</i>, 133-4).

For an account of Eisenstein's early formative exposure to Kuleshov, see Richard Taylor, "Eisenstein: A Soviet Artist," in <i>The Eisenstein Reader</i>, ed. Richard Taylor (London: British Film Institute, 1998), 3. Kuleshov was really the first Soviet filmmaker to write in a systematic way about montage. In a 1917 essay titled "The Tasks of the Artist in Cinema," he said: "The essence of cinema art lies in the creativity of the director and the artist: everything is based on composition. To make a picture the director must compose the separate filmed fragments, disordered and disjointed, into a single whole and juxtapose these separate moments into a more advantageous, integral and rhythmical sequence, just as a child constructs a whole word or phrase from separate scattered blocks of letters." See Lev Kuleshov, "The Tasks of the Artist in Cinema," in <i>RSCD</i>, 41. Eisenstein ultimately distinguished his method from Kuleshov's by claiming to have based his more dialectical montage principles on "collision" rather than on "linkage."

Vertov's reference to cinematic "hurricanes of movement" comes from his early essay, "WE; VARIANT OF A MANIFESTO" (<i>KE</i>, 9). Written in 1919, this essay was not published until 1922.

In his early manifesto, "WE," Vertov wrote: "WE are cleansing <i>kinochestvo</i> [new cinema methods] of foreign matter&#x02014;of music, literature, and theater; we seek our own rhythm, one lifted from nowhere else, and we find it in the movements of things. . . . Saws dancing at a sawmill convey to us a joy more intimate and intelligible than that on human dance floors" (<i>KE</i>, 7).

Feldman argues that Vertov's defining experiments "with cutting and motion" begin as early as 1919, during his assemblage of footage for <i>Kinonedelia #30</i> (4-5, 20). Vertov suggested something similar when he wrote in 1924: "My first experiments in assembling chance film clippings into more or less 'harmonious' montage groups belong to this period (of <i>Kinonedelia</i>)" (<i>KE</i>, 42).

Eisenstein was not the first Soviet filmmaker to have fooled journalists and historians with the verisimilitude of his filmic productions. In <i>The Last Bolshevik</i>, a film about the uses and misuses of cinema under Lenin and Stalin, the French filmmaker Chris Marker reveals that a respected French publishing house mistook a film-still taken from a 1920 theatrical staging of the storming of the czar's Winter Palace for an actual photograph of the epochal event. In <i>his</i> study, Marker locates the precise frame of the recreation film in question and he matches it to the historical photograph that graces the cover of the French book, <i>Histoire de la r&#x000E9;volution russe.</i> See <i>The Last Bolshevik</i> (France, 1993).

Mixed in with Lenin's reflections on the ideological uses of cinema were some fairly unambiguous instructions, including the following: "<i>the production of new films imbued with Communist ideas and reflecting Soviet reality should begin with the newsreel.</i>" Anatoli Lunacharsky served as Lenin's Commissar of Education during the early years of the Bolshevik regime. Many of Lenin's best known statements about the importance of cinema and of newsreel in particular have been taken from conversations recorded by Lunacharsky. See "Anatoli Lunacharsky: Conversation with Lenin. I. Of All the Arts . . . ," in <i>RSCD</i>, 57. Nonfiction film, Lenin knew, was important not only because it could reach those recalcitrant and often illiterate Russian peasants who resisted modernization and collectivization, but also because it spoke to the USSR's growing international audience&#x02014;a global body of sympathizers that was beginning to include artistic luminaries from America and from Europe.

Daniel Aaron and Townsend Ludington (New York: Library of America, 1996), 1268; hereafter abbreviated <i>USA</i>. Dos Passos admired Vertov's unplayed films, but, despite Vertov's welcoming observation in 1934 that "Dos Passos's work involves a translation from film-vision into literary language," the American writer seems to have had a poor grasp of the de-aestheticizing impulse that lay beneath Vertov's <i>Kinoki</i> project of 1924 (<i>KE</i>, 174). For example, the novelist used <i>The Camera Eye</i> sections of <i>U.S.A.</i> to represent the inner experience of characters, as in the following interior monologue delivered by a wounded twenty-one year old soldier: "the raindrops fall one by one out of the horsechestnut tree over the arbor onto the table in the abandoned beergarden and the puddly gravel and my clipped skull where my fingers move gently forward and back over the fuzzy knobs and hollows . . ." (<i>USA</i>, 420). In contrast to the surfacey <i>Newsreel</i> sections that represent the "common mind" through a barrage of newspaper headlines and snippets from popular songs, <i>The Camera Eye</i> offsets observers' interiors as precious dramatic spaces within <i>U.S.A.</i> Montage, or the art that Vertov described as a technologically driven "'theory of intervals,'" or as a more high flown "theory of relativity on the screen," is for Dos Passos a mechanism that preserves the traditional distinction between interior and exterior forms of consciousness (<i>KE</i>, 41).

Zukofsky wrote three essays on the Objectivist movement in 1930 and 1931. Two of these essays appeared in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1931; and the three together can be found in his collection of critical essays, <i>Prepositions +</i>. See Louis Zukofsky, <i>Prepositions +: The Collected Critical Essays</i>, ed. Mark Scroggins (1967; Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 2000), 12-8; hereafter abbreviated <i>P+</i>. The Pound/Zukofsky correspondence is also a good source for those interested in puzzling out Objectivism and its relation to Imagism. In his letters to Pound, Zukofsky discusses Objectivism as a poetic movement that turns on events, and consequently <i>history</i>, rather than on Imagist "things" (<i>PZ</i>, 71). William Carlos Williams also considers Objectivism in relation to Imagism in his autobiography. See <i>The Autobiography of William Carlos Williams</i> (1948; New York: Random House, 1951), 264-5; hereafter abbreviated <i>AWCW</i>. Like Zukofsky, Williams spoke of the Objectivist poem as an object in history (<i>AWCW</i>, 265). In doing so, he may have been suggesting that, in the late 1930s at least, writers of poems should share with their camera-laden partners the focussed social and political objectives of the documentarian. Pound's list of Imagist directives first appeared in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1913; it is reprinted in Ezra Pound, <i>Literary Essays of Ezra Pound</i>, ed. T. S.

Langston Hughes traveled through the Soviet Union for one year, beginning in June 1932. Together with twenty-two other African American writers, actors, and students, Hughes had been invited to Russia by the Meschrabpom Film Corporation to help make a film about race in contemporary America. By Hughes's own account, <i>Black and White</i> was based on a script that was deeply flawed from the start: "[The story] would have looked wonderful on the screen," Hughes conceded, "so well do the Russians handle crowds in films. . . . [But it] was not even plausible fantasy&#x02014;being both ahead of and far behind the times." See Langston Hughes, <i>I Wonder as I Wander: An Autobiographical Journey</i> (1956; New York: Hill and Wang, 2000), 79. Despite the Soviet state's large investment in this project, including its coverage of the expenses of visiting Americans, the film was never made. Hughes's impressions of his year in the USSR can be found in an essay entitled "Moscow and Me" . See Hughes's <i>Good Morning Revolution: Uncollected Writings of Social Protest by Langston Hughes</i>, ed. Faith Berry (New York: Citadel Press, 1992), 71-9. Hughes provides a lengthy and detailed account of his travels in the Soviet Union in the second volume of his autobiography, <i>I Wonder as I Wander</i>. During the early 1930s, even Ezra Pound was sanguine about the Soviet experiment; and he suggested to Zukofsky that the younger poet should visit Moscow.

Vertov rightly insisted that the "day in the life method" had been an integral part of his own aesthetic since 1924, several years before Ruttmann and Freund made <i>Berlin: The Symphony of a Great City</i> (<i>FS</i>, 90).

Eisenstein left Moscow accompanied by an assistant and a cameraman who were to help him glean information about sound film for the Soviet film industry. From the outset, in Berlin and in Paris, the Bolshevik artist seemed right at home in European modernist circles. He exchanged ideas with James Joyce, Kenneth MacPherson (the <i>Close Up</i> editor), Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard, as well as with Fernand L&#x000E9;ger and a host of other visual artists, many of whom were just beginning their own experiments with film (<i>SEB</i>, 94-106). After crossing the Atlantic, moreover, Eisenstein found "montage" to be a welcome new subject of inquiry at American universities. Beginning his long journey from Boston to Hollywood, he lectured at the Fine Arts Department at Harvard; co-taught a seminar with John Dewey at Columbia; and he spoke on montage to an appreciative audience at the University of Chicago (<i>SEB</i>, 108-9; <i>SE</i>, 165).

Michael Denning places Williams in the vanguard of those American writers who pushed the cause of proletariat literature during the 1930s (<i>CF</i>, 213-4). Story collections such as <i>The Knife of the Times</i>  and <i>Life along the Passaic</i> , Denning notes, read like "miniature versions of Dos Passos's <i>U.S.A.</i>" (<i>CF</i>, 213). During the decade when he devoted himself to fiction, working on a trilogy of novels together with these stories, Williams sharpened his ear for vernacular speech. It was Williams's commitment to representing particular classes and ethnic groups in history&#x02014;and to telling lost stories like that of the Paterson silkworkers' strike of 1913&#x02014;that led him to think about the role that documentary practices might play in his poetry. Even as he moved away from stories and novels and back toward the writing of poetry, Williams relied on his ear, strengthening his capacity to render the dialects that he encountered in New York and in his practice as a New Jersey physician. Among his preliminary drafts for <i>Paterson</i> are a series of vernacular sketches that he published in a collection called <i>The Broken Span</i> in 1941. Here, in a selection titled "<i>For the Poem</i> PATTERSON" [<i>sic</i>], Paterson, New Jersey emerges as an assemblage of working class voices: "Her milk don't seem to . . / She's always hungry but . . / She seems to <i>gain</i> all right/ I don't know"; "You are a typical American woman/ you think men grow on trees&#x02014;"; "Doc, I bin lookin' for you/ I owe you two bucks." Some of these voices eventually found their way into <i>Paterson</i>. See William Carlos Williams, <i>The Broken Span</i> (Norfolk, CT: New Directions, 1941), n.p.

The <i>LEF</i> writer Osip Brik was among those who suggested that nonfiction cinema should model itself after existing trends in Soviet literature of the 1920s: "[W]e want to achieve in cinema the same thing as in all our literary work, that is, to train people to value facts, documents, and not to value an artistic invention inspired by these documents. . . ." ("SOSD," 36) Some of the most generically inventive Soviet literature of the 1920s was published in the periodical <i>Red Virgin Soil</i>, a self-styled "literary and scientific-publicistic journal" begun in 1921 with the backing of luminaries including Vladimir Lenin and MaximGorky <i>(RVS,</i> 3<i>). Red Virgin Soil</i> featured documentary and ethnographic writings by correspondents including the <i>LEF</i> poet, Vladimir Mayakovsky; and it contained special sections for the reprinting of "newly discovered archival materials or memoirs" (<i>RVS</i>, 19). Because history itself seemed so consequential to Soviet readers and writers of that decade, nonfiction genres, including "the notebook, the diary, the travel memoir, and interpretive journalism" assumed a special prominence in the pages of <i>Red Virgin Soil</i> (<i>RVS</i>, 69).

Beyond <i>Paterson</i>, moreover, there extends a tradition of American collage poetry that includes the <i>Maximus Poems</i> of Charles Olson, a historical epic thick with quoted, and performatively <i>misquoted</i>, letters and documents, together with other distinctive writings, including those of Paul Metcalf, whose <i>Apalache</i>  narrates the settlement of North America's eastern reaches entirely through passages excerpted from other writers' texts. Blending the literary documentary tradition with contemporary 

<b></b>

critical theory and the avant-garde poetics of the LANGUAGE movement, Susan Howe is renowned among those who bring textual collage practices into the twenty-first century. In books like <i>Singularities</i> , and in essays on documentary filmmakers including Chris Marker and Dziga Vertov, Howe not only ensures that the historical collage text remains a vibrant component of American poetry, but she also points to its structural affinities with the theory and practice of nonfiction film. See Susan Howe, "Sorting Facts; or, Nineteen Ways of Looking at Marker," in <i>BD</i>, 295-343. In her essay, Howe places herself within a poetic documentary tradition that hinges on the associational assemblage techniques of, not only twentieth-century American writers like "T. S. Eliot, H. D., Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens, Charles Olson, and John Cage," but also those nineteenth-century writers&#x02014;Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, and Walt Whitman&#x02014;who "us[ed] montage before it was a word for a working method" (<i>BD</i>, 331). Howe's observations about the affinities between American writers and European and Soviet filmmakers have helped to spark my own study of the historical relationship between Soviet film and the twentieth-century American long poem.

Eisenstein's ideas about realism and proportion are central to his understanding of montage as a modern method of assemblage; see note 55. Most of his appreciation for the power of "pre-capitalistic" artistic directives stems from his study of traditional Japanese art forms and the Japanese ideogram. But the inventive director and theorist was also fascinated by the artistic and cultural traditions of Mexico. The lessons of disproportion, for example, resound in Eisenstein's assessment of "the weirdness, absurdity, disproportion, and scale" of the Mayan statues that he encountered by match-light in a blacked-out night museum in Chichen Itza. See Eisenstein's <i>Immoral Memories: An Autobiography</i>, trans. Herbert Marshall(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1983), 178. See also Inga Karetnikova and Leon Steinmetz, <i>Mexico According to Eisenstein</i> (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1991), 180-1. Inga Karetnikova's book contains a photograph of the director seated before, and almost within, a giant Mayan stone statue in another darkened museum, this one in Mexico City. (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) The photo suggests that, although Eisenstein never was able to edit his Mexican film footage, his theories of montage were fully alive for him while he was working in Mexico. The director and theorist seemed himself to be experiencing a liberating sense of "pre-capitalistic" "disproportion" among the men, women, and stones of that country.

<p class="endText">
<a name="FOOT55" href="#REF55">55</a>.
In his essay, "The Cinematographic Principle and the Ideogram" , Eisenstein compares montage methods to Japanese ideograms and to traditional Japanese art forms such as mask carving and Kabuki and No theater (<i>FF</i>, 28-44). Eisenstein argues here and in another essay, "The Unexpected" , that these "pre-capitalistic" forms preserve the emotional truths that are destroyed by realism, the conventional art system that attends capitalism (<i>FF</i>, 26-7). Much as capitalism brings with it a false consciousness regarding the truth of economic exploitation, realism brings with it a false set of visual and aesthetic standards. In Eisenstein's view, montage ruptures these standards, awakening eyes and minds, by setting static forms in conflict. One example that he provides comes from the Japanese ideogram for "scream." This compound picture word consists of two elements: a large, stylized mouth set beside a child's body. Placed in rapid sequence on the movie screen, pairs of disproportionate images like these might help a film to achieve an unprecedented emotional immediacy (<i>FF</i>, 28-30). This is how Eisenstein discusses his use of the stone lions in <i>Potemkin</i> in his essay, "A Dialectical Approach to Film Form." Here, the director lists and illustrates many different varieties of montage, including a subcategory of "<i>artificially produced images of motion</i>." According to Eisenstein, the stone lions provide "illogical" examples of such "<i>images of motion</i>" (<i>FF</i>, 55). It is "illogical" to suggest that an icon literally made of stone would be so moved by a massacre that it has to stand and roar in protest; but it is also a sign of the expressive range of montage. Marie Seton also discusses the stone lions in her biography of the filmmaker. According to Seton, the director was out scouting scenes with his cameraman, Eduard Tisse, when the two discovered a set of three lion statues in a garden at a former czar's palace in Alupka. Tisse was initially more excited than Eisenstein about the possibility of filming and combining shots of the three statues. Once the lions had been filmed, however, Eisenstein saw that he could achieve a powerful effect by arranging the three shots&#x02014;the sleeping lion, the awakening lion, the rising lion&#x02014;in sequence against the silent thunder of the <i>Potemkin</i>'s firing guns. He discovered that, by correctly calculating the length of the second shot, which needed to be longer than the other two, the marble would "become dynamic" and "even [the] stone [could be made to] cr[y] out in protest" (<i>SE</i>, 83).

The conflict between Sinclair and Eisenstein over the editing of <i>Que Viva Mexico!</i> is chronicled in a number of places. Seymour Stern and other leftist critics took Eisenstein's point of view in a series of articles about the incident that were published in <i>Experimental Cinema</i>. <i>Hound and Horn</i> publisher Lincoln Kirstein turned a memorable phrase when he said, in 1932, that it would be "staggering" to "rob" <i>Que Viva Mexico!</i> of "Eisenstein's final fingering" (quoted in Seton, <i>SE</i>, 236). Other accounts sympathetic to Eisenstein include Oksana Bulgakowa's biography of the director. Eisenstein himself was wisely circumspect regarding the incident. That the director should have been deprived of the opportunity to edit his own footage seems wrong, but some versions of the incident do portray Sinclair's side of the story, making his actions seem understandable if unjustified. For accounts that cast a soft light on Sinclair, see the novelist's own autobiography, <i>American Outpost: A Book of Reminiscences</i> (New York: Farrar and Reinhart, 1932). See also <i>Sergei Eisenstein and Upton Sinclair: The Making and Unmaking of Que Viva Mexico!</i>, eds. Harry M. Geduld and Ronald Gottesman (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1970).

<i>Paterson</i> invokes its normative Anglo-Saxon reader through the very immigrant vernacular voices that negatively establish an Anglo-Saxon measure for Americanness. In <i>American Outpost</i>, Upton Sinclair spoke proudly of the "good hard shell of Puritanism" that "protect[ed] [him] against the black magic of the modern Babylon." On the very next page he made his first mention of his surprising involvement with "an Eisenstein moving picture" (Sinclair, <i>American Outpost</i>, 88-9). Sinclair seems to have been both fearful and respectful of the power of Eisenstein's montage method. In a 1931 letter to L. I. Monosson of Amkino, he acknowledged that "much of Eisenstein's work depends upon cutting and arrangement; see <i>Sergei Eisenstein and Upton Sinclair,</i> eds. Geduld and Gottesman, 86-7.

In the early to mid-1930s, when Eisenstein returned to Moscow from Mexico, Stalin's aesthetic purges had begun to coincide with sexual reforms. In March 1934, the Soviet Union passed a law that made homosexuality a punishable offense. Large numbers of artists were among those arrested for sexual offenses in major cities like Moscow, Leningrad, Odessa, and Kharkov (<i>SEB</i>, 165-6).

Neither Swinburne nor his writings are normal or ordinary. "Demoniac youth," Ruskin called him, and to Maupassant he was "the most extravagant artistic person alive in the world today."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Descriptions like that recur in the numerous contemporary reports, though many also express horror at the person Georgiana Burne-Jones called "the most poetic personality I have ever known."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  So Bayard Taylor observes that "I admire in him . . . the mad, unrestrained preponderance of the imagination. It is a god-like quality, but he sometimes uses it like the devil. . . . He told me some things, unspeakably shocking, which he had omitted from his last volume." (<i>CH</i>, 7) Excepting his love for children and old people, few things about Swinburne seemed "appropriate," to appropriate a commonplace of our preposterously careful and standardized age. He even looked odd. Georgiana Burne-Jones recalled "the flame-like beauty of his wavy mass of hair, his swift speech and extraordinary swiftness of thought and apprehension, and a certain delightful inconsequence all his own." Most "unforgettable" were his piercing green eyes and the ways he moved: "When repeating poetry he had a perfectly natural way of lifting [his eyes] in a rapt, unconscious gaze. . . . 'Looks commencing with the skies' expresses it without exaggeration. He was restless beyond words, scarcely standing still at all and almost dancing as he walked." (<i>CH</i>, 6)

<p>
The writings are as arresting as the man. He composed as easily in French as in English, and nearly as easily in Greek, Latin, and Italian. Probably Tennyson is the only poet after Pope who possessed his extraordinary prosodic and literary skills, and Tennyson cannot match the range of Swinburne's work. His critical 


<b></b>


and speculative prose, though still largely inviolate, is seminal and made Pater's and Wilde's work possible; he is a major writer of fiction, as Edmund Wilson would discover late in his life; and with his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he passed along to Ezra Pound a theory and practice of poetic translation that was crucial for the Modernist program. All this is accomplished within a clearly defined intellectual framework that was also, for him, a mission. He meant to establish the practice of Imagination at the center of cultural life. His idea of Imagination is Shelleyan&#x02014;that is to say, it is moral, comprehensive, and committed to social transformation. Also like Shelley, he directed his work to the arena of ideology and the forms of belief that society's ideological apparatuses, especially the schools and the churches, promote and maintain. But he is far more like Byron in seeking a broad public engagement with his secular humanism. He made himself and his work a sign of contention. 

<p>
He was fearless, immensely gifted, and unswerving in this work. But he was expelled from our schools in the twentieth century. The expulsion was understandable given the cultural program to which academic modernism devoted itself between approximately 1920 and 1965. Recent well-known revaluations of that program have begun to study its police-keeping work and restore attention to the true range of what is involved&#x02014;is still involved&#x02014;in modernism and modernity. In that context Swinburne's aesthetic program, both theory and practice, is a great, neglected cultural and scholarly obligation.

The Life

<p class="noIndent">
In February 1875 the American poet and critic E. C. Stedman asked Swinburne for an account of his "birth and career." Swinburne was then the most celebrated (and excoriated) poet in England, and his fame on the continent and the United States was equally broadcast. 

<p>
The poet replied with a long letter&#x02014;an impressive example of his marvelous prose, and important as an index to the salient features of his life as he saw them or wanted them seen.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  The letter is a kind of mid-life Memoir written neither as an advertisement for himself nor as a scandalous confidence. For latter-day persons interested in Swinburne, it should probably be read before any other account of the man. While the letter refers to Byron several times, Swinburne is aware that his is not, like Byron's, an eventful life. What concerns him are ideas, writing (poetry in particular), and issues of character (especially as these descend to him through his family). With quiet verve Swinburne declines any "Rousseau-like record of . . . emotions." As to important dates he simply remarks: "knowing as you do the dates and sequence of my published books you know every event of my life." To this one might add only that Swinburne's unpublished work&#x02014;much of it even yet unprinted&#x02014;would also interest an interested person. 

<p>
Swinburne did not wake on 16 July 1866&#x02014;the day that his <i>Poems and Ballads</i> appeared&#x02014;to find himself instantly famous, as Byron had on the day <i>Childe Harold: A Romaunt</i> was issued in 1812. But the mixed blessing of his fame spread quickly from that day&#x02014;from that book&#x02014;forward. "A very great poet has arisen in England," the 


<b></b>


historian W. H. E. Lecky wrote to a cousin shortly after the book appeared, and "All literary London is now ringing with [the book's] genius . . . blasphemies and indecencies."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  He became a wonder, a terror, and finally a catalyst for great social and cultural change. Ruskin's ambivalence is worth recalling:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For the matter of it&#x02014;I consent to much&#x02014;I regret much&#x02014;I blame or reject nothing. I should as soon think of finding fault with you as with a thundercloud or a nightshade blossom. All I can say of you or them&#x02014;is that God made you, and that you are very wonderful and beautiful. To me it may be dreadful or deadly&#x02014;it may be in a deeper sense, or in certain relations, helpful and medicinal. There is assuredly something wrong with you&#x02014;awful in proportion to the great powers it affects, and renders (nationally) at present useless.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Most readers troubled by the book had lost such power of reflection. The <i>London Review</i> called it "depressing and misbegotten&#x02014;in many of its constituents. . .utterly revolting" (<i>CH</i>, 35). <i>The Athenaeum</i>: "unclean for the sake of uncleanness" (<i>CH</i>, 31). <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>: "mad . . . indecency" (<i>CH</i>, xx). And so forth. Swinburne's publisher (Edward Moxon) was so frightened by the virulence of the abuse that he broke off publication and passed the copies on hand to John Camden Hotten, who brought out five more editions. (At that point, 1875, Swinburne turned to a new publisher, Chatto and Windus, who would reprint the book no less than forty times between 1875 and 1916.) 

<p>
The scandalous success of <i>Poems and Ballads</i> is precisely the <i>text</i>onic center of "The Life of Algernon Charles Swinburne" both in its contemporary and in its posthumous unfolding. His life in letters was his life, as he told Stedman. But so shocking was the advent of this epochal book that it would come to obscure the range of Swinburne's work&#x02014;a range so extensive that one can sometimes scarcely imagine how it came to be thought narrow or precious.

<p>
To many the book represented the best that was known and being thought in the world at that moment in history. William Michael Rossetti, that steady and sane radical, spoke this point of view better than most:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Swinburne's superiority over his contemporary poets, with the sole possible exception of Tennyson . . . lie[s] in his mastery of all the literary or artistic resources of poetry. . . . As to blasphemy, Swinburne is certainly a pronounced antichristian, and something very closely resembling an atheist; I consider that he is right in entertaining these or any other speculative opinions which commend themselves to his own mind, and expressing them as freely as Christians, Mohammedans, etc., express their speculative or traditional opinions. As to indecency [I do not think] his writings are likely to do any practical harm to anybody fitted by taste and training to admire them.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The intensity of Swinburne's work does not encourage that kind of intellectual clarity, though in many respects it does assume it. In this respect&#x02014;as in some others&#x02014;Swinburne comes to his age as Jesus came to his, bringing not peace, but a sword. Unlike Rossetti, he took a mischievous delight in upending settled minds, as one sees 


<b></b>


in his superb comic, satiric, and parodic verse. Writing to Joseph Knight about the attack in the <i>Athenaeum</i> Swinburne says: "I have exhausted myself with a quasi-venereal enjoyment of th[at] incomparable article." (<i>PL</i>, 136) Rossetti wrote a judicious pamphlet in praise and defense of his friend, <i>Swinburne's Poems and Ballads</i>. Swinburne's reply, the unrepentant and derisory <i>Notes on Poems and Reviews</i>, simply institutionalized himself with his antagonists as the re John Morley called "the libidinous laureate of a pack of satyrs" (<i>CH</i>, 29).

<p>
Two other sets of events, the second following upon the first, dominate the mythology of Swinburne's life. In June 1878 Theodore Watts-Dunton, finding the poet in a desperate physical state, took him from his rooms in London to Watts-Dunton's house in Putney. The action probably saved Swinburne's life. His health had been deteriorating for some years, largely from his reckless abuse of alcohol. Stories about his outrageous public behavior were circulating from the mid-1860s, and gossip carried further tales of moral depravity. Many of his friends and acquaintances were notorious characters themselves, like Richard Monkton-Milnes, the sophisticated collector of strange books and strange persons and the man who introduced Swinburne to the works of Sade. Rumor had it (correctly) that Swinburne liked to frequent a certain brothel in St. John's Wood where flagellation was a specialty of the house. Swinburne was, it seems, never the worse for these visits, but his drunkenness was another matter.

<p>
Contemporary scandal grew rife during the 1870s and did much to convince a public mind that Swinburne was simply a diseased creature, body and soul. The disease took one form in Swinburne's writings and conversation, another in a disgraceful life, and the gathering set of scandalous events came to define the man and, through that definition, the work. To the practical friend and lawyer Watts-Dunton, however, Swinburne in 1878 was simply in mortal physical danger from his alcoholism. So he took Swinburne to his house and initiated what would come to be known as the Putney Years, which lasted till the poet's death in 1909. Admirers of Swinburne's work often bemoan the bland regimen that Watts-Dunton installed for his friend over the next thirty years, but few doubt that he saved the poet from untimely death. If his gift of imagination after the early 1880s shows a tailing off, as it does, the Putney Years nonetheless produced a handful of marvelous and even innovative works, and they left Swinburne the opportunity to set his literary house in order, which he did when he carefully prepared his 1904 collected edition of the poems and plays. 

<p>
To study Swinburne's personal life is to study a soul that looms strange even today. Such investigations doubtless have use, though they can impede our view of Swinburne's literary and cultural significance. Yet two distinctively personal matters are important even in the latter context.

<p>
First, Swinburne had a capacity for ecstatic, physical sympathy with elemental nature. His love of swimming and especially "the unplumbed, salt estranging sea" was boundless and it supplied him with a type of phenomenal awareness that is perhaps unique in English literature.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Only Ovid and Lucretius have left us equivalent literary records of the infinite, majestic universe that quantum mechanics would shortly begin to explore in functional terms.


<b></b>


<p>
Second, Swinburne was a quick scholar and a refractory student. He never finished his schooling at Eton or Oxford. What Captain Harewood says to his son Reginald in Swinburne's remarkable novel <i>A Year's Letters</i> (written 1861-1862) is brief and to the point: "you set at nought all guidance."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  His command of language, of many languages ancient and modern, was complete, and while he endured instruction in those quarters as a boy, he broke for independent study as quickly as he could. 

<p>
In intellectual matters Swinburne frightened and appalled partly because he was so formidably armed for discussion and dispute, and partly because he had&#x02014;as everyone reports&#x02014;a dauntless spirit. We want to remember that he set a face of flint against an immensely powerful ideological regime. Religion, in particular Christianity, dominated English society and culture in the nineteenth century, and England dominated the world. Those who chafed against these spiritual dominions hailed the lucid force of Swinburne's <i>non serviam</i>, which even yet has a majesty about it and continued importance. "Reckless and ungoverned" was the judgment of those who lacked his purpose "to follow knowledge like a sinking star/ Beyond the utmost bounds of human thought."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  He undertook that pursuit by plunge and engulfment. Knowing "at an inner stand-point" was how his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti described this kind of intellectual discipline.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  To think and to write from that vantage entails&#x02014;we see this clearly in Swinburne's writing&#x02014;the near complete disappearance, absorption or extinction, of Romantic subjectivity. Swinburne's work is Romantic but it is not subjective. 

<p>
All of this impinges directly on Swinburne's writing and cultural significance, as T. S. Eliot understood. In 1920 Eliot published a brilliant and influential critique of Swinburne's poetry in order to exorcise the demon of Swinburne's "genius," which remained at that time a commonplace word to describe Swinburne. "Only a man of genius could dwell so exclusively and consistently among words as Swinburne," Eliot observed. But because "Language in a healthy state presents the object, is so close to the object that the two are identified," Swinburne's language is astonishing but decadent: "merely the hallucination of meaning . . . language . . . uprooted."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  A superb sleight of hand returns us to the diseased Swinburne, the affront to "current notions of decency and dignity and social duty" (<i>CH</i>, 22). Those are John Morley's words in 1866. But the health of culture is always in jeopardy from unheard melodies and Swinburne was not a normal or ordinary poet. So against Swinburne's "morbidity of language" Eliot sets "the language which is most important to us [and] which is struggling to digest and express" itself in 1920.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In our hindsight we have come to understand the language prized by Eliot as "High Modernism": that is to say, a modernism as intent on purity as were the hostile reviewers of <i>Poems and Ballads</i>. Always a certain kind of purity. Gertrude Stein, key modernist though she is, did not write in Eliot's language, and her case is far from a special one.

<p>
Eliot's essay is a reading of Swinburne's "life" very much in the same spirit that the author lived it. Eliot reads him, that is to say, for his cultural significance. It is a highly critical reading&#x02014;as we should expect from a man who had his own (Anglo-Catholic) cultural program to promote. That was the center of his life. 


<b></b>


<p>
The reading that may be "most important to us" now, however, at a new century's turn, is perhaps Henry Adams's reading. Adams met Swinburne in 1862 at one of Monkton Milnes's famous dinner parties. Milnes had just "discovered" Swinburne, who had to that point published only some undergraduate work, a book of verse plays, <i>The Queen Mother and Rosamund</i> , and a few recent poems. No expectations, friendly or hostile, set Adams up for this encounter with the poet just coming into full command of his powers. Adams recounted the event in a book full of memorable passages and events, none more so than this one. Swinburne held the five dinner guests spellbound "far into the night, listening to the rush of [his] talk. In a long experience, before or after, no one ever approached it; yet one had heard accounts of the best talking of the time, and read accounts of talkers in all time, among the rest, of Voltaire, who seemed to approach nearest the pattern." Swinburne held forth with commentary and recitation, his own poetry as well as declamations of "a play of Sophocles or a play of Shakespeare, forward or backward, from end to beginning; or Dante, or Villon, or Victor Hugo." For Adams, it was like hearing a voice from "millions of ages" beyond them. The experience was a defining event for Adams and for <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> as well. In Swinburne Adams saw that a human being might possess the kind of cultural power he glimpsed in Dynamo and Virgin. His sense of his own insignificance set a measure for what Swinburne represented:



<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Adams could no more interest Algernon Swinburne than he could interest Encke's comet. . . . The quality of genius was an education almost ultimate, for one touched there the limits of the human mind on that side; but one could only receive; one had nothing to give&#x02014;nothing even to offer.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>
 

<p>
The comment and reaction recall Ruskin's. More to the point, they reflect a central feature of Swinburne's greatest poetry, which is intense, overwhelming, and&#x02014;as Eliot said&#x02014;"impersonal." The work comes as if overtaken by some transhuman force, with the poet&#x02014;in Swinburne's own words&#x02014;"Now no more a singer but a song." Ruskin judged that in 1866 the voice could scarcely be heard, was "(nationally) quite useless." At the limit of the human mind, millions of ages beyond Ruskin and Adams. Swinburne's subjects no longer terrorize, however&#x02014;"Thank Somebody," as he used to say.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  So the writing is there, unburdened, "free at last," and perhaps finally useful to tormented nations that long ago found a place for the tormented Ruskin.

<p class="noIndent">
Neither Eliot nor William Empson were so interested in the high artifice of a poetry like Swinburne's as they were in the artifices of sixteenth and seventeenth-century English verse. Nonetheless, these two exemplary English modernists understood the core features of Swinburne's work, though both warned people away from it "because" (Empson observed) "its effects depended on a tradition that its [own] example was destroying."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  He is speaking of the tradition of "Metaphysical" poetry. But as a long 


<b></b>


line of inheritors shows, Swinburne was for that tradition, as Shelley might have said, both "destroyer and preserver." When Eliot remarked upon the "impersonal" character of Swinburne's writing and its immersion in "words" and "language" as such, he was connecting Swinburne to a tradition that Veronica Forrest-Thomson would later recall and recast in her brilliant revisionary presentation of twentieth-century poetry, <i>Poetic Artifice</i>. Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were also conscious practitioners of the same late nineteenth-century revival of a poetic artifice they derived, in great part, from a study of Dante, Petrarch, and their "circles"&#x02014;and in Swinburne's case, from the classical tradition that supported and the Elizabethan tradition that studied them. To Empson and Eliot these derivations seemed enervated and "decadent." Late twentieth-century poets&#x02014;formalists like James Merrill and John Hollander as well as experimental writers like J. H. Prynne, Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, and Forrest-Thomson&#x02014;take a very different view. For them, Swinburne in particular is decisively important, even a kind of touchstone. 

<p>
"People are oddly determined to regard Swinburne as an exponent of Pure Sound with no intellectual content," Empson dryly remarked. But the truth is that "as a matter of technique" Swinburne "is full of subdued conceits and ambiguities," and as a matter of content, his sensibility was of the intellectual sort which proceeds by a process of analysis."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Empson is right on both counts, as he is also correct to suggest that Swinburne (like Byron, we might observe) inherited and honored a legacy that his own practice was putting through a metabolic shift. 

<p>
To recover Empson's clarity we might begin with the most apparent of Swinburne's intellectual frames of reference: his large critical-historical analysis of Western culture. This analysis centers in a broad study of the cultural damage that followed upon the institutionalization of monotheist ideas and of Christian ideas in particular. Because Neo-Christianities define so much of modernism, particularly academic modernism, Swinburne represented a key ideological antithesis&#x02014;and a special abhorrence because his views were so clearly articulated.

<p>
His Shelleyan/Hugolian thought is that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. As such, they regularly stand in opposition to what St. Paul called the "thrones, principalities, powers, and dominions" that seek to control and rule the world. A paradoxical historical inversion turned the Church that Paul helped to establish into Western culture's governing ideological dominion. 

<p>
This view of Christianity was shared alike by Blake, Marx, and Swinburne. But whereas Marx followed Hegel in seeking emancipation through the social enactment of enlightened thought, Swinburne pledged allegiance to Blake and aesthetic tradition, where forces of ideology could be most sharply engaged. Not without reason did he stake his philosophical ground in the enlightened action of Sade, Blake, and Byron&#x02014;emancipators whose "sincerity and strength," as Swinburne remarked, are as much a function of their tragedies as of their triumphs, and should always be understood in aesthetic terms.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Both Sade and Byron lived legendary and (in Shelley's sense) Imaginative lives, of which their writings are in a sense the sacramental signs.


<b></b>


<p>
Poetry is the chief means for securing "freedom" (a talismanic Swinburnean word and idea) from forces that darken the spirit. Like Shelley, Swinburne constructs a history of the world through a recovery of its poetical touchstones. So he sees the period between the installation of official Christianity at Rome and the re-emergence of classical, humanist, and even pagan culture in the Italian Renaissance as a long, dark age. The Borgias and Villon are thus exemplary historical res, forecasting the humanist pagan renaissance that captured the imaginations of so many nineteenth-century Europeans: Heine, Hugo, Baudelaire, Wagner, Nietzsche, to name only the most prominent. Sade, Blake, and Byron are also key historical res for Swinburne: recent prophets of a freedom they foresee but, because of their socio-ideological inheritances, cannot fully possess. 

<p>
Sappho is pivotal for several reasons. Her historical position signifies that the humanist ideal is literally primal&#x02014;the "true" Alpha and Omega that monotheists would later refashion as "the Lord." The sexual translation of primal imagination from motherhood to fatherhood was as significant for Swinburne as the fragmentary condition of Sappho's poetical remains, left in tatters by the long Dark Age of Christian worship. Equally important was the shift of primal power from a mortal poet, Sappho, to an immaterial idea, God. For Swinburne (as for Blake), the worst consequence of Christianity was the replacement of institutional religion for individual imaginative life at the center of human social and interpersonal exchange. Swinburne regarded Blake's <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> as the greatest poem of the eighteenth century in large part because it had recovered a core truth: that God did not make the world but that human beings "animated. . .sensible objects" as gods and divinities and later, literally benighted, fell down and worshipped their own imaginative creations. "Thus began Priesthood," as Blake observes, "Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales" (plate 11). Swinburne's remarkable study <i>William Blake</i> develops its theoretical polemic for poetry out of a complex meditation on those basic ideas. 

<p>
Swinburne's writing is fundamentally "about" writing, poetry, and language, then, as Eliot remarks. But as has been said of Georges Perec, Swinburne's life was lived through and "in words."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  From Swinburne's perspective, to be thus languaged is the opposite of an Eliotic "uprootedness." A poem like "Hertha" explicitly offers imaginative expression, including the poem's own expression, as "The tree many-rooted" (line 96) that encompasses all of reality. Two features of poetry are especially crucial. 

<p>
First are its Ovidian capacities for infinite metamorphic change and transformation. Poetry is what Humberto Maturana and Francesco Varela have more recently described as an <i>autopoietic</i> system&#x02014;a living form that maintains itself by a continual process of self-extrusion. Poetry's reception history sets out the record of that process and is itself an essential part of the process. Swinburne's writing practice is thus "performative" of an <i>autopoiesis</i> whose "growth [has] no guerdon/ But only to grow." The contemporary relevance of Swinburne's work springs from its intellectual affinities with a quantum mechanical model of reality, on one hand, and postmodern <i>autopoietical</i> ideas on the other.


<b></b>


<p>
<i>Autopoietic</i> processes develop through elaborate feedback loopings, of which self-awareness is the most complex and important. Poetry's second great feature, dialectically related to the first, lies in its ability to reflect on itself, as it were. For Swinburne, no other human activity commands this power so fully as poetic work. Poetry's special privilege lies in what his friend and fellow artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, called poetry's "motive power": its obligation to approach its subjects from an "inner standing-point." In that view, enlightenment and understanding do not stand upon the ceremonies of ultimate meanings and ideas (the weak point in science and philosophy); they turn upon themselves, being part of an emergent poetic process. Swinburne's critique of Christianity, like Sade's late enlightenment, is historically determinate.

<p>
This process of self-reflection has been traditionally marked by what we call the poet's intentions and the reader's interpretations. In Swinburne's view, because intention and interpretation are themselves momentary and transformational events, imaginative writing exposes itself to its own impersonal character. In Swinburne we observe a drama of poetic subjectivity diffusing into the language as such&#x02014;a startling effect in his work (it is less so in Dante's) precisely because Swinburne consciously situates his writing in the historical afterlife of Romanticism. The conclusion to "Anactoria"&#x02014;one of Swinburne's, and the nineteenth century's, greatest poems&#x02014;explicitly argues and demonstrates this view of poetry.

<p>
This signature poem illustrates much that is characteristic of Swinburne's work. Like Rossetti, Swinburne brought his writing to maturity by radically modifying the dramatic monologue&#x02014;a verse procedure that dominates his <i>Poems and Ballads</i> volume. The form possesses two salient properties: an immersive textual environment defined as the inner standing-point of the poetic speaker; a non-subjective frame of reference. These features clear the poetic space for the reader, who is shifted slightly but significantly away from the kind of sympathetic encounter set up by the conventions of a Romantic poem. 

<p>
Swinburne wanted to devise a more engulfing poetic space where the three possible forms of poetic consciousness&#x02014;authorial, readerly, and fictive&#x02014;would gain their identities, paradoxically, by a process of regular loss and transformation. In "Anactoria," Sappho as dramatic speaker is the primary exponent of such a process through her desire for complete union with Anactoria. But in the poem's climax (lines 189-304) her ecstatic declaration reveals her personal desire to be an index or symbol of a world-encompassing union in which she too is absorbed. Sappho is swept up into her own vision of "memories," "metaphors," and a host of "travailing . . . New Things and old things" so that she can finally declare: "I Sappho shall be one with all these things" (line 276). The future tense is crucial, collapsing as it does the space between the historical Sappho and this nineteenth-century resurrection poem, where her prophecy gets fulfilled and literalized. 

<p>
Were this a traditional dramatic monologue, that literalizing process would abstract the poet from the poetic space and remove the reader to a position of judgment, a <i>spectator ab extra</i>&#x02014;as we see in that exemplary example of the form, Browning's "My Last Duchess." An economy of socio-psychological realism organizes this poetic space. 


<b></b>


Swinburne prevents that from happening by breaking the spell of the realist convention and establishing the work in an order of what Marjorie Perloff has called <i>Radical Artifice</i>. The poem's tropic extravagance and "Pure Sound" are the most recognizable signs of this radical artifice. So too are the repetitive set of rhymes that control the poem. But two outstanding moments are particularly spell-breaking, at the realist order, and spell-binding at the order of artifice. 

<p>
The most famous is lines 155-88, which were in fact not part of the poem as Swinburne originally wrote it. Often criticized as a gratuitous attack on Christianity, apt for Swinburne but out of character for Sappho, the passage is in fact a key poetic device for connecting Sappho to her nineteenth-century resurrection and inheritance. The passage is there to draw the (contemporary) reader into the poem's action, whether in sympathy or in horror does not matter. Like Sappho, the reader must become, this way or that, "one with all these things." 

<p>
The other passage, even more remarkable, has yet (remarkably) never been commented upon. In a dazzling spectacle of prosodic wit, Swinburne fashions lines 47-58 as a kind of mirror image and repetition of the immediately preceding lines 35-46. (He repeated this kind of tour de force on a more grand scale in <i>Tristram of Lyonesse</i>, a poem that, he said, was written on the same principles worked out in "Anactoria".) Reading the poem, are we to think that the passage illustrates Sappho at the magical height of her powers? As Swinburne showing off? Either "interpretation" might be offered, but both point toward a third that encompasses and transcends them. As in a sestina or other intricate poetic form, the lines suggest that language itself, as it were, possesses within itself an infinite capacity for mutation and transformation.

<p>
Accompanying this diffusion of poetic subjectivity into the energy field of the poem is a dissolution that threatens and challenges the reader as well. Readers mark their drunken passages through the verse as "Pure Sound"&#x02014;a remorselessly self-involved prosodic spectacle. This response, while true in a sense, is impercipient. The work might better be viewed in terms of Arnold's comment on Shakespeare, so much admired by Swinburne: "Others abide our question, thou art free."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Readers will look (in vain) for "meaning" if they believe that meanings should stay for readerly determinations. Swinburne's poetry regularly imitates life because, as in life, its meanings spread and mutate and transform under our own pursuit. Negotiating a poem by Swinburne requires a state of attention that can scarcely be maintained and that is, in any case, never sufficient. Even the simplest poems, like "The Garden of Proserpine," run away with us:

<blockquote class="poetry">

<br />
&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	Here, where all trouble seems

<p class="noIndent">
The poem's rhythm, stately but inexorable, locates places and things that immediately prove "doubtful": "Here"? Where is that? Is it the Garden of Proserpine&#x02014;and if we take it so, what is that garden, and where is it: in Sicilian fields of Enna, in the kingdom of Hades, in Italy, in Greece? Perhaps it is here in this poem&#x02014;or in poetry as such?&#x02014;that we are to locate ourselves. And who is speaking, who is this "I"? Proserpine? "The poet" ("Swinburne"?)? Besides, if the referential dimensions of the verse slip through our minds, what of the syntax? "Riot" is marked primarily as a noun but the play of syntax and line-termination suggest it might have been&#x02014;might still be&#x02014;a verb. And what do we&#x02014;what can we&#x02014;make of those possibilities? The enjambment at "seems" is another syntactic multiplier. Or consider the cunning ambiguities in lines 5-7: are those green fields (what fields?) being worked by these "folk" or are the fields active agents, growing in order to sow and reap the folk who are working them? And what of such "folk," what do they know of these "doubtful dreams of dreams"? Are we (readers) to take those meta-dreams as poetry? This poem? And if we do, what good is it to know of such meta-dreams, to enter them? What good is it not to know or enter? 

<p>
This text is relatively simple. Compared with (say) "Anactoria" it seems a mere piano exercise. Still, it exemplifies the all but intolerable demand made upon the reader by a typical Swinburne poem. To read him is to be reminded that a full awareness of even the simplest human experience is unachievable. One thinks of Blake, in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite" (plate 14).

<p>
Poetry is a machine for cleansing doors of perception. Swinburne is special not because he makes us acutely aware of, say, those "infinite mountains of light" perceived by the visionary Blake (<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>, plate 25), but because he makes a drama of our experience&#x02014;our knowledge&#x02014;of the apparition and evanishment of such phenomena. This drama involves curtailing the power of poetry's visual illusions&#x02014;that special door of perception, the eye, that had itself become a stumbling block by dominating, even (as in Blake) defining, perceptual experience. An inner standing-point is difficult to access through language when the perception's doors are patrolled by the eyes. In language, accessing the world through the eye&#x02014;what Pound called <i>phanopoiea</i>&#x02014;is to hold it at some kind of reflective distance. Swinburne's poetry of course deploys visual imagination everywhere. But if visualization is the sensory foundation for intellectual reflection in verse, as it is, the other senses are far more immersive and unmediated. When Swinburne forces the reader to negotiate language through its tactility and sound, he is moving to enlarge our perceptual resources. To speak of his verse as "Pure Sound" is to register Swinburne's critique of the dominance that visual imagination had gained in poetic theory and practice.

<p>
That critique, along with the reforming practices entailed by it, is perhaps Swinburne's greatest legacy to poetic tradition. Wallace Stevens's <i>Harmonium</i> is in large measure a lesson learned from Swinburne. The eye in that splendid book has become a moving point in a turning world, as "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" shows. It moves because it has been distracted to greater awareness by a pervading sensorium of other senses and sounds. And so Stevens can say, explicitly, that the "Theory" of his book is this: "I am what is around me." That is pure Swinburne:


<b></b>


<blockquote class="poetry">

&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;And the arrows that miss,

<p class="noIndent">
Swinburne's late so-called nature poetry&#x02014;works like "A Nympholept," "Neap-Tide," and "The Lake of Gaube"&#x02014;exhibit this immersive imagination in unmistakable terms. These poems recall what later scholars have named "The Greater Romantic Lyric," but they recall to recast, for when Swinburne's eye/I enters the natural world it gets engulfed. In that experience one does not so much "see into the life of things" as one is seen through that pervading life, the way Beatrice is finally seen through the pervading light of Dante's Paradise. 

<p>
The dissolution is scarcely to be observed, however, lest one imagine that it could be understood by being <i>seen</i>. It is understood, rather, by being undergone. To read these poems is necessarily to be swept away by tactile and auditional immediacies, which here assume the status of what Eliot famously called an objective correlative. The correlated object of the poem is elemental, "great creating Nature" as it is known not by a God-like observer but by a percipient creature plunged within. The Nature known is a quantum, not a Newtonian, Nature.

<p>
As demonstrative of Swinburne's work as those late poems are, his lighter verse, so-called, may be more enlightening. The pre-eminent Swinburne scholar Cecil Y. Lang regarded Swinburne as "the greatest parodist that English poetry has ever seen."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  There is more to this judgment than might immediately catch the eye since a great deal of Swinburne's work is clear parody. <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>, for example, is a serious parody as are most of the poems in <i>Poems and Ballads .</i> The parody "Dolores" is striking exactly because it balances so delicately (and forcefully) between earnest and jest.

<p>
But the parodies Lang had in mind were masterpieces like "The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell," "Sonnet for a Picture," and "Nephilidia" (which Swinburne published in his famous <i>Heptalogia</i>) as well as several others not included there, like "Poeta Loquitur" and "Disgust: A Dramatic Monologue." All this is very high order nonsense verse, which Swinburne often also practiced in private: in his unpublished flagellation farces, for instance, and in impish <i>jeux d'esprit</i> like his "Fragment of an address from S. Joseph to S. Mary":

Brilliant wit pervades even this little epigram, which is quite worthy of what Byron mock-seriously called "all those nauseous epigrams of Martial" (<i>Don Juan</i> I. St. 43). The couplet's domestic vulgate works the words "bloody," "kid" and "pigeon" into a critical travesty of the Christian economy and one of its central ideas: Jesus as sacrificial scapegoat.


<b></b>


<p>
Like "Dolores," "Poeta Loquitur" is parody raised to another order entirely. Great parody, Lang observed, does not simply involve a critique of its source. It becomes in a sense <i>one</i> with that source, fused with it "like that of anti-matter to matter".<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This type of fusion culminates in Swinburne's self-parodies "Nephilidia" and "Poeta Loquitur," where an authoritative idea about poetry&#x02014;that it should achieve a perfect unity of sound and sense, of form and content&#x02014;becomes comically realized. The consequence is an apparition of writing as pure performance, writing that seems&#x02014;we remember Auden&#x02014;to make nothing happen but itself. Playing that game with his language, Swinburne achieves what few poets would dare to (or know how to) undertake: a critical satire of poetry itself from an inner standing-point, that is, taking itself as exemplum. The theory of poetry motivated at an inner standing-point here discovers a kind of perfect form&#x02014;at once completely expressive and completely self-aware. These works do not "dwell in possibility," as Dickinson splendidly imagined for herself; they dwell in an actuality Stevens celebrated and longed for. They demonstrate/argue/perform <i>autopoietic</i> action, they make <i>Nothing happen</i>: as Stevens once observed, "The nothing that is not there and the nothing that is."

<p>
Comic writing is alone equal to such an aspiration, as we know from Ovid and Rabelais, from Chaucer, from Byron&#x02014;in our own day, from Ashbery, Merrill, Bernstein. Searching poems for their meanings, we often forget that in poetry, language is not a vehicle of reference but a ral gesture. To make that gesture is to give momentary form to a reality that persists "beyond the singing of the sea." The cunning prepositional wordplay in that famous line from Stevens could scarcely be more Swinburnean.

"Leni! Pity she's dead," Helmut Newton says in response to the news that Leni Reifenstahl has just died at the age of 101. "She once made me promise never to call her an old Nazi, you know."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Newton, the photographer who notoriously creates scenarios of sadomasochism and perversion for the display of high fashion escaped from Berlin in 1938, having already begun his apprenticeship as a photographer there. Although Riefenstahl's photographs are not as overtly erotic as Newton's and do not appear to play to perversions, there is nevertheless a continuity between their work. It was looking at the posed, arrested bodies in Riefensthal's <i>Last ot the Nuba</i> that prompted Susan Sontag's famous meditation on Riefenstahl's films and on fascist aesthetics in general.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The fascist choreography that governs movement and stasis in Riefenstahl's work, Sontag writes in "Fascinating Fascism," "flow[s] from (and justif[ies]) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, and extravagant effort" ("FF," 40), suggesting&#x02014;though not making&#x02014;a connection between such behaviors and psychosexual dispositions. Yet the implication is there. 

<p>
Drawing in all likelihood on Wilhelm Reich's <i>Mass Psychology of Fascism</i> (written in Germany in 1933; banned by the Nazis in 1935) as well as on Adorno's "Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda," Sontag's essay points both to the sublimation of sexuality, the transformation of libidinal energies into a "spiritual" force in fascism, as well as to its expression in an "orgiastic transaction" between leader and the masses ("FF," 41; 40). It is Reich who famously claims that fascism converts the "orgasm anxiety" of the "man subjected to authority" into an eternalized purity, while Adorno draws on Freud in his assertion 


<b></b>


that the source of Hitler's libidinal power over the masses is linked to infantile orality and promotes an "archaic regression."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  "Nazi art is both prurient and idealizing," Sontag points out, its aesthetics "exalt two seemingly opposite states: egomania and servitude" ("FF," 41).

<p>
In Sontag's scattered remarks concerning the psychosexual dimension of fascist art there are lingering echoes that connect the fascist aesthetic to masochism, an aggressive, oral stage perversion that indefinitely defers orgasmic satisfaction, and that, like fascism in Saul Friedlander's reading, "aestheticizes the erotic plane."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Sontag's description of a fascist choreography as one that "alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing" ("FF," 40), calls to mind that masochism "reveals the stillness in movement, the edge of Thanatos in Eros that aestheticizes the erotic into cold suspense and diverts sexuality from orgasm to an erotic contemplation at once frustrating and pleasurable."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  By way of its <i>tableaux</i> moments and its dialectic of stasis and motion, I would suggest, the fascist choreography has a great deal to do with the theatrical scenarios of masochism. In these scenarios, eros is de-sexualized, death sexualized, and repetition and control of central importance. 

<p>
Although we will return to this subject later, the psychosexuality of Riefenstahl's choreography is not my central concern. Sontag's essay has notably pointed the way to some of the rhetorical structures that govern Riefenstahl's work, a few of which I pursue, choosing to look to one feature in particular that suggests a boundary crossing between mediums. In Riefenstahl's filmmaking, this is the recurrent presence of <i>tableau vivant</i> moments&#x02014;or, more loosely, staged <i>tableaux</i>. Kracauer was the first to call attention to the <i>tableau</i> arrangements in her films, but the term is invoked repeatedly in conjunction with Riefenstahl's style.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Sontag's description of the fascist choreography as the alternation of motion with static posing likewise draws on an understanding of <i>tableau</i> moments and of their subsequent subsumption by the ongoing flux of film's images. In the course of examining <i>tableaux</i> in Riefenstahl's films and the rhythm of movement and stasis in which they participate, my essay positions aspects of Riefenstahl's visual style within a matrix of related cultural and aesthetic phenomena. With a "thicker" description of these formal features as its object, this essay places them within other artistic practices, including the baroque tragic drama, sculpture and dance, and finally, photography. By isolating moments in Riefensthal's work that feature the posed, static body, I seek to contextualize these moments artistically and historically, and to ask questions concerning the aesthetic and ideological freight they are made to carry.

1. Triumph of the Will: Tableaux and Trionfi
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>




<p class="noIndent">
In a self-described turn away from <i>Ideologiekritik</i>, Russell Berman's 1989 essay "Written Right Across Their Faces: Leni Riefenstahl, Ernst J&#x000FC;nger, and Fascist Modernism" initially locates its interest in "the rhetorical grounding of Riefenstahl's <i>&#x000E9;noniciation"</i> and, more broadly, in a rhetorical politics of fascist representation per se.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Understanding rhetoric as expressive of a "politics prior to ideological contents," 


<b></b>


Berman clusters his brief remarks on Riefenstahl's <i>Triumph of the Will</i> around the notion of a fascist practice as one that prioritizes visual in favor of verbal representation. Using Riefensthal as a lead-in to his essay proper&#x02014;a nuanced and evocative reading of J&#x000FC;nger's work within the context of competing types of modernism&#x02014;Berman's gaze, though soon averted from Riefenstahl, continues to linger on matters of rhetorical politics. Drawing on the ekphrastic impulse in J&#x000FC;nger's writing and ringing changes on the relations of language and image that reside in ekphrasis, Berman joins his voice to others who claim that the status of writing occupies a position inferior to that of the image in fascist textual practice. Betraying a general "antipathy toward the symbolic order" ("WRAF," 110), fascist textuality as read by Berman corporealizes writing, hence reduces "the distance between body and text" ("WRAF," 109; 116). Further, fascist artistic practice favors the respatialization that occurs when the temporality of language is abandoned in favor of the image&#x02014;in this case of the ideologically-inflected <i>Gestalt</i>. Along with this reference to Rosenberg, Susan Sontag, Lessing and even Thomas Mann are not far to seek in Berman's observations. "Fascism as the aestheticization of politics transforms the world into a visual object" ("WRAF," 115): appropriately, Walter Benjamin is also pressed into service.

<p>
Simultaneously evocative of painting, drama and sculpture, <i>tableau vivant</i> generally features the immobile, held pose of human actors. <i>Tableau vivant</i> is most familiar from the fashionable novels of the nineteenth century&#x02014;preeminently Goethe's <i>Elective Affinities</i> &#x02014;where they function as a diversion, a parlor game involving the static embodiment of well-known paintings. Their origins include the <i>tableau</i> moment in the bourgeois tragedy of the eighteenth century and the staged melodrama of the nineteenth, but earlier still the term occurs in descriptions of processions and open-air festivals held during the Italian Renaissance. A widely practiced public art form during this period, <i>tableaux vivants</i> were often staged on portable platforms carrying first relics or devotional statues and eventually supporting performances of scenes by live actors.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  While early instances were religious in nature, mythological allegory later became their favored subject: the fetishized body part that is the relic is replaced first by the statue, then by the living, posed and emblematic body of allegory. On this subject, too, Walter Benjamin is well-informed: as we recall from <i>The Origins of German Tragic Drama</i> (published in 1928), the triumphal procession involving <i>tableaux</i> was favored in Italy where "the <i>trionfi</i> were the dominant mode of the processions," inspiring similar formal structures in German tragic drama.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Here, too, language is subordinate to image, and the political function of tableaux is apparent: they enact the authority of the ruler and elicit public support. Not surprisingly, such <i>tableaux</i> occurred frequently in celebrations of cultural dominance, so it is hardly surprising, as Benjamin tells us, that they flourished in Florence under the Medici (<i>OCGD</i>, 119). During the Nazi period, workers participated in <i>tableaux vivants</i> for similar reasons.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 

<p>
Surely the infamous Nuremberg party rally is such a pageant, an occasion for the public display of power, a <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, indeed. In the motorcade sequence of Riefenstahl's film, Hitler's triumphal procession features his body&#x02014;primarily stationary&#x02014;in the rigid pose of a devotional statue or mythological re, this rigidity playing 


<b></b>


a vital role in the film's myth-making program. While the motorcade and traveling camera contribute to the illusion of a moving body, the camera favors shots of Hitler erect in an open car, gliding immobile through the cheering crowd. In <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, Hitler-as-icon signifies politically&#x02014;propagandistically&#x02014;just as the statuary and <i>tableaux</i> of Venetian <i>trionfi</i> did. Here Benjamin's observation on the rhythm of the German tragic drama (the <i>Trauerspiel</i>, or "mourning-play")&#x02014;derived from these <i>trionfi&#x02014;</i>is of interest. His description of its "irregular rhythm of constant pause, the sudden change of direction, and consolidation into new rigidity" (<i>OGTD</i>, 197) is noticeably echoed in Sontag's comment on movement and stasis in the fascist choreography, specifically in the alternation "between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing" mentioned above. Riefenstahl's film establishes its irregular rhythm as fast tracking shots of the crowd are cut with Hitler as icon and ef, both the fixed point around which the action revolves and the eroticized object of the look.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This quality of an ef that Riefenstahl's film imparts to the re of Hitler is something that Hans-J&#x000FC;rgen Syberberg must have noticed.

<p>
Steve Neale, too, has commented on this film's relation to baroque drama and its particular form of display. As he remarks of <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, "theatricality&#x02014;in all its artifice&#x02014;is crucial to the particular mode of spectacle to which I am referring here, a mode whose traditions stem from, and are exemplified by, Baroque painting, theatre and opera" ("NODAS," 68). In triumphal processions as described by Benjamin, language is reduced to a "caption, conjured up from the allegorical constellations in which the res are related to one another" (<i>OGTD</i>, 196). Language as caption is emblematic and "entire speeches sound as if they properly belong beneath an allegorical engraving" (<i>OGTD</i>, 196). Following the work of an earlier scholar, Carl Horst, Benjamin suggests that language in the German tragic drama of the baroque period is similarly ornamental, its dramatic structure "hidden" beneath ornamentation, specifically <i>tableaux vivants</i> in the form of the "staged <i>exemplum</i>, staged antithesis, and staged metaphor" (<i>OGTD</i>, 192). Here, too, language is respatialized and multiply eclipsed by the image, an image whose constituent parts include human bodies whose purpose is nevertheless significatory, if opaque. 

<p>
With reference to <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, Berman points out that the priority of the image is asserted in this film even when it features a series of political speeches, claiming that "the verbal character of speech in the film is always secondary to the visual spectacle and the image of the present speaker" ("WRAF," 10). Once again language is subsumed within the greater pattern of spectacle. Given the propagandistic character of the speeches, however, what strategies reduce language to a role of secondary importance? Granted, the speakers are but one aspect of the overall design of the frame&#x02014;"beneath an allegorical engraving," as it were, beneath the emblematic Reich's eagle&#x02014;but since they are political res, well-known, even controversial, how can their individual character be suppressed? Riefensthal manages this in a variety of ways. Rudolf Hess's speech, for example, is heard in voiceover over reaction shots of listeners as varied as Goebbels, a young child, and Hitler himself. Presented from a variety of angles that heighten visual interest, these faces register Hess's words visually, 


<b></b>


affectively, as their impact on his listeners. In the montage of diatribes that follows, each speaker is preceded by a title engraved with the glowing ornamental script of his own handwriting: here, too, writing is rendered as image. Repetition likewise has its effect, de-emphasizing duration and thus spatializing language as one by one, similarly framed by the camera, the speakers deliver their speeches at the podium. By various means, then, formal procedures produce what Benjamin, quoting Horst on baroque tragic drama, has called an "advance of the plastic arts into the territory of the rhetorical arts" (<i>OGTD,</i> 177).

<p>
While Riefenstahl's use of repetition and accumulation are fascist aesthetic strategies shared in common with the German baroque tragic drama, repetition is also one of the linchpins of masochistic scenarios, where repetition produces an "aesthetic coherence" of a fantasy that expresses infantile fixation, and promotes the behaviors that defer (orgasmic) resolution. What, then, of the image of the body in this articulation? In Sacher-Masoch's <i>Venus in Furs</i>, (female) characters assume <i>tableau</i> postures, freezing&#x02014;as Deleuze notes in his study of masochism&#x02014;into postures that connect them with statues, paintings, or photographs.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Riefenstahl's film similarly has recourse to <i>tableau</i> arrangements that feature the posed body, the body in arrested motion. It is not only Hitler whose "virile posing" is suggestive of a sculpture or icon: another notable instance involves the close-up of faces in the workers' brigade, arranged in sculptural bas relief, a frieze over which the tracking camera passes. Here is the fascist merger of body and artwork that Arno Breker's and Josef Thorak's sculptures unwittingly pursue to the point of self-parody.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  It will not be necessary to rehearse the many instances in this film in which the mass ornament submits human bodies to its geometry&#x02014;Kracauer's famous essay as well as his references to the "living ornaments" of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> has provoked much observation on this topic.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<p>
But relentless movement propels Riefenstahl's film forward. Within the containment provided by the "set" of Speer's monumental architecture, Riefenstahl's orchestrated, ornamental phalanxes seem to have lives of their own, their movement throwing immobility into relief and subsuming it within its flow. As Sontag suggests, movement in the "fascist dramaturgy" traces "grandiose and rigid patterns" that sweep up the static re into its "choreography" ("FF," 40). Interestingly, nearly fifty years earlier Benjamin had used similar language to suggest to his reader that the dramaturgy of the German tragic drama, the <i>Trauerspiel,</i> unfolds "in a spatial continuum which one might describe as choreographic" (<i>OGTD</i>, 95). What are we to make of these multiple echoes of Benjamin's analysis of the <i>Trauerspiel</i> in Sontag's description of fascist aesthetics? Could it be that Sontag&#x02014;an avid reader of Benjamin who imitated Benjamin's art of quotation&#x02014;had recourse to his descriptions of tragic drama's formal characteristics and inverted their significance?<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Whether or not this is the case, in both in the <i>Trauerspiel</i> and in <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, bodies posed and contained in arrangements function as images even when they are subjected to motion.

<p>
As I have suggested, Benjaminian allegory can be said to hold sway in the <i>tableau</i> insofar as it is a mixed mode, a boundary crossing of several arts: alluding once again to Horst, Benjamin reads allegory as revealing a "crossing of the borders into a different 


<b></b>


mode" (<i>OGTD</i>, 177). <i>Tableau vivant</i> as a layering of mediums implies a transgression of organic unity in the manner of German tragic drama. In the <i>tableaux</i> scenes of tragic drama, the actor's body is arrested in motion and rendered sculptural; the allusion to, if not direct imitation of, paintings or iconographic scenes from mythology or the Bible render narrative by means of the image. Ultimately plastic, because enacted by human res, the <i>tableau</i> reduces narrative to a spectacle supported by the body. Conversely, <i>tableau</i> scenes also render the body as text, a tendency that Berman reads in the ekphrastic cast of fascist textuality.

<p>
For the German reader in particular, Lessing's preference for writing over the image is not far to seek in Berman's discussion.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  For Benjamin, however, the baroque tragic drama's allegorical tendency makes it a productively mixed mode: it is at one and the same time linguistic and imagistic, both corporeal&#x02014;tied to bodies&#x02014;and rooted in history. The Christian origins of German tragic drama allow corporeality&#x02014;Christ as man&#x02014;to guarantee both its immanence and its reflection of temporality as transitoriness. In contradistinction, Riefensthal's <i>Triumph of the Will</i> is engaged in staging history and rendering it myth. It will come as no surprise that what distinguishes the German tragic drama irrefutably from fascist art is its mode of structuration, its reliance on the fragment as the producer of meaning. If scenes of violence, cruelty, and death are so frequently represented in these plays, Benjamin suggests, it is because "the human body could be no exception to the commandment which ordered the destruction of the organic so that true meaning, as it was written and ordained, might be picked up from its fragments" (<i>OGTD</i>, 216).

<p>
As remarked above, bodies in <i>Triumph of the Will</i> are often subsumed within the ornamental patterns that characterize its style. By promoting the part only in relation to the whole, Riefenstahl's film contains and neutralizes the heterogeneity of <i>tableaux</i> moments. As Steve Neale suggests, the film's markers of theatricality do subvert its unity, they do not contribute to a self-consciousness that disrupts and critiques. They are&#x02014;on the contrary&#x02014;contained by this unity ("NODAS," 77). Needless to say, the generative principle, the anti-Eisensteinian principle of accretion that governs Riefenstahl's editing style has as its model an organic theory of art whose governing structure is wholeness. As in a kaleidoscope, patterns within this film change yet in some sense remain constant: in substituting for narrative, movement and editing merely replace one form of spectacle with another. It is the film's dynamism, then, that simulates wholeness, and the inexorability of its motion suggests that it is an erotic energy that propels the film forward. 

<p>
If it can be said of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> that it has a choreography as well as a dramaturgy, that it plays off stasis against motion, then Nietzsche's <i>Birth of Tragedy</i>  may not be far to seek. One of the texts that serves as a foil for Benjamin's treatise on the German tragic drama, Nietzsche's reading of Greek tragedy supplements the "noble simplicity and serene grandeur" that the German tradition had predominantly read in Greek antiquity from the time of Winckelmann's writings on sculpture with its opposite: a dionysian (erotic) energy. As is well-known, Nietzsche locates the dionysian aspect of Greek tragedy&#x02014;the affective urges and the dynamic principle 


<b></b>


of art&#x02014;in the chorus, in music, whereas the apollonian principle of form is allied with sculpture. Their dialectical relation opposes the (apollonian) containment of form in composed, static images with the dynamic, ecstatic (dionysian) energy of dance. In some sense, it may be the "amorous struggle" between these two principles&#x02014;to use Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's phrase&#x02014;that <i>Triumph of the Will</i> and, indeed, Riefenstahl's choreography more generally, expresses.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

2. Body Art: Sculpture and Dance
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The paradigm for German thinking concerning both sculpture and Classical antiquity famously emerges with J. J. Winckelmann's <i>Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Art in Painting and Sculpture</i>, published shortly before he left Dresden for Rome . In Dresden, Winckelmann's viewing of classical sculpture, while confined to plaster casts, nevertheless produced very vivid experiences in their spectator. The most famous of Winckelmann's meditations is centered on the Laoco&#x000F6;n sculptural group that evoked the often-cited "noble simplicity and serene grandeur" that would eventually propel much of Europe into neoclassicism. Here Winckelmann focusses on the way in which the smooth contours and the restrained pose of Laoco&#x000F6;n's sculptural body contain his pain, reading this containment as expressive of the noble Greek soul.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Winckelmann's attitude toward the physical body notably changes after his arrival in Rome, however, where his encounter with the Belvedere Apollo results in enraptured, homoerotically-tinged ekphrasis in which the spectator describes himself as transported, possessed by the beauty of the god. Despite all claims to the contrary, Winckelmann's description seems not to transcend a physical fixation on the beautiful male body. When Winckelmann is moved affectively at the sight, his experience prompts an ecstatic prose that animates and corporealizes the sculpture. Between them, Winckelmann's seminal texts suggest a spectrum of reactions to the sculptural body in which the spiritual attitude is favored, but physical response is incompletely sublimated. 

<p>
Riefensthal's first appearance in film is as Diotima in Arnold Fanck's <i>The Holy Mountain</i> , a clich&#x000E9;d amalgam of Winckelmannian neoclassicism and romantic motifs.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In Fanck's film, Diotima's dwelling place is the space where mountain cliffs drop down to meet the ocean's waves, conjuring up the Diotima of H&#x000F6;lderlin's <i>Hyperion</i> (1777-79) as well as her model, the priestess in Plato's <i>Symposium</i> whose role is to explain both the nature of love as well as the connection between the beautiful body and the ideal. In <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, Riefenstahl as Diotima expresses herself through dance as editing links her movements to the sea, the (female) element to which her pantheistic dance is dedicated. Like Venus, Diotima is seemingly born of this element and expresses its natural rhythms by way of her own. At once idealized and eroticized, Riefensthal's body participates in a narrative which moves toward&#x02014;but fails to achieve&#x02014;the formation of an ideal couple: desire for the character played by Luis Trenker, conflated with the (male) space of the sublime mountain peak, motivates Diotima's second dance. At times, the film fixes both characters in sculptural poses, backlit against 


<b></b>


the landscapes with which they are identified. Following the tradition that emerges from Winckelmann's thinking, the beautiful body is the posed body, its contours in harmonious balance, while dance and a graceful athleticism define the movement that Fanck's film demands of its characters. Expressive bodily movement and the sculptural pose continue to be central to Riefenstahl's acting in the feature films of her own directing.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 

<p>
Even more prominently, Winckelmann's ideas form a backdrop for the prologue of Riefenstahl's <i>Olympia, Part I</i> , where attitudes towards classical antiquity are re-shaped to conform to Nazi ideology, and the dialectic of movement and stasis finds an overtly political expression. In this astonishing sequence, movement develops out of stillness as classical statues are brought, Pygmalion-like, to life. Shot on location by Willy Zielke at the Poseidon Temple, the Parthenon and Ereichtheion on the Acropolis, at Cape Sunion and Corinth, and at the National Museum in Athens, it features the authentic statuary of Greek antiquity, not the plaster casts or Roman copies with which Winckelmann was familiar.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 

<p>
As usual, the choice of images and the editing were Riefenstahl's own: Zielke complained bitterly that "she did only what she had thought out at the editing table, [it was] theoretical," and that her editing style had ruined his material.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Out of material shot on location, the prologue creates the feeling that Zielke refers to as "something imaginary, it has no tempo, it is hundreds of years long, Greece, soul, mythology" (<i>LRAO</i>, 157). It is precisely this dreamlike, out-of-time representation of Greece as origin that make this prologue an ideal illustration of Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's "The Nazi Myth."

<p>
Appearing as engraved inscriptions on stone tablets, the opening credits of <i>Olympia, Part I&#x02014;</i>including the director's name&#x02014;hubristically link the art of film to the most notable achievements of Greek architecture and sculpture, providing an even more convincing example of the subsumption of writing by the image than the subverted script in the prologue to <i>Triumph of the Will</i>. What is presented here is filmic ekphrasis, with the camera visually rendering inscription for the spectator. Lyric poetry per se is thought to have originated in the ekphrastic epigrams and inscriptions collected in the Greek Anthology, poetic forms which have resonance in German writing through and beyond Rilke. Riefenstahl's film thus proclaims itself a participant in the tradition of ekphrastic writing and in the <i>paragones&#x02014;</i>or battle of the arts&#x02014;within which this genre situates itself. Although writing&#x02014;it should be noted in qualification of Berman&#x02014;usually triumphs over the image in ekphrastic poetry ("WRAF," 113-4), here the camera's writing renders the archaicized letters as embedded in the scene. Film as the art of technology emerges triumphant. From the start, then, it is suggested that pre-modern and modern modes of representation are continuous, reconciled.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
The camera's insistent and progressive motion as it generates a space around and through the ruins of classical antiquity serves symbolically to reassemble them, creating wholeness out of fragmented ruin. Larger fragments are superimposed upon smaller, and the camera's power is revealed to be formative as it progresses from a single column to the Parthenon in its entirety. The camera's constitutive function is similarly 


<b></b>


revealed as the (fascist) devices of repetition and expansion include the shooting of one object from multiple perspectives, as though to give the object shape, to present it in its three-dimensional plasticity. Since transitions between shots are in the form of dissolves, some as long as eight or ten seconds (<i>LRAO</i>, 157), the film suggests that it proceeds by way of a layering of images, by accretion rather than by means of the cuts that stress fragmentation. 

<p>
If the epilogue of Benjamin's <i>Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>, published in 1935, responds to the aestheticized politics of <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, the prologue to <i>Olympia, Part I: Festival of the Peoples</i> seems conceived to refute Benjamin's analysis and to substantiate its epilogue. Contradicting Benjamin's understanding of the cinematic medium as necessarily fragmentary, Riefensthal's prologue deliberately serves to ally film with idealist artistic practice. Fragmentation is scorned, and the evocatory power of the ruin elaborated in Benjamin's <i>Trauerspiel</i> treatise is rejected in favor of reconstruction. Both the camera's powers and the mode of editing are regenerative, bringing to life a culture that lies in ruins.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Since the bridge to that culture is created via the body, its images serve to substantiate Rosenberg's contention that the Aryan race originated with the Greeks.

<p>
Later on in the prologue, the collapsing of time and space is rendered imagistically when the Olympic torch is passed from runner to runner, its path traced on a schematic map of Europe by way of the camera, which finally descends through clouds to alight in Hitler's Olympic Stadium.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In moving from the Parthenon to the Olympic stadium in Berlin, Riefenstahl's film enacts an ellipsis that transports the spectator into a temporality it represents as mythological rather than historical. Thus Riefenstahl's prologue closely illustrates Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's elaboration of "the Nazi myth" as promoting a spatial and temporal bridge from ancient Greece&#x02014;via Winckelmann's eighteenth century&#x02014;to Nazi Germany ("TNM," 309).

<p>
Sculpture has an important role to play in the mythmaking program of the prologue: myth is a plastic fiction, a "fictioning" whose role is to propose types to be imitated, as Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy put it ("TNM," 297). After entering the Parthenon at the beginning of the prologue, the camera focuses on statues of Greek gods from multiple perspectives, its movement producing the illusion of their movement. The arrangement of the statues creates a striking depth of field, and the orchestration of the dissolves contributes to the illusion that the statues themselves are animated, seeming to move around freely as the camera tracks around the res. Enhanced by the liberal use of vaseline and smoke, the impression of movement in this sequence is nonetheless an allusion to Pygmalion, whose sculpture of the beautiful Galatea Venus brought to life.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  While filming against a dark background with a strong key light highlighting faces, Zielke created an auratic glow by means of softer and more dispersed light emanating from behind the sculptural res. Giving the impression of candlelight, this flickering lends a suggestion of motion to the statuary, calling to mind a late eighteenth-century proto-cinematic practice: the fashion for nocturnal visits to sculpture galleries that allowed spectators to enjoy the impression of "living sculptures," on whom candlelight conferred an uncanny sensation of movement.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  By this 


<b></b>


means, too, Riefenstahl's prologue situates itself within a spectrum of received artistic tradition: it is precisely by participating in the Greek production of myth as art that Riefenstahl mimetically allies her work with Greek tradition. Here the (film) art that rehearses myth's embodiment as sculpture clearly functions as a means of identification.

<p>
The staged re-birth of myth and perfect beauty continues as a series of shots of the perfect male form&#x02014;a statue of Apollo&#x02014;is interspersed with shots of Aphrodite, the perfect female form. Images overlap and fade quickly as the two appear to move across the screen towards one another, soon to be replaced by a life-size sculpture of Discobulus, the ideal <i>human</i> form as athlete, metaphorically rendered as the offspring of the gods. But the apotheosis of Riefenstahl's regenerative strategies occurs as, with a nearly perfect match on the dissolve, a human athlete in an identical posture and against a natural setting takes its place.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Here art produces life: having enlivened the stasis of sculpture by means of its own motion, the camera now records the movements of a living human re superimposed upon the statue. As the static sculpture is released from the <i>tableau</i>, exploding into life and movement, it is suggested that the mythical past has come alive as well. By formal means, then, the prologue suggests the German claim that the experience of Greek art is that of the <i>Formwillen</i>, the will to form, and claims Rosenberg's goal of "an organic art that produces life" as the guiding principle of Riefenstahl's work ("TNM," 309).

<p>
In her memoirs, Riefenstahl represents her experience of the visual arts and dance as continuous with one another, and both are continuous with film in her artistic practice.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Indeed, the next sequence that concerns us here&#x02014;re studies of male athletes&#x02014;derives from a series of paintings of nude athletes by the American painter Stowitts, paintings much admired by Riefenstahl, who had hoped to incorporate them directly into the prologue by means of filters and out-of-focus effects.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  While these paintings themselves did not find their way into the film, their look influenced the rendering of live male athletes throwing javelins and shot-put, res characteristically shot from below. In the next sequence&#x02014;the dance sequence&#x02014;dance is not simply the female counterpart to male athleticism, but continues the meditation on movement and stasis begun earlier by the juxtaposition of camera movement with sculpture. Their arms swaying rhythmically, the women's movements are mythologically-inflected as well as "organic," in unison with the rhythms of nature, the rolling waves and the swaying grasses. This, too, is body art: at one and the same time their ornamentally-arranged bodies allude to the many-armed Aryan god Shiva and to similar patterns formed by the Tiller Girls. Once again Riefenstahl conflates pre-modern and modern references. 

<p>
Choreographed by Riefenstahl herself, the women's dances harken back to her acting debut as Diotima in Fanck's <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, where her performance is likewise cut with waves breaking on the shore.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Yet this sequence may also have been inspired by Stowitts, who was himself a dancer in the mode of Isadora Duncan (<i>LRAO</i>, 136). In this sequence, the women's dances are in the expressive style promoted by Duncan, who often performed in Greek chitons and claimed to have been schooled by "wind and wave and winged flight of bird and bee."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Since Duncan echoed her time 


<b></b>


in believing that the harmony of body and soul produce movement as the soul's "natural language," her views were compatible with the dominant German understanding of Greek antiquity as well as with Riefenstahl's ideas of dance.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Although its erotic element is not wholly repressed, dance in <i>Olympia</i>'s prologue is a far cry from its origins in dionysian rites as envisioned by Nietzsche&#x02014;yet here, too, it is connected with the natural, the communal, and religious. 

<p>
But Riefenstahl's choreography does not harken back to Isadora Duncan alone: it is synthetic, incorporating Duncan's style, yet even more indebted to that of Mary Wigman, Riefensthal's erstwhile teacher. Wigman for her part had for years been a student of Rudolf von Laban at Monte Verita in Ascona, Switzerland, where she and others performed ritualistic dances naked&#x02014;in harmony with nature&#x02014;at sunrise and sunset. It was also at Ascona that Wigman developed the ecstatic, dionysian rhythms that forged her Witch Dance (<i>Hexentanz</i>), said to have been the origin of modern dance as we know it. Further, as Riefenstahl suggests in her memoirs, Wigman's dance performances were also influenced by rhythmical gymnastics, a form of exercise closely linked to the art of sculpture&#x02014;and promoted by the Nazis.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Indeed, both Laban and Wigman had roles to play in the dance performances originally planned around the Olympics themselves. Laban as head of Goebbel's organization for German dance performance (the <i>Tanzb&#x000FC;hne</i>, or dance stage) was to orchestrate the planned Dance Olympics (<i>Tanz Olympiade</i>), in which Wigman and her troupe were to perform. Quite appropriately, one might say, Laban choreographed the planned program around themes from Nietzsche's texts, including <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  After watching the performance, however, Goebbels cancelled the program: denounced as "hostile to the state," perhaps its ideology was too explicit.

<p>
Interestingly, the dancers who performed in Riefenstahl's prologue were chosen by Willy Zielke from among students at the Laban and Wigman schools of dance in Berlin.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Read as originating in sculpture, as moving sculpture, or as a series of sculptures, dance in Riefenstahl's prologue has a relation to rhythmical gymnastics <i>(rhythmische Gymnastik</i>) that must have derived from Wigman. A form of open-air exercise much promoted in Germany during this period, rhythmical gymnastics involved the creation of dance-like exercise movements in which participants modeled their poses on Greek statuary. Originally progressive in spirit, rhythmical gymnastics was promoted during the Nazi period as an aspect of body culture (<i>K&#x000F6;rperkultur</i>): the implications of <i>K&#x000F6;rperkultur</i> and naturism for the pursuit of racial hygiene need no documentation here.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Suffice it to say that ideology of rhythmical gymnastics is consonant with that of the "Strength through Joy" (<i>Kraft durch Freude</i>)  movement, and with the Nazi emphasis on physical strength and health more generally.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 

<p>
Imitating sculptural poses is seen as an act of mimetic identification that promotes the beautiful spirit and body's espoused by the neoclassical tradition. Mimetic identification is effected through the body's pose, by means of which it physically enacts myth as embodied in sculpture.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Transitional dance movements link these poses, producing a rhythm of movement and stasis. In miming sculptural poses, the body is at once aestheticized and trained, subjected to a "theory of dressage" that also has its 


<b></b>


origins in the eighteenth century.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Sculpture is brought to life and the living body rendered periodically immobile. Not surprisingly, given the late eighteenth century's interest in proto-cinematic spectacles, another artistic practice of this period serves as a model for rhythmical gymnastics. These are Emma Hart's <i>tableau</i> performances of classical statues and res from mythology, with their erratic rhythm of bursts of motion contrasted with moments of prolonged stillness. Witnessed by Goethe during his stay in Naples, Hart's performances are described in his memoirs and no doubt served to inspire the famous <i>tableaux vivants</i> in <i>Elective Affinities</i>.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Absent from Hart's <i>tableaux</i>, of course, is the discourse of physical self-improvement: her performances are perceived as theatrical spectacles whose impact was to be spiritual&#x02014;although there is little doubt that Hart's performances also produced a pornographic effect upon her audiences.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Both Hart's "living pictures" and rhythmical gymnastics resemble the children's game of "statues" that requires the moving player suddenly to "freeze" and hold her pose. Rhythmical gymnastics,too, rehearses the choreography of stasis and movement even as it recalls <i>tableau vivant</i> and the staged <i>tableau</i>. The flow of temporality that is motion is arrested and held in the static pose, only to be released again into temporality. In this alternation it, too, serves as a model for Riefenstahl's filmic choreography.

<p>
Of course dance itself suggests the complementary nature of movement and stasis; it defines motion as emerging from and returning to the "stillness of an ideal pose."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Alternatively, we might say that the dionysian aspect of dance&#x02014;its expressive movement&#x02014;is tempered in dance by the poses that derive from apollonian&#x02014;sculptural&#x02014;form. For Nietzsche, famously, Wagnerian musical theater represents the ideal artistic compromise between the dionysian and apollonian principles. Similarly, perhaps, <i>tableau</i> moments within the flux of filmic images&#x02014;the "ceaseless motion" mentioned by Sontag and by Kracauer before her&#x02014;may be their particular form of compromise in Riefenstahl's filmmaking. Understood as a programmed series of images&#x02014;hence both spatial and temporal&#x02014;the body art that is dance has marked similarities to the series of images that is film. At one level, Riefenstahl's fascist, filmic choreography as read by Sontag expresses the struggle between erotic energy and formal control expressed by way of the body in dance.

3. Tableau and Photograph
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
"Photography is a kind of primitive theater, a kind of <i>Tableau Vivant</i>," Roland Barthes writes in <i>Camera Lucida</i>, "a ration of the motionless and made-up face beneath which we see the dead."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Here is another form of visual representation to be placed alongside the <i>tableau</i> moment. The many collections of photographs published by Riefenstahl confirm the view that the photograph relates to an interest in posed bodies and stasis in her work more generally:<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  as we recall, Sontag's "Fascinating Fascism" begins as a review of <i>Land of the Nuba</i>. Decorated with scars and with ceremonial paint, the beautiful bodies of the Sudanese Nuba are perfect subjects not only for Riefenstahl's photographic aesthetic, but for photography per se as read by Barthes. 


<b></b>


"She interprets the Nuba as a mystical people with an extraordinarily developed artistic sense. . . . she insists that their principal activity is ceremonial," writes Sontag ("FF," 38). At the center of their ceremonial and artistic activity is death, thus doubly rendering the Nuba photography's ideal subjects. Of course Barthes is not the first theorist of photography to link photography with death.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  What is distinctive in Barthes's formulation, however, is the link with death through theater, through the <i>cult</i> of the dead. "To make oneself up," Barthes writes, "is to designate oneself as a body simultaneously living and dead: the whitened bust of the totemic theater, the man with the painted face in Chinese theater, the rice-paste makeup of the Indian Katha-Kali, the Japanese No mask."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Barthes, waxing anthropological here, might well have expanded his catalogue to include the Sudanese Nuba who, for purposes of ceremony, paint their bodies with a grayish-white ash, a substance that "unmistakably suggests death" ("FF," 38).

<p>
This is not the place to re-examine the centrality and nauseating glamorization of death in fascist ideology, or its connection with pornography and kitsch so compellingly sketched out by Friedlander.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  We will not linger over the ideology that Riefensthal brings to her photographic work on the Nuba, her interest in their funeral rites as a "ballet of ghosts," or her easy acceptance of the trope of the "noble savage," determined by a specifically German form of primitivism that has been variously linked to fascism.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Our subject continues to be the significance of <i>tableau</i> moments in Riefenstahl's artistic practice, and we take up here its specifically photographic element, suggesting that we must also read the <i>tableau</i> moment in Riefenstahl's work in light of a tendency to play off a specifically photographic arrestation against film's flow of images. Elsaesser has made the connection between "a certain photographic aesthetic" in Riefenstahl's work and the film practices of Arnold Fanck, the director who enabled Riefenstahl's career as filmmaker ("LR," 190). If Fanck, as Elsaesser puts it, was "essentially a still photographer . . . primarily interested in the tonalities of the photographic print," can we not also, Elsaesser asks, read the failures as well as the success of <i>Triumph of the Will</i> as deriving from "a box of photographers tricks"? ("LR," 190) In lieu of such tricks, we will examine the staging of the photographic in <i>The Blue Light</i>, first released in 1932.

<p>
In this film&#x02014;Riefenstahl's first feature film as a director&#x02014;a few instances of the arrested and aestheticized human body are of particular interest. The first of these is a sculptural group, a monument representing young men lured to their deaths by Junta, the Riefenstahl character, and a mystical blue light. In the context of the film's romanticizing narrative and by virtue of its auratic lighting, this sculptural group has the uncanny look not of a monument, but of bodies themselves, mummified, perhaps, or otherwise preserved. In keeping with the film's suggestion that the men are martyrs, this monument has the look of a religious icon.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Further, these sculptural res bear a marked resemblance to the tableau of Mexican mummies with which&#x02014;years later&#x02014;<i>Nosferatu</i> , Werner Herzog's "symphony of death" will open. As in the case of the actual mummies in Herzog's film, the sculptural bodies of <i>The Blue Light</i> appear to be "real" bodies (of actors) taken up into representation. This is not a freeze frame, 


<b></b>


not actually a photograph&#x02014;but the uncanny "real" yet arrested quality of the bodies in this sculpture, their <i>tableau vivant</i> quality, calls to mind Bazin's insight concerning the photograph's ability to embalm time. It suggests as well as Bazin's insistence on its indexical quality, on the manner in which, in registering the body imprint, the photograph records something of its materiality.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  The arrested bodies of the monument suggest an interrogation of the photograph. 

<p>
These frozen bodies are visually continuous with the static poses and immobile expressions of the villagers in this film, repeatedly shot as <i>tableaux</i>, especially of heads arranged frieze-like and in close-up that foreshadow similar conrations in <i>Triumph of the Will</i>. In these arrangements, bodies are doubly aestheticized, at once sculptural and photographic, held up to the scrutiny of a meditative camera.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Such images exist in striking contrast to the nimbleness of Junta's movements: her sinuous motion from cliff to peak is expressive of the natural eroticism that has lead the young men to their deaths&#x02014;for if they are martyrs, it can only be to their libidinal drives. In pitting expressive dynamism against formal containments and stasis, Riefenstahl pits eros against thanatos even in this early film.

<p>
We turn now to our final object of scrutiny, to the actual photograph of Junta which frames <i>The Blue Light</i>. Throughout the film's narrative, the painter Vigo's struggle to arrest the mobile image of Junta on his canvas has also been the film's struggle. In the final shot of the narrative&#x02014;those of the version still available to us, without the frame story&#x02014;Junta is found by Vigo as she lies dead amidst flowers. Death, especially female death, is predictably aestheticized, predictably floral&#x02014;recall the dead Ophelia&#x02014;and Junta's face is surrounded by an auratic halo of light that alludes to Pre-Raphaelite portraits. Found first by eye of the painter Vigo, Junta is only then discovered by the film camera that frames her face: the filmic image is held, becomes a still&#x02014;and is finally revealed to the film's spectator as a framed photograph. Located first in the eye of the painter, in other words, Junta's image is appropriated by the film camera, then passed along to the medium to which, in death, it properly belongs: photography. Underscoring its photographic basis, the film's narrative ends in the image that has motivated it from the start. 

<p>
Of course Junta has occupied the space of representation from the film's beginning: as a creature with a dancer's agility, Junta is linked as firmly to the rhythms of the natural world as is Diotima in <i>The Holy Mountain</i>. Notably, Fanck's 1926 film, which appeared five years before <i>The Blue Light</i>, opens with a shot of Diotima's inanimate face in extreme close-up. "Her eyes are shut," writes Eric Rentschler, "we seem to be looking at a death mask."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Soon this photographic shot of Diotima's face will be animated, enveloped by the film's movement, and incorporated into its narrative.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  These complementary instances&#x02014;the photograph in <i>The Blue Light</i>; the photographic "death mask" of <i>The Holy Mountain&#x02014;</i>both bracket narrative in their respective films, suggesting an approach to film that insists on its photographic origin.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup> 

<p>
Although a <i>tableau</i> moment in film is itself bracketed by the succession of images that precedes and follows it, its essential stasis and "out-of-time" feel suggest an affinity between <i>tableau vivant</i> and the photograph. As in the case of the still photograph 


<b></b>


when it occurs in film, <i>tableau vivant</i> introduces a pause into the film's narrative. Here time is converted into space and the temporal flow of images takes on the aspect of a spatial object. We are reminded of Bellour's contention in "The Film Stilled" that those photographic instants that "suspend the time of movement and open it up" seem to introduce "a kind of paralysis&#x02014;comparable to one that strikes painting into film."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  With Bellour, then, we can agree that <i>tableau vivant</i> also "makes cinema lean in the direction of photography, towards its power to inscribe death."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup> 

<p>
By way of conclusion, let us make a brief detour to an earlier moment in the history of photography&#x02014;to staged photography in the England of the 1850s and 1960s, which rekindled an interest in <i>tableau vivant</i> among the English bourgeoisie. During this period, there is a fashion especially for staged photographs of dead women, such as Henry Peach Robinson's rendering of "The Lady of Shalott."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  For the spectators of staged photographic images, their <i>frisson</i> seems to have consisted precisely in the juxtaposition of the living actress with the dead character she plays, now rendered doubly "dead" via the photographic medium. Of course the dead woman is in any case a Pre-Raphaelite subject: Elizabeth Sidall, for instance, was often painted as dead or dying by her husband Rossetti and his fellow artists.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  There is something necrophilic in this interest, of course&#x02014;it has been claimed that Rossetti was "obsessed with the relation of art to necrophilia."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  But Riefenstahl goes farther. In <i>The Blue Light</i>, Riefenstahl's Junta is herself martyred and rendered icon, becoming in the process masochism's ideal re. In the masochistic regime, as we recall, the erotic object is immobilized and identified with a "statue, a painting, a photograph."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In its extreme form, the object becomes indistinguishable from the representation. Now, perhaps, we are in a position to suggest how the psychosexual dynamic of fascist art&#x02014;its masochistic choreography of movement and stasis&#x02014;is imbricated in the several mediums within which we have situated Riefenstahl's work. For in Riefenstahl's aesthetic, I would suggest, a libidinal charge is actually transferred from the erotic object to the statue, painting, or photograph&#x02014;in other words, to art itself. "Art," therefore&#x02014;which has more than once motivated Riefenstahl's denial, served as her excuse&#x02014;art itself becomes the object of an all-consuming, erotically-charged fixation. Whereas Winckelmann's poetic prose lets slip just how much he is moved by male beauty&#x02014;sculpture becomes warm flesh&#x02014;in the case of Riefenstahl we find precisely the opposite movement: aesthetic pleasure is generated by those forms of art into which the body has been absorbed&#x02014;and rendered corpse.

<i>Laoco&#x000F6;n, or the Boundaries Between Poetry and Painting</i>, G. E. Lessing's seminal mid-18th century aesthetic treatise distinguishing the visual from the verbal arts, uses a Greek sculptural group representing the priest Laokoon and his sons as well as the dramatic narrative in the <i>Aeneid</i> in which it originates as the points of departure for a disquisition on the boundaries between poetry and painting. Like Lessing, Berman privileges writing temporal dimension and its concomitant ability to render narrative and history (both are <i>Geschichte</i> in German), while the visual&#x02014;often tied to bodies in these readings&#x02014;is merely imbued with a non-linguistic expressive force. Also like Lessing, Berman is opposed to the generic boundary crossings that descriptive poetry (Lessing) or ekphrasis (Berman) entail.

It was Riefenstahl's dancing that won her this role. Riefensthal studied at the Jutta Klamt School for expressive dance as well as with Eugenie Eduardova and Mary Wigman. In 1923, at the age of twenty-one, she performed publicly in Berlin, Munich, and other cities until a knee injury terminated her short career in May 1924. See Rainer Rother, <i>Leni Riefenstahl: The Seduction of Genius</i>, transl. Martin H. Bott (London: Continuum, 2002), 13-22, for an account of her career as a dancer. Reviews of Riefensthal performances during her brief career tend to read her dances as derivative, but praise her body for its beautiful form, sometimes read in explicitly sculptural terms. As one writer puts it, her body seemed to be "chiselled from marble, perfectly proportioned, beautifully groomed and evenly honed." <i>Z&#x000FC;richer Post</i> (22 February 1924); quoted from Rother, <i>Leni Riefenstahl</i>, 20.

<i>The Blue Light</i>  and the much-disputed <i>Tiefland</i> (1940/54), likewise juxtapose fluidity of movement with static poses. In this regard, <i>The Blue Light</i> has much in common with <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, since it also features Riefenstahl lithe movements and poses against natural scenes. Similarly, her dance in <i>Tiefland</i>, set in Spain, draws on the erotic rhythm of movement and its abrupt cessation that characterizes flamenco.

Pierre de Coupertin revived the Olympic games at the end of the nineteenth century in a humanistic intellectual climate that believed in the importance of the parallel development of the mind and the body, the importance of physical exercise.

Since my aim is primarily to contextualize and examine interarts questions in Riefenstahl work, I will not focus on the entire prologue, although its interest is evident. Following the sequences of single male athlete and women dancers in groups, the torch bearer sequence is significant for any ideological analysis. First filmed in slow motion&#x02014;effecting a temporal ellision&#x02014;the torchbearer runs through ruins, then through a scene with intact buildings, a reconstructed world. The torch is shown to travel first through time and then through space, its route traced on a map until finally torch&#x02014;and tradition&#x02014;descending like Hitler through the clouds, arrive at Hitler's Olympic Stadium in Berlin, in Nazi Germany.

As Graham tells us, Stowitts was particularly interested in the male physique, and painted a series of nudes res of UCLA and USC althletes which he called "The American Champions." These homo-erotic portraits shocked the American art commitee and they refused to include them in the American art exhibition in Berlin, causing Stowitts to exhibit them in Berlin at his own expense. Apparently the paintings were well-received by critics, but since the portraits included some of Black and Jewish athletes, Alfred Rosenberg closed the show (<i>LRAO</i>, 136-7).

The camera's intense physiognomic interest in the faces of the villagers in this film no doubt derives from Riefenstahl's collaboration with B&#x000E9;la Bal&#x000E1;zs, who wrote the screenplay for <i>The Blue Light</i>. For Bal&#x000E1;zs, the significance of the photographic apparatus resides in its ability to reveal the expressive power particularly of the human face and of objects. As Bal&#x000E1;zs puts it, "the mute soliloquy of the face speaks": meaning, in other words&#x02014;to recur to Berman's phrase&#x02014;is "written right across their faces." It is the close-up, according to Bal&#x000E1;zs, that allows us to "see to the bottom of the soul by means of . . . tiny movements of facial muscles." While at some remove from Benjamin's optical 


<b></b>


unconscious, Bal&#x000E1;zs's interest in the photographic dimension of film is likewise optical, lodged in the revelatory capacity of the camera. While it contradicted his leftist political leanings, Bal&#x000E1;zs's belief in optically-rendered expressiveness was easily assimilable to a fascist concern with physiognomy and racial typology.

The framed photograph of Junta is not the final image of <i>The Blue Light</i>, of course, that is the image of writing, the ornamental typeface of the book that tells her story.

In need of money, the 23-year old Jean Rhys posed nude for a British artist, probably William Orpen, in 1913.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Similarly strapped for cash in 1923, Claude McKay, then in his early thirties and living in Paris, posed nude in the art school of the Cubist painter Andre Lhote.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  A white woman from an elite Dominican family and future European modernist, Rhys occupied a very different colonial subjectivity to Claude McKay, who was the son of a successful black peasant proprietor in Jamaica and in 1923 already a prominent poet. Yet both Caribbean writers responded to the experience of posing nude by writing and rewriting the experience in a way that challenged modernist aesthetics, exposing the ostensibly radical modernist primitivism which was deeply implicated in Europe's colonial and national projects. Further, both Rhys and McKay expressed their critique of modernism and nationalism by exposing the racialized sexual politics of modernist aesthetics. I take advantage of this apparent coincidence in the biography and work of Rhys and McKay to illustrate that their similarly transgressive representation of sexuality challenged the modernist movements in which they participated as well as the then emerging national literatures in the anglophone Caribbean. 

<p>
In the first three decades of the twentieth century, anglophone Caribbean writers established national literatures as part of the development of cultural and political nationalism in the region. As the work of Rhys and McKay illustrates, during the same period, Caribbean writers made significant contributions to European modernism and to the Harlem Renaissance. Because most writers had extensive experience abroad and engaged with 


<b></b>


Caribbean, European, and U.S. culture in their work, anglophone Caribbean literature of this period was international. It provides a window into the process by which Caribbeans integrated Western modernism and modernity into the Caribbean and the Caribbean into European and U.S. literary movements. Not all writers, however, were equally nationalist. Some, like the Jamaican poet and playwright Una Marson, sought to establish national literatures in the Caribbean and, at the same time, saw their work as contributing to the emerging political nationalism in the region. In contrast, McKay (as an ambivalent participant in the Harlem Renaissance and strong proponent of international black aesthetics) took a critical stance towards European and African American nationalisms. Similarly Rhys rejected European nationalism and had little or no contact with national literary or political movements in the Caribbean.

<p>
All writers of this period, however, privileged Caribbean folk culture and sexuality, and thus, made the daily lives and cultural practices of colonized Afro-Caribbean working class people the subject of bourgeois literary and national culture. In establishing black folk culture and sexuality as the center of Caribbean literature, Caribbean artists confronted the phenomenon that modern European aesthetics oddly mirrored their literary projects. Sexuality and black culture held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein. Yet, as Simon Gikandi persuasively argues, Picasso (and presumably many of his colleagues) incorporated elements of African cultures into modernism by divorcing African bodies and culture from individuality, modernity, and the "brutality of late colonialism."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  While Caribbean writers saw black folk culture as the basis of a modern national culture and identity, the linked European projects of modernism and imperialism construed black folk culture and sexuality as evidence of colonized people's uncontrolled sexuality and incapacity to rule themselves. 

<p>
As has been noted by many critics, the fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism. Rhys and McKay worked with Orpen and Lhote respectively; they refer to Amedeo Modigliani, Ludwig Kirchner, and Jules Pascin explicitly in their work.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  With the exception of Orpen, these writers had adeep interest in African and other "primitive" cultures and are representative of the larger movement of European modernist and avant-garde aesthetics in their extensive deployment of African and other "non-western" art.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  As Sieglinde Lemke asserts, Picasso (and his peers) built modernist aesthetics by "mocking philistine notions of decency <b> . . . </b> allying himself with what the bourgeois ethos considered taboo&#x02014;prostitutes and African masks."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In "Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon," Picasso famously transformed a painting of prostitutes in Avignon by fashioning their faces and bodies in shapes and angles inspired by African art. He thus merged French prostitutes with his conception of primitive African art.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Pascin's 1924 "Temple of Beauty" similarly and explicitly illustrates how colonial constructions of gender, sexuality, and race were reiterated in modernist art (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). At the center of a chaotic canvas of naked women, a large and nearly nude black woman directs her enormous buttocks at the spectator. This pose in particular replicated and perhaps parodied nineteenth-century portrayals of the "Hottentot Venus" which emphasized


<b></b>


the enormity of the Venus's buttocks and typically directed them at the observer. Sander Gilman has argued that these representations articulated the European fantasy that black women's buttocksliterally embodied their racial licentiousness and difference.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  "The Temple of Beauty" similarly illustrates the convergence of representations of the prostitute and the primitive, of black and female sexuality in early twentieth century art. Sander Gilman associates these artistic representations of black women's sexuality with Freudian and other scientific discourses, which defined female genitalia as more primitive than male genitalia or saw African sexual practices as a form of prostitution ("HP," 91, 99). As models, white women, people of color, and non-western artefactsthus inhabited the same or similar imaginative and physical spaces.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

Growing up in Caribbean colonies McKay and Rhys both experienced the extreme distance colonial society placed between the white planter's daughter and the black peasant&#x02014;a distance of class clothed in terms of a discourse of respectability&#x02014;marriage, gender roles, etiquette, and education. While in Europe, however, Rhys and McKay were confronted with the merging of black male and white female identities. As models, McKay became metaphorically sexualized and female, while Rhys became sexualized and black. As models they lost their particular identities and modernity and became complicit in modernist projects that expressed the colonial ideology they sought 


<b></b>


to challenge. The association of the nude model with prostitution and female sexuality contradicted McKay's goal of creating a strong, masculine black and modernist aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Similarly, European modernists' merger of blackness, sexuality, and white femininity stood in opposition to Rhys's aesthetic project of delineating the similarities and differences between categories of race, sexuality, class, and gender.

<p>
Gikandi begins a recent essay with an anecdote that suggests that European modernism subsumed the Caribbean into its conception of Africa. When the Guyanese artist, Aubrey Williams, met Picasso, Picasso expressed his desire to paint Williams's "very fine African head."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This desire at once denied Williams the identity of modern artist and subsumed him into the category of things African and therefore primitive. Rhys indicates that English discourse generally elided differences between the Caribbean and Africa. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, English chorus girls call Rhys's white creole heroine a "hottentot" because she "was born in a hot place . . . in the West Indies or somewhere . . . "<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  When they posed nude, Rhys and McKay found themselves in positions parallel to Williams's. They had stepped into the shoes of Picasso's prostitutes and primitives and become both sexualized and Africanized. 

<p>
Rhys and McKay transformed these alienating elements of modernist aesthetics by writing and rewriting the scene of posing nude. McKay includes his experience of posing in his memoir <i>A Long Way from Home</i>  and his novel <i>Banjo</i> ; Rhys makes posing and modern art critical to her heroine's identity in "Triple Sec" (1924?), <i>Quartet</i> , <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i> , and <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> . In the course of representing this scene, they asserted the modernity and humanity of models and colonized people and the artifice of Europe's conception of the primitive. To create Caribbean modernism, their work thus redefined the central res and dynamics of European modernist aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In rewriting the scene of posing, Rhys and McKay represent a conventional tableau in early twentieth century European painting, the self portrait with model&#x02014;examples include Orpen's 1911 "The Model" and Leo Kirchner's "Artist with Model." They thus confronted the terms and power dynamics of modernist representation through their redefinition of a genre of painting that self-consciously represented the power dynamics of representation itself.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

Although McKay only briefly mentions posing in his autobiography <i>A Long Way from Home</i> , the text critiques European avant-garde andmodernist artists by illustrating that they participated in the European colonialism and bourgeois respectability many of them sought to critique.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Pascin serves as McKay's introduction to the modernists' world of brothels. McKay describes meeting Pascin in Paris and receiving a letter of introduction to a man McKay tellingly names "Le Corse," a brothel owner in Marseilles who shows artists around the red light district and provides them protection. Artists paid tribute to Le Corse by painting his portrait, and Pascin gave him sketches and paintings.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  From the profits of prostitution, Le Corse raised his family in respectability. He proudly told McKay that he didn't "allow [his] daughters to powder

and smoke. I am bringing them up in the right way. They go to a convent school. My son goes to a commercial college. We keep our family clear and clean of our business." (<i>LWH</i>, 285) Prostitution provided the capital for respectable women to attend convent school and make respectable marriages while modernist artists depended on this hypocritical and age-old system, in order to produce modernist art that claimed to radically challenge European conceptions of respectability and to constitute a modern aesthetic. McKay expresses the significance of this encounter with Le Corse by suggesting that it inspired him to write <i>Banjo</i>.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> embodied and theorized McKay's new black and masculine modern primitivism. A history of modernity from the perspective of the international black (male) proletariat, <i>Banjo</i> links an explicit critique of European modernist aesthetics with a critique of European and U.S. modernity. Through the experiences of black working men in Marseilles, the novel records the consolidation of European capitalism and nationalism and the rise of U.S. imperialism in the aftermath of World War I. Nearly all the women are prostitutes, most of them French but many from the empire. This is a "romance of the race"&#x02014;a genre McKay constructs in opposition to a national romance in which a heterosexual union would serve as allegory for national unity. <i>Banjo</i>'s protagonists are not a heterosexual couple, but Ray, the Haitian intellectual of <i>Home to Harlem</i> and Banjo, an African American working class musician. They are the leaders of a community of black men from Africa, the U.S., and the Caribbean, sailors who have jumped ship just after WWI and resist the capitalist system by rejecting work and sharing their income from panhandling, music, and women. The internationalism of the group is an explicit rejection of nationhood&#x02014;Banjo, for instance, arrives in Marseilles by renouncing his U.S. passport and asking to be deported. The romance ends not in a marriage symbolic of national unity but with the pairing of two strong men, Ray and Banjo, setting off together to vagabond through Europe. Their homosocial and homoerotic partnership symbolizes the need for a black international solidarity.

<p>
The scene of his hero, Ray, posing nude, plays a central part in establishing the diasporic cultural and social unity at the heart of McKay's project. Ray orchestrates a night of storytelling surrounded by black men from Africa, the Caribbean, and the U.S. at the Caf&#x000E9; African, "a big caf&#x000E9;, the first that any Negro in the town ever owned." At first the Senegalese fear that Ray will represent them as primitive and inferior to African Americans, but once Ray tells an "African folk tale" from Haiti, "nearly all the Senegalese wanted to tell a native story" and the national divisions between the men diffuse.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Ray is the only one to tell two stories&#x02014;the second of his stories is the tale of posing nude in a Paris art school. 

<p>
In telling his story of posing nude, Ray radically redefines the European conception of the primitive as a feminine, uncontrolled child in need of European domination. When the art students, who are white U.S. women, ask Ray his opinion of African art, he responds that African sculpture is defined by "the feeling of perfect self-mastery and quiet self-assurance."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The students, however, act out the colonial desire to dominate the primitive by measuring Ray's body while the teacher, also a white woman, has Ray perform a Western fantasy of black male hypersexuality. He "pose[d] in a very 


<b></b>


interesting tableau&#x02014;standing naked on a little platform with a stout long staff in my hand and a pretty Parisienne in the nude crouched at the base" (<i>B</i>, 129). The "stout long staff," an external prop, magnifies the sexual significance his black body already signals. The naked white woman at its base mocks the myth that black men rape white women, by suggesting that white women worship black male sexuality. In making a "nordic" woman invent this pose for Ray, McKay reveals that these primitivist ideas of black male sexuality are the invention of white and European culture.

<p>
Ray disrupts this modernist project and rescues black masculinity from its feminization by asserting his sexual power. At one modeling session, Ray muses on the sensuality of the Harlem cabaret, "Sheba Palace," and becomes "savage." Finding "refuge" in dropping his stick, he exclaims the conclusion of his story: "<i>only the other sex was qualified for posing in the nude</i>" (<i>B</i>, 130 my emphasis). We assume that Ray has had an erection that literally disrupts the American and European modernist project. His final exclamation that "only the other sex was qualified for posing nude," indicates that in saving black men from the exoticizing primitivism of modernism, he has relinquished to that primitivism all women, including black women. Ray's emphasis on gender division reflects the view of both McKay's protagonists elsewhere in the novel. Banjo "took all women as one" (<i>B</i>, 170) and excludes Latnah, the novel's one admirable woman, from accompanying him and Ray at the end of the novel; Ray asserts, "woman is woman all over the world, no matter what her color is" (<i>B</i>, 206). McKay's novel, like his protagonists, imagines a world divided into gendered communities and alliances that overshadow its many images of black international unity.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 

<p>
For McKay, the modernist primitive is located not in statues or Paris studios, but in Banjo's black proletarian orchestra. Playing at the "biggest night" at the Caf&#x000E9; African, the orchestra "brought all the joy-lovers of darkest color together to shake that thing." Here a black proletariat produces and consumes its own modernist primitivism, sidestepping the hierarchy and alienation McKay and Rhys experienced in modernist studios. As in his description of posing, McKay reappropriates the primitive by redefining its sexuality as powerful and masculine. The narrator comments that "Negroes are never so beautiful and magical as when they do that gorgeous sublimation of the primitive African sex feeling" (<i>B</i>, 105). This "gorgeous sublimation" is strongest when men dance "male with male or individually, [rather] than with the girls" (<i>B</i>, 48). In fact, in an "exquisite movement," two men, "a coffee-black boy from Cameroon and a chocolate-brown from Dakar stand up to each other to dance a native sex-symbol dance" (<i>B</i>, 50). McKay views the U.S. as the most modern country and "the sharp, noisy notes of the banjo belong to the American Negro's loud music of life&#x02014;an affirmation of his hardy existence in the midst of <i>the biggest, the most tumultuous civilization in modern life</i>" (<i>B</i>, 49, my emphasis). McKay explicitly marks Banjo's "orchestry" as modern by making the U.S. "banjo dominat[e] the other instruments" (<i>B</i>, 49). Defined by its maleness, its homoeroticism, its internationalism and modernity, Banjo's "orchestry" illustrates how McKay's conception of the primitive counters the modernist primitivism of European artists which feminized and sexualized the primitive and made it part of a distant geography and ahistorical time.


<b></b>


<p>
The modernist primitivism McKay proposes in Banjo's orchestra is equally tailored to challenge the aesthetics of Du Bois and other Harlem intellectuals who insisted on propriety (and therefore heterosexuality) in African American art. In masculinizing the primitive, McKay also reclaims the primitive from the vastly successful Josephine Baker whose sexualized and female primitivism had taken France by storm in the years between McKay's career as a model in 1923 and his publication of <i>Banjo</i>in 1929. While Baker's primitivism earned her wealth and independence which McKay saw as signs of masculinity, McKay's own primitivist performance in modeling earned him little money and left him financially dependent, a condition his protagonist Ray describes as emasculating; it deprives him of the "free splendid spirit" he had in the U.S. as an "erect" "vagabond poet" (<i>B</i>,65). McKay's choice of words suggests the connection between (erect) male sexuality and manhood also expressed in Ray's rejection of the role of nude model.

<p>
McKay's new primitivism in <i>Banjo</i> critiques European modernity through the Chauffeur, a re based on "Le Corse." The chauffeur is a member of the proletariat who, like Le Corse, invests in prostitution in order to gain respectability. The Chauffeur uses profits from prostitutes who work for him (and sleep with him) to marry a respectable woman and to buy a home in the suburbs. He, however, "could <i>look down on the Ditch</i> [the district of prostitution] and all such places with the mean, evil, and cynical eyes of a respectable person" (<i>B</i>, 288, my emphasis). Ray presents the Chauffeur's hypocritical respectability as indicative of the larger hypocrisy of European respectability. The Chauffeur will, Ray tells Banjo, become "a respectable <i>p&#x000E8;re de famille</i>&#x02014;a good taxpayer and supporter of a<i>strong national government, with a firm colonial policy</i>" (<i>B</i>, 289, my emphasis). Ray connects the working class chauffeur to "the titled and ennobled and fashionable and snobbish gentry of this age [who] have the roots of their fortunes in the buying and selling of black bodies. And had he any reason to doubt that the landlords of Boody Lane and the Ditch as a whole were collecting that prostitute rent to live respectably and educate their children in decency?" (<i>B</i>, 288). Respectability is rotten at its core, Ray suggests, because it is handmaiden to Europe's colonialism ("the firm colonial policy") and racially exclusive, class-divided nationalism ("the strong national government" that "looks down on the ditch"). The ruling class, their lower class co-conspirators, modernist artists&#x02014;all depended on prostitution and colonialism, an international system of exploitation embedded in respectability.

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> embodies and articulates a primitivism marked by internationalism, proletarianism, and transgressive sexuality that distinguishes it not only from European modernisms, but also from most African American and Caribbean modernisms.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In McKay's modernist primitivism, as in that of Picasso and Pascin, black "primitive" culture and prostitutes are focal points. Yet whereas European modernists tended to merge black primitivism and prostitution in a colonial and heterosexual fantasy, McKay sets the primitive in an almost binary opposition to prostitution. The beach boys&#x02014;as members of an essentially male homosocial and socialist community&#x02014;stand in stark opposition to the prostitutes whose feminine world of materialism and inhumanity symbolize European capitalist modernity.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  McKay describes the black proletarian 


<b></b>


diaspora as a "primitive child, this kinky-headed, big-laughing black boy of the world" who refuses to become "the regimented creatures of civilization" and in so doing, "challenge[s] . . . civilization itself" (<i>B</i>, 314). Its no-nonsense culture, its virile homosociality and homoeroticism, its financial reciprocity defy and antagonize the united bourgeois forces of respectability, capitalism, nationalism, and colonialism. In McKay's words, "the composite voice of the Negro&#x02014;speech, song, and laughter" is the red flag to the bull of Europe's modernity. Black proletarian culture gains its power to resist from its ability to accurately name reality. In the language of the black proletariat, Ray asserts, "there were no dots and dashes . . .&#x02014;nothing that could not be frankly said . . . no actor or fact of life for which they could not find a simple passable word." From this language, Ray "gained . . . finer nuances of the necromancy of language and the wisdom that any word may be right and magical in its proper setting" (<i>B</i>, 321). The men exert their verbal power by renaming the city's districts and streets after sexual body parts and orifices in a "carnivalesque" act the Jamaican poet Louise Bennett might call "colonising in reverse." In their words, "Quartier Reserv&#x000E9;" becomes the ditch, La Rue de Bouterie Boody Lane, and the place Victor Gelu "'Bum Square'" (<i>B</i>, 9).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
Borrowing this technique of sexualizing Europe from the black proletariat, McKay employs the metaphor of Marseilles as the anus of Europe to subvert Europe's conception of itself and its modernity as masculine, active, heterosexual, and unadulterated. He describes Marseilles as "Europe's best back door, discharging and receiving its traffic to the orient and Africa" (<i>B</i>, 69) an image whose sexuality is reinforced by McKay's sensual description of the traffic in bodies and goods in and out of Marseilles. His porters are "picturesque proletarians from far waters whose names were warm with romance" (<i>B</i>, 67); their sweat mixes erotically with the smells of commodities. Exclaiming, "oh, the earthy mingled smells of the docks!" (<i>B</i>, 67), McKay lists a nearly endless catalogue of products, "dropping their stuff on the docks, reposing in the warm odor of their rich perfumes." (<i>B</i>, 67) The narrator then illustrates that the "Barrels, bags, boxes" embody the labor that produces them, the "sweat-dripping bodies of black men naked under the equatorial sun" and "brown men half-clothed . . . plucking for the Occident world its exotic nourishment of life, under the whip, under the terror." McKay concludes his description of the severity and brutality of colonial exploitation by proclaiming the exploited and violated proletarian men "full of the wonderful thing of life" (<i>B</i>, 67). Their indomitable sexuality sexualizes the trade in goods, rendering Marseilles as the recipient of their goods, ratively the passive partner in an act of anal penetration.

<p>
In defining Europe through the image of anal penetration, an act Leo Bersani and Joseph Boone see as fundamentally in opposition to the dominant construction of European subjectivity as male, white, straight, and inviolate, McKay goes beyond inverting Europe's sexual and racial hierarchies. In his analysis of T. E. Lawrence's <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> (a text published in 1926, just two years before <i>Banjo</i>, that explores same-sex desire and colonialism from a European perspective), Boone focuses on Lawrence's experience of rape as a loss of "the citadel of [his] integrity," "the only possession we are born into the world with&#x02014;our bodily integrity."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To explain Lawrence's response, Boone cites Bersani's assertion that

<p class="noIndent">
Thus, in defining Europe as an anus that is constantly being penetrated by sexualized black and Asian men, McKay defines Europe as its own scare image. For McKay, Europe's modernity, its presumed difference and superiority, is not exactly inverted so much as destroyed by a fundamental hybridity and movement between Europe, Asia, and Africa, between modernity and primitivism, between the sexual order of the north and the sexual freedom of the south&#x02014;between the north's heterosexuality and the south's homosexuality. 

<p>
McKay shifts the center of modernity from the northern cities of Paris, London, and Berlin, to Marseilles, which as a Mediterranean capital stands at the threshold between Europe and Africa. At least since the eighteenth century, northern Europeans have associated the Mediterranean with sexual licence. A tradition of literary and social texts has defined the Mediterranean as part of a "sotadic zone," a site of homosexuality. The Mediterranean has featured in a series of travel narratives and photographs that showcased erotic portrayals of young men in southern Italy, Greece, and North Africa ("VC," 92-3).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  In his work McKay inverts European narratives of colonial and sexual conquest, defining Europe, rather than its colonies, as the object of penetration. The penetration is itself redefined as an <i>anal</i> penetration or sodomy&#x02014;an image colonial America and Ireland used to protest their colonization by England.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Hence the significance of <i>Banjo</i>'s closing image&#x02014;Banjo and Ray, two manly men setting off to vagabond through Europe together, bring their sexuality north in order that European men may find themselves in the positions of sexual passivity that European modernity and modernism imposed on the men of Africa and its diaspora.

<p>
My argument hinges on what may appear to be a contradiction. McKay rejected the classification of homosexual for himself because of its association in dominant discourses with whiteness and effeminacy. Yet in many of his works, he asserts the legitimacy of same sex-desire (<i>GVHR</i>, 90-1, 103).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In <i>Banjo</i>, he presents the same-sex desire of individual characters as legitimate, condemns homophobic attacks on queer men, and makes male homoeroticism the foundation of his attack on Western modernity and modernism. Rather than a rejection of homosexuality, we see in McKay's novels a redefinition of black male queer identity that distances black men from the effeminacy associated with (white) homosexuality. The final image of Banjo and Ray setting off together as two strong men revises contemporary conceptions of homosexuality that required gendered partnerships between manly and feminine men. 

<p>
At the same time as McKay legitimates queer sexuality, however, he deploys practices and stereotypes associated with homosexuality as a means of condemning his ideological opponents. He uses anal penetration to attack Europe's sense of its superiority. He criticizes W. E. B. du Bois's call for a respectable black aesthetics by depicting


<b></b>


the character who articulates du Bois's uplift agenda as a weak and effeminate gay man&#x02014;a "goosey" flute boy (<i>B</i>, 88). This representation of uplift as emasculating is consistent with McKay's later assertion that "respectable Negro opinion and criticism are not ready for artistic or other iconoclasm in Negroes. Between them they would emasculate the colored literary aspirant."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 

<p>
<i>Banjo</i> thus presents conflicting images of queer sexuality. The cause of these contradictions most likely lies in McKay's investment in nationalist ideals of manhood as strong and independent, and his desire to distance black men from any association with weakness and femininity. Here I follow A. B. Christa Schwarz's persuasive argument that for McKay, the imperative to create a manly black aesthetics and community took priority over legitimizing black male same-sex desire (<i>GVHR</i>, 118). McKay's contradictory representation of gay men reveals that even as he critiques respectability and nationalism as embedded in an international system of colonial and capitalist exploitation, his conception of masculinity borrows heavily from those ideologies. His transnational, homoerotic, and anti-capitalist alternative to the respectable modern nation depended on a construction of masculinity similar to that of cultural nationalists in the anglophone Caribbean, Harlem and Europe.

</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
The heroines of Rhys's 1930s novels are white women with family roots in the tropics who allow European patriarchy and capitalist modernity to wear down their slim identities and bodies. As such, they hardly seem to be engaged in the same battle as McKay and his manly black heroes. Nonetheless, nearly all Rhys's early book-length works engage critically with modernist art. While McKay addresses modernist primitivism through his black male community, Rhys does so through her white heroines who represent female and colonized identities. In "Triple Sec," <i>Quartet</i>,and <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>, posing for artists excludes women from respectable womanhood and even humanity, while the aging heroine of <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> reconres the power dynamics of modernist art and prostitution and participates in a new and empowering primitivism.

<p>
Rhys's first depiction of posing nude illustrates the modern artist's participation in patriarchal and colonial discourses. In "Triple Sec," an adaptation of Rhys's diaries, the heroine Suzy Gray turns to modeling as a means of gaining financial independence in the wake of sexual affairs that disqualify her for marriage. Suzy poses for Tommie, a spry and petite portrait artist, whom Carole Angier argues is William Orpen. As a realist painter, Orpen did not participate in modernist primitivism, yet he painted nudes and shared the racial and sexual assumptions underlying modernist and avant-garde representations of female nudes. His then prominent painting, "A Woman" , depicts a lithe subject, whose eye confronts the spectator and perhaps her lover as she lies at the edge of an unmade bed (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). "A Woman" outraged the bourgeoisie and caused controversy in Dublin where Orpen painted it. Orpen described the difficulty of challenging moral and aesthetic sensibilities in dramatic terms 


<b></b>


in a series of sketches which concluded with the caption, "Portrait of a young man trying the impossible in Dublin" (cited in <i>OMA</i>, 177). The model was Flossie Burnett, a working-class English woman, who was probably Orpen's lover at the time. She was also the model for his self-reflexive 1911 canvas "A model" (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). In this canvas, Orpen painted himself painting Burnett, sitting nude on the rough zebra-hide cushions of his studio couch under a framed copy of the 1906 painting (<i>OMA</i>, 179-81). Burnett's position as Orpen's lover, and the fact that she posed nude on zebra hide, indicate that even in Orpen's relatively respectable and realist studio, the female nude was often a sexualized re linked to the exotic. "The Model"  is also an important element in our discussion of Rhys because it represents the genre Rhys's literary representations of posing speak to&#x02014;the portrait of the painter and his model.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

Rhys's representation of the artist and his model reveals the hierarchical and sexual relations that Orpen's "The Model" omits. In "Triple Sec," Tommie gives voice to the exoticism and sexualization implicit in Orpen's portraits of Burnett. While Burnett appears confident and sultry in Orpen's depiction, Suzy reveals that the process of stripping in front of a painter is so humiliating it brings her to tears. Oblivious to Suzy's modesty and the respectable girlhood which taught it to her, Tommie sees Suzy only as a sexually available and beautiful woman. He announces, "I say you're . . . a beautiful person, aren't you?" He follows this up with a multitude of directions that Rhys reduces to the phrase "I want&#x02014;" followed by ellipses signaling the artist's dominance and his sexual desire. These conditions make Suzy feel "worse and worse" until she "knelt down and put [her] head on [her] arm and cried and cried."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  When she cries, he stops painting and Suzy, like <i>Banjo</i>'s Ray, has succeeded in stopping the alienating production of modern art. The effect, however, seems quite the opposite of Ray's more 


<b></b>


macho escape from modeling. Tommie uses the hiatus to literally sexualize Suzy. He takes her into his arms and kisses her, repeatedly calling her a "beautiful strange nymph" and a "strange, strange girl." His repetition of "strange" highlights the word, suggesting that it might serve also as a double entendre, punning on the French, <i>&#x000E9;trange</i>, for "foreign." Suzy immediately asks: "why do you call me 'strange'?" Tommie responds, "you are strange . . . with your slanting eyes" ("TS," 135). The slanting eyes suggests that he sees Suzy as Asian&#x02014;perhaps as part of an "orientalist" idea of sexualized woman.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Also in contrast to Ray, who rejects the exoticization and feminization of posing nude, Suzy accepts the position of sexualized and exotic nymph. She accepts the job, the kisses, and the gift of a sexy dress appropriate only for trips to find men in a club tellingly called "The Empire." Rhys emphasizes that Suzy's experience as a model excludes her from respectability when she portrays Suzy's confrontation with one of Tommie's portraits. The subject of the portrait, a wealthy English lady, insults Suzy: "Little girl, you're part of a side of life that I don't care to think about. Go away!" ("TS," 138)

Yet within this humiliating and exoticizing engagement with modern art, there lies potential for liberation. Suzy comments: "I think the work is good for me. Also his always telling me how beautiful I am is helping me to look better <i>strangely</i> enough" ("TS," 137, my emphasis). Tommie's recognition of Suzy's beauty may classify Suzy as oriental sexpot and exclude her from the colonial and respectable world of her childhood. Yet in marking their exclusion from respectable womanhood, modern art ultimately provides Rhys's heroines with the potential for countering their social alienation, just as modernist aesthetics would allow Rhys to articulate a new and critical modernist primitivism. However, Rhys's early heroines could not realize this potential until they had expressed and reconred the dynamics of modernist art.


<b></b>


<p>
For Marya Zelli, the heroine of Rhys's first novel <i>Quartet</i>, posing for artists reveals her sexual exploitation and her foreignness, her exclusion from respectable womanhood and national citizenship. In her next novel, <i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>, however, the heroine Julia Martin sees great power in understanding or mastering the dynamics of modernist art. Julia recounts her experience as a model to George Horsfield, an Englishman who is beginning an ambivalent affair with her. Her story has the power to transform. It fills Mr. Horsfield with "warm humanity" and makes him see Julia as a human being to be treated with dignity and sensitivity. Julia explains to George that she once worked as a model for a mean artist named Ruth, and that one day she found herself telling Ruth "Everything that happened to me as far as I could" (<i>ALMM</i>, 51-2).<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  This desire to tell her life story may reflect a desire to counteract the self-negating process of being a modernist model. All the time that she tells the story, however, Julia feels judged by Ruth, and yet more importantly, by a Modigliani painting of a nude woman with a face like an African mask that looked down on her from the wall in Ruth's studio. Julia describes the nude as "having a lovely, lovely body, oh, utterly lovely" and yet being "an utterly lovely proud animal. And a face like a mask, a long dark face, and very big eyes. The eyes were black like a mask, but when you had looked at it a bit it was as if you were looking at a real woman, a live woman . . . " Julia felt the nude exerted an authority she lacked. As a consequence, she got "'a <i>beastly</i> feeling . . .&#x02014;that I didn't quite believe myself, either. I thought: 'After all, is this true? Did I ever do this?'" She perceives the modernist painting asserting "'I am more real than you. But at the same time I am you. I'm all that matters of you'" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41). This experience has a paradoxical effect. On the one hand, it makes Julia feel "beastly"--a negative version of the loveliness and pride of the painted woman's animal-ness&#x02014;and makes her see herself as identity-less. She realizes that she's lost "my marriage-book and my passport. And the papers about my baby who died and was buried in Hamburg." Without this documentation of her national citizenship and respectable womanhood, Julia feels "as if all my life and all myself were floating away from me like smoke . . . " as if she were "looking over the edge of the world" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41). At the same time, Julia recognizes this apparent loss of self as offering her great knowledge. She concludes that "I was frightened, and yet I knew that if I could get to the end of what I was feeling it would be the truth about myself and about the world and about everything that one puzzles and pains about all the time" (<i>ALMM</i>, 41).

<p>
Julia Martin stops short of articulating her feeling and gaining its power. In Rhys's next novel, <i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, however, the protagonist Sasha Jensen more successfully negotiates the power dynamics of modern art, and Rhys herself produces a new and empowering modernist primitivism. In it, the male artist paints himself as primitive, and the prostitute is a man. The heroine is a white woman from the tropics who is estranged from her husband. Rhys parallels the life of her heroine with that of a Jewish painter, a Martinican woman, and a stateless Gigolo. These parallels suggest the potential for an alliance between disparate race, class, and religious groups, marginalized and divided from each other by modern European discourses. Ultimately this alternative community is unable to cohere, but out of the parallels and alliances 


<b></b>


Rhys imagines comes a modernist art in which creator, subject, and consumer are equals in a way which recalls the power dynamics surrounding Banjo's orchestra.

<p>
<i>Good Morning Midnight</i> envisions this new modernism in the interstices of Europe's modernist capital, Paris, and in the shadow of the Exhibition Internationale des Arts et des Technique Appliqu&#x000E9;s &#x000E0; la vie moderne, which represented the hegemonic and alienating national powers of modernity (<i>JR</i>, 144). There Sasha finds herself in the studio of Serge Rubin, a modernist artist and Jewish refugee from Russia.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  This studio provides an escape for Sasha from the demoralizing alienation of modern European society; it enables her to reestablish her connections to her self and to other vulnerable people&#x02014;a Jewish refugee and an Afro-Caribbean woman particularly. It is a temporary space like the caf&#x000E9; African in <i>Banjo</i>, where the characters can produce art and in which the writer can redefine modernist primitivism. Sasha's studio and Banjo's orchestra function, I suggest, as res for Rhys's and McKay's artistic production in the interstices of European modernity. Like their protagonists, they create modernist art amid the uncertainty of imperfect social alliances, temporary shelter, and inadequate funding. These interstitial European spaces offered McKay and Rhys what the homelands they so frequently imagined could not: the opportunity to participate in and redefine modernism as well as to escape the rigid cultural and sexual expectations of Caribbean colonial society.

<p>
In Rubin's studio, Rhys and her heroine reconre the relationship of modernism to empire and primitivism. Sasha arrives not as a model, but as a potential, if impoverished, buyer. In this position of relative equality with the artist, she achieves a sense of power and self-knowledge. Unlike Suzy, Marya, or Julia, Sasha can refuse the role of primitive. She declines Serge's invitation to dance to a Martinican beguine, preferring to watch as he dances with an African mask over his face, in a move that seems to recall the blank mask face of the Modigliani nude that confronts Julia in<i>After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie</i>. Sasha asks, "'West African masks?'" and Rubin responds, "'Yes, straight from the Congo . . . . I made them.'"<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This exchange reflects two alienating elements of European modernist aesthetics. First, modernism tended to homogenize Africa (Rubin and Sasha seem to suggest that the Congo, the "heart" of Africa in much European discourse, is also West Africa). Secondly, by showing a Russian Jew making African masks, Rhys emphasizes the constructed nature of the primitive in modern art.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Further, Julia identifies the mask as representing not African culture but Englishness, commenting, "I know that face very well; I've seen lots like it, complete with legs and body . . . That's the way they look when they are saying: 'Why didn't you drown yourself in the Seine?': . . . 'Who are you, anyway? Who's your father and have you got any money, and if not, why not? Are you one of us?'" (<i>GMM</i>, 92). Rubin reinforces the association of the English with the primitive by asserting that while living in England, he felt "as if a large derri&#x000E8;re was sitting on me" (<i>GMM</i>, 81). This statement inverts the European discursive tradition of representing black sexuality by identifying large buttocks with English people rather than with the exoticized "Hottentot Venus." Rhys's depiction of the primitive as a European construction furthers the deconstruction of whiteness in many of her works. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, for 


<b></b>


instance, she presents her heroines' whiteness as a relative category, fashioned through respectability, class, and geography. 

<p>
In contrast to Pascin and Modigliani, Rubin paints himself as the primitive and this new relationship between the artist and the primitive subject has a transformative effect on Sasha. She "unroll[s] the picture and the man standing in the gutter, playing his banjo, stares at me. He is gentle, humble, resigned, mocking, a little mad. He stares at me . . . I stare back at him" (<i>GMM</i>, 109). She stares at the painting, as Suzy stared at the lady's portrait and Julia stared at Modigliani's nude, but Sasha is not alienated. Rather she sees herself separated and in some ways liberated from a history of humiliation and want&#x02014;"I stare back at him and think about being hungry, being cold, being hurt, being ridiculed, as if it were in another life than this" (<i>GMM</i>, 109). Once the power dynamics of modernism have been reconred, modernist aesthetics can be used to counteract the alienating effects of high modernism on marginalized res such as white creole women.

<p>
In the Caf&#x000E9; African, McKay redefined the primitive as modern and masculine, jettisoning modern Europe's feminization of blackness. In Rubin's studio, Rhys's character begins to free herself from the alienating constraints of modern European womanhood&#x02014;the white, wealthy, wives who look down, "safe as houses," at other women who must attempt and yet always fail to conform. Rhys shows marginalized women policing and chastising themselves as they attempt and fail to meet the ideals of bourgeois womanhood. Sasha constantly monitors her performance against these standards and rails against herself when she slips. Emery observes that it is through Rubin and his artwork that "the miracle" happens and Sasha is "happy" (<i>JR</i>,83). While Rubin dances with his "African mask" to Martinican music, Sasha reconnects to her identity and rediscovers her agency. I follow Emery's reading of this scene and differ primarily in emphasis. While Emery emphasizes the mask's participation in English authority, I regard the mask as significant for modernist primitivism and Rhys's previous depictions of modernist art (<i>JR</i>, 159). All of a sudden, Sasha is "lying in a hammock looking up into the branches of a tree. The sound of the sea advances and retreats as if a door were being opened and shut. All day there has been a fierce wind blowing, but at sunset it drops. The hills look like clouds and the clouds like fantastic hills" (<i>GMM</i>,92). Emery sees in this image a photograph of Rhys her husband took on their 1936 trip to Dominica (<i>JR</i>, 158). The blurring of hills and clouds indicates that Sasha can begin to escape the constraints of her marginalized and disenfranchised place in European society and imagine herself as whole and legitimate. In contrast, when her infant son died, she chided herself for assuming that she could transcend the marginalized space society allotted her&#x02014;"the clouds are clouds, trees are trees, people are people, and that's that. Don't mix them up again" (<i>GMM</i>, 139).

<p>
It is important that this engagement with modernist primitivism corresponds to a greater identification, on Sasha's part, with her own origins and with Afro-Caribbean women. As Sasha and Rubin listen to Martinican music and discuss black music, she begins to cry; "le peintre" accepts her weeping, explaining that he too weeps. (There is a strong contrast here between Rubin and male characters in earlier novels by Rhys 


<b></b>


who respond to the heroines' sadness and malaise by alienating, seducing, or criticizing them.) Rubin tells her the story of a Martinican woman who had been made "no longer quite human, no longer quite alive" by English people who humiliated her because she was black and unmarried. Sasha exclaims that the woman is "exactly like me," because like Sasha she weeps and drinks, but Rubin convinces her that the Martinican was "not like [her] at all" (<i>GMM</i>, 79). Rhys illustrates both the similarities and differences between Sasha and the nameless woman of Martinique. Both women are excluded from respectable womanhood, but Rubin's story makes it clear that as a white woman, Sasha has escaped the physical devastation and cruel taunts inflicted on the other woman by English children. Thus while European modernism tended to blur such distinctions, Rhys delineates between white and brown creole women even as she points to the shared ground of their marginality. Sasha and Rubin strongly empathize with the Martinican woman but do not claim her experiences as their own (<i>GMM</i>, 81). The studio provides a space for this partial and temporary alliance to be imagined much as the caf&#x000E9; African provided a temporary space for McKay's community of black men. But both in <i>Good Morning Midnight</i> and <i>Banjo</i>, these new alliances and communities are vulnerable to the combined threat of nationalism and capitalism. 

<p>
Rhys's engagement with modernism and her reconration of its primitivism involves a reexamination of the nature of sexuality. Transgressing nearly all bourgeois norms for female sexuality, Rhys's heroines are in full revolt against respectable womanhood. They have affairs before and outside marriage, and fail as mothers by having abortions and letting their infant children die. This revolt also takes the form of imagining loving relationships with other women. In "Triple Sec," Suzy is loved by a friend, Jennie, who caresses her in bed, cares for her after her abortion, and introduces her to her "career of modeling." When Suzy plans to move to New York, Jennie cries: "Oh Suzy, I love you and now you're going out of my life!" ("TS," 78). In<i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, Sasha has a similarly affectionate relationship with a sad woman named Lise, whom she loves (<i>GMM</i>, 133-4).

<p>
Redefining the elements of modernist primitivism that exoticized black and female sexuality enables Sasha to love women. For Ren&#x000E9;, the gigolo in <i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, homosexuality is simply an alternative to heterosexuality. He explains to Sasha that he "tried [to love boys] in Morocco, but it was no use." However, he asks Sasha if she likes girls, and when she replies in the negative, he seems incredulous, "'What, have you never in your life seen a girl you could have loved?'" Sasha must then concur, "Yes, once I did. I saw a girl in a bordel I could have loved." Ren&#x000E9; is amused, "Oh, how convenient!" but Sasha has a different type of love in mind, much like her love of Lise. She asks herself, "Now, why has this girl suddenly come up out of the past? She wasn't beautiful, not a star at all. I expect she didn't have a very good time. But I wanted to put my arms round her, kiss her eyes and comfort her&#x02014;and if that's not love, what is?" (<i>GMM</i>, 160). In "Triple Sec," Suzy acknowledges but does not actively return Jennie's love. Having begun the process of reconring her relationship to art and men, Sasha can love a woman without placing herself in a perverse or pathological classification, which would have been impossible as the sexualized and exoticized object of the combined


<b></b>


forces of patriarchal men and modernist art. Similarly, it is only at the end of <i>Banjo</i>, once McKay has shown that European conceptions of black sexuality and respectable heterosexuality are implicated in colonial exploitation, that he can present Ray and Banjo as a pair of strong men.

<p>
These transgressive and alternative sexualities are also inextricably linked to the characters' statelessness and internationalism. Characters are able to form social and sexual alliances that counter the alienating effects of capitalism, colonialism, and bourgeois respectability only once they have physically and intellectually abandoned their nationality. Ray denounces nations as hypocritical and exploitative entities; Banjo renounces his citizenship. Sasha goes by a nationality that belongs to a lost husband and apparently has none of her own.

<p>
McKay and Rhys&#x02014;like their protagonists&#x02014;disrupt the process of modernist representation and restore agency to the objectified models in modernist art. Their rejection of the nation state and their use of transgressive sexuality as a form of resistance also had strong implications for the political and literary nationalisms emerging in the Caribbean in the 1920s and 1930s. Writers engaged in establishing national literatures were strongly influenced by European models of cultural nationalism that called for national cultures based on the folk, a population which in the Caribbean largely rejected legal marriage in favor of "common-law" unions. At the same time, these writers internalized European models of political nationalism which saw Christian marriage and middle class gender roles as necessary to modern nationhood. Thus writers invested in establishing national literatures could not completely abandon European middle class sexual and gender norms. Even writers sharply critical of respectability such as the Jamaican poet and playwright Una Marson and Trinidad's <i>Beacon Group</i> saw central elements of European marriage and gender roles as necessary to the Caribbean's new national cultures and politics. They did not therefore see the nation and respectability as McKay and Rhys saw them&#x02014;as inextricably linked to an international system of oppression structured by capitalism and colonialism. The modernism and primitivism that McKay and Rhys create thus potentially disrupted the emergent literary and political nationalisms of the Caribbean at the same time as they disrupted and challenged European modernist aesthetics.

In the absence of unequivocal evidence, Carole Angier asserts that William Orpen "is most likely" to have painted Rhys given her description of him in "Triple Sec." Angier also notes that Henry Tonks, a professor at the Slade School of Fine Arts, introduced Rhys to another painter from the school where Orpen was a student. See Carole Angier, <i>Jean Rhys: Life and Work</i> (London: Penguin, 1992 [1990]), 80. Like Orpen, Tommie the artist in Rhys's fictional account is a portrait artist, short in stature, and always well dressed; see Bruce Arnold<i>, Orpen: Mirror to an Age</i> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1981; rept. 1982), 180. Henceforth abbreviated as <i>OMA</i>. Tommie is an appropriate name for a character based on Orpen, as Orpen was strongly associated with the soldiers or "Tommies" of World War I whom he honored in his memoirs as well as his painting "To the unknown British soldier in France."

A similar blurring and superimposition occurs in Modigliani's and Kirchner's work. Leo Kirchner, for instance, placed his female Bathers in a room framed by a stylized border derivative of housebeams from the Pelau Islands. In the same time period, he photographed two black models, Sam and Milli, also nude, in a similar frame suggesting that both occupied the same exoticized and sexualized space.

One might compare Pascin's "Temple of Beauty" with Picasso's "Olympia" , which portrays a naked, black woman, with large thighs and pelvis, displayed in a bed, next to which Picasso, small, white, and topless, sits holding fruit. The drawing stands at the end of the genealogy Gilman constructs in the representation of blackness and sexuality in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century art and other discourses. This genealogy begins with Manet's "Olympia" (1862-1863) and other contemporary artwork in which black res signal the sexuality of the scene and in particular of the displayed white woman. In Manet's "Nana"  the black re is no longer needed, Gilman argues, because black sexuality has been incorporated into the white woman's body, in the form of enlarged buttocks reminiscent of the "Hottentot Venus" ("HP," 80-102). Picasso's "Olympia" and Pascin's "Temple of Beauty" are significant because they represent sexualized black women, reworking but not significantly changing the set of equivalences between blackness, excessive sexuality, steatopygia, the primitive and prostitution that modern discourses had been negotiating for nearly a century. Picasso's "Olympia" is of particular importance to this essay because it represents the genre which McKay and Rhys themselves reworked&#x02014;the portrait of the painter with his model.

In chapter two of her current, unpublished manuscript, "Cross-Cultural Modernism: The Politics of Vision in Anglophone Caribbean Literature," Mary Lou Emery argues that Caribbeans constituted a significant presence in the modernist movements of inter-war Europe and that they produced modernist art that both contributed to and challenged high modernist aesthetics.

In emphasizing the subversive power of colonized Caribbean writers re-vising the scene of being painted, I am proposing an argument parallel to Emery's incisive analysis of postcolonial women writers' use of <i>ekphrasis</i>, the literary representation of visual art.

Curiously, the only painter who depicts Le Corse accurately--as a tough pimp of Marseilles&#x02014;is Ivan Opfer. I have found no artist named Opfer, but McKay describes Opfer as a well known British portrait artist. Could he be referring to William Orpen, the artist who painted Rhys? The name Opfer, which means "sacrificial victim" in German, might well be more symbolic than accurate. Opfer would be an appropriate pseudonym for Orpen, who identified so strongly with the sacrifice of WWI soldiers that, when commissioned to paint the dignitaries who signed the treaty of Versailles, he erased all the politicians and put a coffin of the unknown British soldier in their place. See <i>OMA</i>, 377-80 and Sidney Dark and P. G. Konody, <i>Sir William Orpen: Artist &amp; Man</i> (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1926), 101. McKay worked as a journalist in England at the time of the armistice and would likely have known of the controversy surrounding Orpen's painting. In <i>LWH</i>, Le Corse gives Opfer's portrait away, despite its significant value, because it renders him with a harsh honesty. Orpen was noted for his penetrating gaze and refusing to romanticize those he painted. During WWI, he worked as a war painter for the British government. In his memoir, Orpen condemns brothels and mentions frequent trips to "these dens of filth to drag fine men away from disease." See William Orpen, <i>An Onlooker in France 1917-1919</i> (Williams and Norgate: London, 1921, 16-7). His paintings, "Adam and Eve at P&#x000E9;ronne" (Plate 15) and "Changing Billets" (Plate 23), express his critical vision of prostitutes as dangerous and seductive. Thus Opfer was familiar with French brothels as were Picasso and Pascin, but unlike them, did not see prostitutes as sites of liberation from bourgeois constraints. His critical view of prostitution suggests that if he ever did paint a portrait of "Le Corse," he would have portrayed him in starkly negative terms. If Orpen is indeed the model for Opfer, it would provide further evidence that Rhys and McKay were creating modernist aesthetics in relation to the same res and issues in modern European art.

In his analysis of this scene, Michael North focuses on the fact that Ray is the ideal primitive because he has an intellectual and Western education.

As Heather Hathaway and many others have noted, McKay was not alone in turning to the primitive as an aesthetic technique and antidote to the "alienation of the modern world." See Hathaway, <i>Caribbean Waves</i>, 60. Alain Locke advocated primitivism for African American art. David Nicholls has argued that the folk and the primitive were so central to Harlem Renaissance writers that their modernist aesthetics were innovative forms of primitivism. See David Nicholls, <i>Conjuring the Folk: Forms of Modernity in African America</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000), 131-3. Similarly Tracey McCabe argues that McKay belongs to a tradition of Harlem Renaissance writers who employed primitivism to articulate a black modernist aesthetic and a counter-discourse to anti-black stereotypes. McCabe argues that McKay's modernist primitivism challenges this tradition by presenting Africa in the present tense and as male rather than as a lost mother of a lost golden age. See Tracey McCabe, "The Multi-faceted Politics of Primitivism in Harlem Renaissance Writing," <i>Soundings</i> 80:4 (Winter 1997), 475-97, 478.

Coincidentally, Rubin is not unlike Jules Pascin who befriended McKay. Both were quirky modernist artists and eastern European Jews in Paris.

Among her meditations on French character and "civilisation," Gertrude Stein's <i>Paris France</i>  includes a quick dismissal of the "sur-realist crowd":



<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
That was really the trouble with the sur-realist crowd, they missed their moment of becoming civilized, they used their revolt, not as a private but as a public thing, they wanted publicity not civilisation, and so really they never succeeded in being peaceful and exciting.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>
 

<p>
This passage may seem counter-intuitive coming from Stein, who is often seen as a paradigmatic re of the avant-garde and who regularly demonstrated her own genius at cultivating and negotiating publicity. The "sur-realist crowd," representatives <i>par excellence</i> of what Peter B&#x000FC;rger has termed "the historical avant-garde," would seem a group for whom Stein would feel affinities rather than antagonism, not least a shared desire for publicity.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But here and elsewhere in <i>Paris France</i>, Stein develops a set of subtle distinctions between her own project and the surrealist project. While her version of publicity embraces literary institutions and their role in creating literary history, the surrealist version depends on claims to pure originality and revolt. While her project celebrates an ideal of "civilisation" built over time through an accretion of daily behaviors, the Surrealists' preoccupation with "revolt" leads them to miss "their moment of becoming civilized." While Stein applies a dialectical understanding 


<b></b>


of habit as both stultifying <i>and</i> enabling of original thought and action, the Surrealist movement depends on the fiction that one can dispense with habits of thought and action altogether. While gradualism, accretion, continuity, and recontextualization define Stein's work, she sees the surrealist movement as characterized by iconoclasm, rupture, and opposition.

<p>
In this paper I distinguish Stein's project from the surrealist project, and from avant-garde projects more generally, by defining a version of modernism that grows out of American pragmatism rather than out of a continental avant-garde tradition. The two movements are not as distant as one might think; indeed, Ross Posnock argues that pragmatism shares a good deal with the avant-garde, including commitments to replacing "theory with practice, the a priori with contingency, clarity with shock, [and] information with immersion."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Despite these similarities, the dominance of the avant-garde tradition in historical, theoretical, and philosophical narratives of modernism has obscured one of pragmatism's most characteristic and potentially useful contributions to theories of art, culture, and politics: its commitment to what I call a "recontextualizing" rather than an "oppositional" mode of criticism.

<p>
Despite many influential revisions of modernism&#x02014;under the banners of feminism, racial politics, and mass culture, to name just a few&#x02014;the oppositional model associated with avant-gardism remains dominant. Not only does this model continue to set the terms of discussion for questions of modernism and avant-gardism, but it seems more generally to define popular understandings of "political art." Andreas Huyssen, for example, in his influential treatment of modernism and mass culture, describes the avant-garde in the language of opposition, claiming that the avant-garde depends upon an "iconoclastic and anti-aesthetic ethos, which attempt[s] to break the political bondage of high culture . . . and to integrate art into life."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Likewise, in B&#x000FC;rger's terms, avant-garde movements aim to produce for their readers and viewers an effect of "shock . . . as a stimulus to change one's conduct of life; it is the means to break through aesthetic immanence and to usher in (initiate) a change in the recipient's life praxis" (<i>TAG</i>, 80).

<p>
This model, with its emphasis on breaking through, shock, or, as Posnock puts it, "heroic opposition and a shattering of conventions," has offered a potent alternative to bourgeois complacency for generations of avant-garde artists and theorists. At the same time, its dominance renders illegible other forms of innovative or radical artistic work and other styles of navigation between the aesthetic and the social. "This understanding of cultural critique," continues Posnock, "forecloses a subtler, if less glamorous, alternative, one founded on the mundane fact that our experience of the social order is one of contradiction&#x02014;that we are at once within and without it."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The "subtler, if less glamorous alternative" that I call "pragmatic modernism" thus defies traditional understandings of modernism and of cultural critique. It works within institutions; it prefers to educate rather than to convert, to contextualize rather than to defamiliarize. Its power as a mode of critique and as a version of praxis deserves further attention from critics of modernism and within discussions of aesthetics and politics more generally.


<b></b>


<p>
What follows is a preliminary exploration of pragmatic modernism's recontextualizing mode by way of one of its key terms, habit. I take habit as a pragmatist "keyword" in Raymond Williams's sense: a "strong, difficult, and persuasive" word that takes on specialized meanings within the context of pragmatist philosophy, meanings with the potential to significantly enrich and expand our understanding of modernism beyond the oppositional model exemplified by the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 

<p>
In taking pragmatist "habit" as my pivotal term, I hope to illuminate the distinctions and the similarities between avant-gardism and pragmatic modernism. Though William James's definition of habit in <i>Principles of Psychology</i> is straightforward ("habit diminishes the conscious attention with which our acts are performed"), this mundane term takes on global importance for both James and John Dewey, linking the psychological to the social in both men's work.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Though the pragmatists were hardly the first to address the idea of habit&#x02014;Walter Pater had in 1873 declared that "our failure is to form habits"&#x02014;pragmatists took a different approach to the problem than their recent precursors.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Rather than pathologizing habits of thought, as the Romantics and the Aestheticists had done, and calling for an end to or a breaking through of habit, pragmatism saw habit as constitutive of&#x02014;and utterly necessary to&#x02014;thought and social behavior. In returning to this more Aristotelian model, it subtly shifted the meaning of the term. Rather than a set of compulsions or a mere mindless automatism, pragmatist habit was reborn as a site of personal and social potential. 

<p>
For James, the roots of habit are physiological. He argues that "the nervous system" follows old impulses and paths more easily than new ones. But habit also provides a conceptual apparatus through which he links individual nerve endings to social and institutional structures. Habit connects the specific to the abstract and the body to the body politic, in more than a merely metaphorical sense. While it links conceptually the mindless motions of the body to the social mores that determine human values, beliefs, and actions, it also signals an organic conception of history, temporally connecting past behaviors to future impulses. This pragmatist approach to history, in which the past is seen as inevitably influential, for better <i>and</i> for worse, presents a dramatic alternative to visionary and revolutionary rejections of all that had come before.

<p>
Avant-garde theories of art have their own treatments of habit. Shklovsky's famous discussion of defamiliarization in "Art as Technique," for instance, claims that "[h]abitualization devours works, clothes, furniture, one's wife, and the fear of war . . . And art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone <i>stony</i>."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Whether addressed directly or indirectly, habit's numbing, deadening qualities invariably furnish the adversary against which the avant-garde artist must struggle. With habit's anesthetic qualities taken for granted, the manifestoes of avant-garde movements from the Surrealists to the Vorticists focus on the moment of defamiliarization or shock&#x02014;the moment at which daily habits are punctured and illuminations and transrations can take place. Words like "destruction," "negativity," "smash," and "demolition" appear again and again in avant-garde manifestoes, from Futurist images of car crashes and shell explosions to <i>Blast</i>'s call for a cultural violence that will "destroy politeness, standardisation and academic, that is civilized, vision."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 


<b></b>


<p>
Pragmatism, on the other hand, while it shares an interest in revealing invisible habits and in challenging mindless habits of thought, interests itself not only in the moment of shock itself, but also in the moments that precede and follow shock. As Dewey claims in <i>Human Nature and Conduct</i> , 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Without habit there is only irritation and confused hesitation. With habit alone there is a machine-like repetition, duplicating recurrence of old acts. <i>With conflict of habits and release of impulse there is conscious search</i> 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What makes Dewey's discussion characteristically pragmatist is its dialectical treatment of habit. He offers no alternative to habit; no space outside of habit. Rather, he describes how habit permeates every aspect of existence, cushioning us from "irritation and confused hesitation" in our everyday lives. Though he encourages an awareness of habit's anodyne effects, he is also quick to point out that habit's undoing is not achieved through a "dream of romantic freedom, in which <i>all</i> life is plastic to impulse, a continual source of improvised spontaneities and novel inspirations" and in which "[w]e rebel against all organization and all stability" (<i>HNC</i>, 72).

<p>
According to Dewey, new habits come only after a process, initiated by the moment of "conflict" and "release of impulse," which can be compared to the avant-garde moment of shock, and which inspires "conscious search." After this comes a "utilizing [of] released impulse as an agent of steady reorganization of custom and institutions" (<i>HNC</i>, 72). It is this reintegration or recontextualization of released energies back into the social fabric that distinguishes pragmatism from other critical modes of thought. The goal described here is unambiguously <i>not</i> the smashing or shattering of custom and the destruction of institutions, but their "steady reorganization."

<p>
It is easy to see how "steady reorganization" might seem somewhat pedestrian when compared to the aesthetic and political rhetorics of the avant-garde, and these differences of style and tone are reflected in generic differences as well. Along with outrageous and shocking artworks and performances, the avant-garde specialized in manifestoes, provocations, and the definitional founding statements of movements; forms especially conducive to creating flashes of momentary illumination. Pragmatism, on the other hand, developed in the far more mundane contexts of academic lectures, books, and articles, forms well adapted to the institutional contexts in which they were written or delivered. We might imagine here the staid and civilized luncheons of the Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts in relation to the spontaneous revelries of the Surrealists at Au Chien Qui Fume or another Parisian retreat. Coming as they do from different social contexts and devoted as they are to different goals, these two movements have opposing and specialized vocabularies to offer, one a vocabulary of shock and defamiliarization and the other of "steady reorganization." Given their many shared interests and preoccupations, however, and their complementary specializations, it would seem that a greater dialogue between the two traditions could be immensely beneficial to students of both.

<p>
Indeed, if charges of complacency can be reasonably brought against pragmatism for its emphasis on the moment of reintegration over the moment of conflict or rupture


<b></b>


from convention, then the charge of empty radical posturing could be leveled against the avant-garde approach. B&#x000FC;rger insightfully underscores the difficulty with the avant-garde reliance upon shock to do the majority of its political work:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The problem with shock as the intended reaction of the recipient is that it is generally nonspecific . . . [it] does not insure that the recipient's change of behavior is given a particular direction . . . A further difficulty inheres . . . and that is the impossibility to make permanent this kind of effect. Nothing loses its effectiveness more quickly than shock; by its very nature, it is a unique experience . . . The violent reactions of the public to the mere appearance of the Dadaists are an example: newspaper reports had prepared the public for the shock; it expected it. Such a nearly institutionalized shock probably has a minimal effect on the way the recipients run their lives. The shock is 'consumed.'

<p class="noIndent">
It is precisely this question with which pragmatism concerns itself. Assuming that all shock is "consumed," and that this is the process through which habit operates, pragmatism turns its attention to managing the "consumption" of shock, or to the "steady reorganization of custom and institutions" described above. The choice, pragmatism tells us, is not between steady reorganization and total revolution but between steady reorganization and a flash of shock followed by an inevitable reversion to the status quo. Without the recontextualizing component of social change, the energies of shock disperse, leaving mindless habits of thought essentially intact.

<p class="noIndent">
Set against the backdrop of Paris, and offered in the context of urban modernity, Walter Benjamin's essay "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" provides a glimpse of a modernist aesthetic distinct from the shock-centered aesthetic of the avant-garde. Though Benjamin's essay famously treats shock as the herald of modernity, it remains equally (and dialectically) invested in the state against which shock is counterposed in the essay: a state of unconsciousness, of deeply personal memory, of protection from stimuli, of habituated response. This oscillation between habit and shock is presented by Benjamin not as a general philosophical truth but as a peculiarly modernist problematic. Through his reading of Baudelaire, he imagines an aesthetic that remains equally attuned to the power of habit <i>and</i> to modernity's endless jolts to habit, an aesthetic that, like pragmatism, sets these two states in a necessary and ongoing relation to one another.

<p>
Benjamin's sense of habituated unconsciousness, interestingly enough, is taken from Bergson's <i>Matter and Memory</i>, a text that was both influenced by and greatly influential for the work of William James. Bergson, Benjamin claims in his essay, treats "experience" as "a matter of tradition, in collective existence as well as private life. It is less the product of facts firmly anchored in memory than of a convergence in memory of accumulated and frequently unconscious data."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Putting this "accumulated and frequently unconscious data" at the center of experience, and claiming it as a link between 


<b></b>


collective and private existence, Bergson offers a notion of human thought and behavior that powerfully recalls pragmatist habit. Like Dewey and James, he attempts to theorize the difference between conscious and unconscious behaviors, to link the psychological to the social, and to connect impulses of the body with tendencies of the mind.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 

<p>
Benjamin's hesitation about Bergsonian experience is that it creates a dehistoricized and abstracted vision of modernity:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It is . . . not at all Bergson's intention to attach any specific historical label to memory. On the contrary, he rejects any historical determination of memory. He thus manages above all to stay clear of that experience from which his own philosophy evolved or, rather, in reaction to which it arose. It was the inhospitable, blinding age of big-scale industrialism. In shutting out this experience the eye perceives an experience of a complementary nature in the form of its spontaneous afterimage, as it were . . . His philosophy thus indirectly furnishes a clue to the experience which presented itself to Baudelaire's eyes in its undistorted version in the re of his reader. 
<!--_/extract-->

<p class="noIndent">
In other words, Bergsonian experience is as important for what it does not record as for what it does. The "blinding age of big-scale industrialism" determines the nature of both Bergsonian memory and Bergsonian experience, but its traces are concealed. Present as a palpable absence, or "spontaneous afterimage," history is dispersed from experience. As Benjamin goes on to argue, modern shock thus becomes a means of "emancipation from experience"&#x02014;a mode of re-entry into history, into a specific time and place. Shock is also the necessary precondition for consciousness, and, for this reason "Baudelaire placed the shock experience at the very center of his artistic work" ("SMB," 163).

<p>
Benjamin's critique of Bergsonian experience and his description of modern shock thus offer a historicized version of habit perfectly suited to discussions of literary and social modernity. Whereas pragmatism and avant-gardism could each be said to suggest a hierarchy, emphasizing either the constructive, accumulating qualities of habit or the illuminating, defamiliarizing benefits of shock, Benjamin places habit and shock together in the context of the urban crowd, the "industrial work process" ("SMB," 176), the newspaper, and the photograph. For Benjamin the oscillation between shock and habit, between conscious and unconscious behavior, is defined and limited not only by the romantic spontaneity of the avant-garde artist or the "steady reorganization" of the pragmatist social engineer but by the ruling social conditions as well. Benjamin rejects the avant-gardist's romantic celebration of shock as a sign of modernity working exclusively against the primitive habits of the past. At the same time, he complicates and contextualizes the pragmatist tendency to see better habits of the future as an emancipation from the outmoded metaphysics of revolution. He puts both habit and shock in their historical place: the repetitions of series production and the explosion of the flashbulb become representations of a dialectic of habit newly charged with social meaning.

<p>
To read habit through Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire is to illuminate elements of his work not easily assimilable to received notions of avant-gardism. By reading modern 


<b></b>


shock against Bergsonian experience, Benjamin contextualizes both the romanticized notion of the oppositional hero-artist and the abstract philosophical pendulum-swing of habit. In so doing, Benjamin's essay demonstrates a set of relationships and a mode of analysis representative of pragmatic modernism. Just as Benjamin's interest in unconscious habit (or Bergsonian experience) would never be read as complacency or as satisfaction with the status quo, pragmatic modernism's recontextualizing mode should not be read as antithetical to engaged criticism. Rather, it should be read as a mode of criticism that distinguishes itself from the powerful ideology of oppositional criticism, one that interests itself both in moments of shock and rupture and in the historical conditions and surrounding events that produce and respond to such moments. 

<p>
It is in this light that I read Stein's discussion of the relation between publicity, in the form of an attention-grabbing performance or outrageous manifesto, and civilization, in the form of daily behaviors accumulated over time. Her criticism of the Surrealists grows out of more than mere rivalry and can be read as an endorsement of the recontextualizing mode. As with Benjamin, Stein's interest in the power of habit is animated by historically specific energies&#x02014;discussions of war, mechanical reproduction, cinema, and national identity are each linked to habit's dialectic. In the following sections, I turn to Stein, an author usually subsumed to the tradition of avant-garde modernism, to show at greater length what pragmatic modernism looks like in action.

<p class="noIndent">
Habit in Stein, as in James and Dewey, is never merely a problem to be overcome, a failure of imagination, or a "machine-like repetition" (<i>HNC</i>, 126). It is the smallest component part into which thought and behavior can be broken down, and through which they are built back up. Stein takes as one of her most serious engagements the duty of rendering habit visible: from the minutiae of daily life, to textual "habits" such as punctuation and clich&#x000E9;, to the habits that constitute national identity, to the collective habits of thought that create institutions and literary canons. Even Stein's most radically experimental works famously achieve their difficulty through repetitions. Her readers face not shocks <i>per se</i> but habit made visible through sheer exaggeration. Rhythms and repetitions are far more important in Stein than are pronouncements; her vision of literature is expressed more through a logic of duration than it is through such world-altering Poundian cries as "Make it new!" Stein's most outrageous claims tend not to gain power from the intensity of her conviction nor the purity of her expression, but rather from an intensifying effect&#x02014;a snowballing logic of repetition and amplification. Indeed, the concept of habit takes us through a set of highly diverse and seemingly incommensurable areas of the Steinian corpus, from sentences to theories, and from her most accessible works to her most experimental.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein drew important connections between her work and the cinema.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Like her fascination with what she calls "series production," this connection is at once formal and historical. On the one hand, she is responding to the stylistic similarities between 


<b></b>


her own literary innovations and the cinema's use of repetition, of accumulating photographic frames linked together to form a narrative. On the other hand, she is responding to the historical contexts in which she is creating these stylistic innovations. As she puts it in "Portraits and Repetition":

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I was doing what the cinema was doing, I was making a continuous succession of the statement of what that person was until I had not many things but one thing . . . I of course did not think of it in terms of the cinema, in fact I doubt whether at any time I had ever seen a cinema but, and I cannot repeat this too often any one is of one's period and this our period was undoubtedly the period of the cinema and series production. And each of us in our own way are bound to express what the world in which we are living is doing.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's manifest argument in this quotation is that history determines style, that "any one is of one's period," and that her work was thus of its moment, profoundly modern in the sense that "the cinema and series production" were modern. But we might also read her comment in the opposite direction. That is, her understanding of cinema is in some senses determined by her investment in a pragmatist discourse of habit, allowing her to see in the mechanized and repetitive forms of "cinema and series production" a metaphor for her own work and her own vision of habitual repetitions. Just as Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire contextualizes habit within the social settings of modernity, Stein's pragmatic modernism helps to reinvest the mechanized modern language of series production and repetition with the humanized, individuated energy of daily habits and behaviors.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<p>
At the same time, Stein's comments about the cinema capture her ability to insert herself into historical narratives&#x02014;literary, cultural, technological&#x02014;in order to fortify and reinscribe her own position as a public re and famous author. This adds another element&#x02014;one we might label "marketing" or indeed "publicity"&#x02014;which complicates Stein's relation to the cinema, and to mass culture more generally. Stein clearly and unsentimentally saw her work and her literary personality as commodities, and in 1936 she went so far as to write enthusiastically to Thornton Wilder about the possibility of making <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> into a Hollywood film:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
listen Thornton, couldn't they do the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas at Hollywood, that might make a lovely film, I do not know what makes lovely films but that might and they could shoot the background here and in Paris and we could be taken in Hollywood including the puppies Basket and Pepe and we would have enough money to make a leisurely trip across the continent and the Mississippi valley taking on a college boy for the more difficult driving and then we could have an installation in Washington Square and go to and fro for ever. Do you think there is anything in it, I am not just perfectly sure there isn't.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What appears as Stein's characteristic faux-na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9; ("I do not know what makes lovely films but that might") in this passage can also be seen as a clever meditation on her own public image. Reasonably enough, Stein feels that a film would be a good source 


<b></b>


of income and that it would give her and Alice an excuse to return to the United States after her triumphant lecture tour of 1934-1935. At the same time, she seems to be suggesting that she and Alice (not to mention the dogs Basket and Pepe) would actually be the stars of the film. Further, she chooses to imagine that the making of this film would be an infinite process, allowing Stein to "have an installation in Washington Square and go to and fro for ever." The letter takes the mythology of Stein's private life&#x02014;her travels by automobile with Alice, their households at Bilignin and at Paris, their love for their dogs, and so forth&#x02014;and offers it as material for a film, making explicit her conviction that it constitutes an appropriate, even an ideal, subject of public interest.

<p>
The boundaries between the fictional world of this film and the creation of her own public identity and private life are so artfully blurred in this description as to suggest a real insight into Stein's conception of her life and public image. Indeed, though such a film was never made, the idea of the film is a resonant one for our understanding of Stein's self-creation as a public re. It is easy to imagine that Stein conceived of herself as though she were the star of an ongoing film. As is indicated by the pleasure she takes in imagining her own mythology in cinematic terms (in the idiom of modern commercial culture), her work and her thought were thoroughly permeated with moments of self-conscious salesmanship. This salesmanship functioned very much as a mode of mediation, a way of negotiating the relationship between her stylistic experiments and her historical moment. Such a self-conscious negotiation and manipulation of her work within her social context, furthermore, required a vastly sophisticated grasp of the complicated interrelationships between daily life, the marketplace, literary history, and literary and educational institutions. Habit also functioned for Stein as the key to these relationships.

<p>
Recent work on modernism has attempted to think across Huyssen's "great divide," and to bring modernism into contact with commercial culture in a variety of different ways.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Stein's deep understanding of and investment in commercial culture, her interest in self-promotion, and her sophisticated marketing skills have made her a prime candidate for just this sort of rereading. For Stein, there was no choice to be made between literary institutions and avant-garde proclamations&#x02014;the failure of the Surrealists as she describes it in <i>Paris France</i> is evidence of this very impossibility. It is a mistake to want "publicity not civilisation," but it is not a mistake to want publicity; the crucial failure is the failure to grasp the necessary and ongoing relation between the two. The recontextualizing stance exemplified by Stein demanded both an acceptance and a deep understanding of the ways in which literary institutions, national identities, and individual thoughts and actions were built upon long years of accrued habit. Stein's approach to publicity maintained a dialectical connection to "civilisation" that she felt the Surrealists had sacrificed too quickly.

<p>
The image of Stein as an impresario on her own behalf&#x02014;in public and in private&#x02014;is perhaps most succinctly captured in the imprint at the top of her 27 Rue de Fleurus stationery, which bore a tiny rose surrounded by circular typeface reading "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  This stunningly resonant image functions precisely the way a trademark functions in legal terms, as a synecdoche for a product, a guarantee of quality, 


<b></b>


a form of consumer protection, but most importantly as a way of fostering "brand recognition."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Most striking about Stein's choice of phrases to represent her "brand name" is that as much as this choice is a form of self-creation, it relies as well on public constructions of her identity. The phrase "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" was adopted very early on as a public shorthand for Stein's repetitions and obscurity of meaning, a sort of popular Zen koan meant to stand in for all of Stein's work. By enthusiastically acceding to the idea that this single phrase could somehow capture the complexity of her work, Stein intentionally plays on the public's existing image of her, embroidering and engraving it into her daily life and circulating it within her personal correspondence. Such a combination of "publicity" and "civilisation" demonstrates Stein's genius for self-promotion, her canny manipulation of simplification and repetition, and her deep respect for the powerful ripples sent out by private, daily life.

<p>
These ripples are strongly felt in <i>Paris France</i>, not only in Stein's discussions of the relation between publicity and civilization, but in her vision of national identities as constituted through and by the accretion of daily habits. Indeed, in <i>Paris France</i> "civilisation" is not only what she misses in the work of the Surrealists, it is also a shorthand for French culture, a culture Stein reveres for its ability to balance respect for the past with unperturbed adaptability in the face of modernity. As Stein puts it, "It is nice in France they adapt themselves to everything slowly they change completely but all the time they know that they are as they were" (<i>PF</i>, 16). 

<p>
"Civilisation" is composed of a complex amalgamation of minutiae (daily behaviors and habits) and generalities (national beliefs and ideologies), in combinations that sometimes appear intuitive and at other times are quite surprising. It is typical of Stein, for example, to find the essence of French identity in a place as distant from the clich&#x000E9;d shorthands of berets or the Marseillaise as can be imagined:

<blockquote class="extract">

But the thing that was most exciting were the knives and forks. The knives had been sharpened so much that the blade was as thin as a dagger with a slight bend on top and the forks so light that when you pressed on them they bent.

It may seem strange that a humble&#x02014;if acute and incisive&#x02014;knife and fork would be asked to stand in for the entirety of French civilization. It is precisely the banality of the objects, however, and the dailiness of their use that qualifies them to be, in Stein's words, "the most passionately french things I knew, I might say I ever knew." For Stein, the continual accumulation of daily experiences and habits creates a shared literary, philosophical, and national history that is evoked by the use and recollection of such objects as knives and forks.

<p>
More specifically, what makes these knives and forks so "passionately french" is the way they both represent history and bend to present circumstance. They had been "sharpened so much that the blade was as thin as a dagger," while at the same time they were "so light that when you pressed on them they bent." In other words, it is through the accumulation of a long and noble history of daily use that these knives and forks have acquired their flexibility, their adaptability. This combination of respect for 


<b></b>


the past and flexibility about the future captures perfectly Stein's sense of French culture more generally. Her vision of national identity, and of history, depends upon her respect for the power and importance of daily repetitions and accumulations. She insists that habits can accrue a historical and a national weight even as they remain flexible to future needs. 

<p>
But Stein specifically credits French culture with understanding both the inevitability and the crucial importance of habits established over many long years. It is because of the power and command of habit in France&#x02014;because it is a culture that has an answer for every question, a solution to every problem, a technique for every undertaking&#x02014;that Stein sees it as "where the twentieth century was:"<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

As the final line of this passage indicates, <i>Paris France</i>'s interest in French civilization is an interest developed very much in the shadow of the two World Wars. Stein's discussions of civilization explicitly link questions of national identity to international politics. However, they also link national identity to publicity, to literary tradition and literary history, and to Stein's own role as a public re and famous author. When she claims that France formed the "background for the twentieth century," she means in part that it provided a background for her and her circle. In the lectures delivered during her lecture tour of 1934-1935, these links between daily life, national identity, and literary history are made explicit in order to foreground and explain the importance of her own work.

<p>
<i>Lectures in America</i>, the volume that resulted from this tour, is made up of lectures (including "The Gradual Making of the Making of Americans," "Portraits and Repetition," "Poetry and Grammar," and "What is English Literature") that attempt to systematize and rationalize the literary choices made by Stein over the course of her career, and to contextualize them more generally within literary history. At the same time, these lectures do more than merely organize past thoughts: they reintegrate her work into a new progressivist narrative, a narrative at once about Stein's literary success and about the development of an American national consciousness. By linking these two narratives of development, Stein establishes a coherent vision of literary history and national identity that is both constitutive of and foundational to her own public importance. She thus connects publicity and civilization, moving readers into the twentieth century by finding ways to contextualize the shock of modernity and avant-garde representational strategies within existing cultural traditions and literary institutions. She manages to publicize her own work, winning acclaim while presenting herself as an exemplary modern re, a model for others seeking to integrate the shocks of modern publicity, representation, and production into existing patterns of daily life and collective habit.


<b></b>


<p>
These lectures, and in particular "What is English Literature," offer an interesting comparison to <i>Paris France</i>. As in <i>Paris France</i>, the story Stein tells also implies a parallel story&#x02014;the story of her own work, her own innovations, her own moment. The lectures, however, want to trace a context for, as opposed to a backdrop to, Stein's literary contribution. While <i>Paris France</i> seeks to explain the setting in which "the twentieth century" found its home, her lectures explicitly posit an alternative version of literary history&#x02014;in this case <i>English</i> literary history. They then offer prophecies of the future of literature, prophecies that inevitably locate that future in America and embody it in the re of Stein. As she says near the beginning of the lecture, "What is English literature, by English literature I mean American literature too."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein opens "What is English Literature" with what appears to be a tautology: "One cannot come back too often to the question what is knowledge and to the answer knowledge is what one knows" ("WIEL," 11). The rest of the essay will bear out the opening claim. Stein believes, literally, that "one cannot come back too often," or that repetition has a power and a value that this piece (like most of her work) will exemplify. Of course it is never mere mindless repetition she advocates, but rather iterations in the Derridean sense, whose nuances (and insistences) shift with their contexts and accumulate a range of meanings over time. The second paragraph, for instance, offers the title question of the essay&#x02014;not as a mere repetition but as an already-expanded, subtly modified, and ever-shifting amplification of the question:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What is English literature that is to say what do I know about it, that is to say what is it. What is English literature, by English literature I mean American literature too. 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Typically, Stein's gestures of clarification ("That is to say," "by English literature I mean . . . ") do as much to obscure or expand as they do to clarify or limit her question. Traditional logic is replaced by an internal logic of accumulation: English literature is "what . . . I know about it," and this is English literature. When she appears to be on the verge of offering a definition of "English literature," she veers into another area entirely: "by English literature I mean American literature too." This addition is a significant one for Stein's new genealogy of literary history, which, at the turning point of the twentieth century, leaps across the ocean from England to America. 

<p>
The logic of the essay is perhaps made most explicit in the following paragraph:



<blockquote class="extract">

Leaving aside the tantalizingly provocative claim that the history of English literature "could be told in a couple of sentences," this moment marries the stylistic features of the piece to Stein's larger arguments about national identity and literary history. For while Stein argues for English literature as a coherent, continuous narrative built over time through accumulated habits of daily behavior and civilization and culminating in her own work, the piece also argues, explicitly and through its formal structure, for the 


<b></b>


power and the importance of repetition, amplification, accumulation, duration&#x02014;for the necessity of making things "a great deal longer."

<p>
While "What is English Literature" links textual, syntactic, and rhetorical repetitions to literary history through its formal structures, its argument also takes up the question of how daily repetitions contribute to a national history. As Stein relates the history of the development of literature in England, she also importantly defines British culture as an island culture.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The island is a particularly notable image for Stein, representing a site where a single culture progresses based on its own habits of daily living. The insularity of "island living" is thus evocative of a continuity with past habits as well as an inaccessibility to other ways of life. 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The thing that has made the glory of English literature is description simple concentrated description not of what happened nor what is thought or what is dreamed but what exists and so makes the life the island life the daily island life. It is natural that an island life should be that. What could interest an island as much as the daily the completely daily island life. And in the descriptions the daily, the hourly descriptions of this island life as it exists and it does exist it does really exist English literature has gone on and on from Chaucer until now.

In the single paragraph from which this passage is quoted, Stein uses the word "description" four times, the word "daily" four times, the word "island" seven times, and the word "life" eight times. The effect is the recreation of the "daily island life" in which repeated actions accumulate to form the behaviors, preferences, and tendencies of a culture. That "description" res prominently in her vision of "daily island life" is significant as well, because it demonstrates the extent to which Stein sees writing as at once a daily practice, like making the bed or brushing your teeth, and as a mode through which the author participates discursively in the creation and the maintenance of a national culture.

<p>
In the story of development traced out by "What is English Literature," "daily island living," or living by the habits of the past, comes to be replaced by something new, represented by "American literature" and more particularly by Stein herself: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In England the daily island life was the daily life and it was solidly that daily life and they generally always simply relied on it. They relied on it so completely that they did not describe it they just had it and told it. Just like that. And then they had poetry, because everything was shut in there with them and these things birds beasts woods flowers, roses, violets and fishes were all there and as they were all there just telling that they were all there made poetry for any one. And there was a great deal of poetry for some five hundred years or more and there is a great deal of it. All this now has been everything.

<p class="blockquote">

In America as I was saying the daily everything was not the daily living and generally speaking there was not a daily everything. They do not live every day. And as they do not live every day they do not have the daily living and so they do not have this as something that they are telling.

This vision of America as a land without habit also partakes of a very recognizable mythology: America as a land unmoored from history and thus as more genuinely 


<b></b>


capable of recreating itself each day in the fresher air of the New World. Critics from Cornel West to Richard Poirier have celebrated what they see as the "Emersonian" and "pragmatic" elements of this view.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 

<p>
But the narrative of progress put forward here, what appears to be Stein's dismissal of "daily island living" as incapable of producing the literature of the twentieth century, should be read against competing claims elsewhere in her work. It should be read, for instance, against her claim in the <i>Autobiography</i> that "if you are way ahead with your head you naturally are old fashioned and regular in your daily life" (<i>AABT</i>, 75). Even the idea that the narrative of literary progress should end in America can be thrown into question with these final lines of the <i>Autobiography</i>: "About six weeks ago Gertrude Stein said, it does not look to me as if you were ever going to write that autobiography. You know what I am going to do, I am going to write it for you. I am going to write it as simply as Defoe did the autobiography of Robinson Crusoe. And she has and this is it." (<i>AABT</i>, 237)

<p>
This evocation of Crusoe, who had to recreate life anew on his island, to forge new habits taken from the past but shaped and molded to the new context in which he found himself, is at once a powerful tribute to habits of the past (including those represented by British literary history), and a celebration of those who are willing to create new habits and thus new ways of living in the present. Writing to Stein in 1936, Thornton Wilder offered the following enthusiastic adoption of Stein's most recent principles:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Oh, dear Gertrude, how right you are. Without tears I say it human nature is not interesting only Robinson Crusoe is interesting.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Human nature" here can be taken to mean mindless, habitual behaviors.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand, can be taken to represent a commitment to creating new habits better suited to a new world. It is thus the reinvention&#x02014;and not the rejection&#x02014;of "daily island living" that enables Stein to claim a position from which she can create the literature of the twentieth century. If the "daily island life" indicates a world in which "everything was shut in there with them," it is not much of a leap to imagine the lesbian m&#x000E9;nage of Toklas and Stein as one possibility for a newly responsive and modern recreation of "daily island living" with a difference&#x02014;a new set of habits, created in Dewey's words to be "more intelligent, more sensitively percipient, more informed with foresight, more aware of what they are about, more direct and sincere, more flexibly responsive than those now current" (<i>HNC</i>, 128). 

<p>
In creating&#x02014;and publicizing&#x02014;a "daily island life" of her own even as she develops a theory of "daily island living" and its links to literary history, Stein produces a vision of both national and individual identity linked to literary identity, one that is formed through daily exercises in writing, the rhythms of solitary work, and the public literary identity that comes from selling and justifying one's work in the marketplace. Instead of attempting to isolate either the purely textual movements of Stein's writings or the purely social discourses she produces, I want to argue that Stein's pragmatic modernism


<b></b>


makes it difficult to think one without the other. Her vision of social identities&#x02014;national, literary, sexual, class-based, and so forth&#x02014;inevitably takes shape through literary habits on the page and in practice, while her literary habits are always shaped by meditations on their place and effect within national and international public contexts.

Stein's work demonstrates the same complicated and dialectical treatment of habit that can be seen in James's and Dewey's philosophical examinations. Though she does not allow herself the conceptual escape-hatch of the oppositional stance, Stein remains profoundly aware of habit's mindless, deadening qualities. Indeed, her sophisticated understanding of the workings of habit renders her ambivalence towards its power all the more profound. As in James and Dewey, daily habits in Stein's work carry both conservative and transformative resonances, echoes of the past and visions of future actions. This ambivalence echoes throughout Stein's work, from <i>The Autobiography</i> to the following passage from "Poetry and Grammar":

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one's own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's description of commas in this passage recalls Dewey's description of "habit alone," which leads to "machine-like repetition, duplicating recurrence of old acts" (<i>HNC</i>, 126). Like habit, commas are a way of "replacing one's own interest," and the implications of their use are hardly negligible, for they "keep you from living your life as actively as you should lead it." While the passage offers an implicit treatment of philosophical or political habits of thought, it also uses metaphors of domestic life to signal the mindlessness and invisibility of grammatical habits. The rhythms of daily life and the daily practice of writing are placed in explicit relation, in this case by the transformation of the text into a sort of domestic environment.

<p>
Central to this textual/domestic habitat is the image of everyday household toil, an image reinforced by Stein's choice of the word "servile" to describe commas at the start of the passage. This scornful relegation of the comma to the role of the wife&#x02014;who, by "helping you along" helps "you" to ignore the daily functioning of your home so that you can consider weightier matters&#x02014;recalls Stein's alternating scorn and regard for the "daily island life" that enables truly creative work<i>.</i><sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> Toklas, banished to the boring and thankless task of entertaining Fernande Picasso almost from the start of <i>The Autobiography</i>, is also implicitly credited throughout that work, and throughout Stein's work more generally, with enabling Stein's genius. Stein's claim in <i>The Autobiography</i> that "if you are way ahead with your head you naturally are old fashioned 


<b></b>


and regular in your daily life" (<i>AABT</i>, 75) should be taken seriously. Stein is equally serious, however, when she associates being "old fashioned and regular in your daily life" with grammatical crutches like commas, literary ruts, and worst of all, with mindless habits of thought. This dialectical movement illuminates the paradox of habit described by Dewey and James.

<p>
Reading through this dialectic makes it clear that "living your life as actively as you should lead it" does not mean rejecting daily habits, as the historical avant-garde might have suggested. On the contrary, it means embracing those habits in a newly mindful way. Furthermore, Stein's discussion does not gesture toward a space free from habitual crutches. Indeed, the passage itself employs three commas, thus implying that, like habit, commas may be degrading, but they are also necessary to the forward movement of a text (as, by extension, habits are necessary to the smooth functioning of a home, or to the stability and power of a culture). Stein thus captures the ongoing tension between habitual behavior and thought as both enabling and deadening, as something to be warmly embraced but also vigorously resisted. 

<p>
In <i>Paris France</i>, habit represents at once the reassuring continuation of the past and the radical innovation of the future. The text traces Stein's ever-changing emphasis from the conservative to the transformative implications of habit. The question of habit is never resolved: it is both the necessary precondition for literary and political innovation and their potential downfall. The credo of <i>Paris France,</i> "Paris France is peaceful and exciting," itself embodies the conflict at the center of pragmatist habit. For Stein as for Dewey, awakening from habit is an ongoing process involving a sometimes painful fluctuation between habit itself (which is "peaceful") and shocks to habit (which are "exciting"). Further, the repetition of the phrase "Paris France is peaceful and exciting" performs a kind of rehabituation of the reader, who experiences the impermeability of Steinian "nonsense" even as she is invited into the Steinian logic of the text. As she moves through the book, the reader is habituated into a new set of reading practices, brought from alienation and estrangement to new habits of thought. In other words, the line embodies its own content, in the sense that the reader simultaneously experiences the "peaceful" lull of repetition and the "exciting" or invigorating work of avant-garde literary experiment. Taken together, this interplay between the "peaceful" and the "exciting" captures the very essence of the recontextualizing mode.

<p>
Daily repetitions and cultural traditions are important in the context of <i>Paris France</i> not just for their own sake, but because they create an environment in which innovations can take place:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
So it begins to be reasonable that the twentieth century whose mechanics, whose crimes, whose standardisation began in America, needed the background of Paris, the place where tradition was so firm that they could look modern without being different, and where their acceptance of reality is so great that they could let any one have the emotion of unreality. 


<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->

<div class="attribution">

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Movements of the future require a solid ground of "firm tradition" from which to launch their transformations. According to Stein, "anything one does every day is important and imposing" (<i>PF</i>, 18), precisely because it enables something beyond itself. In this case, the importance of Paris is that it enables "the emotion of unreality"&#x02014;the imagination of an unrealized (and possibly radical) future&#x02014;imported, along with "the twentieth century," from America. As in "What is English Literature," "America" is posited not only as the opposite of "tradition," but as the very wellspring of the twentieth century in the form of "mechanics" and "standardisation," terms that recall Stein's description of the cinema and "series production" in "Portraits and Repetition." 

<p>
But the complicating term in this passage is "crimes," hidden suggestively between "mechanics" and "standardisation." The word seems to suggest that "mechanics" and "standardisation" may be harbingers of the future, but they do not necessarily represent a triumphant overcoming of the civilization of the past:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
And so the French having invented nineteenth century warfare and then lost it, it was completed by the Americans in the civil war, they developed and fixed it as a thing definite and complete and the 1914-1918 war was as one might say just the end of the series. 
<!--_/extract-->

<p class="noIndent">
War as a form of "series production," or, more appropriately, "series destruction," is thus presented as one of America's contributions to the development of the "twentieth century." The suggestion that the Civil War offered a model for war as a newly standardized and mechanized activity calls up harrowing images of conveyor-belt casualties and deaths not far from the historical truth of the American Civil War and the war Stein claims is its legacy, World War I. With "crimes" included in her vision of "the twentieth century," modernity appears here as an ethically compromised development, hardly the radical future that breaks free from the stultifying past. Even the accompanying "standardisation" and "mechanisation" are thrown into a new light, and suddenly modernity signals habit's destructive consequences while the "firm tradition" of France offers an affirmative, "civilising" influence. Habit is everywhere in this description: neither savior nor villain, it enables and destroys in equal measure. Just as daily domestic habits are linked to national culture and "civilisation," the newly modernized habits of series production, standardization, and mechanization are linked to military conquest, national expansion, and the changing relation of Europe to America in the twentieth century. 

<p>
Recent criticisms of pragmatism tend to emphasize its limitations in accounting for the weight of the past, and, indeed, some contemporary incarnations of pragmatism call for a turn away from past and present political failures or divisions on the cultural left and towards a less "resentful" approach to the political present.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Stein's pragmatic modernism offers a different approach to the relation between past and future. As deployed by Stein, the pragmatist concept of habit not only respects the weight and power of the past, but actively demonstrates the dangers of ignoring that past. It shows that mindlessness is an equal danger in all habitual modes of thought, including those that orient themselves towards some imagined future. This delicate balance of pragmatist


<b></b>


habit, continually juggling respect for constructive habits of the past with skepticism for any and all mindless practices, reaches into every sphere. It suggests the relationship of mutual interdependence between the domestic and the national and insists that the "weightier matters" of philosophical thought and literary experimentation flourish in the rich soil of daily life.

<p>
Stein's complicated approach to the habits of "daily island living" can be felt throughout <i>Paris France</i>, where the civilization of France and the innovations of the twentieth century are only useful and interesting when juxtaposed. The title <i>Paris France</i> embodies the centrality of this sort of juxtaposition within the text, acting as the crowning example of the "peaceful and exciting" dialectic explored throughout the book. Though the phrase may appear at first as a clich&#x000E9;, or as a synecdoche for a known quantity, it comes alive with the opposing energies of past and future, of habit and modernity, of Paris and France. Paris, signifying a site of international cosmopolitan sophistication, takes on a newly modern charge in relation to France, a nation-state with a history stretching backwards into the past. What further enables this dialectical push and pull is the elimination of the "servile" comma that works against active and fully contradictory living. Free of the comma, the phrase opens itself up to a dialectic of habit which also functions as a Benjaminian engagement with history. As in the Baudelaire essay, "modernity" in <i>Paris France</i> is meaningless as a concept abstracted from historical conflict and specificity. To understand "the twentieth century," Stein might say, it is necessary to understand the deep and variegated strata of habits that have brought us to our moment. 

<p>
Stein's pragmatic modernism should be valued for what previous discussions of modernism have too often disdained: for its commitment to managing and redirecting the energies of historically specific shock, its awareness of its own institutional embeddedness, and its skepticism about the inherent usefulness of violent disruptions of convention. To study the tradition of pragmatic modernism, as illustrated by the work of Stein, is to put modernism into its social and institutional contexts. While Stein's work does not share Benjamin's explicit commitment to leftist social transformation, it joins with Benjamin to suggest the possibility of an alternative model of critique, one that can also be recognized in the work of novelists like Henry James or Marcel Proust, or of such thinkers as William James, John Dewey, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. As developed by Stein, habit offers an unrooted, antiessentialist dialectic whose oscillations require neither undue empirical confidence nor metaphysical teleology and whose implications for social and literary criticism are thus all the more potent. Stein's work offers us a glimpse of an alternative tradition in modernism, and it points the way toward a new possibility within contemporary academic discourse: that of the recontextualizing mode of criticism.

Connections between pragmatism and Bergsonism have often been invited by the biographical fact that James and Bergson met several times, shared a correspondence, and read each other's work with great sympathy and interest. Ralph Barton Perry devotes several chapters to the relationship in his <i>The Thought and Character of William James</i> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1935).

Reading Stein through pragmatist habit also helps to break down common dichotomies in the categorizations of Stein's work, such as the division between her "accessible" and "experimental" styles. It is in this vein that I focus primarily on <i>PF</i> in this article. With the important exception of a recently published essay by John Whittier-Ferguson, "The Liberation of Gertrude Stein: War and Writing," ( 8.3 [2001]: 405-28) surprisingly few critics have offered sustained readings of <i>Paris France</i>. Those who do so often use the text as though it were a transparent memoir. Shari Benstock, for example, uses <i>PF</i> as an informational "source" in her <i>Women of the Left Bank</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986). Equally surprising are reports of the book being shelved in the "travel" section of bookstores. Putting this text in the context of pragmatic modernism will, I hope, reveal not only its textual experimentalism and richness but its continuity with Stein's more commonly revered "Master-Pieces."

Stein criticism over the years has made much of this topic, most frequently in order to argue in favor of Stein's interest in the disjunctive, the extra-linguistic, or the technological. See Wendy Steiner's introduction to <i>Lectures in America</i> (1935; rpt. Boston: Virago, 1988), and Susan McCabe, "'Delight in Dislocation': The Cinematic Modernism of Stein, Chaplin, and Man Ray,"  8.3 : 429-53.

It is in the context of her discussion of cinema that Stein famously makes the distinction between "repetition" and "insistence," in a highly amusing defense of her most commonly parodied and misunderstood textual innovation: "Then also there is the important question of repetition and is there any such thing. Is there repetition or is there insistence. I am inclined to believe that there is no such thing as repetition. And really how can there be . . . every time one of the hundreds of times a newspaper man makes fun of my writing and of my repetition he always has the same theme, always having the same theme, that is, if you like, repetition, that is if you like the repeating that is the same thing, but once started expressing this thing, expressing any thing there can be no repetition because the essence of that expression is insistence, and if you insist you must each time use emphasis and if you use emphasis it is not possible while anybody is alive that they should use exactly the same emphasis.


<b></b>


And so let us think seriously of the difference between repetition and insistence." (Stein, "Portraits and Repetition," 166-7.)

Stein's most important extended discussion of "human nature" and its adverse, "the human mind," takes place, appropriately enough, in <i>The Geographical History of America or The Relation of Human Nature to the Human Mind</i> (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973). Critics have read this discussion as concerning a wide variety of philosophical problems; in addition, they have read <i>The Geographical History of America</i> as "the central text in any consideration of Stein's relations to American literary tradition" (Marianne DeKoven, "Half in and Half Out of Doors: Gertrude Stein and Literary Tradition," in <i>A Gertrude Stein Companion</i>, ed. Bruce Kellner [Westport, CT: 1988], 75). Most readings of the text connect "human nature" and "the human mind" to abstract philosophical concepts such as "identity" and "self." DeKoven links the terms to an Emersonian tradition, arguing that "a great deal of the book is in fact a serious, sustained idealist meditation on the difference between transcendence, or the human mind, and immanence, or human nature" . I prefer to read "human nature" as ingrained and thoughtless behaviors or social habits, and "the human mind" as Dewey's "conscious search," signaling a variety of possibilities, from literary and intellectual history to the critical stance of pragmatic questioning. This reading offers an understanding of 


<b></b>


the relation of human nature to the human mind that grounds such abstract philosophical issues as "transcendence," "immanence," and "master-pieces" within the dialectic of habit.

Stein's disdain for the servile commas also recalls the dominant mythology of Stein's relations with Alice B. Toklas, and interestingly suggests the daily habits that characterized the "daily island living" of the Stein/Toklas m&#x000E9;nage. Catharine Stimpson has claimed that "the marriage was Victorian," pointing out that "(n)ot only did Stein write, and Toklas type and edit, but Stein ate, and Toklas cooked and served" (Catharine R. Stimpson, "Gertrice/Altrude: Stein, Toklas, and the Paradox of the Happy Marriage," in <i>Mothering the Mind</i>, eds. Ruth Perry and Martine Watson Brownley [New York: Holmes and Meier, 1984], 130). Toklas's hyper-traditional wifely role was emphasized time and again by both Stein and Toklas and is central to <i>AABT</i>, in which Stein has Toklas introduce herself as follows: "I am a pretty good housekeeper and a pretty good gardener and a pretty good needlewoman and a pretty good secretary and a pretty good editor and a pretty good vet for dogs and I have to do them all at once and I found it difficult to add being a pretty good author." (<i>AABT</i>, 237) Even the famous Stein/Toklas Saturday evening salons were divided neatly by "gender roles;" Stein sat with the "geniuses," and Toklas sat with "the wives of geniuses": "Before I decided to write this book my twenty-five years with Gertrude Stein, I had often said that I would write, The wives of geniuses I have sat with. I have sat with so many. I have sat with wives who were not wives, with geniuses who were real geniuses. I have sat with real wives of geniuses who were not real geniuses. I have sat with wives of geniuses, of near geniuses, of would be geniuses, in short I have sat very often and very long with many wives and wives of many geniuses" (<i>AABT</i>, 13).

Gertrude Stein returned to the United States in 1934, a year of fierce debate over the Federal Communications Act and the regulation of American radio. As she explored the nation that res so prominently in her writings, she could not have missed the fact that radio broadcasting had captured the imaginations of Americans. Stein had long been an avid reader and critic of popular culture and the media&#x02014;her relationship with American newspapers predated her late romance with the radio. However, the influence of mass-media forms upon her writing has yet to be fully explored. In what follows I will demonstrate that radio in particular acted as a powerful formal model for Stein's late writing.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 

<p>
Radio's influence can be traced in Stein's political and aesthetic strategies during her American tour, and it emerges as a dominant note in her World War II texts.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Broadcasting provides a suggestive means of connecting Stein's early aural experimentalism (as in the multiple, echoing voices of "Bon Marche Weather") with her later, more popular, idiom. Resolutely oral, dialogic, and changeable, Stein's artistic project finally finds its formal corollary in mid-century radio. Tracing the influence of the radio in Stein's late writing also makes it possible to extend our analysis of Stein's use of indeterminacy in language to her more audience-focused texts, with the effect of complicating our readings of her investment in communication and communal meaning-making. Through the 1930s and 1940s, Stein wrestles with the idea of radio as a kind of public sphere&#x02014;a forum in which self, other, and community can be constituted through talk. Her aurality must thus be understood as being as profoundly public in its orientations as it is private.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Finally, hearing the radio in Stein's late writing advances our understanding of the 


<b></b>


cross-fertilizations of "high" and "low" modernist cultures, while beginning to acknowledge radio's own distinct thematic and stylistic contributions to mid-century modernism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein was not alone in responding powerfully to radio. By the time Stein returned to the United States for her lecture tour of the mid-1930s, radio had been the subject of a powerful discourse of technological utopianism for more than a decade.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Radio had promised, according to its very earliest boosters, to bring together the geographically and culturally scattered nation. Respected thinkers such as John Dewey, Herbert Cooley, and Robert Park believed that radio offered the means to create a new public united by channels of communication.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In an extreme version of such claims, the League of Political Education asserted (somewhat ominously) in 1938 that the broadening "psychological gaps" between Americans could be overcome through the radio, which fostered a "simultaneous process of thinking."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's "Fireside Chats" were just one way in which radio was used to call a national community into being. As Lizabeth Cohen has shown in her study of Depression-era workers in Chicago, the claims of radio boosters were not spurious: by facilitating alliances between disparate ethnic groups during the 1930s, radio helped to bring about a self-conscious community of American working people.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Broadcasting seemed to be unstoppable in its promotion of social connection. 

<p>
Why would Stein respond to such a potentially overbearing program of social connection? By the mid-1930s she had become more aware of social connection as an intellectual problem. As she explains in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> , <i>The Making of Americans</i>  was an effort to write a history of "every individual person" and the relations between those individuals. However, Stein claims that in the 1930s "individual anything as related to every other individual" is no longer interesting:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
now since the earth is all covered over with every one there is really no relation between any one and so if this Everybody's Autobiography is to be the autobiography of every one it is not to be of any connection between any one and any one because now there is none.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Mass society has led to anything but mass culture, if we are to believe that no relations exist for <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> to map. However, Stein's insistence on "everybody" and "every one" asserts the continuing power of the language of the social. Her texts of the 1930s will turn away from relations between "any one and any one" to explore new mass forms of connection.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 

<p>
As Stein writes in "I Came and Here I Am," published in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> in February 1936, American radio suggests a new form that enables her to extend the explorations of her earlier texts:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In writing in <i>The Making of Americans</i> I said I write for myself and strangers and this is what broadcasting is. I write for myself and strangers. . . . I had never heard a broadcasting; that is I had never listened to one and I certainly had never thought of doing one, and this is the way the thing that I like best of all the things I have never done before, was done . . . we sat down one on either side of the little thing that was between us and I said something and they said that is all, and then suddenly it was all going on. It was it was 


<b></b>


really all going on, and it was, it really was, as if you were saying what you were saying and you knew, you really knew, not by what you knew but by what you felt, that everybody was listening. It is a very wonderful thing to do, I almost stopped and said it, I was so filled with it. And then it was over and I never had liked anything as I had liked it.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Broadcasting fills Stein with the feeling of everybody&#x02014;of everybody listening. Radio creates the everybody by creating the audience, a kind of community that understands itself as existing in (varying) relation to a mass medium.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  However, this audience is not passive, nor is the broadcast unidirectional; as Stein's voice fills the airwaves she in turn is filled by listening. The radio broadcast conveys a sense of an immediate and concentrated present; it begins again and again, as Stein's characteristically insistent phrasings indicate to us. It applies itself to representational questions that Stein's writing had been addressing for the three preceding decades. As she proclaims to the readership of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, Stein is smitten with the distinct form of connection that the radio seems capable of performing.

<p>
The <i>Cosmopolitan</i> article represents the enjoyment of broadcasting as constituted by a distinct kind of knowledge, knowing "by what you felt." That is, the appeal of the radio is not exclusively informational, but extends intellectually, just as it does physically, into more intimate and emotional territory. Stein's experience of the America of radio evangelist Father Coughlin would have made this extension clear. The emotional appeals of the radio form would achieve dominance in the United States by the late 1930s and early 1940s, when the threat of war made strongly-felt connection and communication across the geographic and cultural divides of the United States seem even more imperative. As the American war machine engaged, pundits assigned the radio a central role in the creation and maintenance of "national morale." Radio assumed this central role by dint of its distinctive form of address, according to James Rowland Angell of NBC. He attributed the medium's influence to: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
 the immediacy of its conveyance of news;  the vast mass of persons thus reached, many of them having only delayed access, if any, to the newspapers, and not a few being unused to reading, or incapable of it;  <i>the psychological appeal of the living human voice as contrasted with cold type</i>&#x02014;even when accompanied with the barrage of photographs now so universally employed by the press 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(my emphasis).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Stein's writing of this period also explores radio's distinctive formal command over the emotions. In <i>Ida</i> , after having drifted without affect through a series of spaces, occupations, and husbands, Ida hears the national anthem on the radio and cries.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In this scene, the radio's appeal is so immediate that it results in a disproportionate response. Ironically, the "living voice" reproduced by the radio has greater access to and effect upon Ida than do most of the truly living voices around her. Ida is a guarded public re, but this medium penetrates her reserve. While the content conveyed by the radio in this case is clearly public and nationalistic, its form grants it a level of access unparalleled in its intimacy. Accordingly, this medium generates private feeling and directs it into public channels. It recouples the emotional and intellectual responses to truth, and in the process, redefines truth.


<b></b>


<p>
When it operates in this way, the radio formalizes a response to expression that Stein considered essential to the understanding of her work. In a 1937 radio interview, Stein explains that the reader accesses what her writing is about when he or she responds to it with enjoyment: "The reader does know [what Stein is thinking about] because he enjoys it. If you enjoy you understand if you understand you enjoy. What you mean by understanding is being able to turn it into other words but that is not necessary."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Stein here distinguishes the interviewer's translation-as-understanding from her own response-as-understanding. Response does not entail a re-transcription, but is a creative act. Stein's version of understanding extends beyond intellectual engagement with the linguistic. It puts the reader in a less passive position by requiring his or her emotional participation in a communal creation of the meaning of the material.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 

<p>
Participation of this sort was increasingly expected from radio audiences in the 1930s. One of Stein's longtime correspondents, the "Kiddie" (William G. Rogers, a doughboy from World War I) described in a letter to her the natural impulse to respond that he experienced while listening, in a lunch room, to one of her radio broadcasts: "we heard you very plainly for a couple of minutes and I wanted to interrupt and say hello," he confided.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Much of the correspondence that FDR received from Depression-era Americans was in response to the intimate "conversations" started in his "Fireside Chats." Quiz shows such as <i>Vox Pop</i> demanded the participation of the audience in answering questions on the broadcast and in suggesting questions by correspondence. Another booming segment of the radio market was devoted to discussion shows, including the extremely popular <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, which aired weekly on NBC from mid-1935. Stein left the United States before <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> began broadcasting, but she would sample its cultural effects on the GIs whom she encountered at the end of World War II. Her extended relationship with the University of Chicago academic community (chronicled in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> and represented by the lectures collected in <i>Narration</i>) makes it likely that she was also familiar with another successful radio discussion program that ran weekly on NBC from 1933, the <i>University of Chicago Round Table</i>. Indeed, the discussions that Stein describes (in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>) having at the University of Chicago suggest that she was casting her very own University of Chicago round table. 

<p>
The discussion programs of the 1930s (both major radio networks, NBC and CBS, ran several) were particularly provocative in their approach to audience participation. Not unlike Stein's writing, these programs attempted to reorient audience enjoyment away from the certainty of conventional knowing. Surprisingly, the marketing strategies of the major discussion programs trumpeted their cultivation of intellectual complication, something that we more easily associate with Stein's avant-gardism.


<h3 class="aHead">

America's Town Meeting of the Air
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>


<p>
George Denny, the founder of the popular <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, claimed to have conceived the show out of dissatisfaction with a neighbor who "would rather be shot than caught listening to Roosevelt on the radio," who "just won't listen. 


<b></b>


Even with the radio right there in his room and a chance to hear what the other side has to say for itself, he deliberately closes his mind."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  According to Denny, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> was meant to access the energy the neighbor put into seeking out familiar perspectives, and shift it outward. The program intended to market difference of opinion to the nation, and it employed the unique access of radio to do so. It traveled around the country recording its broadcasts, in order to ensure diverse representation. An episode consisted of a series of advocates addressing a central topic from their different perspectives (the first broadcast, May 30, 1935, heard from proponents of fascism, communism, socialism, and democracy in response to the question "Which Way America?"), followed by questions and responses from the audience. 

<p>
The incorporation of the audience into the discussion form was particularly effective at troubling the division between performance and audience and at undermining the notion that the masses passively consumed mediated content. Harry and Bonaro Overstreet's book-length study of the program, <i>Town Meeting Comes to Town</i> , celebrates Denny's radio program as the ultimate exploration of the radio's capacity in this endeavor. According to the Overstreets, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> was designed to put the emotional immediacy and intimate access of the radio to the service of public discussion; it would circumvent audience leanings toward the familiar and comfortable and insist upon multiple, irresolvable perspectives. That is, according to the Overstreets, <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> represented a kind of participatory radio that recouples emotional and intellectual engagement, just as Stein's writing does.

<p>
Indeed, most of those involved with the program seemed to consider the volume of mail generated by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> a critical indicator of its success. George Denny proudly asserted that the very first broadcast "brought in a flood of three thousand letters."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Franklin Dunham of NBC cited with pride the 100,000 letters that NBC received for <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> in 1937.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Jeanette Sayre, research assistant to the Princeton Radio Research Project and the <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i>, published one of the first academic studies of radio fan-mail analysis.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Overstreets' study goes further and cites extensively from the correspondence received by the program. Responses from schoolteachers and ex-soldiers, city-dwellers and residents of remote rural areas, stretch over numerous pages of their book. The use of quotation in <i>Town Meeting Comes to Town</i> extends beyond the presentation of evidence. Instead, the Overstreets seem to imply that the program's inclusiveness of a diversity of voices is a formal approach that breeds such inclusiveness in those who come into contact with it. They are no longer satisfied with referencing other voices; instead, they must hear them and allow them to be heard.

<p>
According to George Denny, the "audience-participation angle" was what was new and exciting about <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>. Indeed, in his writing about the program, description of its audience-participation shifts seamlessly to a discussion of the discussion groups spawned by the program, in which the audience-participation angle is far extended:


<b></b>


<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
From the first this program began to elicit mail telling of listening groups that had been formed in schools, colleges, churches, clubs, and by all kinds of organizations. One group met on Thursday nights in the back of a drugstore in Provincetown, Massachusetts; others met in the homes of neighbors and friends. Interest extended to Canada, where a group of trappers met each week in far-off Engen, British Columbia. . . . There are now more than a thousand groups registered with Town Hall, but according to an estimate made by Frank E. Hill, field representative of the American Association for Adult Education, there are more than three thousand groups of various sizes which meet regularly and listen to the Town Meeting of the Air on Thursday nights and continue their discussion afterward.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Audience" as conceived by this program and its proponents was a role that involved active commitment and engagement without a clear conclusion. The program acted as a formal model that could then be adapted and redeployed on a continuing basis in a multitude of settings.

<p>
According to these writers, radio was negotiating a new kind of public sphere, one constantly spinning off unpredictable micro-versions. The idea of a public sphere was important to Stein, especially in the 1930s and 1940s; it res in her depiction of salon culture in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and her discussions of "publicity" in her post-American-tour writings. During the 1930s, radio seemed to promise to serve as an aural version of the "face-to-face communities" that John Dewey looked to in <i>The Public and Its Problems</i> for the reinvigoration of twentieth century participatory democracy.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
According to Nancy Fraser, some version of Habermas's public sphere and the public constituted through it remains critical to ideas of democracy. However, as Fraser makes clear, the public sphere as traditionally conceptualized is inadequately attuned to social inequality; her theorization of "subaltern counterpublics" suggests that "participatory parity" is more likely to be achieved in the context of a plurality of publics.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Radio, especially as it became dominated by networks in the 1930s, has understandably been seen as presupposing the inadequately flexible, homogeneous public sphere that Fraser, among others, critiques. What remains underexplored is the degree to which radio of the 1930s was aware of these deficiencies and attempted to address them. All of the marketing noise generated by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> does suggest that at least an appearance of mobility among the diverse and heterogeneous publics making up the United States of the 1930s was in the program's commercial interests. 

<p>
In fact, the understanding of the cultural work done by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> put forward by the Overstreets is not unlike the understanding of the cultural work done by late-twentieth-century TV talk shows recently put forward by the Mass Media Group of the Committee for Cultural Studies at the City University of New York. According to this group, late-twentieth-century TV talk shows "constitute a 'contested space' in which new discursive practices are developed in contrast to the traditional modes of political and ideological representation."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Recent TV talk shows, according to the Mass Media Group, are constructed around the audience and its response 


<b></b>


to a central topic; they are radically inconclusive; their approach is therapeutic rather than cognitive. In their quest for a lively exchange, they become a site for the circulation of alternative discursive practices. Of course, radio programs such as <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> hewed more faithfully to the traditional debate format than does Sally Jesse Raphael. However, the discourse surrounding the radio program suggests that it considered the cognitive and the therapeutic approaches to be inextricable; <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> was therapy for American democracy. Certainly, <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> was inconclusive and considered the audience the primary player in its dramas. As such, it must be understood as attempting an early version of a mass-media "contested space" public sphere.

<p>
In a radio broadcast made at Lyon in 1945, based on her experience of wartime Europe, Stein asserted the importance of the radio in bringing different voices together: "Ecoutez le radio. On ne pouvez pas imaginer d'entendre parler au radio l'esperanto. Non c'est ce qu'il nous interesse au radio c'est la multiplicite des langues. que chacqu'un cree d'une facon vibrante en son propre langue [sic]."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Broadcasters of the 1930s and 1940s were also insistent that American radio was fundamentally democratic in its aims and its techniques. In a <i>Public Opinion Quarterly</i> special supplement on "Public Opinion in a Democracy," published in 1938, spokesmen for both major American networks underlined their networks' commitment to the representation of a diversity of opinion. NBC's Franklin Dunham wrote that "Radio honestly strives to present not only two points of view on any subject brought to its forums, but as many points of view as there are, or at least as can be made articulate" ("DR," 77). His equivalent at CBS, Sterling Fisher, similarly insisted that "In general, it is the policy of the radio to present as many important and varied views as possible."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The networks were anxious to present the radio as adaptable to an unlimited range of audiences, modernistically adopting and discarding forms and discourses from hour to hour. 

<p>
Of course, as many thinkers of the period pointed out, the pronouncements of network representatives are an inadequate basis for a judgment of the medium's performance in the 1930s. Thomas H. Reed, a prominent scholar of government and member of the National Municipal League, believed that the commercial motives of major networks precluded effective education, civic or otherwise, on their parts.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As radio scholars have recently shown, ethnic and racial diversity was increasingly squeezed off the airwaves with the expansion of network control in the 1930s (<i>RV</i>, 1-33, 75-96).<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  And yet the insistence of contemporary rhetoric upon the diversity represented on the radio remains an important and intriguing key to understanding the role of radio in the 1930s and 1940s. Regardless of the accuracy of the networks' claims for diversity, the idea of diversity clearly remained of great value to them.

<p>
Even Stein may have recognized the split between the theory of diversity on the American airwaves and its reality. In fact, by the 1940s she was listening to American propaganda in occupied France, and diversity was clearly only one of radio's many claims whose correspondence with reality were questionable. Stein probably appreciated the radio's failure to restrict its claims to demonstrable realities. The strain of aurality in her work had always been that which most resisted realistic reading. (Indeed,


<b></b>


the very degree to which aurality seems to resist theorization even today would, for Stein, seem immensely exciting.) For her, the formal and representational possibilities of radio arose from the fact that the medium was less tethered to straightforward realism (and thus possibly more open to alternate "realities") than were other popular media. 

<p>
Photography, for example, seemed to demand faithful reproduction of a kind not expected in radio. In <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>, Stein ironically recounts a photographic session in the United States. Resisting miscasting by the photographer, she insists on only adopting poses of activities she actually performs:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Alright I said what do you want me to do. Why he said there is your airplane bag suppose you unpack it, oh I said Miss Toklas always does that oh no I could not do that, well he said there is the telephone suppose you telephone well I said yes but I never do Miss Toklas always does that, well he said what can you do, well I said I can put my hat on and take it off and I can put my coat on and I can take it off and I like water I can drink a glass of water . . .

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's comical insistence reflects the realistic representational agenda she has assigned to the photographic medium. 

<p>
On the radio, however, in conversations both scripted and improvisational, much as her ever-changing lectures were, Stein mounted a far more playful performance. Her radio talk is more continuous with the experimentation with voice that characterizes <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> . At the end of <i>Alice B. Toklas</i>, Stein's and Toklas's voices uncannily interpenetrate, suggesting a far greater flexibility of identities than do the strictly demarcated roles available to Stein in photographs. Radio's aurality appears to enable it to resist the American desire "to make everything something anybody can see by looking" (<i>EA</i>,168). The self mediated by radio is not something anybody can see by looking&#x02014;it is a supple and ever-changing performance. The "face-to-face" community enabled by the radio is rather an "ear-to-mouth-to-ear-to-mouth" one&#x02014;more complex and chaotic and more formally and intellectually promising.

The influence of the form of radio upon Stein's work is felt nowhere more powerfully than in her last major work, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> . <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> is constructed as a series of conversations between GIs. However, it is not one of Stein's plays&#x02014;that is, it is a vocal performance that is not meant to be embodied. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> takes up Stein's preoccupation with the capacity of voice to mediate social connection. In <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> Stein assumed a down-home, intimate voice that would have broad appeal and thus engineer far-reaching social connection. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> goes beyond the salon setting of <i>Alice B. Toklas</i> to represent a rootless public <i>performance</i> of connection. The performance of connection in <i>Brewsie</i> 


<b></b>


<i>and Willie</i> is multiple, in multiple senses: it involves many voices; it involves conflicting interpretations; it involves multiple occurrences (a late version of Stein's "beginning again and again"). That is, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> resembles a form popularized by <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>. 

<p>
<i>Brewsie and Willie</i> is itself a cultural study, taking its form from the differences that Stein observed between the GIs of 1944 and the doughboys of 1918. In <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> , Stein explains the difference between the two American armies as one verbal performance. The doughboys would drink silently or tell stories. The American army of 1944 "conversed, it talked it listened, and each one of them had something to say."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The American turn to talk that Stein celebrates in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> cannot be exclusively attributed to the influence of radio. However, the radio is suggested by the GIs as a possible source of their new talkativeness: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
they all agreed that the depression had a lot to do with it, it made people stay at home because they had no money to go out with, all the same said some of them that military service that they did before we came into the war had something to do with it, it kind of sobered everybody up, kind of made them feel what it was to get ready. Some of them said the radio had a lot to do with it, they got the habit of listening to information, and then the quizzes that the radio used to give kind of made them feel that it was no use just being ignorant, and then some of them said crossword puzzles had a lot to do with it.

<p class="noIndent">
The GIs' attempt to explain their conversational style in <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> presents the radio as both a source of information and (through the quiz show) a site of questioning. These GIs questioned by Stein explain their own capacity for conversation at least in part by recourse to their radio listening skills&#x02014;in this they follow Franklin Dunham of NBC's description of the role of the audience as to "'respond' or listen," which equates the two acts ("DR," 77). Brewsie, the main GI conversationalist of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, makes this same equation: "Listen, said Brewsie, listen to me. I want to know why do you fellows feel the way you do."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Their listening will necessarily entail their response to him. Conversation is not all voice&#x02014;in fact, radio seems to suggest, talking and listening are inextricable, parts of the same role. Of course, to assign full responsibility for this style of reasoning to the radio would be to diminish the historical importance of a dialogic ethos of response, balance, and discussion, in which no position is static or explicable, but all positions require constant re-exploration. However, it was clear to Stein in the 1940s that radio listenership had had surprisingly positive intellectual effects on the GIs.

<p>
What <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> suggests is that the formal implications of the radio discussion format extend far beyond the implications of its content. The rhetoric of diversity marshaled by the networks in the 1930s and even more ferociously during the war years shows its effects in the particular conversational style that Stein finds at work in the GIs:


<b></b>


<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The last American army used to ask questions, why do the French people put walls around their houses what are they afraid of what do they want to hide. Why do they want to stay and work this ground when there is so much better land to find. This army does not ask questions like that, they consider that people have their habits and their ways of living, some you can get along with and others you can't, but they are all perfectly reasonable for the people who use them. That is the great change in the Americans, they are interested, they are observant, they are accustomed to various types of people and ways of being, they have plenty of curiosity, but not any criticism, that is the new army. It was all very exciting.

<p class="noIndent">
In other words, the point is not simply that the GIs talk, but that they assign a certain performative value to talk. No longer can conversation gain them answers or explain away the peculiarities of a different culture. In this new conversational format, talk continually constitutes and reconstitutes differences; it multiplies ways of being, extending diversity rather than controlling it. This public sphere is not one of consensus but rather one of constant interaction between positions of difference.

<p>
<i>Brewsie and Willie</i> takes the form of a broadcast of this exciting GI talk. The talk's centrality to the text is conveyed through the lack of quotation marks, which indicates Stein's unwillingness to appear to be formally bounding this talk. The novel consists of a series of conversations among American GIs and nurses. Brewsie, a thoughtful GI, and Willie, his more gruff sidekick, are heard in most of the scenes, but not in all of them. The conversations do circle uneasily around a central topic (the nature of a postwar U.S.), but they approach this topic from a myriad of different perspectives and never succeed in resolving anything. If anything, the talk confuses the participants further; as Willie reminds Brewsie, "you just keep on thinking and talking the more foggy you feel" (<i>BW</i>, 719).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  As far as Brewsie is concerned, all of this talking is "how to get going away from what everybody has gotten the habit of thinking is the only way to do, kind of swinging a big truck around, said Jo, and making it come around a corner. No, said Brewsie, not that, but to find the way that looks the same and is different or find the way that looks different and is the same" (<i>BW</i>, 753). Brewsie's conversational agenda is difficult to distinguish from Stein's modernist one. However, the radio-popularized discussion format enables the detachment of this agenda from solitary "genius" res. The end of chapter twelve finds all of the conversation participants suddenly looking around for the missing Brewsie, which suggests their capacity to detach the form from the agent from whom they first learned it.

<p>
The conversations of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> re as moments of community-forming discussion and contemplation, scheduled "Not every day, said Jo./ Mostly every day, said Willie," or with just enough regularity to be dependable without being predictable (<i>BW</i>, 726). Two nurses who discover the sessions in the third chapter return in most subsequent chapters; by the end, they are important contributors to the conversation and have introduced many of their friends to the forum. Like the radio parties that broadcasters were encouraging in the contemporary U.S., these GI conversations powerfully enact the discursive construction of community. And yet they do not require agreement for the construction of community. Indeed, as Brewsie suggests, the 


<b></b>


conversations offer a way out of a dissatisfying community predicated on agreement: "I think we are sad because we have different feelings but we articulate all the same" (<i>BW</i>, 772). The relationships instantiated by the discussion format both arise from and further enable different articulations.

<p>
As the conversations of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> begin again and again, the GIs and nurses together seem to move towards "Not an answer but a way to go on" in a culture of jobs and job-mindedness, consumption and the installment plan (<i>BW</i>, 749). The way to go on, of course, is not to be found in Brewsie's social or economic theories, his evocation of the American pioneer spirit, or any of the other answers he fumbles towards. However, Brewsie's insistence on the possibility of an answer is precisely the energy that keeps the conversations going and keeps the participants interested and interesting. It is not simply the process of discussion that Stein values in this text, but also the na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9; that keeps conversation vital. It is this "innocence" that Stein elsewhere labeled the "new hope" of the WWII generation.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Brewsie's engagement, his creative willingness to produce interpretation and misinterpretation, keeps him and his peers from becoming the kinds of passive consumers that Adorno and the Frankfurt School theorists feared they would be. Much as we may agree with Willie that "there aint any answer," we also see that simply accepting that knowledge would rule out all but passive consumption (<i>BW</i>, 730). The conversational project must be sustained&#x02014;it is a value in and of itself&#x02014;and Willie's knowingness cannot sustain it. 

<p>
Brewsie and Willie's series of conversations ends on the uncertain note of redeployment, in an exchange that suggests the degree to which this radio-mediated conversational ethos has yet to take root in American culture:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
tell me, said Janet, wont you miss talking when you get home, you do know dont you all of you nobody talks like you boys were always talking, not back home. Yes we know, said Jo. Yes we know, said Jimmie. Not Brewsie, said Willie, he'll talk but, said Willie, Brewsie will talk but we wont be there to listen, we kind of will remember that he's talking somewhere but we wont be there to listen, there wont be anybody talking where we will be. But, said Jo, perhaps they will talk now, why you all so sure they wont talk over there, perhaps they will talk over there. Not those on the job they wont, said Willie, not those on the job.

<p class="noIndent">
The body of the text ends on this note of insecurity, Jo's hope for a newly conversational nation met by Willie's gruff disbelief. And yet even the cynic Willie does not entirely abandon the fantasy of a discursively constructed community&#x02014;he simply locates it in the spaces of leisure, away from the job. Not job-mindedness but entertainment will preserve this form and keep Americans talking to each other. Radio did seem optimally positioned to facilitate the new leisure culture, and in leisure Stein finds a space for endangered talk.

<p>
Stein's epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, addressed"To Americans" and written in the first person, takes up the anxieties expressed by the GIs about their return home. According to her, the postwar era is critical to the definition of the nation; if the United States is not to "go poor," it must stop pursuing conventional solutions to its problems 


<b></b>


and devise something truly new. In order to achieve this, according to Stein, "you have to really learn to express complication . . . . Remember the depression, don't be afraid to look it in the face and find out the reason why . . . . Look facts in the face, not just what they all say, the leaders, but every darn one of you" (<i>BW</i>, 778). Stein's epilogue itself enters into a kind of conversation, speaking back to both her text and her readers while remaining formally distinct from both. If <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> adopts the form of the radio, broadcasting conversation, then Stein's epilogue reminds us that listening cannot be passive. The self, even for the participant "outside" the boundaries of the form, must understand herself as implicated and involved in the negotiations of the form.

It is all very well to note Stein speaking from outside the formal boundaries of an established conversation, but we must keep in mind the license granted by her status as a cultural icon in the 1930s and 1940s. Her epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> has the distinct flavor of the Rooseveltian fireside chat. Other res remain more fully outside the formal boundaries of <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, the radio, and the nation as imagined community, and their participation helps to construct the limits of the radio-mediated public sphere. Most obvious among these outsider res is the African American. African Americans do not have speaking parts in the conversations that make up <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>; their words, when they appear, are quoted by white participants in the conversations. Although they re repeatedly in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, African American soldiers are noticeably excluded from the expressive form being explored by the text.

<p>
The position of African Americans in both <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> and American wartime radio reinforces the importance of attending to the <i>form</i> of expressive programs. As content, African American culture and questions of race were not considered outside the purview of radio. A large part of radio's success could be attributed to its popular jazz programming throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The first, triumphantly popular, radio serial was <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i>, a blackface comedy that planted race squarely at the center of the topics engaged by radio programming.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  By the 1940s, the American "race problem" had finally begun to re in public debate, by virtue of the wartime equation of racism and nazism.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The conversations of the white GIs and nurses in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> reflect this new turn: they include tales that reflect the inadvertent relaxing of prejudice in the unfamiliarity of wartime surroundings, and tentatively suggest that this relaxation may translate back into the postwar U.S. As content, African Americans re in these forums. 

<p>
Formally, the story is quite different. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>'s resistance to the <i>formal</i> integration of actual black voices (as opposed to white "racial ventriloquism" in the style of <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> or white paternalism in the style of earnest white liberals on many of the discussion shows) follows that of mid-century radio.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Indeed, even on the deliberately provocative <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, black voices were represented


<b></b>


in this period by only three men: Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Walter White of the NAACP (<i>BF</i>, 241). Ironically, African Americans were cast as ill-suited to participation in the discussion of the "racial problem" by virtue of their "bias" on the topic. Here the free and diverse discussion reveals a culturally constructed formal limitation.

<p>
Stein seems quite aware of this formal failure of the radio. <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> attempts to critique this limitation by enacting it.In an unusually speechless moment in <i>Brewsie and Willie</i>, the following scene unfolds: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It was late afternoon and the streets were narrow and three Negro soldiers came along, there was a very little girl and her mother, one of the Negroes fell on his knee like a cavalier before the little girl and took her hand, the mother went on and then stood slightly flushed looking at her little girl, the little girl a little flushed shook the hand of the kneeling soldier, he said a word in French, she answered him, she was a very little girl, only five years old, the other two had gone on, he rose from his knee and he went on, the little girl went along with her mother.

<p class="noIndent">
This interaction is not conveyed via conversation, as is virtually everything else in the text, but by narration. Its incongruity immediately calls attention to the absence of voice&#x02014;we do not hear the African American soldier, any more than the average American heard African American voices on the radio. This compelling re both demands our attention and resists resolution. He particularly seems to resist representing anything other than himself, as if defying the kind of cultural duty that blackness was often compelled to perform in popular entertainment.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  This soldier registers as content; he is not a participant in the form. However, his very inscrutability conveys his resistance to this casting.

<p>
The French that the African American soldier is described as speaking connotes a cosmopolitanism lacking in most of the white GIs. This flexibility extends even beyond the aural. Playful, theatrical, the soldier performs a connection between himself and the young girl, a connection whose eloquence somehow achieves representation in a text otherwise fixated on the representation of voice. Indeed, the scene suggests in several ways that the African American soldier is conversant in multiple languages, employing different forms of voice in order to express himself in a formally limited field. However, in order to suggest this flexibility on the part of the African American GI, <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> must deviate from its discussion-dominated format. Suddenly the text seems to express insecurity about the ability of contemporary radio and radio-inspired forms to register other voices and unusual performances of voice.

<p>
This insecurity is well founded. Wartime radio programming ineffectively attempted to balance the need for greater engagement with questions important to African Americans and the fear of broadcasting "inflammatory" material and voices into an increasingly unstable nation. Even before the racial tensions of the war, African American "voice" was insistently cast as musical and theatrical production. During the war, the Armed Forces Radio Service responded to demands for African American representation in radio programming for the troops by transforming <i>Freedom's People</i>, a series 


<b></b>


that discussed the contributions of African Americans to the nation, into <i>Jubilee</i>, a "fine Negro variety show" (<i>RV</i>, 263). Reporting in 1944 on the role of the mass media in the improvement of race relations, L. D. Reddick confirms that "the usual r&#x000F4;le of the Negro in radio is singing spirituals and folk songs and singing and playing jazz music." However, the radio escapes the more scathing indictments that Reddick hands out to other mass mediums; according to him, "the Negro comes nearer to receiving the same treatment 'as everybody else' over the radio than with any of the other agencies of mass communication." Indeed, according to Reddick, African American voices may be more effectively broadcasted through musical programming, which is usually widely disseminated, for discussion programs favorable to the African American are not carried by Southern stations.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein's text does not seem to know what to make of this culturally-imposed limitation of the radio form. On the one hand, jazz programming does not seem equal to the discursive "facing of the facts" that Stein's epilogue to <i>Brewsie and Willie</i> calls for in the postwar civic conceptualization of the nation. And yet, while the conversation about race was significantly muted after the war victory, African American musical and theatrical voices retained a significant hold on the nation. Scholars of the form have long suggested that jazz and bebop constituted both formal and political programs of resistance for African Americans.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Stein's correspondent Richard Wright seemed to be of that opinion also, explaining to Stein in a letter of 1945 that: "I'm told that one point of solidarity between Negroes and whites in this war was Negro hot music, that when black boys met white boys, they could talk about jazz and swing. It seems like a sort of pass word."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  If network radio sought to evade the "facts" by substituting jazz for African American voices, then, African Americans used jazz to broadcast their own facing&#x02014;and re-shaping&#x02014;of the facts. 

<p>
Stein's radical formalism aligns with the radical formalism of jazz here; her resistance to reading radio as a realistic medium suggests that her words "facing the facts" should not be read as advocating reproduction of the facts. From its outset radio has had the capacity to problematize the idea of "actual black voices." It often did so inadvertently when producers refused to cast African American actors for black roles because they didn't "sound like a Negro."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Walter White made the complexity and contradictions of race in the United States apparent in his day-to-day life and on the radio, but when <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> broadcast on TV, the makeup man "was instructed to darken down White" and "lighten up" one of the other "white" panelists (<i>BF</i>, 238). Radio suggested a realm of vocal performance in which alignment with visually-verifiable (and visually-monitored) "realities" became dangerously slippery. When Langston Hughes participated in "Let's Face the Race Question" on <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i> in 1944, correspondence from one viewer suggested that the form of the program in fact complicated the imperative to "face the race": "What percentage of the audience was colored and how many of those who asked questions were colored? We couldn't tell over the air." (<i>BF</i>, 212) Blackface programs like <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> worked to stabilize this point of slippage by instating dialect as a marker of blackness, but res like White, Hughes and Wright undermined this aural regime 


<b></b>


by self-identifying as black while not sounding like either Amos or Andy.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Radio's gift to the mid-century formulation of race was aural confusion.

<p>
In the adamantly visual <i>Life</i> magazine, Stein proudly wrote of her own role in discursively promoting such confusion; she relates a sergeant's complaint that "I confused the minds of his men, but why shouldn't their minds be confused, gracious goodness, are we going to be like the Germans, only believe in the Aryans that is our own race, a mixed race if you like but all having the same point of view."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  In confusion point of view becomes unstable, as does the relation between self and other. Confusion is mixture, slippage, the collapse of boundaries&#x02014;and it is a strategy long employed by Stein's writing.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Confusion of voices and the identities supposedly signified by these voices; of seemingly stable racial positionings, communities and alliances; of divisions between form and content, discussion and performance&#x02014;all of these were enabled by the mass dispersal of the disembodiment staged by the radio. While, on the one hand, the African American soldier seems to represent the limit case for the discursive formation of community, he also subtly implies that radio has the formal capacity to be productively confused about its own limits. 

<p>
Even in its most powerfully networked phase, radio tended formally towards such indeterminacy. After all, what Stein responds to in radio is not its far-reaching capacity as a vehicle for propaganda, but its far-reaching ineptitude at this task. As United States Commissioner of Education J. W. Studebaker wrote in 1939, impermanence is foremost among the "natural limitations of radio . . . radio is an excellent medium for engaging the interest of the public at large; but in order that this attention be translated into lasting results, other activities of a much more far-reaching nature must be sponsored, to take advantage of the widespread interest which radio is able to arouse."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Stein's appreciation of the creative capacities of wandering attention is well known.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The very impermanence of the radio broadcast ensured that the discussions it promoted would soon wander in different directions. As far as Stein was concerned, the shape of the nation and the public spheres constituting it could no more be directed than could the radio talk through which it took form. 

<p>
Talk, as performed by mid-century radio and Stein's mid-century texts, can provide and promote communal confusion; through the performance of this confusion, a flexible and improvisatory community of communities comes into being. In Stein's work of the 1930s and 1940s, radio is employed as a form that enables m&#x000EA;l&#x000E9;es&#x02014;confusions of voices, identities, races, and programs. While reaching a broad audience, it pursues the cacophonous experimentation that characterizes Stein's early writings. In this way, radio formally enacts the modernist constitution of "contested public spheres," forums in which community is in perpetual discursive formation and deformation. Stein's pursuit of this utopian vision of radio marks her as a thinker of her time, to be numbered among the radio boosters, if in an altogether unusual way. It also suggests that she presciently sensed the pertinence of mass media forms to modernist formal experimentation. Radio in particular was a powerful formal model for an intellectual and expressive moment that valued the broadcasting of multiple voices.

Radio's intimacy of address was often considered responsible for its broad public significance. This suturing of intimacy and public efficacy, the personal and the political, is particularly suggestive in the context of important feminist studies of Stein's intimate politics such as those of Marianne DeKoven, Catharine R. Stimpson, and Lisa Ruddick, and more recently, Ellen Berry and Harriet Chessman.

The testimony of another journalist, quoted by Meyer, suggests that the aurality of the experience is constitutive of this brand of understanding: 


<b></b>


"To hear Miss Stein read her own work is to understand it&#x02014;I speak for myself&#x02014;for the first time . . . . you see why she writes as she does; you see how from sentence to sentence, which seem so much alike, she introduces differences of tone, or perhaps of accent" . Indeed, the journalist's unreflecting use of the word "see" to convey understanding shows just how much conventional concepts of understanding must be recalibrated in order to admit of Stein's aurality.

Despite her own experiment with a version of blackface in "Melanctha," Stein also deplored certain representations of African American voices: "Dialect in books was upsetting, even then and even now, then when there was no esperanto and now when there is no esperanto" (<i>WIHS</i> 23). Book and radio versions of dialect were comparable in the ways in which they unsuccessfully systematized styles of speech that were essentially protean. Melanctha's speech is profoundly unlike these versions of dialect, and Richard Wright's famous response to the accuracy of Stein's depictions of black speech in "Melanctha" stands as testimony to the efficacy of her non-realistic approach to the representation of voice. Stein's depiction, esperanto-like, crosses boundaries rather than policing them.

In <i>The Image of the Poet: British Poets and their Portraits,</i> David Piper laments the "decay" of portraiture "through the first half of the twentieth century, when almost all artists of any originality were uninterested in it, pursuing rather Roger Fry's formal values in painting to the brink of abstraction and beyond." He goes on:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
T. S. Eliot is a case in point. There is little of him other than photographs. Wyndham Lewis's portrait of 1938, though odd enough at the time to cause its rejection by the Academy . . . seems now very conventional, inexpressive in characterization, though a tantalizing encapsulation of publisher/critic/poet in the armour uniform of invisible ordinary man. In context with Wyndham Lewis's work it is more informative about that than it is, in context with Eliot's work, about his poetry . . . Eliot, advocate of "extinction of personality," was famous for his rejection of the picturesque poet's garb. Sober-suited.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
My curiosity was piqued by Piper's comments about the decay of portraiture and modern artists' disinterest in it. I thought of Picasso's cubist, abstract, neo-classical, surreal, and expressionist experiments in the art of portraiture, Giacometti's sculptural

<b></b>

portraits with their strange formal distortions, or Francis Bacon's kinetic, deforming faces and res?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
And what of Piper's claim about the conspicuous absence of other portraits of Eliot? I recalled Theresa Garrett Eliot's pen-sketch of Eliot's face in three-quarter view, made in the 1920s, Wyndham Lewis's numerous pencil, charcoal, ink-and-wash exploratory sketches of him, and Charlotte Eliot Smith's enchanting oil painting (<i>c.</i> 1900) of a twelve-year-old Eliot sitting on a chair, in sculptural side profile, reading a red volume of Shakespeare.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My interest was further stirred by Piper's invocation of that critical albatross of the twentieth century, Eliot's notion of the "extinction of personality." Yet one recalls a famous photograph of Eliot (with Lady Ottoline Morrell), standing by a grand fireplace, slickly coiffured and white flannel trousered, a Prufrockian re, with his self-consciously fashionable dandyism (<i>LOTSE,</i>  27). (Eliot once wrote to Conrad Aiken to ask him to retrieve a valise with "a blue suit in it" because "I want to be able to look <i>herrlich</i>" (splendid) for Lutheran Herr Pfarrer [<i>LOTSE,</i> 40].) Here indeed is Baudelaire's dandy, striving to create "a <i>personal</i> form of originality," "taking the pleasure of causing surprise," and "never showing <i>anyone oneself.</i>"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, there was Piper's astonishingly blas&#x000E9; dismissal of a century of photographic portraiture. Yet two of the most striking photographs of the twentieth century are portraits of Eliot; one is by the German &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; Bill Brandt (hailed as "the Samuel Beckett of photographers" by Cecil Beaton), who captured Eliot's silhouetted re in front of and framed by a Victorian window that makes for a richly monochromic, vigilantly geometrical mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The other is by the great American avant-garde photographer Irving Penn, who created an intensely visceral and scrupulously reductionist image of Eliot, with one half of his face dramatically illuminated by a bone-white, electric light, the other absorbed into an obliterating, illegible darkness.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What Piper seems to be doing is what Seamus Heaney has called "tolling" the "official bell of Faith," re-presenting a familiar narrative and a perfectly tuned formalism cleansed of cultural dissonance.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  As a result he fails to be listening in, or "hearing in" (in Adam Phillips's term), to those more "querulous, outcast melodies" (Heaney) discernible in Eliot's life, art, and times.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Such an approach is the opposite of Walter Benjamin's depiction of the organic contours, auditory coloration, optics, and metaphysical geography of culture and history as ragged, ruinous, polyphonic, a world of "secret affinities," a "magic encyclopedia."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Benjamin's notion that history has a kaleidoscopic and fragmented face that requires attentive scrutiny is one obliquely anticipated more than a century earlier by G. C. Lichtenberg in a comment he made to Goethe about portraiture: "Every moment, we believe that we perceive what we merely infer. It is for this reason that bad portrait painters lay in the entire face all over with pink flesh. They are unable to realise that there could be blue, green, yellow and brown shadows in a human face."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The psychoanalyst Adam Phillips has recently written: "In psychoanalysis life-stories fragment in the telling; in order to be read, interpreted, they have to be unreadable . . . [and] refuse the conventional satisfactions of narrative;" therefore one aim of 

<b></b>

psychoanalysis is to create "a reconstructed life-history that makes the past available as a resource to be thought about, rather than a persecution to be endlessly re-enacted." It is "as much about the making of gaps as about the making of links," its aim being "not to recover the past, but to make recovery of the past possible."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Much the same might be said of a complex cultural criticism, one that would meld the heritage of Benjamin with the original prescriptions of Phillips.
</p>

<p>
Such a critical style may also be especially apposite to modernism. After all, it was Ernest Fenollosa, in that pioneering and most influential of modernist essays, <i>The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry,</i> who wrote: "The truth is that acts are successive, even continuous; one causes or passes into another. And though we may string never so many clauses into a single compound sentence, motion leaks everywhere, like electricity from an exposed wire."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Indeed, Eliot's own work has been viewed as having analogous properties by the poet John Ashbery, who has remarked that <i>The Waste Land,</i> notwithstanding Eliot's "craft and scholarship," "achieves its effect as a collage of hallucinatory, random fragments . . . Their contiguity is all their meaning, and it is implied that from now on meaning will take into account the randomness and discontinuity of modern experience" and "cannot be truthfully defined as anything else."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  A criticism commensurate with the fierce formal ambitions of Eliot's poem would entail a Benjaminesque "cracking open of natural teleology," with its compositional principle of montage form, its "philosophic play of distances, transitions, and intersections," and "its perpetually shifting contexts and ironic juxtapositions."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  It would require a critical practice analogous to the creative practice on view in the painting <i>Study after Vel&#x000E1;zquez</i> by Francis Bacon, who creates vertical folds in the curtain which cut right through the re standing before it, a painterly technique that Bacon termed "shuttering," saying that "it means that the sensation doesn't come straight at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  How would a critical technique assimilate the lesson of Bacon's notion of "shuttering" (enigmatically, a term that spans music, painting, photography, architecture) in order to approach the task of writing about Eliot's life, art, and consciousness? Could such narratives "fragment in the telling" thereby becoming "unreadable," and "a resource to be thought about, rather than a persecution to be endlessly re-enacted?" With these questions in view, I began to search for significant clues, gaps, stray fragments, and leakages in Eliot's <i>oeuvre</i> in relation to his iconography in twentieth-century art history, seeking to reconstruct a critique and life-history off the beaten track of scholarship.
</p>

<p>
T. S. Eliot is one of the most pictorially depicted poets of the twentieth century, indeed of any century. I have collected portraits of him by some forty-five major and other distinguished artists who made paintings, drawings, sketches, sculptures, caricatures, cartoons, photographs, etchings, and mosaics of the poet. The eclectic modes encompassed by these portraits include the classical, surreal, expressionist, rative, cubist, abstract, and social-realist. Their varied media range from monochromic and color prints to oil, charcoal, watercolour, pencil, gouache, pen, crayon, wash, chromatic tessera, clay, iron, and ink. And Eliot's portraitists stem from many national traditions&#x02014;Russian, German, English, Italian, New Zelandish, Irish, Romanian, American, and Polish.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Eliot's interest in art history was serious, sustained, and continually formative to his thinking and his artistic consciousness. As a Harvard undergraduate he attended in 1910 a course on Fine Art and wrote detailed responses to individual painters.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  His early letters are littered with perspicacious and enthused remarks on classical and modern art. In 1914, he wrote to Conrad Aiken of the "<i>stunning</i>" paintings of Flanders, the "<i>treasures</i> in Bruges and Antwerp and Brussels! Memling, van Eyck, Matsys, David, Breughel, Rubens," "a wonderful <i>Crucifixion</i> of Antonello of Messina" and "<i>three</i> great <i>St. Sebastians</i>" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 41). His interest was also on show in his 1915 appeal to Pound: "please tell me who Kandinsky is."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In the same year he wrote to Isabella Stewart Gardner, a prominent Bostonian art collector, to tell her of his new interest in Gaudier-Brzeska, Wyndham Lewis, Jacob Epstein, and Edward Wadsworth (<i>LOTSE,</i> 94). Seven years later, when suggesting to Scofield Thayer possible contributors for the <i>Dial,</i> Eliot urged him to contact the same artists, as well as Walter Sickert. "There are important people in Paris too," he added, "Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, Marchand etc" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 363). Discussing the soon-to-be published <i>Criterion,</i> he informed Pound, "I am particularly anxious to obtain Picabia, for whom I have much respect" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 508). Eliot was also a frequent and discerning visitor of art exhibitions, as can be seen in his "London Letter" of June 1921, in which he comments extensively on the English tradition of caricature and its pertinence to contemporary exhibitions by H. M. Bateman and Wyndham Lewis.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
However the richest vein to mine for understanding Eliot's views on modern art is portraiture, where Eliot tirelessly explored, consolidated, and interrogated his own image. It is as if Eliot lived an enchanting subterranean life, quietly slipping away from his official duties at the offices of Faber and Faber and stealing precious time from his pressing creative and critical work in order to sit for hours for his portraits, often entrusting his image to the unpredictable hands of artists with soaring ambitions. Intriguingly, Eliot was no mere onlooker in the ongoing drama of his portraiture, but a key player (as we shall see in detail later).

In response to an invitation by the legendary Russian mosaicist Boris von Anrep, Eliot wrote on 17 November 1952: "I am most flattered and interested to hear that I am included in your mosaic . . . I shall certainly be most happy to attend the private view at the National Gallery."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Eliot would have seen his portrait in the pavement of the gallery's north vestibule, an allegorical mosaic sequence titled "The Modern Virtues," in which Eliot appears under the theme of "Leisure." Eliot lies on top of a terrace balustrade on an exotic chaise longue decorated with the heads of cats. He appears relaxed but in deep concentration as he contemplates Einstein's formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>. Anrep's famous wit permeates the mosaic: is the poet contemplating problems of the universe or gazing intently on the naked young woman who is mysteriously emerging out of a dark lake? Or is she perhaps a Prufrockian mermaid? Anrep also places symbols of modernist painting, perhaps a Picasso or Braque, and modernist sculpture, to the extreme left of the mosaic.

Wallace Stevens's maxim&#x02014;"The Poet is a god or The young poet is a god. The old poet is a tramp"&#x02014;is illustrated in the four oil portraits of Eliot by the Anglo-Irish artist

Gerald Kelly, works he painted in the early 1960s and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in London.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Eliot was particularly impressed with the first of these and on 29 July 1962 he wrote to Kelly:

In Balzac's <i>Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu</i> (<i>The Unknown Masterpiece</i>), the painter Frenhofer claims, "Mon oeuvre est parfaite" ("My work is perfect"), and the moral and irony of the story is that La Belle Noiseuse may have been perfected out of existence. So Frenhofer cries out: "Ah! Ah! You were not expecting so much perfection. You are in front of a woman, and you are looking for a painting."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The novelist A. S. Byatt notes, "The adjective in the title is <i>inconnu,</i> unknown, and it is not clear whether the word refers to the historical loss of the work, the contemporary failure to recognise a masterpiece, or simply the disappearance of the recognisable forms of the portrait in the dense surface of the paint."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot had known several of his portraitists (Jacob Epstein, Gerald Kelly, and Wyndham Lewis) as friends and compatriot artists. In an interview of 1949, Eliot referred to the "look of slightly quizzical inscrutability" on the face of his portraitist Wyndham Lewis and jokingly accounted for his many portraits by this great artist: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

There is a good deal to be said for sticking to the same doctor. . . There is the same reason for sticking to the same painter&#x02014;if he is a good painter; he knows the history of one's face as well as the expression assumed for the sitting&#x02014;an expression which is sometimes a defensive or bogus one when exposed to the sustained scrutiny of an unfamiliar pair of eyes on the other side of the easel.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot, however, was also willing to accommodate the newer art and pioneering techniques of less established foreign artists whose work was much less familiar to him. Writing from London in 1939 to the now legendary German-Jewish &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; in Paris, the social-realist photographer Gis&#x000E8;le Freund, Eliot says:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

One especially ambitious portfolio of portraits of Eliot is by another then newcomer to the art world, the post-war British abstract painter Patrick Heron. Between 1947 and 1949, Heron made eleven portraits of Eliot in various genres and media (oil, cont&#x000E9; charcoal, blue crayon, chalk), culminating in a final 1949 cubist oil painting with its stereoscopic chromatic diffraction of Eliot's face. Nine are <i>modello</i> studies, or experimental drafts. In a letter of 28 January 1947, Eliot replied to Heron: "I shall be very willing to sit for you, and of course had already been warned of your interest in the possibilities of my features . . . I do not know how you will find my room, the window has a north facing exposure but it is a very small room."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Heron said he "scribble(d) like mad at the sittings" in Eliot's Faber office, trying to capture the "'plastic facts' of Eliot's physiognomy":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Eliot was the most sublime of sitters . . . accommodat[ing] a painter's needs . . . anticipating highly technical requirements . . . once, during one of our sittings . . . he volunteered: "I am now focusing again on the same chimney pot. But that of course does not guarantee the angle of my head." Only a professional model would have had such a conscious awareness of the physical position of his own head. I realised at that moment that Eliot's genius extended far beyond the sphere of the verbal. Obviously he was as aware of the form in space, which was his own body slanted in that tiny room, as a sculptor might have been. I always thought that his comments on pictorial matters had the sort of validity that normally one only encounters in the casual remarks of painters and sculptors themselves.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Indeed, Eliot's spatial intelligence is also evident when he writes about the stage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Just as photography has influenced the art of portrait painting, in that the aim of the modern portrait painter is likely to be directed to doing what the photographer cannot do . . . On the stage . . . the picture&#x02014;the total scene, the movement, posture <strike>posing</strike> and gesture of each member of the cast&#x02014;should be <strike>presented</strike> calculated with a view to completing the message conveyed by the words.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot's repeated willingness to meet the technical needs and accommodate the temperaments of his portraitists says much about his practical artistic acumen and his sustained interest in his own portraiture. Knowing Wyndham Lewis to be a "highly strung, nervous man . . . conscious of his own abilities . . . sensitive to slight or neglect," he nevertheless sat endlessly for him.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Another portraitist, the pioneering Russian born photographer Ida Kar, was a fastidious perfectionist in her shooting sessions.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Her assistant recalls that during one session for portraits of Eliot in 1956 "there were moments of the most excruciating embarrassment. The way she treated T. S. Eliot."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  And when the noted photographer of the famous and fashionable, Slim Aarons, heard that Eliot was in the Bahamas in 1959, he requested a highly stylized photo session with the poet.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In an autobiographical <i>aide m&#x000E9;moire</i> he recalled:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
While doing a Holiday Story about Nassau, I was told that T. S. Eliot has arrived on his honeymoon. I had a sudden idea and called him at his hotel . . . and asked if I could come by and explain what I had in mind . . . I didn't want a typical publicity shot taken in the 

<b></b>

hotel lobby or on his balcony&#x02014;it wouldn't do him or my readers justice, as he was too important a man. I told him of a location I had in mind on the far side of the island (a background I had planned for a beautiful-girl shot, aptly named Love Beach). All it had was a palm-front hut on a lonely beach used by romantic swimmers who wanted to get away from the tourists. He understood completely what I was trying to do and agreed to drive out there with me and Mrs Eliot. They both admired the setting, and with good humour fell into the pose. All the while I kept thinking of his famous lines from "Prufrock": "I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk up [<i>sic</i>] the beach / I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each." When we had finished he asked me if I would mind doing him a favour. I said, "Anything, Mr. Eliot, anything."' He asked if I would take a picture of him with his wife . . . he took her hand and looked at her with great tenderness. I remembered how I struggled to follow the sophisticated dialogue of his play <i>The Cocktail Party,</i> which I had seen in New York&#x02014;it was the one play you couldn't sleep through if you wanted to grasp the lines&#x02014;and there he was, the great poet, in love.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

In a Prufrockian mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne, a tanned Eliot is posed, seated on a white deck chair on a golden beach, clothed in a white shirt and creamy white suit (with rolled trousers), white shoes, and a raffish, ribboned Panama hat. In the background is a mirror-calm sea and a luscious, green palm-tree. The soft pastels of pinks, blues and creams of Aarons's portrait of the poet convey the quintessence of a lifestyle of wealth, ease, and elegance. Yet, beyond this glamorous public image, in a later letter of 1962 addressed to someone else, we glimpse Eliot's more candid view of Nassau's fashionable culture: "This year, after Christmas we . . . return to Nassau where we went three years ago. We do not much like Nassau, but the beach at that hotel is magnificent and swimming in warm sea water is the best exercise in the world for me."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's portraits are resonant with significance. In their sheer plenitude they give us a visual feast of new and exciting images of this major poet, of which many have remained unpublished and unseen for years. They also unveil a fascinating cache of accompanying manuscript and critical material that relates to Eliot's views on art and the creation of his images, material that also stretches our received understanding of his biography. Letters, journals, autobiographies, mementoes, interviews, and essays in which Eliot's portraitists record their views of their famous sitter reveal the creative processes and tensions entailed in the making of an original portrait. 
</p>

<p>
Intriguingly, what is also revealed is Eliot keenly and consciously self-fashioning his image, a process that casts doubt on any notion of a static, unified human identity and reflects his own passion for metamorphosis. The images of the artistic subject continuously dissolve and re-form, becoming almost a pictorial counterpart to his allusive and protean poetics. From the prolific Polish artist Zdzislaw Czerm&#x000E1;nski's winsomely witty and paradoxical depiction of Eliot as a black-suited, bowler-hatted, Mallaca-caned banker-poet who rides on a white winged Pegasus (cover illustration), to Gis&#x000E8;le Freund's raw, tense, full-face close-up color photograph; from the soft-focussed, stylized, three-quarter face of the 1920s photograph by E. O. Hopp&#x000E9; to Theresa Garrett Eliot's sketch of Eliot asleep on a chaise-longe; from her bright watercolour of the poet writing, alone in a drawing room, to Thomas Derrick's 1932 flowing cartoon-caricature design of Eliot riding a Melvellian whale and surrounded by lamenting mermaids as he leaves 

<b></b>

for America; from the 1948 "reportage portrait" of the black silhouetted re of Eliot walking solitary in a park by the photojournalist Felix Man to Boris Artzybasheff's richly allusive and surreally Daliesque painting: Eliot's image undergoes, in the hands of these artists, many transmutations and metaphorical variations&#x02014;a kind of magical artistic shamanism.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The portraits also have bibliographic pertinence, for they became an occasion for Eliot to make cameo appearances in publications as diverse as <i>Vogue,</i> the <i>Bookman, Harper's Bazaar, Punch,</i> the <i>Sunday Times, Picture Post, Time,</i> the <i>Dial,</i> and <i>Boston Evening Transcript,</i> with cultural contexts and audiences that far exceeded purely literary ones. More important, Eliot's art and image were assimilated by an international group of artists, inscribed into their own aesthetics and absorbed into artistic cross-currents and cross-fires. The making of an Eliot portrait became, more than once, a dramatic mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne for the artistic manifestos, dialogues, rivalries, and camaraderie between the different portraitists and also their subject, often slipped into remarks obliquely made or outright declaimed. Wyndham Lewis, for instance, competed with fellow artists Patrick Heron and William Rothenstein for possession of Eliot's image; he also wittily sniped at his sitter in December 1938, writing to Ezra Pound: "<u>The Undertaker</u> (as Lady Ott. called 'poor Tom') has been here to sit and I have done a lot of useful work on his face. It is going to be a very good portrait indeed. You will see it in New York, I hope."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In fact Lewis's controversial 1938 oil painting of Eliot sparked a national debate in England about the nature and direction of modern portraiture, an endless "row in the papers about Wyndham Lewis's rejected portrait of Tom" which Virginia Woolf jotted in her diary entry of 3 May 1938.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, through the prism of these portraits we can see also how numerous women artists (Charlotte Eliot Smith, Theresa Garrett Eliot, Aim&#x000E9;e Lamb, Gis&#x000E8;le Freund, Jean Shepeard, Ida Kar, Kay Bell Reynal, Celia Scott, Katerina Wilczynski, Peggy Bacon, and Milein Cosman) could venture into a predominantly male art world and nurture their portraiture.
</p>

<p>
To see the canonized re of Eliot amidst the cross-cultural mises-en-sc&#x000E8;ne of modern art is to see an alphabet scattered, or a dictionary come alive. In his poignant preface to the facsimile of the drafts of <i>The Waste Land,</i> Ezra Pound wrote, "The more we know of Eliot, the better."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The uncovering of these long-neglected portraits opens just such a prospect.

Indian street musicians, a still life of a flowering bush, St Paul's Cathedral after a bombing, or even "A Ghurka Soldier Transporting a Wounded Man on His Back Through the Jungle, c.1945." Beaton's vast portrait portfolio includes Cole Porter, Marlene Dietrich, Henry Moore, Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, Noel Coward, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dali. It captures Aldous Huxley surrealistically poking his head through a vertical slit in a gauze curtain, Edith Sitwell lying on a tomb in ornate garments, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in a studio (with studio wires included), Marianne Moore with her "perpetually startled" face, Queen Elizabeth on the day of the Coronation, and Winston Churchill in the cabinet room.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A member of the <i>grande bourgeoisie,</i> Beaton was born in London, and already when a child he was passionately preoccupied with portraiture; in role-playing and stage-directed shots, he photographed his pretty sisters as renaissance princesses, nymphs, nuns, and stars. Inspired by the romantic portraits of Baron de Meyer, lavish fashion photographs by Edward Steichen, and allegorical photographs of the Edwardian age, Beaton's lens captured not simply his subject but a preconceived milieu, an aesthetic ambience. Rightly, Roy Strong has called Beaton one of the greatest <i>interpreters</i> of human persona in the twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  "My intention," Beaton explained, "seemed to be to make the camera do the work of a painter or designer. By placing strong patterns and intricate textures in the background, the sitter was used as part of a decorate scheme thought up beforehand. Sometimes the sitter's identity became subordinate to a decoration of polka dots, palm fronds or cubist patterns."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Reinforcing that description, Truman Capote observed that a sitter for Beaton had "a sense of <i>slightly</i> drifting into space&#x02014;of not being photographed but painted . . . by a casual, barely visible presence" ("I," 13). It was not by chance that Beaton routinely shifted between photography and designing d&#x000E9;cors and costumes for stage, ballets, and films. "I had two careers," he once said, "photography and set designing. They overflowed constantly."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Scrapbook,</i> Beaton says: "Photography must always be a representation of what is in front of the lens, at the moment of the exposure, but much of the art of the serious photographer lies in knowing how to simplify for the sake of emphasis," and "retouching will play its part and to visualise the final product."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Truman Capote, discussing Beaton's portraiture, made a similar point:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . no one had photographed faces in quite this manner before, surrounded them with such neo-romantic, stylised d&#x000E9;cor (spun glass, masked statues, pastry-moulds, and extravagant costumes: all the appurtenances of Beaton's own surrealism), or lighted them with such lacquered luminosity . . . the timeless quality in these pictures . . . in the series Beaton calls Time Sequences&#x02014;subjects he has had the opportunity to photograph over periods extending as much as four decades . . . how eerie . . . sad . . . exhilarating . . . faces flow through time&#x02014;frozen by sensitively manipulated light and shadow.

Beaton's interest in Eliot was longstanding. Already in 1927 Kyrle Leng, Beaton's friend, had suggested to him: "I think that you had better have a little house of your own and have intimate relations with T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf . . . You would probably evolve a style of painting, or writing which would make you famous and 

<b></b>

rich."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Beaton's first encounter with Eliot occured when he was still a student at Cambridge University, where he "attended a talk by T. S. Eliot and longed to stand up and contradict him just to see his reaction."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In the <i>Autobiography</i> that he published five years before he took his photographs of Eliot, Beaton recalled his unsuccessful efforts to secure Eliot as a sitter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Mr Eliot is the only person I can bring to mind who has ever refused to be counted among my sitters. He explained that it would be impossible to decide what sort of collar he should wear for the pictures; a soft one would look untidy . . . Bohemian . . . yet he could not bring himself to be perpetuated in a standard one.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1956, however, Beaton finally persuaded Eliot to allow him to make a reel of forty-three portrait shots; in his description of the poet, Beaton quotes Eliot's lines "How <i>delightful</i> to meet Mr. Eliot, / With his features of clerical cut," and says:<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Thus does this aquiline poet describe his appearance . . . it is true that with his smoothed silken hair so neatly parted slightly off-centre . . . his parchment complexion . . . pursed lips, he has something of the look of a parson. But the comparison ends there. No parson could have spent so many years in diamond-cutting his experience and literary gifts, offering them to us in a perceptive body of literary criticism, in poetry . . . in plays which have attracted audiences . . . without any intellectual condescension . . . Eliot has variously been accused of being a snob, a conservative, an anti-semitic, authoritarian, oligarchic, a preacher, bloodless, filled with death wishes. Some of these things may perhaps be read into his work. But the greatness of those spare, taut lines that have such evocative power cannot be denied.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Indeed Beaton's portrait portfolio of Eliot reflects him both as an eminent critic and imaginative artist with a complex consciousness. From the astonishing style and range of the forty-three pictures he took in 1956 at the Faber offices, I have chosen two shots which reflect Beaton's varying angles on a famous re.
</p>

<p>
One feature that distinguishes many of the photographs is the use that Beaton made of a frosted glass partition that featured in Eliot's Faber and Faber office. Eliot himself commented on this, according to Beaton's biographer: "The prickly poet found the poses somewhat <i>theatrical</i> but wrote&#x02014;'I have had many photographs taken in this particular room, but no one before has thought of making use of the glass partition; and with such astonishingly successful effect.'"<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Beaton took several highly posed shots of Eliot besides the reflecting pane glass, effectively doubling his image. In one photograph, Beaton closes in on the head and shoulders: Eliot looks up, leaning against the cabinet, while Beaton shoots from below to create a strong refraction of light on the glass of his spectacles, through which, finely, the eyes are just visible (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). In this translative interplay of lenses (camera, glasses, eyes) and perspectives, Beaton enacts Roland Barthes's idea that the spectator "cannot reach into the photograph," can only "sweep it" with a "glance," and it is "precisely in this <i>arrest</i> of interpretation that the photograph's certainty resides."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

In another shot, Eliot is red full-length leaning against a book cabinet, one hand on the hip, the other resting on his head (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Uniquely, this is the only full profile portrait of Eliot and Beaton may perhaps have wanted to capture his tall, sleek, dandified re. Yet historically, full-length portraits were usually reserved for rulers and nobility, and Beaton's witty imagination may be teasing out this idea. In a third photograph, not included here, Beaton also makes a darker, intimate portrait of Eliot sitting in an armchair, half in shadow, with hands gathered and fingers trellised, creating an image of complex introspection. In Barthes's term, the old hands here are the <i>punctum</i> of the photograph, which, he says, is the "sting, speck, cut, little hole&#x02014;and also a cast of the dice. A photograph's <i>punctum</i> is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)" (<i>CL,</i> 27). It reminds us: "Whether or not the subject is already dead . . . every photograph is (a) catastrophe . . . (it) always contains (an) imperious sign of my future death" (<i>CL,</i> 96-7).

David Low was a New Zealander who became one of the most famous political caricaturists of the twentieth century. At seventeen he became political cartoonist with the Christchurch <i>Spectator</i>; in 1911, he left for Australia to work on the <i>Bulletin,</i> where for the next nine years he produced <i>The Billy Book,</i> a compilation of caricatures of Billy Hughes, Australia's colorful prime minister. Low began his London career in 1919 with the <i>Star,</i> an afternoon daily with Liberal affiliations. In 1927 he began his twenty-three-year association with the <i>Evening Standard</i>: the arch-liberal caricaturist working for an arch-conservative newspaper created a dynamic synergy. Low established a worldwide reputation as a champion of democracy and freedom against the forces of aggression and fascism; his caricatures of Mussolini and Hitler were iconic; he depicted post-war Britannia as a bewildered creature whose trident and shield were a broom and dustpan; and during the same period he created his most famous cartoon character, Colonel Blimp.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of his career Low developed his distinctive views of satire and caricature. "Great caricaturists," wrote Low, are "philosophers, whose pictorial satire [is] the vehicle for interpreting and exhibiting their own passions. The close relation between a draughtsman's hand and mental disposition . . . is the excuse for asserting that caricature, at its highest, can be essence of mind and a great art of vital practice . . . perpetual renewal."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  "Caricature in its most important practice," he also wrote, "is satirical, and satire is essentially an art of complaint."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Some critics, however, have detected limitations in Low's achievement. Clement Greenberg thought his political insight was "liberal with decent instincts . . . a large endowment of common sense humour," but also "without any positive political ideas" and "devoid of political imagination."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  "Like every first-rate journalist," Greenberg went on, "Low provides us with a proper state of mind, not with truth or information." His skill lay elsewhere. In "almost

any one of his cartoons . . . you will see how little its effect depends on its 'idea' and how much on the drawing and design." In reality he was "a remarkable draftsman, a worthy continuator of the great but still largely unrecognized nineteenth-century English tradition of popular graphic art."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Low's art may not possess the serious pessimism of Honor&#x000E9; Daumier, but it was acerbic enough for Wyndham Lewis to write to Low: "Dryden described the satirist as flying over his victims and dropping 'molten iron' upon them. I do not know what the correct image would be for your satire, but it would be far more insidious and equally destructive, I think, by far the fantastic variety&#x02014;like Dyson . . ."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  And contrary to Greenberg's claim, Low's best art represents a potent synergy between design, drama, and idea, delicately unveiling hidden truths through humour and satire. At the very least it was much appreciated by prominent res who were not professional art critics, writers such as Arthur Koestler, Somerset Maugham, J. B. Priestley, or Bertolt Brecht; British politicians such as Clement Attlee, Stanley Baldwin, Aneurin Bevin, and Michael Foot; actors such as Alec Guinness and Charlie Chaplin; and thinkers as diverse as Bertrand Russell, Sigmund Freud, John Maynard Keynes, and Isaiah Berlin.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

Low made two pencil sketches of Eliot, an undated head-and-shoulders portrait, and a 1945 sketch of the poet seated on a wooden chair (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). Eliot did not sit for his first portrait, but for the 1945 drawing Low hesitantly drafted a note to him, requesting a sitting:

Low's ambition to make a "study in personality with a caricatural emphasis" is palpable in his Eliot sketch. It is not simply <i>outr&#x000E9;</i>, which William Hogarth defines as a caricatural drawing which "signifies nothing more than the exaggerated outline of a re," and does not express a deeper "character."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Eliot's monolithic nose and chin are comically extended and Low captures the famously stooped shoulders, anxious eyes, and pursed mouth. With varying emphasis and restraint Low's pencil creates a detailed hatching in the seated portrait which creates depth and volume. Valerie Eliot wrote to Low on 30 September 1957:

Low's portraits of Eliot, as Ernst Gombrich says of caricature in general, "make us laugh" and "save a lot of energy" through "this tendency to classify and simplify" the human re, at the same time as they provoke, "in a flash," discoveries "that the new mask can also serve to unmask."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  The discomfort one notices in Low's caricatures of Eliot is precisely the discomfort of public fixity; the deeper Prufrockian trauma of "having known":

The firm of Elliott &amp; Fry was founded in 1863 and based in London's Baker Street. It employed distinguished photographers such as Francis Henry Hart and Alfred James Philpott in the Edwardian era, Herbert Lambert in the 1920s and 1930s, and William Flowers in subsequent years. In the early 1940s the studio was bombed and most of its early negatives destroyed, but the firm remained in business. Michael Pritchard writes:

The typical Elliott and Fry photograph consists of a head-and-shoulders shot customarily taken in the studio interior against a plain backdrop. The subject either looks fully frontally into the lens or is shown in three-quarter profile. Unusually, Elliott &amp; Fry photographed Eliot in a sculptural full side-profile. On 28 February 1939, Eliot wrote to E. McKnight Kauffer, acknowledging photographs that Kauffer had recently taken of him and adding: "OTHERwise [<i>sic</i>] they are a great deal better than Elliott and Fry have done for me."<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  As chroniclers of the elite of English society, Elliott and Fry portray Eliot as a distinguished man of letters and public re (<a href="#4"> 4</a>). Indeed, the portrait is highly posed and Eliot may have disliked the staid, stony, unimaginative posturing required of him. The black background and black suit is off-set with the aureole of intense silvery studio light directed upon the poet&#x02014;giving his face an opalescent glow and marble-like solidity. In spite of Eliot's dislike of his portrait, the tonal perfectionism of the photograph gives it a texture close to that of an oil painting. The firm was notable for the quality of its prints. Enthused with the novelty of photography, Queen Victoria wrote in 1890 to her daughter: "I send you today some plantinotypes from platino which have been brought to a great perfection by Elliott and Fry."

Augustus John once noted William Rothenstein's "vehement nature, irresponsibility," his "moral intelligence," his "<i>penchant</i> for the dramatic," and "a passionate respect and love for the older masters" that was counterbalanced by a willingness "to greet modern manifestations with sympathy."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  Rothenstein believed that artists should confront the reality of the marketplace and in 1940 he wrote to George Bernard Shaw:
</p>

the English are attracted by drawing, an art so greatly prized by the French. And more than any body else it was Rothenstein who compelled people here for a while (for they have relapsed) to recognise the technical beauties of this sometimes rather shoppy form of artistic expression. . . .<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Rothenstein studied at the Slade School of Art in London for a year under Alphonse Legros, who was a friend of Rossetti and a disciple of Mantegna, Poussin, and Rembrandt. "We really did <i>draw,</i>" he later recalled, "at a time when elsewhere in England students were rubbing . . . tickling their paper with stump chalk, charcoal and india rubber." Legros "taught us to draw freely with the point, to build up our drawings by observing the broad planes of the model." He insisted "that we study the relations of light and shade and half-tone . . . this was a severe and logical method of constructive drawing."<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Rothenstein continued his studies in art at the Acad&#x000E9;mie Julian in Paris between 1888 and 1893 and travelled widely. He was driven, he later said, by "an unabating urge to draw . . . to make some record of contemporaries whose work has stirred my admirations."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  By 1926 his portfolio of eight hundred portraits included Walter Pater, John Singer Sargent, Paul Verlaine, Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, Arthur Symons, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, W. B. Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, Edmond de Goncourt, Algernon Swinburne, George Bernard Shaw, Andr&#x000E9; Gide, Augustus John, Walter de la Mare, Havelock Ellis, David Low, Somerset Maughan, Aldous Huxley, Einstein, and E.M. Forster. "I was possessed," he later said of his early work, "with the faith that if I concerned myself wholly with appearance, something of the mystery of life might creep into my work . . . Through devotion to appearance we may even interpret a reality which is beyond our conscious understanding."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Explaining his portrait technique, Rothenstein wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I must usually make two, sometimes more attempts, often starting afresh from a tracing from a first drawing, having thus the structure lightly indicated. I do not know whether I acquired this method from Degas; it was one he often used for his studies. Occasionally a drawing happens to come reasonably well within the first hour . . . I prefer the more direct touch of sanguine or chalk to pastel . . . A drawing is like a lyric, a happy pattern of lines, a combination of blitheness and precision, in which luck also plays a part, as do the quality of paper or chalk, the mood of the sitter, or one's own. Each time a portrait is attempted, I pray inwardly that the winged spirit may come into hand and pencil; for the pencil has its own cunning and the hand its wisdom.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot wrote to Rothenstein in October 1928: "If you cared to make a drawing of me, nothing would give me more pleasure . . . Do you prefer your own studio, or my office at Russell Square, or my house? . . . if you choose my house, I should try to include my cat in the picture . . . I should be glad to know also how long a sitting you like; so I can arrange both time and place to suit you, and without interruption."<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In May 1929, Eliot wrote to him again: "Thank you very much for your . . . invitation. I shall do my best to come: partly for the vanity of seeing my own mug in a distinguished exhibition, and because it is a likeness which I consider true and Monro 

<b></b>

considers flattering."<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  Wyndham Lewis commented on Eliot's portrait in a letter to Rothenstein: "I go primarily for the pattern of the structure of the head and insinuate, rather than stress, the 'psyche.' You, on the contrary, have I think here and there lost yourself a little in your psychology, as witness your T. S. Eliot. I did not even recognise it at first. But how interesting that you should see Tom like that!"<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Vivienne Eliot, according to her biographer, "felt that her husband would be pleased as she hung a large portrait of him by Sir William Rothenstein in the drawing room . . . Her 'altar' to Tom was flanked on each side by two Venetian mirrors" and "on another wall she hung a sketch of Eliot by Wyndham Lewis."<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  The apparent simplicity of Rothenstein's portrait facing the aesthetic and intellectual complexity of Lewis's portrait is symbolic of the way Eliot would absorb and appreciate aesthetic differences. 
</p>

<p>
Rothenstein's 1929 chalk sketch of Eliot is an intense focus on the head of the poet which is drawn in a three-quarter profile (<a href="#5"> 5</a>). Rothenstein envisages the forty-one year old Eliot as a more youthful re than his years should warrant; the face is full and unlined except for the faint furrow at the brows and Eliot has the distant dreamy look that we see in his 1920s photograph by E. O. Hopp&#x000E9;. Although Rothenstein's portrait is simple, it is also evocative and intricate in its attentiveness to local detail. The eyes and eyebrows are drawn with a certain delicacy, as is the mouth. The portrait is almost sculptural in its boldness of form and profile. Rothenstein's explanation that his portrait art combines blitheness and precision can be seen in his drawing of Eliot which is, in Rothenstein's terms, lyrical. Indeed the drawing reflects Rothenstein's aesthetic motive in portraiture: "It is not likeness, as the sitter who is not an artist may think, but construction, the rhythm of form set down with clear and firm touch which are the concern of the draughtsman."<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>

</p>

<p>
In 1921 he went to Paris where he joined the Dada group and had immediate success with his first exhibition of paintings, photographs, and "rayograms"; he also showed a film, <i>Le Retour de la Raison,</i> assembled out of experimental clips. From 1940 to 1950 he lived in Hollywood and did fashion photography and painting. Explaining his radical aesthetic, he wrote:

Man Ray was an architect, draftsman, painter, photographer, filmmaker, sculptor, writer, and poet.<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  Henri Cartier-Bresson and Bill Brandt aptly called him "the grand master," and Jed Perl says as a Surrealist he was "sceptical of the idea of artistic specialisations . . . formality . . . professionalisation of a bourgeois society," and his work "reflects with pure Dada <i>esprit</i> the glee of spontaneous discovery."<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>  As a member of the proto-Dada group in New York in 1920, Man Ray was joined by Marcel Duchamps and Francis Picabia. "Mystery," he claimed, "this was the key word close to my heart and mind"; and in a contemporary letter he wrote, "I'm trying to make my photography automatic&#x02014;to use my camera as I would a typewriter."<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Jean-Hubert Martin says that for years Man Ray had been trying to produce an image that would "preserve the ambiguity of objects exposed to the light by including their shadows . . . The play of greys and blacks reveals the presence of the light and the creation of space."<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>  Beaton remarks, "He was a magician in the art of finding new variations and effects" (<i>MI,</i> vii).
</p>

<p>
Man Ray's portraits are uncompromisingly direct; his subjects are exclusively of great artists and include Sch&#x000F6;enberg, Braque, Matisse, L&#x000E9;ger, Miro, Giacometti, Picasso, Ernst, Joyce, Woolf, Balthus, Breton, Cocteau, Pound, and Duchamps. Beaton wrote of Man Ray's aesthetic technique:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Man Ray decided that sharpness of image is not the essential goal, but that it is more important to give the portrait its profound meaning . . . (he) worked with a long focal lens . . . the greater the re who sits for him, the more he effaces himself and remains "neutral." In such cases he seems to confine himself to likenesses that are seemingly innocuous. In reality he achieves definitive portraits . . . Each portrait reflects a unique instant.

Perl rightly notes that his portraits give "the impression of pushing the camera practically into the subject's face, erasing the traditional space between artist and subject, between judge and judged" ("I," 5). Man Ray invariably uses natural (not studio)

light, and his prints have a strong definition, with clear contrast and sitters placed in informal poses; he was influenced by Alfred Stieglitz's dictum "No diffused focus. Just the straight goods" ("I," 9). Perl explains:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Man Ray's photographs have dense, nearly opaque surfaces; we sense a tension between the primary plane of the photographic and the intimations of depth expressed through the lights and shades of the world. The photographer wants us to remember that the world has been caught in a flat surface, that what we see is but a <i>partial portrait</i>. Mysteriously (the) photographs carry a double message . . . we are impressed with a sense of loss&#x02014;the passage of the moment that the photograph has recorded&#x02014;and a sense of gain&#x02014;the perpetuation of that moment . . .

Man Ray made a number of black and white portrait-photographs of Eliot in the 1930s which are some of the most candidly direct images of the poet, yet also possess Man Ray's inimitable panache and delicate romanticism. In his <i>Autobiography</i> Man Ray explained: "Two Americans settled in England, Curtis Moffat, a painter, and Ted McKnight Kauffer, a well-known poster-designer, were very assiduous in sending me sitters from London . . . I photographed the writers&#x02014;T. S. Eliot; Havelock Ellis . . . Aldous Huxley, posed so his bad eye would not show; Virginia Woolf, whose ascetic face was framed in a severe arrangement of her hair."<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>  Eliot wrote to Kauffer: "I think the Man Ray photographs a brilliant piece of work and certainly better than any I have ever had taken."<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>  Man Ray's caption under one of his photographs of Eliot reads: "Interests me just as little as I interest him."<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Man Ray wrote: "The eyes not only receive an outward image but give forth an image of an invisible thought."<sup><a name="REF95" href="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>  In one image of Eliot, Man Ray captures the face in full-frontal, close-up intimacy focussing on his facial expression and especially on the poet's penetrating eyes (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). Barthes writes: "The conventions of photography are replete with signs. A full-face photograph underlines the realistic outlook . . . expresses penetration, gravity, frankness . . . looking squarely at the . . . obstacle, the 'problem.'"<sup><a name="REF96" href="#FOOT96">96</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In another three-quarter face and shoulder image, Eliot frowns and the felt immediacy of Man Ray's print reveals dark shadows under his eyes (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). Barthes comments: "A three-quarter face photograph . . . suggests the tyranny of an ideal: the gaze is lost nobly in the future, it does not confront, it soars, and fertilises some other domain, which is chastely left undefined."<sup><a name="REF97" href="#FOOT97">97</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The backdrop in all the Eliot photographs are a plain white, which does not detract the viewer from the intensity of the face. Man Ray wrote:

when man turns to imitating the processes of nature, he invariably tries to substitute permanence for repetition . . . which does not exist in nature.

Barthes would agree; "I do not believe in 'lifelike' photographs," he wrote (<i>CL,</i> 20). Indeed, Barthes writes: "it was the chemists" who invented photography: "For the <i>noeme</i> 'That-has-been' was possible only on the day when a scientific circumstance (the discovery that silver halogens were sensitive to light) made it possible to recover and print directly the luminous rays emitted by a variously lighted object . . . From a real body, which was there, proceed radiations which ultimately touch me . . . the photograph of the missing being . . . will touch me like the delayed rays of a star" (<i>CL,</i> 80-1).

Topolski gained fame initially as a caricaturist; he moved to England in 1935, then between 1940 and 1945 served in exile as an official war artist for Poland. In his iconoclastic autobiography <i>Fourteen Letters</i> he recalled himself as "the young foreigner [who], even unpossessed of the language, is in no time acquainted on terms of equality with his neighbours . . . Augustus John . . . Jacob Epstein . . . Nye Bevan, John Rothenstein . . ."<sup><a name="REF101" href="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>  Indeed, Picasso, Prince Philip, Harold Macmillan, and Kenneth Tynan were all to be visitors at Topolski's London studio.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Fourteen Letters,</i> Topolski explains his aesthetic: "Malraux claimed that: 'the fact that the word <i>painting</i> is linked with <i>picture</i> has paralysed us.' This labyrinth, uncurbed, unframed, non-picture painting is my answer to this. A bizarre idea: painting throughout my life the same 'panorama'&#x02014;varying / enlarging / broadening in themes / experience."<sup><a name="REF102" href="#FOOT102">102</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Feliks Topolski is the Walter Benjamin of the art world&#x02014;an obsessive chronicler of a politically unstable and culturally uncontainable world. In 1946 he said: "We need an art of synthesis, painting fed on reality . . . of multitudes on the move, of global oneness, torn by conflicts, and achieved, not by retrogression into 'realism,' but through the formal freedom won by modern art."<sup><a name="REF103" href="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>  In a letter to Bertrand Russell, Topolski would insist on his autonomy: "I am a side-liner; a pictorial recorder of history made by others . . . there is no citizen or revolutionary reformer above my artistic self."<sup><a name="REF104" href="#FOOT104">104</a></sup> 
</p>

In a letter to the novelist Rebecca West, Topolski wrote: "I am commissioned . . . by an American foundation to paint twenty portraits of English writers your name is on

In a letter to Harry Ransom of 18 November 1960, Lew David Feldman wrote: "We have . . . written to T. S. Eliot and E. M. Forster requesting their co-operation in lending themselves to Mr. Topolski's portraiture."<sup><a name="REF107" href="#FOOT107">107</a></sup>  Eliot, however, did not sit for the oil portrait that Topolski made of him and instead Topolski drew from his imagination and memory.<sup><a name="REF108" href="#FOOT108">108</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In <i>Fourteen Letters,</i> Topolski recounts his first meeting with Eliot: "almost as awed as the rest of the youngsters round him, I once sat with him at Bertorelli's in Charlotte Street&#x02014;a focal locality of pre-war Bohemia . . . but, not as a worshipper, somewhat distanced from the master-disciples' aura." Topolski also recalls his encounter with Eliot which resulted in the "Rush Hour on the Underground" sketch:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I chanced on him in the fifties on an underground train and began to sketch at a distance even before realising who was this uncharming, haughty, black-homburged, black-coated city gent, attracted by his obvious rush-hour contrast with the subordinate and indifferent secretarial breed around. This resulted in a largish painting&#x02014;invention of a ceremonially red-robed Eliot in an honour-giving scene.<sup><a name="REF109" href="#FOOT109">109</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In his sketch of Eliot observed while sitting on a London underground train, one sees the rhythmic swirls and broken, flying strokes of Topolski's pencil style, a "bird's nest tangle" as one observer called it (<a href="#8"> 8</a>).<sup><a name="REF110" href="#FOOT110">110</a></sup>  Bernard Denvir has described his technique as "a great explosion of linear exploration, the paper covered with a palpitating mass of lines from which the subject emerges&#x02014;as it does in Giacometti's drawings&#x02014;with an almost sculptural quality."<sup><a name="REF111" href="#FOOT111">111</a></sup>  Or as Harold Acton once described Topolski's form in general, the feeling is "robust, cosmopolitan, mercurial, insatiable, witty," with "a gift for characterisation expressed in a rapid, varied and individual vernacular."<sup><a name="REF112" href="#FOOT112">112</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's portrait drawing is raw, immediate, and alive, a symphony of spare, precise, fierce, complex lines asking to be understood in concert. The sketch observes and explores human posture and expression, the conration of a head in relation to other heads, the tenseness or slump of a body, the outline of a nose or chin. The sketch reveals also the extreme tension of momentarily contingent discoveries which Topolski's draftsmanship is eternally engaged in.
</p>

<p>
Eliot looks straight ahead (if indeed he looks at all), as the furious, wiry swirls in the eye sockets create graffiti-like, "damned scriggles."<sup><a name="REF113" href="#FOOT113">113</a></sup>  The nose is the classic Eliotic eagle's beak, the mouth prim, the whole demeanor haughtily self-contained, and in a witty, ironic collision with Topolski's irrepressible style. James Laver has written of Topolski:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
his single res are masterly . . . at once as true as a snapshot and as full of content as a hieroglyphic . . . great satirical powers, an extraordinary capacity for seizing upon essential lines of his subjects and representing them with just the right degree of exaggeration 

<b></b>. . . a sheer beauty of draughtsmanship . . . his object is always to study the meaning, the dramatic significance, of what he sees.<sup><a name="REF114" href="#FOOT114">114</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's likeness is retrieved by the viewing eye though the tangled texture of lines in motion, rather than mimetically affirmed by the artist with an easily assimilated or appropriated static structure of the predicted form of a human face and re. Like Wittgenstein or Wallace Stevens, Topolski reorganizes the grammar of our relation to the world we habitually inhabit.
</p>

<p>
Topolski's visions and explorations are purely pictorial and he resists any expectations for an artist to be tendentious or above humanity, saying: "I am not out to explain anything . . . I try to communicate my problems and solutions, and the mixture is probably as impenetrable as life."<sup><a name="REF115" href="#FOOT115">115</a></sup>

The characteristic qualities of John Gay's photographs, remarked the poet John Betjeman, were the "art of capturing the atmosphere and character of a place" and "photographing significant detail."<sup><a name="REF117" href="#FOOT117">117</a></sup>  This observation is equally pertinent for Gay's beguilingly straightforward portrait photographs. Betjeman, in his preface to Leonard Clark's <i>Prospect of Highgate and Hampstead,</i> which Gay photographed, writes:
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
Gay's atmospheric and characterful Hampstead scenes included "The Whitestone Pond," "The Church in Holly Walk" and many others.
</p>

<p>
Gay's distinguished portrait sitters, photographed in black and white, were international res from the world of the arts and included Hillare Belloc, Ford Maddox Ford, Walter de la Mare, Somerset Maughan, Rabindranath Tagore, Vita Sackville West, Dylan Thomas, John Betjeman, C. S. Lewis, Arnold Bennett, Willa Cather, Daphne du Maurier, and Richard Strauss. Invariably, Gay photographed his subjects in their own mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne and not in a studio setting.

Eliot is pictured in his Faber office&#x02014;behind him is a high glass book cabinet and to his right a large desk filled with manuscripts and books (<a href="#9"> 9</a>). He stands, donned in a jet-black three-piece suit and black tie, his right hand firmly resting on the books on the table and his left hand's thumb in the pocket of his waistcoat. He looks soberly and directly into Gay's lens. Gay's portrait very much conveys the poet's role as a director of a publishing house and distinguished man of letters&#x02014;an image of formality and containment. Roland Barthes writes:

The photographic look has something paradoxical about it which is sometimes to be met with in life . . . One might say that the Photograph separates attention from perception, and yields up only the former, even if it is impossible without the latter; this is that aberrant thing, <i>noesis</i> without <i>noeme,</i> an action of thought without thought, an aim without a target. And it is this scandalous movement which produces the rarest quality of an air. This is the paradox: how can one have an <i>intelligent air</i> without thinking about anything intelligent, just by looking into this piece of black plastic? It is because the look, eliding the vision, seems held back by something interior . . . the Look is always potentially crazy: it is the effect of truth . . . effect of madness.

The mastery in Gay's portrait of Eliot lies in capturing the sober atmosphere and character of a place&#x02014;through the tonal quality of the print, and through significant detail&#x02014;if, in Barthes's terms, there is a <i>punctum</i> in this portrait, which Mark Strand has defined as "something in the photograph, a detail, that stings or pierces the viewer into an emotional reassessment of what he has seen," it is that half-inserted thumb in Eliot's pristine waistcoat pocket, which simultaneously arouses in the viewer a sense of assurance and absence.<sup><a name="REF119" href="#FOOT119">119</a></sup>

The "true" and "specific virtues" of "the etched line," Malcolm Salaman has written, resides in "its freedom . . . vitality . . . imaginative suggestiveness." Salaman emphasizes the etching method's "wonderful possibilities as a medium for pictorial expression," wherein, "it is not the subject that moves you, but the <i>manner</i> in which it has moved the etcher's temperament to expression," so that "the appeal of etching is through the suggestive convention of the bitten line, and this has a specific beauty and significance which differ from the beauty and significance of a graven line, a pen line or any other line."<sup><a name="REF121" href="#FOOT121">121</a></sup>

Explaining Holloway's etching technique, Robert Meyrick writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
like other etchers of the 1920s and 1930s Holloway sought antique hand-made paper, using ledgers and the blank end-papers from old books&#x02014;believing no modern mould-made substitute can imitate the subtlety of colour and tone of old papers . . . While there is a wide range of different commercially prepared etching inks available, Holloway prefers to hand grind his own black ink . . . the pigments are mixed with medium strength copper-plate oil to one part Frankfurt Black, one part Heavy French Black and two parts Light French Black. A small quality of burnt umber is added to warm the black&#x02014;the amount dependant on taste and the requirement of the individual print . . . Almost all his pre-war plates were printed on his Kimber press . . . All prints are from copper plates . . . With few exceptions all have been printed by him. Preliminary drawings, mostly to the same size as the intended plate, were prepared for many of the prints.<sup><a name="REF124" href="#FOOT124">124</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In a letter to the author, Holloway explained the genesis of the pencil drawing that was the basis for his etching of Eliot (<a href="#0"> 10</a>): 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I made this in 1934&#x02014;about the time of "Murder in the Cathedral." The actual sitting for the preliminary drawing was arranged through Herbert Read whose portrait I had already drawn and etched. The sitting was held in Eliot's office at Faber and Faber in Russell Square. . . . I don't think I had any difficulty with the drawing&#x02014;Eliot was a very good sitter&#x02014;he kept still!<sup><a name="REF125" href="#FOOT125">125</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In conversation, Holloway also said: "I spent the afternoon with Eliot . . . that was not very long . . . I was twenty at the time and at the Slade School of Art . . . Eliot was a very serious man . . . we talked while I was doing the portrait."<sup><a name="REF126" href="#FOOT126">126</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Holloway is as masterful as Rembrandt (who was a great influence on his art) in the fine hatching and stippling he creates for the contours, shadings, and subtle tonal gradations on Eliot's etched face. Here Eliot's mouth, chin, and forehead and eyes attain more expression and temperament&#x02014;and it is specifically the precision of the bitten line which creates the noted gravity of the face in the etched portrait suggesting that Holloway has not etched a <i>subject</i> but a <i>motive</i> (<i>GPE,</i> 5). The innate "vitality, imaginative suggestiveness" and "spiritual" nature of a great etching, in Salaman's terms, are all evident in Eliot's etched portrait. Only in the etching does one feel that the artist has furtively approached the complexity of an individual consciousness obliquely translated through a face&#x02014;as one might observe in a portrait by Rembrandt.
</p>

<p>
Underlying the etched line is the subconscious knowledge that the artist has mastered his craft with enough confidence and restraint to submit his hand to permanence&#x02014;unlike pencil or paint, the etching needle creates non-erasable lines. Through the "suggestive convention of the bitten line," Holloway creates in this portrait of Eliot, a concentration which one sees only in great art, one which reflects a certain aspect of consciousness in the sitter which the artist simultaneously aims to recreate in the viewer. If, as Salaman believed, "the true etcher . . . is always recognizable . . . by the eloquence of his reticence," Holloway may be considered to be a true etcher (<i>GPE,</i> 6).

<p class="noIndent">
"Magic, make-believe, beauty, adventure . . . fun" is how one viewer summarizes the art of Angus McBean.<sup><a name="REF128" href="#FOOT128">128</a></sup>  With his candid dictum, "People want to be beautiful" (<i>AM,</i> 18), he was deemed "a celestial salesman" (<i>AM,</i> 13). McBean says: "everyone wants to look their best in a photograph . . . I never printed or published a picture which [sitters] did not pass.<sup><a name="REF129" href="#FOOT129">129</a></sup>  More acutely, McBean would admit: "The way that a portrait photographer sees his subject has very little to do with truth anyway" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 12). Adrian Woodhouse sees the "ambition" and "dynamic" of McBean's art as the "power of illusion" and the "desire to cheat . . . trick . . . deceive . . . show off what the camera could do" (<i>AM,</i> 7).
</p>

<p>
His first fame was as a modeller of theatrical masks and props. He became, in his own words, "the number one theatre photographer in one of the great periods of English theatre."<sup><a name="REF130" href="#FOOT130">130</a></sup>  McBean's celebrity sitters include Vivienne Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Lawrence Olivier, and Richard Burton. In the 1950s and 1960s he photographed Tommy Steel, Motown stars, the Beatles, and Maria Callas for record sleeves.
</p>

<p>
Born in Wales, McBean became an assistant in the studio of Hugh Cecil in London in 1934, where he "learned all about negatives . . . Those marvellous 12 x 10 glass plates, specially coated with a matt-surfaced emulsion could be drawn on, like handmade crayon paper, with a ordinary pencil" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 14).
</p>

<p>
Woodhouse says that McBean's "camera is its own theatre . . . he is in complete control of all its subjects . . . he commands them to act for his cameras and provides them with the sets in which to perform" (<i>AM,</i> 15). McBean's forte was surrealistic portraits of celebrities. In one, Vivien Leigh is posed as the goddess Aurora, encased in a plaster of Paris gown to which he had wired artificial clouds. Magazines like the <i>Tatler</i> commissioned McBean's surreal photographs of stars such as Mae West, Martha Graham, and Katherine Hepburn. McBean explained his own interest in the surreal: "The new romantic movement has touched all the arts . . . Artists, . . . baffled by the illogic of the times in which we live, have been forced beyond realism into the surreal world of the subconscious mind" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 20).
</p>

<p>
McBean's teasing photograph of Eliot looking intently through a viewer of glass negatives is a play on the relationship between artist, subject, viewer, and the props of photography (<a href="#1"> 11</a>). McBean's prints are made of a dramatic, smooth painterly chiaroscuro of velvety blacks, greys, and white. He refers to the "silver in the paper . . . the richness of the half-tones . . . the warm, rich flesh tones" of the old black-and-white printing paper he used (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 8). Woodhouse observes that he:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . relies on lighting . . . on instinctive understanding of the human head . . . its sculptural possibilities . . . He knows automatically the illusions that can be created by different lighting&#x02014;how to enlarge the eyes, broaden the forehead, reduce the nose, carve away a cheekbone or chin . . . Because he could draw on faces with light and shadow . . . McBean specialised . . . in the close-up; the face as mask or icon.

In McBean's 1953 studio photograph of Eliot (<a href="#2"> 12</a>), the poet smiles faintly, his sixty-five year old face is smoothed with airbrushed away wrinkles and skin a-sheen perfection&#x02014;in Roland Barthe's words on Greta Garbo, what we see here is a "deified" "face-object." Barthes says a <i>mask</i> "is but a sum of lines," and a <i>face</i> "on the contrary, is . . . thematic harmony."<sup><a name="REF131" href="#FOOT131">131</a></sup>  McBean's genius may reside in his fusion of the eternal, archetypal, dramatic with the harmonious&#x02014;indeed, as great poets, philosophers, photographers, and painters have taught us, is not the bright obverse of the word, mirror, mask, lens, and canvas&#x02014;darkness and mortality? Eduardo Cavada says "The conjunction of death and the photographed is the very principle of photographic certitude: the photograph is a cemetery."<sup><a name="REF132" href="#FOOT132">132</a></sup>  Barthes says photography symbolizes a certain horror because it "certifies that the corpse is alive, <i>as corpse</i>: it is the living image of the dead thing" (<i>CL,</i> 78-79).

<p class="noIndent">
"Fluent," "synoptic," and "dramatic" in her style as a portraitist in pastel, pencil, and ink&#x02014;Jean Shepeard was of Romanian origin and raised in England.<sup><a name="REF134" href="#FOOT134">134</a></sup>  She first studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, but her life was divided between drawing and theatre. She studied at the <i>Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts</i> in 1925 and performed in plays at leading venues with stars like John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, Peggy Ashcroft, and Sibyl Thorndike. The first of her many film appearances was in 1939 in <i>Inquest</i> and in 1942 she appeared in <i>Thunder Rock</i> with Michael Redgrave. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>Art Quarterly</i> of 1957 remarked: "Shepeard is not a professional artist in the sense that she has never bothered to earn her living by drawing or painting . . . But always there was the constant use of the sketch-book and cont&#x000E9; chalk."<sup><a name="REF135" href="#FOOT135">135</a></sup>  Many of her portraits are drawn from the theatrical milieu: J.B. Priestly, Peggy Ashcroft, Vanessa Bell, and Jean Marsh. In a review of the play <i>Anna Christie,</i> a critic says that Shepeard gave a "performance notable both for 'sincerity' and 'emotional power'" &#x02014;characteristics which also define the nature of her portrait art.<sup><a name="REF136" href="#FOOT136">136</a></sup>  A reviewer of her 1931 exhibition, referring to "her remarkable portrait heads in chalk," writes: ". . . there is a young artist here, whose work, unfledged though it is, seems to be pointing in the right direction . . . she has urgently something to say and at her best draws with great nervous vigour and amazing emotional power. Her work is alive, sensitive and stimulating."<sup><a name="REF137" href="#FOOT137">137</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Shepeard exhibited drawings and pastels in the painter Francis Bacon's second exhibition in May 1930 in his Queensbury Mews studio where Bacon showed paintings and modernist rugs and furniture; she also made a drawing of Bacon.<sup><a name="REF138" href="#FOOT138">138</a></sup>  Her early experimentations in portrait drawings show an uncanny affinity to the famous, kinetical, blurred style of Bacon's later paintings and, tantalisingly, may suggest Shepeard as a formative influence on Bacon's art. These early experimentations by Shepeard are of unidentified res and Doreen Kern says that she simply drew faces that fascinated her.<sup><a name="REF139" href="#FOOT139">139</a></sup>  A critic wrote that her "drawings of heads show great sensibility and beauty of line and are, in their bold unhesitating treatment full of vigour and character."<sup><a name="REF140" href="#FOOT140">140</a></sup>

In 1928 she had joined the Emotionist Group, founded by Royal Academician, R. O. Dunlop, consisting of painters, musicians, philosophers, poets, and actors.<sup><a name="REF141" href="#FOOT141">141</a></sup>  In the same year she exhibited at the Redfern Gallery with the leading artists Augustus John, Lucian Pissaro, Paul Nash, and Eric Gill. She also exhibited with Vanessa Bell, Ben Nicholson, Jacob Epstein, R. O. Dunlop, and Frank Dobson in Bloomsbury at the Modern Picture Library.<sup><a name="REF142" href="#FOOT142">142</a></sup>  She seems to have given up exhibiting around 1933-1934 when her stage appearances became numerous, but continued to draw and paint in seclusion to the end of her life. 
</p>

<p>
Shepeard's retrospective Primrose Hill Gallery exhibition of 30 October to 12 November 1995 contained drawings of many well-known artists, actors and writers including T. S. Eliot.
</p>

<p>
As in many of her other portrait sketches Shepeard probably did not have her subject Eliot sit for her. As someone on the fringes of Bloomsbury artistic life, she would have been aware of Eliot's literary reputation. Shepeard's drawing of the poet is a black pencil sketch of the head in side profile (<a href="#3"> 13</a>). The strong, bold lines and contours of the head creates a sculptural feel to the portrait&#x02014;the over-sized enclosed fist has the monumental bulk of a Picasso or a Matisse limb. In a pensive or weary posture, Eliot rests his head in his hand. He wears his round black-rimmed glasses and his eyes are closed. The poet's farther eye is absent and the rim of the glasses framing it disembodied which gives Shepeard's drawing an abstract complexity and oriental economy. Shepeard places Eliot in a white collarless shirt that gives the poet the look of a church cleric in deep contemplation. The drawing shows Shepeard's characteristic stylistic features&#x02014;a dramatic, shrewd, vigorous, intensely minimal pencil style which focuses the viewer's eye on the subject's fundamental features and the mind upon a contemplation of deeper nature.

E. McKnight Kauffer (1890-1954)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<h4 class="bHead">
<!--_bHead-->
T. S. Eliot, Black &amp; White Photograph, dated: London 1939, King's College Archive, Cambridge.<sup><a name="REF143" href="#FOOT143">143</a></sup>
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
E. McKnight Kauffer was born in Montana where he spent his early years working in factories. He "joined a travelling theatre stock company as an assistant scene painter," then studied at the Art Institute of Chicago for six months but "rebelled against the system of Art education," instead "siding with the Post-Impressionists."<sup><a name="REF144" href="#FOOT144">144</a></sup>  After working for museums in Munich and Paris until the outbreak of war, Kauffer moved to England where he painted until 1921 and became well-known among artists and even national res for his uniquely "modern" poster art. His production of "the first and only Cubist poster design in England&#x02014;a flight of birds" gained him the recognition of Winston Churchill, who approached him to design a new flag for the Royal Air Force.<sup><a name="REF145" href="#FOOT145">145</a></sup>  Kauffer even makes a cameo appearance in Evelyn Waugh's <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>; Charles Ryder's Oxford rooms "proudly" display "a reproduction of Van Gogh's <i>Sunflowers,</i>" "a screen painted by Roger Fry," and "a poster by McKnight Kauffer."<sup><a name="REF146" href="#FOOT146">146</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Writers particularly admired the artistry and modernist innovation of his posters. Aldous Huxley notes Kauffer's rejection of advertising's reliance on "symbols" for "sex and money" in favor of "symbols" that "stand for the particular things which are at the moment under consideration," "thus . . . forms symbolical of space, loneliness and distance . . . advertise a holiday resort where prospects are wide and houses few." He praised Kauffer's "affinity with all artists who ever aimed at expressiveness through simplification, distortion [and] transposition . . . especially with the Post-Impressionists [and] Cubists": his aim was "to render the facts of nature in such a way that the rendering shall be, not a copy, but a simplified, formalised and more expressive symbol of the things represented."<sup><a name="REF147" href="#FOOT147">147</a></sup>  And Marianne Moore's allusions to the "consummate elegance," "compression," and poetic attributes of his poster art recall those aspects of her own poetry: "The language of blacks and grays is color in the sense that Chinese brush masterpieces are color. . . . We have here a poetry of synonyms like 'the immediate meaning and possible meaning' of poetry, as where a Mexican hat has the form of a plane . . . verifying Democritus' axiom, 'Compression is the first grace of style.'"<sup><a name="REF148" href="#FOOT148">148</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Kauffer's sensitivity to modern movements in literature as well as art endeared him to modernist writers such as Eliot. On 24 April 1930, Kauffer wrote to Eliot of <i>Ash Wednesday</i>: "I am moved by the power of these magnificent poems . . . an experience that will become an influence."<sup><a name="REF149" href="#FOOT149">149</a></sup>  And Eliot commented of Kauffer's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> illustrations: "some of them have a quality which reminds me of Chirico."<sup><a name="REF150" href="#FOOT150">150</a></sup>  In June 1959 he wrote to Kauffer's wife that Kauffer's poster work had "made such a deep impression" on his audience and was of "original artistic invention."<sup><a name="REF151" href="#FOOT151">151</a></sup>  Indeed over the course of the late 1920s through the 1940s, Kauffer designed the cover illustration for several of Eliot's "Ariel" poems, "The Journey of the Magi," "A Song for Simeon," "Marina," "Triumphal March," a fragment from the unfinished "Coriolan," and the American edition of <i>Four Quartets.</i> Although Eliot insisted in 1962 that he would "not allow any artist to illustrate [his poems]" because "I want my readers to get their impressions from the words alone and from nothing else," he clearly felt that Kauffer's work profoundly enhanced his aesthetic intentions.<sup><a name="REF152" href="#FOOT152">152</a></sup>  In a speech on Kauffer's poster art to the American Institute of Graphic Art, Eliot described his "mastery of the art of illustration" as "brilliant."<sup><a name="REF153" href="#FOOT153">153</a></sup>  And remarking on an illustration to an edition of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, "including the two terrifying portraits of Poe," Eliot commented: "It is very exceptional for an artist to be able to enlarge our understanding of a poet: I cannot think of a similar instance."<sup><a name="REF154" href="#FOOT154">154</a></sup>  Similarly, Roger Fry congratulated Kauffer on the "tact [and] sensibility" of his illustrations which "manage never to block any of the avenues of the reader's imagination by any too precise image."<sup><a name="REF155" href="#FOOT155">155</a></sup>  And in 1930 Eliot told Kauffer: "Yours is the only kind of illustration that I can endure."<sup><a name="REF156" href="#FOOT156">156</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Kauffer was not a professional photographer but one can also see in his photographs, what Marianne Moore notes in his poster art, an "instinctiveness," a "logic of sensibility," "shadows . . . as arresting as objects," and a "focussing scrutiny" upon the subject.<sup><a name="REF157" href="#FOOT157">157</a></sup>  His subjects include details of haystacks, old abandoned farm machinery, carts in snow, sheep, swans, farmers at work, a hat pinned to a tree, and gnarled tree

Among his still lifes are the cast of the head of Michaelangelo's <i>David</i> donned with sunglasses, painted eyelashes, and a teardrop in the surrealistic style of Man Ray; the butt ends of cigarettes in an ash tray; fragments of a sculptured hand holding a rose; and several disembodied sculpted heads resembling Chirico.
</p>

<p>
His portrait photograph of Eliot was taken at his home, as a letter from Eliot to Kauffer of February 1939, suggests:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Thank you very much for the photographs. I think they are excellent . . . the only fault in mine are the Charlie Chaplin moustache (due I suppose, to the lighting) and not having bathed my eyes&#x02014;and the next time you photograph your male guests at 11 <small class="caps">P.M.</small> or so you ought give them [<i>sic</i>] a rub over first with your electric razor, that is, if you use such a powerful lens.<sup><a name="REF158" href="#FOOT158">158</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Indeed Kauffer's sharp-focussed powerful lens forces the spectator to scrutinize the intimacies of Eliot's brightly lit face (<a href="#4"> 14</a>). The characteristics of Kauffer's poster art that Marianne Moore noted also distinguish his monochromatic photograph of the poet: "compression," "consummate elegance," "a poetry of synonyms." Further, the portrait demonstrates Kauffer's aesthetic sensibility which, in Huxley's words, "render the facts of nature in such a way that the rendering shall be, not a copy, but a simplified, formalized and more expressive symbol of the things represented." One can say of Kauffer's photography, as he claimed of all good design, that "in spite of the swiftness with which it is made and used, study and experience are needed to make it the genuine art it proves itself to be," and there is, "a principle of rightness about it that only an artist understands."<sup><a name="REF159" href="#FOOT159">159</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
An American by birth, George Platt Lynes made his first trip to Europe in 1925 where he met such artists as Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, and Russian Surrealist painter, Pavel Tchelitchew in France. He began photographing in 1927, when he also opened a bookshop in New Jersey and published the writings of Stein, Ren&#x000E9; Crevel, and Hemingway, editions that included art illustrations by Cocteau and Tchelitchew. In 1933 Lynes opened a studio in New York, where he became known for portraits of personalities in the arts, erotic imaginative shots of male nudes, and elegant fashion studies for haute couture magazines. Lynes's photographs appeared in the <i>Dada and Surrealism</i> exhibition organized by the New York <i>Museum of Modern Art</i> in 1936. His subjects included Gertude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Edith Sitwell, George Balanchine, W. H. Auden, E. M. Forster, e e cummings, Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall, Colette, Aldous Huxley, Andr&#x000E9; Gide, Igor Stravinsky, and Thomas Mann. 
</p>

<p>
Aesthetically, his photography strove to encompass the dominant French intellectual movements pervading the arts in the 1920s. Art historian Stephen Prokopoff remarks that Lynes's "mythological" photographs "brought together into a completely 

<b></b>

individual amalgam the . . . poetical, symbolical classicism prevalent in France during the 1920s in painting, poetry, music [and] theatre . . . that continued in Balanchine's ballet theatre in the 1930s."<sup><a name="REF161" href="#FOOT161">161</a></sup>  And because Lynes's images were "cleansed of chance incident" and "smoothed into geometric forms that are elements in larger structural conrations," Prokopoff notes, they conveyed the "influence of the magical neoclassicism that dominated the arts in France in the 1920s" ("GPL").
</p>

<p>
Lynes was particularly attentive to lighting. Prokopoff elaborates on "the eloquence of lighting that is fundamental to Lynes' art," one "in which character is defined by contrasting tonalities. Lynes' appreciation of the drama created by light was enhanced by . . . artfully staged emphasis . . . the heightened reality of the theatre . . . seemed to have truly formed Lynes' sense of the expressivity of illumination" ("GPL").
</p>

<p>
Lynes's photographs of Eliot were published in the British <i>Vogue</i> of 1947 and in the American <i>Vogue</i> of 1948, the latter with the caption "T. S. Eliot, Nobel Prize Winner" and the following narrative:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
After thirty-one years of influence in which fame and a little shock were mixed, T. S. Eliot joins the long list of Nobel Prize winners. Scholars and critics for years have written and fought about his poetry, his four plays, his essays with their "magisterial stare" . . . Inevitably he has been a mental pressure on the work of other poets; to many, <i>The Waste Land,</i> with its controversial imagery, was a major power in the search for psychological realism. His poetry, simple in words . . . is profound in meaning and complex in references, often rooted deep in world literature.<sup><a name="REF162" href="#FOOT162">162</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Lynes's portraits of Eliot reflect the key terms of this description: magisterial, mental pressure, psychological realism, simple, profound, complex in reference. Lynes took a series of black and white shots of Eliot in a single sitting in 1947. One photograph places the focus intensely on the subject, situated in a vacant room, containing only an empty table and a chair and a large window which offers no view to the portrait's spectator (<a href="#5"> 15</a>). Eliot is seated by the triangular edge of a table and looks out of the window. The psychological tension in the portrait is palpable. Shielded from the world's attention, Eliot gazes intently out of a window, between his fingers a burning cigarette, photographically frozen in time. This solitary, contained re could be waiting for and contemplating something or nothing; the dazzling light from the window suggests, ambiguously, effacement or spirituality. The use of light in this portrait also illustrates Beaton's point that Lynes had "an extraordinary talent for using spotlights to bring out the incandescent quality of human skin . . . 'He painted with lights'" (<i>MI,</i> 230).
</p>

<p>
Lynes's portrait of Eliot is as fastidious and refined as Eliot's suit, manifesting the precise attitude of decorous self-containment that characterizes Lynes's aesthetic of the photographs and their subject. As Prokopoff comments:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Further, Lynes's fierce formalism illustrates Barthes's point concerning the verity of the photograph itself: however much the viewer desires to "discover" the "being" of a self, or an "essence" in a photograph, its "air (expression, the look)," is "unanalyzable." It exists purely as "evidence," and to "prove" or "reject" or "decompose" it is to "deviate from the Photograph" (<i>CL,</i> 107).

Introduction: Eliot, Modernism, and the Nineties
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
One of the ongoing concerns of Eliot studies, at least since the 1980s, has been to explore the increasingly apparent "disparity," to quote Colleen Lamos, between the literary progenitors that Eliot acknowledged and the res in Decadent England and America (principally Walter Pater, Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde, and Walt Whitman) whose influence he passively or actively "suppressed."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Nearly a hundred years after Eliot's emergence as a poet, we are only beginning to reconstitute his temperamental and intellectual connections with the generation that shaped his earliest verse. 
</p>

<p>
Readers have turned most recently to examining the sexual politics underlying Eliot's reluctance to speak about his Decadent heritage, but not always in a way that does justice to the complex relations between life and art. Take the striking story of Eliot's secondary residence starting in 1923 in Burleigh Mansions on Charing Cross Road. According to Virgina Woolf, Clive Bell, and the Sitwells, Eliot took to wearing green face powder during private parties in the rooms&#x02014;according to Osbert Sitwell, face powder "the colour of forced lily-of-the-valley."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Since the color green was a common emblem of the aesthetic movement&#x02014;as for instance in Oscar Wilde's subtitle ("A Study in Green") to his sketch of the Pater-like author Wainewright in the essay "Pen, Pencil and Poison"&#x02014;Eliot's makeup would seem to signify some kind of willful effort to identify himself with the culture of the nineties.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But must we conclude with Carole Seymour-Jones in her recent biography of Vivien Eliot that the powder was in fact 

<b></b>

a statement of Eliot's sexual preference and that the Burleigh House pied-&#x000E0;-terre was a venue for homosexual assignations&#x02014;"the hub of [Eliot's] secret life"?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Seymour-Jones, after all, offers no evidence beyond the face powder, and Peter Ackroyd, who first discovered Sitwell's memoir, argues that the powder was merely a gesture of solidarity with Eliot's artist friends. ("It is significant that the only people who noticed his make-up, and probably the only ones in whose company he wore it, were writers and artists . . . wearing face powder made him look more modern, more interesting, a poet rather than a bank official."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> ) 
</p>

<p>
The public/private valence of Eliot's gesture, furthermore, is as unclear as its symbolism. Did Eliot intend the face powder as a public statement? Or, given the short-lived and private nature of the evenings, did it represent a half-censored rebellion against his own social reserve? The latter is more likely, as is the possibility that Eliot's relations to the 1890s were less a matter of conscious strategy&#x02014;a willingness to "traffic in . . . homoerotic rhetoric in a private context [but] not a public forum"&#x02014;than the expression of a genuine and unresolved personal conflict.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Since the 1980s, though, literary and cultural historians have glossed Eliot's relation to the 1890s by explicating his elaborately constructed prose style, with its plainspoken display of rational control, as the calculated censorship of a foresworn emotional expressivity. First Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in 1988 explained Eliot's exaggerated rationality as a way of resisting the growing influence of literary women at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, Cassandra Laity, Colleen Lamos, Ann Ardis, and others have contextualized it as a response to what Richard Dellamora has called the "crisis of sexual identity and male privilege" that started in the generation of Pater.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Most of this criticism assumes, in Ann Ardis's words, that Eliot evaded identification with the 1890s by a "deliberate erasure" , and Ardis herself specifies that Eliot's criticism deliberately transformed gendered discussions of self and poetry into a "highly abstract ration" of literary genealogy .
</p>

<p>
This promising work, I think, needs to be qualified in several respects. As I have argued elsewhere, while it seems reasonable to argue that modernist poetics represents a gendered reaction to post-symbolism's emphasis on the poetry of the body, one should recognize that the definitive move in that reaction took the form not, as Ardis suggests, of a public turn against Decadent softness in art and life, but of the echoing consequences of imagism's instinctive and fundamental redefinition of rhythm and image as expressions of thought.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  More pertinently here I would add that by overemphasizing Eliot's deliberate suppression of the 1890s, we blur not only the complexity of his response but the way the prose of the English Decadents also deployed masculine markers to hedge the issue of gender, and thus we further exaggerate the break between the Decadent and the modernist generations. In this perspective, Eliot's style only sustains his predecessor's ambivalence. In his own criticism, Wilde frequently employs the rhetoric of manliness to criticize literary Decadence, as he does in "The Rise of Historical Criticism," an essay steeped in the authority of reason and science. There Wilde dissociates himself specifically from "that refined effeminacy, that overstrained gracefulness of attitude" that infects "the sphere of history" in Euripides and 

<b></b>

Swinburne<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  and praises Polybius by noting that "perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and modern history which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of rationalism" as Polybius's remarks on the decay of population (<i>CW,</i> 1226). 
</p>

<p>
Is it possible that by overstating and then discounting the modernists' conscious dissociation from their predecessors, we may now in a strange way actually be replicating the modernist myth of a break from the 1890s rather than clarifying their genuinely conflicted relations with aestheticism? Eliot's residual emotional ties to the 1890s, I argue in part four of this essay, continued to be a source of discomfort and distress well into the years of his fame and maturity, and his account of the chasm between himself and Wilde's generation was a central instance of that distress.
</p>

<h3 class="aHead">

Eliot and Wilde?
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
I begin by reexamining Eliot's relation to Oscar Wilde, whom Eliot specifically acknowledged as the leading re of English Decadence. Without diminishing the temperamental differences between Eliot and Wilde or disregarding the differences between their attitudes toward nature, morality, and religion, I want to call attention to ways in which Eliot derived some of his most famous pronouncements from Wilde. I then wish to explore several insufficiently interrogated accounts in which Eliot fixed the origins of his own literary genealogy in the moment of Wilde's disappearance from the literary scene.
</p>

<p>
How much did Oscar Wilde mean to the young Eliot? Wilde was not, we may safely say, one of those "dead authors" with whom Eliot openly acknowledged a "profound kinship, or rather . . . a peculiar personal intimacy." ("The usefulness of such a passion is various. . . . We may not be great lovers; but if we had a genuine affair with a real poet of any degree we have acquired a monitor to avert us when we are not in love. . . . We do not imitate, we are changed; and our work is the work of the changed man; we have not borrowed, we have been quickened, and we become bearers of a tradition."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> ) Nor was he the kind of technical innovator who answers to Eliot's comment that besides the debts of "capital importance one has other debts, innumerable debts, to poets, of another kind. There are poets who have been at the back of one's mind, or perhaps consciously there, when one has had some particular problem to settle, for which something they have written suggests the method."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Or are these things so very clear after all? It now seems difficult to read Eliot's just quoted remarks about art, love, and even "tradition" without noticing their Wildean erotics and their equally Wildean delight in paradox. Nor, as the work of Christopher Ricks, Ronald Schuchard, and Richard Shusterman has shown, can one completely dismiss the likelihood that, before his life-changing encounter with Jules Laforgue, Wilde and the 1890s had already impressed an indelible mark on the shaping of Eliot's early poetic self. 
</p>

<p>
Certainly, Eliot as a young man was familiar with Wilde's work. A letter from his mother lists Wilde's "[The Ballad of] Reading Gaol" as one of the books he carefully stored away when he left St. Louis, and his own letter to Scofield Thayer recalls their 

<b></b>

time at Oxford together, when Thayer lived in Magdalen (Wilde's college) and affected Wilde's manners.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The latter reminds us of how recently  Wilde had left Oxford and how strong his shadow yet remained. Eliot, on his part, reminds Thayer of the latter's reputation as a "connoisseur of puberty and lilies" and recalls the bond between them by quoting by heart from Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>: "'To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!'"<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Nor, though Eliot once described <i>Dorian Gray</i> as perhaps "perfect rubbish," was his ability to produce a passage of the book from memory out of character.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Annotating Eliot's poetic notebook, "Inventions of the March Hare," Christopher Ricks points to more than a dozen recollections of Wilde in Eliot's early verse, including five to the "Ballad of Reading Gaol" and eight to <i>Dorian Gray,</i> with many of the latter falling in crucial moments either in the excised "Pervigilium" section of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" or in the equally important early poem "The Love Song of St. Sebastian."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The most striking resemblance may be to this passage from chapter seven of <i>Dorian Gray,</i> which resonates through a half-dozen of Eliot's major early poems, above all in "Prufrock" and "Prufrock's Pervigilium": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He remembered wandering through dimly-lit streets, past gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon doorsteps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The sum of these poetic recollections point to Wilde as an important source for the strain of psycho-sexual-spiritual distress in Eliot's published and unpublished early verse. Referring to the 1890s more generally, Ronald Schuchard goes farther and contends that the 1890s' "admixture of religious and sexual emotion" represents Eliot's real <i>point de depart</i> and that Eliot later covered his links with the 1890s by stressing affinities with Baudelaire rather than with the English followers of Baudelaire he read as a young man. The impact of Wilde and his circle on Eliot, Schuchard holds, was therefore "more substantive than aesthetic;" his "deepest emotional affinity was with the English poets" and he shared their "morbid fascination with the conflicts of desire and beatitude, body and soul, flesh and Absolute." Little wonder, he continues, that Eliot later affirmed that the poets of the 1890s are "'nearer to us than the intervening generation . . . the fact that they were interested in Baudelaire indicates [our genuine] community.'"<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<h3 class="aHead">

Wilde and Eliot's Poetics
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
It is true, of course, that Eliot's poetic recollections of the 1890s do not always concern Wilde, and that in his poetry he may have turned more frequently to other English Decadents, especially Swinburne and Lionel Johnson. When we examine to Eliot's critical prose though, Wilde's significance seems preeminent. Eliot's borrowings here extend well beyond his early aestheticist stress on poetry "as poetry and not 

<b></b>

another thing" and crucially include an emphasis on the poet's self-conscious modernity; a deliberate and provocative turn away from emotional sincerity and its allied notions of the natural and the real; the championing of impersonality and poetic artifice; and a notion of tradition that while apparently highlighting literary continuity in fact strongly stresses poetic revolution.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot read Wilde's essays carefully and expressed his admiration on a number of occasions. In the course of lectures he gave on Victorian literature for the London County Council for the fall of 1917 he devoted a full lecture to the aestheticism of Pater and Wilde and during that year he conducted tutorials for the same authority on "Modern English Literature" that included a major section on "The 'Nineties.'" The latter featured Wilde as the first among equals, required that the students read his critical essays in <i>Intentions</i> as well as <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> and <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>, and recommended for supplementary reading Arthur Ransome's intelligent <i>Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study,</i> which had been published just five years before.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Then, in a 1922 essay discussed at length below, Eliot went as far as to write that the "best of Wilde" was to be found in the critical volume <i>Intentions.</i><sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Still later, in his teaching notes for English 26 ("Contemporary English Literature, 1890 to the Present Time"), which Eliot taught to undergraduates at Harvard in the Spring of 1933 (and for which he likely elaborated his 1917 lecture notes), Eliot made recurrent (though not always complimentary) reference to Wilde, calling him in the first lecture the "<i>chef d'&#x000E9;cole</i>" of the 1890s, and in lecture 4 praising the "Wilde group" for reacting against Victorian association of art with social causes and moral teaching. (Intriguingly, Eliot either suppressed or never produced the notes for a scheduled lecture that would have covered the aesthetic movement. His Harvard notes indicate but do not include a lecture 3 between lecture 2's discussion of Kipling and lecture 4's treatment of the Fabians in the generation that followed Wilde.)<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Given Eliot's well-documented attentions to Wilde though, it is still startling to be reminded of how many of the fundamental formulations of Eliot's poetics can be traced to <i>Intentions</i>' central essays&#x02014;"The Decay of Lying" and "The Critic as Artist." Consider the assertion so often advanced by Eliot and also Pound, that the poet first must identify what the modern age lacks and then supply it from the style of a different time or place&#x02014;the famous "historical sense," which "involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence" and which "makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity" (<i>SW,</i> 49). It was the historical sense, Eliot had written the year before, that not only allows Pound's work to get "the spirit of Proven&#x000E7;al, or of Chinese, or of Anglo-Saxon, as the case may be," but to have perceived "what <i>they</i> have that <i>we</i> want;" such a sense is only obtainable by "an organised view of the whole course of European poetry from Homer."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Behind Eliot's idea ultimately stands Baudelaire's "The Painter of Modern Life," which holds that the ideal of timeless beauty has been exploded and that the artist now understands that every age must recreate beauty in a new "historical envelope." It is the first duty of the modern artist, Baudelaire contends, to identify those formal conventions that are no longer tenable and to invent new ones suitable to the age. But

since this requires understanding the histories of style, it also means that art belongs not to the amateur but to the connoisseur-practitioner who can understand the "form[s] of modernity."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In 1918 and 1919 though, Eliot did not derive these ideas directly from Baudelaire, but from Wilde, whose "The Rise of Historical Criticism" traces the rise of our "historical sense" (<i>CW,</i> 1227), and whose "The Critic as Artist" concurs with Baudelaire that the first duty of the modern artist is the critical task of defining for his own generation the form of modern beauty (the "highest criticism . . . criticises not merely the individual work of art, but Beauty itself") (<i>CW,</i> 1127). 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's praise of the poet's "historical sense" has two parts. The first involves an assertion that the artist is a critic before he is a creator. This idea forms the core of Wilde's "The Critic as Artist," which, as Lawrence Danson notes, develops it by reversing Matthew Arnold's "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time" , which had praised the critical character of his age but also lamented that modern criticism has stifled artistic creation (<i>WI,</i> 128-9). Wilde signposted his reversal when he first published the essay in the July and September 1890 issues of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> under the pseudo-Arnoldian title, "The True Function and Value of Criticism." In the words of Wilde's mouthpiece, Gilbert, the essay argues that "Creation is always behind the age. It is Criticism that leads us." (<i>CW,</i> 1154). Gilbert then explains that "Without the critical faculty, there is no artistic creation at all worthy of the name" (<i>CW,</i> 1118) and that "the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple . . . is always the result of the most self-consciousness" (<i>CW,</i> 1118). It is these last passages that Eliot echoes in 1924 in a pseudo-Arnoldian essay of his own, "The Function of Criticism," which replicates Wilde's argument: "Matthew Arnold . . . overlooks the capital importance of criticism in the work of creation itself;" "[no] great artist is an unconscious artist."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
The second part of Eliot's account of the artist's "historical sense" also comes from Wilde, this time from "The Rise of Historical Criticism." Wilde explains that historical discourse goes beyond underlining our differences with the past and emphasizes the method of "comparison" (<i>CW,</i> 1240) that identifies the past's contemporaneity. Wilde's essay, drawing on Hegel and resisting the tendency of nineteenth-century historicism to emphasize the past's singularity&#x02014;what Eliot calls the "pastness" of the past&#x02014;holds that the historical sense is in fact part of "that complex working towards freedom" which may be described as part of our own "revolt against authority" (<i>CW,</i> 1198). It was based on such assertions that Pound and Eliot placed historical perception at the heart of the contemporary poet's critical modernity. 
</p>

<p>
Wilde's anticipation of Eliot's modernism, moreover, runs deeper still. In Wilde's wake, Eliot challenges the two most important premises common to both Romanticism and realism&#x02014;that art must grow out of spontaneous, "natural" feeling, and that art should imitate the truth of nature around us. Tellingly, both writers in their moments of greatest seriousness engage with reality within discussions of realist literature. Regarding Wilde, Lawrence Danson usefully identifies the debate about literary realism&#x02014;and especially about the naturalist Zola&#x02014;as "the contemporary polemical context in which ["The Decay of Lying"] is to be understood," and quotes Linda Nochlin 

<b></b>

to remind us that "although the Realist refrained from moral comment in his work, his whole attitude towards art implied a moral commitment, to the values of truth, honesty, and sincerity"(<i>WI,</i> 47). Against this, Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" holds that realist art is stifling, because it bases its portraits on the Victorian's sham, outdated, and potentially suffocating notions of that "dreadful universal thing called human nature" (<i>CW,</i> 1076). Wilde's alternative to this "unimaginative realism" is an "imaginative reality" of the kind Swinburne found in Balzac's novels, which "reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades"(<i>WI,</i> 55).
</p>

<p>
Wilde's comments lead inescapeably to Eliot's jazz play, <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i>, and spur Eliot's unfaltering attempts to discredit realist drama. Hence Eliot insists in his 1919 essay, "Ben Jonson," that Jonson's drama succeeds because it grows out of a poetry "of the surface"(<i>SW,</i> 105). It is "not human life" Eliot tells us, that informs Jonson's characters, "but it is energy of which human life is only another variety"(<i>SW,</i> 109). His "art of caricature" involves, therefore, "a brutality, a lack of sentiment, a polished surface, a handling of large bold designs in brilliant colours" (SW 120-1). Eliot's animus against "sentiment" here reprises Wilde's dislike of "human nature." Abhorring the lies we accept as "reality," it opposes to the realist theatre's presentation of those lies Jonson's purely imaginative and "titanic show" (<i>SW,</i> 121).
</p>

<p>
The family resemblance between Eliot and Wilde can also be discovered in their responses to the realist assumption that art imitates the truth of a nature that is to be found all around us. In the other major essay in <i>Intentions</i>, "The Decay of Lying," Wilde devotes himself to disproving this "truth" by exposing the artificiality of everything we assume to be natural. In the dialogue, Vivian famously holds that far from art imitating nature, nature imitates art. He argues, as Danson notes, that 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

What we call 'nature' is not natural, not (that is) an inescapable given of existence. Society made what society now worships as the thing which made it: Nature is no great mother who has borne us.

<p>
This line of reasoning, starting with the apparent paradox that art is more natural than nature, would lead Eliot repeatedly to lament the death-like grip of the clich&#x000E9; of the real in contemporary letters. In one case Eliot even adopts Wilde's characteristic form, the philosophical dialogue. In a sketch entitled "Eeldrop and Appleplex" , Appleplex (modelled after Ezra Pound) explains that "the majority of mankind live on paper currency: they use terms which are merely good for so much reality, they never see actual coinage." To this Eliot, in the voice of Eeldrop, replies: "'I should go even further than that . . . The majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man; they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but 

<b></b>

generalized men. They are first of all government officials, or pillars of the church, or trade unionists, or poets, or unemployed; this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes, it is sufficient to themselves for their 'life of the spirit.' Many are not quite real at any moment.'"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although this last citation signals that Eliot could sometimes alter Wilde's premises in fundamental ways, it suggests no irreconcilable break. Wilde's animus against the humanist mystification of uplifting sentiment is grounded in the conviction that "the only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes" ("The Soul of Man Under Socialism," <i>CW,</i> 1194). Less radical than Wilde, Eliot ultimately redefines the "death" and "unreality" that Wilde discovers in the Victorian's repetition of outdated imitations of life in specifically Christian terms, connecting them to a divorce from spiritual life. Nevertheless, Eliot's influential early criticism, insistently focussed on aesthetic issues, seamlessly continues Wilde's deconstruction of humanist clich&#x000E9;s. Also, albeit at lower volume, Eliot continues to appropriate the energies of paradox&#x02014;the motor of Wilde's deconstruction of the "natural" in art and life&#x02014;to erect the teasing reversals at the heart of his poetry and prose: Not only, we remember, do Eliot's core paradoxes include "creation" and "criticism" and "the present" and "the past," but also "life" and "death," "personality and impersonality," "tradition" and the "individual talent," "theft" and "originality," and so on. As in Wilde, all these oppositions target a delusion about "nature" and "reality" that distorts contemporary society and contemporary art.
</p>

<p>
This focus is perhaps easiest to see in relation to Eliot's observation on "impersonality." It is but a short step from Gilbert's denunciation in "The Critic as Artist" of "genuine feeling," from which "all bad poetry springs" (<i>CW,</i> 1148), to Eliot's more famous insistence in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" that "poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality" (<i>SW,</i> 58). In Wilde no less than in Eliot, artifice becomes a tool for discrediting the clich&#x000E9;d sentiment that society regards as "genuine" so that the form of art may recreate feeling in a more intense form. And so in his discussion of poetic theft, Eliot says that "the good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn" (<i>SW,</i> 125). Wilde and then Eliot emphasize stylization in poetry and drama because, apparently more artificial than "natural" speech, it is in fact less tainted by cant and more useful for strong expression. This idea founds the theory of masks propounded by poets from Wilde to W.B. Yeats to Pound to Eliot: speaking through the artifice of a mask, whether simply a second self or a voice distant in space, culture, and time, the poet cleanses himself of those clich&#x000E9;s that masquerade as true emotions and takes on a language that is strange enough to require that it be charged by its aesthetic context to mean anything at all.
</p>

<p>
A more pointed example of the same principle involves poetic theft. Eliot's provocative proclamation that "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal" (<i>SW,</i> 125) reminds us that no less than Wilde he flaunted the way he pieced his writing together from material drawn from others. Wilde too, we remember, was notorious for his so-called

<b></b>

plagiarism. In fact, as Josephine M. Guy has shown, Wilde's most radical originality can be discovered in the way he appropriated other poets' work, especially in individual sections of <i>Intentions</i> and <i>Dorian Gray</i> and even in what appears to be his most innovative creation, <i>Salome</i>.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Working in a culture that would not countenance radical cultural or literary innovation, Guy argues, Wilde's solution was to invoke and then appropriate traditions so flagrantly that his appropriations became marks of his own originality (<i>BA,</i> 142-3). Hence, his apparently outrageous assertion that "it is only the unimaginative who ever invent . . . the true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes, and he annexes everything"(<i>BA,</i> 142).<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Eliot's "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal" shocks us in the same way and for the same reasons&#x02014;because we associate poetry with a false ideal of originality, we assume that nothing that is not "original" can be poetic. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, Eliot's equally paradoxical but more consequential invocation of "tradition" stems from Wildean premises and reveals itself as no less individualistic.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  To assert one's originality by arguing that innovation flows from the voices of one's predecessors has deep roots in Wilde, whose practice explains both the historical context of the assertion and the reaches of its iconoclasm. To again invoke Josephine Guy:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Pater and Morris invoked a tradition in order to disguise or deny the innovative aspects of their thinking; in this sense traditions lent authority to Pater's and Morris's idiosyncratic (and subversive) views about the nature and function of art and literature by appearing to invoke historical precedents for those views. Wilde, on the other hand, uses exactly the same stategy, but he does so in order to <i>exhibit</i> his originality: what Pater and Morris had disguised, he holds up for general inspection. Wilde claimed that in the hands of the 'true' artist all traditions were transformed into something new, and that they had authority only in so far as they 'bore the signature' of the artist who interpreted them. . . . Far from possessing a normative function, for Wilde, traditions were merely the 'suggestion' for an entirely new creation . . . traditions were nothing more than the artist's 'raw materials'; and it was the artist's unique handling of them&#x02014;the extent to which he transformed them through the exercise of his personality and therefore his style&#x02014;which was of primary interest.

The preceding brief account, constructed to bring out Eliot's Wildean foundations, serves I hope at least to suggest the point of the "Wilde" in my title. What remains is to think about how and why "the Possum," while retaining the force of Wilde's core paradoxes, replaced Wilde's provocations with a more Arnoldian style of apparently disinterested prose and obscured Wilde's part in the formation of his modernist vision. 
</p>

<p>
Richard Shusterman would have it that Eliot turned his back on Wilde for reasons of decorum and highmindedness&#x02014;that he "learned from Wilde's bitter experience that even the artist who is alienated and critical of society must make some sort of peace with society," and that he resolved not to "belie the seriousness and importance 

<b></b>

of his thought . . . by too frivolous expression" ("WE," 141). Like most of Eliot's critics, that is, Shusterman assumes that driving both was the kind of serious moral "thought" that caused Eliot to substitute moral life for sexual identity as the principal field on which he opposed nature. On the other hand, the line of what Ann Ardis identifies as the "new modernist studies" suggests that the converse may be true, and that Eliot's "thought" was the product of his policy rather than its cause. Both, however, speak of deliberate strategy and a clear generational change.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  What I have intimated above, and would now like to entertain more seriously, is the possibility that Eliot's apparent social and literary conformity with the discourse of his time marks not a break but a continuity with Wilde's own literary practice of subverting while appearing to conform to the temper of Victorian and post-Victorian Britain, in a context in which the openness of a Francophile cultural avant-garde was simply not permitted.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  I would also like to raise the question of whether Eliot's style might have been, rather than a calculated effort to efface Wildean sexual expression, a not always successful act of self-censorship.
</p>

<p>
To address these issues fully would require a nuanced psychological reading of Eliot's career based on information about his private life that is not currently available. But the beginning of a response may be deduced from three fugitive essays in which Eliot, more candidly than was his usual custom, reconsidered the significance of his own work. All three of these essays rehearse an inside history of modern literature, and all three were triggered by Eliot's uncomfortable intuition that he was, in ways that he had not yet acknowledged, connected to the other great English poet of his moment, William Butler Yeats and therefore also to the Wilde circle from which Yeats had emerged.
</p>

<p>
In 1922, soon after Yeats had published <i>The Trembling of the Veil</i>&#x02014;that section of his <i>Autobiographies</i> that concerns the 1890s&#x02014;Eliot published two short pieces that acknowledge the essential importance of Wilde and his circle to Eliot and to American modernism. Eliot's "Lettre D'Angleterre," first published in French in <i>La Nouvelle Revue Fran&#x000E7;aise</i> for March 1922 and then in English in the November 1923 <i>Vanity Fair</i> as "A Preface to Modern Literature," goes as far as to assert that "English Literature at the present time"&#x02014;a state of affairs that includes "a very small number of writers who will represent this time fifty years hence, but who are, at the moment, rather a part of the future"&#x02014;begins "about the date of the trial of Oscar Wilde" ("PML," 44).

Eliot comments, 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The effect of [the Wilde] trial upon English literary society was fatal. Here was a small group of English people, who had succeeded in the midst of Victorian society, in acquiring a high degree of emancipation from the worst English vices; which was neither insular, nor puritanical, nor cautious; a public scandal disposed of its social leader for ever; the broken group lost all influence upon English civilization. Wilde and his circle stood for something much more important than any of the individual members: they stood for the end of a type of culture. In general, they represented urbanity, Oxford education, the tradition of good writing, cosmopolitanism; they were in contact with the continent, and some of their most important members were Irish.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
First note here that, far from casting aspersions on the frivolity of the 1890s, Eliot associates it with some of his own highest values &#x02014; "urbanity," "culture," "civilization," "cosmopolitanism," and freedom from English "insularity" and "puritanism." Nor it seems is he damning with faint praise, holding back still grander accolades having to do with high moral seriousness, for he adds to his tribute the further comment that "the greatest merit of this group of people is, to my mind . . . a moral quality apparent in the group as a whole"&#x02014;a moral quality that Eliot defines in perhaps surprising terms ("PML," 44). The Wilde group, Eliot insists, ("serious writers" possessing "intellectual dignity") "had a curiosity, an audacity, a <i>recklessness</i> which are in violent contrast with that part of the present which I denominate as the already dead" ("PML," 44). 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's adversion to the "already dead" here is, I think, telling. Along with the phrases "intellectual dignity" and "cosmopolitanism," it attributes to Wilde and his group a critical temperament capable of dissociating the great cultural shibboleths of "Victorian society" associated with a false understanding of life in human nature and in art. Because of the loss of that critical temperament, Eliot goes on, the inevitable course of early twentieth-century cultural history, "after the collapse of the society in which Wilde was the most prominent member," was to produce a situation where "English literature is in a state of disintegration into at least three varieties of provincialism"&#x02014; English, Irish, and American &#x02014; with dire consequences for all three and for the whole of which they had once formed a part ("PML," 118). The Wilde trial, Eliot says, produced a "chasm," with the result that "the long tradition from Ben Jonson" was broken ("PML," 118). Consequently, Eliot argues, English provincial literature has collapsed into journalism, and Irish provincial literature, no longer having London as a safe "exile," has turned in on itself in the manner of Synge ("PML," 44). (Wilde's fall, Eliot says, may have in this way been momentous enough to have "led to the constitution of the Irish Free State" ("PML," 118) Meanwhile, Eliot and the live members of his generation who wish to continue the line for which "Walter Pater, in an earlier epoch, was an heir of Arnold and Ruskin, and Wilde the heir of Pater," find themselves "very much alone" ("PML" 118). 
</p>

<p>
Yet Eliot concludes that this situation, on its face utterly discouraging, has had its compensations. American literature, for example, in "the absence of any new creative effort in England," has been able to burst forth with provincial energy even though it retains a "commonplace" quality that derives from its lack of historical sense ("PML," 118). And, he implies, he, James Joyce, and Pound (the heirs because of their critical acumen and "audacity" of the lost generation of the 1890s and also the beneficiaries of the new opportunities opened to American writing by the sudden gap in live literature) have already managed to repair the break in a way that no critic in the interim generation of George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells could have foreseen.
</p>

<p>
Eliot extends his ruminations about the "chasm" caused by the fall of Wilde in an essay entitled "The Three Provincialities" which appeared in the Spring 1922 number of <i>Tyro.</i> "The Three Provincialities" most significantly develops Eliot's thoughts about the current place of American literature.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Still insisting on the provinciality of contemporary

<b></b>

American literature, and still holding a place for Joyce, Pound, and himself as the true heirs of Wilde's cosmopolitan exploitation of the English language, Eliot nevertheless stresses that "the advance of 'American literature' has been accelerated by the complete collapse of literary effort in England" and that, given the model of one of the "greatest and least local" American writers, "Edgar Poe," there exists at least the possibility that America may "in time develop a superior language" upon which might be elaborated "a separate American literature&#x02014;contingent, probably, upon the disappearance or sufficient degeneration of the English language in England."
</p>

<p>
Together, then, "A Preface to Modern Literature" and "The Three Provincialities" provide testimony to Eliot's sense of his own origins that is I think nowhere else available in Eliot's prose. Not only are they unequivocal about the importance of Wilde's cosmopolitan and anti-puritan "audacity" (and about the significance of his loss), they also clearly state the extent to which Eliot holds himself the descendant of Wilde's combination of seriousness and "<i>recklessness.</i>" As such, the articles serve to support the evidence supplied by Eliot's critical prose that he maintained both the substance and the subversive stance of Wilde's aesthetics, as for example in the slyly antiauthoritarian slant of his remarks on tradition. 
</p>

<p>
It is true that Eliot acknowledges in these essays in no uncertain terms the fact that the end of the Wilde group was caused by an act of social repression. Unlike Yeats, who in <i>The Trembling of the Veil</i> traces the demise of Wilde and his group primarily to the individuals themselves (sometimes suggesting moral flaws and elsewhere that they were tragically born at the wrong place in the wrong time), Eliot places the blame squarely on the "public scandal" of "the trial of Oscar Wilde." Nor are the implications of this conclusion unclear, though Eliot does not spell them out. If the task of his own generation is both to restore Wilde's cosmopolitan culture and to resist the obviously potent forces of English insularity, cautiousness, and puritanism, then the "very small number of writers" destined to accomplish this task must somehow both maintain Wilde's "recklessness" and consciously defend themselves against the powers that so recently created the "chasm" of modern literature. No less that Joyce's Stephen Daedalus in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, they must, Eliot implies, practice "silence, exile, and cunning."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot, that is to say, by 1922 had long since imagined his career as a conscious and calculated negotiation through a "vicious," "provincial" "insular," "puritanical," and "cautious" English milieu from which genuine "emancipation" was not a real possibility. To a considerable degree, there is justice in assuming that the distance Eliot put between the 1890s and his modernist colleagues was a "deliberate" strategy. Nevertheless and most curiously, however, Eliot in the same argument expresses a continuing need to practice Wilde's audacity rather than&#x02014;as both Shusterman and Ardis would have it&#x02014;refining it out of existence. Note also the odd exaggeration in Eliot's remark that Wilde had faltered while attempting to "emancipate" himself, and compare this to Josephine Guy's revisionary insistence that Wilde did not try to escape from Victorian conventions so much as he strove to subvert them quietly from within. Wilde fell, that 

<b></b>

is, not because he had defied Victorian Britain but because his protective coloration let him down. Eliot's retrospective account, though, needs to make Wilde's rebellion even more extreme than it was. Partly, this is to distinguish it from his own. Partly, however, Eliot's exaggeration of the heroic nature of Wilde's generation seems to express a genuine longing to have been part of an "emancipated" culture that never existed&#x02014;a longing that strangely matches the survivor's guilt voiced in both essays when Eliot speaks of the opportunities opened up to American literature.
</p>

<p>
Whatever calculation there was in Eliot's response to Wilde's tragedy then, also was complicated by psychic tension. It is therefore fascinating to see Eliot elaborate this strong but ambivalent identification with Wilde and his circle in another personal testimony later in his career. I refer to a passage which calls attention to itself precisely because of an urgency that vastly exceeds its argument. It is something that Eliot wrote fourteen years after "A Preface to Modern Literature," at a time when he was already forty-three years old and was convinced the best part of his career was behind him. The occasion for his remarks was Eliot's first visit to Dublin in January 1936, in the course of which he listened to an address by the Reverend Burke-Savage on "Literature at the Irish Crossroads" and then twice addressed the English Literary Society of University College, Dublin.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Eliot's second response, entitled "Tradition and the Practice of Poetry" and only published in the 1980s, shows Eliot again attempting to formulate his place in English letters and again lingering over his relation to Yeats. In it Eliot continues to propound a notion of genuinely "modern" art based on Hegel and Baudelaire in which the "revolutionary" or "reactionary" terms of the truly modern writer are dictated by the "need of [the artist's own] time and place" ("TPP," 11). In this view, Eliot explains, though the artist as poet is not always conscious of it, "the perpetual task of poetry is to <i>make all things new.</i> Not necessarily to make new things" ("TPP," 11), and the principal means of that renewal are to be found in a literature's "new contact with an older period of itself" ("remote enough to be of use") or "by contact with a foreign literature" ("TPP," 13). It is at this point that Eliot, invoking his "own experience," adverts to his contact with the 1890s. 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's history, more than usually suave, when read carefully turns out also to be exceedingly odd. For one thing, he begins, returning to the idiom of the remarks with which I began this essay, by telescoping poetic influence with the erotics of personal intimacy. Literary history, he says, is a matter of "fertilization" by the languages of different cultures, and: 
</p>

Eliot at the same time begins to describe his own encounter with the literature of another language (French Symbolist poetry) not in terms of his reading of that literature, but by a narrative of his relations with the English poets of the 1890s, who never really absorbed the French and yet somehow are allowed to remain the center of Eliot's attention:

Perhaps they were men who could not have developed further, but I am making that assumption. I certainly had much more in common with them than with the English poets who survived to my own day&#x02014;there were no American poets at all. Had they survived, they might have spoken in an idiom sufficiently like my own to have made anything I had to say superfluous.

What happened was that they made it possible for me to discover those poets. . . . When one reviews one's own writing, as when one reviews one's own life, how much there is that bears the appearance of mere chance! One has been dependent upon one's predecessors for what they did not do, as much as for what they did!

Especially interesting here is the personal horror that Eliot's summoning up of the 1890s arouses ("I cannot help wondering . . . whether [my own verse] <i>would have been written at all</i>"; "They might have spoken in an idiom sufficiently like my own <i>to have made anything I had to say superfluous</i>"). This is a reaction almost as pronounced as Virginia Woolf's when she reflected in 1928 that her father might have lived long enough to stifle her work: "Father's birthday. He would have been 96. 96, yes, today; &amp; could have been 96, like other people one has known; but mercifully was not. His life would have entirely ended mine. What would have happened? No writing, no books;&#x02014;inconceivable."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's remarks, though, shed light not on parental relations, but on amorous ones. And though he fixes in a similar way on the possibility of being closed down and closed off, his account enlarges Woolf's terror that "anything I had to say" might have been stifled before the fact by associating it with a very different kind of anxiety, a fear that he would have been denied a great intimacy&#x02014;the experience "of cross-fertilization"&#x02014; the way a lover is denied access to his beloved, by an older and potentially threatening suitor. (In this case the suitor is imagined as one who might have gone on "increasing in power.")

But why attribute this menacing power, even in the past, to the poets of the 1890s and to them alone? And why weight with such a heavy charge a deprivation that had never occurred? Eliot, after all, by 1936 had carried on twenty-five years of unimpeded interchange with French verse. Surely by then he felt no real fear of a broken connection? 
</p>

<p>
Contemplating this intense and complex anxiety (mocked, to be sure&#x02014;but also confirmed&#x02014;by the comedy in Eliot's comment about "mere chance"), one has to wonder about the lurking and unnamed relation that Eliot implies had NOT been allowed&#x02014;a relation that seems to have been closed down by Eliot himself. If Eliot, that is, focuses on the 1890s when the occasion required a serious glance not at England 

<b></b>

but at France, he does so because his real deprivation seems to have been not from France (access to which he was never deprived) but from "the generation of the [English] 'nineties,'" whose presence Eliot calls up as if in a s&#x000E9;ance and then fails to substantively address.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's strongly felt but unspoken anxiety here, inherent in his strange mention of the potentially increasing power of the 1890s and in the strong inhibition that keeps him from addressing the poets of the 1890s in a concrete way, testifies to the deep and uncomfortable roots of his relations with Wilde and his circle. Such roots sink deep enough to color Eliot's argument, I would suggest, more definitively than any conscious career strategy. Though Eliot's efforts to distance himself from the 1890s are undeniable, they seem less to have stemmed from a steady resolution than to have enacted a vacillating ambivalence, for which the language of deliberation does not fully account. Part of that ambivalence undoubtedly involved a sexual component&#x02014;else why Eliot's recourse to the erotics of influence?&#x02014;but there is no need to assume that the impulse amounts to a cover-up of real-life sexual experience. If we read Eliot's desire for and guilt about his identification with the English Decadents as overdetermined and unconscious, the continuing force of that identification becomes much more interesting.

I should say that the mind of any poet would be magnetized in its own way, to select automatically, in his reading (from picture papers and cheap novels, indeed, as well as serious books . . .), the material&#x02014;an image, a phrase, a word&#x02014;which may be of use to him later. There might be the experience of a child of ten, a small boy peering through sea-water in a rock-pool, and finding a sea-anemone for the first time: the simple experience (not so simple, for an exceptional child, as it looks) might lie dormant in his mind for twenty years, and re-appear transformed in some verse-context charged with great imaginative pressure.

The "Shadow" that falls in <i>The Hollow Men</i> "Between the emotion / And the response / . . . Between the desire / And the spasm" thwarts sexual consummation in a land where "Lips that would kiss / Form prayers to broken stone."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Neither emotion nor desire is absent; indeed, the hollow men "trembl[e] with tenderness" at night. But the Shadow interposes, and desire is spent in obscure and ineffectual religious rites (<i>CPP,</i> 57-8).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Eliot's poetry is full of such frustrating shadows, though not all are quite so portentous. The waiter in "Dans le Restaurant" recounts his sexual awakening with a young girl with whom he once took shelter from the monsoon rains under "Les saules tremp&#x000E9;s, et des bourgeons sur les ronces" ("The sodden willows, and buds on the brambles").<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  He gave her flowers and tickled her, but the rendezvous was spoiled by the arrival of "un gros chien" ("a large dog"), which frightened the boy. The girl, aged by a few years, makes a similar appearance in "La ia che Piange," "[h]er hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers" (<i>CPP,</i> 20). She resurfaces in <i>The Waste Land,</i> wet and vital as before, and wooed again with a gift of flowers. The assignation, now relocated to the hyacinth garden, is derailed this time by the boy's metaphysical impotence:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
&#x02014;Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, 
<br />
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not

<br />
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
<br />
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.

It is the spiritual vacuity of the waste land that casts its nebulous shadow here between the emotion and the response. The trysting tree, so lush in the tropical setting of "Dans le Restaurant," stands "dead" nearby and "gives no shelter" in <i>The Waste Land</i> (<i>CPP,</i> 38). And the interfering dog is still hard on the boy's heels, threatening now to dig up a corpse recently planted in the garden. I will return later to the significance of this moment. Meanwhile note the similar congeries of images in a quite different poem, <i>Ash-Wednesday,</i> where the speaker, reduced by leopards to a pile of bones, serenades his Lady under a juniper-tree, offering (ironic?) praise for the death of love in "the Garden / Where all loves end" (<i>CPP,</i> 61-2). Still later, in <i>The Family Reunion,</i> Harry Monchensey and his putative love interest, Mary, recall their childhood meetings in a "hollow tree in a wood by the river," now the locale of Harry's "only memory of freedom" (<i>CPP,</i> 248). A false hyacinth girl, Mary enters this scene of recollection bearing an armload of greenhouse flowers (<i>CPP,</i> 244). Between her and the brooding Harry fall the shadows of the Furies, of his deceased, yet relentlessly present wife, and of Time.

<p>
So many trysts under so many trees and in so many gardens; so many shadows to blight the outcome! The pattern saturates Eliot's oeuvre. Yet the matrix in which Eliot's hapless assignations gestated lay to a large degree outside the corpus of high culture in which scholars have generally sought out his sources. Eliot's assignations are in fact comprehensive distortions of the innocent trysts in the sheltering shadows that were common in turn-of-the-century popular song. His imagination appears to have been "magnetized," according to his own metaphor, by a specific genre of song marked by recurring images and objects that reappear, transred, in his poetry, "charged with great imaginative pressure" (<i>UP,</i> 69-70). A series of historical accidents&#x02014;the rediscovery of the suppressed opening page of the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscript; some chance references that have been preserved&#x02014;yields a unique opportunity to view the ways in 

<b></b>

which Eliot's creative mind was stocked not only by his wide reading, and not only by high culture, but by the illicit world of popular culture, including such transient forms as sentimental Victorian parlor songs and the workaday productions of Tin Pan Alley hacks&#x02014;precisely the kinds of cultural influences of which Eliot's work was believed for decades to have been edifyingly free. I will argue furthermore, with all due deference to the complexity of the relation between Eliot's work and his life, that such influences were constituent elements not only of Eliot's poems but of his <i>self</i>. By shaping and delimiting Eliot's conceptions of love and sexual attachment, popular song scripted important relationships in his life and exerted a decisive influence on his art.

Eliot penciled in this curious couplet on the first page of the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscript; later he struck it out. Ultimately the entire page&#x02014;which contained a Joycean episode set in Boston and incorporating a number of popular song allusions&#x02014;suffered the same fate.
</p>

<p>
As Valerie Eliot, who edited the 1971 publication of the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscript, was the first to observe, Eliot has here spliced together lines from two different songs. T. S. Allen's "By the Watermelon Vine" was a 1904 "coon song," its imagery that of the "old plantation" replete with watermelon patches and sugar cane, its language vintage minstrel dialect:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
When the moon am shining, and the darkies am a-singing,
<br />
Oh, oh, Miss Lindy,
<br />
Over to the big house where the banjos am a-ringing,
<br />
Oh, oh, my Lindy Lou.
<br />
In the melon patch we sit as cute as can be,
<br />
Just you and me, on the trunk of a tree,
<br />
And just like the nightingale I'm happy and free,
<br />
Singing the same old song:

<p class="blockquote">

<i>Chorus</i>
<br />
Lindy, Lindy, sweet as the sugar cane,
<br />
Lindy, Lindy, say you'll be mine.
<br />
When the moon am a-shining,
<br />
Then my heart am a-pining,
<br />
Meet me pretty Lindy by the watermelon vine.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Although the lyric locates the couple's courtship on a tree trunk in the watermelon patch, the song's cover illustration condenses this image by depicting Miss Lindy sitting demurely beside her admirer&#x02014;an incongruously boyish "darky"&#x02014;on a tremendous

<b></b>

slice of watermelon (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). The trees are relegated to the background, behind the cotton. The moon rises brightly behind them; the eponymous vine itself is nowhere in sight.
</p>

<p>
If preserved, an early reference in <i>The Waste Land</i> to "By the Watermelon Vine" would have situated Eliot's poem in a racialized, popular, American context that scarcely survives in the poem's published version outside the "Shakespeherian Rag."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The song that Eliot folded into his quotation from "By the Watermelon Vine" would also have contributed, though less explicitly, to that contextualization. Mae Sloane's "My Evaline" premiered in a 1901 vaudeville-minstrel act.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Widespread in the repertoire of barbershop quartets, this song was especially popular among Ivy League crooners during Eliot's years at Harvard:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
My Evaline,
<br />
Say you'll be mine.
<br />
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear?
<br />
'Way down yonder in the old cornfield,<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
<br />
For you I pine.
<br />
Sweeter than the honey to the honey bee,
<br />
I love you, say you love me.
<br />
Meet me in the shade of the old apple tree,
<br />
Eevah, Ivah, Ohvah, Evaline!<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
On the deleted opening page of <i>The Waste Land,</i> Eliot fuses "My Evaline" with "By the Watermelon Vine" at the point where the lyrics intersect&#x02014;where "Meet me Pretty Lindy by the watermelon vine" crosses "Meet me in the shade of the old apple tree." The link, obviously, is an invitation to a lovers' tryst in the embrace of a sheltering Nature, represented here, as in "Dans le Restaurant," by a combination of trees and vines. And in this synthesis we catch first sight of the "assignation topos"&#x02014;the particular combination of a basic trysting scenario with such concomitant images as trees (or a garden), shadows, and the moon&#x02014;that runs directly from turn-of-the-century popular music into Eliot's poetry, where it always carries a tincture of failure and regret.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The shadows in Eliot's poetry, that is, evoke and disre a recognizable motif drawn most immediately from popular culture.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As both "My Evaline" and "By the Watermelon Vine" illustrate, the healthy sexual liaison in American song is often projected onto stereotypically carefree and unrepressed African American couples. It is in keeping with this common trope that the illustrator of "By the Watermelon Vine" chooses to give his male re the childlike features of the pickaninny type despite the resultant incongruity: the re so drawn is cute and sexually unthreatening, whereas the adult black male who would more obviously correspond with the artist's rendering of a mature Miss Lindy would trouble the simpleminded primitivism of the song. Eliot would later parody this popular-primitivist mode of thought&#x02014;and indeed the entire assignation topos&#x02014;in <i>Sweeney Agonistes,</i> with its send-up of the Bob Cole/Johnson Brothers' 1902 hit, "Under the Bamboo Tree."

In the shadow of this tree, the pleasures of casual sex and cannibalism meet, and primitive health turns out to be no different from civilized disease.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In the Ur-<i>Waste Land,</i> similarly, the pure-hearted trysts recalled in Eliot's song allusions run up against the various sexual failures and mechanical or violent consummations that occupy the body of the poem, which collectively throw a caustic light on the innocent pretensions of the Tin Pan Alley lyricists. What <i>really</i> goes on in the shadows is amply illustrated in Eliot's poem, where the Thames-daughters are deflowered among the city's "'Trams and dusty trees'" (<i>CPP,</i> 46); where the nymphs and their "friends" have spent amorous summer nights under the "river's tent," formed by the leafy branches along the riverbank (<i>CPP,</i> 42); and where Philomel, we are reminded, was raped and mutilated by Tereus in a "sylvan scene" (<i>CPP,</i> 40).
</p>

<p>
It hardly matters, then, that Eliot ultimately struck out his allusion to "My Evaline" and "By the Watermelon Vine," or even that he and Pound deleted the entire opening scene in which the reference had appeared. We know that these songs were present to Eliot's mind as he composed <i>The Waste Land,</i> and that he associated them strongly enough with his project to consider direct quotations from them. An attraction to and disillusionment with the assignation topos formed a part of the impulse behind the poem&#x02014;an impulse connected with the inadequacies of sexual passion, the failure of human compassion, and the desecration of nature. <i>The Waste Land,</i> so perceived, is an elaborate mockery of the ideals embodied in Evaline and Miss Lindy and given enthusiastic voice by their beaus of popular song.

It was in April 1911, while he was studying in Paris, that Eliot made his first visit to London, the city that in a few years was to become his home for the rest of his life. Of Eliot's first experience of London, little record has been preserved beyond one stray fact: that his memories of it were haunted, as he remarked a half-century later, by a particular tune: "In the Shadows," by Herman Finck.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  At the time of Eliot's visit, Finck (1872-1939) was the conductor at the Palace Theatre, one of the large, posh music halls of Leicester Square. "In the Shadows" was an orchestral composition that accompanied a genteel dance routine performed by the celebrated Palace Girls. When the music proved popular with audiences, Finck's publisher hired E. Ray Goetz&#x02014;best remembered for the words of "For Me and My Gal" and the Hawaiian love song "Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula"&#x02014;to add lyrics. Cued by Finck's title, Goetz naturally adopted the assignation topos and its familiar posture of invitation:
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
Eliot may conceivably have come across "In the Shadows" in his very first visit to an English music hall; the Palace was certainly a big enough draw to attract a young tourist who was already a fan of American vaudeville. He would in any case have heard the widely played song, both with and without Goetz's lyrics, around town in 1911 and throughout the succeeding decade, the gestation period of <i>The Waste Land.</i>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the assignation topos that both songs invoke, "In the Shadows" and "By the Watermelon Vine" come from different worlds, culturally as well as geographically. Though chronologically the later song, "In the Shadows" belongs generically to an earlier era, while the racialized and syncopated "Watermelon Vine" gestures forward toward the Jazz Age.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The cover art from "In the Shadows" shares the other's trees and moon, but its gowned, long-haired ladies dancing <i>en point</i> leave no doubt about its difference (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The popularity of "In the Shadows" in fact dates to the last moment before Irving Berlin's "Alexander's Ragtime Band" follows Eliot across the Atlantic in 1911 to bring ragtime to Europe, after which English music would never be the same, either in or out of the music halls. Both tunes were in the repertoire of the chamber orchestra aboard the Titanic.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  But by 1912 the new American popular music represented by Berlin was already beginning to displace the light-classical elegance of Finck and his peers. There is thus a sort of cultural poignancy to Finck's "In the Shadows"&#x02014;to this piece that, in retrospect, marks the end of an era in European history and culture, when the so-called Americanization of the continent is just poised to begin.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Goetz's lyrics, it is true, exhibit the sort of Victorian sentimentalism and late-romantic clich&#x000E9; that modernists were eager to annihilate; his words are a virtual compilation of assignation-topos clich&#x000E9;s, including twilight and dusk, moonbeams, gently sighing evening breezes, rustling leaves, drowsy "birds of love," an attendant Cupid, and "peeping" stars.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Finck's music, on the other hand, deftly alternates graceful buoyancy with romantic wistfulness, making it a perfect expression of its transitional cultural moment.
</p>

<p>
Why "In the Shadows" rather than another song&#x02014;or a sensory experience of another kind altogether&#x02014;should have come to represent for Eliot this period in his life is inevitably a matter for speculation. Some unrecoverable combination of historical and personal nostalgia may have been involved; the song's investment in the tryst-in-the-shadows motif that haunts Eliot's poetry certainly was. For Eliot's attraction to assignation lyrics substantially predated his introduction to London. He was drawn to them, by the same token, long before he could have associated them with Vivien Eliot, Emily Hale, Jean Verdenal, or anyone in particular.
</p>

<p>
In a December 1957 radio broadcast, Eliot recounted to his BBC audience a childhood discovery made in a dentist's office where he had recurring appointments for orthodontia. Among the reading matter available in the waiting room, the young Eliot found himself attracted to a couplet from Bishop Henry King's poem "The Exequy"&#x02014;a couplet that stood as epigraph to a short story: <b></b>

Even as a boy, Eliot was so moved by these lines that, by his own account, he "could not rest until he had read the poem entire."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  He would then have discovered that King's proposed tryst is both tender and macabre, as the bereft speaker promises to

join his wife presently in the tomb. King's "hollow Vale" finds its most obvious echo in the "hollow valley" of <i>The Hollow Men,</i> which, too, is the "last of meeting places." No lost lovers are rejoined here, however; the inhabitants merely "grope together / And avoid speech," sublimating their sexual impulses (<i>CPP,</i> 58).
</p>

<p>
In "The Metaphysical Poets," Eliot calls King's "Exequy" "one of the finest poems of the age" and quotes sixteen lines, beginning with the same "hollow Vale" couplet. He also mentions the poem's "effect of terror which is several times attained by one of Bishop King's admirers, Edgar Poe."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Indeed it was in one of Poe's tales that Eliot discovered King's poem&#x02014;a story whose title, incidentally, is "The Assignation." In his own riff on "The Exequy," Poe leads the reader to anticipate a reunion of two ideal romantic lovers. The narrator learns in the last moment, however, and the reader with him, that the tryst they have arranged is actually a suicide pact: the lovers die by poison, one hour after sunrise, in their separate Venetian palazzi, the Byronic male with King's couplet on his lips. Like his Decadent predecessors, Eliot recognized the chilling drama generated by the corruption of an innocent plot line, and his abuse of the assignation topos in his poems mimics, in its own way, Poe's treatment of the same theme.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot attempted an "Exequy" of his own&#x02014;a poem that, on Ezra Pound's urging, was discarded from <i>The Waste Land.</i> In Eliot's "Exequy," the speaker self-mockingly imagines his "suburban tomb" becoming a haven for lovers' trysts, and thus parodies himself in death as "A local deity of love," his tomb the center of his own "sacred grove." The lovers, red as his "adepts," "twine beneath the trees / In sacramental exercise" (i.e., sexual activity); his marble statue is decorated with "flowers of deflowered maids" (<i>WLF,</i> 101). An alternative third stanza locates the "amorous adepts" both "underneath the trees" and "in the clinging vine."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  If such adepts are reminiscent of other outdoor fornicators in <i>The Waste Land,</i> the scene also reflects leeringly the reference in Eliot's abandoned opening episode to an ingenuous assignation "in the shadow of the / watermelon Vine."
</p>

<p>
The frequent references to shades and shadows throughout the assignation-song genre suggest a quite different provenance than is usually acknowledged for <i>The Waste Land</i>'s "Come in under the shadow of this red rock" (<i>CPP,</i> 38). Surrounded by the language of biblical prophecy, this invitation appears unconnected with matters of romance. The promised revelation of "fear in a handful of dust," however, materializes as the immediately ensuing tableau in the hyacinth garden: it is here in a fruitless assignation that we are shown human terror in action.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's famous line has a precursor in another of <i>The Waste Land'</i>s pendant poems, "The Death of Saint Narcissus," which begins, "Come under the shadow of this gray rock" (<i>WLF,</i> 95). Here the shadow is more overtly sensual, as the speaker offers to show us "the gray shadow" on Narcissus's dead lips and proceeds to tell us of his adventures, real or imagined, which hint of masochism, rape, and masturbation. The gray shadow, ironically, becomes the sign that Narcissus's desires have been purged in a sexualized spirituality&#x02014;an exact inversion of the obstructing shadow in Eliot's other poems, especially <i>The Hollow Men.</i> What gratifies Narcissus is his experience of merging with another after a lifetime of absorption in his own limbs and flesh. The other comes, however, in the form of arrows that penetrate him:

<i>The Waste Land,</i> where April comes cruelly "breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land," withholds even the satisfaction of oblivion (<i>CPP,</i> 37). And Eliot rewrites his hero's surrender in his "Exequy," where an avatar of Narcissus, "his shadowed beauty stained," appears in the final stanza. Now a failed lover&#x02014;whether "disdainful or disdained" appears not to matter&#x02014;he comes to immolate himself at the speaker's sacred tomb, but hears as he does so a "breathless chuckle underground" (<i>WLF,</i> 101).<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  This is the voice of the buried speaker, who bitterly repeats Arnaud Daniel's "sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor" ("Be mindful in due time of my pain") from the <i>Purgatorio,</i> suggesting that he, too, was a victim of failed sexual love. Arnaud's own sin, after all, was lust, for which he burns; the self-immolating Narcissus of Eliot's "Exequy" has come to join his ghastly company. Arnaud's lust, coupled with his directive to remember, invokes another characteristic motif of the referential web that Eliot spun out of his popular-song quotations.

<p class="noIndent">
The most famous exemplar of the assignation topos in American popular song dates from 1905 and represents one of the biggest successes Tin Pan Alley ever produced. Eliot, with his eye for allusion, can hardly have missed the quotation of its title at the musical climax of "My Evaline."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Written by the team of composer Egbert Van Alstyne and lyricist Harry Williams, "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree" describes two meetings in the shadows. A young couple in springtime enjoy their first shy embrace, and the girl, a local, offers her beau, who is visiting from the city, the promise of a second assignation:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
With a heart that is true
<br />
I'll be waiting for you,
<br />
In the shade of the old apple tree.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  <b></b>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
That promise appears broken when the boy returns, bearing flowers, for her funeral. The discovery that her last wish was to be buried beneath the apple tree, however, reveals touchingly that she has indeed kept her word.
</p>

<p>
When Eliot altered "My Evaline's" "Meet me in the shade of the old apple tree, / Eva-Iva-Ova-Evaline" to "Meet me in the shadow of the watermelon Vine / Eva Iva Uva Emmaline" in the <i>Waste Land</i> drafts, he effectively swapped out the apple tree for the watermelon vine (<i>WLF,</i> 5). This may be either a conscious avoidance or an unconscious suppression of the sentimentality of the famous song; it also, as we have already noted, effectively "races" and in that sense modernizes the proposition. Whether or not Eliot's occlusion of the apple tree was deliberate, the song summed up and brought to a peak of popularity a pattern of feeling and imagery that apparently entered his mind at a formative stage and that he continued to work over in his poetry for many years. Upon examination, "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree" intersects in more than one way with <i>The Waste Land.</i> The couple's momentary embrace in the first verse, which transforms their lives, preres the "awful daring of a moment's surrender" in the poem's closing movement. "By this, and this only, we have existed / which is not to be found in our obituaries," Eliot memorably affirms (<i>CPP,</i> 49), asserting what is implicit in the song lyric through the young woman's choice of her burial place. "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree" is notably <i>not</i> an expression of simple romantic joy or pleasure in the vein of "By the Watermelon Vine." It is, rather, a song of "memory and desire," just as <i>The Waste Land</i> is a poem of "memory and desire."
</p>

<p>
That description applies as well to "The Maid of the Mill," another popular song that Eliot references on the canceled opening page of <i>The Waste Land.</i> Its speaker thinks back through the years to his encounters "in a mill beside the sea" with "a little maiden, who plighted her faith" to him. Both the trysting-place and the girl herself are long since extinct, and the disappearance of "such maidens [and] such mill wheels" seems to the speaker, in his old age, to mark the decadence of his culture. The good past lives on for him, however, in his memory of her words, themselves an injunction to remember:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
"Do not forget me! Do not forget me!
<br />

<br />
When the morn breaks and the throstle awakes.

[<i>con passione</i>] Do not forget me! Do not forget me!
<br />
Remember the maid, the maid of the mill!"<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"The Maid of the Mill," from an 1887 operetta of the same name, is the oldest song Eliot quotes in the <i>Waste Land</i> drafts, where it is sung in a pub called the "Opera Exchange" by a Mr. Fay. By 1921-1922 this song seemed far more dated than the others Eliot quoted or considered quoting; no doubt it is invoked in the poem precisely because it marks the culture of an earlier generation. Perhaps the same is true of Mr. Fay himself; his name recalls fairies and elves, and the adjective <i>fey</i> suggests otherworldliness.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
What may be most striking about "The Maid of the Mill" in relation to <i>The Waste Land</i> is its memorializing imperative, which points to a lost Shakespearean leitmotif that, but for the editing process, might have run the length of the poem alongside "Those are pearls that were his eyes." "Remember me," the last command of the ghost of Hamlet's father, was to have carried over from "The Maid of the Mill" to the drowned sailor in "Death by Water":

&#x02014;or, as Eliot originally had it, "I remember / The hyacinth garden" (<i>WLF,</i> 19). The hyacinth girl, like her forerunner, the maid of the mill, remains the insistent object of memory and desire.

<p>
The dead wife or beloved who will not be forgotten is one of Eliot's obsessions throughout his oeuvre, and a number of critics have seen <i>The Waste Land,</i> too, as an elegy&#x02014;a work of mourning for a soldier lost in the Great War, frequently identified with Eliot's friend Jean Verdenal.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Such readings tend to foreground Phlebas, the drowned Phoenician sailor, as a re for the dead comrade.

In response to his wife's interrogation of what he knows, sees, and remembers, the male speaker mutely offers the transformation of the drowned sailor&#x02014;thus fulfilling the sailor's plea to be remembered&#x02014;and the failed tryst in the hyacinth garden, as though the two incidents were one. An indissoluble link is thus forged.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Though the elegiac tradition from the Greek classics to "Lycidas" and beyond surely might have offered Eliot sufficient models, <i>The Waste Land</i> as a man's work of mourning for a man constructs its own symbolic repertoire from a miscellany of sources that include Shakespeare, the myths of Hyacinth and Narcissus, and the <i>fin de si&#x000E8;cle</i> cult of St.

Sebastian, upon all of which the assignation topos is brought to bear. The popular topos as a result is thus distorted, &#x000E0; la Poe, in a way that transforms the stock responses it normally evoked&#x02014;feelings of romantic warmth or wistful nostalgia&#x02014;into horror, dread, and a crushing sense of remorse.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the last twist of Eliot's knife in his refashioning of the assignation topos is his protagonist's guilt over and possible complicity in the death of the beloved, the final perversion of "Love will find its own / When we are alone / In the shadows" into gothic horror. This theme survives from the early "Love Song of St. Sebastian" into <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i> and, ultimately, <i>The Family Reunion.</i> It is the focus, too, of the "Elegy" excised from <i>The Waste Land,</i> in which the obsessively penitent speaker is haunted by visions of a "dear" yet "inconvenient" female corpse returned from the dead, "as in a tale by Poe" (<i>WLF,</i> 117). With this motif of guilt and dreams of murder in mind, Hugh Kenner has argued that the corpse that Stetson has lately planted in his garden, and which "the dog" threatens to "dig up again," is the drowned body of the hyacinth girl.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  We do, after all, pass quickly enough in "The Burial of the Dead" from the hyacinth garden to Stetson's garden that it seems not illogical to associate the two. Only Madame Sosostris, with her warning to "Fear death by water," comes between. And the wetness of the hyacinth girl's hair, apparently a token of vitality, takes on a new cast when the allusion to another young woman betrayed, the mad Ophelia, soon to drown, follows in the next section of the poem. Further hints along these lines are bared in the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscript, such as the sentence that once preceded the lines I have now quoted twice from "A Game of Chess":
</p>

With this matrimonial conversation in mind, Kenner does not hesitate to identify the drowned hyacinth girl with Vivien Eliot. If he is right that a murder fantasy underlies "The Burial of the Dead," then Eliot's reference therein to "The Maid of the Mill," with its repeated injunction not to forget a dead lover, takes on a new intensity, the song's unqualified innocence deformed more than ever into ghoulishness. Eliot may also have had in mind any number of other songs in the same genre that more nearly approach his own imagery, such as Meta Orred's remarkable lyric beginning

I do not suggest that Eliot ever consciously alluded to this particular song of 1878, though it was popular throughout his childhood and is not unlikely to have been sung around his parents' parlor piano. My point is rather that a usable reservoir of phrases, symbols, and situations&#x02014;components of the objective correlatives that constitute, according to Eliot, "[t]he only way of expressing emotion in the form of art"&#x02014;existed all around him in the popular culture and provisioned his imagination.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  For as Eliot himself insisted in 1933, "of course only a part of an author's imagery comes from his reading. It comes from the whole of his sensitive life since early childhood" (<i>UP,</i> 141). Popular music was a part of that whole, in Eliot's case, and its marks on his imagination remain visible even when, as in <i>The Waste Land,</i> most of its visible traces have been erased from the surface of his poetry.

To halt here at the frontiers of psychology and join Eliot in his conclusions about the sources of poetry, however, would be to fail our evidence, which suggests something deeper and more disquieting. Emotions, as Foucault demonstrated in his <i>History of Sexuality,</i> are themselves products of culture&#x02014;not "timeless givens which sprout from the soil of an eternal 'inner' self, but . . . culturally structured experiences, interpretations, and performances of the self."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In light of this insight, the persistent return of the assignation topos in Eliot's work as well as the fact that his fascination with it appears to precede even his earliest poems suggests that not just Eliot's poetry but the feelings and incidents that went <i>into</i> the poetry were themselves given form by the popular topos. Through the representations of romantic love in popular assignation songs, in conjunction with his readings, the young Eliot reached&#x02014;or fashioned&#x02014;an erotic self-understanding that awaited an object. Jean Verdenal, perhaps in his life and assuredly through his untimely death, stepped into a nostalgic role that was created for him by the yearning strains of "In the Shadows" and "The Maid of the Mill," as well as by King's "Exequy" and other literary texts.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Vivien Eliot, the transred bride, now a Fury, similarly assumed a character made available to her through an assortment of classical sources and grotesquely warped popular images. Like Verdenal, Vivien was latent in Eliot's imagination before she materialized in the flesh. Such were the operations of Eliot's constitutional theatricality. Yet this is by no means to imply that Eliot falsified his feelings, for it is a <i>function</i> of culture&#x02014;to which Eliot, like anyone else, was subject&#x02014;"not simply to discover emotional truths but to create them."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What is more, Eliot himself was uncomfortably <i>aware</i> of the power of culture to structure our emotions: this is a theme he takes up with a certain regularity in his poetry. At times he reacts defensively, representing culture's sway over the susceptible masses while condescendingly implying his own immunity. In "The Death of the Duchess," one of <i>The Waste Land's</i> pendant poems, it is the "inhabitants of Hampstead" who "know what they are to feel and what to think" because the daily paper dictates to them (<i>WLF,</i> 105)&#x02014;a condition they share with the "readers of the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>" in an earlier poem (<i>CPP,</i> 16), and with the Londoners in the unedited "Fire Sermon," whose ant-like "motions" are recorded by the "aberrant" and superior 

<b></b>

mind of the poet (<i>WLF,</i> 31).<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  More bracing are the moments when Eliot's speakers are forced to confront their own implication in the common run of desires and experiences, a confrontation that leaves them deeply troubled. In "Dans le Restaurant," the speaker is shocked to find his own secret memories and feelings voiced by an ordinary waiter. "De quel droit payes-tu des exp&#x000E9;riences comme moi?" he growls indignantly&#x02014;"What right do you have to suffer for experiences like me?" (<i>CPP,</i> 32).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The speaker perceives with considerable resentment that the waiter's failed assignation, like his own, is the menial's Promethean "vautour" (vulture), the memory that gnaws at him every day. The speaker shares with the waiter, and with a suddenly unknown number of others, the putatively private memories and desires he had up till now treasured as uniquely his own. Had he recognized the source of his own feelings in the many popular songs featuring the assignation topos, he might have spared himself the shock.
</p>

<p>
In "Portrait of a Lady," similarly, the aloof persona finds himself inexplicably touched by a popular song heard in a public park, an experience that threatens his apparently secure distinction from ordinary people and their emotions. When the "worn-out common song" assails his self-possession, he tries to fend off his discomfiture by suggesting that the song "recall[s] things that other people have desired," disavowing any such desires on his own part (<i>CPP,</i> 10). The very threat to his self-possession, however, shows that he dissembles, and the speaker himself immediately questions his attempt at displacement: "Are these ideas right or wrong?" He cannot avert from himself the harsh scrutiny to which he subjects the lady, whose almost every sentiment he recognizes as a commonplace post-Romantic construct. Out of what cultural phrasebook come the speaker's own poses, and even his irony? He is not sure that he knows. The desires instigated by the popular song, in the meanwhile, mix&#x02014;in a line that strongly evokes the yet-to-be-written hyacinth garden episode from <i>The Waste Land</i>&#x02014;"With the smell of hyacinths across the garden" (<i>CPP,</i> 10). Elsewhere in "Portrait," desire is entangled with lilacs, which the eponymous lady "twists . . . in her fingers" while alluding to her "buried life, and Paris in the Spring" (<i>CPP,</i> 9). The opening passage of <i>The Waste Land</i> of course associates lilacs with the mixing of memory and desire, and Eliot himself, referring in 1934 to his own days of "Paris in the Spring" with Jean Verdenal, reverts to the terms of that passage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am willing to admit that my own retrospect is touched by a sentimental sunset, the <i>memory</i> of a friend coming across the Luxembourg Gardens in the late afternoon, waving a branch of <i>lilac</i>, a friend who was later (so far as I could find out) to be <i>mixed</i> with the mud of Gallipoli.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Tellingly, although critics have associated both the hyacinths and the lilacs in <i>The Waste Land</i> with Jean Verdenal, the references to the same flowers in "Portrait of a Lady" come from Part II, which was completed in February 1910, eight months before Eliot first met Verdenal.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The images in "Portrait" that seem so obviously to allude to some "buried life" of Eliot's own (and in Paris, no less!) cannot do so, suggesting again that Eliot's life took shape from his words and not the other way. Before the words came 

<b></b>

the imagination, and before the imagination, the culture that structured it. When Eliot grants that his own memories are diffracted through the "sentimental," he returns us to such sources as "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree," which by 1910 could fairly be called a "worn-out common song," and in which the speaker revisits the shadows under the trysting tree bearing a "bunch of flow'rs . . . / To place upon a freshly moulded grave." Whether lilacs or hyacinths he does not say.
</p>

<p>
The assignation topos never relinquished its hold on Eliot. The consequence of the spoiled tryst haunts his poetry after <i>The Hollow Men,</i> taking the lacerating form of the voices of the children who, because of the missed moment, were never brought into life. In Eliot's rewriting of the hyacinth garden, the lovers manqu&#x000E9;s of "Burnt Norton" return in imagination "Down the passage which we did not take / Towards the door we never opened / Into the rose-garden," where, in a mystical vision, the dry pool appears suddenly "filled with water out of sunlight," its "surface glitter[ing]," in a phrase reiterated from the earlier scene, "out of the heart of light" (<i>CPP,</i> 117-8). The dissipation of this sublime vision releases a volley of sound, "for the leaves were full of children, / Hidden excitedly, containing laughter." If this scene represents the aftermath of the failed assignation in the hyacinth garden, it also recapitulates the tryst in "Dans le Restaurant," where the brief sensual contact between the childish pair peaks in a bout of tickling (<i>CPP,</i> 31). This motif of concealed children in the leaves is sounded over and over&#x02014;in "New Hampshire," in "Marina," in "East Coker," in "Little Gidding"&#x02014;always with the same suggestions of "elation" darkened by regret.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The rose garden scene in "Burnt Norton," like other Eliotic assignation scenes, has often been associated with Emily Hale, the young woman Eliot left behind when he made his fateful decision to emigrate, and the mature woman with whom he carried on a long, unconsummated relationship, and to whom he wrote 1,000 letters between 1930 and the late 1950s. While it is true that, as Lyndall Gordon argues, Eliot assimilated her to Dante's Beatrice, an essentially unattainable object of remembered passion, reverence, and rue,<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  the particular images and scenes through which Eliot's poetry represents this relationship are by no means all derived from the <i>Vita Nuova.</i> Eliot's fracturing of the assignation topos from popular song brought together Beatrice, the maid of the mill, and Lindy Lou in one perpetually deferred, infinitely regretted woman's body. More clearly even than Jean Verdenal or Vivien Eliot, Emily Hale&#x02014;not only in Eliot's work, but also, ultimately, in her own life, which conformed gradually to Eliot's design&#x02014;was generated by the operation of culture, both high and low, on a magnetized imagination.

This line appears to be a deliberate allusion to another well-known barbershop song, "Way Down Yonder in the Cornfield," whose lyrics poke fun at stereotypical black thievery; see <i>Barber Shop Ballads and How to Sing Them</i>, ed. Sigmund Spaeth (New York: Prentice, 1940), 41-3. This reference underscores the racial cast of "My Evaline," which is perhaps not altogether apparent to twenty-first-century readers. The line that follows, "For you I pine," is lifted from the most famous barbershop quartet of all, "My Adeline" , making "My Evaline" practically Eliotic in the intrepidity of its plagiarism.

Although Eliot seems to have been influenced most by songs in this genre ca. 1900-1911, it should be said that the assignation topos had by then an impressive century-old lineage. The Library of Congress' <i>Music for the Nation</i> (<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/mussmhtml/mussmhome.html">http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/mussmhtml/mussmhome.html</a>) lists 59 songs dating from 1820-1885 whose titles begin with the phrase "Meet me." While not all of these qualify as assignation songs by my definition, a far larger number of legitimate assignation songs bear other titles. The same site, for example, lists 100 songs whose titles contain the words "shade" or "shadow," many of which draw on the assignation topos.

Ronald Schuchard traces Eliot's shadow motif to the fin de si&#x000E8;cle "sensual-spiritual malaise" that, according to Lionel Johnson's "The Dark Angel," will never "allow / Delight untortured by desire." This shadow, which Eliot discovered in his early attention to the English Symbolists, soon became a "constant player in his poems and plays" up through <i>Four Quartets</i>. See Schuchard's <i>Eliot's Dark Angel: Intersections of Life and Art</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 14-5. I see no conflict between Schuchard's genealogy and the one I am suggesting here: Eliot's was always a poetics of overdetermination.

The instrumental sheet music cover boasts of a May 1910 command performance of "In the Shadows" for King George V and his guest, Kaiser Wilhelm; the monarchs' respective coats of arms adorn the upper left and right corners of the page. The royal fraternity featured in the song's marketing must have seemed sadly ironic with a few years' hindsight.

It is not clear whether Eliot has a specific Poe story in mind, but the flinging aside of the gates seems to evoke the reappearance of Madeline Usher, while the visitation of a deceased bride is perhaps most reminiscent of "Ligeia."

The "quotation" is actually anachronistic, for "My Evaline" is the earlier song by four years.

In <i>T. S. Eliot's Silent Voices</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), John T. Mayer writes judiciously on Eliot's ability to "transform people into imaginative presences" (319 n. 38). Eliot's relationship with Verdenal, he claims, was "resurrected in memory and charged with an imaginative power quite beyond the living experience. Verdenal became for a time one of the obsessive res commanding Eliot's inner life . . . It is not so much the living Verdenal whom Eliot knew in Paris but the transmuted Verdenal, the Verdenal of memory and desire, who haunts Eliot as he approached <i>The Waste Land</i>" . I would modify this conclusion, however, by suggesting that Verdenal's role underwent significant preparation <i>before</i> the actor was "cast" in it.

Curiously, the inhabitants of Hampstead are said to be "bound forever on the wheel" because they know too well what to feel and think, while those of London are "bound upon the wheel" because they "Know[] neither how to think, nor how to feel" (<i>WLF,</i> 31). In the end, though, the two criticisms are really one, framed ironically in "The Death of the Duchess" and straightforwardly in "The Fire Sermon." The directness of the latter drew Pound's most scathing comment in the entire <i>Waste Land</i> manuscript: he dismissed this passage, which Eliot had laboriously worked into a sonnet, by scrawling "B&#x02014;ll&#x02014;S" ("Bullshit") in the margin.

As scholars recover traces of London's film culture of the 1920s&#x02014;particularly the connections between the <i>literati</i> and the <i>cin&#x000E9;astes</i>&#x02014;one intriguing re meets us at every turn: Iris Barry. But, she remains somewhat a phantom.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Although scholars have unearthed film work from the late 1920s and early 1930s by H. D., Dorothy Richardson, and Bryher in <i>Close Up,</i><sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  and have shown some interest in Virginia Woolf's 1926 essay, "The Cinema," <sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  we are just beginning to realize the vital role of Iris Barry, born in Birmingham, who came to London to become one of the most prolific and influential res in film forums of her day. Barry led the way in the 1920s as film culture swept London both in print and through that phenomenal cultural institution, the Film Society. Thanks to Iris Barry, cinema was in vogue; cinema was, in fact, in <i>Vogue,</i> the <i>Adelphi,</i> the <i>Spectator,</i> and the <i>Daily Mail.</i> In 1924, she penned her earliest film criticism: two film reviews for the <i>Contributors' Club</i> in the <i>Adelphi</i> for March and April. She went on to write over forty essays for the <i>Spectator</i> in 1924-1927, at least five essays for the British <i>Vogue</i> in 1924-1926, and over sixty columns for the <i>Daily Mail</i> from 1926-1930. Her many articles and her pioneering book, <i>Let's</i> 

<b></b>

<i>Go to the Pictures,</i><sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  published in the autumn of 1926, shaped a generation of cinema enthusiasts. The quantity of Barry's film contributions (around sixty articles and one book between 1924-1926 alone) and the range, from regular columns in newspapers to articles in a high fashion magazine and a little magazine, are staggering (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

By all contemporary accounts, Iris Barry was unforgettable. But, history works in strange ways, as feminist scholars have shown for decades. Resurrecting her from footnotes and archives, this article will foreground Barry's presence and her voice, to allow a new generation of film theorists to hear from this astonishing and prolific public intellectual. Barry was an original, a New Woman writ large: outspoken, bohemian, and intelligent. Self-educated in cinema after a convent school education abroad, she was enterprising, energetic, and inspiring. Years before her cinema book was published and before her leadership role with the Film Society, Barry was a familiar re in London as a writer, poet, and satirical novelist in the bohemian circles of little magazines of the teens; Sidney Bernstein and Ivor Montagu recall: "When the old original film society was conceived . . . Iris was already a literary re on the <i>Spectator,</i> her Bloomsbury parties attended by poets, musicians, critics, artists and gate-crashed by Society res who strove desperately to attach to themselves the epithet 'intellectual' in mitigation of the label 'snob.'"<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  One of the young generation of poets discovered by Ezra Pound,<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  she sent him, as she put it, "a suitcase full" of poetry, some of which appeared in <i>Poetry and Drama, Poetry,</i> the <i>Little Review,</i> the <i>Apple,</i> the <i>Egoist,</i> and <i>Others.</i> She published reviews of plays and a short story, "Grandmother," in the <i>Adelphi.</i> And, she was fascinated by film&#x02014;which she found intellectually stimulating as well as entertaining. At the time, London offered few intelligent essays about cinema&#x02014;other than ones imported from France or in international journals, such as <i>Broom.</i><sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Ivor Montagu points out, "Apart from Iris Barry, who was given a chance to do some film criticism in the <i>Spectator</i> by the Stracheys, there was no film criticism in any of the serious papers."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  As one reviewer of <i>Let's Go to the Pictures</i> suggested, most film essays before Barry were the work of the "dilettante intellectual who has taken up the cinema as a hobby."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Some in the other arts, such as Clive Bell, the art critic, occasionally penned impressions of the cinema,<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  but intellectuals in London did not give film their full critical attention. Then came Iris Barry.
</p>

<p>
In an excerpt from her autobiographical sketch in the Museum of Modern Art Film Studies Center archives, Barry tells how she began writing about film:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Mr. Strachey with his customary dash and foresight felt that "something should be done" by his <i>Spectator</i> to call attention to the currently sad state of the English film and the deplorable consequences and general state of the cinema in England. Articles or even editorials should be written. His son, recently graduated from Oxford and now a member of the <i>Spectator</i> staff, said in his inimitable drawl: "There <i>is</i> a woman whom I have met who <i>seems</i> to know quite a little about the subject. I think we might try her." No sooner said than done. The woman was myself. I had had the pleasure of dining with the Strachey son and his room-mate, Edward Sackville-West not so long before and evidently must have talked a lot, probably perhaps too much, about the movies. . . . So I began to write about movies for the <i>Spectator</i>&#x02014;every week a sort of brief guide to current films&#x02014;the 

<b></b>

title of the film, the movie theatre where it could be seen and a couple of lines of comment, often quite emphatically for or against. As at that time none of us (none of my contemporaries) knew what fear or favour was, the comment was often absolute: avoid this big absurdity at the West End, go and see this other fascinating oddity even if it means making a wearisome journey by tube to an outlying suburb. And there must have been some persistent readers of the lines, as proved by occasional correspondence and fairly frequently telephone calls to the <i>Spectator</i> on the subject. Soon, the paper commissioned me to write occasional articles or reviews of films and at the same time I wrote occasionally on the same topic for <i>Vogue,</i> thanks to the interest of the American editress, Miss Dorothy Todd and her assistant Miss Madge Garland.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

Barry was, as one reviewer stated, something quite new on the scene: "a thoroughly well-equipped, well-informed and whole-time professional cinema critic."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Her prolific and influential forays into film almost single-handedly shaped the film culture of England, initiating lively interest in the new art. Soon, Barry, Aldous Huxley, Bonamy Dobr&#x000E9;e&#x02014;and Anon&#x02014;discussed cinema and its future in the British <i>Vogue</i> and beyond.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p> 

<p>
Meanwhile, the excitement about cinema moved beyond the printed page; Iris Barry became active as a founder of the Film Society. Inaugurated in 1925, this private subscription screening society brought film to the forefront of London culture. It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of the Film Society to film forums in 

<b></b>

London of the 1920s&#x02014;or Iris Barry's role within that scene. Montagu explains why Barry was a crucial part of the effort: "It was as <i>Spectator</i> critic and, of course, because nearly all of us knew her and she knew everybody, that we asked her to join our crusade."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Barry's colorful description of the genesis of the Film Society captures the threshold moment:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It began with a telephone call from an unknown person&#x02014;a man who said that his name was Ivor Montagu, that he had been lunching with Hugh Miller the actor and that they both wanted to come and talk to me. About the cinema. About something to do with the cinema. And as the cinema was one of the things that interested me most at the time, to a degree which most of my friends regarded as eccentricity or mania, I said that they had both better come round at once and have tea with me so that we could talk. . . .
<p class="blockquote">
Briefly what Montagu said was this: there exists in London a distinguished and successful Stage Society. Let us found a Film Society which like the former will give programs on Sundays&#x02014;but in the afternoons&#x02014;to its subscribers. In this way we could show to an intelligent audience which we must suppose to exist the quantities of films new and old, American or foreign, which now remain unseen or perish miserably for want of the right audience or, indeed, are entirely forbidden or mercilessly mutilated by the censor.
<p class="blockquote">
My agreement was immediate and enthusiastic and we got out pencils and paper at once to sketch a program of action. <sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Not limited to <i>cin&#x000E9;astes,</i> the Film Society involved intellectuals from all the arts, and the screenings touched visual artists, critics, and poets. Montagu remembers the Society's strategy this way, "we could draw into film, artists, sculptors, writers, who up to then disdained films. Films were in general disdained. It was supposed to be low taste. Intellectual snobs would have nothing to do with film but of course when it was organized on the lines of the Film Society, they poured in."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Promises of support came from an impressive roll call of Lords and Ladies as well as res from art and literature such as H. G. Wells, Noel Coward, Bernard Shaw, Julian Huxley, Roger Fry, Lydia Lopokova, Maynard Keynes, and Eddy Sackville-West. The first performance of the first season of the Film Society was at 2:30 <small class="caps">P.M.</small> on Sunday, 25 October 1925, in the New Gallery Kinema in Regent Street; Ivor Montagu recalls the scene: "Half the snobs in London, intellectual and social, were at the opening. Iris, who had flung herself into the thick of the battle, more than held her own in a tall black super-poke hat with a wide brim and wide scarlet ribbon, like a witch."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In a memoir capturing the fervor surrounding the early days, Montagu recalled Frank Dobson's report of a "riot" involving Clive Bell at the 17 January 1926 performance.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In <i>Close Up,</i> H.D. in 1927 wrote fondly of "those admirable Sunday afternoon performances of the London Film Society."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  From the rather cavalier beginnings described in Barry's notes, the Film Society became a stunning success. Lest we think the screenings were a small group of devoted <i>cin&#x000E9;astes,</i> Montagu informs us, "Our Sundays became so fashionable we had to transfer after a few seasons from the New Gallery to the Tivoli, from a cinema holding 1,400 to one accommodating between two and three thousand."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
The Film Society brought modernists together in an electric cultural moment. It had ambitious&#x02014;and at times competing&#x02014;agendas:<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  to make film more upscale, to 

<b></b>

get around the ubiquitous censorship, to encourage intellectual film criticism and viewing, to stimulate the trade to market better films, and to show potential British filmmakers what such films were like. The Society mediated between highbrow, mainstream, and avant-garde elements. Programs reveal an eclectic mix: newsreels of yesteryear, science shorts, revivals of vintage Hollywood films, groundbreaking international films not otherwise available in England, farces, satires, and experimental avant-garde films. They embody Iris Barry's wide-ranging love of all cinema. The performances and conversations about them left their traces in diaries, letters, and memoirs, as well as more lasting artifacts: publications. Film Society performances were reviewed in publications as diverse as the <i>London Mercury,</i> the <i>Nation &amp; Athenaeum, Close Up, Vogue,</i> and <i>Kine-Weekly.</i><sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The performances and reviews introduced films that became touchstones in cinema essays: <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Entr'acte, Ballet m&#x000E9;canique,</i> the <i>Secrets of Nature</i> shorts, and assorted other films. Cross-references to these films in writings by various intellectuals show how the Film Society and the coterie culture around it shared and shaped film discourse.</p>

High society <i>Vogue</i> touted the Film Society. In late December 1925, Bonamy Dobr&#x000E9;e in "Seen on the Stage," added an important section entitled "The Film Society" which reviewed the 2<sup>d</sup> program and meditated upon the role of the Society: "There is no reason why this <i>Cinderella</i> should not be a popular favourite. But the Film Society exists, presumably, to give us films that could never be popular, to do for the cinema what the Stage Society has done for plays."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In late January 1926, he highlighted the Film Society, sketching the frenetic pace for the cultural voyeur:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Sunday, December 20<sup>th</sup>, should go down to history as a veritable St. Bartholomew of the cultured. There was scarcely a moment when the protestants of art were left to peaceful sloth. Lunch hurriedly swallowed, we were up and off to the Film Society, chiefly to see the much advertised German film <i>Raskolnikov,</i> produced by the director of <i>Dr. Caligari.</i><sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
After a damning review of <i>Raskolnikov,</i> he notes that on the same program Comte Etienne de Beaumont showed the first of his new films ["<i>A quoi r&#x000EA;vent les jeunes films?</i>"]; Dobr&#x000E9;e argues that "in his attempt to abolish all literary significance from film-drama and rely simply on speed, light and form, he is moving in the right direction and away from the German art film."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  <i>Vogue</i> regularly praises Film Society programs; "The Future of the Cinema," in Early March 1926, highlights its central role: "The Film Society has now given enough performances for one to be able to judge the present state of the Art of the Cinema."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Though Barry could complain in 1925 in a <i>Spectator</i> column, "the cinema lacks <i>chic,</i>"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  that was no longer the case by 1926. <i>Kine-Weekly</i> complained in late 1925 that the Film Society was highbrow and Ivor Montagu bristled in reply.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Yet one could not deny that the high fashion and highbrows certainly did take up the Society in 1925 and 1926, as articles and reviews in <i>Vogue</i> indicate. Published discussions of film dramatically changed between 1924 and 1926, no doubt in part because in that interval, Barry's dynamic presence&#x02014;in person at the Film Society, and in print&#x02014;helped to transform London's intellectual film culture. In this pivotal two year period, intellectuals became eager to engage with film; for example, the <i>London Mercury</i> embraced the movies as one of its <i>Chronicles</i> beginning in November 1925.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In <i>Vogue</i> in Late December 1925 and Late January 1926, two subtitles of the regular feature, "Paris Screens and Footlights," focus on film: "The Ballet "Rel&#x000E2;che" and an Exciting Film at the Champs Elys&#x000E9;es: Mme. Georgette Leblanc in "L'Inhumaine,"<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  and "Two of the Latest Plays Follow the Old Traditions of the Paris Stage, while an Extraordinary Film is the Newest Achievement of the Ultra-Modern School." <sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The landmark year, 1926, found film between the sheets of several of the most influential little magazines. The <i>New Criterion</i><sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  turned attention to the cinema in January; Walter Hanks Shaw's "Cinema and Ballet in Paris " offered a glimpse into the world of French avant-garde film. That conversational spark plug, the <i>Little Review,</i> in its winter issue, celebrated avant-garde film in articles by experimental directors, such as Fernand L&#x000E9;ger, Richter, and de Beaumont, on the object, rhythm, and abstract cinema.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  In June and July of that year, Virginia Woolf published a meditation on cinema in <i>Arts</i> and the <i>Nation &amp; Athenaeum</i> (and, without her permission, in the <i>New Republic</i>), and in September Gilbert Seldes reviewed her essay in the <i>New Republic</i>. <sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
What happened between 1924 and 1926? It began with Iris Barry, in the <i>Adelphi.</i>
</p>

<h3 class="aHead">
<!--_aHead-->
The <i>Adelphi</i>
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The lively <i>Adelphi,</i> edited by John Middleton Murry, began to consider cinema in the October 1923 issue: "Why is it, I wonder, that there is no real criticism of the 

<b></b>

cinema?"<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  That spring, Iris Barry answered the call and offered <i>Adelphi</i> readers "real criticism of the cinema" in the form of two film reviews which appeared in the <i>Contributors' Club</i> section in March and April of 1924.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Preceding her columns in the <i>Spectator,</i> these were her first sustained film essays, introducing her distinctive voice, with its self-assured humor, risk-taking, and intimate camaraderie. These first essays indicate the direction her later film criticism would take; they combine her keen observations of the cinematic apparatus with her analysis of the psychological experience of film viewing. "Three Films" begins with a characteristically disarming conversational tone; she anchors her analysis in her immediate experience as a thoughtful spectator, rather than in impersonal abstractions: "I often consider, when I am in the cinema, how much each unique individual sitting in the darkness there, watching that representation of other interacting individuals on the screen, resembles the solitary creatures who sit at home behind a veil of window-curtains, peeping out at passers-by" (TF," 926). Her analysis of the pleasures and drawbacks of voyeurism anticipates our discussions of the cinema voyeur, as she draws parallels between the Peeping Tom and the spectator; both, she argues, share "something common" and she ventures: "I think the curiosity is to know how life is lived: its resources" ("TF," 927). But, again characteristically, she finds cinema more rewarding than real life for the voyeur, because film spectators experience more complex psychological dynamics: "At least the watchers in the cinema get more satisfaction; for there, besides the spectacle of moving creatures they are constantly drawn out of themselves by a vicarious participation in the action of the play, and they are sometimes drawn into themselves to comment and reflect upon the causes and effects of the action, to judge what truth there is for themselves personally in the play" ("TF," 927).
</p>

<p>
In her inaugural essay, Barry critiques the Hollywood films of Tom Mix and German films: <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Street,</i> and <i>Destiny.</i> The selection of films for this first essay&#x02014;German producers and Hollywood&#x02014;is significant, setting forth interests that continue throughout her career. In her analysis, she moves beyond the superficial thrill that action films produce in spectators in order to make astute judgments about their more nuanced psychological effects: "The films of pure action, for example, those of Tom Mix, are exhilarating as a toboggan-ride, a sort of Cook's Tour of the mind. But recollection of them fades because these films of uninspired action are a drawing-out of the spectator to a world where he has no point of reference. The pictures that remain most in the memory are those in which the action crystallises an attitude to life, and evokes a judgment on what is done, drawing something inwards to add to the spectator's own conscious experience" ("TF," 927). Her meditation on that prototype of art films, <i>The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari,</i> traces the film's impact on the mind of the viewer: "<i>Is</i> life like that to a madman? I ask, looking outwards. And, what then is life like to me? I add, looking inwards. Perhaps it is only in degree less like reality than the madman's story is like fact. I suddenly doubt the evidence of my senses, which I had thoughtlessly accepted as testimony on the appearance of the world: it is good and important that I should doubt that evidence. The film is a new point of reference for me: a dream that colours waking life" ("TF," 928). Expanding the mind in ways unique 

<b></b>

to the modern moment, film is, according to Barry, a learning experience for the attentive viewer; she probes the interplay between the film and the critical consciousness of such an astute spectator. Choosing to use "I" to designate such a spectator, Barry forges an intimate bond with readers, bringing them into the immediate experience of viewing and learning along with her.
</p>

<p>
Barry develops this intimacy by foregrounding the personality quirks of her film critic persona&#x02014;including her passions and pet peeves. She is at her most provocative when she challenges the usual mores; for example she mates sensuality and morality in a surprise coupling when she writes of <i>The Street</i>: "I thought: this is the most refreshingly sensual and the most moral film I have ever seen . . ." ("TF," 928). Condemning hackneyed treatments of moral dilemmas and simplistic romantic plots, she leads into her discussion of <i>Destiny</i> with the reflection, "And then I wondered if romance could ever be destroyed and idealism still retained" ("TF," 928-9). Praising the "skilful devices" that link the subsidiary love tales and "an appropriate use of Freudian symbolism" in the film, she is not ashamed to admit, "I was glad, too, that this piece had this kind of 'happy ending'" ("TF," 929). Moving from the intimate to the general, Barry closes her essay with thought-provoking reflections about the state of the medium: "These German producers have been the first to appreciate how much more than mere spectators a cinema audience can be moved to become, though others have claimed more noisily that cinematography is an art. It can be" ("TF," 929).
</p>

<p>
Barry's second contribution to film criticism, "The Woman of Paris," in the April 1924 <i>Adelphi,</i> sets up a focus that will fill many of her later essays: her analysis of the production apparatus of film. She probes the effects of corporate production on a film's aesthetics and unity: "Most films are the work not of any one person, but of a corporation. <i>A</i> invents a plot: <i>B</i> writes the scenario: <i>C</i> directs the acting, chooses the sets. The actors themselves frequently have no clear idea of what they are supposed to be doing. When the string of photographs is assembled, pruned, along comes <i>D</i> to add the subtitles" ("WP," 1009). Then, anticipating auteur theory of mid-century, she praises the director, Charles Chaplin, for challenging that disjointed corporate model: "The first merit of Chaplin's film, <i>The Woman of Paris,</i> is that it is the work of one man and the expression of a single individual's unromantic but generous view of humanity" ("WP," 1009). Though she admits, "I do not pretend this unassuming plot has much value," she finds much to praise: "the telling of it in picture-phrases which suggest the whole nature of the characters, the resourceful development of minute situations, and the indications of atmosphere are masterly. There is hardly an inch of unnecessary explanation" ("WP," 1010). Impatient with humbug and sentimentality, Barry welcomes the psychological authenticity of this film: "each incident of action is based on a convincing revelation of its psychological cause" ("WP," 1010). And, as an advocate for the intelligent (rather than intellectually elite) cinema audience, she claims, "Chaplin really understands the eloquence of the moving-picture, and he is the one American producer who does not underrate the intelligence of his audience" ("WP," 1010). Barry praises Chaplin for eliminating "stock-types to the dustbin"; she argues against screen-characters who are "the mere personification of an attribute" because she finds that 

<b></b>

such personifications diminish the drama: "they are labeled <i>thief, sailor, jealous husband,</i> and when they are neither thieving, hitching up their slacks, nor out-husbanding Othello, they do nothing, have no existence apart from their 'humour'" ("WP," 1010). Close viewing and analysis back up her points. Barry ends once again on a note that moves from the specific to general speculations about cinema: "If a poor film is one which merely distracts the sight, and a good film one which also intrigues the imagination, as I believe, then this, while brilliant rather than profound, is a notable one" ("WP," 1011).

The <i>Spectator</i>
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Barry's regular film articles in the <i>Spectator</i> from 1924-1927 fed into her ground breaking book, <i>Let's Go to the Pictures,</i> published in the Fall of 1926. Ranging between 600 and 1,500 words, these essays allow for rhetorical maneuvering and development of an argument. In her inaugural article, "A Comparison of Arts," of 3 May 1924,<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Barry&#x02014;with characteristic verve&#x02014;takes on the formidable task of evaluating the arts to establish cinema's claims to be one of them. Her feisty tone in the first lines indicates that she intends to pull no punches: "Some glib fraud long ago invented the detestable phrase "the silent stage," as though the cinema were nothing more than the theatre docked of its words. Yet partisan comparisons between the cinema and the stage are actually rather unfair to the stage, because the cinema has so much wider a scope" ("CA," 707). From the defensive posture <i>cin&#x000E9;astes</i> adopted in response to the dismissive rhetoric of the established arts, Barry shifts to an assertive stance, as she challenges the traditional hierarchies and rhetoric. Quick to find compensations for any supposed advantages of theatre, she dismisses the use of the spoken word as "not essential" and argues that, even if it were, "ideally the visual beauty of a film should be the aesthetic alternative to the stage's poetry" ("CA," 707). Imagining ideal future films, she claims, "I can conceive of films throughout which pictures of ineffable loveliness should continually melt into each other. There will be such films yet" ("CA," 707). But, she does not limit her advocacy to the future of cinema; she celebrates the promise of current film "in one flash of conscious pictorial organization (the groupings of some choristers) in <i>Rosita,</i> in the perspectives and architecture of <i>Caligari,</i> in the coordinated movement on many planes of the crowds in <i>The Golem</i> and in a treatment of landscape in <i>The White Sister</i>" ("CA," 707). She argues that one cannot make qualitative judgments between works in different media: "it seems to me idle to insist that the cinema is inferior, artistically, to the stage: as idle, since the difference is one of medium, as to claim that Tchekov is a greater artist than Van Gogh" ("CA," 707). Her point that one cannot make such qualitative distinctions does not stop her, however, from pointing out the advantages of film. The essay relies upon scientific evidence to support her assertions: "Visual imagery, less primitive and more sophisticated than auditory, is also sharper, more rapid, richer, and more permanent" ("CA," 707). Barry is quite optimistic that in the future the alliance between science and art will advance film rather than theatre: "when the cinema is tuned up to the acute visual machinery of the public, then I think it will be a very exceptional stage-play indeed which will give 

<b></b>

in dialogue anything like the delicate analysis of character, the diverse, minute and intuitive flashes into behaviour by which the films of the future, solely by means of pictures, will express drama" ("CA," 707). Responding to theatre's purported advantages, Barry argues, "the personal presence of the actors on the stage is compensated by the cinema's increased intimacy, by the possibility of seeing the actor's every gesture and changing expression and, more, his very thoughts in concrete form" ("CA," 707). And, she finds that the stage's spatial confinement is inferior to cinema's spatial expanse: "the world of the screen is not only spatially unconfined, it is a fuller world than that of the theatre. It has infinite variety of scene, endless angles of vision and focuses, it can use for its own ends all the resources of landscape and architecture" ("CA," 707). In addition, she argues, cinema&#x02014;through artful exploitation of the close-up&#x02014;can make objects come alive in its art: "The dramatic advantage of having Desdemona's handkerchief a protagonist, not a property, is obvious" ("CA," 707). It is strategic&#x02014;and amusing&#x02014;that she uses an image from a canonical play to make her point; along with the reference to Van Gogh, the reference to Shakespeare adds a touch of class to cinema by association. Her parting shot at theatre suggests that the battle between theatre and film is, for her, no contest: "So psychologically satisfying is cinematographic drama that, were it a question of mere rivalry, were it not that the theatre is a totally different art-form, fulfilling a different function, I feel positive that, not only would the movies already have invaded certain West End theatres, but that, before long, there would be no regular theatre at all" ("CA," 707).

Barry's second article for the <i>Spectator,</i> "Hope Fulfilled" of 17 May 1924,<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  again presents her delicious combination of advocacy and analysis, as she considers Lubitsch's <i>The Marriage Circle.</i> She begins by brainstorming about criteria for comedy in any medium, noting that "a really efficient comedy&#x02014;in which there is perception behind the wit and a perfect rounding of the action so that nothing irrelevant or forced mars the bright sparkle&#x02014;is a rare thing" ("HF," 788). Naming authors of theatrical comedies, such as Congreve, the essay enhances the status of film by association. Though she admits that earlier films offered "only the succulent fun of the music-hall and the circus, not the dry wit of the true comedy," she insists, "<i>The Marriage Circle</i> may well silence those who claim that the film cannot compare as dramatic form with the stage-play" ("HF," 788). As she often does in her essays, here she takes on the persona of a cinema advocate, an ardent guide who professes an intelligent love for pictures. The rhetorical strategy is complex. Through an intimate conversation with the reader, Barry forges a "we" led by the writer, in league against those hidebound reactionaries still doubting the artistry of film ("those who claim . . . "). By setting up anti-film persons as res to laugh at or to pity, or by removing them offscreen, she undercuts their authority. Rather than addressing them herself, which would give them the status of adversaries, Barry delegates to her readers the job of converting the misguided, though she provides her deputy-readers with arguments and strategies for leading the opponents to picture palaces. 
</p>

<p>
Barry asserts that <i>The Marriage Circle</i> "is at once perfect cinematography and perfect conventional drama," that it "has shown, not told the story" ("HF," 788). She lauds 

<b></b>

the way gestures and situations, presented visually, wittily develop the plot. Arguing for the primacy of the visual, she brings in a theatrical example again, only to undercut it: "Of course, the story is not very edifying. But then neither <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> or <i>The Way of the World</i> is exactly a Sunday School narrative" ("HF," 788). Claiming that the film perfectly captures the subtle nuances of "the psychology of motive," Barry argues, in a deft rhetorical coup, that her very difficulty to describe how film works proves the limits of words and the supremacy of the visual: "any attempt at a verbal description at once demonstrates the superiority of the pictorial over the verbal method of telling such a story. Henry James could, in a light mood, have told it as minutely as Lubitsch has in pictures: but at what a length. I do not believe that any dramatist living or dead could relate it in dialogue quite so delicately, so intuitively or so effortlessly as this unpretentious film does" ("HF," 788). From that rather audacious thought, she leaps to another: "Therefore, I cannot understand why not one of our playwrights or novelists has yet been attracted to this subtle new method of dramatic expression and of story telling" ("HF," 788). Here she turns the tables on the familiar dynamic of a writer berating a director for failing to do justice to literature in a film adaptation. Rather than arguing that filmmakers should learn from literature, she argues that authors should learn from&#x02014;and write for&#x02014;cinema. Reversing the traditional hierarchy of the arts, in which literature is high status and film low, she dares to advocate that writers be students and directors, professors: "Possibly some of our writers will see <i>The Marriage Circle</i> and be convinced that there really is an unequalled opportunity for self-expression in the medium of a film. I even hope that subsequently a few of them will unite in presenting a humble petition to one of the seven producers of genius there are (the names are Lang, Grune, Wiene, Lubitsch, Chaplin, Griffiths and Seastrom) to be allowed to go to school under them in their studios and learn the business of writing for the screen. The great and lonely seven might well admit reinforcements" ("HF," 788). Thus humbling writers and elevating filmmakers, Barry mandates a shocking about-face for elitist literary modernists.

<p>
An overview of Barry's over forty <i>Spectator</i> essays demonstrates her wide range and varied roles in film culture. The essays cluster around several persistent themes and rely upon a repertoire of rhetorical strategies, but they all work to forward Barry's ambitious agenda for cinema. As a self-proclaimed "cinema enthusiast," Barry&#x02014;with missionary zeal and great good humor&#x02014;clarifies her role as a proselytizer for cinema in essays permeated by such telling terms as "missionary," "unbelievers" and "convert." <sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In the guise of cinema advocate, she encourages other members of the public to become ardent activists, to speak up as consumers for the films they want, and to protest those they do not want.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In essays such as "Sublimity Versus Vulgarity," she plays the impatient reviewer, scathingly panning Hollywood catastrophes.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Considering film from the point of view of aesthetic theory, she places film&#x02014;to its advantage&#x02014;alongside the other arts. Committed to enhancing the status of cinema, she uses a double move to raise cinema's status while deflating the status of the more reputable arts. <sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  She writes against literary adaptations, believing that the cinema would be better served by writers writing scenarios directly for the screen;<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  she crusades for 

<b></b>

writers to write for film. <sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Eager for cinema to develop, Barry celebrates innovations and avant-garde experiments as necessary means for refining and developing the medium of film.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Taking on the role of industry analyst, she evaluates the British film industry, and suggests ways to salvage and encourage it.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  And, donning the hat of social theorist, she examines the social role of cinema in modern nerve-wracked culture.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Ever the educator, she wants to teach spectators how to appreciate art in all films, and to teach those in the trade, directors, producers, and others, how to make good films.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In her many guises, Barry works to encourage the growth of intelligent and active institutions around cinema, from an informed and demanding public to intelligent writers well trained in the specific art of scenario writing. Always the cinema optimist, she celebrates the positive elements in individual films and in the industry as a whole that advance the medium.

<i>Vogue</i> (British)

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
That <i>Vogue</i>&#x02014;the quintessential female fashion publication aimed at upscale women&#x02014;played a role fashioning the interest in film as an art, is surely significant. Dorothy Todd, visionary editor of the British <i>Vogue</i> from 1922-1926, celebrated Bloomsbury highbrow culture<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  and the new art of cinema.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  The magazine fashioned film as another modernist must-have cultural accessory for the intelligent, chic modern woman. Under Todd, <i>Vogue</i> was high fashion in ideas as well as apparel; as the editor reminds readers in the Early October 1925 issue, "But there are other fashions to be observed as well as the fashions of our frocks and coats, hats and shoes. The fashions of the mind are also to be considered." <sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  From mainstream film to the avant-garde, film graced the British <i>Vogue</i> during the highbrow era of Todd, encroaching on&#x02014;and at times displacing&#x02014;the theatre columns. In her influential series of <i>Vogue</i> essays of 1924-1926, Barry both shaped and critiqued the <i>Vogue</i> fashioning of cinema. 
</p>

<p>
Iris Barry truly launches film in <i>Vogue</i> in Late August 1924, with a featured space in the Contents (albeit under the heading <i>Miscellaneous</i>). In this issue, <i>Vogue</i> offers a film spread, including "Seen on the Screen," a full page of mainstream film star photos and stills from <i>The Bright Shawl,</i> a film adaptation starring Dorothy Gish, and a smaller still from "He and Ski,"<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  a "disguised travel film." The spread continues with Barry's pioneering article, "The Scope of the Cinema," illustrated with stills from <i>The Niebelungs.</i> <sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  This essay is a skillful intervention to dismiss any lingering doubts that film is worthy of serious critical and artistic appreciation. The opening line claims the lure of cinema for the intellectual and artistic aristocracy and offers an explanation for it: "It is really no wonder that numbers of well-known writers, and artists too, go frequently to the cinema, when it provides them not only with an easily obtainable mental distraction but also stores up layers of experience, of local colour, in their subconscious minds for use in the future" ("SC," 65). Strategically, Barry associates film with the more reputable arts to raise its status&#x02014;as would H.D. and Dorothy Richardson a few years later in <i>Close Up.</i> She compares movies to literature, finding the appeal of cinema to be more immediate because "the moving picture is really extraordinary"; it 

<b></b>

is "entertaining in the good old way by telling a story, and telling it in the most vivid way&#x02014;that is, directly to the eye in pictures" ("SC," 65). Dismissing the shady past of the movies, Barry focuses on the dramatic changes in the short history of cinema, finding that film has evolved to play a significant role meeting the needs of the uniquely modern consciousness: "The cinema, from the penny-in-the-slot affair it was twenty-five years ago, has become not only the regular entertainment of millions of people, but a dream into which everyone can dissolve while retaining as much consciousness as he chooses" ("SC," 65). Associating film with modern psychology, she finds that it enriches the storehouse of the subconscious, and provides immersion in the dream-state. She claims it as one of the "psychological necessities of modern humanity," asserting in a parenthetical aside: "(for it is obvious that the cinema would not have established itself as it has but for the fact that it does in some way solve the complexes of our age)" ("SC," 65). According to Barry, travel films and News Pictorials, "with their thrilling and often beautiful scraps of information on the method of counting blood-cells, the manufacture of battleships and bangkok hats, the form of champion tennis players and the manner of the newest frocks," broaden the life experience of the spectators ("SC," 65).
</p>

<p>
But, Barry continues, even the film-play proper is not mere entertainment, but has artistic merit of different sorts depending on the type of film, "from the pageantry of <i>Robin Hood, Scaramouche,</i> and <i>The Fall of an Empress,</i> with their vast swirling crowds and their historical atmosphere, from the cold visual beauty of <i>The Niebelungs,</i> that dignified German screen-epic of the Dragon era of Europe's past, to the riotous farces of Buster Keaton" ("SC," 76). She insists that some films could pass the test of a canonical aesthetic authority: "The first, painted in on a broad canvas, obey many of Aristotle's dramatic canons" ("SC," 76). And, she claims a social and psychological function for film: "the farces, which are to our time what the circus was to our ancestors, provide surely the pleasantest wish-fulfilment ever devised for the amusement of mankind" ("SC," 76). Barry demonstrates the scope of cinema by asserting that "every mentality is catered for between those two extremes, in the melodramas which the cinema presents so much more effectively than Drury Lane can, in the social satires, the sex dramas, the Wild West films with their exciting <i>tempos</i> (rushing express trains, avalanches, motor-dashes, aeroplane ts and what not), in the witty comedies of Constance Talmadge, the fantasy of <i>Felix the Cat,</i> and the very intellectual films of Charles Chaplin" ("SC," 76). If cinema can accommodate every mentality, according to Barry, it can also meet the needs of all classes: "City men slip away (you can see them in the West End cinemas any afternoon) to follow the allure of roguish Mae Murray or drop an easy tear for a white-haired mother. Typists wallow in the supposed goings-on of the very smart, and the very smart safely court danger in the squalor of a Bowery crook's life" ("SC," 76). Film thus allows for class mobility, albeit fleeting and in fantasy. 
</p>

<p>
At the core of Barry's essay is her claim for the aesthetic quality of film; "here and there on the screen in any of these films may flash a fugitive beauty," a beauty unique to "a story told in motion" ("SC," 76). This beauty is new to art through the medium of 

<b></b>

film: "in the various rhythms of speed as well as in the more obvious 'artistic' staging the film-producer can now and again capture for us both psychological and visible loveliness" ("SC," 76). Barry expresses eagerness to see films coming from Germany that "experiment with the yet undiscovered possibilities of the cinema as a new form of expression" ("SC," 76). Exploiting another literary link, she draws parallels between the landmark art film, <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,</i> and a well-known literary touchstone: "<i>Caligari,</i> an old story now, but important in the history of the cinema, was frankly futurist and achieved in pictures what Poe did in words." Catholic in her taste, Barry celebrates the merit in most films; "But there are delights for the eye in almost all films; a still-life on the screen, beautiful in itself, takes on a fresh beauty because of its dramatic importance; the whole resources of sea and landscape may be selected by an artist&#x02014;for some producers are artists&#x02014;as a background to the action, and the characters may so move and thread their way, in the story, through the scene that both it and they acquire new value, stimulate vivid flashes of imagination in the spectator" ("SC," 76). If Barry waxes eloquent about the ravishing scope of current cinema, she is even more enthusiastic about the films of the future, noting with relish that American films have begun to "capture atmosphere and to wean the camera at last from its tendency to insist on realism" ("SC," 76). Cinema is on the cusp of even greater achievements, she finds: "all good new films promise something so unique, so little understood by any of us as yet, that it is with growing interest that one follows the development of a real film-technique, that one notes the broadening of the cinema's inspiration and scope" ("SC," 76). Barry's celebratory essay leaves little outside the scope of the cinema.

Though it is not listed in the Contents, the Late September 1924 issue of <i>Vogue</i> contains another article by Iris Barry, "The Autumn Cinema," occupying a half page juxtaposed with an advertisement for Elizabeth Arden.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  In this piece, once again Barry covers a range of topics in cinema, from a discussion of mainstream period films such as <i>Monsieur Beaucaire</i> starring Valentino, to a witty diatribe against false and stereotyped films of Spain, and a tribute to the brilliant German actor, Emil Jennings, in <i>The Last Laugh</i> (named <i>The Last Man</i> here). Aware of the poor repute of the British film industry, she comments encouragingly on the British picture, "Decameron Nights," and urges another British producer, the young Adrian Brunel, to produce more of his witty, satiric films, such as the "brilliant skit on travel films, <i>Crossing the Great Sagrada,</i> [which] "made all Wardour Street weak with astonished merriment when it was shown privately."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

Another piece by Iris Barry, "The Cinema in Three Moods,"<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  graces the Early October 1924 issue; it is further back in the magazine and, again, juxtaposed with a half page advertisement for Elizabeth Arden. Adroitly aligning herself with readers and viewers, she begins with a characteristic demand that 'we' must adjust 'our' attitude to cinema:

We shall have to stop generalizing about "films." In the earlier days of the moving picture types of plays were narrowly confined to farce (in which, as in the children's game, "they all fall down"), sentimental comedy of the serving-maid to society-woman order, melodrama of two varieties&#x02014;one with a baby and a rainstorm, the other with either a railway 

<b></b>

smash or a heroine rescued by cowboys&#x02014;and historical or costume pieces with slight regard for accuracy. They were all "films"; you paid your money and you got a mental rest and probably a fairly crude emotional tonic. But to-day a joyous differentiation has begun. The old banalities persist, but since pretty well fifteen hundred films are made every twelve months it is not so astonishing that some really good films of diverse kinds should up out of the crowd now and then.

The essay analyzes three moods of mainstream films: Lubitsch's light social satire, <i>The Marriage Circle,</i> Douglas Fairbanks in <i>The Thief of Baghdad,</i> and Frances Marion's conception, the historical drama, <i>Abraham Lincoln.</i> Lubitsch she admires: "The whole thing is a beautifully managed succession of witty situations, and, best of all, it is pure cinematography. Lubitsch 'says it with pictures'" ("CT," 104). Praising Fairbanks's incorporation of German films' romance of chiaroscura, she finds that "the shadows in <i>The Thief of Baghdad</i> are the most beautiful part of it; they, more than any spectacle, evoke fantasy, speak to the imagination" ("CT," 104). With her signature wit, Barry adds: "And, being tedious, I reiterate that it is only in so far as the moving picture stimulates, in some way or other, the imagination that it is good. The cinema is not, properly, a continuous peep-show of the obvious" ("CT," 104). She ends the essay with another jibe at those who still fail to appreciate the art of cinema: "And so one would say, if there are still unregenerates who scoff at the power of the picture-drama, that they should be somehow led to see <i>Abraham Lincoln.</i> They will not scoff as they come out; and afterwards they can be taken unresisting to see, a pungent contrast, Lubitsch's <i>The Marriage Circle.</i>" ("CT," 104).

A half page illustration in the <i>Vogue</i> Table of Contents for Early January 1925 demonstrates the rising cultural cachet of cinema: a fashionable society woman runs a movie projector, showing a film of fashion models.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  The triangle of projected light forms the "V" for <i>Vogue</i>. In this issue, cinema is decidedly upscale, highbrow, and avant-garde. Bonamy Dobr&#x000E9;e's regular column, "Seen on the Stage,"<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  in a significant switch, focuses on films instead of plays. Another regular item, "Paris Screens and Footlights," describing the Swedish ballet, notes that "an interval in the ballet was gloriously filled with a film by MM. Picabia and Ren&#x000E9; Clair . . . [<i>Entr'acte</i>] which had all the charm and inconsequence of a dream; avant garde and arri&#x000E8;re garde could meet on a common Freudian basis here."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Continuing to examine the film milieu in Paris, the article notes, "the cinema proved the most adequate purveyor of the truly modern thrill."<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  In Early January and Early February 1925, "Paris Screens and Footlights" foregrounds avant-garde cinema, celebrating <i>Entr'acte</i> by Rene Clair, <i>L'Inhumaine</i> by L'Herbier, and <i>Ballet m&#x000E9;canique</i> by Fernand L&#x000E9;ger and Dudley Murphy.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
In response, perhaps, to <i>Vogue's</i> hyperbolic celebration of the avant-garde in the issues before, Barry's essay, "The Cinema Continues to Improve," in Late February 1925, attempts to shift attention to the broader film-going public and the film industry.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  This is the third of Barry's essays in <i>Vogue</i> to share a page with an advertisement for Elizabeth Arden&#x02014;an interesting juxtaposition, because as Elizabeth Arden shapes the appropriate modern body, Barry's articles hope to shape the appropriate viewer (see <a href="#2"> 2</a>). If the Elizabeth Arden advertisement on the left urges self-improvement 

<b></b>

for the body, asserting, "Every woman wants a <i>lovely re,</i>" Barry's essay on the right extols a self-improvement plan for film. Here, Barry suggests that film is doing quite well on its improvement plan; she asserts: "The curve of merit has been bent sharply upwards in this past year" ("CC," 78). Rather than repeating familiar charges that film is in poor shape, Barry praises the positive and the exemplary: "Nothing could have been more encouraging than the public success of perhaps the most lovely and serious film yet exhibited, <i>Warning Shadows</i>" ("CC," 78). She claims that active spectators and more aware film producers are responsible for the improvements: "many of the producers have realised that a film is neither a stage-play photographed with the words left out, nor a bare illustration of a novel, but an entirely new means of telling a story by related pictorial compositions which strike direct, through the eye, to the mind" ("CC," 78). Lauding cinema and cinema enthusiasts, she asserts, "The enthusiasts who clamoured all along that the cinema is a mishandled but stupendous form of art-expression are gaining adherents daily" ("CC," 78). Instead of condemning Hollywood, she welcomes its capacity to grow, and has high hopes for film as a social force: "the cinema ought to bring to every individual an intensification of life, all kinds of vicarious experience denied by the ever-narrowing grooves in which a mechanical civilisation fixes us" ("CC," 78). And, in a claim sure to please both movie enthusiasts and avant-garde intellectuals, she praises Chaplin, claiming "his is high if not classical art" ("CC," 78).

The essay proper, subtitled "Eloquence Without Words&#x02014;The New Film, 'Stella Dallas'&#x02014;Strauss and the Operatic Picture, 'Der Rosenkavalier,'" offers a wide ranging survey of current film. Barry notes, "The cinema is young and full of possibilities," and claims that one of those possibilities is "its ability to give the world great histrionic performances, differing from those of the stage, but as eloquent in its silences as anything the footlights ever shone upon. By gesture, poise of body, shade of facial expression, it can (but too seldom does) give us drama to stir all the emotions" ("C," 53). She celebrates the popularity of film as evidence that it is a democratic art: "Low comedy has, however, so far been the strong suit of the cinema, as of those other democratic entertainments, the circus and the music hall" ("C," 53).

film, <i>Stella Dallas,</i> arguing, "for the first time a film which will obviously be popular, easily understood, which is a melodrama pure and simple, can claim the distinction of being thoroughly well played throughout" ("C," 53). Barry offers a succinct critical manifesto: "The fact that it is above no one's head is a merit. The cinema is (though we give thanks for all daring experiments of an eclectic kind) for the large public" ("C," 53). She dares to celebrate the emotional quality of melodrama: "Emotions varied and evanescent as clouds pass across the two women's faces; then for a moment the social bar is lowered while decency and generosity recognise each other . . . There is something rare and lovely in the film at this moment. Some people may not be moved to tears by it; most will be swept away on a tide of emotion. And while it stirs the feelings, this film also satisfies the mind pretty well" ("C," 53). As if to compensate for her emotional enthusiasm, the essay then moves to reassure readers that film is not only for the feelings: "But, that our emotions may not only be excited, the cinema is to bring us soon for repose a new and soothing picture&#x02014;<i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> in fact, acted under the supervision of Strauss himself, who has rearranged his honeyed and witty music to bear along the translated opera" ("C," 53). In a further attempt to raise the cultural status of cinema in England, Barry urges her readers to learn from the status of film abroad: "It is noteworthy, by the way, that on the Continent the cinema is held in more repute than in England; stage celebrities are glad to give their best work to even a quite tiny part in a film, artists design scenery for the studios, and musicians of world renown hasten to compose movie music. Is it not time that the conservative Briton ceased to pretend a contempt for this new and lively art? Or (seeing that he

patronises it so freely) does he perhaps only seem to belittle the cinema in order to creep into its entertaining bosom with the more satisfaction?" ("C," 53). After this stinging rebuke, she ends with praise for Chaplin again, citing the purest genius of humor in <i>The Gold Rush</i> ("C," 53).

Barry's essays draw attention to an undercurrent of tension between popular and experimental films apparent in various film essays and illustrations in <i>Vogue</i>.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Her position argues for balance between popular film and the avant-garde. That stance is visually enacted by the illustrations for this article: a full page studio shot of Charlie Chaplin faces her essay and three avant-garde caricatures of Chaplin by the painter and experimental filmmaker, Fernand L&#x000E9;ger, are interspersed within her columns (see <a href="#4"> 4</a>). <i>Vogue</i>'s tug of war between avant-garde elite cinema and popular movies hints at the familiar question of whether the popular can be art. For Iris Barry, the answer was emphatically "yes." In her <i>Vogue</i> essays she encourages spectators to welcome the experiments of the avant-garde abstract films, but to celebrate even more the intelligent <i>and</i> popular mainstream films such experiments make possible.

<p class="noIndent">
Along with her entries in <i>Vogue</i> and the <i>Spectator</i> in 1926, Iris Barry began a four year stint as a popular columnist in a quite different venue: the <i>Daily Mail.</i> As entries in a mass-market daily, Barry's <i>Daily Mail</i> columns are quite different in form, tone, and focus from the articles in the <i>Adelphi,</i> the <i>Spectator,</i> and <i>Vogue</i>; they demonstrate her versatility. The columns are splashier; sporting a big title and a byline "By IRIS BARRY" in capital letters, they are accompanied by pictures, often of stars or directors. The topics shift in the <i>Daily Mail</i> columns, placing more emphasis on Hollywood and on the trade in general. These columns include more discussion of stars and directors, and less of art and international experimental cinema. Celebrity profiles and behind-the-scenes industry information enter in (especially later in 1927 when Barry travels to Hollywood for a series of columns there). Many of the columns encourage British film, focusing on British directors and the film industry. Such columns coach British filmmakers&#x02014;and spectators&#x02014;about what "we" do and do not want, the direction film production in England should be taking, and the way to make good British films. The <i>Daily Mail</i> columns range between 300 and 500 words; clearly, they are columns rather than articles. The brief pieces are composed of short paragraphs of two to four sentences each, rather than the fully developed paragraphs and longer essays of the <i>Spectator</i> articles. The tone shifts dramatically in these columns; if the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Vogue</i> articles set up a rhetorical dance through which the reader and the writer move together, the <i>Daily Mail</i> pieces are shorter and to the point. Barry's tone is more chatty, almost breezy, and rather telegraphic or journalistic in style. One has the sense, reading these short pieces, that she has edited discursive pieces down to the bare bones&#x02014;or that they are notes for a longer article, jotted down in passing. The <i>Daily Mail</i> pieces fire off a few ideas and judgments, rather than inviting conversation and reflection. "The Lesson of Fairbanks," for instance, reads like the <i>Cliff Notes</i> of 

<b></b>

one of her longer discursive essays about film failings and potential. This new style suits the paper, though readers familiar with Barry might miss her well-developed essay style from earlier articles. As befits the newspaper format, her diction in the <i>Daily Mail</i> columns is more conversational, and she uses more popular slang. Though in all her writing, Barry could be rather blunt in her assessments, she uses terms such as "stupidity" or "idiotic" more often in the <i>Daily Mail</i> than, for example, in her <i>Vogue</i> pieces, which she sprinkles instead with French phrases. She knew her readers.

<p class="noIndent">
Barry's education in film came through her experiences as an engaged, intelligent spectator, as one of the founders of the Film Society, and as a reporter, investigating film in England and in Hollywood. There were no Oxbridge studies in cinema. To be a woman, not one of the Oxbridge elite, and a "cinema enthusiast" to boot, marked Iris Barry as a triple outsider of the intellectual aristocracy that still retained such presence in the culture industry of the 1920s. Daring to be a film critic in the early 1920s was to be rather declass&#x000E9;, unless one were, like Clive Bell, a Cambridge educated art critic, penning elitist articles about film (about which he knew little and liked less). Barry turned the outsider position, to a degree, to her advantage, claiming her film-going experience and celebrating, rather than apologizing for, cinema. Her film criticism brought to bear upon cinema a wide experience and a keen intelligence. She saw many films, thought about them with genuine curiosity and appreciation, and registered their impact on her questing intellect and emotions. Her vast screening experience enabled her to place any film in a context, to draw inferences from the specific and to see experiments as part of the overall dynamic of cinematic development. Her criticism is characterized by an open-minded curiosity. As she stated often, she found something of merit in all films and in all areas of film culture. She defined herself "as a pleasure-loving member of the public" who went to films all the time and liked much of what she saw&#x02014;and then she used that position to lecture to the film producers about what the public wants and does not want ("AP," 51). Paying attention to the screening environment, the spectator, the social context of the screening experience, the production side of film-making, the writing of film scripts, and the situation for actors, she found no arena of the film experience outside her scope and interest. As a cinema enthusiast, she worked to make her enthusiasm contagious. In her essays, she cajoles, flatters, browbeats, and begs readers to become active and ardent viewers too. She demands that audiences play the active role of consumer-advocates, urges potential writers to pen scenarios, encourages directors to experiment and to learn their craft through her timely advice, and professes, through it all, her admiration of film, her respect for the medium and its spectators, and her faith in its future. 

<b></b>

<p>
She wrote for the people; her critical voice speaks for the intelligent, "reflective" public, not for the elite, and, not for the "sheep," those members of the public she found not capable of discriminating. By taking film seriously and considering it with intelligent analysis and appreciation, she earned the respect and attention of her readers, who were drawn into her confidence and shared her perspective. Writing in a broadly accessible style, addressing the public as "we" rather than disdainfully as "they," she forged a coalition with a vast audience. Her experiential education in film viewing made it possible for her situate herself as a "common viewer" akin to Virginia Woolf's "common reader." Because her education in cinema was based on experience and a keen intelligence open to the material before her, her film criticism implies that her readers&#x02014;whatever their level of education&#x02014;could attain the same education by attending the films and using their intellects to examine them. Cinema is a democratic art, she claims, and she recommends a democratic, rather than an elitist, education and criticism to suit it.

Just as she celebrated cinema as a democratic art, Barry chose to write her criticism in a variety of tones that welcomed the democratic public in all its diversity, striking up conversations with a range of readers. Of Barry's style in writing and in conversation, a colleague from MoMA recalls, "She wrote with the enviable ease of the educated British, and her conversation flowed naturally, putting everyone at ease."<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  Barry's writing ranges from academic prose articulating highbrow aesthetic theory to breezy slang expressing the delight of a film fan. Her inclusive style and chameleon tone are her most apparent characteristics as a critic. She has the ability to do "the critic in different voices," somewhat akin to the range of voices in T. S. Eliot's <i>The Wasteland,</i> and she chooses, and uses, whichever voice she needs to make her point. Ranging from high style, to middle style, to the vernacular, sample passages demonstrate her scope:

though the moving picture has affinities with the respectable muses, it is a substitute for none of them, but one of the phenomena for which our age will be remembered: a new art born painfully and ingloriously, as no doubt the other arts too were born in unremembered days&#x02014;a new art more than we realize, for though it tells a story it is not a literary form; though it is a pictorial medium it is also a dramatic one; yet its concerns are not those of the theatre and its problems the very opposite of those that confront painters.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>

Barry's range of voices suggests that she selected the voice to best address an intended audience and to put forth her agenda for film. As a truly "public" public intellectual, committed to communicating with all, Barry was profoundly inclusive. Because she was passionately interested in making a difference in every area of film, from the industry to aesthetics, she deployed her criticism on multiple fronts, sometimes addressing the highbrow and sometimes the film fan. She wooed the upper crust in <i>Vogue</i> and the Film Society; she reached out to the bohemian <i>literati</i> in the <i>Adelphi</i> and to the intelligent citizen in the <i>Spectator;</i> she spoke to the broader public in the <i>Daily Mail;</i> she even trekked to Hollywood to engage with industry res there. And, she pulled all this together in her 1926 book, appropriately entitled, <i>Let's Go to the Pictures,</i> a book that bonds the reader and writer together into an active unit with the goal of going to see films together. 
</p>

<p>
Reviews of Barry's book shed light on the class and gender dynamics and biases of the cultural moment of the 1920s. Her choice of voice confused some reviewers, who missed the point. With characteristic elitism, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> delivered a critique drenched in class snobbery. First, it offers slight praise: "Miss Barry has a genuine, not a patronizing, interest in her subject, and a wealth of experience as a film-goer," but the essay then proceeds to patronize her: "Unhappily she is so determined that no 'film-fans,' however slight their powers of concentration, shall find her tedious that she is no sooner face to face with the aesthetic problems that the films suggest than she hurries away from them to bright, discursive chapters on 'stars,' producers and directors which are little more than a series of notes" ("F," 904). It accuses her of raising questions "in passing to impress the 'hicks' without troubling them" rather than examining them more in depth, fulfilling "the duty of a critic who escapes from a newspaper into a library" ("F," 904). The review articulates upper-class disdain: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Meanwhile we learn that "I love Jackie Coogan but I don't call him a big actor," that "my favourite female star is Lil Dagover"; that "Rudolph Valentino had a talent," or that a film called <i>Greed</i> was "so terribly moving that it upset one as much as sitting through three Greek tragedies to see it." She says, too, that all the regular film-goers she knows, including herself, enjoy whatever they see. It is useful thus to be reminded that there are people in the world more fortunate than ourselves; but the reminder is no substitute for that discerning criticism of film theory which Miss Barry approaches but does not pursue.

Robert Herring continues the vein of Oxbridge elitism in his review in the <i>London Mercury.</i><sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  Faint praise describes Barry's style: "Miss Barry writes brightly," but Herring then faults her content: "she does little else but arrange an average intelligent person's ideas in print." He credits her experience: "Miss Barry has, as readers of the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Daily Mail</i> know, enormous experience; she believes in her subject and she remembers, despite their thousands, the films she has seen," and her willingness to express opinions: "She knows her mind and makes no bones in expressing it" ("P," 314). However, he is dismissive about her ability to make decisions about audience and voice: "She should make up her mind as to which public she is writing for and not, 

<b></b>

in trying to place her experience at the service of too many, fall foul of the vulgar without touching the highbrows" ("P," 314). His assumption that she could not make up her mind, and failure to recognize that she had made a choice not to write as the Oxbridge elite, are surely shaped by class and gender. The gendered spin and snobbery of that response is writ large in one sneering passage, "The fault of the book lies in phrases such as 'Films, like press-fasteners and garter-elastic, fulfill a long-felt want,' (although she sincerely considers the film as an art). This at first disturbed me, until I found that she described highbrows as people who read Masefield and <i>The Constant Nymph;</i> then all was clear" ("P," 314). The last line of his review completes the damning with faint praise: "There are many interesting photographs in this vivacious book, and the publishers are to be congratulated on the binding" ("P," 314). Against the backdrop of such hostility and sheer bewilderment&#x02014;inflected by male and class privilege&#x02014;the radical inclusiveness of Barry's writing stands out as a courageous choice. Paraphrasing her own comments about the cinema, we might claim, "Iris Barry is a critic for the people. To my mind, that is a merit."

Barry's belief that the best films were "at once popular and different" sheds light on her criteria for the best criticism. It reminds us that, for Barry, the bottom line was to "do the most good" for film as a medium. Barry hoped to accomplish that through critical writing that is both original and popular, in order to reach the public "in greater numbers than ever." This was an active agenda, not an abstract one. As her autobiographical sketch tells us, she was one impervious to "fear or favour," who "got out pencils and paper at once to sketch a program of action." As Sidney Bernstein and Ivor Montagu record, "in committee her commonsense cut through waffling to decision and action."<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  Whether the project was setting up a Film Society, brainstorming about ways to invigorate the British film industry, finding ways to educate the public about film, or educating the film industry about the public, Barry was ardent, active, and productive.

Because Iris Barry found film "one of the phenomena for which our age will be remembered," she put her gifts in the service of that phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Her writing, and her work as a public intellectual (founding the Film Society, founding the Museum of Modern Art Film Library) came from that passion. Not everyone agreed with Barry and her inclusive agenda. But, as we take in the broader sweep of film culture in the twentieth century, her legacy is unmistakable. Her descendents include all of us&#x02014;all who teach film, all who write about it, all who have screened it. When she left the London scene, she did not disappear; she came to New York to found the film library and archive at the Museum of Modern Art, and continued her prolific and astonishing career of bringing film to the public.

On 15 January 1886, in a flat rented by Eleanor Marx and her common law husband, Edward Aveling, a group of socialist friends and acquaintances took the advice of Olive Schriener and performed a staged reading of Henrik Ibsen's <i>Nora</i> (later titled <i>A Doll's House</i>) in the early translation by Henrietta Francis Lord. Marx took the part of the heroine, Nora Helmer; Aveling read the lines of Nora's hypocritical husband, Torvald; G. B. Shaw played the blackmailing Nils Krogstad; and May Morris, daughter of William Morris, spoke the lines of Christine Linde, Nora's older, and sadder, childhood friend. By all reports, the reading was a success, though Shaw later recollected that, at the time, he knew little about Ibsen. Within five years, the Norwegian playwright would emerge as a hero of the avant-garde London theatre. For the next twenty years, Ibsen's plays appeared in many modernists' libraries and they were debated by artists and intellectuals throughout Europe.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The 1886 gathering of like-minded socialists was one of many staged within artistic circles, who used a variety of performance events as occasions for social exchange, political polemic, and aesthetic experiment.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Theatrical and paratheatrical entertainments like the Ibsen readings, while often dismissed as trivial, hint at the central role played by theatrical forms of discourse in the practice of modernist sociability.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
One of the unique qualities of this sociability&#x02014;its affinity for argument and debate&#x02014;was described five years later by Edith Less Ellis, following the premier of Ibsen's newly translated <i>Doll's House</i>:
</p>

<b></b>. . . Emma Brooke . . . and Eleanor Marx. We were restive and almost savage in our arguments. What did it mean? Was it life or death for women? . . . Was it joy or sorrow for men?

Dramas, dialogues, debates, and recitations were ubiquitous as vehicles for social exchange in the London of 1880-1914, when, together with daily newspapers, theatre had become firmly established as the mass media.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Not only did staged entertainments play before millions of spectators annually but also paratheatrical events&#x02014;staged readings, lectures, charades, and ju-jitsu demonstrations, for example&#x02014;became standard features at private parties, club meetings, religious gatherings, political rallies, and "at-homes." For the London avant-garde, theatrical performance and its variants provided a familiar and flexible form for displaying the very social life they meant to interrogate. During dramatic readings arranged among friends, for example, speakers could magnify and observe social agency through the process of comparing their lives to those of their fictional characters. When the Social Democratic Federation held an "Art Evening" fund raiser on 21 November 1884, Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling gave a reading of Sydney Grundy's play, <i>In Honour Bound.</i> One spectator noted that the play "related their story;" that is, the play invited the spectator to compare the story it told to the personal story of Eleanor and Edward's unconventionally modern live-in arrangement.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In other social exchanges, such as meetings of the Men and Women's Club and the Fabian Society in the mid-1880s, or the Actresses' Franchise League (1908-17), members would stage debates on the merits of "free love," socialism, and votes for women, using the performed nature of these exchanges to purchase self-scrutiny, social validity, and political advocacy.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In one of their most striking features, some of these events used a public or semi-public forum to debate private content, while others used private or semi-private venues to debate public policy&#x02014;matters such as sexual conduct, deemed intensely intimate, were discussed side-by-side with the merits of socialism. This deliberate crossing of intimacy with publicness&#x02014;in a range of locations from drawing rooms to licensed theatres&#x02014;gave modernist sociability its distinctively edgy quality. 
</p>

<p>
Particular meanings of "public" and "private" have been implicated centrally in the history of events that constitute "sociability," a concept famously used by Philippe Ari&#x000E8;s to refer&#x02014;somewhat nostalgically&#x02014;to the social organization of the old (pre-modern) regime.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In this regime, wrote Ari&#x000E8;s, "the movement of collective life carried along in a single torrent all ages and classes, leaving nobody any time for privacy. In these crowded, collective existences there was no room for a private sector. The family fulfilled a function; it ensured the transmission of life, property and names; but it did not penetrate very far into human sensibility" (<i>CC,</i> 411). For Ari&#x000E8;s, sociability refers to a pre-eighteenth century form of social life in which all members of a community, regardless of age or class, mixed and mingled in collective households and outdoor markets, fields, churches, and public greens. With the eighteenth century rebirth of education, childhood was invented and children became segregated from adults. Gradually, the modern family emerged, which "advanced in proportion as sociability . . . 

<b></b>

retreated" (<i>CC,</i> 406). "One is tempted to conclude," he wrote, "that sociability and the concept of the family were incompatible, and could develop only at each other's expense" (<i>CC,</i> 407). In Ari&#x000E8;s's use of the concept, then, sociability refers to a set of conventions by which a polymorphous public realm of great diversity permitted people of various ages, classes, skill levels, and wealth to coexist and interact in their differences. These conventions did not recognize the practice of privacy&#x02014;and its offshoot, the family. In historical writing after Ari&#x000E8;s, "sociability" has been decoupled from its normative association with the pre-modern sense of "public" and is used instead to describe various modern forms of voluntary association, filiation, and exchange that cross the public (governmental-economic) and private (domestic-family) divide.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
In a lucid survey of the public/private distinction as it has developed in western culture since Ari&#x000E8;s, Jeff Weintraub notes that "the contrast between the 'personal,' emotionally intense, and intimate domain of family, friendship, and the primary group and the impersonal, severely instrumental domain of the market and formal institutions is . . . experienced . . . as one of the great divides of modern life. But historically these two poles emerge together . . . in dialectical tension with each other."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
In a further refinement of these linked categories, Tracy Davis and Ellen Donkin's recent study of women's playwriting in nineteenth-century England assumes a sociability that operates on a continuum within both the public and the private spheres of activity. In this model, socializing and art making both emerged in an "associative public sphere" conditioned by the coupling of the private and public through the eighteenth-century ideologies of sentimentality (dominating the private sphere) and capitalism (dominating the public).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The sociability I hope to make intelligible through a viewing of Ibsenite drama of the London avant-garde offered its participants occasions for critically evaluating the associative public sphere. Women artists, in particular, poised between the private realm of domesticity and sentimentality and the public realm of professionalism, used theatrical and paratheatrical forms to display and critique changing expectations for women's lives. For, of all the social "questions" occupying the day, the woman question, with its implications for marriage, childbearing, sexuality, labor, citizenship, nationhood, and selfhood, proved to be one of the most tenacious, with implications so various and disturbing that some observers registered a degree of panic that modern womanhood was threatening the future of the race.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
The particular case of <i>Alan's Wife</i> , a short play in three scenes with a brief but tangled history, authored in a secret collaboration between Florence Bell and Elizabeth Robins, offers a telling example of how the avant-garde theatre provided a staging ground for displaying and shaping modernist sociability. The play's fable scrutinizes "the great divide" between the intimate sphere of family and motherhood and the public sphere of law and commerce, while the historical circumstances of the play's genesis and production pull into focus more subtle and complex modes of sociability through which historical women theatre artists negotiated their personal lives and public associations.

Alan's Wife</i> &#x02014;the Fable and Its Performance
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
<i>Alan's Wife</i> began as a story, "Befraid," published in a Swedish magazine by Elin Ameen, a younger contemporary of Ibsen's. Following the 1890 appearance of Ibsen on the London stage, the <i>literati</i> had begun to watch for Scandinavian writers, and soon after its publication in Swedish, a summary of the story appeared in W. T. Stead's <i>Review of Reviews</i> for February 1891: "<i>Ur Dagens Kr&#x000F6;nika</i> contains a terrible and powerfully written story&#x02014;physiological and psychological" the summary begins.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  A <i>pr&#x000E9;cis</i> follows, describing the middle-class heroine, Emma, as a gifted and spirited schoolmaster's daughter. Emma marries a factory workman, Hans, attracted to his strength and joy in life. While waiting at their simple cottage for his return home, she learns that Hans has stayed behind to put right a new machine. Eventually four men bring to her door the covered, mangled body of her dead husband. She falls to the ground in a faint. Seven months later, their child is born, but instead of appearing strong and lusty, in the image of Hans, the baby is missing one arm and both legs. Emma broods over plans to protect the child, but fears for its future after she is gone. After baptizing the infant, she does what God will not do by smothering it. Later she is discovered in prison, where she will remain for one to three years, according to Swedish law, unwilling to repent her crime, but taking comfort in the knowledge that she freed her child. 
</p>

<p>
This sketch would have held great appeal for a literate public fascinated by the subjects of marriage and heredity as suggested by the following titles from 1891 issues of <i>Review of Reviews</i>: "Is Habit Hereditary?" "How to Improve the Race. Marry from the Point of View of Offspring," and "'Darwinism in the Nursery.' Curious Experiments with Babies." The story soon drew the attention of French and Russian translators, and Ameen herself wrote a Swedish dramatic adaptation, <i>En Moder,</i> which she sent to Robins with whom she had been corresponding since the appearance of <i>Alan's Wife.</i><sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Robins's and Bell's revisions to Ameen's fable and to Archer's scenario speak to their interest in displaying the dilemma of modern motherhood, the post-Rousseau "regime of total attention to the child from an early age."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Ameen's story and its reworking represent the modern mother as a revisioning of Ibsen's Mrs. Alving, the mother confronted at the conclusion of <i>Ghosts</i> with a choice between euthanizing her son or permitting him to live with severe dementia. Modern motherhood's "regime of total attention" coincides with the emergence of heredity as a determining force in the individual's destiny. Not only must the mother assume total responsibility for her child's well being but she must do so knowing that she cannot control the child's future. She is both compelled and prevented from fulfilling the responsibility of her modern mandate. 
</p>

<p>
The play's shift in setting from Sweden to the north of England was probably the work of Robins's collaborator and closest friend, Florence Bell, a prolific writer of plays, fiction, and biography and a practiced translator of French, Swedish, and German, among other languages. Bell's experience as the wife of Sir Hugh Bell, a north

Yorkshire ironmaster, included visiting the homes of over 200 laboring families, performing various works of charity, and recording details of the families' lives. Bell's observations of the townspeople, especially its women, published in 1907 under the title <i>At the Works,</i> modified the Victorian genre of (typically middle-class) eye-witness accounts of the working class made famous by Charles Booth's 1886-1903 study of poverty by accounting for the particular conditions of women's lives.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In removing the location of <i>Alan's Wife</i> from urban London with its growing domestic culture of consumption, Bell and Robins style the environment in which their heroine confronts and makes her maternal choice as both unfamiliar and attractive.
</p>

<p>
Bell and Robins made other changes as well, introducing the young anemic parson and Jean's rejected suitor, Jamie Warren, as a substitute for Archer's older doctor. Scene 2 closely resembles the Ameen story<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  in debating the correct Christian attitude towards the baby's disability, in which Jean resists and Jamie defends stoic acceptance of the child's suffering. But the Bell/Robins's Jean does not, like Archer's, run to her mother in panic following the infanticide; rather, she approaches the cradle clutching a blanket "<i>with a long wailing cry.</i>" The mother's solitary act, not others' responses to it, brings down the curtain. Scene 3 of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> set in the prison to which Jean has been sent, underscores her legal and ethical isolation as she refuses to plead guilty by reason of post-partum depression, or to repent, concluding that she "must" be punished according to the law.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  More radically than Ameen's Emma, therefore, who, according to Swedish custom, faces up to three years in prison for suffocating her child, and whose imprisonment evokes pathos rather than fear, Bell and Robins's Jean embraces her punishment as both necessary and oppositional, resorting to silence as her absolute refusal of the public rule of law.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In their rewriting of Ameen's story and Archer's scenario, Bell and Robins foreground the modern mother through their rendering of Jean's character, the causes leading to the infanticide, and the play's tragic conclusion, which demonstrates the greatest variance from their sources. Jean's and Alan's identity as passionate, sturdy, and generically "northern" people, drawn to one another's health and vitality, exempts them from the scourge of middle-class conformity that has implicitly weakened others like Jamie Warren, the timid curate Jean's mother wishes she had married.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  While based on Bell's direct experience, the northern setting and dialogue created a critical distance from London culture while exploiting the London vogue for regional picturesque, including details of outdoor dining, Yorkshire names, and dialect.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Jean's and Alan's physical, intellectual, and instinctual confidence (qualities they shared with the self-identified Ibsenite avant-garde) become established narratively and visually through an ironic counterpoint to the ordinary townspeople who reluctantly admire their fitness. Alan has stayed behind in the mill to "master" the new saw, which other workers dismiss as "newfangled," while Jean pours her energy into cooking his lunch and cleaning their cottage.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Jean, says Mrs. Holroyd, "was always . . . a strange girl," "I never saw such a lass for fresh air! And Alan is just as bad."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Jean's and Alan's "strangeness" divides them from the audience of sophisticated Londoners and from the more ordinary members of their fictional northern community.

</p>

<p>
This same Jean, however, falls down in a conventional melodramatic faint, upon viewing her husband's body mangled by a new piece of machinery. The baby she eventually bears carries Alan's name, and his crippled body replicates the spectacle of his father on the stretcher. Thus, the child's repetition of his father's trauma appears to accord with a centuries-old belief in the impressibility of the fetus.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  That belief appears in this play as the modern trope of heredity, echoing its appearance in Henrik Ibsen's <i>Ghosts, A Doll House,</i> and <i>Hedda Gabler,</i> where it emerges as a powerful agent of repetition hidden in the subject's mind and body. Ibsen's representations of heredity appealed to Elizabeth Robins, whose interpretation of her own life as "cursed" drove her to avoid marriage, sexuality, and childbearing. In a submerged biographical corollary to the fictional Jean, Elizabeth Robins had been warned by her grandmother 10 years earlier not to tempt fate by marrying and bearing children. Robins's mother, Hannah Maria, had undergone severe post-partum depression following the birth of her seventh child when Elizabeth was 10 years old. She spent most of the rest of her life in mental institutions. A letter written to Elizabeth by the paternal grandmother who raised her, Jane Hussey Robins, advised her, "I . . . have written this to you . . . as a <i>warning</i>&#x02014;Sh! It is a thing of heredity&#x02014;Do not, I beseech you, my darling child, rush into matrimony which may plunge you into a sea of difficulty where you may sink to rise no more!"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Current medical research supported her grandmother's suspicion: "It has always been recognized that . . . heredity plays a very considerable part in mental diseases," wrote Professor E. Mendel, author of the 1908 essay, "Insanity in Relation to Marriage."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  But the role played by heredity in diseases of the mind was mysteriously more significant for women than it was for men: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
(W)hereas under ordinary circumstances crossed heredity is the rule&#x02014;that is, the daughter resembles the father and the son the mother&#x02014;in hereditary insanity the influence of the mother shows itself principally in the daughter, and that of the father in the son. . . . Altogether the maternal influence in the transmission of the hereditary predisposition (to mental illness) is greater than the paternal."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In spite of her grandmother's discouragement, Elizabeth did marry two years later a mentally unstable actor who committed suicide following two years of struggles over finances, illness, and Elizabeth's promising career. As the daughter of a mentally unstable mother and the wife of a mentally unstable man, Robins's hypothesized abortion, speculated to have occurred at some point during her courtship, or in the two years of her marriage, along with her subsequent lifelong refusal to remarry, would seem to be rooted in her sense of biological fate, a sense informing the mimesis of disrement in Alan the son.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This sense becomes fully expressed five years later in her pseudonymous work of fiction, <i>The Open Question,</i> which interrogates the ethics of bearing children in families afflicted with hereditary disease&#x02014;here disguised as consumption<b>.</b> In the Bell-Robins tragedy of motherhood, fate is red metonymically as heredity rather than God's will. The modern heroic mother does not simply accept but anticipates heredity, and she acts to minimize the suffering it will inflict on the 

<b></b>

innocent. In this respect, <i>Alan's Wife</i> shares common ground not with Medea, who kills her children for revenge, but with slave mother Margaret Garner<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  and other historical and fictional mothers who, while granting their children full subjectivity, wish for or perform their early and merciful deaths to spare them inevitable suffering.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Jean reacts to her crippled baby with a realist performance of puerperal insanity.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  When a neighbor asks her, "What's a mother for, if it's not to care for the bairn that needs it most," Jean, "sitting listlessly" in front of the fire, answers, "I suppose so! That is what's left&#x02014;there'll be nothing else in my life" (<i>AW,</i> 26). But once she is briefly alone on stage, she forcefully declares her love for the baby and, in a following dialogue with visiting Jamie Warren, plots an ethical strategy to set him free.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In this abrupt shift from the listless melancholia of grief to the coherent resolve of tragic action, the character Jean (in what must have been a virtuosic acting opportunity) takes up the part of the modern mother with militant determination. Not only will she drop all concern for her own future but she will sacrifice her life to ensure that the child will be spared a lifetime of physical pain and humiliation. Under the pressure of Warren's religious platitudes, and in a following monologue preparatory to suffocating the baby, Jean reveals her sense of obligation to the child, masked earlier in the scene by her attitude of depressed indifference. Addressing the cradle, she tells the baby, "I seem to see you in some far-off time, your face distorted like your body, . . . saying, 'Mother, how <i>could</i> you be so cruel as to let me live and suffer? You could have saved me this long martyrdom. . . . You were a coward!" (<i>AW,</i> 36). Twenty-three years later, Angelina Weld Grimk&#x000E9; would write <i>Rachel,</i> an anti-lynching play in which another activist young woman in another melodramatic monologue followed by an onstage faint, abandons her plans to marry and bring children into the murderously racist USA.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  During this period of heightened gender and racial awareness, women playwrights used the re of the tragic modern mother to underscore the contradictions underlying her exercise of maternal responsibility. 
</p>

<p>
In Robins's and Bell's rewriting of the story, Jean's character looks forward to the twentieth century and backward to the nineteenth. She both complies with and resists patriarchy, embracing Alan as her "master" while rejecting Christian commands to subsume her will to God's. But her decision to smother the baby positions her as a "high modernist" mother, anticipating the discourses of Freud, Darwin, and Marx. She attributes to the child a future complete with a fully developed subjectivity for which she alone is responsible ("Mother, how could you be so cruel?"); she perceives him as one of the unfit, with a physically disadvantaged relation to the environment; and she projects onto him an economic vulnerability growing from his radical dependence in an industrial setting where the best workers die first in the contest with machines.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  As a dramatic type, the Bell/Robins Jean ingeniously combines realist detail with stock qualities of the New Woman, appealing both to middle-class Londoners' curiosity about the northern, laboring-class other, and simultaneously representing that other in terms familiar to Independent Theatre audiences acquainted with the New Woman character and anticipating her politicized sister in the suffragette.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The modern mother speaks through Jean's conflating of heredity with fate, and through her performance of the play's tragic conclusion. The Jean we have come to "know" by the end of Scene 2 appears complex and partially hidden, speaking a fraction of what she "thinks." When alone on stage, following the convention of the soliloquy, her "true" inner thoughts and feelings rush to the surface; but when onstage with others&#x02014;her mother, Jamie Warren, or a judge&#x02014;she speaks little, or, if she does speak candidly, it's usually in opposition to those around her. In this way, Bell and Robins contrive, before the final scene, to bring the spectator and reader into intimacy with a maternal character whose burgeoning subjectivity beckons them to discover it hiding within her.
</p>

<p>
Scene 3 opens on a room in the prison where Jean is being held. Officials, the presiding Colonel is told, "Can get nothing out of her" (<i>AW,</i> 38). Mrs. Holroyd appears before the Colonel to plead for Jean's life, but her speech betrays her. Instead of securing her daughter's freedom, she reports that Jean murdered her child in retribution for his disability. Jean, with whom the audience is on increasingly intimate terms, stands before her frightened mother and representatives of the law, having quit speech entirely as a function of her now complete and irreversible isolation&#x02014;the price of selfhood for her and her dead infant. The split view of Jean offered in this scene&#x02014;the external view of her as vengeful, murderous mother versus her self view (shared by a hypothetical audience/readership) as the ultimate maternal sacrificer&#x02014;draws both on the earlier conventions of melodrama, with its faints and gestic silences attributing emotional agency to female characters, and to emerging Expressionist drama, concerned to represent potentially threatening subconscious, nonlinguistic states. Jean's invoking of silence in the face of her accusers&#x02014;a silence glossed by her inner thoughts in the published text&#x02014;both revises the abject silence of the nineteenth-century melodramatic heroine and anticipates the expressive silence of twentieth-century drama. Susan Glaspell's silent, homicidal wife in <i>Trifles</i>  and Sophie Treadwell's "unspoken appeal" to the female audience of <i>Machinal</i> show how silence can function in modern theatre within a realist and expressionist aesthetic.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Jean's silence asserts her isolation, her expanding subjectivity already hinted at in the "wail" accompanying the smothering of her child. Confronted with two maimings, Jean undergoes a double shock that appears first as depression but gives way subtextually in the expressionistically segmented third scene to ethical certainty. Jean becomes a subject-mother and, as such, refuses language and culture in favor of taking back what she produced. As a modern mother, she claims ownership of a child otherwise believed to be a subject of the church, the community, and the nation. This "modern" silence refuses history and culture in the service of what recent theorists would call the Imaginary&#x02014;that hypothetical condition without difference and absence where only identity and presence exist.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In her farewell to her mother, Jean tentatively uses Christian terms to explain her commitment to a utopian Imaginary, " Maybe I shall find him up yonder made straight and fair and happy . . . in Alan's arms" (<i>AW,</i> 48). Jean's hubris is to hold up the Imaginary as a dream worth dying for. Within ten years, a variation of this dream using a slogan fitted to Jean's resolve&#x02014;"Deeds not words!"&#x02014;would infuse the suffrage movement

with a determination to embed women in the nation's future. Two photographs from the suffrage era help to demonstrate how the social history of women and mothers changed from 1893 to 1914. <a href="#1">re 1</a> shows an imprisoned suffragette, physically isolated like Jean, but aware of the nearby presence of fellow prisoners. <a href="#2">re 2</a> shows how some suffrage mothers included their children in photographs, iconographically declaring them members of the enfranchised future. 
</p>

<p>
Gesturally melodramatic and subtextually modern, the fable of <i>Alan's Wife</i> and its performance looks back at the pathos of Dion Boucicault's plays and forward past Ibsen's, framing the mother as a new subject who both recognizes her child as <i>other</i> (determined by the past or heredity) and as <i>same</i> (a subject who thinks and feels as she does). This was the new challenge to motherhood imposed by the exigencies of heredity. Jean's "heroic" response, represented in the play as a misunderstood rejection of deformity, reconciles post-Enlightenment "maternal devotion" with new understandings of the infant's nature as neither entirely other than nor fully identical with the mother's "self".

<p class="noIndent">
As it was revised by Robins and Bell, the play's fable simplified and stylized the representation of family relations and their collision with the legal and economic systems of law and industrial labor. The actual historical circumstances of the play's production and printing, however, involved more subtle and complex modes of sociability through which the collaborators negotiated their private lives and public associations while anonymously producing the controversial drama. <i>Alan's Wife</i> appeared in the second season of J. T. Grein's Independent Theatre Society (1891-1898), one of the avant-garde societies that hoped to revitalize British theatre in the twentieth century. Begun as a provocative venture with an unlicensed<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  1891 production of Ibsen's <i>Ghosts,</i> the Society fashioned itself after Andr&#x000E9; Antoine's Th&#x000E9;&#x000E2;tre Libre, or "Free Theatre," whose "freedom" arose from rejecting not only the aesthetics but also the funding mechanisms and managerial styles of commercial theatres.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  As self-styled alternatives to commercial theatre, societies like the Independent not only represented controversial fictions on stage but also structured and managed themselves in opposition to official, licensed theatres. Microcosmic and typically short-lived experiments, they refashioned theatrical production through brief, new alignments of the public and private realms, offering alternative economic arrangements (usually entailing a subscription system for ensuring ticket sales) and the public staging of heretofore "private" matters such as sexuality, family life, and gender relations. 
</p>

<p>
The Independent's second season began featuring the "young English writers" originally promised by its collective organizers, most notably the anonymous authors of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> a play set in the north of England with an English working-class woman as its center of interest. At this moment when the lives of women as vehicles of the "new" were the subject of intense debate, women playwrights made calculated choices to appear&#x02014;or not appear&#x02014;as the authors of their works.

But whatever their individual reasons for remaining anonymous, both would have known that anonymity could be productive, guaranteeing curiosity and the expectation of controversy.

and personal ties between William Archer and Elizabeth Robins. Archer claimed to have read the Ameen story in a Swedish magazine lent him by Robins. The actress, he claimed, read the story in a German translation, but thought it unsuited for drama. But Robins herself described reading a summary of Ameen's story in W. T. Stead's <i>Review of Reviews</i> and did see in it the makings of a play (<i>ER,</i> 89). In his Introduction to the published text of the play, Archer describes writing a rough three-scene scenario soon after reading the story, which he sent to Miss Robins with the names of "two young dramatists" who could turn it into a play. The two young dramatists were Robins and Bell, Archer having confidentially advised them and publicly colluded with their efforts to suppress their joint authorship. Whether it was Archer or Robins who 

<b></b>

set in motion the dramatizing of "Befraid," the play follows the major events described in the <i>pr&#x000E9;cis,</i> changing the national location, some of the characters, the characters' names, and, most importantly, the conclusion, to suit the requirements of a modern tragedy. 
</p>

<p>
By mid-September 1891, Bell and Robins had shown Archer a completed script. They had read Archer's scenario, and accepted some of his criticism of their drafts, but shared a conspiratorial understanding that they should beware of Archer's tendency to suppress their creative efforts. Bell told Robins in November of 1892 that she was sending her the (characters') "names suggested by WA [William Archer]," adding that they needn't show him the play's conclusion, as he won't like it, and "I'm afraid he wd quash it again!" Later, when readying the script for publication, Bell wrote Robins, "As to WA's Preface. . . . I dread it rather. . . . I somehow feel beforehand that I shant like WA very much or Grein either."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  When Archer's 43 page preface appeared in the 1893 published edition of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> both Bell and Robins found it overwhelming, as did Archer's friend G. B. Shaw, who disliked the play ("superstitious atheism"). He chastised his friend, whom he thought infatuated by Robins, in a letter, "The one fact that is clear about <i>Alan's Wife</i> is that you should have written it yourself" (Shaw to Archer 21 Aug. 1893, F).
</p>

<p>
As one of Archer's closest friends and an influential member of avant-garde artistic and socialist political circles, Shaw's opinion of Elizabeth Robins would have made a personal and professional difference to Archer&#x02014;and to Robins herself. Shaw apparently held her in high regard as an actress, but his sexual flirtation complicated their friendship. What Shaw biographer Michael Holroyd called Elizabeth's "prim intensity and devastating stage pathos" both drew Shaw's attention and frustrated his attraction.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  After Robins apparently threw him out of a carriage in response to his overtures, Shaw began calling her "Saint Elizabeth," and sent her letters praising her beauty and mischievously implying that he had enjoyed her sexual favors.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In the wrong hands, such letters represented a potential threat to the actress. Shaw's serio-comic punishment of Robins for rejecting him revealed another dimension of gendered sociability in the theatrical avant-garde. While he would be the first to condemn it, Shaw's joking letters exploited the sexual double standard by which their discovery would enhance his reputation as a philanderer and damage Robins's reputation as a serious professional. During these years, Shaw used gossip and unflattering accusations directed at Robins to advance his own love interest, Ibsen actress Janet Achurch, and to characterize Robins's influence over Archer as emasculating. Shaw resented her power over his good friend Archer and aggressively promoted Achurch over Robins where he could.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As a late Victorian actress, Robins's position in the London theatre world was uniquely capable of upward mobility and qualified respectability.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  But achieving mobility and respect required a balance between befriending men and becoming intimate with them. The widowed actress, like Robins, was precariously positioned within a field of mostly male professionals who could serve her interests or damage them at will. As Robins's career reveals, the ambitious actress and writer had to cultivate the friendship and admiration of male colleagues while preserving her independence and her reputation for integrity. She had to draw the sustained interest of male managers, 

<b></b>

critics, and spectators, but limit their intimacy. She had, in short, to develop Hedda Gabler's talent for handling a character like the predatory Judge Brack, a talent, Robins noted, few men understood: "How should men understand Hedda on the stage when they didn't understand her in the persons of their wives, their daughters, their women friends?"<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  G. B. Shaw was one of those men, about whom Robins wrote, "He couldn't be expected to understand the as yet, unusually Independent Woman. . . . He . . . never dreamed . . . what a lot of social history was bound up in woman's use of the handiest as well as the most quietly effectual means of warding off complications" (qtd. in <i>ER,</i> 62). 
</p>

<p>
The "social history" implicit in the production of <i>Alan's Wife</i> is a gendered history resembling one of Ibsen's realist plots, turning on secrets, private arrangements and withholdings; heterosexual love, same-sex friendships, small betrayals, and calculated shock, all performed in the wings of a modern theatrical movement making a claim to literary merit. One of the most closely guarded secrets giving rise to the play was Robins's love affair with the married William Archer, whom she met in June of 1890. By the early fall of 1891, their friendship had become intimate and by November of that year Robins wrote that WA was "coming to demand too much of me. . . . It wd. not be hard for me to love this man not wisely but too well."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  They remained secretly (but not necessarily sexually) intimate for a decade and later destroyed most of their personal correspondence. Archer's reading of the Swedish story saw in it a performing vehicle for his "dearest Bessie" that could, with the help of Bell's knowledge of Swedish, quickly become a translation/adaptation. His public sponsorship of the play, awkwardly announced in his excessive preface and underscored in his <i>Westminster Review</i> article, emerged in part, as Shaw recognized, from his involvement with Robins, one that blended the personal and the professional.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  As one of the foremost professional drama critics in London, Archer's opinion had influence, especially among promoters of the New Drama and Ibsen, but his friendships and alliances extended into all realms of professional theatre.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  He used these connections judiciously to help Robins, often giving her advice (which she often followed), especially on the matter of shaping her public image.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Later, when Robins turned to writing fiction more steadily, two of her male friends, both W. T. Stead and William Archer, regularly read her work. (<i>ER,</i> 105). 
</p>

<p>
While Robins and Bell labored to prepare the script, locate actors, and raise funds for the production of <i>Alan's Wife,</i><sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  J. T. Grein, the founder of the Independent Theatre, privately turned to his acquaintance, Mr. Pigott, the examiner of plays, to secure a license to perform it.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  As required of all licensed theatres from 1728 until 1968, a typescript of the play was submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's office for approval, but in this case, it was submitted after omitting (in possible collusion with Piggot) its controversial scene.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Purged of the infanticide scene, the Examiner of Plays passed <i>Alan's Wife,</i> permitting two performances of a drama written in part to defy his authority.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The sociability enabling this understanding relied on shared class codes (a "gentleman's agreement") overlapping with a shared view of Independent Theatre-goers as elite "knowing" sophisticates impervious to the "contaminating" potential of controversial 

<b></b>

plays. Not only the play's fable but also its production assumed the elite nature of the Independent Theatre enterprise. 
</p>

<p>
Women's forms of sociability, similarly&#x02014;but perhaps more loosely&#x02014;tied to class codes, could be more complex than men's, often including accommodations for husbands, managers, male protectors or authority res, and safeguards for their public image. For their part, Bell's and Robins's personal friendship bridged the distinct realms of Bell's country house set and Robins's theater colleagues,<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  but the repeated secrecy of their professional collaborations suggests that they both enjoyed, even while grappling with, gendered barriers to public visibility. One of Bell's reasons for avoiding public recognition as a professional writer (she discouraged a biography and suppressed her name on translations) was deference to her husband, who disliked her assuming the attitude of a professional. Referring archly to Sir Hugh Bell's wishes, she wrote Robins in 1895, "I must keep up the fiction that (this profession of mine) must be done in a trifling ladylike manner at odd moments or it will be taking it too seriously."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Robins, belonging in spirit to a younger generation of women, many of whom played by the same rules as men in writing for gain, adopted pseudonyms and anonymity for precisely the opposite reason&#x02014;to avoid paying a professional penalty. Having become known first in England as an actress, she anticipated critical dismissal of her fiction as the curious scribblings of a stage performer. For the sake of her work and its critical assessment, she felt she should distinguish her fiction-writing persona from her performing persona (<i>ER,</i> 106). She may have been following Archer's advice on this point, but she was ignoring publisher and close friend William Heinemann's urging to use her stage name to enhance the sales of her books. As a self-identified hybrid of actress-intellectual, she sought critical acclaim first; sales could follow, or not. Her financial vulnerability encouraged her greater involvement in fiction writing.
</p>

<p>
Both women operated within gendered limits&#x02014;for one of them the traditional limits of class and domestic duty, for the other limits of professional (male) perception and critical judgment. But in spite of their differences, they forged a common ground, eagerly seizing the chance to work quietly, comfortably, and productively with a trusted woman friend. "I grow more conscious of the calm beneficence of a timely word of cheer and affection from a <i>woman,</i>" Robins wrote Bell in February of 1892. As the exchange of letters between the two and biographies of Robins reveal, Florence Bell's intimate friendship provided Robins with the unqualified maternal love she had lacked as a girl, while Bell's husband and children served as a warm and loving family whose shelter she could seek when she needed rest and recuperation. For her part, Bell found in Robins a single woman artist living a life of urban intensity that she envied, tied as she was to a prestigious and public household with its continual demands upon her time and energy. 
</p>

<p>
Bell and Robins held a fierce commitment to the new mother as evidence of the New Woman who could write successfully in a full partnership with another woman. When Robins reported to Bell her reading of the script to actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree in the fall of 1892, Bell replied, "I can't help a chuckle when I hear that he approved of the writing of the piece, and when I think of his maintaining that 

<b></b>

women can't write. . . . the mere thought of ("Befraid") makes my heart leap and burn within me . . . I love you dearly, best of friends and collaborators. 'Women can't write,' did you say?" (FB to ER, Nov-Dec. 1892). In a gesture typical of her maternal generosity towards Robins, Bell urged her to take all (if any) profits they might earn on the play, reassuring her, "I don't . . . mean our friendship . . . to destroy any business relations that may arise . . . what's the good of being on the terms we are on&#x02014;if one mayn't do as one likes over it?" (FB to ER 15 Dec. 1892, Fales). Robins's interest in setting business (i.e. financial) terms for their collaboration no doubt conflicted with Bell's desire to act as generous mother and benefactor. But this potential conflict did not develop, as <i>Alan's Wife</i> made little or no profit even though it proved scandalous. Nor is there evidence of any financial disagreements between the two, as Robins's commitment to anti-commercial (i.e. typically anti-profitable) theatrical experimentation aligned her with Bell's class-based disregard for the business aspects of professional writing, permitting an easy alliance of two women separated by social, cultural, and national differences.
</p>

<p>
Their anonymity freed Robins and Bell to exploit the shock value of Ameen's story without suffering public identification as the authors of the play. Robins, who played the part of Jean Creyke, courted such danger, together with all Ibsen actresses who risked becoming typecast as "Noras" or "Heddas" and/or personally held responsible for the crimes of their fictional characters. The pair derived intense pleasure and amusement from this aspect of their secrecy, both of them careful to keep the play from their close mutual friend, Henry James, whom they felt sure would dislike it, as he could dislike things that were "middle-classy" and "Ibseny": "Oh don't let him throw cold water on it," Bell urged Robins.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Secrets were not, of course, the sole property of women dramatists; men also relied on disguise, ellipsis, and concealment to manage their careers. Archer, with a public image as a "scientific, rational" critic, closely guarded his passionate relationship with Robins. The celebrated Norwegian writer, Bj&#x000F8;rnstjerne Bj&#x000F8;rnson, asked Heinemann not to publish Robins's translation/adaptation of his 1877 novel, <i>Magnhild,</i> for fear the twenty year-old work would jar the music of his more recent writing (ER to FB 16 Dec. 1892). Eight years after <i>Alan's Wife,</i> G. B. Shaw would stage his first theatrical success, <i>Fanny's First Play,</i> anonymously, arousing great curiosity&#x02014;and accompanying publicity, helping to boost its run to 600 performances. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time that the Ibsenite avant-garde eschewed commercial theatre, they were discovering and exploiting their own forms of marketing, including not only calculated anonymity, pseudonymity, bourgeois affront, and the careful sequencing of their published work, but also a bid to raise the visibility and value of dramatic authorship through an Independent Theatre series of published plays. The series was short-lived, finally including only three plays given no advertising. But it anticipated Edwardian playwrights' eventually successful attempts to create a large readership for published plays from among the London <i>literati</i> and a growing, middle-class book-buying public. G. B. Shaw eventually would work out a program for publishing his plays as mid-priced, aesthetically designed books, and even succeed in making a profit 

<b></b>

from the sales of some of them.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The published text of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> with its contextualizing front matter&#x02014;J. T. Grein's Preface and Archer's lengthy Introduction&#x02014;amounted to an exhaustive manifesto, directly and indirectly declaring the theatre's aims, anthologizing critics' attacks on the anonymous play, and carving a place for <i>Alan's Wife</i> in theatre history as a modern tragedy. The two-layered introductory apparatus attempted to give the play material weight and critical heft among critics and professional taste makers, but the attempt proved irrelevant, given the small sales of the series (Shaw's 1893 <i>Widower's Houses</i> in the same series sold only 150 copies).
</p>

<p>
For their part, Bell and Robins exploited the opportunity available to dramatists to generate two distinct texts&#x02014;a performance text and a printed text&#x02014;as a means of satisfying two communities of interest: their live Independent Theatre audience and a hypothetical "literary" audience of book buyers, each of whom was presumed to have a unique response to the play. The authors inserted a subtle but significant stage direction near the conclusion of the published text intended to "translate" for the reader the subtext<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  of Jean's final performed silence: "(<i>Jean's sentences are given as a stage direction of what she is silently to convey, but she does not speak until nearly the end of the act.)</i>" These brief, printed thoughts, consisting of phrases such as "Poor Mother!" "I don't want mercy," "I am not afraid," anticipate Eugene O'Neill's later use of spoken asides<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  and imply Jean's depth of consciousness. But these printed phrases also function dramatically for the reader to underscore Jean's growing isolation and steady withdrawal from representation. Jean's final speech breaks this silence, offering another example of the authors' strategic separating of the performance and published texts. The 200-word performed monologue, complete with a recapitulation of Jean's justification for killing her child and a repeated assertion of her mother's love for the baby, is reduced to 66 words in the published text, edited to underscore the taut finality of Jean's dilemma ("I had to do what I did and they have to take my life for it") rather than to secure a live audience's sympathy for her crime, "It was I who loved him,&#x02014;loved him enough to do the only thing that could help him" (<i>AW,</i> 29). Under the cloak of anonymity, the authors of the published text could forego the special pleading of Jean's final performed speech.

<p class="noIndent">
What appeared to some critics as gloomy, fin-de-si&#x000E8;cle decadence preaching "race suicide" grew out of a vibrant set of flexible associations, including erotic love, fierce competition for rights to Ibsen's plays, loyal same-sex and other-sex friendships, maternal solicitude, and professional sponsorship. The modern mother, positioned between the forces of heredity, the subconscious, and a hostile industrial workplace, provided Robins and Bell with a set of references to their private lives and public postures on issues related to women's roles in a changing world that resonated with their Independent Theatre audiences and readers. <i>Alan's Wife</i> occupied a brief moment in the arrival of the London-based new drama, but its delivery offers striking evidence that theatre and paratheatre functioned as vehicles for modernist sociability. 

<b></b>

While the play's fable represents a stark confrontation between the intimate realm of maternity and the instrumental realm of law and industry, its genesis and production reveal the subtle contours and textures of gender and class interactions among men and women of the London avant-garde. Three decades after the appearance of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> theatre going, debate, and recitation were still informing modernist sociability. Virginia Woolf's diary entry for 23 June 1922 reads
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

He sang it &amp; chanted it rhythmed it. It has great beauty &amp; force of phrase; symmetry; &amp; tensity. What connects it together, I'm not so sure . . . One was left, however, with some strong emotion. The Waste Land, it is called.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
Semi-private performances like Eliot's have been hidden from histories of modernism. It comes as no surprise that the theatre and its forms gave modern artists a ready and flexible medium for observing themselves refashioning their social lives, but it is surprising that these gestures have been overlooked in accounts of modern art and culture.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In negotiating a new relation between the intimate matters of sexuality, motherhood, and family on the one hand, and public matters of law, politics, and commerce on the other, artists and intellectuals used the familiar forms of theatre and drama to display the "great divide" of modern culture for their pleasure and deliberation.

Shaw's recollection of the Ibsen reading appears in Stanley Weintraub, ed. <i>Shaw: An Autobiography 1856-1898 ,</i> Vol 1 (New York: Weybright and Talley, 1969), 96. Eleanor Marx's account appears in Yvonne Kapp's biography, <i>Eleanor Marx Vol. 2</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1977), 102-3. For James Joyce, Sigmund Freud, and Rainer Marie Rilke, Ibsen's plays remapped the relation between nation and the individual in exile, between public life and private life. James Joyce's admiration for Ibsen appears first in his review of <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>, "His genius as an artist faces all, shirks nothing. . . . He appears to have sounded (women) to almost unfathomable depths," and later in punning English/Norwegian references to Ibsen's titles in <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> ("For peers and gints, quaysirs and galleyliers, fresk letties from the say and stale headygabblers.") Quoted in Michael Meyer<i>, Ibsen: A Biography</i> (New York: Viking Penguin, 1985), 835; 834-37. Freud's 1916 essay on Ibsen's <i>Rosmersholm</i> is entitled "Some Character-Types Met with in Psycho-Analytic Work." See <i>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</i>, trans. and ed. James Strachey et al. Vol. XIV (London: Hogarth, 1953-1974), 324-31. Rilke opens his tribute, written four years after Ibsen's death, with the words, "Loneliest of men, withdrawn from all, how rapidly have they overtaken you by means of your fame!" (Qtd. in Meyer, 867).

Although three years following <i>Alan's Wife</i> the infamous baby farmer, the "Ogress of Reading," was hanged in Newgate prison for drowning at least 40 infants entrusted to her by parents, the historical record suggests that the last two decades of the nineteenth century saw a marked decrease in infanticides. During this period, the British crude birth rate fell by over 20% as married women took precautions to limit their fertility. See R. Sauer, "Infanticide and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century Britain," <i>Population Studies</i> 32: 1 , 90. The shift in attitude towards the bearing and rearing of children, based in part upon higher rates of infant survival, helped inaugurate modern motherhood.

In their rejection of Archer's rational doctor re, Bell and Robins substitute another Ibsen "type," the conformist cleric, who, like Pastor Manders in Ibsen's <i>Ghosts,</i> counsels Mrs. Alving to adopt a pose of resignation in the face of her own and her son's suffering. The choice of Manders as the model for Jean's rejected suitor underscores the authors' hardening of their mother's resolve and sharpens the polemical point of their drama.

This mimetic gesture looks back at least two centuries to literary and folkloric warnings about the objects proper for a pregnant woman's viewing. In the seventeenth century, Tomasso Buoni wrote in <i>Problemes of Beautie</i>, "Why is it the custome to hange Beautifull pictures in the chambers of those women that are with childe? . . . . This Perhaps because those strange occurrent, that in former times have fallen out, are an instruction to men in these dayes to prevent the like events: For great women by contemplating and gazing on serpents, and Moores in their chambers in the act of generation, have brought forth monstrous birthes, in some re and proportion like unto them." (Buoni, trans. Samuel Lennard [London: G. Eld for Edward Blont and William Aspley, 1606], 67-8). Describing eighteenth-century discourses on the subject, Julia Epstein writes, "According to the theory of maternal impressions, the birth of a defective infant unveiled the secret passions of its mother. . . . above all, the legitimacy of its parentage." ("The Pregnant Imagination, Women's Bodies, and Fetal Rights" in Susan C. Greenfield and Carol Barash, eds<i>. Inventing Maternity: Politics, Science, and Literature, 1650-1865</i> [Lexington KY: University of Kentucky Press, 1999], 118). The Ameen-Bell-Robins fable does not appear to resurrect this early belief but rather to offer evidence of the modern hazards of heredity for the most weak and vulnerable. My thanks to Patricia Phillippy for bringing the early modern sources to my attention.

I can find no support for the claim that the play reflects a eugenicist notion that the infant must be killed because he is too imperfect to live. The authors give this interpretation of Jean's motive to her mother, the play's representative of conformist sensibilities against which Jean's prodigious sensibilities are established. It's never presented as Jean's motive nor is there historical evidence that either Bell or Robins took seriously eugenicist claims of racial weakening. Florence Bell lightly mocks the idea in Chapter VIII of <i>At the Works,</i> "(W)e are constantly, anxiously, unavailingly, trying to prevent the much-discussed deterioration of the race" ; in 1926, Robins wrote near the conclusion of <i>The Secret That Was Kept,</i> "(W)hat childishness is this about race-purity" (qtd in Angela John, <i>Elizabeth Robins</i>: <i>Staging a Life 1862-1952</i> [London: Routledge, 1995], 227; hereafter abbreviated <i>ER</i>).

It bears noting that Jean's variety of religiousness (shared with Ameen's Emma) is vaguely low-church and pointedly unorthodox. She imagines a heaven where her family will be reunited but rejects all forms of religious consolation as offered by her mother and Jamie Warren. The effect is of a woman who will work out her own salvation and that of her innocent baby by trusting her native intelligence and emotional wisdom in an intuitively personal relationship with God. Heaven becomes a utopian version of life on earth.

The stage New Woman, ridiculed in Sydney Grundy's popular play, <i>The New Woman</i>, performed the year following <i>Alan's Wife,</i> was most clearly exemplified in public life by the professional actress, who enjoyed a unique social mobility, coveted her economic independence, traveled unchaperoned, and often held views promoting a woman's right to earn, to vote, to smoke, to choose "rational" dress, and to live alone. See Viv Gardner and Susan Rutherford, <i>The New Woman and Her Sisters: Feminism and Theatre 1850-1914</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1992), 1-7. The New Woman's politicized counterpart, the suffragist/suffragette, began to re-awaken in 1893, the year that Mrs. Pankhurst returned to Manchester from London and began organizing the first outdoor meetings that would become a hallmark of the movement.

Licensing was a system for regularizing government control over the content of printed stage plays. In England, dramatic licensing was formalized by the 1737 Walpole Stage Licensing Act and revised slightly by the 1843 Theatres Act. Both Acts required all theatres to submit a copy of their plays for official examination and subsequent licensing by the Lord Chamberlain, a court-appointed official who usually delegated the task to an appointed Examiner of Plays. Sometimes these reviews called for revisions (usually excisions); in rare cases, they banned plays outright. In the case of Ibsen's <i>Ghosts</i>, the Independent Theatre Society performed the play without submitting a copy to the Lord Chamberlain, who necessarily would have refused it a license.

Following the model of Antoine's Th&#x000E9;&#x000E2;tre Libre, Grein called for a subscription system by which audience members were to pay a set amount for the entire season of plays, giving them a sense 

<b></b>

of entitlement in the theatre's fortunes and avoiding government censorship by eliding the official definition of "theatre." Early in his planning, he wrote, "A moderate capital (say L2,000) derived partly from honorary contributors, . . . earnest subscribers . . . and small fees to be levied on each play . . . is all that is needed" (Qtd. in N. H. G. Schoonderwoerd, <i>J. T. Grein Ambassador of the Theatre 1862-1935: A Study in Anglo-Continental Theatrical Relations</i> [Assen (Netherlands): Van Gorcum,1963], 101.)
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
Grein's hope was to nurture native talent in the New Drama, but locating and encouraging original English plays proved difficult. See Schoonderwoerd, 119 ff. The theatre's slim budget required minimal sets, costumes, and effects, relying for its impact on the text of the play and the skill of the actors. It was, by default, a playwrights' and actors' theatre.

It is worth noting that Bell, a British national, a member of the titled class, and 11 years older than Robins, did not move in Robins's London circles and appeared slightly intimidated by the professional class of male critics and producers whom Robins had learned to manage. Her primary tie was to her friend, "Lisa," who stood deliberately between her and the Independent Theatre male establishment.

Archer nearly invented professional theatre criticism in the late nineteenth century. He served as theatre critic for <i>The World</i>, an urbane serial that nevertheless welcomed his earnest, intellectual reviews. He later wrote dramatic criticism for the <i>Morning Leader</i> and the <i>Star.</i> While with the <i>World,</i> he wrote occasionally for the <i>Pall Mall Gazette,</i> the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> the <i>Westminster Gazette,</i> the <i>Daily Chronicle,</i> and the <i>Morning Leader.</i> On a more regular basis, he placed major essays in such journals as <i>Fortnightly Review, Longman's Magazine, New Review, Nineteenth Century,</i> and <i>English Illustrated Magazine.</i> Thomas Postlewait, <i>Prophet of the New Drama: William Archer and the Ibsen Campaign</i> (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986), 34-40.

As Robins informed her collaborator, Bell, Archer counseled her to suppress her name as co-translator of Ibsen's <i>Master Builder</i>: "WA thinks it would unnecessarily emphasize my Ibsen proclivities. Besides giving them a chance to say, 'Let a shoemaker stick to his last' etc." (ER to FB Aug 16, 1892, F). He also advised her against appearing in matinees (as opposed to more prestigious evening performances) unless both the play and the part were "very good indeed to make it worth your while." And he often gave advice on actors suited to particular roles in plays she had purchased or written.

Grein's promissory letter to Robins refers to the hopeful expectation that IT projects would be offered with funding and that such funding would come from a "friend" of the artists: "I . . . hope that . . . you will convince some friend to loan me some financial aid for the . . . production" (JTG to ER 31 Dec. 1892, F) The self-selective nature of IT productions and funding depended upon and also constructed a social group with a strong sense of ownership of its events.

Findlater describes the "strange pact of mutual humbug" in which authors in this period would submit a play "mutilated in the way required by the Chamberlain, and the Chamberlain solemnly licensed it, although both knew perfectly well that the text he was approving would be given only one (or, in this case, two) performance(s)" . The typescript of <i>Alan's Wife</i> held in the Lord Chamberlain's collection in the British Library shows the omission of the suffocation scene. Further, Jean's final speech in the typescript (performed) version is longer than the same speech in the published version and attempts a more elaborate justification of Jean's actions.

As first stated in the <i>Weekly Comedy</i> of 30 November 1889, the aims of the Independent Theatre were to create a theatre "free of the shackles of the censor, free from the fetters of convention, unhampered by financial considerations" (Qtd. in Schoonderwoerd, 101.) But as the private negotiating between Grein and Piggot suggests, the Independent Theatre Society was not independent of the state's attempts to control artistic production, but rather collaborated with the state in establishing a limit of conditionally sanctioned expression reserved for an elite presumed to be sufficiently educated to dispense with a censor's advice.

The Bell/Robins friendship was deeply shaken&#x02014;but finally not broken&#x02014;only by Robins's political involvement with the militant Pankhursts, whom Bell felt had "hypnotized" her friend Robins into working for the suffrage cause and betraying her adopted country. But the friendship survived and, as Bell became older and more fragile, Robins even agreed to help with some of her friend's creative projects that may well have struck Robins as anachronistic (John, <i>ER,</i> 93-6).

Eliot claimed to have bypassed the "diffuse," "Romantic," "effeminate" British Decadent legacy that had privileged "sound" over "concrete image" in favor of French urban poets such as Charles Baudelaire or Jules Laforgue.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  And perhaps because modernism so successfully rid itself of A. C. Swinburne's infectious aural traits, critics have not recognized the profound <i>visual</i> impact of his pagan "natural" landscapes on modern urban/war poetry. In an age defined by world war and large scale technology, Swinburne's Decadent images of drowning and storm-shattered bodies accrued new iconic significance. Far from projecting utopian "romantic" visions of lost "unity," the Decadent's Sapphic sublime of elemental obliteration&#x02014;surfacing initially in H.D.'s (and Pound's) imagist, floral bodies whirled by a maelstrom of forces&#x02014;dramatized at once modernity's keenly shattering intensity and a correspondent awareness of corporeal fragility.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  It has become a commonplace that Eliot's Baudelairian "Fourmillante cit&#x000E9;" reflects back the alienated "etherized" modern subject. However, by contrast, Swinburnian pagan sites of death by drowning and snowstorm frequently stage spectacles of an Eliotic numbed body stung into sharp, percipient, erotic self-realization by the metropolis, world war, and technology. Thus in "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock's" concluding Swinburnian turn "seaward," modernity awakens the speaker into acute erotic sentience&#x02014;"human voices wake us, and we drown"&#x02014;from the bodily/perceptual haze of its overtly urban sections.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Images spinning out the "chilled delirium" and "beauty in terror" denied to a sensually deprived Gerontion who never 

<b></b>

"fought in the warm rain" propel the downed gull across Belle Isle's "windy straits" to its Swinburnian-Sapphic death by crystal, "white feathers in the snow" (<i>CPP,</i> 21, 23). Tim Armstrong argues in <i>Modernism, Technology and the Body</i> that technology renders the body supersensual.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  And Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" taken in tandem with "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" imply that under the pressures of modernity's life-threatening stimuli, all modes of perception&#x02014;erotic, aesthetic, visionary&#x02014;become predicated on "shock."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Further, Benjamin's choice of Baudelaire (Swinburne's master) as the lyric poet who best incorporates a shock-aesthetic capable of competing with film's blitzing medium, prescribes a modern poetics based on Decadent self-shattering structures of eros and imaginative self-realization. Thus Benjamin alludes to Baudelaire's equation of "the creative process" with a "duel" "in which the artist, just before being beaten, screams in fright" (<i>I,</i> 163). And, citing Baudelaire's "&#x000C0; Une Passante" as an illustration of "sexual shock" arising under the conditions of "urban traffic," Benjamin defines modern desire in terms of Decadent self-dissolving eros: in that poem, the citydweller is convulsed accordingly with "le plaisir qui tue" ("the pleasure that kills") by the lightning glance of a mysterious female stranger borne by the crowd (<i>I,</i> 168, 169).
</p>

<p>
Here I extend Benjamin's program for an urban "Baudelairian" poetics based on modern shock modes of perception to Swinburne's pagan landscapes, seeking to delineate a lyric Sapphic-Swinburnian "moment" in Eliot's (and other modern) poems. Like the more pervasive "futurist moment" Marjorie Perloff traces to Pound's "vortex," the Swinburnian "moment"&#x02014;cut, spliced, and mobilized in accord with modern filmic modes of attention by H.D.'s and Pound's imagist/cinematic "eye"&#x02014;shares a heady engagement with technology's speed, danger, immediacy, and attendant ruptured forms.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  However the fragile, Decadent body plunged in an imagist "vortex" of external forces, unlike F. T. Marinetti's avant-guerre "man at the wheel," sustained an elegiac pathos as well as mystic/erotic transport in the Janus face of technological "adventure" and war-ruin.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Jerome McGann's recent comments on Swinburne's "nature poetry" as a powerful "objective correlative" for "the immersive imagination" suggests its relevance to such a poetics/erotics of modernity's violent atmospherics: "when Swinburne's I/eye enters the natural world it gets engulfed . . . by tactile . . . immediacies . . . [A "dissolution" experienced from the perspective of] a percipient creature plunged within."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Related to this, while Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire forms a theoretical framework for this essay, my emphasis shifts from Baudelaire's darker Decadent fantasias of urban "vice" to the more childlike, Sapphic eros emitting from Eliot's submerging Swinburnian seas and chill rose gardens. Catherine Maxwell explores the resonances between Eliot's rose garden in <i>Four Quartets</i> and Swinburne's recurrent motif of a childhood "garden of memory."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Indeed, Eliot's incidents of vision and eros frequently evoke a regression to besieged childlike fragility and awe in drowning Swinburnian underworlds. "Marina's" hallucinated childhood "moment," told in Swinburnian sea/garden transpositions and prosody&#x02014;"whispers and small laughter between leaves and hurrying feet / Under sleep, where all the waters meet"&#x02014;(<i>CPP,</i> 72) later manifests as 

<b></b>

"Burnt Norton's" bewitching laughter in the rose garden&#x02014;"for the leaves were full of children, / Hidden excitedly, containing laughter"&#x02014;(<i>CPP,</i> 118) and reemerges in "Little Gidding"'s penultimate mystic juxtaposition of submerging garden and sea: "And the children . . . // . . . heard, half-heard in the stillness / Between two waves of the sea" (<i>CPP,</i> 145). Leo Bersani's elaboration on the origins of (male) receptive, self-shattering desire in the Freudian child's "thrill of being invaded by a world we have not yet learned to master" offers a psychoanalytic bridge between Benjamin's Baudelairian version of "shock" and the more childlike Swinburnian correlative I suggest here. Both Bersani and Benjamin base their respectively sexual and cultural scenarios of "shock" on Freud's theories regarding the pleasurable, unpleasurable effects of external reality's repeated blows to the human "cortex." However Bersani traces this pattern of impulses to Freud's essay on infantile sexuality describing the child's first haunted encounters with the outside world : "[Freud posits that] the infant . . . [o]verwhelmed by stimuli in excess of the ego structures capable of resisting or binding them, . . . may survive that imbalance only by finding it exciting."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Thus in Eliot's urban and war poems of sensory bombardment, his speakers appear to experience mystic/erotic transport as a return to early worlds "we have not yet learned to master." 
</p>

<p>
This view of Swinburne's pathos and immersive, pagan imagination coincides with the Decadent-Romantic Eliot and Pound had worshiped throughout their poetic apprenticeships and continued to admire in lesser known writings. The canon of preferred dramatic monologues from <i>Poems and Ballads</i> circulating among modernists' poetry and prose works favored poems "sung" from pagan underworlds of drowning sensory bombardment: "Itylus," "Before the Mirror," "A Leave-Taking," "The Triumph of Time," "Laus Veneris," among them.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Both Eliot's notes to his extension lectures on Swinburne and Pound's letters specifically celebrate the Decadent-Romantic's "pagan" mythmaking, and "championship of liberty" and stoic survival.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Further while Eliot's essay on Swinburne  dismissed Swinburne's storm imperiled "Snowdrops that plead for pardon / And pine for fright" as a failed objective correlative, he reversed his position tellingly in a later Turnbull lecture on the metaphysical conceit .<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  There he concedes significantly that Swinburne's elementally embattled ["Snowdrops"] correlate "our feeling toward small pathetic fragile human beings." Thus perhaps not incidentally, Eliot's (and McGann's) delineation of Swinburne's pathetic fallacy answers "Preludes'" call for images to embody the human subject besieged by urban life, that "infinitely gentle / Infinitely suffering thing" (<i>CCP,</i> 13).
</p>

<p>
However, as Eliot and others implied in their expositions on the modernist image/object, Swinburne's proliferating, overembellished imagery and repetitive "sound" could not hold modern modes of attention. Under the technologically informed "eye" of H.D.'s (and Pound's) imagism, Swinburne's already highly pictorial, pagan Sapphic sublime was effectively cut and photogenically enhanced by cinematic technique. As I will later discuss, <i>Sea Garden</i>'s subjection of Swinburnian ravished bodies to a barrage of cinematic innovations&#x02014;the close-up, montage, and sudden changes in place and focus&#x02014;assembled a powerfully influential "intertext" for Eliot, demonstrating how modern visualities could actualize British Decadent images of violent self-dissolution. 

<b></b>

Benjamin claims that early movements based on a structural optics such as cubism, Dadaism, and futurism mimicked and anticipated the film apparatus (<i>I,</i> 238, 250). And as he famously asserts in "The Artwork in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," modern attenuated and distracted modes of attention find aesthetic/emotional gratification particularly in the movie camera's visually assailing "lowerings and liftings . . . extensions and accelerations, its enlargements and reductions" (<i>I,</i> 237). Further, Benjamin's Baudelaire suggests the "possibilities" for a lyric poetry able to compete for modern modes of attention with the emergent film medium because he is a self-described '"kaleidoscope equipped with a consciousness,'" training "shock" techniques of the film apparatus on images of urban assault (<i>I,</i> 175). Benjamin emphasizes Baudelaire's citydweller in the act of visually capturing the modern crowd's onrushing siege, and turning the "camera" on himself, its dazzling recoil against his convulsing, hypersentient body.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Benjamin does not specifically include imagism among his list of early modernist movements based on optic structures, however its primary architect H.D. was well positioned to formulate a poetic "cinematic modernism." Schooled from childhood in technologies of the "eye" by her botanist/astronomer father and oceanographer grandfather, and already regularly attending "the pictures," H.D. would later apply her scientifically trained visual imagination toward avant-garde cinema and film criticism in the film journal she helped found, <i>Close-Up</i> (1927-1933).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
H.D.'s widely anthologized, optic rupturings of Decadent influence in <i>Sea Garden</i>  mined a storehouse of Swinburnian lines and images instantly available to Eliot, Pound, and other modernists. Thus, for example, in a 1914 letter to Conrad Aiken seeking to describing the wild gardens of Marburg, Eliot quoted Tanhauser's desire for self-obliteration "where tides of grass break into foam of flowers" from Swinburne's "Laus Veneris."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Five months earlier the <i>Egoist</i> had published H.D.'s "Oread" whose invocation to the gods in sea/forest transposition, "whirl up sea&#x02014; / . . . splash your great pines / on our rocks, / . . . cover us with your pools of fir,"<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  clearly finds a source in the fuller text of Tanhauser's prayer: "Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be / Where air might wash and long leaves cover me, / Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  However, as we will see, H.D. spins Swinburne's spectacles of bodily ravishment into optical/ mystical "play" through the cinematic operations of montage. While Tanhauser's prayer is orchestrated within what Robert Langbaum termed the Victorian monologues' Romantic, narrative "song of the self," H.D.'s rapid- fire sea/forest intersplicings of cones and circles doubly assail and absorb the "I"/"eye" in a volley of filmic technique.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Severing the time honored binary between Eliot and Swinburne and viewing Eliot's Decadent British legacy through the lens of modern visualities and cultural/historical forces challenges, among other things, oppositional and period restricted definitions of modernism.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  From the nineteenth-century side of modernity's spectrum, a modernism conceived in reaction against the "sentimental," "effeminate" past denies Swinburne's relevance to the elegiac and receptive desires infusing poetries of war and large scale technology. From the postmodern side, a modernism viewed as "reactionary" and "elitist" prevents inquiries into the early twentieth century's vital interactions 

<b></b>

with "progressive" literary forms and social, cultural, historical phenomena. Rather, Eliot may be positioned in a more inclusive modernity-at-large conceived as a rich and contradictory era extending from the late-nineteenth century to the present and encompassing engagements between "high" and "low" culture, technological change, and complex attitudes toward gender and sexuality.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Further, my focus on Eliot's poetic optics also seeks to restore "play"&#x02014; the sometime preserve of postmodernism&#x02014;both to Eliot's poetry and to the modernist image/object frequently accused of halting free-play in the logocentric correspondence "between word and thing."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Therefore, before proceeding to examine imagism's filmic, Swinburnian intertextualities and Eliot's ensuing optical transpositions of Swinburne's death by drowning and midwinter spring motifs, it would be useful to begin by summarizing some contact points between Eliot and modern visualities.
</p>

<p>
While critics are beginning to explore Eliot's linguistic innovations, the restive, technologically sophisticated "eye" that mobilizes his images has received little attention. Indeed, Eliot's "individual" transformations of poetic tradition were often predicated on the fragment or "sound bite" from the past both in his allusive practice and his image-making. He tellingly describes the memory as "a set of snapshots," "souvenirs of passionate moments." And the presence of cinema in Eliot's imagination is suggested both rhetorically and literally by his clipped, photographic conception of poetic influence as the "reborn image or word" surfacing not just from literature but from the "whole of [the poet's] sensitive life."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  As early as 1914, letters plotting an anticipated "ten reel" mock melodrama, "Effie the Waif," show Eliot's easy familiarity with the current cinema, its visual syntax, and dramatic possibilities. Frequently elaborated scene-by-scene and shot-by-shot, Eliot's film parody, like <i>The Waste Land,</i> is a quirky assemblage of disparate "scenes" sewn together by subtitles and moving from indoor melodrama to desert and plain, "([in a film] you must have either the plains or the desert if you expect a good pursuit)." The densely detailed plot spans years and continents, varying from tense, wistful close-ups betraying the actors' suppressed emotion to wide panoramas of India where the heroine wanders through jostling crowds, "(here a street scene with camels, monkeys (comic), and pythons)."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Accordingly, Susan McCabe who describes <i>The Waste Land</i> as the modern "montage poem par excellence," includes among its filmic techniques, "quick shifts between images," "unexpected juxtapositions," and "film tricks of flashback and forward motion." Eliot, McCabe specifies, "widens his lens" to portray crowd scenes reminiscent of D. W. Griffith's <i>Birth of a Nation</i> in "cascading visions" of "hooded hordes swarming / Over endless plains"; and I would add, rapidly narrows his lens in poignant imagist close-ups of the fragile drowned body amid modern ruin, "(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Aspects of Eliot's objective correlative repeatedly suggest his fascination with abrupt optical shifts such as changes in focus and montage. For example, Eliot's description of the conceit, which epitomized his objective correlative, gains its "powerful immediacy" from "sudden contrasts," a "telescoping of images and multiplied associations," and the implicitly visual yoking of "heterogeneous ideas" "by violence together" (<i>SE,</i> 243). Later, Eliot's direct, intimate experience with the filming of 

<b></b>

<i>Murder in the Cathedral</i> prompted sophisticated aesthetic observations on film's primacy of the "eye,"&#x02014;"[in] looking at a film we are always under <i>direction of the eye</i>"&#x02014;the role of the producer&#x02014;"you are, in fact, looking at the picture . . . through the eyes of the producer. What you see is what he makes the camera see"&#x02014;and film's immediate, assailing impact&#x02014;"the camera <i>must never stay still"</i>: "We are seized with the illusion that we are observing the actual event, or at least a series of photographs of the actual event; and nothing must be allowed to break the illusion."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Indeed, briefly, <i>The Waste Land</i>'s postwar "story" of Philomel's rape and mutilation cinematically "told upon the walls," may be seen to condense Swinburne's "Itylus" into a single moving picture. Among Swinburne's most affecting monologue issuing from "a percipient creature plunged within," Philomel's agonized song to her oblivious sister swallow is frequently cited as among the sources behind Eliot's refrain "O Swallow Swallow" throughout the <i>Waste Land Facsimile</i> and the published poem. (Indeed, H.D. who admitted to Swinburne's influence, would echo "Itylus'" refrain "O Swallow Sister" throughout her career from the early prose of the 1920s to <i>Helen in Egypt</i> [1962].) As if enacting a Benjaminean transition from the once meditative absorption demanded of lyric poetry and painting to modern modes of perception, Eliot's Philomel appears not in painterly repose "Above the antique mantel . . . displayed," but "<i>as though a window gave upon the sylvan scene</i>" (<i>CCP,</i> 40; emphasis added). Eliot's "scene" of the changed Philomel "So rudely forced" explodes onto our consciousness with the vividness and seeming reality lent by the "lens" (window) recalling Eliot's later comment on film, "We are seized with the illusion that we are watching the actual event." Swinburne's Philomel proclaims her ecstases of self-loss in an elaborate, narrative "song," shed "upon height, upon hollow," "Feed[ing] the heart of the night with fire" (<i>PB,</i> 61). While Eliot's postwar Philomel appears in animated close-up, forcibly apprehending the reader with the tactile intimacy of an imaginative/creative transport purchased at the price of war-time devastation<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  : "yet <i>there</i> the nightingale / Filled all the desert with inviolable voice" (<i>CCP,</i> 40). And Eliot's Philomel, like so many Waste Land inhabitants, recounts one among several tragic stories "told upon the walls" by "staring forms," "leaning" "out," struggling towards us with "withered stumps," each performing in savage close-up minute dramas of bodily undoing .

Imagism : Swinburne's Sapphic Sublime and Optical Technique
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Imagism has generally been dismissed in favor of voriticism as stationary, "referentially na&#x000EF;ve," and unconcerned with social and historical forces.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Critical advocates of imagism (and H.D.) however have observed importantly that Hugh Kenner inaugurates <i>The Pound Era</i> with imagism and its attraction to Sappho's "radioactive moments"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  ; that Pound's imagist tenets were fashioned around the optic dynamism of H.D.'s poetry (Pound places "Oread" in his vorticist manifesto beside the paintings of Kandinsky and Picasso as among the prime exemplars of the vortex)<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  ; and that <i>Sea Garden</i>'s embattled landscapes enact the upheavals of World War I. However, although Sergei Eisenstein compared the ideogram, among Pound's models for imagism, to the 

<b></b>

operations of montage, critics have yet to inquire into the film syntax of H.D.'s imagism.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  And, related to this, the connection between social/historical modernity and imagism's afflicted Sapphic (Swinburnian) floral tropes and luminescent bodies has yet to be examined.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Kenner first explored the Sapphic rhetoric of delicate flowers and fragility in imagism he ascribed to Pound's early "poeisis of loss."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Since then feminist critics have variously examined H.D.'s language of Sapphic flowers and its attendant Decadent-Hellenic legacy as manifestations of "Sapphic modernism," the literary phenomenon fashioned largely by women writers seeking to articulate a poetics of female/lesbian desire.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  However, Swinburne's finely wrought floral bodies flourishing in a "hostile clime" also described a modern body culture of keen corporeal hypersentience incited by technological duress for both men and women writers. A discernible chain of influences and aesthetic purposes evolves from Sappho's terse fragments on the throes of torturous love through Swinburne's elaborated landscapes of mystic/erotic self-shattering to H.D.'s embattled sea-flowers created in the years surrounding World War I. Thus Sappho's "Love . . . bitter sweet" or Longinus's famous allusion to her sublime as "Ice and fire" become Swinburne's salt/sweet, heat/chill landscapes where the "foam-flowers" "endure when the rose-blossoms wither" and winter collides violently with spring&#x02014;"When the hounds of spring are on winter's traces / . . . / And frosts are slain and flowers begotten."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In turn, <i>Sea Garden</i>'s imagist array of salt-encrusted, frost irradiated sea-flowers mystically transported by lashing winds and froth attest to modern embroilments in urban life, technology, and world war. 
</p>

<p>
Thus viewed through its Sapphic-Swinburnian legacy, the sudden flush of Pound's transparently yielding "Petals on a wet, black bough" may be seen as precipitated by the metro crowd's dark, crushing mystique even as it's stark colors provide apparitional contrast ("In a Station of the Metro").<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Like Benjamin's urban female re of "sexual shock" from Baudelaire's "&#x000C0; Une Passante," Pound's beautiful faces are constituted or borne by the crowd. And as their rain thirsty super-position implies, they have become fine tuned to the extremes of urban life, alternately screening and absorbing its everpresent "shocks." Similarly, Tim Armstrong attributes Mina Loy's floral evocations of "the skin as a porous membrane" and the "traffic across boundaries" to Loy's common theme of the "fragile" "penetrable" self "subsumed to technology."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  He cites as an example Loy's later poem from the sequence "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose"  whose overarching title (a reference to her English mother), imagery of leaves and rain, and alliterative prosody recall Swinburne. In that poem, the daughter is both "restringent" and hypersensitized to "the aura of subcarnal anger" emitting from the mother she elsewhere equates with "ringing metal":

However, Swinburne's Sapphic sublime also presents the body violently torn apart by oppositions, a splintering eros articulating the war-wracked body in H.D.'s <i>Sea Garden</i> and further enhanced by her rupturing cinematic/optical techniques. Yopie Prins aptly sums up this more lacerating aspect of Swinburne's "Sapphic sublime" as issuing from Sappho's fragment 130, "which dramatizes the effects of eros on a body that trembles in violent contraction, at the moment of coming apart": "And eros again the loosener of limbs makes me tremble / A sweet bitter unmanageable creature." Prins adds, "often called 'the loosener of limbs' in archaic Greek lyric, [Eros] describes a force so powerful it dissolves the joints and disjoins the body, disarticulating the parts from the whole."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  The following discussion of <i>Sea Garden</i>'s ravaged Swinburnian sea flowers explored largely in conjunction with modernist film criticism on magnification (the close-up), juxtaposition (montage), and rapid shifts in focus offers a set of visual/emotive "cues" for divining the obliterating Swinburnian-Sapphic "moments" in Eliot's poetry. 
</p>

<p>
Early French film critic Jean Epstein observes in his essay on "Magnification" that under the camera's dissecting gaze any "close-up" represents a "minute dramaturgy" of the object "flayed and vulnerable."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Already thematically "flayed," H.D.'s dashed and submerged floral bodies are additionally dismantled by the imagist "I"/ "eye's" deep penetration into the sea-flowers' magnified tissues in tight, overly bright close-up. Further, H.D.'s raw grained, marred flowers evince her early exposure to the "entirely new structural forms" revealed by the magnifying or telescopic apparatus that Benjamin equates with an "unconscious optics" (<i>I,</i> 237). Plied beyond "the naked eye" in densely magnified, harsh anatomical detail, they appear "cut in rock, "fluted," and "furrow[ed] with hard edge," displaying the corporeal supplementarity French Impressionists termed "<i>photog&#x000E9;nie.</i>"<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Thus driving wind abrades the "sea-lily's" photogenically calcified <i>skin</i>&#x02014;"scales are dashed / from your stem," "Myrtle-bark / is flecked from you" (<i>CP,</i> 14). Optic flashes of "entirely new structures" uncovered by <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> enact/induce the individual's amplified experience of splintering "shock" and carry the "I" into new psychic dimensions. 
</p>

<p>
Anticipating Eisenstein's description of the ideogram as montage, "Oread's" collision of "two depictables" (sea and forest) to represent "something that is graphically undepictable" clears imaginative space for "shock" in Swinburne's already liminal landscapes.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  While sea and forest are easily visualized in separate frames, "Oread's" disjointed, whirling points and circles can only be captured fleetingly by the reader's epistemological bridging of the gaps between:
</p>

As mentioned above, the nymph's plea for self-obliteration finds a source in the sea/garden juxtaposition of Tanhauser's prayer, "Cover me . . . // . . . where tides of grass break into foam of flowers" (<i>PB,</i> 15). Noting <i>Sea Garden</i>'s debt to Swinburne's borderline landscapes, Diana Collecott points out the importance of the "between" in Swinburne, exemplified by poems such as "A Forsaken Garden" which begins "At the sea down's edge between windward and lea." And Jerome McGann observes that Swinburne's poetry is "remarkably rich in boundaries."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  However, H.D.'s operations of montage compel both perceiver and "I" to undergo epistemological "shock" in the accelerated, violent crossing of sea and forest. At the vanishing point of entrance between rapid-fire intersplicings, "Oread's" reader joins the "I" in the tactile frisson of self-obliteration. This process also deploys Pound's imagist praxis of <i>Phanopoeia,</i> aptly described by Adalaide Morris in H.D. as "the act of throwing or shooting forth" onto the perceiver whereby the image bodily seizes the spectator.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  And Benjamin's comment on the film-like jolt of Dadaism's structural optics further implicates the corporeal "shock" of modernity in <i>Phanopoeia</i>: "[it was] an instrument of ballistics," "it hit the spectator like a bullet. It happened to him" (<i>I,</i> 238). Accordingly, early German cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer asserts that the film medium stimulates "the <i>material</i> layers of the human being: his nerves, senses, his entire physiological substance."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
H.D.'s calculated use of abrupt, long and short changes in focus often deploy what Gilles Deleuze described as "the pathetic" in camera technique whereby successive changes in the visual "quality" via "a series of enlarging close-ups" or other chains of changing foci provoke shifts of consciousness and emotion "to a higher power."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In H.D.'s well-known, much anthologized "Hermes of the Ways" and elsewhere a nuanced longing for elemental self-obliteration overtakes the "I" and the reader whose "eye" follows the same emotional trajectory through swift changes in prospect: beginning with hypermagnification (tense, painful proximity), followed by the photographic panning across vast spaces (escapist desires), and concluding with a telescoping in on the elementally-submerged minutia of a distant vantage point (fantasies of cool demise).

A pivotal sea-fragment from Eliot's <i>Four Quartets</i> signaling the speaker's withdrawal into solitary contemplation and spare, childlike simplicity ("my beginning"), invokes H.D.'s trajectory of the longing gaze. In an unwitting sound-image homage to H.D.'s imagist Hellenic "Hermes of the Ways," perhaps, Eliot directs the "I"/"eye" from "pointed," fevered close-up, across the sea, to telescopic scrutiny of cool, wind traced phenomena: (the lines from H.D. are in brackets):

Eliot's Imagist/Cinematic Swinburne:

</h3>

<h4 class="bHead">
<!--_bHead-->
Death by Water and Midwinter Spring
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
The Swinburnian-Sapphic sublime of Eliot's urban and war poetry performs the same assailing imagist/filmic improvisations on Decadent motifs of death by drowning and the lacerating midwinter spring. Thus, in its brazenly Swinburnian conclusion, "Prufrock's" wistful, sea-borne telescopic gaze&#x02014;"I have seen the mermaids riding seaward"&#x02014;lures both reader and citydweller outward toward the "shock" of a submerging modernity&#x02014;"human voices wake us, and we drown" (<i>CCP,</i> 7). The <i>Waste Land Facsimile</i>'s postwar drowned Phlebus presents the dis-located body in glassy, underwater close-up, unraveling beneath Swinburnian "torn algae . . . <s>purple, red."</s><sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  And, bearing witness to the World War II bomb that "breaks the air / With flame of incandescent terror," <i>Four Quartets</i> enacts spiritual seizure in the midwinter spring's killing 

<b></b>

juxtapositions of frost on flowers and fierce, luminescent light distractions (<i>CCP,</i> 143). Like Swinburne's (and H.D.'s), Eliot's pagan "minute dramaturg[ies]" of the body "flayed and vulnerable" frequently gesture toward a childlike pathos suggesting Bersani's abovementioned psychoanalytic relocation of erotic "self-shattering" desire in Freudian theories of infantile desire. Eliot's Swinburnian psychic landscapes often recall the speakers to their "beginning" and the sense of being overwhelmed by erotic longing, fear, and awe in worlds they "have not yet learned to master." Moments before his hallucinated death by drowning, Prufrock murmurs in childlike tones of wonder at the memory of mermaids riding tumultuous seas&#x02014;"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each / I do not think that they will sing to me" (<i>CCP,</i> 7). The narrator(s) observing Phlebus's dead body in the aftermath of a violent death by drowning assume elegiac tones of childlike tenderness and awe&#x02014;"(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)" (<i>The Waste Land</i>; <i>CCP,</i> 38). And Eliot's Swinburnian midwinter spring, as <i>Murder in the Cathedral</i>'s Tempter's promise of spring's return in winter suggests, signifies the sudden onset of youthful sexuality in old age (<i>CCP,</i> 184). Indeed, paradoxically, Eliot's own prose account of his early rejection of an "adolescent" Romanticism for a mature modernism describes the Sapphic-"Swinburne" that pervades Eliot's poems. In this particular scheme of poetic influence, Eliot begins by delineating his discovery of Romanticism as a "delicious and painful" seizure:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It [the discovery of the Romantics] was like a sudden conversion; the world appeared anew, painted with bright delicious and painful colours. Thereupon I took the usual adolescent course with Bryon, Shelley, Keats, Rossetti, Swinburne.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
and proceeds to equate it with the overwhelming (Sapphic) sensory immersion of youthful first love: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I take this period to have persisted until my nineteenth or twentieth year . . . Like the first period of <i>childhood</i>, it is one beyond which I dare say many people never advance. . . . [W]e must not confuse the intensity of the poetic experience in adolescence with the intense experience of poetry. At this period, the poem, or the poetry of a single poet <i>invades the youthful consciousness and assumes complete possession for a time. We do not really see it as something with an existence outside ourselves; much as in our youthful experiences of love, we do not so much see the person as infer the existence of some outside object which sets in motion these new and delightful feelings in which we are absorbed.</i><sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The submerging "feelings" absorbing Eliot's youthful poet and set in motion from somewhere "outside" suggest Benjamin's similarly random and objectless (albeit harsher) "sexual shock" emitting from modernity's "urban traffic." And notably, Eliot's dramatization of a poetic influence rhetorically predicated on "shock" illustrates the cultural incursion of modernity's violence on all schematizations of perception.

Elsewhere, modern writers summon Swinburnian monologues of victimized or sublime first love to convey the intensities of war. Wilfred Owen's homoerotic war poem "Greater Love's" proclamation of a love surpassing that of women for the more "exquisite"

bodies of his fallen comrades was written as a "response" to Swinburne's portrait of fragile, pining maidenhood ("Before the Mirror").<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  And perhaps it is no accident that Eugene O'Neill returns to abusive childhood memories and Swinburne in his raw, autobiographical play of oedipal love for an oblivious drug-addicted mother (<i>Long Day's Journey Into Night).</i> The play, composed during World War II&#x02014;"while he was full of anger at the Germans"&#x02014;concludes with a full recitation of Swinburne's suicidal (drowning) lament on unrequited love, "A Leave-Taking": "Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. // Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, / She would not hear / / Let us go seaward. . . ."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The subtle interweaving of Eliot's dramatic monologue "Prufrock" with "A Leave-Taking" has gone unexplored for several critically sound reasons despite the shared theme of unrequited love and climactic death by drowning. Important resonances between the poems include the echo of Swinburne's then-famous opening refrain declaring the speaker's suicidal intent&#x02014;Let us go hence [my songs; she will not hear]" (<i>PB,</i> 59) in Prufrock's "Let us go then"; and both poems' movement "seaward" where the speakers witness their own drowning: "I have seen [the mermaids] riding seaward on the waves / / When the wind blows the water white and black. / . . . / Till human voices wake us and we drown" ("Prufrock"; <i>CCP,</i> 7)/ "Let us go seaward as the great winds go, / Full of blown sand and foam . . . / . . . / . . . all those waves went over us, and drove / Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair" ("A Leave-Taking"; <i>PB,</i> 59, 60). Until now, a lengthy inquiry into Swinburne's influence on "Prufrock's" obviously Romantic ending may have seemed critically superfluous. From New Criticism onward, Prufrock's apparent hope and/or despair of creative/erotic "unity" with mermaid muses has often been dismissed as a retrogressively Romantic, sentimental afterthought. Were it not for the Swinburnian ending, "Prufrock's" echo of "A Leave-Taking's" refrain might also be explained as yet another Eliotic ironic counterpoint to the Romantic tradition: Eliot juxtaposes his derailed modern "love song" against Swinburne's sentimental lament. Rather than simply an escape into Romantic reverie, however, Prufrock's turn toward a Swinburnian drowning sea-scape may bespeak a collective, elegiac "song" of awakening into acute erotic sentience on the impact of modern urban/war "shock" experience. (We recall that the poem is dedicated to Jean Verdenal, Eliot's beloved friend slain in World War I.) Colleen Lamos argues importantly that Eliot's elegiac mode of desire is linked to "the motif of drowning" "relentlessly reiterated" from "Prufrock," <i>The Waste Land,</i> and "Hysteria," through <i>Four Quartets</i> and <i>The Family Reunion.</i> Lamos notes that his speakers appear to write their own elegies from "beneath the waves" where "death," forms "the condition of the possibility for . . . the expression of passion."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Within the larger cultural context of this essay, Eliot's elegiac eros may be aligned with Benjamin's predication of all modern modes of perception, including desire, on "shock." And the motif of eroticized death by drowning appears equally relentlessly in Swinburne's monologues well known to the moderns, "A Leave-Taking,"

<b></b>

"Laus Veneris," "The Triumph of Time," "Anactoria," "Satia Te Sanguine," "Ave Atque Vale" among them. Rather than the banished muses of lost "unity," Eliot's mermaids might therefore constitute the presiding geniuses ("nymphs") of a modern Swinburnian-Sapphic sublime. Hovering over the poem's erotically consummate cold, sea-plunge, they join the urban song of "human voices." Further the poem's Romantic afterthought refashions a modern filmic/imagist sea-fragment from Swinburne's "A Leave-Taking" replete with shifts in prospect (the longing gaze), juxtaposition (montage) and magnification (the close-up) 
</p>

<p>
Before discussing Prufrock's ending, it is important to distinguish briefly the contrasting influences of Baudelaire and Swinburne on the poem's strikingly divergent representations of the body as respectively "etherized" or catalyzed by cultural/historical forces. Critics have traced Baudelaire's equally complex impact on Eliot's lyric responses to urban modernity. However from <i>Inventions of the March Hare,</i> through "Prufrock" and <i>The Waste Land,</i> hybrid Baudelairian-Swinburnian versions of modernity coexist, reflecting by turns bodily alienation and hypersentience. While Baudelaire also lamented the fragility, suffering, and transport of his citydwellers as Benjamin and others have elucidated, Eliot's Baudelairian conception of modernity is overwhelmingly associated with the numbing horror of reviled desire. Thus his Baudelairian streets are populated by prostitutes and "vile old men," recurring in poems such as "Dans le Restaurant," with whom Nancy Gish associates the "I's" simultaneous attraction and revulsion toward desire.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Patricia Clements points out Eliot's debt to Baudeliare's fly-infested carcass, stinking "Comme une fleur" ("like a flower") ("Une Charogne") in "The Burial of the Dead's" corpse-flower: "That corpse you planted last year in your garden, / Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?"<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  And Maud Ellmann's catalog of Kristevean bodily waste ("abjection") infesting the waste land with litter, carious teeth, corpses, and cigarette ends may be traced back to Baudelaire and Jules Laforgue.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Baudelairian "abjection" most often numbs Eliot's citydweller and fellow specters of the "Unreal City," catapulting him into a state of attention deficit. By contrast, Eliot's Swinburnian-Baudelairian hybrids such as "Prufrock" and the below examined "Silence" moves from sensory disconnect in Baudelarian "static" to rapt attention and Swinburnian emotive reconnection.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's "Silence" which juxtaposes Baudelairian and Swinburnian forms of perception through the same sea/crowd metaphor illustrates this tension. Indeed, composed a year before the first draftings of "Prufrock" and echoing another stanza of "A Leave-Taking," the poem is among <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i>'s several brief, roughly worked "drafts" of the published poem. In the first half of "Silence" Eliot's Baudelairian urban traffic blares static interference at its confounded and distracted narrator:

Eliot's contrasting evocation of submersion in the heaving, multidimensional drama of human experience, "broad," "deep," "immediate," "steep," is enhanced by the specific echo, noted by Christopher Ricks, of the "deep" "steep" rhyme from "A Leave-Taking."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Significantly, there the echoed passage describes love's drowning, consuming "ways," couched in the typically Sapphic (bitter-sweet) language of passionate extremes: "how sore [ love's ways] are and <i>steep</i>. / / . . . Love is a . . . sea, bitter and <i>deep</i>" (<i>PB,</i> 60; emphasis added). "Silence's" crowd thus exhibits the experiential depths of romantic enthrallment.
</p>

<p>
"Prufrock" may be viewed as similarly structured by successive versions of a Baudelairian and Swinburnian modernity again drawing directly on Swinburne's "A Leave-Taking." The querulous, "vexed" and "debated" Baudelairian street scene of "Silence" greets Prufrock's passage "through certain half deserted streets" winding like an "argument / Of insidious intent." However, despite Prufrock's numerous hesitations, repetitions, and deflections he is simultaneously driven&#x02014;"let us go then"&#x02014;toward a similar erotic plumbing of modernity's depths in the poem's concluding Swinburnian sea/crowd submersion&#x02014;a "sexual shock" further induced by imagist/cinematic technique. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, while Prufrock's passage seaward from the claustrophobic parlors and steaming streets is initially compelled by the "ear"&#x02014;"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each"&#x02014;sound alone fails to make a connection&#x02014;"I do not think that they will sing to me" (<i>CCP,</i> 7). Rather the "eye" becomes the speaker's vehicle for the desired crossing into tactile, obliterating intimacies. Like H.D.'s "Hermes of the Ways," "Prufrock's" trajectory of the longing gaze draws the "eye"/"I" outward from smothering self-presence to cool relief at sea where it focuses microscopically on wind-tormented minutia, here of foaming seas, "comb[ed]" by mermaids:

Prufrock's desire to be immersed in the interstices "between" two elemental states&#x02014; "When the wind blows the water white and black"&#x02014;recalls once more Tanhauser's prayer in "Laus Veneris" "[that this flesh of mine might be] where tides of grass break into foam of flowers." However, taking his cue perhaps from "Oread's" imagist montage

<b></b>

of sea and garden, Eliot also draws the "I"/ "eye" to the space of "shock," here microscopically cleaved by the hair/wave superimposition: both Prufrock and the reader are arrested in the turbulent instant "<i>when</i>" waves "Comb[ed]" backward like "white hair" "blown back" produce finely textured streaks/strands of "white" and "black" ephemera (emphasis added). In obedience to Pound's elaboration of the image in his essay "Vorticism," the hair/wave juxtaposition derives its "beauty" from stark, oppositional (white/black) "planes in relation."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Simultaneously, the lines, "I have seen them riding <i>seaward</i> . . . Combing the white hair of the waves <i>blown</i> back," echo and implicitly follow "A Leave-Taking's" similar progress toward drowning self-obliteration in frothing sea, "Let us go <i>seaward</i> as the great winds go, / Full of <i>blown</i> sand and foam" (<i>PB,</i> 56; emphasis added). (And we note Eliot's use of Swinburne's characteristic assonance, alliterative "w's," and "s's," and quirky internal sound play&#x02014;"blown back," "blows . . . black.") Prufrock's shift from the irony and paralyzing self-consciousness of the urban sections toward childlike wonder and longing for self-dissolution in Swinburnian seas thus introduces a modern body culture of vulnerable receptivity and imminent violation. As in H.D.'s drowning sea-flowers or Loy's transparently fragile "leaves," Prufrock's delicate Swinburnian landscape/body may be said to gesture toward the penetrable self "subsumed to technology."
</p>

<p>
The final "shock" wave of tidal immersion&#x02014;"we have lingered in the chambers of the sea // Till human voices wake us, and we drown"&#x02014;need not be viewed entirely as a return from utopian dream worlds to the harsh reality of urban life (<i>CCP,</i> 7). Rather the two realms are yoked by violence together in Eisensteinian montage as the already sea-borne Prufrock "drowns" in the urban masses (those "human voices" comprising the poem's urban sections). The imploding sea now graphically and conceptually gathers the surging urban crowd, pulling the perceiver downward to a supersensory modernity. Prufrock realizes in the "shock" of the crowd his former longing to be covered, like H.D.'s Oread, in the frothing ferment of full waking/drowning sentience. While "A Leave-Taking's" languid eroticism is more overt&#x02014;"all those waves went over us and drove deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair"(<i>PB,</i> 60)&#x02014;Eliot's sudden cut to the sea/crowd juxtaposition he explored in "Silence," "we have lingered in the chambers of the sea // Till human voices wake us and we drown," both thematically and formally induces the convulsive seizure Benjamin links to the "sexual shock" of modern experience. "Prufrock's" concluding stanzas like Pound's <i>Phanopoeia</i> similarly ambushes the perceiver drawing him/her into a chain of visually absorbing, ever intensifying, optical readjustments toward the final cataclysmic surge.

In the clipped "Death by Water" sequence of <i>The Waste Land</i> Phlebus has already suffered the shock wave of war off-camera. The swirling, drifting, undulating body many have linked to Jean Verdenal forms yet another "reborn image" surfacing in imagist relief from Swinburne's poems. An oddly sentient (heat/chill) Sapphic body, "seen" through a watery lens, he lies caressed by cool currents in <i>Facsimile</i> drafts amid swaying "torn algae," "<s>purple, red</s>," revealing his Swinburnian-Sapphic legacy of passionately fevered, scarlet flowers and intricate, cool sea-algae:

Eliot's tender, childlike elegy to the whirling, rising, and falling sea-body recalls Swinburne's elegy to his French "brother," Baudelaire, in which the poet is likened to the drowned Sappho driven by oblivious tides : "The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear [her] / Hither and thither" ("Ave Atque Vale"; <i>PBII,</i> 72). In Swinburne's "The Triumph of Time" the lover similarly imagines his own drowned body entwined with a sea "mother": "I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside" (<i>PB,</i> 49). However Eliot seems to be responding directly to Swinburne's "Satia Te Sanguine" where the speaker compares his love tormented body to Sappho's "white," "feverish" drowned body "lift[ed]" by currents in "foam where the sea-weed swims":

Again, Eliot's Phlebus poses a hypersentient Swinburnian body transformed by violent self-dissolution against "The Burial of the Dead's" benumbed Baudeliarian specters of an "Unreal City." Yopie Prins cites the above passage from "Satia Te Sanguine" to exemplify Swinburne's Sapphic sublime of eros "the limb loosener" signifying the body's emergence at the moment of its own passionate dis-location.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Displaced to Eliot's modern war poem, Phlebus's turbulent undoing also initiates a crossing into strange childlike otherworlds where he suffers a wondrous seachange. Recalling H.D.'s "frost[ed]," flashing sea-flowers, "more precious" for their striving with the elements, or Pater's diaphanous slain youths, the stricken beloved is concentrated to a luminous point of light, "(Those are pearls that were his eyes.

Lamos dwells particularly on "Death by Water" as an example of Eliot's elegiac homoeroticism whereby the recurring motif of death by drowning enables his speakers to "achieve imaginary union with the lost [drowned young men] they tenderly describe." "Embracing in death like Dickens's mutual friends," she elaborates, "Eliot's speakers identify with the deceased in a gesture that commingles desire and resemblance" (<i>GDS,</i> 29). Within the cultural construct of this essay, the merging of the poem's "I" with the drowned body in a lover's embrace extends collectively to the elegiac eros of a submerged humanity. Eliot's Decadent slain youth, as in the early war poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, occasions an erotic lament for the fragile male body plunged in war ruin: "Death by Water" concludes with the appeal, "Consider Phlebus, who was once handsome and tall as you" (<i>CPP,</i> 47).

Midwinter Spring in <i>Four Quartets:</i> Death by Crystal
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
The eroticized transformation attendant upon Phlebus and Prufrock's death by water returns in Eliot's World War II devotional as a midwinter spring, spiritual paroxysm of floral bodies stunned by chilling/fevered extremes. Yet another site of the numbed (aged) body roused into (youthful) erotic/visionary fervor, "East Coker's" late-November writhing "snowdrops . . . under feet" and crystalline "Late roses filled with early snow" may be traced specifically to the pathetic fallacy from "Before the Mirror" Eliot cited as correlating "our feeling toward small pathetic fragile human beings" (<i>CCP,</i> 124). In that poem, Swinburne's love-blighted girl is by turns whiter than "Snowdrops that plead for pardon / And pine for fright," a "Late rose whose life is brief," and "a fallen rose / [Lying] snow white on white snows" (<i>PB,</i> 146, 147). Other instances of the snow smitten Sapphic body Swinburne associated with torturous eros recur in the poem literally entitled "A Vision of Spring in Winter" (<i>PBII,</i> 135-40) ; "The Leper," where the pangs of love are compared to "berries under snow" (<i>PB,</i> 135) ; "The Garden of Prosperpine's" "blind buds the snows have shaken" (<i>PB,</i> 195) ; and "Four Songs for Four Seasons'" "Deep in the snow's bed bury the rose" (<i>PBII,</i> 165). However, both "East Coker's" and "Little Gidding's" escalation of the midwinter spring into blinding, spiraling emanations of frost and fire also evoke the transporting, predatory collision between winter and spring from Swinburne's <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i> Leslie Brisman terms "a panorama of sex and violence": "When the hounds of spring are on winters traces // And frosts are slain and flowers begotten."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
I conclude here by focusing on the midwinter springs pictured successively in Eliot's "East Coker" and "Little Gidding" as optically blitzing war-time emanations of the Swinburnian-Sapphic sublime. Evoking both Swinburne's elegiac pathos and mystic/erotic transport, the midwinter spring's frost/fire light "distractions" and phosphorescent snow-encrusted bodies attest to Eliot's omnipresent consciousness of the World War II "dove [that] breaks the air / With flame of incandescent terror" (<i>CCP,</i> 143). Eliot's service as a firewatcher on the lookout for fires caused by bombs during the Blitz might have disposed him more urgently to "shock" modes of processing desire, spirituality and aesthetics while composing the poem.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Noting the juxtaposition of conflagrations in a philosophical context, F. O. Matthiessen links the Christian/Dantean 

<b></b>

"rose of light" to "Little Gidding's" "incandescent" bomb "that must blot out either London or Berlin" as mutual expressions of Christianity's "inscrutable terrible fire of Divine Love."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Eliot himself asserted that "there are really three roses in the set of poems; the sensuous rose, the socio-political Rose . . . and the spiritual rose [all] in some way . . . identified as one."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  I would add that Swinburne's pagan crystalline roses lend a body, albeit of a beset Sapphic eros to "the sensual rose" often directly presaging the poem's frost/fire imagery of war-destruction. Richard Badenhausen and Elisabeth D&#x000E4;umer discuss Eliot's growing attraction toward a classical "pagan" world of natural forces in plays such as <i>Murder in the Cathedral.</i><sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Thus Eliot's erotic, luminous pagan roses "filled with early snow" bear the "incandescent" trace of technological warfare even as they glow beneath "the rose of light's" symbolic enfoldings. 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's repeated recourse to Swinburne's Sapphic sublime for his benumbed modern bodies roused to lacerating sentience by urban/war technology targeted in particular "Before the Mirror's" winter-spring juxtaposition "a fallen rose / [Lying] snow-white on white snows." The Decadent objective correlative and its chain of Swinburnian echoes binds <i>The Waste Land</i>, "Gerontion," and <i>Four Quartets</i> respectively, as the "cruellest month" visits fevered memory and desire on its numbed postwar inhabitants, "dried tubers" in "forgetful snow" (<i>CCP,</i> 37); an aged Gerontion dreams of a "chilled delirium" conjuring the perished gull, "White feathers in the snow" (<i>CCP,</i> 23); and "East Coker's" rending midwinter spring connotes mystic/erotic invasion, "Late flowers filled with early snow" (<i>CCP,</i> 124). Moreover "East Coker's" conjoinment of war, assailing imagist/vorticist technique, and Swinburnian self-shattering eros is underscored by its direct descent from "Gerontion's" vision of "chilled delirium." Eliot's desire to use "Gerontion" as a prologue to <i>The Waste Land</i> (which Pound discouraged) implicitly associates war experience with the terror and delirium granted the snow-smitten body but accessible only in dreams to the old man who did not t in the war.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Further, in both passages the chilled delirium is activated by optic technique, recording in imagist close-up the crystalline toll on an enraptured Swinburnian-Sapphic body and spiraling telescopically toward a fiery/chill constellational frenzy of heavenly bodies anticipating war-time violence. Thus Gerontion's vision of the "beauty in terror" denied to him accelerates the perceiver from a decimating constellational orbit "whirled / Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear / In fractured atoms" downward to the gull's crystalline demise:

Microscopically enhanced, the "naturally" blurred image of white gull on white snow gains its "terror" and poignance through imagist "planes in relation" beyond the naked eye revealing in magnification evanescent, finely textured feathers splayed against chill crystal. H.D.'s salt-encrusted, imagist sea-violet drew similarly on the frost/flowers/star complex which Charlotte Mandel links to her experience with the telescope and

the microscope: "Violet / your grasp is frail // but you catch the light&#x02014; / frost, a star flashes with its fire."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  And in "Hyacinth" the slain youth's delicately veined hands are "Snow craters filled / with first wild-flowerlets" (<i>CP,</i> 201).

"East Coker's" midwinter spring reverses the spiral, beginning with the midwinter spring's frost/fire massacre on delicate floral bodies surprised into hypersentience:

In the remainder of the passage, "East Coker" enjoins the "eye" to spiral upward from the crystalline body toward fiery chill "constellated wars" where "Comets weep and Leonids fly" "Whirled in a vortex" (as opposed to "Gerontion's" "circuit"; <i>CCP,</i> 125). Notably, here Eliot acknowledges the impact of his early imagist/vorticist training on images of war-destruction and obeys his own later injunction, "<i>the camera must never stay still.</i>" Indeed Swinburne's Sapphic sublime may yoke "Gerontion's" crystalline gull to "Little Gidding's" radioactive dove, both of whom descend toward "terrible" irradiated destruction. Swinburne delineates airborne ecstasy as intrinsic to Blake and Whitman in an unwitting tribute to his own Sapphic sublime in <i>William Blake: A Critical Essay</i> (well known to Eliot and probably discussed among other "prose" during his extension lectures): "[one may discover in their poems] an expanse and exultation of wing across strange spaces of air and above shoreless stretches of sea; a love of liberty in all times and things . . . tender . . . and bitter."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>

Finally the swift onset of "Little Gidding's" midwinter spring is represented largely as an assault on "the eye" through rebounding, dazzling light on snow:

In a passage suggesting at once the bomb's "incandescent terror" and more obliquely, modern cinema, light optically flays the spectator. Glancing off surfaces at erratic angles, the blinding glare lances "the material layers" of the body, in Kracauer's 

<b></b>

words, the "nerves," "senses," "the entire physiological substance," reaching rhetorically into the body's fluid interiors: "The soul's sap quivers." Here again, Eliot directs our attention to the Swinburnian in-between of liminal elemental boundaries as the site of "shock." "Between melting and freezing," the perceiver is prompted to occupy the gaps "between" wildly deflecting and reflecting light momentarily undimmed by moist or crusted opacities. Vaulting and rebounding visualities, in accord with Deleuze's description of the "pathetic" in film technique, also convey a leap into vision, "the sense that consciousness is also a passage into a new dimension, a raising to the power of two." Similarly, in H.D.'s "Hippolytus Temporizes," Hippolytus's pagan vision of Artemis&#x02014;"Ah splendor my goddess turns"&#x02014;stuns his "brain" with repercussive light: "the flash of sun on the snow, / the fringe of light and the drift, / the crest and the hill-shadow" (<i>CP,</i> 122). And H.D. extends the Decadent/Hellenic trope to the "gift" of "light" bestowed by the shattering film "god," in "Projector II," "This is his gift; / light, / light that sears and breaks us" (<i>CP,</i> 353). Three sections later "Little Gidding's" war-time "dove descending" similarly "breaks the air / With flame of incandescent terror" (<i>CCP,</i> 143). Shortly thereafter, Eliot makes a moral distinction between the fires of purgation and of destruction (lust, war): "We only live, only suspire / Consumed by fire or fire" (<i>CPP,</i> 144). However the poem's yoking of Decadent, cinematic, and historical conflagrations suggests the pervasiveness of "shock" as a structural entailment of seeing, being, and loving in the modern age.

Walter Benjamin, <i>Illuminations: Essays and Reflections,</i> ed. Hannah Arendt, trans. Harry Zohn (New York: Schocken Books, 1968); hereafter abbreviated as <i>I.</i> Armstrong offers a delineation of the way in which Benjamin's conception of "shock" is used in this essay. Armstrong points out that "shock" in Benjamin as in Sigfried Kracauer's "The Cult of Distraction"  may be seen not only as a disengaged, fragmented form of attention but also as a shattering dis-location by which the spectator is "shocked out of the seamless narrative of the bourgeois artwork by the cinema's 'fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions'" (<i>MTB,</i> 216). Armstrong also points out the important contradiction in Benjamin (and Kracauer) on the "shock" effect of modern media which on one hand views it as "the vehicle of social pessimism" "reflect[ing] back" "an alienated existence" and on the other as "a utopian possibility which might open up new modes of perception" (<i>MTB,</i> 217). This essay draws on the latter conception.

Leo Bersani elucidates his theory of ecstatic "self shattering" male desire in <i>Homos</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995), but he had already made the connection between Freud's theories on stimuli and Freudian theories of infantile sexuality in <i>The Freudian Body: Psychoanalysis and Art</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986). Bersani draws on Freud's <i>Three Essays</i>, quoting Freud's assertion in <i>Homos</i> that "all comparatively intense affective processes, including terrifying ones [spill over into sexuality]" and noting that Freud includes "railway travel" (100, 101). Benjamin bases his exposition of "shock" in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" on similar aspects of Freud's theories concerning external stimuli and sexuality from <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle.</i> (<i>I,</i> 160-2).

Eliot notes Swinburne's "paganism," his "championship of liberty," and his romanticism in notes to his extension lectures quoted by Ronald Schuchard in <i>Eliot's Dark Angel: Intersections of Life and Art</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 40. In Pound's letter to Margaret Cravens (op. cit.) he notes Swinburne's poetics of "liberty" and calls him the "inspirer of men." Several critics have written on Swinburne's pagan poetics and his romantic mythmaking. See especially David G. Riede, <i>Swinburne: A Study of Romantic Mythmaking</i> (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1978); Margot K. Louis, <i>Swinburne and His Gods: The Roots and Growth of an Agnostic Poetry</i> (Montreal, Canada: McGill-Queens University Press, 1990); Jerome McGann, <i>Swinburne: An Experiment in Criticism</i> (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1978); and Pauline Fletcher, <i>Gardens and Grim Ravines: The Language of Landscape in Victorian Poetry</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1983).

429-52. Susan McCabe's forthcoming book, <i>Cinematic Modernism,</i> examines, among other things, the impact of film and Benajamin's "shock" aesthetic variously on poetic language, the dis-located bodies within modernist poems, and on the body of the poem itself: "[The] body of the modernist poem gained new angles, line-breaks, asymmetries and synapses, shifting within and through the very technologies that disoriented the relationship of the human body . . . " (unpaginated manuscript). Michael North addresses modernism and film in <i>Reading 1922: A Return to the Scene of the Modern</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), and more specifically in "Words in Motion: The Movies, the Readies, and 'the Revolution of the Word,'"  9. 2 : 205-23.

There have been very few considerations of Eliot and Swinburne.

Rikky Rooksby and Nicholas Shrimpton (U.K: Scolar Press, 1993), 136-47. Morgan argues persuasively for the influence of Swinburne's prose on Eliot's definition of himself as a modernist.

In April 1908, not long before his career-ending mental breakdown, Arthurs Symons published a notice in the <i>Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society</i> titled "In Praise of Gypsies."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Though brief, the essay is freighted with the exoticism characterizing most gypsophilia at the time&#x02014;indeed, characterizing most ethnographic endeavors of the early modernist period. The occasion for Symons's essay was the impending passage of the Moveable Dwellings Bill, the aim of which was to register, regulate, and provide for the sanitary inspection of the vans and tents of British Gypsies and Travellers, and to mandate the education of their children.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But Symons's indignation in the face of this proposed legislation&#x02014;which, he claims, will "shuffle (the 'Gypsies') right off the very earth to which they have the universal human right" &#x02014;is largely disconnected from the actual social conditions of the Romani populations in England and Wales ("PG," 298). Instead it springs mainly from Symons's investment in the fictional romantic re of the "Gypsy," a "natural man" whose instinctual drive for freedom leads him away from civilization's gatekeepers along a secret and infinitely receding road limning the outer reaches of modernity. 
</p>

<p>
Symons repeats all of the nineteenth-century tropes of orientalism and race, mysticism and ahistoricity: "Gypsies" are "changeless: the world has not power over them. They live by rote and by faith and by tradition which is part of their blood" ("PG," 295); they are "prophets," "our only link with the East, with mystery, with magic"; they are possessed of the "lawlessness, the abandonment, the natural physical grace in form and gesture, of animals; only a stealthy and wary something in their eyes makes them human" ("PG," 296). They are the atavistic 

<b></b>

trace of the rural, pre-modern world, and they will remain when "cities and nations have vanished, as the dust vanishes before the wind." <sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  The robust, though elusive re of the "Gypsy" is an elixir for the desiccated spirit of the West, at least in the eyes of this fading avatar of Symbolism; even the well-known "Gypsy faults" of "secrecy," "lying" and "thieving" can be lessons in anti-modern resistance for the perceptive man who will but recognize them ("PG," 297-98). Thus Symons replicates one vector of the multivalent re of the <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> (non-Romani) creation called the "Gypsy." This is the celebrated Romani "Gypsy," an emblem of natural liberty, unencumbered mobility, communal loyalty and harmony, admirably impervious to manipulation by the state and everywhere subverting the disciplinarity of evolving modern institutions. 
</p>

<p>
But of course there were other more dominant and historically entrenched vectors of representation, lingering on from pre-romantic policies of xenophobia and mid-empire racial sciences, heightened by the coalescence of wage labor after the major phase of the industrial revolution, and disseminated in the parallel discourses of national character and social control of the nineteenth century. According to these, the perceived freedoms of the "Gypsy" were in fact manifestations of congenital lawlessness, habitual restlessness, a perversely arrested sense of domesticity, and&#x02014;perhaps most dangerously&#x02014;a resolute unwillingness to settle and perform "honest" wage labor. The fabled insularity of "Gypsy" communities was proof of a radical alterity that might be anti-statist or anti-Christian or just plain criminal in origin; in any case it was seen to shelter illiteracy and uncleanliness, and perpetuate itinerant poverty. 
</p>

<p>
However divergent the affective force of these positions might have been, both the celebratory and suspicious views of the "Gypsy" shared some important assumptions, as they were largely flip sides of the same ideological coin: the British "Gypsy" (in spite of 500 years of Gypsy-Traveller populations in England) was foreign, or at least fundamentally not-English; it was also, for all of its proud self-sufficiency, notably&#x02014;even recidivistically&#x02014;primitive. For both champions and detractors, the re of the "Gypsy" seemed to reveal something about the leaky valves of modernity: living in the midst of "progress" (in a country where the institutions of modernity had been established especially early) the "Gypsy" somehow&#x02014;actively&#x02014;avoided modernity's ineluctable telos. Such a re could be of great value both to proponents of social control and dissenters from liberal reform, and in fact it is precisely this kind of contradiction that shadows the "Gypsy" re and justifies the claim that he stood for both "exemplary autonomy [and] feared alterity."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  I would only add that to say this is also to acknowledge on some level the "Gypsy's" status as an ideological sign under pressure in a distinct historical moment. And while that sign rarely accommodated or even registered the labile status of actual Gypsies and Travellers, it was never equipped to do such a thing. The "Gypsy" is in most usages a re of the European imagination bearing little resemblance to&#x02014;indeed, often obscuring&#x02014;the historical lives and material conditions of the Romanichal, Rom, Lovari, Kalderash, Sinti, Coppersmith, and Gitano peoples of Europe.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

With the title of this essay I mean to suggest a fundamental relation between modernism and the continuously evolving <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> construction of the "Gypsy." More specifically, I wish to argue that modernism, and in particular several threads of British modernism, take for a covert model of communality and subjectivity the peripatetic, ahistorical "Gypsy," whose actual historical counterparts filled contemporary newspapers in stories of forced mass evictions and county council Acts. Katie Trumpener has already broken one part of this path by tracing European literary representations of "Gypsies" in the eighteenth through twentieth centuries, and especially by marking an early nineteenth-century shift in representation of the "Gypsy" from a re of alternative archaism to an emblem of "both the traditional and the colonial unconscious of an industrializing, imperialist Europe&#x02014;the trace memory of the traumatic cost of improvement and expansion."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  One aspect of Trumpener's argument is that, during the course of the nineteenth century, the "Gypsy" increasingly becomes a textual device that on the one hand disrupts cultural memory and temporality, and on the other hand, as a result of the heightened stylization of "Gypsy" characters, acts as a marker of the shifting uses of literary genres.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
It is certainly possible to extend this line of argument into a reading of the cultural products of modernism, showing how the "Gypsy" re persists, and even proliferates, both as an operative element in many works of modernist literature and as a popular model for the "modern" lifestyle."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  For the record of modernism is shot through with overt and implicit references to "Gypsy culture." Not only do "Gypsies" appear in myriad poems and novels of the modern period&#x02014;one has only to think of the parodic Madame Sosostris to recognize the hinge between modernism's fascination with occult divination and the long-established trope of "Gypsy" fortune-telling&#x02014;but the imagined culture of the "Gypsy" appears persistently in some of the most important modernist social formations. The Bohemian salon is one of these, wherein occurs, as I have argued elsewhere, a cultivation of sociability modeled in part on an aesthetic of intransigence and anti-modern insularity.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In its more popular manifestations, the vaunted "freedom" of modern life finds its correlatives in "free verse," "free dance," and "free love," the latter two of which were widely (though falsely) reputed to be practices in "Gypsy" camps. "Gypsy" costumes (Mabel Dodge in her turban, Augustus John in his high leather boots), "Gypsy" music (Ottoline Morrell's salon guests dancing wildly to Hungarian piano music), and the "Gypsy" restlessness of writers as diverse as Arthur Symons, D.H. Lawrence and John Reed, all helped to form a cultural matrix which, though fictional in its origins, nevertheless anchored a divergent community of self-identified moderns.
</p>

<p>
Several scholars of the modern period have also noted the indebtedness of the so-called "open-air" or "tramping" movement to nineteenth-century romantic accounts of the travelling "Gypsy" life. Rooted in a growing urban nostalgia for an imagined rural past and fueled by the popular narratives of George Burrow and other who called themselves Romany Rye (or "gentleman friends" of "Gypsies"), "tramping," and 

<b></b>

"caravanning" become something of a national recreational pursuit in the 1880s and afterwards.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  George Behlmer, for one, argues that the cultural anxieties underpinning this fad&#x02014;including fears of green England's extinction, and a concomitant loss of traditional Englishness&#x02014;were instrumental in transforming the English "Gypsy" from "social outcast into [a] noble savage" ("TGP," 237) who was available to represent "the hardy competence associated with true" country folk. Once mid-Victorian cultural critics began insisting that prosperity had been won at the cost of physical languor and a slavish regard for the norms of polite society, Gypsy waywardness could be seen as a virtue rather than a vice" ("TGP," 239). Indeed, from the position that viewed English national character in decline, threatened by empire-driven immigration, urbanization, and commodification, the valorized English traits of taciturnity, physical vigor, and self-sufficiency could all be recuperated in the mythical and conveniently available re of the "Gypsy."
</p>

<p>
These lines of thinking about cultural representations of "Gypsies," though historically and politically important, nevertheless have their limits, at least from a certain perspective within modernist studies. One could justifiably claim, for example, that British modernism cannot be adequately understood without some recognition of its co-optation of popular <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> narratives of "Gypsy" culture (which, it must be stressed, bore only the most tangential resemblance to the complex and heterogeneous lives of English Gypsy-Travellers throughout British history). But this approach would need to take us further than the tidy conclusion that, since "Gypsy" culture is a <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> construction, modernism's putatively rebellious co-optation of "Gypsy" culture is in fact little more than a new adaptation of a fairly dominant cultural myth. On this view, modernism that deals implicitly or explicitly with "Gypsy" themes and rations is <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> modernism, to be critiqued as always already inauthentic and culturally colonizing. In the end, such an approach to <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> modernism tells us very little about Gypsies or modernism. So while I believe it is valid and instructive to pursue the textual record of the <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i>/Gypsy relationship into the field of modernist literature, my aims here are rather different. Instead of searching out and condemning modernist representations of "Gypsies" as debased or romanticized examples of racist practices, I intend to explore the problematic generated by the idea of the "Gypsy" as a putative subject of modernity, girded as that idea is by the historical forces exerted in the opaque relations between <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> and Romanies. I want to suggest how these relations have been knitted into the some of the discourses and cultural formations of modernism. 
</p>

<p>
Modernism attends to the paradoxical incompleteness of modern subjectivity, which is on the one hand self-conscious, rational, and poised to interpret the world-as-representation, and on the other hand riven by gaps in consciousness that are increasingly thrown into relief by modern epistemologies.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Modernist sociologists&#x02014;in particular, George Simmel, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber&#x02014;tend to approach modern subjectivity as a symptomatic effect of fragmenting historical/economic forces. They point to rationalism's detachment from value (which is lost through the modern disenchantment of the world) and its ungrounded proliferation within increasingly dissociated systems (functionalist social forms, bureaucracies) which take as their ends the reproduction 

<b></b>

of rationalism. Less starkly, though no less insistently, modernist aestheticians, ranging through a variegated spectrum that includes Virginia Woolf, W.B. Yeats, Mary Butts, James Weldon Johnson, Mina Loy, Melvin Tolson, and Djuna Barnes, view the self-reflexivity of modern subjectivity as both the re and ground of the modern art problematic. On the one hand, the representation of consciousness becomes the utterly impossible as well as the only task for artists who must reject epistemological realism. On the other hand the task of representing positively the modern community against and through which modern consciousness takes its shape becomes equally compelling, since the accelerated diversification of modern social structures ensures that there can be no fit between an individual and any one community. Identity is necessarily striated across a series of function-groups (economic, social, sexual, national,and so forth), and this process reveals retroactively the absence of organic or originary communities through which the "I" of the artist secures value and ground in modernity. Within the field of recognizably modernist aesthetic practices, literary experimentation takes as one of its objects the portrayal of subjectivity not simply as consciousness but rather as consciousness being made and unmade in its relation to others. The rendering of individualism within sociality entails, for modernists, an avoidance of the ideals associated with "possessive individualism," which depend upon regulated economic and political relations, and guarantee in advance the easy substitution of heteronomy for autonomy. Instead, what modernists aim to explore across a whole political range are the shifting connections between the labile structures of consciousness and labile forms of community, in order to reveal both the depersonalizing forces inherent in "modern" society and the creative possibilities for countermodern forms of sociability. 
</p>

<p>
When community is placed front and center in an analysis of modernism's projects, the attraction for modernists of the lives of Romanichals in Britain becomes clearer. Up until the modernist period, the historical record of the Romani diaspora was minimally elaborated and poorly understood by the dominant culture, to say the least. Whatever discontinuous narratives floated in the European imagination tended to be characterological in nature: a mysterious "race" had appeared in Europe "quite suddenly one day, without anyone being able to say exactly where it had sprung from," in Franz Liszt's influential words.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The striking characteristics of these people, for Europeans invested in the establishment and proliferation of settled nation-states, were related to their perceived intransigence and willful unassimilability. Confusion about origins (registered, for example, in the Egipcion/Gypsy lexicon that prevailed in England until 1715)<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  transmuted easily into a teleology of uncertainty: not only was their sociological role in the narrative of modern progress unreadable, given the anachronism of their migratory tendencies, but the very character ascribed to them reflected nothing so much as uncertainty within the dominant culture. So the characterological properties of secrecy, insularity, cultural autonomy, inscrutability (or lack of transparency), and detachment, all imposed from without, were, properly speaking, the negative markers of the failure of discursivity. And what <i>could</i> be known through the most superficial observations could not be made to fit within the burgeoning narratives of 

<b></b>

nineteenth-century modernity. As a people understood to be living hardily outside of the domains of hygienic and health sciences, for example, their unflagging survival was deemed extraordinary.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Similarly, their self-employment&#x02014;read (perforce negatively) as a resistance to wage-labor&#x02014;could only be interpreted as an exceptionalist fluke, a pocket of sluggish impermeability in the dominant economic system. And the persistence, in Romani social structures, of what looked to be an aberrant <i>Gemeinschaft,</i> was rarely received on its own terms, and instead bent against an ideological model of house-centered domesticity. 
</p>

<p>
What I am thinking of as an aberrant <i>Gemeinschaft</i> requires a brief elaboration here. In Ferdinand T&#x000F6;nnies's original (nostalgic, modernist) sociological formulation, <i>Gemeinschaft</i> describes a rural, organic community "ennobled," in his words, by tradition and religion and bound by positive or extrinsic law, which regulates the necessary harmony of wills within the community. Implicit in this conception of traditional self-regulation, and explicit in the projected geographical model of <i>Gemeinschaft,</i> is the dictum that it centers on the home, "has its roots in family life and is based on land ownership."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  T&#x000F6;nnies's 1887 description of <i>Gemeinschaft</i> had become a founding tenet of German sociology by the turn of the century<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> ; it referenced a social structure that could easily be articulated to the image of an enduring rural English life which both grounded and helped to offset the cultural anxieties attending explosive urban growth within Great Britain. But the constitutive link made between rural stability, land ownership (or even landed sedentariness), and religious tradition disables this <i>volk</i> concept as an explanatory model for unlanded Romani culture within modern England, since Gypsies were held to be largely areligious, and, with a few notable exceptions, they eschewed land ownership.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  So that in spite of the long tradition of migratory work in English agricultural systems (within which temporary Gypsy-Traveller labor was a stable fixture), Gypsy culture was seen to deviate in materially and symbolically important ways from both the community-based emblem of rural England and the vocational traditions of agricultural employment. All of which is to say that Gypsy culture&#x02014;and especially Gypsy community, which could not be made to fit into existing or imagined sociological models&#x02014;exceeded the empirical categories through which England took stock of itself as a modern nation-state.
</p>

<p>
This "unmanageable excess"<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  held obvious attractions for modernists, who sought to create alternate communities in opposition to bourgeois models. Precisely because Gypsy communities were rooted neither in orthodox religion nor in bourgeois domesticity they instantiated a seemingly extra-modern alternative to the suffocating familial conrations against which so many modernists, from Lawrence to Marinetti, directed their polemic. At once organic and without a delimited territorial space, unrooted and yet hardly deracinated, devoid of written history and therefore in some sense a spoiler of the dialectic, and&#x02014;especially&#x02014;resistant (though certainly not immune) to the codifying forces of bureaucratic modernity, the Gypsy community held out to some few anti-bourgeois <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> the promise of a proximate counter-modernity: not an anti- or pre-modernity existing beyond modernity in some mythic or romantic dimension, but, rather, a counter-modernity, existing alongside, and thoroughly imbricated in, modernity.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

During the early years of modernism, images of Gypsy community were everywhere in the local and national press. David MacRitchie, a founding member of the Gypsy Lore Society, gets at the substance and tone of this dominant journalistic coverage in 1908: "The policeman, the social reformer, and the man of the school board, all have their eye on the Gypsy; and the best way of 'raising him to our level' is sapiently discussed on platforms and in the newspapers."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In fact, in many ways 1908 was the culminating year for increasingly invasive attempts at social control of what was variously called the "Gypsy Nuisance," the "Gypsy Problem," and the "Gypsy Menace."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  While explicitly corporeal forms of anti-Gypsy measures, including execution, flogging, and banishment/deportation had been largely phased out in England by around 1815, they were replaced by measures of social control that intensified in the 1870s.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In the following decade, spurred on by the efforts of the anti-Gypsy "reformer" George Smith (who wished to be known as "George Smith of Coalville," in order to emphasize his own impoverished working-class origins), concerted attempts were made to bring Gypsies firmly into the orbit of state regulation. "By travelling in vans, carts, and tents," Smith wrote in 1883, Gypsies "escape the school boards, sanitary officers, rent and rate collectors; and today they are&#x02014;unthinkingly, no doubt&#x02014;undermining all our social privileges, civil rights, and religious advantages, and will, if encouraged by us, bring decay to the roots."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  This type of appeal to the apparatuses of private intervention (mainly religious charity) and state regulation was taken up in a variety of legislative efforts that sought to extend the ambit of existing Acts: the Vagrancy Acts of 1822 and 1824, which outlawed and detailed penalties for fortune-telling and unaccountable wandering, were enlarged in the Pedlars Acts of 1871 and 1881, for example. The Turnpike Roads Act of 1822 and the Highway Act of 1835, prohibiting encampments along major roads, were effectively complemented by the Commons Act of 1876, which allowed local authorities to close commons to Gypsies. (<i>GT,</i> 189-92).
</p>

<p>
This latter species of legislation, which attempted to transfer surveillance and disciplinary powers to local governmental bodies, is of especial importance to an understanding of the asymptotic relations between Gypsy populations and <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> regulations in these years. David Mayall's richly detailed account of the problems besetting the Housing of the Working Classes Act (HWC) of 1885 provides an excellent example of this tangle. Previous efforts to control the habitus and mobility of Gypsy encampments were thwarted precisely by that mobility: by the time proceedings against Gypsies (for public nuisance or health dangers) had moved to the stage of enforcement, the groups typically would have already departed.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But the HWC Act established local jurisdiction over "moveable dwellings deemed overcrowded, nuisances or injurious to health" <i>and</i> it allowed district councils to create their own bye-laws for these ends. The mitigating provision was that local bye-laws had to be confirmed by the Local Government Board (or the Home Office, for London bye-laws), which tended to dampen both enthusiasm and efforts on the local level; still, by 1909, 211 sets of local bye-laws had been passed against Gypsies.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  And while enforcement of these 

<b></b>

laws remained difficult, the concrete threats that they posed to Gypsy populations frequently had the intended effect of moving the Gypsies along (<i>GT,</i> 166-67).
</p>

<p>
The HWC Act contained within it clauses that had been first outlined by George Smith in what he called his Moveable Dwellings Bill, which was introduced to Parliament in 1885 and ultimately blocked. Compulsory education for traveling children was the most urgent of the Bill's aims, though it also addressed the by-now familiar laundry list of related social concerns: sanitation, registration, tax collection, sex separation, and perceived indolence. Smith relentlessly followed up with versions of the Bill each year from 1886-89&#x02014;all with an eye to "redeeming the Gypsy and Van children from their sad condition," in his words (qtd. in <i>GP,</i> 112). But the powerful MP "'blockers' of our poor little nomads" were allies of the Liberty and Property Defense League, an anti-New Liberal group supported by the influential Showman's Guild, whose constituents, travelling performance groups, stood to be adversely affected by the legislation. Reintroduced again in 1908 (the year of Symons's brief, agitated essay) it was this time powerfully resisted by the Showman's Guild, who used it to "establish 'Gypsies' as their scapegoats" (<i>GP,</i> 121) by arguing that it would punish respectable show people for the crimes of anti-social Gypsies. Provisions for the compulsory education of Gypsy children came in through the Children's Act, passed in that same year. But the combined effects of the HWC Act and the Moveable Dwellings discussions had already begun to issue in a series of forcible, violent evictions of long-standing Gypsy encampments from, for example, Epping Forest in 1894, Black Patch in Birmingham between 1904 and 1905 (to make room for a recreation ground), and from South Shore, Blackpool between 1908 and 1910 (<i>GT,</i> 175-78). This latter group had been established for more than eighty years, and, according to a plaintive letter to the King written by a Gypsy on behalf of her community, regularly paid rent, rates, and taxes. "We are English gipsies," Mrs. Franklin wrote, "and we look to our King for justice."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
These and other evictions, and the local agitation leading up to them, were welded into national consciousness through local and national newspaper reports.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Even Symons's essay, though deficient as a piece of activist journalism, reflects an uncharacteristic awareness of the particularities of the Gypsy plight as a political event unfolding in a more general political plot.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In fact I would argue that the shift in representations of Gypsies during this period from hazy and inscrutable natural subjects to objects of a discourse of legislation, prosecution, and control had concretely reifying effects both for Gypsy populations and within British narrations of nationhood. Legislative discourse after 1870 specifically targeted Gypsies as rural itinerants who resisted education, hygiene, and recognizable forms of labor. In so doing, it further homogenized the re of the Gypsy as a national object even as it blurred the widely heterogeneous lives of British Gypsies. 
</p>

<p>
For, of course, all of these redactions were fictions. In the first place, and as David Mayall and Angus Fraser have emphasized, Gypsies in England in these years were both sedentary and mobile, rural and urban. Some practiced patterned forms of migration based loosely on agricultural cycles, some moved seasonally from rural encampments

<b></b>

in summer to urban encampments in winter. Some movement was necessitated by local harassment, some by the shifting or shrinking markets for the goods and services that they sold to sedentary populations, both rural and urban.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  All movement and cessation of movement&#x02014;whether temporary or permanent, whether around London (where lived "the largest number of Gypsy-travellers situated in a geographically limited area" [<i>GT,</i> 34]) or around towns or between villages&#x02014;ultimately stemmed from economic considerations, which were in turn largely determined by relations with settled society.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  And those relations red heavily in the pollution taboos shared variously by Romani, which guard against, among other things, pollution through specific forms of <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> contact. These taboos ensured a practice of purity hygiene that was largely unintelligible to the dominant culture.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Education, too, was controversial from both directions. Reformers from the missionary Quaker Hoyland to George Smith saw the regulated education of children as the only reliable way out of what might now be called the "cycle of poverty" ascribed to Gypsy populations; according to this way of thinking, the Gypsies' ignorance about ignorance prevented them from understanding both their own "poverty" and its cure. But of course this diagnostic approach, so characteristic of a social control discourse modeled on epidemiology, missed a much more fundamental and complex dynamic. In the first place, Gypsy children took their education from a variety of sources, principally the closely-knit family group and wider kinship networks, but also from local schools (as Mrs. Franklin's letter to the King suggests when she avers that "most of our children have been born, christened, and educated" at Blackpool). In this connection it should be noted that state educational projects were by no means uniformly welcomed by schoolteachers; according to George Smith's biographer, some educators "protested that it would be a great moral wrong to flood their schools [with] the contaminating influence of Gypsy children . . . the very scum of the earth" (qtd. In <i>GP,</i> 127). In the second place, the tradition of non-literacy in Gypsy culture has recently been explained as an active cultural practice, a specific form of resistance to the pressures of cultural assimilation (of the kind exerted by institutional state apparatuses, for example), rather than a passive deficit.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Whether or not this explanation which tends to valorize illiteracy<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  to an alarming degree, fully accounts for the benefits of literacy within economically and politically marginalized cultures, it nevertheless helps to illuminate a tradition of resistance which was also wholly unintelligible to a dominant culture intent on bringing literacy to the masses.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that the issues of mobility and labor practices bear special attention in the early modernist period. Mayall has suggested that the "<i>nature</i> of [Gypsy] work, more readily identifiable with pre-industrial than industrial formations" was the source of the dominant culture's hostility, and I would add that this problem is inseparable from the perceived problem of mobility, which was understood to exist in a stark and sometimes threatening opposition to industrial society (<i>GT,</i> 59). No matter that Gypsy mobility was always already encumbered by economic considerations and existed across a continuum that included varieties of sedentariness. The bottom line was that even the most concretely domiciled sedentariness among Gypsy groups rarely coincided 

<b></b>

with widespread cultural assimilation, which would have been marked by a majoritarian acceptance of, among other things, organized Christianity, wage labor, bureaucratic interpellation of and transparent practices of sociability. Gypsy mobility could not be categorized as a species of agricultural migrancy, nor indeed as any form of migrancy, which entails a fixed and regulated territorial trajectory; instead, the very flexibility of Gypsy mobility resembled a kind of deterritorialization that was produced moment-to-moment by local conditions. Nor did this movement, which inexorably brings to mind Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's discussions of nomadology, allow for an easy equation of Gypsy mobility with nomadism. 
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in spite of the seeming applicability of the concept of nomadic deterritorialization to Gypsy mobility, Deleuze and Guattari's meditations are, on the whole, unsuited to a discussion of this mobility. Situated in 1277, their "treatise on Nomadology" precedes the development of Western modernity, and hence the re of the modern nomad. The topos of their discussion is one of largely unpopulated and interminable deserts, oceans, and steppes. (It is much more difficult, but, not impossible, to imagine nomadic movement along turnpikes and under urban railroad arches.) More particular, the effortless agency accorded the nomad (who "occupies," "inhabits," "holds," "distributes himself in" space) is largely unavailable to the Gypsy, who must live in an increasingly reactive relation to settled, industrial society.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Deleuze and Guattari's (heroized) nomad, who is going, precisely, <i>nowhere,</i> is pitted on the one hand against the migrant, who is always going <i>somewhere,</i> from one point to another, along a "striated" or settled trajectory, and on the other against the sedentary, who is always already <i>somewhere.</i> I am suggesting that modern Gypsies cannot be assigned a stable place in this stable triad. 
</p>

<p>
Where Deleuze and Guattari may be of use here is in their observation of a constitutive antipathy of a developing State to unstructured nomadic movement within its margins, which, in their account, interferes with the State's pursuit of "large-scale projects, the constitution of surpluses, and the organization of the corresponding public functions" (<i>TP,</i> 358). And while it is too much to say that the modern British state apparatus was seriously aggrieved by the "Gypsy Problem"&#x02014;considering the miners' strikes, suffrage activism, and Home Rule agitation taking place in these same years&#x02014;it is nevertheless significant that the State's functions projected by Deleuze and Guattari were all refused <i>a priori</i> in the established practices of Gypsy populations. Surplus, especially, found no place in Gypsy economies, which operated on principles of barter, the recycling of goods through repair, the crafting of goods from immediately available and largely gleaned materials (such as willow, heather, and the like), and the rendering of services on an as-needed, local basis. Nor could Gypsy activity be aggregated into State-building projects, which in these years had begun to interpellate the poor <i>as</i> working-class by way of Liberal legislation addressing workers' rights, pensions, minimum wage, and industrial unemployment. Moreover, at a time when social harmony and cohesion were actively fostered as decoys for the alarming increase in poverty rates at the turn of the century, as well as for the weakening of empire after the Boer War, the specter of "the Gypsy" as recalcitrant Other became somewhat starker.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Attempts to colonize these internal Others, whether through missionary work or through coerced sedentarization, were, by any measure, unsuccessful. Whatever cultural anxiety attended these failures can be seen partly as an extension of the more general anxieties embedded in nationalist discourse with regard to alien groups: nationalism and nation-building must view non-assimilation as a problem since the nation depends for its coherence upon an appearance of shared (not to say unified) heritage and culture. The perceived resistance among Gypsy populations to the requirements of national citizenship could be read off the specious evidence of Gypsies' insular and unwritten traditions, which suggested a primary, unself-reflexive (and therefore unmodern) commitment to group law. A perhaps extreme example of the fantasy of Gypsies' extra-national loyalties can be found in Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> 1897, which has been read by contemporary critics as a gothic allegorization of, among other things, racial theory, reverse colonization, the Irish question, the invention of the homosexual, and degeneration.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  But I would suggest that Stoker's representation of the Szgany gypsies who "attach themselves" to Count Dracula is intended to be precisely <i>non</i>-allegorical.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Jonathan Harker's diary entry, which notes that "They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania" reflects not only the statistics presented in an 1890 census which counted 275,000 Gypsies living in the Hungarian territories<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> , but also points to a perceived intra-racial alliance among Gypsies everywhere. The scope of this doxa is immediately enlarged with Jonathan's observation that they "are almost outside all law. . . . They are fearless and without religion, save superstition." Jonathan drops letters (and a piece of gold) into the Szganies' courtyard encampment, hoping that they will post them and effect his escape from Dracula's castle; their leader "press[es the letters] to his heart and bow[s]" but betrays him immediately (<i>D,</i> 45). The Gypsies' loyalties lie with the vampire, not the English representative of enlightened modernity<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> ; and indeed, it is a Gypsy who stabs and kills the American Morris in the Szganies' final struggle to save their unholy master.
</p>

<p>
The undecideable loyalties and affiliations of groups who could not be assimilated to the modern project of nation-building comprised an important theme in another, more prominent coeval debate about racial difference, the Jewish Question. According to Amanda Anderson's penetrating account of the wide ranging intellectual debate about Jewish culture, "the Jewish race" was understood to manifest a recalcitrant separatist character that rendered it unequal to the tasks of modern citizenship, which required identifying oneself with humanity in general and the interests of the state in particular. . . . [T]he judgment that Jews were particularistic rather than universal, tradition-bound rather than modern, effectively wrote them out of the modern project."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  I would argue that in this and in many other respects, the arguments surrounding the Jewish Question were reflected in the construction of the "Gypsy Problem." Both groups were diasporic; both were deemed to follow the laws of insular culture rather than the civil laws of a self-reflexive polity; and both were seen to exist in a state of internal exile and to present drains on local resources and potential threats to national character. Indeed, the frequency with which the two groups are linked 

<b></b>

throughout the nineteenth century in casual comparisons or as mutually illuminating cases is quite striking, especially in view of the stark differences between them. The nineteenth-century narrative of Jewish diaspora, for example, is teleological in nature, depending upon centuries of written history, saturated with cultural memory and following a futural arc towards an end-point of collective settlement. By contrast, the (<i>gad&#x0017E;e</i>) narrative of Romani diaspora involves uncertain origins and an equally uncertain telos. Where Jewish law is based upon a strict codification of religious faith, the structures of Romani self-regulation&#x02014;most notably through anti-pollution laws&#x02014;cannot be understood as a derivation of religious dicta.

Nevertheless, the pairing of Jews and Gypsies as exceptionalist challenges to universalist principles of political philosophy occurs regularly, and it is interesting to note that it often takes the form of a binarism within anti-semitic discourse, according to which a romantic celebration of the "Gypsy" is propped on the denigration of the "Jew."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In this conration, for which I take as an (admittedly extreme) example Franz Liszt's <i>The Gipsy in Music</i>, Jews are seen to have prospered unethically, in spite of their hardships, through usury, obsequious accommodations, cowardly assimilation, vicious insularity. Liszt spends four early chapters in this spiteful vein, passing judgment on Jewish music (derivative), Jewish scholarship (anxious and overly prized), Jewish economic practices (predatory), and so forth, in order to dilate by comparison on the mystery of "Gypsy" endurance and the unaided genius of "Gypsy" music. The "Gypsies" have "consistently resisted all temptation to participate in the prosperity of the favoured nations," and unlike converted Jews never "ostentatiously deny their own [identities] . . . in order to partake of prosperity, vilely acquired."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
"Gypsy" music reflects this stark self-determination: it is, in Liszt's account, a literal transmission of natural beauty, a reflection of the unmediated relation between "Gypsies" and their rural environs.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Perhaps most crucially, "Gypsy" music is inseparable from the communities that create it: its eerie key changes and collaborative, spontaneous rhythmic patterns simply cannot be reproduced by the <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i>. For Liszt, "Gypsy" music is, like its musician channeler, <i>sui generis.</i>

The fascination of a <i>sui generic</i> "Gypsy culture" for modernists like Symons, D. H. Lawrence, and Augustus John, the latter of whom spent a considerable amount of time learning Romani dialects and camping with Romanichals in southern England, cannot be extrapolated into a general claim about a constitutive indebtedness of British modernism to "the Gypsy." Such an effort would in any case depend upon a speciously homogeneous understanding of both cultures. What may be teased out instead, as I have suggested, is the significance of the parallels between the counter-modern social formations understood by interested <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> to be intrinsic to "Gypsy culture" on the one hand and the sociological ideals underpinning modernist social formations on the other. What British modernism takes from "Gypsy culture," I would propose, can only be seen from a perspective that recognizes within modernism 

<b></b>

a painfully contradictory set of relations to modernity that seek some measure of palliation in flexible forms of sociability. Particularly disruptive for the modernist generation (especially in Britain) was the recognition that it was itself a product of the liberal traditions through which the projects of modernity were conveyed, which is to say that while modernism was always already a product of modernity, it struggled with, reacted to, and aimed to escape this tautological conundrum.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Sociability, or what the modernist sociologists called communality, provided one way of mediating the conundrum. The sheer variety of the forms of sociability connected to modernism helps to focus this point: the workshops, art centers, salons, moveable feasts, hostess parties, gallery groups, rhymers' clubs, house parties, pageants, pub crawls, cruising grounds, Thursday evenings, and tea room collectives in which modernists gathered were inseparable from the transmission and production of modernist aesthetics. The very flexibility of these social forms was in some sense engineered, or at least performed, as a challenge to what was, in the modernist imaginary, the fixed architecture of bourgeois associations. In the best of circumstances, such social formations could provide spaces of un-becoming (of the "self") and becoming (into otherness), and could themselves fluctuate into spaces of living art. It is no accident that impersonally intimate sites of sociability are featured so prominently in modernist fiction precisely <i>as</i> spaces of living art<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> ; indeed, this is the role assigned to sociability by Georg Simmel, who understood it to be an artistic practice through which kaleidoscopic forms were made and unmade from fragments of personalities in recombinant relations. Of great value to Simmel was the role that modern sociability played in mediating the excesses of instrumental rationalism. True sociability, in his view, could not be harnessed to expediency or acquisition, but was an end in itself, a source of frictionless pleasure.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The search for (and spontaneous creation of) alternative forms of sociability by modernists was, on this reading, a pursuit of a modality of art whose flexible dimensions prevented its social assimilation into the teleological projects of modernity. "Gypsy culture" offered a ready-to-hand example of this kind of minority form, especially for British modernists, whose national literary culture included, not incidentally, an abiding strand of nativism. What was seen by the dominant culture as an inscrutably archaic insularity could also be (and indeed was, correctly) interpreted as a surface dimensionality beyond which a shifting and variable sociability flourished. Gypsy groups shared a bond of protective self-differentiation from <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> culture even as they met with and departed from other Gypsy groups, linking up for carnivals and fairs, working in coalitions and small groups, and meeting on the roads and in the towns. The lure of this kind of sub-rosa sociability&#x02014;the frisson of a thriving world beyond the veil of <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> intelligibility&#x02014;exerted a strong pull on many modernists. In 1907 Arthur Ransome, a self-styled "Bohemian," writes with awe about a "gipsy poet," a quiet boy who strays into Ransome's London caf&#x000E9; group, produces a slim volume of strange, good poetry (written with "the real blood and spirit of the country"), is spoken to furtively in the streets "in an odd tongue," and disappears forever one night when, after drinking with his <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> friends, he slips off with a Gypsy couple who have subtly 

<b></b>

hailed him on Battersea Bridge.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Ransome's physiogamous method of reading "Gypsy" sociability, if you will, according to which the richness of its internal systems is read off of its subtle extrusions, can rightly be dismissed as another instance of romantic gypsophilia. Even so, it points to what I think was of interest to a number of modern-identified writers in these years, including Symons: the possibilities for forms of sociability issuing from encounters, movement, relationality, and contact, in heterotopic spaces that are, by definition, "outside."
</p>

<p>
The painter Augustus John, who was soon to become a well-known protagonist of "Gypsy culture," made unusual efforts to involve himself in the lives of Gypsies&#x02014;not as an ethnographer, chronicler, or philologist (though he did collect phrases in his efforts to master several dialects), but an affiliate of sorts, a fellow drinker, a sympathetic carouser, or a participatory guest of the camps. It is worth noting that he published very little about the considerable time he spent in Gypsy encampments, at first with his Romany Rye friend John Sampson, and then on his own. His biographer ascribes to John the usual thrills that such contact brought to the would-be insider: exhilaration, wonder, liberation, and so forth. But what is of interest to me may be found in John's autobiographical accounts of a seemingly endless series of chance encounters with Gypsies in "outside" (and often non-rural) spaces. One of the many encounters scattered casually throughout his memoir <i>Chiaroscuro,</i> occurs in an open square in Marseilles. John is sitting in a bar watching "the comings and goings of Spanish gypsies" when he sees a Coppersmith Rom in magnificent dress striding across the <i>place.</i> Addressing him in Romani, John makes his acquaintance, learns that he and his group are en route to Italy, shares a bottle of wine with him, is invited to the encampment (a group of "single-roomed huts"), dines, listens to music and dancing, stays the night, stays the week, and goes on his way.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Notably John's serial, casual encounters with Gypsies, many of which lead to intensive experiences of impersonal intimacy, bear a strong resemblance to the forms of sociability associated with cruising practices.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  It is probably too much to say that John is cruising Gypsies, and even the observation runs the risk of re-reifying a travelling Coppersmith family as non-agentic "Gypsies" (since it is unlikely that Gypsies are cruising John, or any other <i>Gad&#x0017E;e,</i> for that matter). But recent discussions of cruising have pointed to the central feature of impersonality as one which paradoxically sustains community even as it disavows bourgeois emphases on the "character" or "personality" that grounds modern possessive individualism. I make this connection, therefore, to suggest the value for modernists of an abstracted version of what we know as cruising's brand of ungrounded, unpredictable, anonymous, or at least impersonal, sociability. It offers a model for living art; moreover, it revalues the modern, fragmented identity lamented by Durkheim, and hovers beyond the bars of Weber's iron cage of rationalism.
</p>

<p>
A more direct account of this abstracted sociability occurs in D.H. Lawrence's modernist novella, <i>The Virgin and the Gipsy,</i> written in 1925, but published in 1930 upon his death.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  It is the usual Lawrentian story about the awakening of desire, the primacy of the body, the deathly grip of bourgeois community and religion, the magnetism of 

<b></b>

true masculinity. A doe-like virgin, Yvette, imprisoned in her father's stifling rectory by his oppressive family (which her own mother has deserted), comes to some kind of blood-consciousness after a series of brief encounters with a handsome, virile "Gypsy." She first happens upon him by chance in his secluded winter camp, where she and her friends agree to have their fortunes told by the "Gypsy's" wife. His impersonal, level gaze ignites a sexual spark in Yvette, which persists through the winter and is fanned a bit higher by a second chance encounter on the road ("VG," 236). Twice he visits the rectory to sell his beautiful hand-made brooms and copperware; once she revisits the camp for a trance-like meal at the fire ("VG," 236). This latter event is interrupted by a bubbly tourist, significantly, a "little Jewess" whose wealth (red as an enormous fur coat) encases and obscures her body, and the interruption diverts Yvette from what might have been a sexual consummation. Yvette's final encounter with the Gypsy is rather different: he and his family have just broken their winter camp and are traveling north when he realizes that Yvette and her rectory are in danger of being destroyed by the flood waters of a nearby ruptured dam. He reaches the rectory in time to save Yvette (though not, thankfully, her hated "fungoid" grandmother), bringing her to the top floor of the flooded house, taking off her clothes and rubbing her chilled body, and disappearing before she regains consciousness in the morning. Her suffocating bourgeois life, we understand, is forever changed.
</p>

<p>
The Gypsy plot of <i>The Virgin and the Gypsy</i> has either typically been dismissed as one more instance of condescending <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> romanticism, or overlooked by Lawrence scholars as simply another allotropic version of the author's "sexual awakening" plot devices. An exception to this trend is John Turner's reading, which takes seriously Lawrence's portrayal of economic and social relations between <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> and Gypsy in the story.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Yes, the "Gypsy" is arrestingly handsome, loose in his limbs, a master of horses, taciturn yet meaningful, potently sexual (he has "say, five" children, he tells Yvette), which is to say that he is always on the verge of stereotype. But Lawrence has supplied other details that anchor him in the striated world of modernity. One of the most striking of these, in my view, is the fact of his conscription and service in the war: "He had been through the war. He had been enslaved against his will" (<i>VG,</i> 236), as Lawrence puts it, and we learn that the experience nearly killed him in the form of pneumonia. To go "through the war," means, for Lawrence, to be broken on the rack of modernity<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup> : the Gypsy's "disillusion in hostility, which belongs to after the war"  is the psychic price exacted by modernity's irrational and relentless trajectory. And the Gypsy pays twice over: he is a Gypsy-"Tommy" , cannon fodder for a culture bent simultaneously on his allegorization and his disappearance.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The narrative delicately reveals his complex double-consciousness as outsider-Gypsy and as reluctant subject of modernity. His name&#x02014;Joe Boswell&#x02014;is given only in the penultimate line of the novella, at the end of a note he writes to Yvette after reading in the newspaper that she has survived the flood. This delayed disclosure, not only of his name but also of his literacy, and Yvette's surprise that "only then she realized that he had a name" , retroactively lights up her primitivist ignorance. She had imagined herself living in the Gypsy's camp: "Just to be where he was, that was to be at home. 

<b></b>

The caravans, the brats, the other women: everything was natural to her, her home, as if she had been born there" . But a Gypsy with a name, who reads the papers and writes letters, is not part of this fantasy, and thus Lawrence establishes that Yvette is too far "inside the pale"  to fully enter the Gypsies' complex world of sociability. Boswell himself suspects as much: he hews to his position "on an old, old warpath against such as herself"  even as he recognizes her struggle against <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> confinement. These thoughts are delivered through wisps of free indirect discourse, by means of which Lawrence frankly accords Boswell narrative subjectivity; at the same time it must be said that Lawrence does not presume to focalize the narrative through Boswell. He instead marks Boswell's "ever-unyielding outsideness" as always already riven by "the vast and gruesome clutch of our law" , <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> law. Such double-consciousness is constitutive of subjectivity in modernity, as modernists from Baudelaire to Du Bois will attest, and I would suggest that Lawrence's assignment of unstable but sovereign subjectivity to the Gypsy by means of this developed characterization should be read not as an example of exoticism but rather as an exploration of an exemplary model of modernist subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
There are other reasons to read the Gypsy plot from this angle. The Gypsy's craftsmanship, for example, and especially his sanctified relation to the objects of his craft, are portrayed as conduits of through which modern reification is resisted.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  More to my purposes, the story's triangulation of domestic sites, which pits the clean, essential, transient camp of the Gypsies against both the physically disgusting rectory and its mushroom-like inhabitants, and the "little Jewess's" faux-Bohemian (and terribly cluttered) domestic arrangements with her lover, helps to focus on the conditions of possibility for an alternative "smooth" sociality, as Deleuze would describe it, beyond the colonizing grasp of settled society and law. Though familial in structure, the Gypsy camp in this story displays a constitutive flexibility that Lawrence clearly admires but with which he assumes no easy familiarity. We never see the insides of the caravans, nor do we understand what is said among Gypsies. What we do see, I would suggest, is a portrait of alterity which recognizes the historical contingencies of its subjects.
</p>

<p>
More than this, Lawrence's novella points to the wider modernist problematic with which I began this essay. Like so much modernist work, the narrative imagines alternative social forms through which it explores and performs and even attempts to ameliorate modern consciousness in sociality. Here Romani sociality is rendered, however minimally, as a form that resists <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> (re)territorializing, in stark contrast to the popular nineteenth-century genre of Romany Rye texts which purport to lay bare the secret romantic core of "Gypsy" life. By making this comparison I do not mean to suggest that Lawrence's, or indeed any, modernist treatment of Romanies is more "legitimate" or less appropriative than non-modernist representations of "Gypsies." Instead I am calling attention to the socio-historical problematic that undergirds modernist representation. As the incommensurability between <i>gadzikane</i> and Romani cultures was increasingly elaborated and codified through the discourses of social control, British modernism took incommensurability itself as a site of aesthetic investigation. Whyndham Lewis's despotic individualism, Charlotte Mew's queer indirection, E.M. 

<b></b>

Forster's forced symbolism, and any number of other formal strategies yielded a modernism characterized precisely by its own alterity to alterity, its unwilling and unwitting and yet inevitable otherness to the otherness it pursued. Like consciousness itself, in which alterity is embedded, alterity cannot be directly rendered, as modernists well knew. But in the process of mapping strange social relations that resisted assimilation or transparent intelligibility, some modernists aimed for a point of intersection between alterity and sociality, somewhere off the grid of instrumental modernity. The struggles of Gypsies in Britain in the modern period form the conditions of possibility for this <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> modernism. Taking for an implicit model the recombinant and unsutured features of "Gypsy" and Gypsies' movement in modernity, <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> modernism pursues an infinitely receding and always-strange community.

Though the Bill had passed its second reading in the House of Lords at the time of Symons's intervention, it was eventually withdrawn. The Bill marked the culmination of multiple attempts to empower local county councils and authorities to regulate Traveller populations. The withdrawal of the Bill in 1908 occurred because certain of its clauses were duplicated in existing Acts or in Bills under discussion.

For outsider-describers writing about Romani peoples, lexical decisions are especially fraught. One preeminent Romani scholar, Ian Hancock, recommends that "Romani" be used to reference all groups of Romanies everywhere, since as he says "<i>all</i> groups use the adjective <i>Romani</i> to describe themselves" (<i>We are the Romani People</i> [Hertfordshire: University Hertfordshire Press, 2002] xx). (It should be noted that since Hancock hopes along with other activists to "instill a sense of historical unity among the different groups" [xxi], a single umbrella name is particularly useful for this kind of identarian project.) But Angus Fraser points out that "Romani" doesn't work particularly well in Britain, "because of the very considerable non-Romani element in the ancestry of the British Gypsy population and the long [overlapping] history of other travelling groups" (<i>The Gypsies</i> [Oxford: Blackwell, 1992] 7; hereafter abbreviated <i>TG</i>). He uses both "Gypsy" and "Romanichal" when referencing denizens of Britain (though not Ireland, for which he uses "Traveller"). Among other prominent scholars in the field, Thomas Acton uses "Gypsy" but grounds that usage with a substantial lexical discussion of eighteen different terms used to denote non-<i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> (<i>Gypsy politics and social change: The development of ethnic ideology and pressure politics among British Gypsies from Victorian reformism to Romany nationalism</i> [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974] 60-80); hereafter abbreviated <i>GP.</i> Judith Okley uses both "Gypsy" and "Traveller" (<i>The Traveller Gypsies</i> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press] 1983; hereafter abbreviated <i>TGG.</i>); Ken Lee uses "Romani" in "Orientalism and Gypsylorism" (<i>Social Analysis</i> 44.2 [November 2000] 129-56); and David Mayall uses both "Gypsy" and "Gypsy-traveller" (<i>GT</i>). I have used "Gypsy" in scarce quotes to denote the cultural constructions produced by <i>Gad&#x0017E;e,</i> and Gypsy or Romani, depending on context, to denote the Romani populations under discussion.

This untenable relation between the <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> construction of the "Gypsy" on the one hand, and the Romani people on the other has been discussed forcefully and at length by Acton (<i>passim, GP</i>), Mayall (especially Chapters 3 and 4, <i>GT</i>), George K.

Subjectivity in modernity is a vast philosophical problem that I do not aim to address here except in passing. Anthony J. Cascardi and Fredric Jameson&#x02014; to take but two current theorists of modernity who sustain a focus on subjectivity in late modernity&#x02014;both make use of Heidegger's use of Descartes to launch their own (quite different) arguments about modern subjectivity, and it therefore may be of some use to quote from each of them, in order to give some sense of the overall breadth of this discussion and its significance to modernism. Cascardi, for whom modernity and subjectivity are mutually constitutive, writes that in Heidegger's theory of representation (which "has since provided the accepted interpretation of the relationship between the subject and the modern age"), "the position of transcendental reflection as established in the philosophy of Descartes marks the transformation of the world from an all-embracing cosmos into an objective representation, picture, or 'view,'" and "the fact that the world becomes a picture at all is what defines subjectivity and distinguishes modernity as an historical paradigm" (<i>The Subject of Modernity</i> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992] 125). In a not-dissimilar vein, Jameson writes that, for Heidegger, modernity "is the word for a new arrangement of subject and object in a specific relationship of knowledge (and even domination)

<b></b>

towards each other: the object coming to be only as it is known or represented, the subject only as it becomes the locus and the vehicle for such representation"; however, for Jameson, since consciousness itself cannot be represented, nor can the "lived experience of subjectivity itself," "no theory of modernity in terms of subjectivity can be accepted" (<i>A Singular Modernity: Essay on the Ontology of the Present</i> [London: Verso, 2002] 52-3). Indeed, for this very reason, "Modernity is not a concept, but rather a narrative category" (<i>A Singular Modernity,</i> 94).

Fraser reports that of the numerous and variously brutal statutes passed against Romanies in England (beginning in 1530), the 1713 Act was the first to employ "Gypsy" instead of "Egyptian," a name which reflected early beliefs that Romanies had migrated from or through Egypt (<i>TG,</i> 130-42, especially 136).

Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century ethnographic accounts of visits in Gypsy-Traveller camps frequently refer to the perceived health and beauty of their members, though this is precisely the impression that George Smith of Coalville wishes to dispel in his relentless and verbose campaign for state sanitary regulations of encampments. In a paper from the late 1870s, for example, Smith writes about the sordid tents where "Gypsy" children "are born, live, and die; men, women, grown-up sons and daughters, lie huddled together in such a state as would shock the modesty of South African savages" (<i>Gipsy life: being an account of our gipsies and their children</i> [London: Haughton, 1880] 97-8). Thomas William Thompson's exhaustive "Affairs of Egypt, 1909" (a regular feature of the <i>Journal of Gypsy Lore Society,</i> in which press clippings related to Romanies are annually reviewed) provides casual and perhaps unintended evidence of Romani longevity by supplying the ages of Romanies brought before magistrates in courts, a surprising number of whom are octogenarian and older (<i>Journal of Gypsy Lore Society</i> NS 5.2 [October 1911] 113-34).

Okely has, since the early 1970s, argued that the Romani "have never been an isolate but are a group which is perpetually created in opposition to the dominant and surrounding societies which they inhabit and from which they are partly created. They both embrace continuing aspects of the surrounding Gorgio [non-Romani] society and invent or invert other aspects" ("Constructing Difference: Gypsies as 'Other'" <i>Anthropological Journal of European Cultures</i> 3.2 [1945] 55-73; hereafter abbreviated "CD". 62). It is worth noting that this non-racial view differs controversially from scholars of Romani history and culture (such as Fraser, Hancock, and Acton) who agree with nineteenth-century philologists that a "nucleus" group began their migration from northwestern India around 1000 AD.

One particularly noxious effect of the frustration generated by this clumsy mechanism was the High Court decision that owners of land where Gypsies camped were also liable for prosecution.

Georg Simmel's plangent meditation on "the stranger" has a pointed relevance for the overdetermined relations between Gypsy-Traveller cultures and settled society. The stranger, he writes, is "the person who comes today and stays tomorrow. He is, so to speak, the <i>potentia</i> wanderer: although he has not moved on, he has not quite overcome the freedom of coming and going . . . [H]is position [in relation to the dominant group] is determined, essentially, by the fact that he has not belonged to it from the beginning" ("The Stranger" <i>The Sociology of Georg Simmel.</i> trans. and ed. Kurt H. Wolff [ New York: The Free Press, 1950] 402). Like the Traveller groups living among but not within settled society, "strangers are not really conceived as individuals, but as strangers of a particular type" ("The Stranger," 407). And while it is significant that Simmel adduces the Jew as the best example of the stranger, I would suggest that his observation that the stranger "often receives the most surprising openness&#x02014;confidences that sometimes have the character of a confessional" could be applied to the intimate situation of Gypsy palmistry, within which the <i>gad&#x0017E;e</i> pays to be read.

A notable exception to this trend occurs in early criminology, which is often equally anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy. One example is Cesare Lombroso's notorious categorization of Jews and Gypsies, the latter of whom constitute "an entire race of criminals with all the passions and vices common to delinquent types: idleness, ignorance, impetuous fury, vanity, love of orgies, and ferocity. Murder is often committed for some trifling gain. The women are skilled thieves and train their children in dishonest practices. On the contrary, the percentage of crimes among Jews is always lower than that of the surrounding population; although there is a prevalence of certain specific forms of offences, often hereditary, such as fraud, forgery, libel, and chief of all, traffic in prostitution; murder is extremely rare" (Cesare Lombroso, <i>Criminal Man</i> [New York: Putnam, 1941] 140).

Nearly all theorists of drama from G. W. F. Hegel to the present assume that the advent of modernity increasingly renders classical forms of tragedy aesthetically moribund and politically irrelevant. According to this historicist view, the dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles survive, but only as historical artifacts within the culture museum of modernity. They may inspire modern thinkers and artists, but their forms, themes, and contexts cannot be revived except as an exercise in antiquarianism. Friedrich Nietzsche and W. B. Yeats provide striking, if rare instances of the critic and dramatist who refused to accept the historicist premises underlying the modern view of Attic tragedy. Nietzsche, no less than Hegel, regards the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles as antithetical to many of the values and institutions of European modernity, but for that very reason,

<b></b>

in his <i>The Birth of Tragedy,</i> he looks to the modern operas of Richard Wagner as both marking a genuine rebirth of the spirit of classical tragedy and heralding a revolutionary antimodern turn in the cultural history of modern Europe. Yeats, whose dramatic and critical works were influenced by Nietzsche, attempted, in no less hubristic a manner, to effect a rebirth of premodern, ritualized, and aristocratic tragedy within the apparently uncongenial confines of contemportary Irish politics. What Yeats found so attractive in Nietzsche was a shared hostility, even repugnance, to what both men considered the defining features of European modernity, and a common conviction that the forces of modernization might be resisted by bringing about a cultural rebirth of the spirit of ancient tragic drama. Yeats's drama and theatre criticism thus represent a sustained effort, a l&#x000E1; Nietzsche, to resist the notion that aristocratic tragedy and ritual theater are historically irrecoverable. 
</p>

<p>
Yeats saw his efforts to assist in the rebirth of ancient tragedy as an essential part of a militant cultural and political program to free modern Ireland from imperial British rule. Yeats's literary midwifery aimed to establish a free and independent Irish nation that would offer a counterweight to the forces of (English or British imperial) modernity. Though nationalism itself might be said to be a distinctively modern ideology, Yeats hoped to cultivate an independent Irish nation on nominally premodern or non-modern grounds. As the twentieth century wore on, however, Yeats grew increasingly disenchanted with the actual Irish Free State that emerged after 1921 and with the forms of Irish nationalism that predominated in the 1920s and 1930s. Oddly, his disappointment did not lead him to abandon, but rather to intensify his efforts to promote an "anachronistic" form of dramatic tragedy, which he imagined would serve as a kind of cultural counterweight to the increasingly modernizing Irish nation-state that came into existence after formal independence. Yeats's continuing efforts to create a ritualistic, heroic, cultic, and antidemocratic form of dramatic tragedy from 1916 onwards represented his vigorous attempt to cultivate an "alternative" form of Irish modernity that was as much at odds with the British imperialism (and English culture) as it was with the predominant and increasingly official strains of modern Irish nationalism of the 1920s and 1930s.
</p>

<p>
As a founding member of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899, and later a leading dramatist, co-director, manager, and polemicist for the Irish National Theatre Society (founded in 1902 and better known after 1904 as the Abbey Theatre), Yeats looked to an "ancient" form of tragic verse drama to play a leading, even decisive role in revivifying and remaking Irish national culture at a time when prospects for Irish Home Rule, to say nothing of Irish national independence, were bleak. But despite his dominant position in the Abbey Theatre in its early years, Yeats ultimately found that his own heroic verse tragedies were exceptional, rather than typical of the dramatic works favored by the National Theatre Society. In 1937, reflecting back on his early career as a dramatist for the Abbey, Yeats lamented, somewhat disingenuously: "my audience was for comedy&#x02014;for Synge, Lady Gregory, for O'Casey&#x02014;not for me. I was content, for I knew that comedy was the modern art."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  His disappointment with the direction of the Abbey had led him in 1910 to limit his direct involvement in its daily management.

<b></b>

From 1910 until the mid-1920s, Yeats largely abandoned the Abbey as the primary venue for his dramatic works. Turning to coterie or private theatre (often staged outside of Ireland), Yeats invented a distinctively avant-garde form of tragic drama that reflected his deepening discomfort with the direction of Irish political nationalism in particular, and (from 1922 onward) with the institutions of the Irish Free State in general.
</p>

<p>
If Yeats was ultimately unsuccessful in shaping the Irish national theater, to say nothing of the Irish Free State, according to his own Nietzschean vision, his attempt to found a new national culture on the basis of a tragic re-presentation of heroic Irish legends and myths nevertheless provides a revealing instance of how a modernist experiment in reviving the anachronistic forms of aristocratic tragedy could be intimately related to the twentieth-century political projects of anti-imperial struggle and state formation. Yeats's decades-long career as a vociferous exponent of a "conservative" nationalist cultural ideal (the term will prove less and less satisfactory in the course of this essay), gave birth not only to a radically avant-garde form of dramatic practice, but also to a surprisingly progressive and forward-looking cultural critique of the political dangers and cultural deformations of modern nationalism. Exemplifying many of the characteristic features of what Terry Eagleton has termed the "archaic avant-garde," Yeats's explicit rejection of dramatic realism, democratic aesthetics, and the tastes of the contemporary commercial theater, his seemingly vain endeavor to recuperate moribund forms of ritual theatre and aristocratic political tragedy, made possible not only many of the most celebrated examples of modern Irish drama, but also a series of prescient cultural interventions that resonate in unexpected ways with the most advanced postcolonial critiques of the nation-state.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

Yeats's indebtedness to Nietzsche is well documented and widely acknowledged. As Roy Foster has noted, Yeats would have been introduced to Nietzsche's thought at least as early as 1896 through the reviews and essays of Havelock Ellis and Arthur Symons.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Symons's essay, "Nietzsche and Tragedy," provided Yeats with a sympathetic review and synoptic description of the main lines of argument of <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> Here Yeats would have encountered for the first time Nietzsche's theses that Attic tragedy grew out of the Dionysian religious festivals, music, and ecstatic rituals of pagan Greece, that the flourishing of Greek tragedy depended on a productive if unsustainable opposition between the Apollinian and Dionysian forces in ancient Greek culture, that Greek tragedy had been undermined by the rationalism of Socrates and the dramatic realism of Euripides (both harbingers of modernity), and that the spirit of tragedy had been reborn in Wagnerian opera.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Even if he did not encounter Nietzsche's work directly (which seems unlikely) and merely relied upon a secondhand knowledge of Nietzsche's writings on classical Greek drama, Yeats's early critical reflections on theater, tragedy, myth, ritual, and the revival of Irish culture are nonetheless deeply indebted to <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> In his essay of 1900, "The Theatre," 

<b></b>

Yeats maintains that drama "began in ritual, and it cannot come to its greatness again without recalling words to their ancient sovereignty" (<i>EI,</i> 170). Yeats opposes the <i>modern</i> "theatre of commerce" to the "remote, spiritual, and ideal" "poetic drama" that he hopes will be staged by the newly founded Irish Literary Theatre (a forerunner of the Irish National Theatre Society) (<i>EI,</i> 166). For Yeats, Irish cultural conditions are particularly favorable for the revival of ritual theatre insofar as the audiences of Sophocles most nearly resemble those Irish country folk who eagerly listen "in Irish cabins to songs in Gaelic" "or to some tale of Oisin and his three hundred years in Tir n&#x000E1; nOg" (<i>EI,</i> 167). Yeats argues that a folk revival might be modeled on the cultural achievements of those urbane priests of the ancient world who transferred primitive pagan rites performed in a natural setting to "the hidden places of temples" in the city (<i>EI,</i> 168). For Yeats, it is only through ritualized drama that the natural emotions of pre-urbanized (and premodern) country people can once more be set free in the contemporary theater. 
</p>

<p>
In "Ireland and the Arts" , Yeats argues that the modern arts have failed. As the arts in ancient times were "almost inseparable from religion," those Irish artists who would revive them in the present age must conceive of themselves as a "priesthood of an almost forgotten faith" (<i>EI,</i> 203-4). There are two passions on which this new priesthood can found a religio-aesthetic renaissance: "love of the Unseen Life and love of country" (<i>EI,</i> 204). For Yeats the return of the Irish spirit entails a self-conscious recovery of the Celtic myths and heroic stories of Ireland such as those of Cuchulain, a recuperation not unlike that of Nordic myths in Wagnerian opera that Nietzsche praises as "a return to itself of the German spirit."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  If Bayreuth provides modern precedent for an Irish cultural revival, Yeats also looks back to classical Greece for inspiration. Contemporary political conditions in Ireland (such as imperial English rule) will only intensify the Irish "love of country," a passion shared by the ancient Greeks. Yeats's ambitions are at once revolutionary and retrograde, populist and antimodern: "I would have Ireland re-create the ancient arts, the arts as they were understood in Judaea, in India, in Scandinavia, in Greece and Rome, in every ancient land; as they were understood when they moved a whole people and not a few people who have grown up in a leisure class and made this understanding their business."(<i>EI,</i> 206). Suggestively, the ancient arts flourished in a number of countries&#x02014;Ireland, Judaea, and India&#x02014;currently under British imperial control.
</p>

<p>
It is an 1897 essay, "The Celtic Element in Literature," in which he expressly praises Wagner and the composer's use of the ancient myths of Scandinavia, that Yeats seems closest to the Nietzsche of <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> Yeats enthusiastically describes those ancient worshippers of nature whose "supreme ritual" was a "tumultuous dance among the hills or in the depths of the woods, where unearthly ecstasy fell upon the dancers, until they seemed the gods or the godlike beasts;" it is in these ecstatic rituals that the frenzied worshippers came "nearer to ancient chaos" (<i>EI,</i> 178). Whereas ancient peoples delighted in tales and myths that ended "in death," their modern counterparts respond to "tales that end in marriage bells" (<i>EI,</i> 182). Primitive rituals and ancient rites 

<b></b>

encouraged a popular love of tragedy, while modernity encourages only an all too common taste for comedy and domestic concord. It is therefore no accident that "all the august sorrowful persons of literature, Cassandra and Helen and Deirdre, and Lear and Tristan, have come out of legends and are indeed but the images of the primitive imagination" (<i>EI,</i> 182). Yeats thus looks to the popular Gaelic poetry of his day (a surviving legacy of ancient Ireland) and to the "fountain of Gaelic legends," those concerning Deirdre, Cuchulain, Emer, Grania and Diarmuid, and Oisin, to provide the "vivifying spirit" "of excess" that will make the arts and imagination of Ireland blossom once more (<i>EI,</i> 185-7). Yeats insists that Ireland's Celtic myths and Gaelic legends have a regenerative power not only for modern Anglo-Irish literature, but also for the whole of modern European literature. A return to ancient myth and ritual is the predictable "reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth century," and "the materialism of the nineteenth century" (<i>EI,</i> 187).
</p>

<p>
Yeats's serious commitment to an Irish national theater and to tragic verse drama, which began with the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899, and his composition of a series of critical polemics in favor of a return to ancient ritual, myth, legend, religion, and magic thus coincided with and was inspired by his introduction to Nietzsche's theory of tragedy. Both in his dramatic works and in his cultural criticism Yeats called for a simultaneous repudiation of modernity (which he understood to be characterized by rationalism, materialism, commercialism, science, mechanical philosophy, liberalism, secularism, and the rise of the middle class), and a rejection of British imperial rule (which was the engine by which modernity had reached Ireland). In the early days of the Abbey Theatre, Yeats took particular satisfaction in the fact that the anachronistic laws that required the theater to hold a patent granted by the English Parliament paradoxically freed it from <i>de jure</i> political censorship to which English theaters were subject: "we are better off so far as the law is concerned than we would be in England. . . . In England there is a Censor, who forbids you to take a subject from the Bible or from politics, or to picture public characters or certain moral situations which are the foundation of some of the greatest plays of the world . . . <i>Oedipus the King</i> is forbidden in London."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Yeats's polemic res Ireland as the potential home of ancient freedoms and classical tragedy as against the restrictive modern, conformist, puritanical, utilitarian, and middle-class commercial tastes of Edwardian England. Indeed, as early as 1904, and again in 1909, Yeats hoped to stage <i>Oedipus the King</i> at the Abbey as a political protest against British imperial authority.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Yeats envisioned a newly independent Irish nation that might constitute a radical political alternative to British modernity. Despite his current reputation as a mere "cultural reactionary," Yeats nonetheless also oddly anticipates those postcolonial intellectuals and artists who defend the rights of minority cultures against the homogenizing threat of economic globalization and cultural imperialism. In his hands the rebirth of tragedy promised to be at once a radically retrograde <i>and</i> a revolutionary nationalist cultural phenomenon.

The 1904 premiere of <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> which, along with Synge's <i>Riders to the Sea</i> and Lady Gregory's <i>Spreading the News,</i> inaugurated the Abbey Theatre as the new home of the Irish National Theatre Society, represents Yeats's first major realization of the theatrical project he advocated in 1901: getting "our [the Irish] Heroic Age into verse" (<i>E,</i> 78). The first of five verse dramas Yeats devoted to Cuchulain, the hero of the Ulster or Red Branch cycle of Irish poetic sagas, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> met with considerable public and critical acclaim. Not long after its premiere, Yeats wrote triumphantly in <i>Samhain,</i> the journal of the Irish National Theatre Society, "Ireland in our day has rediscovered the old heroic literature of Ireland, and she has rediscovered the imagination of the folk" (<i>E,</i> 183). In 1906, the same year that he significantly revised <i>On Baile's Strand</i> for a new Abbey production, Yeats contrasts the common literary culture of the premodern past when the arts "belonged to a whole people," with that of the modern era (<i>E,</i> 209). Implicit in Yeats's polemic is his questionable assumption that whereas predominantly oral premodern European cultures had been characterized by an organic social and artistic unity, and were accessible to the poor and the rich, the peasantry and the nobility alike, modern mass culture is increasingly fissured and vertically stratified. In Yeats's view, an isolated intellectual aristocracy, a leisured class, has in contemporary Europe, and especially in imperial Britain, cut itself off from the world of the folk. This stratification of tastes is an unfortunate development akin to that which Nietzsche criticized in Euripidean drama and late Hellenic culture as inimical to the tragic spirit of the earlier dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles: it is due to the distancing of an increasingly hypertrophied and intellectualized audience from the folk beliefs, primitive passions, and religious ceremonies that gave birth to Attic tragedy. Yeats lays the blame for this accelerating cultural disunity on the engines of modernity: new technologies, such as the printing press, and the spirit of commerce&#x02014;the dubious cultural "benefits" of imperial English rule (<i>E,</i> 203-9).
</p>

<p>
<i>On Baile's Strand</i> is Yeats's attempt to bridge the cultural divide that threatens contemporary Irish culture a result of the deleterious influence of <i>modern</i> English culture on native Irish traditions. A drama featuring chanted or "sung" dialogue and music, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> is a heroic tragedy written for the people, a play meant to recuperate for a contemporary Irish audience the lost unity of a nearly extinct Gaelic oral culture. And yet, as Yeats would have acknowledged, there is no simple turning back, no unmediated return to the heroic world of the Irish legends or to the oral culture of ancient Ireland before the coming of the English. Yeats's careful revisions of a printed and published text, his need for a modern Irish theatrical venue in Dublin, his reliance on sophisticated financial arrangements and licensing agreements to bring the Abbey Theatre into existence, even his dependence on the <i>English</i> language, as opposed to the Gaelic or "Irish" tongue as the basis of his dramatic art, all mark his first major heroic verse tragedy as ineluctably a product of modern material culture. Though ostensibly set during the "Irish Heroic Age" (the pre-Christian, Celtic epoch, traditionally held to correspond chronologically with the beginning of the Christian 

<b></b>

era outside of Ireland), the play enacts a tragic historical conflict between, on the one hand, an archaic and anarchic, premodern and "stateless" phase of Irish culture and, on the other, an increasingly centralized, regulated, and routinized form of political life, one that foreshadows the unappealing features of modernity in general, and the British imperium and the modern Irish nation-state in particular.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by Lady Gregory's famous English prose translation (or more properly redaction and free adaptation) of the Ulster cycle, <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i> , <i>On Baile's Strand</i> dramatizes a political struggle between Conchubar, King of Uladh, and Cuchulain, King of Muirthemne. The dramatic action initially turns on Cuchulain's reluctance to swear an oath to Conchubar, who claims the title of High King of Ireland for himself and his heirs. Cuchulain argues for a radical untrammeled form of personal freedom, one untempered by the rule of law and intrusive administrative oversight of a High King: "I'll not be bound / I'll dance or hunt, or quarrel or make love, / Wherever and whenever I've a mind to" (ll. 177-9).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  By contrast, Conchubar argues for the values of political unity, stability, and order, for peace and security: "I would leave / A strong and settled country to my children" (ll. 181-2). Cuchulain dismisses Conchubar's political vision of a centralized, safe, and domesticated Ireland in scathing terms: 
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

And I must be obedient in all things;

<p class="noIndent">
By contrast with the epic hero, whose romantic yearnings and lyrical celebration of individual liberty more nearly reflect Yeats's own artistic sensibility, Conchubar seems singularly prosaic and tediously legalistic. Nonetheless, Yeats endows the High King with sufficient rhetorical power to call to mind the rare worth of hard-fought Irish political unity, of the political benefits of binding all subjects to the rule of law, and above all, of the profound responsibilities incumbent on those would-be founders of a nation who would merit the gratitude of future generations in a free and independent Ireland. In proper Hegelian fashion, the play dramatizes a conflict between two ethically defensible, if politically incompatible, alternatives.
</p>

<p>
If we were tempted to see in Cuchulain simply the carefree spirit of the artist as against the doleful responsibilities of political life, it would be well to recall that Yeats told Joseph Holloway in April of 1905 that "he had Charles Stewart Parnell in his mind when he wrote <i>On Baile's Strand.</i>"<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Cuchulain must not be reduced to a merely "aesthetic" antagonist of Conchubar's prosaic version of political duty. Whatever his affinities for the ethos of "decadent" aestheticism, he is no less a political hero who emblematizes

<b></b>

an increasingly outmoded form of social life, one incompatible with the new administrative centralization championed by the High King. When Cuchulain describes a state of affairs in which he would be reduced to just another flabby councilman and "cattle-raising" king in the boardrooms of Emain Macha (the site of Conchubar's court), he prophetically foreshadows the sort of Ireland promised to its people by progressive English liberals such as Gladstone, (or later by de Valera): a country of domesticated middle-class merchants, shopkeepers, strong farmers, and law-abiding (and docile) citizens who looked unfavorably upon the amorous libertinism, social hauteur, and individual liberties characteristic of a Parnell (or a Cuchulain); a nation of respectable patriots who would happily put behind them the violent heroic struggle required to make Ireland an independent domain.
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain's tragic fate in <i>On Baile's Strand</i> follows as a direct consequence of his decision to accede to the demands of Conchubar and to swear an oath of allegiance to the High King. While an oath to a monarch might seem a quaint and highly artificial plot device drawn from the mists of Irish antiquity, the matter would have resonated for Yeats's "Edwardian" audience. In 1906 (the year in which Yeats revised <i>On Baile's Strand</i>) all Irish subjects were still bound by their allegiance to an English king (a matter of intense debate and a contributing cause of civil strife after 1921 because the citizens of the Irish Free State had to swear an oath to the British crown under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty); even radical Irish nationalists, such as Arthur Griffith, journalist, cofounder of the <i>Sinn F&#x000E9;in</i> party, and vocal critic of many of the Abbey Theatre's dramatic productions, had argued for a dual <i>monarchy</i> for Ireland, thereby lending a contemporary political significance to the matter of an oath of allegiance.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In any event, it is the exclusive and exacting terms of his oath to Conchubar that prove to be Cuchulain's undoing. Shortly after Cuchulain pledges his allegiance to the High King, he encounters an impetuous young warrior from Alba (Scotland) who has killed an Irish soldier guarding the coast against foreign intruders, and who challenges Cuchulain to ritual combat. Cuchulain demurs because he intuits that the young man is his own (illegitimate) son by Aoife, Queen of Alba. Conchubar insists that Cuchulain's oath binds him to t on the High King's behalf, against all enemies, both domestic and foreign. Despite Cuchulain's initial defiance of the King and his desire to befriend the young man, Conchubar ultimately persuades the hero that he has been bewitched, and prevails upon him to honor his oath. In a frenzy, Cuchulain slays the young man, only to discover, too late, that he has killed his only son and potential heir. Overcome with grief and incipient madness, Cuchulain seeks revenge on Conchubar, but succeeds only in rushing madly into the sea, where he vainly does battle with the waves until he is mastered by their violence.
</p>

<p>
In its day, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> was hailed as a modern tragic masterpiece of the new Irish National Theatre. Irish patriots such as Padraic Pearse, a poet and friend of Yeats, who would ultimately distinguish himself during the 1916 Easter Rebellion as commander in chief of the Irish Volunteers and president of the Provisional Irish Republic, adopted Cuchulain as a heroic symbol of Irish national identity. And yet, <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> despite its celebration of Cuchulain as the heroic symbol of an emergent Irish 

<b></b>

national identity, suggests that modern political independence will be achieved only at the cost of what is most inspiring and admirable in the "ancient" Irish character. Cuchulain's tragedy is that he must sacrifice what is most noble in himself, his aristocratic autonomy, for the sake of a homogenized national collective. In Nietzschean terms, the Apollinian hero and representative of the emergent "state" must be sacrificed to the Dionysian forces, here represented by Cuchulain's madness and by the waves themselves, which in Irish mythology, represent the divine and destructive powers of the sea god, Manann&#x000E1;n, and his daughter, Fand of the Sidhe.
</p>

<p>
There is tragic irony in the fact that Conchubar exaggerates the immediate threat to his realm from Aoife and Alba. By virtue of his libertinism and his ethos of individual freedom and aristocratic liberty, Cuchulain has established a material (and biological) basis for union with a foreign race. Cuchulain would forge an alliance with his illegitimate son, one based on personal preference, class affiliation (he is impressed by the young man's aristocratic bearing and noble speech), consanguinity, and a common disregard for the law, sovereign political authority, the geographic limits of "nations," and matters of state. Cuchulain represents an alternative form of Irish independence and of Irish culture that comes into tragic conflict with Conchubar's more modern, practical, and restrictive form of national identity: an archaic, aristocratic, and cosmopolitan conception of community. Moreover, Conchubar's political <i>conservatism</i> ironically serves only to subvert the order of his "government." He risks civil strife with one of his strongest and most loyal supporters, while fomenting a needless and bloody conflict between his newly unified kingdom (Ireland) and a foreign power (Alba), a nation with which his own people have occasionally enjoyed friendly and even intimate relations.
</p>

<p>
Alba&#x02014;Scotland&#x02014;was the land from which came many of those Anglo-Irish Protestant families who forcibly settled Ulster during the plantations of the seventeenth century. In Yeats's day, Scotland was regarded as a center of Protestant (and unionist) political sentiment. In terms of his divided personal and political allegiances, Yeats's Cuchulain is rather like his creator, who despite his impressive credentials as an Irish nationalist (he was a one time member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a Fenian organization devoted to attaining political independence through physical force) nevertheless spent much of his life happily living and working in imperial England. More generally, Cuchulain resembles those Anglo-Irish Protestants (Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, John Millington Synge, and Yeats), whose cultural, personal, and even political connections with a land ruled by another queen, Victoria, were frequently at odds with their support of greater political autonomy for Ireland. 
</p>

<p>
If Yeats relished the opportunity to defy British imperial authority, he was also concerned with the censoriousness of certain Irish nationalist and Roman Catholic intellectuals who yearned to exercise unofficial authority over the productions of the Irish National Theatre. The Anglophobic jeremiads of D. P. Moran, a leading journalist, author of <i>The Philosophy of Irish Ireland,</i> and outspoken advocate of a Gaelic (speaking) and Roman Catholic Irish nation, or the political chauvinism and economic protectionism

<b></b>

of Arthur Griffith and <i>Sinn F&#x000E9;in</i> (meaning "Ourselves Alone"), were notable instances of the competing exclusionary nationalist movements against which Yeats inveighed. In his 1903 essay, "An Irish National Theatre," Yeats argued strenuously against any form of nationalist or religious ideology that would restrict the artistic liberty of the Abbey Theatre. In language that might have been applied to the heroic ethos of Cuchulain in <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> Yeats maintains that (dramatic) literature "must take the responsibility of its power, and keep all its freedom"(<i>E,</i> 117). He defends the commitment of the Irish National Theatre to produce "foreign masterpieces" at the Abbey and the right of its dramatists to derive inspiration from foreign models, as against those who would restrict its fare to works of purely Irish origin and subject matter (<i>E,</i> 122).
</p>

<p>
The ultimate triumph of Yeats's <i>On Baile's Strand</i> depends on the paradoxical fact that Cuchulain epitomizes a heroic conception of the Irish national character by tragically resisting the political and cultural norms of the High King of Ireland and his court, rather than happily conforming to them. Cuchulain's insistence on personal liberty, his aristocratic disdain for mere security and stability, his singular attachment to the "non-political" activities of love, music, song, and dance, and, above all, his cosmopolitan, as opposed to an exclusionary and xenophobic, conception of patriotism and nationhood, all denote him as the exceptional Irish hero par excellence. And it is precisely this exceptional character that necessitates his tragic fate. Yeats's play thus dramatizes the tragic tension between the Apollinian and Dionysian elements present in Irish culture: the spirit of the nation as the exceptional political individual, the aristocratic patriot and rebel (Cuchulain or Parnell) versus the spirit of the nation as a transindividual collective of average Irishmen, of ordinary (middle-class) subjects who require the periodic sacrifice of the individual hero and political martyr to insure their security.
</p>

<p>
In the wake of the riots ignited by the premiere of Synge's <i>Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey in1907 (Moran and other nationalist intellectuals criticized the play for its alleged obscenity, its lack of patriotism, its inaccurate, irreligious, and demeaning portrait of the Irish people), Yeats defended the nationalist credentials of the Irish National Theatre Society. He noted (with some satisfaction) that nationalists and unionists alike had attacked the Abbey. But his most energetic polemic consisted in defining the artist as a heroic re who finds himself tragically in conflict with his own people, his own nation. Yeats insisted that the truly extraordinary and representative artist defines the national character of his people in the face of popular animosity and public controversy (<i>E,</i> 237-9). Yeats's version of the Nietzschean culture-hero bears a striking resemblance to his Cuchulain of <i>On Baile's Strand.</i> Both the greatest artist and greatest epic hero of the Irish nation are inevitably (if only temporarily) the enemies of the people; their greatest success consists in their tragic struggle to define the nation against the popular will, to impose a form upon the nation's identity. For Yeats, the tragic conflict, at once Hegelian and Nietzschean, between hero and people ennobles and destroys the singular individual who ultimately gives shape to the national character; this tragic agon threatens to subvert even as it saves the community, which requires the sacrifice of the hero that paradoxically defines the nation's identity.

In April of 1916, a mere three weeks after T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound attended the premiere in the drawing room of Lady Cunard's London home of Yeats's <i>At the Hawk's Well,</i> a play inspired by Japanese Noh drama featuring Cuchulain, Padraic Pearse stood before the General Post Office in Dublin where he read aloud the Proclamation of the Irish Republic to the Irish people. That Yeats should have achieved a formal and generic breakthrough in the modern English-language theater at almost the exact moment as his friend and fellow poet, Pearse, played a leading role in mounting the Easter 1916 rising, invites an investigation into the relationship between Yeatsian avant-garde drama and the anticolonial struggle in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Whereas, the brilliance of Yeats's poetry after 1914 does not chiefly depend upon its formal innovation and technical innovation, Yeats's dramas of the same period are radically experimental works that struck even Beckett as revolutionary. In his first series of so-called "dance plays," which includes <i>At the Hawk's Well</i> , <i>The Dreaming of the Bones</i> , and <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> , Yeats employed masks for some actors, highly stylized face makeup for others (so that their faces might resemble masks); minimalist and often discordant music (often relying upon only drum, gong, flute, and zither); a virtually empty stage with abstract or symbolic non-naturalistic props; the absence of a curtain to mark scene changes; nonspeaking parts for dancers; compact and economical physical gestures, as well as dance movements mimicking those of "marionettes" or Bunraku puppets; and highly stylized rhymed and blank-verse spoken, sung, or chanted as the scene demanded. Yeats's collaborations with an impressive array of contemporary artists enhanced the high modernist texture of these plays. Among those who made particularly notable contributions to their staging over two decades were the Japanese actor, Michio Ito, who was trained in Noh drama, Ninette de Valois, who described her choreography as a form of "abstract expressionism," the Dutch sculptor Hildo van Krop, who provided a famous set of full-head masks for the players, George Antheil, who composed music that Yeats praised as "heroic and barbaric and strange," and Edmund Dulac, who designed masks, costumes, and wrote the musical score for the first private performance of <i>At the Hawk's Well.</i><sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Significantly, Yeats's turn to high modernist theatrical experimentation did not signal his abandonment of tragedy, nor of the Celtic myths, nationalist histories, and folk materials that had characterized his earlier plays for the Irish National Theatre. <i>At the Hawk's Well</i> and <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> are the third and fourth of Yeats's five plays to make use of the Ulster cycle, and both feature Cuchulain as their protagonist. But if Yeats once again relies on Irish mythic and legendary materials, his avant-garde dance plays signal a new and decisive development in his conception of tragic theater and its cultural and political function. Explicitly cultivating a small private coterie audience, Yeats reconceives of the theatre as occupying a ritual space that is sometimes inside, sometimes outside the body politic, but in any case one that no longer conforms to the "traditional" dimensions of an Irish <i>national</i> theatre. Yeats intended his 

<b></b>

avant-garde theater to be the center of an aristocratic religio-aesthetic cult; its intricate ceremonies and refined theatrical mysteries will enact a tragic spectacle, but at a critical remove from the public space of an emergent Irish nation. Rather than <i>directly</i> provide the ritual basis of a revivified Irish culture, this new dramatic cult will maintain a more mediated, distanced, if still significant symbolic relationship with the emergent "postcolonial" nation-state. Yeats's theatrical cult will project an alternative vision of community, one knowingly at odds with the actual "state" of the Irish nation and with modernity more generally. Yeats thus seems to embrace that very thing, the mystery cult, which Nietzsche had argued both preceded and followed (in a late decadent form) the historical apex of Attic tragedy.
</p>

<p>
In April of 1916, in one of his most famous essays of drama criticism, "Certain Noble Plays of Japan," Yeats described his revolutionary conception for a new form of drama: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am writing with my imagination stirred by a visit to the studio of Mr. Dulac . . . I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who, wearing this noble, half-Greek, half-Asiatic face, will appear perhaps like an image seen in reverie by some Orphic worshipper . . . I have written a little play [<i>The Hawk's Well</i>] that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price. There will be no scenery, for three musicians, whose seeming sunburned faces will, I hope, suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams, can describe place and weather, and at moments action and accompany it all by drum and gong or flute and dulcimer. Instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sitting-room, the music, the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in pantomimic dance.
<p class="blockquote">
In fact, with the help of Japanese plays 'translated by Ernest Fenollosa and finished by Ezra Pound,' I have invented a form of drama, distinguished, indirect, and symbolic, and having no need of mob or Press to pay its way&#x02014;an aristocratic form. When this play and its performance run as smoothly as my skill can make them, I shall hope to write another of the same sort and so complete a dramatic celebration of the life of Cuchulain planned long ago.

<p>
This passage suggests both continuities and divergences in Yeats's long-contemplated cycle of Cuchulain plays. Yeats has apparently abandoned the very notion of a public national theater. For what could be less in keeping with his previous goals for the Irish National Theatre than a private performance before a cosmopolitan group of international artists and well-to-do patrons of the arts staged in the drawing room of a wealthy English aristocrat? Even in the early years of the Irish Literary Theatre, Yeats had defined the dramatic art of a new priestly caste <i>in contradistinction</i> to what he derisively referred to as "the orthodoxy of the commercial theater" unfortunately imported into Ireland from its financial and political overlord, England (<i>E,</i> 101; 81). But even as he opposed commercial middle-class Victorian tastes, Yeats championed a "People's Theatre" for Ireland (<i>E,</i> 244). In his early articles for the National Theatre Society, Yeats specifically warned against "plays about drawing-rooms and written for 

<b></b>

the middle-classes of great cities, for the classes who live in drawing rooms;" moreover, he insisted on the "imitation of nothing English" (<i>E,</i> 97). However, by 1919, Yeats felt that his early hopes for a national theater had met with "discouragement and a defeat;" the People's Theatre that he, Lady Gregory, and Synge had envisioned had proved ineffectual (<i>E,</i> 250-3). Their attempts to meld Irish folklife with heroic nationalist feeling had failed; "the modern world" had proved "more powerful than any propaganda" (<i>E,</i> 253). To be sure, Yeats's characterization of this failure is self-serving, and in the wake of the 1907 Abbey riots over <i>The Playboy of the Western World,</i> freighted with his increasingly intense antidemocratic convictions. More particularly, his (as it proved, temporary) abandonment of the Irish National Theatre, suggests that his own distinctive brand of nationalism had failed to carry the day against its more popular Irish competitors, versions of Irish nationalism with deeper roots in the actual modern Irish Catholic populace, as opposed to the ancient "folk" Yeats had imagined. 
</p>

<p>
Having failed to shape the Irish people according to his own heroic and nationalistic ideals, Yeats predictably turned his back on the very notion of a popular theatre: "I want to create for myself an unpopular theatre and an audience like a secret society where admission is by favor and never to many" (<i>E,</i> 254). Yeats blames the degraded popular tastes of Ireland on England's colonization and subsequent democratization of his native country: "Ireland has suffered more than England from democracy, for since the Wild Geese fled who might have grown to be leaders in manner and in taste, she has had but political leaders. . . . I seek, not a theatre but the theatre's anti-self."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Yeats's notion of the "theatre's anti-self" was the recuperation of a ritualized "aristocratic" form of drama that was at once <i>premodern</i> and <i>non-Western.</i> It may surprise us that the outlines of an avant-garde cultural project aimed at resisting the encroachments of modernity, counterbalancing a strong bias in favor of Western cultural values, transgressing the artistic and cultural tastes of the bourgeoisie, challenging the religious prejudices of a pious middle class, subverting a commercial and capitalist ethos, and envisioned by an artist with impressive anti-imperialist credentials should take such a politically disturbing and antiprogressive form. But such is the nature of Yeats's revolutionary conception of drama.
</p>

<p>
In "Certain Noble Plays of Japan" Yeats provides a counter-imaginary to the popular theater of Ireland prior to the Easter Rebellion: "Noh was made a necessary part of official ceremonies at [the Shogun's court] at Kioto, and young nobles and princes, forbidden to attend the popular theatre, in Japan as elsewhere a place of mimicry and naturalism, were encouraged to witness and perform in spectacles where speech, music, song, and dance created an image of nobility and strange beauty" (<i>EI,</i> 229). Not withstanding Yeats's preference for an antipopular, nonrealistic, aristocratic dramatic form, his yearning for an aesthetic rootedness in folkways abides. The "god, goddess, or ghost" that often appears at a crucial juncture in Noh drama reminds Yeats "at times of our own Irish legends and beliefs, which, once it may be, differed little from those of the Shinto worshipper. . . These Japanese poets, too, feel for tomb and wood the emotion, the sense of awe that our own Gaelic-speaking country people will sometimes show when you speak to them of Castle Hackett or some holy well" (<i>EI,</i> 232). And 

<b></b>

despite its formal derivation from the exotic dramatic traditions of Tokugawa Japan and the necessity of first staging it in the alien environment of a London drawing room, his new form of ritual theatre, Yeats hopes, might yet be naturalized in the Irish landscape at some future date: "For some weeks now I have been elaborating my play in London where alone I can find the help I need . . . yet it pleases me to think that I am working for my own country. Perhaps some day a play in the form I am adapting for European purposes may excite once more, whether in Gaelic or in English, under the slope of Slieve-na-mon or Croagh Patrick, ancient memories" (<i>EI,</i> 236).
</p>

<p>
In his quest for a ritual theatre at home in the Irish natural landscape, one that might serve his country, Yeats reinvents a form of drama in which the distinctions among political, aesthetic, and religious practices are collapsed in ceremonies of the elite court or the mystery cult. Yeats remarks, with evident enthusiasm, "these [Noh] plays arose in an age of continual war and became a part of the education of soldiers. These soldiers, whose natures had as much of Walter Pater as of Achilles, combined with Buddhist priests and women to elaborate life in a ceremony, the playing of football, the drinking of tea, and all great events of State, becoming a ritual" (<i>EI,</i> 235). The convergence of Irish folk beliefs and Shinto religious rituals is significant for Yeats, not least because Celtic and Shinto religious traditions are premodern and non-Christian. A theatre based on non-Christian rituals and premodern (pre-Reformation) ceremonies would, at least theoretically, be free from the sectarian religious rancor between Irish Catholics and Anglo-Irish Protestants that plagued the Irish National Theatre Society; a dramatic movement founded by an elite group of Anglo-Irish Protestants for a national citizenry that was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. But if Yeats fancied that his revitalized and Celticized Noh theatre might suppress certain forms of Hibernian sectarian conflict, the plays he wrote for this new cultic theatre were, no less than those he had written for the Abbey, rooted in a fundamentally tragic conception of Irish political history.

By the beginning of April 1916, when Yeats undertook his first crucial steps in his avant-garde theatrical revolution, his interest in <i>political</i> drama seemed on the wane. However, the events of Easter week changed utterly his artistic ambitions, and once more imparted to his subsequent dance plays the urgency and power of political tragedy. Yeats was taken aback by the fact that he, an avowedly nationalist Irish poet, had been in England enjoying the comforts of Sir William Rothenstein's Gloucestershire estate while his fellow Irish poets (Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh) had sacrificed their lives as leaders of the Rising in Dublin.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  It was in his third attempt at the avant-garde form of the tragic "dance play," <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer,</i> that Yeats found his most stage-worthy vehicle for representing, however indirectly and allegorically, the changed political conditions of revolutionary Ireland. Written at the end of 1917 and the beginning of 1918 (for private production), first published in 1919, originally performed in a public theater in Amsterdam in 1922, subsequently produced at the Abbey 

<b></b>

in 1926, and later revived there in 1929 under Yeats's supervision in a substantially revised prose version, <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> marks Yeats's attempt to link retrospectively his Cuchulain plays in a logical narrative sequence. Whereas Yeats had kept relatively close to the Irish source material for his earlier three Cuchulain plays (<i>On Baile's Strand, The Green Helmet,</i> and <i>At the Hawk's Well</i>), in <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> he freely adapts the Irish sagas for his own purposes. In this play, Cuchulain has apparently expired as a consequence of his t with the sea at the close of <i>On Baile's Strand.</i> Having once been the active and undaunted protagonist of Yeats's earlier Cuchulain plays, the Irish national hero now lingers helplessly between the world of the living and the dead. Why, we may ask, in the immediate aftermath of the 1916 Rising, at the historical moment when the endlessly deferred goal of Irish nationhood seemed finally at hand, does Yeats represent Cuchulain as a vague specter? Why should Yeats's heroic representative of Irish national identity suddenly seem a less substantial, less worldly, less politically potent re in 1919 than when he first graced the stage of the Abbey in 1904? Surely it is ironic that when <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> was published in January of 1919 the Irish War of Independence was beginning, and that by the time Cuchulain returned in his grave clothes to the Abbey in 1926 the Irish Free State had been in existence for four years.
</p>

<p>
The dramatic crux of <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> concerns the tragic choice that Emer, Cuchulain's wife, must make. To resuscitate Cuchulain, and bring his ghost back from the realm of the dead, Emer must renounce before Bricriu of the Sidhe any claim to her husband's love. So that she may break the spell that the otherworldly Woman of the Sidhe (Fand) has cast upon the Ghost of Cuchulain (who is not the same character as Bricriu&#x02014;who is called the re of Cuchulain), Emer relinquishes all claims on the hero's affection, surrendering first place in his heart to her earthly rival, Cuchulain's young mistress, Eithne Ingube, who has failed to revive the seemingly dead hero. I would suggest that by 1918, when Yeats completed the first version of the play, and had refined his revolutionary conception of an "aristocratic" cultic theatre, at a time when he had for many years ceased to be either at the center of Irish nationalist politics and had been living for all intents and purposes in his adopted country, England, he has come to understand that his powers to summon up an Irish national identity out of his imagination, to impose that vision by virtue of his creative will on the people of Ireland, to define in real terms the political culture of a new and independent Irish state, has ebbed away. He for the first time acknowledges that he must forgo his heroic or aristocratic vision for the Irish nation. In terms of the dramatic action of the play, for Cuchulain to be revived as a representative of the Irish nation, his beloved Emer must give him up to a new generation of suitors&#x02014;younger, more vibrant, less reflective, more materially interested, less spiritually elevated, better attuned to the realities and demands of (implicitly modern) political existence. That is to say, in order to preserve Cuchulain as a national symbol, Yeats must, like Emer, give him up to the young nationalists who have been his rivals, who have "stolen" the affections of the nation from him. Once more the Nietzschean formula seems pertinent: the Yeatsian dramatic cult serves the nation by performing the sacrifice of 

<b></b>

its own heroic demigod. The god must die in order to be reborn; the cult must will the destruction of its own sacred re in order that he might be transformed into a nationalist icon that serves the "mundane" aims of modern Irish politics. 
</p>

<p>
In 1918, Yeats's position vis &#x000E0; vis the emergent Irish nation was not quite so desperate as <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> might suggest or as the dramatist might have feared. From 1922 until 1929 Yeats served in the Irish Senate, and having won the Nobel Prize in 1923, he could legitimately claim to wield cultural influence in the Ireland of the 1920s and 1930s. But it is characteristic of Yeats's senatorial speeches that he generally sounds like any another late nineteenth-century liberal politician and not the ferociously nationalistic and antimodern artist and critic he was during the early years of the Irish National Theatre Society. Nevertheless, <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> seems cannily accurate in anticipating the increasingly insurmountable divide between a Yeatsian ideal for an Irish national culture and the actual "postcolonial" nation-state that emerged in the 1920s and the 1930s. The poignancy of Cuchulain and Emer's fate issues from the tragic choices they both make. If Emer must give up Cuchulain as her own, Cuchulain must abandon his pursuit of the ideal hawk-woman, the otherworldly woman of the Sidhe, for whom he has yearned since the days of his youth. In the original 1919 version of the play, the Ghost of Cuchulain finally turns his back on the Woman of the Sidhe in favor of Emer. But as he returns to the contemporary world of the living he (unwillingly) forgets both Fand and Emer (and his love for them); he awakens in the arms of his youthful if superficial mistress, Eithne Inguba (who herself remains oblivious to the otherworldly tragedy enacted before the eyes of Emer and the audience).<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Cuchulain's heroic stature is accordingly diminished. He settles for a "real life" mistress, young and attractive, but also vain, ignorant, silly, and possessing an unwarranted faith in her own powers and talents, rather than pursuing an ideal relationship that transcends the confines of the mundane domestic world. <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> thus points to Yeats's recognition that in achieving a laudable worldly goal&#x02014;bringing Cuchulain back to life, achieving a real measure of political independence for Ireland&#x02014;certain ideal poetic, aristocratic, and heroic possibilities must be foreclosed. However much Yeats once contributed to the cultural construction of a national ideal as a poet and dramatist in the early days of the Irish National Theater Society, the political realization of that ideal requires, at least in the dramatic economy of the play, that the one who has yearned longest and most passionately for its instantiation, will in the end, feel alienated and cast aside. Just as the reborn Cuchulain is only a diminished version of his former self, so too the national ideal is a lesser thing for having been embodied. What has been lost in the act of incarnation is the freedom and poetic possibilities of a noble, if archaic and therefore unachievable, form of cultural and national identity.

In the twilight of life, Yeats returned one last time to dramatize the re of Cuchulain. At the time of his death in 1939, Yeats left completed a final "Noh play on 

<b></b>

the death of Cuchulain."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Not produced until 1949, and then not by the Abbey, <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> is a postmodern work <i>avant la lettre;</i> like Beckett's plays, it self-consciously hybridizes theatrical styles, modes, and genres.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  It is a peculiarly self-reflective and intertextual drama that comments upon Yeats's earlier Cuchulain plays and on the political uses which the Irish Free State had made of the Cuchulain myth in the 1930s. But if Yeats anticipates postmodern theatre, he also achieves something of the tragic atmosphere and intensity of his earlier plays. Like the last work of Sophocles, <i>Oedipus at Colonus,</i> which Yeats adapted for the Abbey Theatre in 1927, <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> dramatizes the apotheosis of the tragic hero, who willingly resigns himself to death and transration. It fittingly concludes in the present day  with the literal monumentalization of Cuchulain as <i>the</i> heroic political symbol of the modern Irish nation. In many respects, Yeats's final play recapitulates and reworks the antimodern theories of tragedy that he developed forty years before under Nietzsche's influence. It stages the ritual sacrifice of the Apollinian hero, executed by a wretched representative of a degraded folk, an old beggarly blind man and the dramatic double of Conchubar from <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> who now returns to slit the dying Cuchulain's throat for a mere dozen pennies. As in a Dionysian rite, the Irish Goddess of War, the Morrigu, directs the slaughter of Cuchulain and ceremonially offers his severed head to Emer, who concludes the play with a ritual dance in praise of the sanctified hero. 
</p>

<p>
If Yeats offers a final and remarkably literal reenactment of the Dionysian ritual, he shockingly frames his cultic tragedy with two "modern" scenes. The play opens with an Old Man, who resembles the aged Yeats, inveighing against his audience. He rages against the "vile age" in which he lives, describes himself as "out of fashion and out of date like the antiquated romantic stuff the thing [the play] is made of," and announces that he will produce a drama called <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> for a small select audience who know Homer and the "old epics and Mr. Yeats' plays about them." He emphatically rejects a modern mass audience comprised of "people educating themselves out of the book societies and the like, sciolists, pickpockets and opinionated bitches." He concludes his diatribe against modernity by cursing his audience and spitting in disgust before them (ll. a-mm). This Brechtian or Beckettian introductory scene is structurally complemented by a concluding scene in which a ragged Irish Street-Singer of the late 1930s performs a song "the harlot sang to the beggar-man" (l. 196). Surprisingly, out of the mouth of the urban folk of the present day come verses celebrating Cuchulain:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p>
In the final words of his dramatic career, Yeats calls to mind the fact that in 1935 the Irish government erected a bronze statue of the dying Cuchulain, designed by Yeats's friend, the sculptor Oliver Sheppard, in the General Post Office in Dublin, former headquarters of the Irish rebels during the 1916 Rising, site of some of the fiercest ting during Easter week, and a national landmark sanctified by the blood of Irish political martyrs. The mystery revealed in these final ironic verses is that it is Yeats's Cuchulain who stood with Pearse and Connolly in the GPO; it is Yeats himself who "thought Cuchulain till it seemed / He stood where they had stood." Paradoxically, the Yeatsian cult of Cuchulain has triumphed in the end, or at any rate, Yeats has succeeded in reappropriating the political and nationalist symbols of the Irish Free State into his own heterodox, anachronistic, and ironized form of Irish cultural nationalism. Sheppard's statue attests not only to the sacrifice of the political martyrs of 1916, who first proclaimed the Irish nation, but also to the fact that Yeats's tragic hero has come to be officially acknowledged by the Irish government as the very symbol and abiding spirit of the Irish Free State. Yeats, the Irish tragedian who had rejected the modern Irish nation-state in favor of the ancient cult, because the Irish folk refused to conform to his untimely antimodern and antidemocratic ideal of Irish culture, paradoxically has become the father of <i>modern</i> Ireland. The Yeatsian rebirth of tragedy brings forth, in the end, the spirit of postmodern irony.

Although critics have tried parsing Lawrence's philosophical claims, turning them into coherent propositions, his fiction not only thwarts these efforts but renders them futile, even obsolete. The four protagonists in <i>Women in Love</i> can't decide, for instance, whether the apocalyptic scenarios plaguing them herald their extinction or promise tentative forms of renewal. Coupled with Lawrence's episodic and repetitious style, their rancorous exchanges yield only fleeting clarity. Viewed overall, the novel appears contradictory, the characters flailing as they try to specify what they think and want. In themselves worth studying, these effects can mask the novel's best points about personal and impersonal forms of violence.
</p>

<p>
Completed in 1916 at the height of World War I, <i>Women in Love</i> shares with near-contemporaneous works by Saki (H. H. Munro) and Wyndham Lewis an acute fascination with its protagonists' specific and inchoate hatreds, as well as with humanity's extinction. Far from protecting us from such enmity, these works 

<b></b>

almost recklessly embrace it, insisting, as Rupert Birkin does in Lawrence's novel: "What people want is hate&#x02014;hate and nothing but hate."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Turning such arguments against jingoism and toward an almost ethical relation to other people, Birkin adds that profound disaffection with humanity and a willingness to renounce the world display intellectual honesty and even moral courage. "People don't really matter," he tells Mrs. Crich in the second chapter, "It would be much better if they were just wiped out. Essentially, they don't exist, they aren't there" (<i>WL,</i> 73).
</p>

<p>
While domestic rancor, sexual strife, and interpersonal contempt partly account for this animosity, the novel's inchoate forms of hatred end up representing violence as a metaphysical attribute&#x02014;a "palpable revelation of mystic otherness" (<i>WL,</i> 403). Somewhat paradoxically, given the unavoidable presence of World War I, Lewis in particular joins Lawrence in releasing suffering and violence from military conflict, freeing them to represent apocalypse oxymoronically, as peaceful and painless. One effect is to countermand notions of democracy by highlighting their reliance on hypocrisy and cant. Thus Birkin tells Hermione during one especially explosive incident, "Your democracy is an absolute lie&#x02014;your brotherhood of man is a pure falsity" (<i>WL,</i> 161). Another, more paradoxical effect is to recast anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice by advancing impersonal perspectives on hostility. Lawrence developed this last emphasis in <i>Women in Love</i> by twinning eschatology with mindlessness, a happy reprieve from the "anguish of consciousness" (<i>WL,</i> 432).<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the war's carnage was unprecedented, resulting in the death of some 8.5 million soldiers and up to 13 million civilians, this approach to violence&#x02014;whether provocative or callous&#x02014;deserves careful examination.
</p>

<p>
Later sections of this essay indicate how Lawrence's and Lewis's similar perspectives on violence depart from Edwardian patriotism and fears that Germany might invade Britain, the latter helping to intensify the country's xenophobia and anti-Semitism. William Le Queux's <i>Invasion of 1910,</i> Erskine Childers's <i>Riddle of the Sands,</i> and H. G. Wells's <i>War in the Air,</i><sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  popular in their own right, drew for inspiration on such cautionary works as Lord Balfour's <i>Decadence: Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture</i> , published three years after he'd served as Prime Minister; Archibald Hurd's "England's Peril&#x02014;Invasion or Starvation"; and Elliott Mills's anonymous 1905 Tory pamphlet, <i>The Decline and Fall of the British Empire,</i> a satirical "account of those causes which resulted in the destruction of our late Ally, together with a comparison between the British and Roman Empires. Appointed for use in the National Schools of Japan. Tokio, 2005."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Reviewed prominently by several mainstream newspapers, the latter text circulated widely.
</p>

<p>
Several legislative measures also point to the Edwardians' growing xenophobia. The 1905 Aliens Act&#x02014;based on the Report of the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, two years earlier&#x02014;recommended curbing immigration, weakening the legal status of so-called "undesirable aliens" in Britain, and excluding Jews.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  A resurgence of British anti-Semitism occurred several years later, too, owing partly to the 1909 "Tottenham Outrage," which resulted in three deaths and sixteen injuries, and especially to the 1911 Sidney Street siege, also occurring in East London, in which two Latvian immigrants (part of the Gardstein gang) held out against almost one thousand 

<b></b>

policemen, marksmen, and armed artillery.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Three police officers died during the bungled robbery that led to the siege and roughly two thousand rounds of ammunition were fired in a matter of days. Aided by the absurd presence of Winston Churchill, then Home Secretary, the press used the event to turn national opinion against "the abuse of this country's hospitality by . . . foreign malefactors."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The police received little assistance from local residents, many of them Jews from Russia and Latvia, who had fled from persecution abroad; hundreds of Londoners in fact turned out to witness the battle. Several months earlier, the classicist George Frederick Abbott had alluded to the "Tottenham Outrage" in "The Jewish Problem," published in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in April 1910. And despite favoring the country's acceptance of Jews, he pointed skeptically to multiple signs, political and social, that anti-Semitism was too widespread in Britain to enable their full integration.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
These and other events help contextualize the works I'll discuss, especially as comparable prejudice sometimes punctuates Lawrence's and Lewis's fiction. Completing his anti-Semitic story "The Unrest-Cure" the year that the Sidney Street siege erupted and a few months after "The Jewish Problem" appeared in print, Saki arguably went furthest among the three writers in dramatizing xenophobia, thereby narrowing a gap between cultural and psychic violence that Lawrence and Lewis tried strategically to widen. Yet none of them merely echoed ideas reverberating in their culture, and invoking the context of prejudice is helpful only to a degree, because their literature surpasses it, raising broader questions about national loyalty, group ties, and responsibility to the world at large. Lawrence, in particular, insisted that aspects of life display an "untranslatable otherness," something which historicist criticism tends to ignore.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Conceptually rich and nondoctrinaire, his fiction indicates with Lewis's and Saki's how, during wartime, imaginary violence is both over- and underdetermined, freeing readers from history and catastrophe while also binding us to a different set of cultural and psychic concerns&#x02014;the consequences, in particular, of our noxious pleasure and misanthropy. As Lawrence fulminates in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> , "Oh, ideal humanity, how detestable and despicable you are! And how you deserve your own poison-gases! How you deserve to perish in your own stink!"<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Here, as elsewhere, his anger oscillates between two extremes, disparaging cultural ideals that exhort us to attain impossible perfection while heaping contempt on humanity's ongoing, hubristic bid to attain that goal. Like his characters, too, Lawrence's fiction distinguishes only hazily between personal and impersonal violence. Still, it's necessary to engage his, Saki's, and Lewis's claims about hatred, and to resist the urge to dismiss their fantasies as politically grotesque. My essay hews this vexed, sometimes nebulous line. While dismissing works distances critics from what we analyze, generating false comfort, it replicates a problem that Lawrence especially tried to solve. A stolid commitment to engaging such fantasies is thus, I believe, the only responsible way to understand not only imaginary violence, but also why anti-Semitism and pre-Holocaust fantasies flourished in wartime fiction.
</p>

<p>
Voicing "radical antagonism" (<i>WL,</i> 335) with relentless persistence, <i>Women in Love</i> complicates two modernist principles that critics have tended to idealize: a notion of 

<b></b>

flux, on the one hand, and literature's alleged ability to save us from the catastrophes of history, on the other. Lawrence thwarts both principles by augmenting his characters' petty rivalries into fierce clashes of impersonal will. He styles rivalry, as do Saki and Lewis, as a volatile dialectic between freedom and commitment, movement and stasis, violence and tranquillity&#x02014;an "eternal see-saw," as the narrator puts it, with one person "destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified because the other was nulled" (<i>WL,</i> 542).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One aspect of this seesaw is that Lawrence nudged his characters toward radical forms of self-divestiture. The narrator of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> calls Paul Morel "infinitesimal, at the core a nothingness, and yet not nothing"; indeed, after his mother dies, Morel feels "press[ed] . . . into extinction."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  A similarly spare conception of subjectivity drives <i>Women in Love</i> and Lawrence's other postwar works (Harold Bloom calls this his "apocalyptic vitalism").<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  What remains hauntingly open-ended in Lawrence's fiction is the relationship between these forms of violence and the meanings&#x02014;and even ethical principles&#x02014;that he ascribes to them.
</p>

If we wanted examples of petty rivalry in his fiction, we wouldn't have very far to look. Describing the first signs of domestic misery in Walter and Gertrude Morel's marriage, the narrator of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> alludes to a "bloody battle," (<i>SL,</i> 22) before using the noun or verb <i>battle</i> twenty-two more times in that novel, just a few times less than the noun/verb <i>torture</i> and the adjective <i>tortured</i> (at thirty-two times).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Prone to similar hyperbole, the narrator of <i>Women in Love</i> calls Birkin's engagement argument with Ursula "a crisis of war" that erupts after "the old way of love" is pronounced "a dreadful bondage, a sort of conscription" (<i>WL,</i> 387, 269). Their row turns an ordinary patch of woodland into a "memorable battle-field" (<i>WL,</i> 393), and so on. Nevertheless, the "war" in both novels loses psychological specificity rather than gaining it. So although the context of militarism underwrites Lawrence's argument in the later novel, interpersonal friction governs his overall conception of the social, not the reverse.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> <i>Women in Love</i> adopts military rhetoric when theorizing social antagonism, that is, but forms of impersonal violence overwhelm the conflict and possible victory. Critics interested in the context of Lawrence's writing often view this emphasis as one of his most irritating, but the argument here is better inverted: Lawrence's willingness to bracket social determinants in fact gave him new ways of conceptualizing human relations, based precisely on their "untranslatable otherness," their inchoate difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Violence in <i>Women in Love</i> tends to connote a force independent of persons, with the power to erase deficiencies in humanity and thus to bring about a blissful state of nonbeing. "Mindless at last" is the supreme achievement of Birkin and Gerald's "gladiatorial" wrestle, because it lets them "wait . . . dimly, in a sort of not-being, for many uncounted, unknown minutes" (<i>WL,</i> 349, 350). Lawrence admires this ontological unraveling; it leaves the men "vague and unestablished" and results in general formlessness, as though "the world [were] sliding, everything [were] sliding off into the darkness" (<i>WL,</i> 351, 349). By pressing violence beyond psychological causes, the narrator credits it with significance surpassing group and individual motivations. Paul Morel describes a similar phenomenon in <i>Sons and Lovers</i>: "To be rid of our individuality, which is our will, which is our effort&#x02014;to live effortless, a kind of conscious sleep&#x02014;that is very beautiful, I think&#x02014;that is our after-life&#x02014;our immortality" (<i>SL,</i> 331-2).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These elliptical claims highlight the effort required to live effortlessly in Lawrence's imaginary worlds, but merely invoking that paradox doesn't alter its efficacy in his fiction. <i>Women in Love</i> in particular styles impersonal violence ascetically, as a path to self-divestiture and nonbeing; it also harnesses several determinants, including acute misanthropy, to achieve these ends. The novel lets the characters extend domestic conflict into a realm that is "stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility," because personhood is no longer relevant there (<i>WL,</i> 208). Assessing Ursula's "exquisite force of hatred" for Rupert after his bungled proposal of marriage, for instance, the narrator observes: "Her relation was ultimate and utterly beyond words, the hate was so pure and gem-like. It was as if he were a beam of essential enmity, a beam of life that did not only destroy her, but denied her altogether, revoked her whole world. . . . It stunned and annihilated her" (<i>WL,</i> 267, 268).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Even when described metaphorically, with Lawrentian hyperbole, these fantasies often glide into genocidal contemplation as characters train murderous rage into apocalyptic visions. The idea of ridding the planet of humanity intoxicates especially Birkin, because it seems to promise an ecological harmony that's impossible without humanity's extinction. He speculates as well that the impulse to rob others of life is exquisitely pleasurable and even ethically defensible, because it stems from contempt for their noxious joy. Nor is he alone in voicing this fantasy or experiencing a rage so extreme it briefly obliterates consciousness. In the novel's opening chapter, in which Ursula and Gudrun observe a local wedding, Gudrun is overwhelmed by disgust at the townspeople: "A sudden fierce anger swept over the girl, violent, and murderous. She would have liked them all to be annihilated, cleared away, so that the world was left clear for her" (<i>WL,</i> 59-60). Still, Birkin tries to depersonalize these fantasies, musing periodically that his hoping for "a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up" is "the most beautiful and freeing thought." "I would die like a shot," he later tells Ursula, "to know that the earth would really be cleaned of all the people. . . . Then there would <i>never</i> be another foul humanity created, for a universal defilement" (<i>WL,</i> 188; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
Although it's tempting to connect these statements to Lawrence's antitechnological modernism&#x02014;apparent in the opening paragraphs of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> and in "Odour of Chrysanthemums" &#x02014;such claims are only partly correct and by no means limited to his work. Similar, intense beliefs haunt other examples of Georgian literature, provoking in post-1918 writers the retrospective fantasy of an Edwardian Arcadia, whereby the fantasy becomes all the more urgent because the desired serenity is impossible to recover.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  As Lawrence put it elliptically, "Something very good, and poignant to remember, now the whole world of it is lost."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Calling "'16, '17, '18, '19" "awful years," he inveighed against the "terrible, terrible war" that created a "sudden presence of murder in the air," letting loose on England "a wave of criminal lust."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Countless poets and novelists voiced analogous claims about prewar culture, trying mentally to replace the carnage with images of a pastoral sanctuary. Among such idealizations are Siegfried Sassoon's memoirs, Rupert Brooke's "Soldier"  and, to a lesser degree, Robert Graves's "To Robert Nichols," which asks its addressee, in plaintive recognition of all now lost:

But Lawrence arguably went furthest in tying such "recollections" to almost Edenic conceptions of <i>non</i>being. As Birkin explains, "I want to be gone out of myself, and you to be lost to yourself, so we are found different" (<i>WL,</i> 255). This shift in emphasis highlights our interpretive difficulty: While intense fantasies about prewar life seem proportional to perceptions of devastation outlasting the conflict, Birkin's belief in global perfectibility can't finally integrate or curb the novel's austere misanthropy, its yearning for a "humanless world" (<i>WL,</i> 188).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Accompanying Lawrence's account of impersonal violence is his attempt at reconceiving character, a logical extension of his intellectual aims: "You mustn't look in my novel for the old stable <i>ego</i>&#x02014;of the character," he told Edward Garnett in a well-known letter, disdainful of nineteenth-century thoughts on motive and personality. "There is another <i>ego,</i> according to whose action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to exercise, to discover are states of the same single radically unchanged element."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Here, Lawrence revokes, rather than reforms, conventional ideas about self-strangeness by pushing subjectivity into a different experiential register. Similar aesthetic impulses recur in <i>The Man Who Died,</i> his last novel, where the narrator describes the violence of "men and women alike . . . mad with the egoistic fear of their own nothingness," (<i>MWD,</i> 38) and in the late poem "Death Is not Evil, Evil Is Mechanical," where the speaker calls "the obscene ego"

</blockquote>

<p>
Once we dismiss such orthodox notions of character, Lawrence implies, the ego can no longer recognize itself or its place in the world. The individual must develop new relations to others, based paradoxically on a willingness to forgo self-understanding&#x02014;even if this hastens death.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The narrator of <i>Women in Love</i> calls this "lapsing out" of familiar selfhood (<i>WL,</i> 94, 245, 320, 353, 399), repeating a phrase from <i>Sons and Lovers</i>;<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  and Birkin endorses this idea when insisting, somewhat confusedly: "At the very last, one is alone, beyond the influence of love. There is a real impersonal me, that is beyond love, beyond any emotional relationship" (<i>WL,</i> 207-8). For other writers, "impersonal me" would be oxymoronic. That Lawrence yoked these terms highlights competing tensions that his novel explored but can't ultimately resolve.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Despite his frustration with Lawrence's didacticism, Lewis shared his belief that postwar attempts at restoring selfhood were misleading&#x02014;indeed, repressive and de-sexualizing. "To 'develop the personality' is an alluring invitation," he observed in "An Analysis of the Mind of James Joyce" , "but it invariably covers some process that is guaranteed to strip a person bare of all 'personality' in a fortnight. This does not seem to me necessarily a bad thing. I am only pointing out that this excellent result is obtained by fraud. So we must not take that fraud too seriously, however much we may applaud its aims."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  That Lewis was thoroughly critical of Lawrence, calling him a "preacher" and "insufferable moralist," doesn't obviate their shared conceptual goals, as I'll explain in the final section of this essay.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How, then, do impersonal, self-divesting impulses manifest in their fiction, and why in Lawrence's case do they so often fail? Leo Bersani explains that Lawrence viewed the drives motivating individuals as "attempts to enlarge on or to obliterate the very field in which the anecdotes of personality are possible."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  "Attempts" is the operative word. Impersonality is Lawrence's imaginary path to nonbeing, an ideal representing nonviolent detachment, but neither outcome is possible without the type of agitation or unrest that strips individuals of their fantasies and attachments. Unrest is part of the alleged "cure," in other words, because it compels the ego to relinquish all self-serving illusions. All the same, stasis is a condition his characters attain only fleetingly, and&#x02014;doubtless related&#x02014;Lawrence was generally more adept at critiquing the ego than imagining what might replace it. Self-divestiture therefore tends to be gestural in his work, an aspiration his characters forestall in fierce reenactments of will; overall, <i>Women in Love</i> alternates between canceling individuality and restoring a type of oneness that reinstates fantasies of self-harmonious and proprietary consciousness.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Exemplifying the latter tendency, Hermione Roddice, Birkin's first serious lover and a satirical portrait of the bohemian patroness Lady Ottoline Morrell, garners most disdain in the novel by epitomizing an alternative, idealized, yet ultimately ego-bound notion of harmony. Striving to conceive of equality between men and women, and among humankind, she exaggerates the possibility of eventual peace: "<i>If</i> . . . we could only realise, that in the <i>spirit</i> we are all one, all equal in the spirit, all brothers there&#x02014;the rest wouldn't matter, there would be no more of this carping and envy and this struggle for power, which destroys, only destroys" (<i>WL,</i> 161; italics in original). When contradicted by Birkin, though, she erupts in rage, looking "at him with leering eyes, along her cheeks. He could feel violent waves of hatred and loathing of all he said, coming out of her" (<i>WL,</i> 162). Hopelessly confused and self-ignorant, Hermione grasps Birkin's thoughts on the fiction of democracy only "in her unconscious self" (<i>WL,</i> 162).
</p>

<p>
Yet the sadistic fantasies that erupt after Hermione's "humiliation" not only shape this novel, but also generate a form of enjoyment that Lawrence views as inseparable from hatred and, later, as its tautological explanation. Since all his protagonists experience joy when contemplating what's most nauseating about other people, they indicate the centrality of this phenomenon in affairs both amorous and political, showing in the process how psychic concerns can thwart democratic aspirations. Arguably more

As Hermione strikes Birkin repeatedly with a stone, the act gives her "unutterable satisfaction" (<i>WL,</i> 163). Indeed, guilt, reason, and above all love fail to restrain her: "She must smash [his head], it must be smashed before her ecstasy was consummated, fulfilled for ever. <i>A thousand lives, a thousand deaths mattered nothing now,</i> only the fulfillment of this perfect ecstasy" (<i>WL,</i> 163; emphasis added).
</p>

<p>
This "voluptuous" joy often recurs in Lawrence's, Saki's, and Lewis's fiction, generating apocalyptic scenarios spawned by their characters' insatiable hostility. One sees the philosophical effects of such depersonalized perspectives, too, in paintings like Paul Nash's <i>We Are Making a New World</i> (1918; <a href="#1"> 1</a>) and Lewis's disturbing <i>Inferno</i> (1937; <a href="#2"> 2</a>). In the former&#x02014;a polluted but otherwise empty landscape by the First World War's official British artist&#x02014;the rising sun, shorn of conventional symbolism, spotlights an ownerless, unmappable terrain that repeated military conflict seems to have desecrated. The land is thus inimical to life. The repetition of forms in Nash's painting blocks regeneration, illustrating the fundamental paradox of his title: the new world we are making may have no place for us. In Lewis's painting, completed shortly before the outbreak of World War II and thus both prescient and retrospective in its haunting vision of hell, a heap of corpses with grinning skulls seems to embrace&#x02014;and perhaps also to strangle&#x02014;faces and bodies that are featureless, sexless, and barely human. One can't establish whether some of them are sleeping or dead, the others laughing in erotic pleasure or orgiastic violence. Any exit from Lewis's inferno is blocked, moreover, by another group of formless, unidentifiable bodies.
</p>

<p>
Both paintings represent ideas similar to Lawrence's fiction, though the latter differs from Nash in accepting that "voluptuous" joy is both a precondition for intimacy and an unpleasant residue limning our relation to other people. Lawrence also indicates in <i>Women in Love</i> that <i>less</i> (not more) consciousness might thwart our reliance on such volatile ecstasy. While attempting to curb its symptomatic power, that is, he augments a desire for integrity based, as in Nash's and Lewis's paintings, on nonbeing. Torn between these irreconcilable aims, the novel's desire for integrity clashes with its interest in "self-obliterat[ion]" and "lapse[s] into unknowingness" (<i>WL,</i> 65, 94).
</p>

<p>
But because Lawrence shows how easily Hermione's ecstasy would let her ignore "a thousand deaths," he clarifies&#x02014;without endorsing&#x02014;the psychic constituents of a holocaust. Educating us erratically in crises of propinquity through its diligent exposure

of unexamined hatred, <i>Women in Love</i> may in fact be viewed as a defense against militarism and fascism. Granted, this reading differs from literalist approaches to his work, in which the representation of ideas seems equivalent to their authorial endorsement (Lawrence apparently must condone what he describes). But, crucially, Lawrence represents a space between fantasy and act; his characters' dilemmas aren't simple substitutes for his own; and what is discussed&#x02014;and sometimes enacted&#x02014;in his fiction is preventable in life.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Above all, in discussing humanity's impulse to commit atrocities, Birkin spotlights a painful gap between what we claim to advance (democracy, brotherhood, interpersonal union) and what we secretly hanker for (apocalypse, extinction, nonbeing). His claim that violence springs partly from a murderous dimension of joy also probes self-directed antagonism and what many assume is a better remedy: repression-induced tolerance. The latter downplays mundane acts of complicity and passive acquiescence, rendering exceptional such complex factors as the obscene "ecstasy" that can accrue from another's suffering.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  As long as we repress this unpleasant truth, implies Lawrence's protagonist, humankind will reel from one bloodbath to another, oblivious to the tragic reasons for this repetition.
</p>

<p>
We secretly yearn for mass destruction, claims Birkin, whose insistence on this "seeth[ing]" quality of desire rebukes progressivist assumptions underlying such disparate philosophies as Benthamite Utilitarianism, Comtean Positivism, and Christian teleology (<i>WL,</i> 238). "We always consider the silver river of life, rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness, on and on to heaven, flowing into a bright eternal sea, a heaven of angels thronging," he tells Ursula sardonically, "but the other is our real reality . . . the dark river of dissolution.&#x02014;You see it rolls in us just as the other rolls&#x02014;the black river of corruption" (<i>WL,</i> 238). Once estranged from this destiny, a result of our commitment to identity, we are, according to Birkin, more likely to provoke destruction unthinkingly.
</p>

<p>
Before we champion the examined life as our panacea, however, Lawrence complicates matters by representing consciousness as part of the problem. Birkin's philosophy hinges on both meanings of <i>integrity</i>&#x02014;honesty and completeness&#x02014;and though the first quality in <i>Women in Love</i> (and in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i>) is conceptually precise, the second (wholeness) is not. Birkin holds tenaciously to both meanings when developing his thoughts on nonbeing, but by the end of the novel honesty and completeness seem mutually exclusive, and even self-canceling. One reason for this is Birkin's psychic and conceptual problems marrying another's self-completion to his own. As Michael Levenson observes, Birkin finds it easier to tolerate nothingness, oneness, and even multiplicity than duality. Another's self-regard disgusts him when it collides with his own.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Hermione's outburst against all "unthinkable evil obstruction[s]" certainly influences&#x02014;and, to some extent, justifies&#x02014;Birkin's contempt for humans' bad faith (<i>WL,</i> 163). But as he inveighs against this dishonesty, acute misanthropy overwhelms his argument, tipping it toward an apocalyptic extreme that isn't vastly dissimilar from Hermione's. Inadvertently endorsing her "voluptuous ecstasy," Birkin allows contempt

<p>
Voicing many of Lawrence's thoughts on democracy's "absolute lie" (<i>WL,</i> 187) as well as his profound despair at the "idiocy" of the war, Birkin could seem merely an authorial puppet here.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Partly owing to the horror of this war, and Lawrence's ill-health, increasing poverty, and bitter frustration at the immediate suppression of <i>The Rainbow,</i> he and Frieda Weekley left Britain in 1919, returning later, sporadically, but only for brief visits.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Frieda's nationality was itself a political issue, of course, and while still in Britain she and Lawrence were treated like German spies. This may have heightened his sense of national betrayal, as well as the violent collisions that <i>Women in Love</i> stages between Eros and politics. Before the war, he and Frieda traveled in Germany and across the Alps, but thereafter they moved restlessly from Italy to Sicily, Ceylon and Australia to New Mexico, and from Mexico back to Italy, with Lawrence concluding his life in the south of France. Presumptions about Lawrence's exact relation to his fiction are, however, misleading. Although Lawrence was interested, around August 1915, in developing an ideal community (Rananim) in Florida, later relocated in 1921 to Taos, New Mexico,<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Birkin shuns such aspirations and promptly returns us to the obstacle of other people's noxious joy. His fantasy of renewal reinforces, rather than discredits, Hermione's ecstatic disregard for other people and Gudrun's fleeting dream of a global massacre.
</p>

<p>
<i>Women in Love</i> forks when engaging these pleasures. One strand continues associating impersonal violence with eschatology, but the other strand, repsychologizing this violence with a vengeance, ties it explicitly to Judaism. When expounding on this joy, then, the novel appears most anti-Semitic. In "Cr&#x000E8;me de Menthe," an earlier chapter satirizing vacuous hedonism in bohemian London, the character Pussum denounces a man for whom Gerald conceives a mild erotic attraction, calling Julius a contemptible Jew (<i>WL,</i> 124).<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  And in Birkin's second statement about "dirty" humanity, he pronounces a fervent desire to "be rid of the most ghastly, heavy crop of Dead Sea fruit, the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people, and infinite weight of mortal lies" (<i>WL,</i> 187). The allusion is somewhat elliptical, referring to the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (built by the shores of the Dead Sea, too salty to sustain life), but the metaphor reinforces anti-Semitic associations running throughout the novel. When decrying the "apples of Sodom," Birkin also implies that the annihilation of Sodomites&#x02014;a noun originally denoting the inhospitable&#x02014;would help precipitate global serenity.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This dynamic recurs at various points in the novel, showing how quickly the "eternal see-saw" of human relations can degenerate into warlike conditions among competing groups and societies. The novel's conception of nature doesn't soften this problem, but exacerbates its effects by insisting that competition and strength are appropriate correctives to otherwise forceless characters and enfeebled relations. Similar notions recur in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious,</i> especially in the chapter "The Lower Self," and one of many examples in the slightly earlier <i>Women in Love</i> is Gerald's reactionary commentary on patriotism and race. Unlike Birkin's well-marked fantasies of self-obliteration, however, Gerald's operate in the service of the ego, as triumphant contempt for weaker people and nations. At such moments, the novel's impersonalist conception of violence reverts clumsily to an ego-based psychology, and thus to all of the problems stemming from proprietary consciousness:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"A race may have its commercial aspect," [Gerald] said. "In fact it must. It is like a family. You <i>must</i> make provision. And to make provision you have got to strive against other families, other nations. I don't see why you shouldn't." . . .
<p class="blockquote">
"I must say," said Birkin, "I detest the spirit of emulation." . . .
<p class="blockquote">
"But," Gerald insisted, "you don't allow one man to take away his neighbour's living, so why should you allow one nation to take away the living from another nation?"

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
If readers accept Gerald's vexed simile that a "race . . . is like a family," must they also "make provision" for a family's or nation's surplus enjoyments? This question stems from the novel's foundational metaphors and perspective on interpersonal friction, obliging characters to recognize why they experience other people's lives and satisfactions as abhorrent, repulsive. Hermione is surely right to ask whether "the patriotic appeal [is] . . . to the racial instinct," but Gerald wins the argument at its most elemental (<i>WL,</i> 77). "If I go and take a man's hat from off his head," he responds, "that hat becomes a symbol of that man's liberty. When he ts me for his hat, he is ting me for his liberty" (<i>WL,</i> 78). Hermione might well accuse him of vulgar materialism and Birkin later insinuate that Gerald suffers from barely repressed violence, but by that point we know that Hermione's and Birkin's idealisms betray extreme fantasies of their own. "Sometimes you talk pure nonsense," Gerald insists when responding to the charge of repressed violence. "As a matter of fact, none of us wants our throat cut, and most other people would like to cut it for us" (<i>WL,</i> 82). Freud, to name just one influential thinker, would later base much of <i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i> (1929, revised 1930) on a similar idea. When engaging, as does Lawrence, with the biblical commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself, Freud responded provocatively with blankness: "Why should we . . . ?"<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"To make provision you have got to strive against other families, other nations": this sententious idea strengthens Gerald's reactionary politics, forging an imperialist link between his patriotism and the novel's account of nature. Birkin and Gudrun can offer only misanthropy or dreams of humanity's extinction as weak alternatives. The novel can't resolve this principal difficulty, as I mentioned earlier, since its model of ego-based violence and impersonal conception of character pull in contrary directions.

<p>
Unable to resolve this impasse without lapsing into fractiousness, <i>Women in Love</i> highlights the repercussions of not leaving room for other people's enjoyment. When the two primary couples travel to the Tyrol, in southern Germany, Gudrun's disgust resurfaces as violent contempt for Gerald. She flirts extensively with Loerke, a German sculptor whose work, displaying "a frenzy of chaotic motion," at first seems inimical to Gerald's vision of the world (<i>WL,</i> 517). Birkin, Gerald, and eventually Ursula despise Loerke's granite frieze, but Lawrence leaves us in no doubt that Loerke's fascination with "org[ies] of enjoyment" reproduces, in distorted form, their aversion to others' noxious pleasure. He represents, that is, what they merely enunciate.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The voluptuous joy guiding Lawrence's account of hatred also recurs when Gerald and Birkin, ruminating on "stages further in social hatred" (<i>WL,</i> 522), try to explain Gudrun's fascination with the sculptor. Having insisted that "women want . . . some satisfaction in basic repulsion" (<i>WL,</i> 522), Birkin says that Loerke "lives like a rat, in the river of corruption, just where it falls over into the bottomless pit. . . . He <i>hates</i> the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a Jew&#x02014;or part Jewish" (<i>WL,</i> 522-3; italics in original). When Gerald agrees, owing partly to jealousy, Birkin finds the hitherto missing "logic" of his assumption, the conclusion making unpleasant sense of his fantasy: "He is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life" (<i>WL,</i> 523).
</p>

<p>
We might be tempted to leave things here, dismissing Birkin (and perhaps Lawrence) as anti-Semitic. Given the latter's and other writers' concern with group antagonism, their characters' phobic fantasies are easily perceived as projections of "the Other," a term conflating sundry monsters of alterity. This reading isn't entirely wrong: Lawrence, Lewis, and others do sometimes negate Jews and many others, and among Lawrence's preposterous statements in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> is his apparent belief that "the Jewish mind insidiously drives us to anarchical conclusions," a statement appearing just after his admiring claim that "the Jewish intelligence for centuries has been picking holes in our ideal system&#x02014;scientific and sociological" (<i>FU,</i> 181). But such emphasis fails to grasp the psychic rationale for Lawrentian antagonism, tending also to imply that the principles motivating Christian men differ qualitatively, even structurally, from those galvanizing other groups. According to <i>Women in Love,</i> by contrast, everybody lives in a state of near-constant antagonism with everyone else.
</p>

<p>
Rather than advancing unequivocal prejudice, then, <i>Women in Love</i> arguably educates us in crises of propinquity. Lawrence tracks the paths of his characters' perverse excitement and violence as they t to sustain ecstasy at the expense of others&#x02014;often the very people they claim to love and need most. At this interpersonal level, the effects can be facile, even tediously predictable. When expanded (as the novel encourages) into a general statement about failed sociability and a metaphor for international conflict, however, the argument is bracing and poignant. Like several of his contemporaries, Lawrence finds it impossible to conceive of intimacy devoid of violence. So, rather than taking a superior stance and denouncing the novel's anti-Semitism and misogyny, we might read the novel's ceaseless antagonisms as indicating why individuals and groups fail to coexist, despite striving otherwise, because their identities impinge on and deplete those with whom they joylessly collide.

</p>

<p>
Recognizing that this dynamic surfaces in works pushing for a similar redefinition of character, let me pause and glance back at a text that is less ingenuous about its motives and the paradoxes it unearths.

<p class="noIndent">
Noting humanity's complex multiplicity in his <i>Commonplace Book,</i> Saki stressed the resilience of several peculiar traits. "Man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations," he declared with Wildean overtones, "a complete multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very soul was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  As partial confirmation of this statement, Saki wrote brilliantly crafted tales and novellas whose key trait is gleeful malice. His witty dandies frequently humiliate hapless strangers, distant relatives, and unwelcome guests. Less well-known is a quasi-genocidal fantasy he wrote in 1911, "The Unrest-Cure," which represents its imagined violence as a boyish prank upsetting a sedate English village. Like <i>Women in Love</i> and Lewis's <i>Apes of God</i> , Saki's story highlights disturbing eschatological impulses and impersonal forms of violence.
</p>

<p>
Hector Hugh Munro (pseudonym Saki; 1870-1916) was a complex re who renounced his homosexuality as a symptom of fin de si&#x000E8;cle decadence. Before he died ting in World War I, he promoted an austere, almost fascistic love for Britain and its waning empire. His 1914 novella <i>When William Came</i> joined Le Queux's <i>Invasion of 1910</i> and other texts in predicting that unless Britain adopted harsher military policies, Germany would soon occupy London and England's southern counties.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  A nostalgic paean for Victorian imperialism, the novella also wrestles with a belief that Germany is superior to Britain and better suited to world rule.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  This identification with power recurs in Saki's other fiction: <i>Beasts and Superbeasts</i> , his fifth collection, turns stories about various animals into allegories of human treachery. These works mix Saki's urbane dandies, incongruously, with the militaristic fervor that punctuates Munro's contemporaneous journalism.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly every red-blooded human boy has had war, in some shape or form, for his first love," Munro intoned in one article, adopting the kind of rhetoric that Lawrence would later parody.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
If his blood has remained red and he has kept some of his boyishness in after-life, that first love will never have been forgotten. No one could really forget those wonderful leaden cavalry soldiers. . . . There were other unforgettable memories for those who had brothers to play with and t with, of sieges and ambushes and pitched encounters, of the slaying of an entire garrison without quarter, or of chivalrous, punctilious courtesy to a defeated enemy. Then there was the slow unfolding of the long romance of actual war, particularly of European war, ghastly, devastating, heartrending in its effect, and yet somehow captivating to the imagination. . . . The thrill that those far-off things call forth in us may be ethically indefensible, but it comes in the first place from something too deep to be driven out; the magic region of the Low Countries is beckoning to us again, as it beckoned to our forefathers, who went campaigning there almost from force of habit.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</blockquote>

<p>
Munro tries to soften his admission that war "may be ethically indefensible" by declaring that violence in "nearly every red-blooded human boy" derives "from something too deep to be driven out." Joining numerous militarists, he uses the second claim to argue that war is fit, even inevitable, and thus implies that it is ethically <i>defensible.</i> The word "nearly" is also a crucial qualifier in his argument, as Saki elsewhere berated effeminate men for treating the First World War as theater: "The 'Boys of the Lap-dog breed' remain trilling their songs, capering their dances, [and] speaking their lines as complacently as though no war was in progress." "They have set themselves as something apart," he opined, "and after the War let them be treated as something apart, something human and decorative and amusing; but something not altogether British, not exactly masculine, something that one does not treat as an equal."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  "It is inconceivable," he added in a different article dating also from 1915, "that these persons were ever boys, they certainly have not grown up into men; one cannot call them womanish&#x02014;the women of our race are made of different stuff. They belong to no sex."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Here, strangely, Saki sounds very much like Lawrence in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> and <i>Aaron's Rod.</i>
</p>

<p>
But complicating Munro's resolve is his self-incarnation as "Saki," borrowed from the last stanza of <i>The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam</i> (first English translation 1859), which plays archly on his own homosexuality (Saki was an Oriental Ganymede). His heroes, confirmed bachelors, are liminal res testing the separation of masculinity and femininity, as well as childhood and the adult world. To this extent, Munro's pen name and most of his fiction epitomize the "trilling" and "capering" he later would denounce.
</p>

<p>
This oscillation between dandyism and militarism points to a tension in not only Munro's identifications, but also British culture at the turn of the century. Consider Ford Madox Ford's willingness to echo Kipling's famous mantra, published a decade earlier, about the White Man's Burden. In his 1909 editorial to the <i>English Review,</i> Ford exhorted readers to assume "the duty of an Imperial race," since in his words Britain stood "in a different plane of civilisation from almost all our neighbours," and should thus "be prepared, for the sake of humanity to be able, not only to maintain ourselves but to maintain the integrity of the nations most allied to us in the love for peace and civilisation."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Other signs of this cultural shift and increased conservatism include the trials and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde, legislative efforts to curb homo- and heterosexual prostitution in London and other British cities, and a bizarre libel case following the first performance in England of Wilde's decadent play <i>Salom&#x000E9;,</i> fully eighteen years after he had died.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  At one point in 1918, the trauma Wilde allegedly had caused England in 1895 scandalously was invoked as a reason the country was losing the war.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When he alludes to the "monstrous maladies" tainting man's "soul," Saki seems unconsciously to repeat how Wilde represented his imprisonment, in <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>  and <i>De Profundis</i> , and to corroborate his own journalistic assertion that the "ethically indefensible" is "too deep to be driven out."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Indeed, Saki's phrase highlights both his identificatory dilemmas and those of the time (he and Wilde shared several friends, including Robert Ross and publisher John Lane). His 

<b></b>

appeal to depth may appear antimodernist, but "monstrous maladies" captures some of the Imagists' contempt for the ornamental. Overall, Saki was obsessed with the "ethically indefensible," and mined it for all its comic and macabre potential.
</p>

<p>
Yet even in comparison with his other fiction, "The Unrest-Cure" takes this principle to an extreme. The story is disturbing and jarringly effective, because it toys with the effects of under- and overreading: Downplay its subject and one risks trivializing the prejudice it exploits; focus only on its anti-Semitism, by contrast, and one misses its comic pretensions. The narrator archly insists that two key elements of English life, the Church and Boy Scouts, foster iniquity rather than purity. To that end, the story is mordantly funny. Still, Munro's almost fascistic politics complicates any formalist pleasure this light-hearted "masterpiece" can generate. No&#x000EB;l Coward makes this point when introducing Saki's <i>Complete Works,</i> and his assessment is notable because most Saki critics avoid mentioning, much less discussing, the story.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Munro's biographer merely adds, imprecisely, that the protagonist "thinks he is safely entombed in the country, and then a religious war breaks out on his doorstep" (<i>SLM,</i> 214).
</p>

<p>
The story begins in a train compartment. Clovis, one of Saki's recurring heroes, overhears a conversation between an unnamed friend and J. P. Huddle, who is visiting his sister in a quiet English village. Mr. Huddle admits to his friend that although his life is dreary, change upsets him: "I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. . . . We both feel that . . . change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating" (<i>CS,</i> 127). The friend responds: "You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment" (<i>CS,</i> 128).<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Asked for examples, the friend suggests visiting one of the Apache quarters of Paris or giving lectures in Berlin claiming Gambetta wrote most of Wagner's music.
</p>

<p>
Clovis decides to concoct Huddle's "Unrest-cure" by pretending to be Prince Stanislaus, secretary to the local bishop. After sending Huddle two contrived telegrams, Clovis persuades him that the Bishop will soon visit to plan a local massacre. "Tonight is going to be a great night in the history of Christendom . . . We're going to massacre every Jew in the neighbourhood" (<i>CS,</i> 129). Dumbstruck and indignant, Huddle first insists that the Bishop is "tolerant, humane," then exclaims, "He will be hanged!" before concluding: "But there aren't thirty Jews in the whole neighbourhood" (<i>CS,</i> 129). "We have twenty-six on our list," Clovis-as-Stanislaus responds. "We shall be able to deal with them all the more thoroughly" (<i>CS,</i> 129).
</p>

<p>
"Most of the killing will probably be done on the staircase," he adds breezily, insisting that he has sent "to the <i>Martin</i> and <i>Die Woche</i> . . . some photographs of [Huddle] and [his] sister" (<i>CS,</i> 130). When Sir Leon Birberry, "one of the most respected [Jews] in the country," arrives following Clovis's second telegraph, a "now thoroughly panic-stricken" Huddle hauls an astonished, "protesting" Birberry upstairs (<i>CS,</i> 131), while Clovis, sipping tea alone, plans his next move. After several hours, he tells Huddle that the Bishop will kill only with cold steel: "The Bishop does not see why a man should not be a gentleman as well as a Christian" (<i>CS,</i> 132). Clovis then vanishes, his unrest 

<b></b>

cure successful, leaving his now-hysterical victims to guess the meaning of his practical joke. Apparently, they grasp it none too quickly, and in mock-gothic language the narrator explains why: "[Al]though [Clovis] had left them for ever, the lurking suggestion of his presence haunted the lower regions of the house during the long hours of the wakeful night, and every creak of the stairway, every rustle of wind through the shrubbery, was fraught with horrible meaning" (<i>CS,</i> 132).
</p>

<p>
These plot details crystallize our interpretive dilemma when reading this macabre tale. While the suggestion of a massacre in a quiet English village is deliberately incongruous, "The Unrest-Cure" exploits many ironies, only the most obvious of which is its horrific anticipation of the Holocaust. That Saki's story should predict a similar event in 1911 as the "absurd" culmination of widespread Edwardian anti-Semitism sadly is not, as we've seen, especially remarkable.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Yet since English villages are, to some, the last places one would expect to find extreme violence, they are for comic purposes the most appropriate. Saki stages their repressive manner as a form of quiet viciousness requiring only the right catalyst to explode.
</p>

<p>
"The Unrest-Cure" strikes a frivolous tone, perhaps eliciting nervous laughter in readers, but should we read it only as a farce? If the joke is innocuous in Clovis's and Saki's minds, why are its final elements "fraught with horrible meaning"? Why, too, does Huddle's exclamation, "This thing will be a blot on the Twentieth Century!" draw from Clovis the disturbing rejoinder: "And your house will be the blotting-pad" (<i>CS,</i> 131)? Since anti-Semitic pamphlets were circulating as Saki was writing, claiming that "members of a foul Asiatic breed, composed of swindlers, thieves, anarchists and socialists . . . have captured and corrupted our Press, debased our politics, lessened our commercial fame, tainted our social life, filled our cities with vice, crime, and disease, and in other ways played the ingrate and traitor to the people they batten on, and the country they plague," his story arguably appealed to several constituencies as horrific wish fulfillment.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  For contemporary readers incapable of reading this story without judging it prescient, on a scale involving not one village, but millions of Jews from across central and eastern Europe, "The Unrest-Cure" represents the Holocaust as possible&#x02014;even desirable&#x02014;in a "civilized" community of rural England. One wonders, with hindsight, whether a different end to World War I, with the Treaty of Versailles generating crippling poverty and hyperinflation in Britain, could have sparked more anti-Semitic bloodshed in that country.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although such juxtapositions downplay the story's formal strengths and ghoulish humor, "The Unrest-Cure" works (as its title promises) by denying us interpretive comfort. The story's debt to <i>schadenfreude</i> isn't apparent without some relation to historical context yet, as in <i>Women in Love,</i> context alone can't explain, or fully absorb, its complex fantasy structure. Additionally, as in works by Lawrence and Lewis, Saki highlights a volatile gap between "character" and fantasy that manifests forms of exuberance and cruelty generally inimical to Edwardian society. In the story "Esm&#x000E9;," for instance, a hyena slinks around southern England, waiting to maul unwatched babies (<i>CS,</i> 101-5). At the end of "The Interlopers," wolves set upon squabbling neighbors (<i>CS,</i> 452). The list of examples proliferates, showing how Saki capitalizes on gleeful 

<b></b>

pleasures that accrue from others' misery, one reason readers find his work amusing, even disturbingly satisfying. As we saw earlier in <i>Women in Love,</i> there is pleasure in depleting another's joy, especially if that joy is perceived as ill-gotten. Hence the anti-Semitic pamphlet, cited above, referring not only to outright theft and parasitism, but also to Jews as "receivers, perjurers, forgers and swingers." Indeed, as Abbott notes in parentheses, after representing these terms, "([t]here follow twelve more epithets of like flavour)," all signaling a reckless&#x02014;even ecstatic&#x02014;multiplication of synonyms.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Strikingly, the three writers examined here aren't simply preoccupied with this dynamic; they base new conceptions of character on its precarious outcome.
</p>

<p>
The narrator of "The Unrest-Cure" distinguishes firmly between persons and entities, telling us that luggage belonging to "'J. P. Huddle, The Warren, Tilfield, near Slowborough'" sits atop "the human embodiment of the label" (<i>CS,</i> 127). In this way, he alerts us to a gap between Huddle's ontology and his social role.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The tale exploits this gap to Gothic effect, creating a monstrous antidote to English village life, but in doing so it magnifies a dimension of fantasy reducible to the control of neither the subject nor those who "enjoy" the imagined outcome. Clovis saunters off at the end, eschewing responsibility for his prank and the suffering it causes, but such narrative open-endedness in Edwardian fiction is notable. Perhaps it's also more ethical than at first it seems.
</p>

<p>
Reminding us that noxious enjoyment can arise from identity's radical incompletion, "The Unrest-Cure" exposes the havoc that fantasies like Clovis's can create. To that end, we could read the story counterintuitively, in ways similar to Lawrence's postwar narrative, as alerting us to the catastrophe it seems to presage. Like <i>Women in Love</i> and <i>The Apes of God,</i> "The Unrest-Cure" draws on eschatology without countenancing extinction; it does so by nudging Huddle and his sister toward "self-abolition" while ultimately protecting them from that catastrophe. The postman's arrival the next day "finally convince[s] the watchers that the Twentieth Century was still unblotted," but of course we can't read this line (or the story overall) and share the characters' relief (<i>CS,</i> 133). Perhaps only in hindsight, Saki's short story resembles a "hygienic practice of nonviolence," a phrase that Leo Bersani uses when arguing that the ego represents difference as a menacing threat to its specious coherence. "As soon as persons are posited," he declares, "the war begins."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The point for Bersani is that anti-identitarian fiction&#x02014;a term including the three central texts I discuss here&#x02014;does more than betray the ego's violent appropriation of reality; it also compels the subject to establish a new relation to the world.

<p class="noIndent">
Also intelligible in light of Bersani's argument, Lewis's <i>Apes of God</i> offers similar antifascist means of coping with propinquity. It does so not despite, but because of its endless fascination with the noxious pleasure of proximate groups. Such claims may strike Lewis's readers as preposterous, even as complicit with his apparent disdain for Jews, suffragettes, homosexuals, and so on. Many of these statements surface in <i>Tarr</i> 

<b></b>

 and recur in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>  and <i>Men without Art</i> . In the second text, Lewis amplifies the apparent "R&#x000F4;le of Inversion in the War on the Intellect" and calls "The 'Homo' the Child of the 'Suffragette'"; in the third text, the paradigm flips as he forges outrageous links between homosexuality and aggression: "And I suppose if you are homicidal, or homosexual, it is the same thing, it is all for the best or worst in the best or worst of all possible worlds."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Yet Lewis also shows that group antagonism is the norm rather than the exception (see, for example, his 1937 antiwar design, reprinted in <i>The Revenge for Love</i> [<a href="#3"> 3</a>]); and, like Freud, he asks us to consider whether demanding peace is less appealing, psychically, than professing outright enmity.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Above all, Lewis's obsession with stereotypes makes him a brilliant commentator on group fantasy. This counterintuitive approach to his work differs, I grant, from those who avoid reading or teaching him because his stereotypes are offensive. Lewis has in this regard suffered a fate worse than Lawrence's, but such responses preempt discussion without resolving anything. One hardly need add that if texts aren't read or published&#x02014;or even if they are burned&#x02014;the scope of related fantasies isn't markedly diminished.
</p>

<p>
After Lewis traveled in Germany, explains Hugh Kenner, he saw Jews and Gentiles as people who "had cheerfully turned themselves into racial stereotypes," a statement that helps explain Lewis's rationale in <i>The Apes of God.</i><sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  "I think [it could] quite safely be claimed," Lewis added, "that no book has ever been written that has paid more attention to the <i>outside</i> of people."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Stressing externality, Lewis eschewed "the <i>inner method"</i> of characterization as inappropriate for satire.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Careful to avoid missing a mannerism, he also devoted over six hundred pages to perfecting his stereotypes, the result being a curious blend of satire and affection. Finally, like Lawrence and Saki, he opens a crucial interpretive space between stereotypes and the res they designate, which makes Lewis more radical than most contemporary critics seem willing to admit.
</p>

<p>
One critic has called <i>The Apes of God</i> "an outburst of mirth at our expense," but the expense is really to identity as such.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Calling such laughter "caddish,"<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Lewis used it to skewer British affection for its aesthetic gods, falsely elevated in his mind, whose work and aims are entirely self-serving. Many of these false gods are Jewish and homosexual, signaling Lewis's attack on Bloomsbury and its allies ("Pierpointeans" in the novel, after the mysterious Pierpoint, who never appears). Bloomsbury was the main target of his "fiction-satire," because that group generally rejected satire and by his lights promoted a tepid definition of the artist and writer; but snobbery and parochialism riled Lewis most. "A sort of clinical religion is being built up to accommodate us," he explained in <i>The Art of Being Ruled,</i> four years earlier. "In every case it is our weakness, our smallness, our ignorance, or our dementia that is catered for."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
According to Paul Edwards, Lewis's "analysis is ideological, and implies no disapproval or approval of actual women, homosexuals or others except insofar as particular people allow themselves to be uncritically socially determined by the ideological stereotypes Lewis identifies."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Although well taken, this point represents the novel as 

<b></b>

satirical <i>and</i> politically correct, a defense that's especially futile because Edwards determines exactly whom Lewis was satirizing (his afterword supplies a list). Like many other satires, <i>The Apes of God</i> exults in being politically offensive. Still, Edwards implies correctly that homosexuality and Judaism weren't in themselves Lewis's target: what irked him was conceit and complacency, attributes irreducible to any single constituency.</p>

Rather than gauging the novel solely at the level of content, then, it seems more useful to determine what Lewis's preoccupation with homosexuality and Judaism tells us about the terms of his irritation and enjoyment. As before, with Lawrence and Saki, this approach insists that fiction isn't a loose conration of authorial wish-fulfillments (Lewis conceived of character and art in anti-intentionalist ways) and that fiction engaging an inhuman or impersonal register <i>neither reproduces nor corresponds to subjectivity.</i> "<i>Deadness</i> is the first condition of art," explains the eponymous protagonist of <i>Tarr.</i> "The second is absence of <i>soul,</i> in the sentimental human sense." 

<b></b>

"The lines and masses of the statue are its soul," he continues, repudiating Paterian impressionism; "No restless, quick flame-like ego is imagined for the <i>inside</i> of it. It has no inside. This is another condition of art; <i>to have no inside,</i> nothing you can <i>see.</i>"<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Such anti-identitarian statements not only break with anthropomorphism, as <i>Women in Love</i> tried and ultimately failed to do, but also compel us to read Lewis's work in nonmoral ways. To put this another way, critics reading his work through the lens of identity politics inevitably generate misprision.
</p>

<p>
Hostile to Stalinism and capitalism, as well as to modernists' belief in the redemptive power of art,<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  Lewis tried to destroy authoritarianism in all its obvious and insidious guises. "I believe I am alone among writers today," he declared,

in advocating no partisanship in the political field. Most adopt one of the two conventional extremes&#x02014;Marxism or royalism. But I am neither a King's Man nor a Collectivist.

Bad as Marxism may be (and it is now openly proclaimed&#x02014;and lauded by those who sponsor it&#x02014;as the terrorist absolutism of a Ghenghiz Khan), it cannot be much worse than the feudal and post-feudal monarchies of Europe. <i>Human life had better, here and now, and once and for all, be accepted as a very bad business indeed.</i><sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
Lewis wrote this in 1933-34, shortly after traveling to Germany, where he completed <i>Hitler,</i> a journalistic report published in 1931, two years before Hitler came to power. Profoundly depressed by the onset of World War II, he concluded <i>Men without Art</i> by saying that "we are merely <i>talking</i> monkeys . . . [but] enabled . . . to <i>know</i> that we are animals" (<i>MWA,</i> 231-2; italics in original). Later recanting in <i>The Hitler Cult</i>  and in his intellectual autobiography <i>Rude Assignment</i> , he called his short-lived interest in fascism "well-meaning imbecility . . . occupied . . . with the great and futile effort to avoid" war.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup> <i>Rude Assignment</i> is itself partly an attack on Hitler's "idiotic hatred of the Jews."<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  For many critics, then as now, the damage done by <i>Hitler</i> was irreparable, tarnishing Lewis's career and work. Yet, ironically, while his frustration with orthodoxy and identity politics gives his work fresh relevance today, Lewis's work actually warrants rereading in a less ideological light.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

In Part I of <i>The Apes of God,</i> Archie Margolin, a young Jew from London's East End, supplants the nineteen-year-old simpleton Daniel Boleyn as the object of Horace Zagreus's affection. (Mr. Zagreus, considerably older, fawns on beautiful young men, and Lewis based him partly on Virginia Woolf's friend Horace de Vere Cole.) When he learns this news, Boleyn's "perfectly handsome features" express "the deepest melancholy" (<i>AG,</i> 42). For much of this picaresque novel, we follow Boleyn (probably based on Stephen Spender) from one disastrous encounter to the next; he can neither make sense of his treatment nor stop being a victim to manipulative older men. We also learn predictable things about Archie Margolin, "the jew-boy from the slum," who seems "ill-assorted with the feminine gold of the crimped head and the insignificance of the body" (<i>AG,</i> 44, 45): "At the thought of gain"&#x02014;that is, of earning commission selling Dick a new wristwatch&#x02014;Archie is said to "bark" with a "small short cough of 

<b></b>

half-rabid waggishness, the militant slum-Jew in excelsis" (<i>AG,</i> 46). The narrator corroborates: "Hush! The instincts of the race probably at work&#x02014;he was <i>valuing!</i>" (<i>AG,</i> 50; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
Numerous quotations amplify these grotesque stereotypes, yet no sexual, ethnic, or racial group is exempt from Lewis's "cruel caricature" (<i>AG,</i> 53). Later chapters treat us to portrayals of lesbian "apes"&#x02014;"boy-scout spinster masculine rake[s]" living in a "monstrous colony" (<i>AG,</i> 222, 226, 233)&#x02014;and to anti-Semitic accounts of Julius Ratner (John Rodker), who "coo[s]" as a "very siamese-kittenish Joo" and "wail[s] . . . very very naughty, old Joo coyly&#x02014;[giving] his bed-clothed person a horrid homosexual waggle" (<i>AG,</i> 147, 149). As in Saki's and Lawrence's fiction, such racial and sexual stereotypes doubtless make readers wince, but they force us to rethink vexed&#x02014;and even frictional&#x02014;relations among character, identity politics, and impersonal violence, in ways that content-based literary criticism and cultural politics can make impossible. Fredric Jameson helped initiate this rereading by distinguishing between Lewis's and Lawrence's models of sexuality: "The peculiarity of Lewis' sexual ideology is that, while openly misogynist, and sexist in the obvious senses of the word, it is not for all that phallocentric."<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Lewis's own statements, cited earlier, show that he was keenly aware of stereotypes in political life, and used them primarily to shatter groups' self-consoling illusions. Such perspectives are more salient than many have acknowledged. Satirizing the conspiracy theories that as Abbott showed in 1911 inform anti-Semitism, Lewis, to give just one example in <i>The Apes of God,</i> comically redefines their phobic object. We're told that James, uncle to Dick Whittingdon (the latter probably based on the painter Richard Wyndham), "has always been a man of very strong antipathies. . . . The old man's dislike of his mother-in-law was very marked at the outset. It gradually extended to the whole Scottish nation." Dick's aunt explains why:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He became convinced that the Scottish People were aiming at a new world-hegemony, of an oppressive character that beggared description, with the noble weltstadt of Glasgow as its capital and main port, that was his persuasion, the fruit of a great deal of obscure and I fear not very creditable meditation. In every land they are to be found, he argued, in positions of the highest trust: England, he would doggedly affirm, is run by Scots&#x02014;that of course was why it was going to the dogs&#x02014;and he predicted freely that the day would come when all nations of the earth would eat porridge and worship in a kirk!

<p>
Transposing the object of Uncle James's phobia from Jews to Scots doesn't revoke the underlying basis of his fantasy, but the bathos helps diffuse it. After all, the English assert in many national jokes that Scots are mean and conniving, the English in turn playing the butt of other countries' jokes about generosity (just ask an American bartender how well English tourists tip). That Lewis cleverly displaces the phobic object in Uncle James's fantasy reappraises the potency of conspiracy theories, underscoring an obvious but still cogent point: they need no reliable basis in fact. The conflicts fueling these theories appear credible only because their advocates are impervious to evidence and contradiction. Rather than offering what Lewis called a "moralist['s]" 

<b></b>

critique of prejudice, then, <i>The Apes of God</i> satirizes how phobias with widespread political effects often stem from ridiculous notions.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  But while moralists, in Lewis's words, have "a strange propensity to side with the stronger and more orthodox party: they cannot even be depended on not to betray what is ostensibly their own client,"<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  his own brand of satire is iconoclastic. Highlighting the etiology of prejudice in a twofold joke (at Scots as well as at English perceptions of Scots), Lewis distinguishes between phobic objects and the fantasies that give them a strange patina of credibility, thereby forcing us to rethink conventional (egoic) patterns of identification.
</p>

<p>
According to Jameson, Lawrence's famous letter to Garnett "echoes Lewis' insistence on the nonmoral thrust of [satire's] externalizing discourse."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  This much seems substantively correct, though surely not as Lawrence's <i>echo</i> of Lewis. The former's letter dates from June 1914; Lewis's essay "Is Satire Real?"  began life two decades later as <i>Satire and Fiction,</i> a defensive appendage to <i>The Apes of God.</i> Still, as both writers address the amoral implications of impersonality, I'll conclude with Lawrence's letter on this subject: "Somehow&#x02014;that which is physic [<i>sic</i>]&#x02014;non-human, in humanity, is more interesting to me than the old-fashioned human element&#x02014;which causes one to conceive a character in a certain moral scheme and make him consistent. The certain moral scheme is what I object to."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Ursula, in <i>Women in Love,</i> shares this perspective, insisting, "the universe is non-human, thank God!" and observing with Birkin: "How stupid anthropomorphism is!" (<i>WL,</i> 343). One sees here, once more, how impersonality helped Lawrence's and Lewis's characters thwart an ego-based humanism intent on "painting the universe with [its] own image" (<i>WL,</i> 343). What intrigued both writers was the recurrence of "non-human" impulses in humanity, an effect betraying our steadfast presumptions about what it means to be a person. Nevertheless, considering the ego's resilience and the lengths to which Saki, Lawrence, and Lewis went to destroy its false assumptions about the world, we might still wonder whether their cure&#x02014;unrest&#x02014;ended up quelling or exacerbating the disease they so cleverly maligned.

The novel makes this point most intriguingly when Winifred Crich's rabbit, Bismarck, scores Gudrun's and Crich's forearms with its relentless kicking. Alluding unmistakably to the authoritarian prime minister of Prussia from 1862 until 1890 and founder and first chancellor of the German Empire, the narrator also can't resist attaching symbolism to this domestic drama, the "long red rent" of Gudrun's forearm apparently searing Crich's brain and "the surface of his ultimate consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond" (<i>WL,</i> 317). Although the narrator's language is undeniably pretentious here, the example makes clear that in <i>Women in Love</i> even specific allusions to the war become conduits to the metaphysical.

The persecution and killing of Jews is centuries old, and clearly did not begin with Saki or Edwardian England. I am suggesting, however, that Saki's frivolous depiction of anti-Semitic violence and his reliance on glee partly transformed this prejudice by binding it to noxious enjoyment. Despite the growing body of literary and political criticism on British anti-Semitism&#x02014;and increasingly sophisticated approaches to Saki&#x02014;"The Unrest-Cure" remains curiously overlooked.

In Philip Larkin's "Church Going" , a bored cyclist visits an empty church. "Hatless," he removes his cycle-clips as a gesture of "awkward reverence."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Uncertain of the names or meanings of various architectural features, he contemplates the church building with some confusion and wonders what the ultimate fate of churches will be:

<p class="noIndent">
Apart from a building in ruins, there will remain some who attend the church out of dependence on ritual or antiquarian excitement: "Christmas-addict[s]" and "ruin-bibber[s] randy for antique."

Yet Larkin's speaker wonders if the very last person to seek the church for "what it was" will be "my representative,"

Only in separation&#x02014;marriage, and birth,

<p class="noIndent">
The speaker concludes that the church still contains some sort of power, which he associates with the ritual function of "robing" compulsions as "destinies." The power connected with the church is one it receives from the dead and from its long association with central human life functions around which sacraments have developed. The poem's stately pace, pseudo-Spenserian stanza form, slant rhymes (idea/here), occasional feminine rhyme (surprising/wise in), rhetorical questions, and combination of high and low diction ("accoutred frowsty") give it an "awkward reverence" like that of its speaker. The poem itself has something of the quality of a ritual that persists even after its participants no longer accord it sacred meaning, and Larkin's self-consciously formal verse emphasizes this belatedness. The ironic use of the expression "Church Going" in the title indicates that in fact regular churchgoing (for worship) is no longer an option for the poet. The poet calls attention to his own ritual function when he writes of "mounting the lectern" to "peruse a few / Hectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce / 'Here endeth' much more loudly than I'd meant. / The echoes snigger briefly." The atmosphere of the church and his position at the lectern make his commentary on the end of religion more pronounced than he realizes: he lacks control of his own voice, and the echoes of his "here endeth" suggest the echoes of religious belief and ritual that continue to reverberate in his poem. The poet has here usurped the position of priest and thus arrogated to himself, bored and uninformed though he may be, the power to explain the significance of the hallowed site and to speak in some sense for the dead.
</p>

<p>
Larkin's poem describes a situation that fascinated many modern novelists as well as poets. In the works of several major modern novelists, lone male wanderers, often with touristic inclinations, visit churches and puzzle over the question of just what sort of power remains when even disbelief no longer motivates their view of religion. This little-noted topos embraces a wide range of modern heroes or antiheroes&#x02014;including Henry James's Lambert Strether, Marcel Proust's narrator, James Joyce's Leopold Bloom, Franz Kafka's Josef K., and (in a twist) Virginia Woolf's Miss La Trobe. The remarkable similarities among these scenes are all the more striking because several of their authors had not read each other's work.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In <i>The Gay Science</i>, Friedrich Nietzsche has his madman ask "What after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?"<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  The modernists seem almost ghoulishly attracted to these splendid tombs. T. E. Hulme complained that romanticism was "spilt religion" and proposed in its place a hard, dry classicism; churches seem to have maintained a fascination 

<b></b>

for a number of his modernist contemporaries precisely because they "held unspilt," in the words of Larkin's poem, some ritual or sacramental power that modern writers sought to channel into their own work.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This image of the church as container of a sacred essence, which the author seeks to transmit in the frail vessel of the novel or poem, seems to haunt the modernists. 
</p>

<p>
Among the major modernists, poets were more likely than novelists to espouse religious views or to link their work explicitly with the problem of religious experience. Thus, Wallace Stevens wrote as late as 1940, "It is a habit of mind with me to be thinking of some substitute for religion. . . . My trouble, and the trouble of a great many people, is the loss of belief in the sort of God in Whom we were all brought up to believe."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Poems frequently took the tone or even the form of prayers, as in well-known works by W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and W. H. Auden. Relatively little attention has been paid, however, to the fact that novelists of the period shared the poets' evident concern with religious experience.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The demands of the novel form and the agnostic views of many who practiced it seem to have meant that their search was perhaps less for a "substitute" for religion than for a satisfying explanation of the phenomena associated with religion. If poems frequently echoed their religious precursors, the novel tends to approach the sacred more obliquely. Its characteristic concerns are sociological or anthropological rather than spiritual.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Precisely the attempt to turn this sociological form toward a consideration of religious experience helped the modernists to transform the novel, even as the novel tended to retain some of the characteristics of the sociological study. The modernists' attempts to describe forms of experience that would traditionally have been called "religious" reflects a blurring of the lines between the sacred and the profane. Precisely as the modernists turn away from institutional religion, they seek forms of sacredness and possibilities of ritual in the profane world. To do so requires a reworking of the techniques of description that their forerunners had applied to this world. In particular, while modern novelists used techniques that had been associated in the realist novel with the accurate description of social phenomena, they tended to adapt these techniques under the influence of symbolism in order to describe more esoteric experiences and to challenge the realist novel's emphasis on the orderly workings of the visible world. Virginia Woolf described the work of modern fiction (specifically <i>Ulysses</i>) as a return to the "spiritual" in response to the "materialis[m]" of her Edwardian predecessors, and the modern novel is strikingly concerned with the spiritual rather than the material aspects of life.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
At the level of form, the blurring of sacred and profane can be understood in relation to Edmund Wilson's claim, in 1931, that "the literary history of our time is to a great extent that of the development of Symbolism and of its fusion or contact with Naturalism."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Where the naturalist impulse seeks to describe the secular world in all its objective randomness of detail, the symbolist impulse seeks a subjectively meaningful pattern to hold all these details together. On the one hand, the modern novel carries forward the secularizing tendencies represented by realism and naturalism; Emile Zola aimed to make "the experimental novel" into "a practical sociology" and "a help to political and economical sciences."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  On the other hand, its attempt to find 

<b></b>

some underlying pattern in such apparent randomness suggests a continuation of the symbolist project of "spiritualis[ing] literature," as described by Arthur Symons in 1899: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
as we brush aside the accidents of daily life, in which men and women imagine that they are alone touching reality, we come closer to humanity, to everything in humanity that may have begun before the world and may outlast it. . . . [In] speaking to us so intimately, so solemnly, as only religion had hitherto spoken to us, [literature] becomes itself a kind of religion, with all the duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The sense of the sacredness of the everyday in modernist novels grows in part out of the symbolist heritage, with its emphasis on hermetic meanings and its linguistic inventiveness, but it also results from an extension of naturalist techniques, which give increasing weight to quotidian details. Modernism thus involves both the extension of naturalist or realist techniques and their transformation or even reversal. By presenting life in all its randomness, the modern novel suggests that the randomness itself contains a pattern. 
</p>

<p>
The modernist churchgoing scene stages the confrontation of this underlying spiritualism in the novel with the apparently outmoded institutions of formal religious belief. Unlike Larkin, modern novelists seldom represent a church that is totally deserted. Rather, the churches visited by the male modernist protagonists tend to have small groups of primarily female worshippers, who are often the object of the protagonist's fantasies. Whether the novelist is Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish, the churches visited tend to be Catholic ones, often with rich historical associations that make them appropriate tourist destinations. Almost always, the protagonist's religion, social class, or background makes him feel like an outsider in the church. Frequently, he feels tired and enters the church looking for a place to sit down or rest. These churchgoing scenes seem in one sense to bespeak a process of secularization, since the protagonists of modern novels very seldom enter churches to worship God. However, the persistence of some sort of sacred power, associated variously with the regulation of sexuality (Larkin's "marriage, and birth"), the passage of time ("because it held unspilt / So long and equably . . ."), or the art of the church building ("this special shell"), suggests that "secularization" may be a misleading word for what happened to art's relation to the sacred in the twentieth century. Although the institutions represented by the church building may no longer hold much appeal, a residuum of the sacred seems to remain, and the modern novelist tries to control it. The question posed in each of these churchgoing scenes is whether the novel can in some way sate the "hunger in [one]self to be more serious" that Larkin associates with the sacred ground of the church&#x02014;whether the novel too can become a site that is "proper to grow wise in." 
</p>

<h4 class="bHead">

The Secularization Hypothesis
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
In an obvious sense, all of the church scenes I will discuss here deal with a process that has been called "secularization": the churchgoers are present primarily as tourists, not worshippers, and they feel alienated from the religious proceedings they witness. 

<b></b>

Yet these scenes also suggest the continuing significance of institutionalized religion for a variety of agnostic or atheistic modern authors and imply the importance for them of finding new ways to understand and interpret traditional religion. They also suggest a desire for alternative, more authentic forms of religious experience. To recognize the continued importance of religious experience for the modern novel requires a revision of traditional accounts of the novel and of its relationship to modernity. Theories of the novel have tended to emphasize the process of secularization. The most common narrative describes the rejection of earlier, religious forms (especially the epic), in which supernatural forces such as gods and monsters play a role, and their replacement by naturalistic techniques and attention to the empirically observable world. Walter Benjamin, Erich Auerbach, and Mikhail Bakhtin offer versions of this account, but Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs expressed it most succinctly when he wrote, in <i>The Theory of the Novel</i> , that the novel is "the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  This account of the novel relies on a much broader historical narrative, which I will call the "secularization hypothesis." The secularization hypothesis characterizes the emergence of modernity as the result of increasingly rational modes of thought and a rejection of belief in the supernatural. In 1918, alluding to Friedrich Schiller, Max Weber called this process "the disenchantment of the world."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  If the novel is indeed the art form of secularization, "the representative art-form of our age" in Luk&#x000E1;cs's words, and if modernity is indeed a secular age, then we could expect the modern novel to be doubly secular.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Many major novels of the early twentieth century do in fact seem to represent a "world that has been abandoned by God," inasmuch as virtually none of their characters expresses any concrete religious faith and no gods intervene in the course of the action.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Not only is religion basically absent as a force in the lives of characters in modern novels, but arguably the attack on the conventions of the nineteenth-century novel itself promotes a further step in secularization, namely the rejection or challenging of "grand narratives." The modernists reject the realist novel's alleged depiction of an orderly world, represented to us in an orderly manner by a narrator who speaks as if with the voice of God. They thus suggest that our faith in narrative may be a holdover of our earlier religious beliefs.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Yet, as the continual attraction to churchgoing scenes suggests, a sense of the sacred persists in these apparently godless novels. 
</p>

<p>
To understand this persistence requires a brief reexamination of the secularization hypothesis, which was receiving its most influential formulations precisely during the high phase of literary modernism. In the broad, unidirectional scheme in which the hypothesis is most often presented, the Victorian era appears as the age of faith and its crisis&#x02014;"the disappearance of God" or "God's funeral"&#x02014;while the twentieth century has already learned the lesson of the death of God and has no further need for him.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Victorian earnestness gives way to modern irony.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I would like to suggest that the rigid distinction between the Victorians and the moderns masks important continuities. The secularization hypothesis, which bears comparison with the "repressive hypothesis" identified and criticized by Michel Foucault in <i>The History of Sexuality,</i> contrasts the knowing, sophisticated twentieth century with the na&#x000EF;ve nineteenth. Foucault's inquiry 

<b></b>

into the twentieth century's continued "putting into discourse of sex" suggests a parallel inquiry into the concept of secularization.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  If the modern age has so comfortably dispensed with the supernatural, why do we continue to produce so much discourse about the need to abandon it, from Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud through the existentialists to the post-structuralist critique of "grand narratives" and the "metaphysics of presence"?<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  What accounts for the persistence of popular and literary fascination with the supernatural? Why does secular modern society produce so many vogues for Eastern religions, spiritualism, or the New Age? Why did the twentieth century produce so much religious fundamentalism in developing and developed societies alike? Without proposing a grand, Foucauldian historical framework for the "discourse about God," I would like to note that discourse about God and the supernatural (whether for or against) continues to proliferate. If God died in the nineteenth century, then he had an active afterlife in the twentieth. Nietzsche himself wrote that "After Buddha was dead, his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave&#x02014;a tremendous, gruesome shadow. God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown.&#x02014;And we&#x02014;we still have to vanquish his shadow, too."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In the first decades of the twentieth century, the question of how to cope with this shadow became an important concern of modern novelists and of a wide range of social scientists, including Weber, Emile Durkheim, William James, and Freud. As Raymond Aron has written of Weber, Durkheim, and Vilfrido Pareto, "It is not too much to say that the fundamental theme of their thought&#x02014;and, in their view, the fundamental cause of [the crisis of European society]&#x02014;was the relation between religion and science."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Within religious communities themselves, the early twentieth century witnessed a rejection of many of the premises of nineteenth-century liberal religious thought, which had sought an accommodation between traditional religion and modernity through what its critics saw as increasingly private and undemanding forms of religious observance that rejected specific religious dogmas in favor of broad ethical principles. Rather than accept the "modernization" of religion as an irresistible force, theologians as diverse as Karl Barth, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Franz Rosenzweig challenged the liberal consensus. In various ways, the new religious movements and ideas of the twentieth century rejected the notion that religious experience could be reconciled with nineteenth-century ideals such as historical progress and bourgeois culture, and that organized religions could, without tension, support the development of the liberal state. A renewed interest in the thought of S&#x000F8;ren Kierkegaard and Nietzsche among theologians pointed to the sense of dissatisfaction with optimistic liberal theology. In the Catholic Church, the "modernist" crisis exposed a deep rift between those who embraced modern science and Biblical criticism and the Church hierarchy, which excommunicated a number of modernists, notably Fathers Alfred Loisy and George Tyrrell, and instituted an oath against "modernism," a term which referred in most languages to the ultraliberal movement in the Catholic Church before it was ever applied to literary experiment. Within religious life, then, as well as in the social-scientific study of religion, the early twentieth century was a period not of widespread agnosticism and 

<b></b>

liberalism, but of heightened tension and conflict over the possibilities for a religious life in the modern world. The waves of anti-Semitism and then anticlericalism in France following the Dreyfus Affair showed that such conflict had political repercussions.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
More recently, a number of social scientists and philosophers have criticized the secularization hypothesis as oversimplifying the data. Opponents of secularization theory, who are legion, tend to note that in most of the world, outside western Europe, the twentieth century witnessed a great upsurge in religious fervor and that a majority of people even in apparently secular countries still claim to believe in God. An entirely different order of objection comes from those who observe the rise of "functional equivalents" of religion, that is, forms of social belonging (labor unions, ethnic groups, sports teams) or belief (nationalism, communism, consumerism, liberalism) that supply the role in modern life once played by the church.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The critique of the secularization hypothesis most relevant to the modern novel, however, involves a recognition of the increasingly private nature of religious belief and experience. The philosopher Charles Taylor, without denying that religion no longer plays its former role in the public sphere, has argued that the twentieth century witnessed a privatization of religious belief. With the decrease in church adherence among large groups of Western Europeans and international elites, people came to define their religion in increasingly personal terms and thus turned away from the public ritual and sacramental functions of churches. The attitude of "expressive individualism," influenced by romanticism and by consumer culture, insisted that, in Taylor's words, "The religious life or practice that I become part of not only must be my choice, but must speak to me; it must make sense in terms of my spiritual development as I understand this."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Modern spiritual life, then, is not secular per se, but the sacred no longer has its former public role. 
</p>

<p>
Whether we consider this privatization of religious experience another version of secularization or simply a transformation of religious life, it corresponds to the removal of ultimate values from the public sphere that Max Weber identified with the "disenchantment of the world." Weber wrote that 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Precisely the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life either into the transcendental realm of mystic life or into the brotherliness of direct and personal human relations. It is not accidental that our greatest art is intimate and not monumental, nor is it accidental that today [in 1918] only within the smallest and intimate circles, in personal human situations, in <i>pianissimo</i>, that something is pulsating that corresponds to the prophetic <i>pneuma</i> [spirit], which in former times swept through the great communities like a firebrand, welding them together.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
These words seem particularly applicable to the modern novel. The novel, of course, concerns itself largely with "direct and personal human relations," and modernism has long been understood as a "turning inward" of the novel, a heightened attention to the workings of the individual consciousness and to the most intimate of experiences. Yet the novels under consideration here are at the same time monumental. They tend to be very long. They make large claims for themselves and require an attention normally 

<b></b>

devoted only to holy scripture. As Franco Moretti has observed of <i>Ulysses</i> and several other major "modern epics," "These are not just any old books. They are monuments. Sacred texts that the modern West has subjected to a lengthy scrutiny, searching in them for its own secret."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  This seems equally true of some of the shorter texts of modernism, such as Kafka's parable "Before the Law." Modern novelists frequently imagined their own work as competing with churches. The narrator of Proust's <i>&#x000C0; la recherche du temps perdu</i> compares writing a novel to building a church and laments, "How many great cathedrals remain unfinished!"<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Joyce's Stephen Dedalus sets himself up as a "priest of the eternal imagination."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In Henry James's first novel, the heroine writes that "To go into most of the churches is like reading some better novel than I find most novels."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In each case, the novelist suggests that novels take the place, in modern life, of churches. However, unlike attending a church service, writing and reading a novel are fundamentally private activities. The church scene plays such an important role in the modern novel, I will argue, because it stages the encounter between the great public monuments of Christian faith and the intimate monuments of an increasingly privatized form of religious experience, modern novels.

Scenes of Churchgoing
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The churchgoing scenes in modernist novels offer opportunities for the novelist to claim a form of monumentality for his or her own work. The modernists develop highly formalized sets of linguistic conventions that depart markedly from the novel's traditional method of narrating events through the use of mainly referential language. Each novelist tends to develop his or her own style in such a heightened fashion that it is easy, for example, to tell a text by Kafka apart from one by Proust (even in translation); in the attempt to create a sense of the ultimate reality behind everyday life, the very language of the modern novel thus becomes ritualized.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The modernist novel tends, too, by the difficulty and self-consciousness of its literary style, to call attention to the problem of its own interpretation. Scenes of churchgoing are apt especially to highlight hermeneutical questions, both because the protagonists of modern novels often expend considerable energy on interpreting the church rituals they witness and because such scenes seem to announce themselves as moments susceptible of allegorical interpretation. These churchgoing scenes seem indeed to offer themselves up for an interpretation loosely modeled on the fourfold exegetical technique of the medieval allegorists, which I am adapting somewhat differently than Fredric Jameson does in <i>The Political Unconscious</i>.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  At the literal level of the motif, the protagonists of these modern novels puzzle over the monuments they encounter. Just as Larkin lingers over the "brass and stuff / Up at the holy end" of the church, and wonders whether the roof is "new or restored," the modern novelists focus their attention on church architecture and terminology, as a way perhaps of avoiding theological questions, but also in order to transfer questions about ultimate meaning from the ethereal spiritual realm to the solid world of architectural forms and technical language. This motif offers an opportunity for the celebration of a highly ritualized language, so that even the literal level 

<b></b>

of the text provides a sort of ritualistic experience. On a formal level, the texts represent a variety of possible relationships between the narrator and the protagonists; all involve some modernist development of the realist technique of free indirect discourse, which links the highly ritualized use of language in the novels to the problem of understanding the experience of the novel's protagonist. On a thematic or moral level, each of the texts seems to explore the limits of the protagonist's ability to sympathize with others, and especially with the female penitents he encounters in the church. This question is clearly linked to the problem of the relationship between narrator and protagonist; both are versions of the problem of other minds. Finally, on the eschatological plane, each of these texts gestures, though in varying degrees, to the typological imagination of the modernists, their tendency to draw parallels between the lives of their own middle-class heroes and the dramas of the Bible and of world history. These four levels of interpretation may not apply equally to each of the texts, but the central concerns of adapting language to describe a heightened form of experience, addressing the narrator's relationship to the protagonist and the protagonist's relationship to other characters, and the place of the churchgoing scene in a broad mythical or historical pattern all tend to resurface at particularly powerful moments in many modernist novels. Although some of these churchgoing scenes may seem minor, I will argue that each plays a crucial role in the development of the novel in which it appears.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Notre Dame Cathedral around the turn of the century provides a good first case of modernist churchgoing. Although deprived of any religious consolation in his confrontation with the alien mores of Paris, Lambert Strether, in Henry James's <i>The Ambassadors</i> , becomes a haunter of churches: "I'm terrible, in general, for churches. The old women who live in them all know me; in fact I'm already myself one of the old women."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Strether undergoes a significant change of heart about the apparently wicked Madame de Vionnet upon seeing her praying in Notre Dame. The scene takes place at the very beginning of the second volume of <i>The Ambassadors,</i> a turning point in the novel's plot, and it echoes an equally crucial scene in James's early novel <i>The American</i> (1876-77). Strether begins the episode conscious of his exclusion from the Catholic Church: "The great church had no altar for his worship, no direct voice for his soul; but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity; for he could feel while there what he could n't elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned" (<i>A,</i> 2:5). Strether's contemplation of his position at Notre Dame typifies the "double consciousness" that James has ascribed to him early in the novel: there is, as James writes, "detachment in his zeal and curiosity in his indifference" (<i>A,</i> 1:5). Strether has "observation for his pastime," but he spends much of the time observing his own thought processes. James represents all the hesitations, evasions, and self-corrections typical of Strether's halfhearted struggle to escape from his own subjectivity. James's elaborate development of indirect discourse sets up a complex interaction between narratorial statements and Strether's own thoughts, in which Strether sometimes seems to be correcting the narrator's comments about him and James's account of Strether's situation can only with difficulty be disentangled from Strether's own contemplation of it.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Like a student under the charm of a museum, Strether attends to the architectural features of Notre Dame: "He trod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the clustered chapels of the east end . . ." (<i>A,</i> 2:5). However, he seems rather more interested in studying those visitors to the church for whom it retains its theological significance, the "res of mystery and anxiety . . . whom, with observation for his pastime, he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice" (<i>A,</i> 2:5). He is as interested in anthropology as in church architecture. The episode introduces some subtle and ancient stereotypes about Catholicism on which a number of modernists will draw. The plural character of Notre Dame's "altars" and "clustered chapels" suggests the "far-reaching, quivering groping tentacles" that Strether has imagined earlier in the novel as part of his friend Waymarsh's view of the Catholic Church. The novel plays on these tentacles too in the image of Madame de Vionnet as having a mind with "doors as numerous as the many-tongued cluster of confessionals at Saint Peter's" (<i>A,</i> 1:230). Multiple tongues and quivering tentacles seem to lie in wait among the "clustered chapels" and "many altars" of the cathedral. James also calls attention to the lighting effects of Notre Dame: "Justice was outside, in the hard light, and injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars" (<i>A,</i> 2:5). Strether distances himself from the worshippers in the Cathedral, the "real refugee[s]," but he longs at some level to participate in their rites. He sits in the choir as if he might like to sing a hymn, and he goes on to meditate at some length on absolution, a sacrament alien to his own (Protestant) religious tradition.
</p>

<p>
In an innocently voyeuristic mood, Strether observes a lady in a chapel who seems to be praying: "She reminded our friend . . . of some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story, something he had heard, read, something that, had he had a hand for drama, he might himself have written, renewing her courage, renewing her clearness, in splendidly-protected meditation" (<i>A,</i> 2:6--7). In a wonderful example of "delayed decoding" that preres the famous recognition scene by the river later in the novel, the worshipper that he has observed turns out to be Madame de Vionnet, and this encounter proves a turning point in the novel's plot.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The central themes of the modernist churchgoing scene are present in this episode: Strether's attempt to understand the frame of mind of the worshippers, James's play with the relationship between the narrator's observations and Strether's thoughts, and even a sort of typology whereby Strether associates the real Notre Dame with the imagined one of Victor Hugo. Although the church itself has only residual theological meaning for Strether personally, as a setting for historical romance it allows him to transre a woman whom he admires but mistrusts into a splendid heroine. Like Larkin's speaker, he studies the cathedral's architecture, but he is drawn to the church largely by an awkward reverence for the past and for the residues of sacramental power to be found there. Strether's own "small struggle" becomes the monumental subject of <i>The Ambassadors</i> as a whole, and the scene of his encounter with Notre Dame emphasizes both his distance from institutional religion and the continuities between his spiritual crises and those undergone by the "real refugee[s]," the still-believing Catholics (<i>A,</i> 2:4-5).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The architectural motif is more pronounced in Marcel Proust's <i>&#x000C0; la recherche du temps perdu</i> (1913-27; <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>), whose narrator is a serious churchgoer with a taste for Romanesque and Gothic architecture inspired in part by Ruskin. Two churches dominate the narrator's memories of summers in Combray and color his later aesthetic and social theories. Each of them brings the romance of the Middle Ages to the narrator's childhood and inspires one of his earliest sexual fantasies. The narrator's family would attend mass at the fictional church of Saint-Hilaire, with its array of aristocratic associations. The church contains the tombs of the abbots of Combray and the sons of Louis the German ("in porphyry and enamelled copper"), two famous tapestries in silk and wool representing the coronation of Esther, and stained-glass windows depicting medieval noblemen and battles (<i>RTP,</i> 1:65).<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Proust seems to take a certain pleasure in the accuracy of his technical descriptions of these works of art, several of which connect the church to the noble family of the region, the Guermantes: their ancestor Gilbert the Bad is the subject of one of the stained-glass windows and an earlier countess of Guermantes is said to have served as a model for Esther in the tapestries. For the narrator, this connection to a legendary history gives the church its "supernatural" power. The narrator is introduced into the passage describing this church in a subordinate clause, one of many in a sentence 384 words long that has only one independent clause.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  This introduction dramatizes grammatically how the narrator's tiny self is overwhelmed by the splendor of the church:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I used to advance into the church, as we made our way to our seats, as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement in a rock, a tree, a pond, the tangible traces of the little people's supernatural passage&#x02014;all this made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town: an edifice occupying, so to speak, a four-dimensional space&#x02014;the name of the fourth being Time . . .

<p class="noIndent">
Immediately upon being introduced, the narrator enters into a sort of epic simile, comparing himself to a peasant amazed at the evidence of the passage of fairies. In order to explain his own feelings in encountering the church, the narrator has to reach for a simile referring to an older form of supernatural belief. The narrator continually seeks parallels between the Biblical story of Esther, the legendary history of the Guermantes family, and his own mundane bourgeois life, just as he imagines his own relation to Swann in typological terms: Swann represents the Old Testament, the narrator the New. Proust's novel continually emphasizes the magical element of our relations with others and with the past. Although the apse of the church is "so crude, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of religious feeling," and its exterior suggests that it is a "simple citizen of Combray" like the adjacent buildings, the narrator surrounds the church building itself with an aura of sacredness associated with his fantasies about the Guermantes family (<i>RTP,</i> 1:66-7).<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The supernatural quality of the church of Saint-Hilaire has less to do with its sacred function than with its place in history; the historic character of the church reminds the narrator of a fairy world of magic rather than of anything Christian. However, history, legend, and Biblical narrative all tend to merge in this passage, just as the colors of the Esther tapestries melt into one another. The 

<b></b>

narrator imagines that the church will "endure for centuries after my death as it had for centuries before my birth" (<i>RTP,</i> 3:726).<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  During the First World War, however, the Baron de Charlus will inform the narrator that the French and English have destroyed the church because its tower was being used as an observatory by the Germans, who have occupied Combray (<i>RTP,</i> 3:822; <i>ARTP,</i> 4:374). 
</p>

<p>
The historical associations of Saint-Hilaire contribute to the narrator's fascination with the current Duchess of Guermantes, who one day appears in the family chapel and seems to the narrator to be watching him with special attention: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[Her] smile fell upon me, who had never taken my eyes off her. And remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during mass, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, I said to myself, "She must have taken notice of me." I fancied that I had found favour in her eyes, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would perhaps feel sad that evening, at Guermantes, because of me. And at once I fell in love with her. . . .

Although the actual appearance of the Duchess rather disappoints the narrator, since it has more in common with that of her stylish bourgeois contemporaries than with the tapestries or stained-glass windows in which her ancestors are depicted, his fantasies about her aristocratic lineage manage to transform this unremarkable-looking woman into a sort of fairy princess. 
</p>

<p>
The aristocracy has its historical romance; so too does the peasantry, which the narrator associates with the other important church of his childhood, Saint-Andr&#x000E9;-des-Champs, between Combray and M&#x000E9;s&#x000E9;glise.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Proust writes: "How French that church was! Over its door the saints, the chevalier kings with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Fran&#x000E7;oise" (<i>RTP,</i> 1:164).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  The narrator frequently imagines the family servant Fran&#x000E7;oise as a typical medieval peasant transplanted to late-nineteenth-century France. Like her, Th&#x000E9;odore the grocer's boy, though himself a hard case, seems filled with the spirit of Saint-Andr&#x000E9;-des-Champs. When he helps the narrator's invalid aunt rearrange her head on a pillow, he displays "the same na&#x000EF;ve and zealous mien as the little angels in the bas-reliefs who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the swooning Virgin" (<i>RTP,</i> 1:165).<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  While on a walk with his family, the narrator takes shelter on the porch of Saint-Andr&#x000E9;-des-Champs and compares its statues to "some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence . . . seemed deliberately intended to enable us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art" (<i>RTP,</i> 1:166).<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  He develops a desire to clasp in his arms a "peasant-girl from M&#x000E9;s&#x000E9;glise," but it remains unfulfilled (<i>RTP,</i> 1:171).<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  On his solitary walks, "I might go as far as the porch of Saint-Andr&#x000E9;-des-Champs: never did I find there the peasant girl whom I should not have failed to meet had I been with my grandfather and thus unable to engage her in conversation" (<i>RTP,</i> 1:173).<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Proust's treatment of the church of Saint-Andr&#x000E9;-des-Champs emphasizes the role of art in constructing the sacred. If the church building seems to elevate the local peasantry through its art, it also takes some of its sacred character from those very 

<b></b>

peasants and their immemorial way of life, including the rituals such as weddings and funerals later mentioned by Larkin. The fantasy of the "peasant-girl from M&#x000E9;s&#x000E9;glise," like James's scene in Notre Dame, links a fascination with the sacred to sublimated sexual desire and suggests the role of such desire in artistic creation. 
</p>

<p>
Sexual desire is hardly sublimated at all in James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> . In the "Lotus-Eaters" episode, Leopold Bloom drops in to All Hallows Church after picking up a letter from Martha Clifford, with whom he is carrying on a flirtatious correspondence, and before visiting the Leinster Street Turkish Baths. Upon reading a notice of a sermon by a Jesuit missionary, Bloom imagines the reactions of the "heathen Chinee" and "blacks" with "blub lips."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Despite having been baptized three times (once by a Catholic priest [<i>U,</i> 558]), Bloom, with his Jewish ancestry, still experiences the Church as an outsider, and he sympathizes with the Chinese: "Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for them" (<i>U,</i> 65). As he observes a mass, Bloom tends to mix theological and sexual associations: "Nice discreet place to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven" (<i>U,</i> 66). Set next to Proust's gargantuan sentences, the typical phrase from Bloom's stream of consciousness, at two to eight words, resembles a Lilliputian among the Brobdingnagians.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Like James's Strether, Bloom admires the practice of confession, which he interprets in somewhat sadomasochistic fashion: "Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to" (<i>U,</i> 68).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Here as elsewhere Joyce makes explicit the link between sexual dynamics and sacred practices that both James and Proust imply. For Bloom, the very sacrament of Penance fulfils the sexual fantasies of women and priests. Joyce's novel is pervaded by Bloom's efforts to identify sympathetically with the thoughts of the women about whom he fantasizes, a desire that reaches its most complete expression in the "Nausicaa" episode. Rather than simply fantasizing about women in church, Bloom likes to fantasize about their fantasies. In this he resembles Proust's narrator, who falls in love with Madame de Guermantes because he imagines she loves him. Indeed, this quality of sympathetic fantasy is a central concern of the modern novel. Since the minds of others are never quite known directly in modernism, and since even conversation is frequently misleading, the characters and indeed narrators of the novels attempt incessantly to imagine the thought processes of other characters.
</p>

<p>
Bloom's particular skill at sympathetic fantasy explains his acumen as an observer of Catholic ritual. Like Larkin's ill-informed tourist, Bloom has some difficulty with church-related terminology; he is fuzzy on details about the host and on Latin acronyms. Nonetheless, he has a pretty clear theory of the spirit of Catholicism. Like an amateur anthropologist who has descended from outer space with the vaguest knowledge of Catholic theology, he contemplates the sacraments of the Eucharist and Penance and attempts to explain their power. Bloom arrives at a workable theory of the social function of the mass not all that far from the attitudes of contemporary social scientists:

Some arcane knowledge is smuggled into the narrative under the guise of colloquial language. The phrase "hokypoky penny a lump," for example, refers to a late-nineteenth-century children's rhyme about a type of ice cream, but "hokypoky" is also a variant of <i>hocus-pocus,</i> a term for deception and false magic, associated by probably false etymology with anti-Catholic ridicule of the Latin mass: <i>hoc est corpus</i>. In this apparently childish allusion, then, Bloom or Joyce combines the uncertain and largely forgotten reference to the mass in the name of the ice cream with the idea of the host as a sort of lollipop to make grown children happy.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Bloom himself, like Strether and like Proust's narrator, tends to feel lonely, but if all three are the victims of anomie, each can appreciate in his own way the function of religion in encouraging social cohesion. For Bloom, the Church and its sacraments seem to offer a model of such cohesion in which he would not mind participating, if only his nature and intellect tended that way ("Thing is if you really believe in it" [<i>U,</i> 66]). Like other modernist heroes, he seems excluded from full participation in the mysteries of the Church. 
</p>

<p>
The theme of the Passover, introduced in this episode for the first time in <i>Ulysses</i> by reference to the matzoth, contributes to a central symbolic aspect of the novel of which Bloom remains mostly in ignorance, the typological parallel between himself and Jesus.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Bloom recognizes the continuity of the mass with the Passover seder, but he probably does not realize that in Christian typological reading, the Passover is a central Old Testament type for the resurrection.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The christological dimension of Bloom's day receives one of its most memorable formulations in the final lines of this passage. Bloom tries to remember the meanings of "I. N. R. I." ("Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews") and "I. H. S." ("Jesus the Savior of Man," but also interpreted as "In Hoc Signo"&#x02014;"In this sign [thou shalt conquer]").<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  "I. H. S." amounts for Bloom to a sort of existential comment on the nature of human life, and Joyce's punctuation nicely captures Bloom's self-correcting interpretation of the acronym "I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is." Bloom seems to emphasize the stoical conception of life as suffering over the Church's doctrine of original sin, but his worldview has room for both. He then remembers I. N. R. I., "iron nails ran in," an intensely material way of describing the Passion, both funny for its attempt to find a common-sense English meaning for the Latin acronym, and terribly sad in the immediacy of the image of Christ's suffering, recollecting the sheer brutality and mockery of the crucifixion. Over the course of June 16, 1904, Bloom will have his messiah fantasies, and he will commit a few sins, but he will also suffer, and the image of the crucifixion will remain a powerful focus for this suffering. The All Hallows episode may appear to have some of the qualities of a set piece, a simple way station on Bloom's odyssey, but the problems it raises are crucial to the entire novel. The listing in "Ithaca" of the rites in which Bloom has participated during the day suggests that <i>Ulysses</i> may be read in terms of a search for alternatives to the mass, from the mock mass of Buck Mulligan with which the novel opens,

through Bloom's unconscious "burnt offering" of the pork kidney, to the black mass of "Circe" (<i>U,</i> 599).

One of the bleaker church visits in the modern novel belongs, not surprisingly, to Franz Kafka. In the climactic penultimate chapter<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  of <i>Der Proce&#x000DF;</i> (written 1914-15, published 1925; <i>The Trial</i>), Josef K. is asked by the manager of the bank where he works as a clerk to escort an Italian client on a tour of the town's cathedral. Kafka of course was a Jew, but K. has no apparent biographical reason for his alienation from the Church. Where Strether and Bloom sought a little calm, and Proust's narrator worshipped art, however, K. only enters the cathedral on unpleasant business, possibly sent there as a subterfuge by agents of the Court (his girlfriend Leni tells him "they're goading you").<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  He arrives at the cathedral in pouring rain; the Italian does not show up; the Cathedral is almost deserted: "K. went through both of the side aisles and saw no one but an old woman muffled in a shawl who was kneeling before a Madonna with adoring eyes" (<i>T,</i> 203-4).<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The prayerful old woman, vaguely associated with the Madonna, does not hold the same attraction or comfort for Josef K. that Madame de Vionnet, the Duchesse de Guermantes, or even Joyce's masochistic penitents do for K.'s counterparts. Her presence seems almost vestigial. The sexual charge that K. has frequently found from associating with women during crucial moments of his trial, and which may have interfered with his defense, seems drained here too. 
</p>

<p>
Formerly a member of the "Society for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments," K. seems closer to Proust's narrator than to Leopold Bloom in his knowledge of art and architecture, but he cannot indulge his connoisseurship (<i>T,</i> 199).<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  He lacks the technical terms in Italian for his assignment as tour guide, and he spends the morning before his visit "copying from the dictionary various unfamiliar words which he would need in his tour of the Cathedral" (<i>T,</i> 202).<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Furthermore, the cathedral is dark, and K. must use his pocket flashlight to examine a picture of "Christ being laid in the tomb" (<i>T,</i> 205).<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  The flashlight contrasts nicely with the candles in James's Notre Dame and the light of the stained-glass windows in Proust. A verger appears and voicelessly gestures for K. to move in "some vaguely indicated direction" (<i>T,</i> 206).<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  K. disregards him, but a sign and a light above the smaller of two pulpits indicate that a sermon is about to be preached. The old woman worshipper is nowhere to be seen. While K. contemplates his escape, the cathedral seems to grow huge: "the size of the Cathedral struck him as bordering on the limit of what human beings could bear" (<i>T,</i> 208).<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  K. grabs his album of tourist sights and prepares to leave. A priest, who has climbed the small pulpit, addresses him: "Josef K.!" In a moment that exemplifies K.'s tendency to set traps for himself, he hesitates about whether to leave: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

K. paused and stared at the ground before him. For the moment he was still free, he could continue on his way and vanish through one of the [three] small, dark, wooden doors that faced him at no great distance. It would simply indicate that he had not understood the call, or that he had understood it and did not care. But if he were to turn round he would be caught, for that would amount to an admission that he had understood it very well, that he was really the person addressed, and that he was ready to obey. Had the priest called his name a second time K. would certainly have gone on, but as everything 

<b></b>

remained silent, though he stood waiting a long time, he could not help turning his head a little just to see what the priest was doing.

Kafka's short but syntactically complex sentences express the paranoid logic of K.'s position. Kafka's syntax is not particularly difficult to follow, but it is relentless. The last sentence quoted shows his difference from Proust: there is a great deal of subordination going on here, but it is tightly controlled and signaled mainly by conjunctions, and it creates the sense not of a flowing stream into which any observation might plunge but of a tightly enclosed space in which the options for action are rigorously limited. Indeed it describes a moment in which K., like a pathetic Orpheus, cannot help looking back at the priest who has hailed him. The narrator's relationship to K. seems even closer than James's to Strether; it is virtually impossible to distinguish a separate voice of narrative commentary from K.'s own analysis of his situation, self-contradictory as that analysis frequently is. K. seems the extreme form of Strether's unhappy consciousness. 
</p>

<p>
Just as Strether thought to escape from his problems by entering Notre Dame, but instead encountered them there in the person of Madame de Vionnet, K. discovers that the Cathedral is only an extension of the Court. The priest introduces himself as the prison chaplain and asks,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

"What is that in your hand? Is it a prayer book?" "No," replied K., it is an album of sights worth seeing in the town." "Lay it down," said the priest. K. threw it away so violently that it flew open and slid some way along the floor with disheveled leaves. (<i>T,</i> 210)<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
The tension evident in each of the churchgoing scenes between the possibility of seeking spiritual solace in the church and the touristic impulse to view it as an outsider, a sort of amateur anthropologist, receives its sharpest expression here in the Priest's command to lay down the book and the image of the book's disheveled leaves as K. throws it away violently. The action preres Larkin's poet's surprise at the loudness of his own voice. Some power in the church causes K. to lose control of his own actions, particularly symbolic actions like this one. The scene concludes with the Priest relating to K. the parable "Before the Law," which reveals how the Court, with its legal texts, takes the place of the Church and its scriptures.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  Strether was comforted to imagine that justice and injustice were equally absent from the aisles of Notre Dame, but the perverse justice of the Court follows K. everywhere. "Before the Law" is of course also an important text about the power of literary interpretation, in which interpretation itself is seen as a sort of sacred task. As a commentary on Kafka's own text, it emphasizes the modernist location of questions of ultimate meaning not in public rituals but in multiply interpretable literary works.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

Not all modernist churchgoers are male. Virginia Woolf's last novel, <i>Between the Acts</i> (published posthumously in 1941), provides a sort of culmination of the modernist churchgoing scene. Here, near the end of a novel that describes the mounting of a rather idiosyncratic pageant about British history, the playwright and director Miss La Trobe leaves the stage vacant. The pageant itself is a sort of ritual, held annually in the 

<b></b>

village. This year, as the audience reads in the program, "The profits are to go to a fund for installing electric light in the Church." Here, of course, the modernist tradition of describing the subtle lighting effects inside the church, pricked already in a way by Josef K.'s flashlight, is almost parodied by the plan to electrify the Church. Woolf describes the audience's reaction: "Where was the Church? Over there. You could see the spire among the trees."<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  In fact, we never see the inside of the church in <i>Between the Acts</i>, but the clearing where the play is performed is described as "an open-air cathedral" and the barn, where refreshments are served, is "as old as the church, and built of the same stone," although it has no steeple (<i>BA,</i> 36, 15). Woolf tells us more about the architecture of this barn than about the church, and this seems almost to prere Larkin's reference to his church as "this accoutred, frowsty barn." In <i>Between the Acts,</i> the local clergyman, "The Rev. G. W. Streatfield, M. A.," does attempt to offer an interpretation of Miss La Trobe's pageant, but his understanding of it is as comically inadequate as that of Mrs. Mayhew, who thinks how she would conclude the pageant: "a Grand Ensemble. Army; Navy; Union Jack; and behind them perhaps&#x02014;Mrs. Mayhew sketched what she would have done had it been her pageant&#x02014;the Church. In cardboard. One window, looking east, brilliantly illuminated to symbolize&#x02014;she could work that out when the time came" (<i>BA,</i> 101, 96). The Church, whose brilliant illumination is not only Mrs. Mayhew's ideal but also the literal goal of the entire proceeding, is reduced to a cardboard cutout, glimpsed through the trees, not clearly symbolizing anything. Although this passage seems to indicate Mrs. Mayhew's foolishness, it also dramatizes how the entire novel poses the problem of infinitely deferred interpretive possibilities: what sense are we to make of British history and of the Church's role in it?
</p>

<p>
Woolf focuses her attention on the uncomfortable reaction of the audience to the ending of the pageant with an empty stage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"Ourselves . . . ." They returned to the programme. But what could she know about ourselves? The Elizabethans, yes; the Victorians, perhaps; but ourselves; sitting here on a June day in 1939&#x02014;it was ridiculous. "Myself"&#x02014;it was impossible. Other people, perhaps . . . Cobbet of Cobbs Corner; the Major; old Bartholomew; Mrs. Swithin&#x02014;them, perhaps. But she won't get me&#x02014;no, not me. The audience fidgeted. Sounds of laughter came from the bushes. But nothing whatsoever appeared on the stage.

The distinctive feature of Woolf's prose style here is her elaboration of the sympathetic fantasy seen already in the male protagonists of earlier modern novels. Woolf gives us access not only to the stream of consciousness of her protagonists, Miss La Trobe and Isabella Oliver, but also of the anonymous members of the audience, who deny that they can be summarized as easily as the Victorians or the Elizabethans&#x02014;"she won't get me&#x02014;no, not me"&#x02014;then of particular audience members, minor characters like Mrs. Mayhew, and finally of Miss La Trobe herself.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  Miss La Trobe has planned to confront the audience with "present time: reality," but she mutters, "reality too strong." In an excess of sympathy, "She felt everything they felt," and she imagines herself like the dancing girl in the Hans Christian Andersen story, with blood pouring 

<b></b>

from her shoes. Here the question of the protagonist's sympathy with the worshippers merges with the problem of the narrator's sympathy with her characters, and Miss La Trobe seems to stand in for the author: "Curse 'em!," she thinks, "Audiences were the devil." The novel reaches its climax as a storm breaks and the rain pours, "like all the people in the world weeping. Tears. Tears. Tears" (<i>BA,</i> 96). The line from Walt Whitman's "Sea-Drift" functions as a sort of chorus here, and the passage has moved from the reaction of the audience as a whole through the imagined reaction of individual audience members and that of the author Miss La Trobe to a more universal level. More than the other modernists, Woolf's emphasis falls on the status of the church as absent center and its failure to unite the community, even when the occasion of that community's gathering is a church pageant. In this respect, Woolf shares some of Larkin's coldly elegiacal attitude to the church; it is not a living option for her. Yet, the tone is elegiacal nonetheless, and not simply satirical; throughout Woolf's work, we continue to hear what Matthew Arnold, almost a century earlier, had called "the melancholy, long, withdrawing roar" of "the Sea of Faith." The setting of the pageant in June 1939 of course calls attention to the fact that another storm is brewing across the channel, "where ignorant armies clash by night."<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The churchgoing scenes I have analyzed here range from Lambert Strether's vision of the Notre Dame of romance, seen by the "brightness" of the candles in its "many altars," to the cardboard cutout of a Church that is not even included in Miss La Trobe's pageant, the proceeds of which will go towards providing electric light for the local church, whose inside we never see. <i>The Ambassadors</i> was published in 1902, <i>Between the Acts</i> in 1941. Perhaps the most obvious precursor of such novels is Hardy's <i>Jude the Obscure</i> of 1896.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  What marks Hardy's stonemason off from James's Strether, apart from the arbitrary turn of the century, is that Jude hopes for some meaning and guidance from Christminster and from the church; the discovery that the church is in fact empty and that religious codes are merely expressions of narrow social views of morality causes a great mournfulness for Jude and for Hardy.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Mournfulness, however, plays little role in the modernist churchgoing scene, in which no one particularly expects any answers from God in the first place. This may at some level confirm the traditional contrast between Victorian earnestness and modernist irony, but these churchgoing scenes suggest that much remains at stake in the modernists' struggle to "vanquish God's shadow." If the beginning of the modernist period can be marked by the fact that Strether comes to the church not to rebuild it but to admire it, not to worship but to observe the worshippers, then its end can be seen in the fact that Larkin's speaker in "Church Going" enters a church from which even the worshippers have disappeared.

Religious Experience in the Modernist Novel
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The sheer abundance of churchgoing scenes in the modernist novel suggests the need to rethink the secularization hypothesis that has (sometimes unconsciously) dominated so much literary criticism. The case of Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> shows the paradoxical 

<b></b>

character of the modern novel's encounter with the sacred. T. S. Eliot interpreted <i>Ulysses</i> as struggling against the effects of secularization by establishing a "mythical method": "a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy that is contemporary history."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  However, most critics have rejected Eliot's interpretation, and the predominant way of reading <i>Ulysses</i> has been to see it as a debunking or parody of myth. As George Orwell put it, "What Joyce is saying is 'Here is life without God. Just look at it!'"<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Yet this eminently modern novel, presumably the secular product of a secular age, is peculiarly God-haunted. Even though Bloom feels excluded from the mysteries of the Church, <i>Ulysses</i> provides other sites of quasi-sacred ritual in which he can fulfill his religious impulses. Joyce of course begins the novel with a mock mass&#x02014;Buck Mulligan treats his morning shave as a sacrament, his shaving bowl as a chalice, and intones "<i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i>" (<i>U</i>, 3). Yet Buck's mocking attitude toward the sacraments seems less adequate, ultimately, than the unconscious reverence of Bloom himself: when Bloom burns his breakfast kidney, he is unknowingly reenacting ancient Hebrew rites.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  Such allusions, though still ironic (especially since in this case it is a pork kidney), highlight the ritualistic character of many of our daily activities: cooking breakfast, reading the mail, feeding the cat, appeasing a grumpy spouse. The novel confers a sacramental quality on these mundane tasks. As Robert Alter has put it, Joyce "sacralize[s] the profane."<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This sense of the sacredness of everyday life, and of the need to create more intimate, modern rituals in place of the great public rites of the Church, can be observed continually in the modern novel. What ultimately characterizes "modernism" in the novel is not a time period or a set of thematic concerns, but the fact that in modernism the form and presuppositions of the novel itself become a subject of experiment. Characteristic of the modern novel are: an intensive concern with the workings of consciousness or the inner life; self-consciousness about the literary quality or style of language used, in opposition to the earlier tendency to make the prose of novels generally referential; a skepticism of traditional, received plots; a preference for antiheroes or at any rate heroes who do not resemble the heroes of earlier novels; the use of private or esoteric symbolism; a tendency to experiment with narrative devices; nonlinear representation of time; ambiguous or unstably ironic representation of events; exploration of previously taboo subject matters, such as adultery, homosexuality, or the workings of the digestive system; and representation of rapid social changes, including feminism and the effects of the suffrage movement, the rise of advertising and mass culture, and the shock of the First World War. These characteristics refer to several elements of the novel: its subject matter, its plot, its formal qualities, and the social content linked to the period in which modern novels were being written. Of course, some characteristically modern concerns can be found in earlier novels, whether in Fran&#x000E7;ois Rabelais's interest in digestive functions, Laurence Sterne's play with narrative conventions, Charles Dickens's complicated plots, or Gustave Flaubert's subtle irony. Modernism in the novel is best described as the convergence of all these factors, and their prevalence among a wide range of writers, not just a radical few. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The features on this list contribute in various ways to the attempt to give literature, as Symons put it, "all the duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual." The modernists' concern with the inner life often suggests a modern form of mysticism. Their elevated attention to language and their use of symbolism both contribute to the awareness of planes of experience not normally recognized in everyday life. Their search for new narrative devices and plots combines an aspiration to grander meanings than those of the realist novel (the allusions to scripture, the Greek myths, the classical unities) with much more mundane subject matter (a day in the life of an advertising canvasser or a society hostess). The quest for new forms of plot and new types of hero underwrites the modernists' characteristic concern with authenticity in the representation of experience. Unstable irony, ambiguity, and the concern with nonlinear time all challenge realistic methods that represent the world as ordered by the secular forces of a forward-moving history. The concern with taboo subject matters of course bespeaks a challenge to the border between the sacred and the profane. The overwhelming sense that modernism breaks with the past, and that the twentieth century faces radically new concerns, can be attributed to any number of historical causes, but it suggests the need for new values and it chimes in with the sense of contemporary theologians and social scientists that a new form of religion was needed for the modern age. Each of these features serves many functions other than those I have mentioned, and I do not wish to suggest that modernism in literature results solely from a response to a religious crisis. However, the distinctive characteristics of the modern novel all seem to implicate some central concern with the question of the sacred and its forms in modern life. The formal features of the modern novel, in particular, tend to contribute to the sense that its task is both to represent the profane world as fully as possible and to find in it mysteries of a sacred character.
</p>

<p>
William James made an important contribution to the developing social sciences of religion when he proposed to define religion "in the most general terms possible" as consisting of "the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The res under consideration here did not necessarily believe in such an unseen order; nor did they often think it possible to adjust themselves to any that might exist. Yet all were concerned with the implications of the disappearance, as it were, of that unseen order, and with the difficulties of living in the visible world without recourse to the unseen. Whereas the realist novel tends to operate primarily on the level of things that can be seen and catalogued, the modernist novel seems obsessed with vast impersonal and ineffable forces, with the way that individual lives are shaped by things unseen&#x02014;patterns, myths, social and psychic forces&#x02014;things that cannot be catalogued even by the most encyclopedic of literary forms. These are the gods of modern life with which the modern novel has to grapple.
</p>

<p>
Larkin's account of apparently secular postwar Britain suggests how the problem of sacred power remains central to religious experience after organized religion has begun to fade away. As Larkin writes, "power of some sort or other will go on." In particular, people seem to demand ultimate explanations for the forces&#x02014;psychic, social, 

<b></b>

natural, or supernatural&#x02014;that shape their lives, whether they find these explanations in traditional, liberal, or modernized religion, neo-orthodoxy or spiritualism, fundamentalism or New Age myth, or such systems of thought as pragmatism, psychoanalysis, dialectical materialism, or quantum mechanics. Although the latter four systems are arguably "secular" in that they resist appeals to the supernatural, people's relationships to these belief systems are often structured by feeling, desire, and need rather than strictly by rationality. Furthermore, the very appeal of such systems, like that of the great religions, is the rational, intellectual coherence they offer for understanding what are ultimately matters of faith. For the modernists, the privatization of religious values described by Charles Taylor and Max Weber seems already to have taken place, but its consequences are far from clear. Many modernists seek to locate ultimate meaning simply in the flux of individual experience ("an ordinary mind on an ordinary day," in Virginia Woolf's phrase).<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  At the same time, however, the modernists continually return to the problem of ritual and to the question of what types of ritual are appropriate to the privatized and pluralistic (but not necessarily secular) forms that the quest for ultimate meanings takes in modernity. Through its attention to private rituals and forms of meaning-making, the modern novel does what it can to contain and give "a shape and a significance" to those "compulsions" that the Church once "robed as destinies." While this process may be understood as a form of secularization, it does not exactly amount to a "disenchantment." Rather, it involves a shifting of the forces of enchantment from the public forum of churches to the private world of individual experience, which is the precinct of the modern novel.

Novels of the period that do address theological themes more directly seem to be excluded from the modernist canon precisely because of their express interest in religion; works by authors as varied as Georges Bernanos, Willa Cather, Marie Corelli, Graham Greene, Radclyffe Hall, Fran&#x000E7;ois Mauriac, and Evelyn Waugh bear an uneasy relation to the term "modernism." "High" modernist works address religious experience not thematically but through formal experiment.

The modernist novel's attempts to draw a sort of sacramental power from the very language of religious experience are most notable perhaps in the lengthy sermons that are such a prominent feature of such works as Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Faulkner's <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>, Djuna Barnes's <i>Nightwood</i>, and James Baldwin's <i>Go Tell it on the Mountain</i>. In each case, although great parodic energy goes into the mimicking of the preacher's voice, the sermons are not quite parodies. The authors of these novels seem to stand in awe of the pure power of the preacher's words, and they incorporate the sermons as a way of channeling that power into their own works.

Introduction: About the Author

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Mu Shiying was born in 1912 in the town of Cixi, Zhejiang province, but his family moved to the city of Shanghai when he was young. According to his friend Shi Zhecun, Mu wasn't a very serious university student, and his knowledge of classical Chinese wasn't much better than that of a middle-school student. However, Mu Shiying's first published story in 1930, "Zanmen de shijie" (Our world), was astonishing in its use of working-class slang.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  His first stories were praised by left-leaning critics in China at the time for their use of vernacular. But this assessment would soon be reversed and has given rise to rumors of an ideological shift that occurred in his work around the time of the death of his father in 1933.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Mu's fiction is sometimes divided between "proletarian" works, where he used mostly first-person narratives in "dialect," and wildly experimental work that used repetition, montage, and interior monologue. However, it would be a mistake to read the divergent views of Mu Shiying's fiction as indications of ideological shifts in the writer. Mu Shiying's fiction is often described as belonging to the "New Sensationist" (<i>Xin ganjuepai</i>) style of writing in China. The name "New Sensationist" was derived from the <i>Shinkankahu ha</i>, a group of Japanese avant-garde writers from the 1920s and1930s that included Yokomitsu Riichi, Kawabata Yasunari, Nakagawa Yoichi, and Kataoka Teppei. However, the evidence is against the actual existence of a group of writers who called themselves "New Sensationist" in China. Indeed, the term "New Sensationist" would seem to have been 

<b></b>

(and to a certain extent remains) an umbrella term attached to certain forms of experimental writing and writers in China in the 1930s.
</p>

<p>
Reputed to sit in dance halls with a notepad and pen, Mu attained quasi-celebrity status in Shanghai in the 1930s, marrying a hostess he met at a dance hall in 1936. By the mid-1930s, Mu turned to film criticism, publishing no fiction after 1937. In 1936, as a result of marital problems, Mu left Shanghai for Hong Kong in pursuit of his wife. In 1940, he returned to Shanghai and started working as the manager of the official paper of the collaborationist government of Wang Jingwei.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  That same year, one evening as Mu rode in a ricksha, he was shot from behind and killed by a Guomindang agent. Suspicion has surrounded the incident ever since, with claims that Mu Shiying was a Japanese collaborator or a double agent actually sent by the Nationalists to spy on the collaborationist government. At his death, Mu Shiying left a mark in China and Japan. Shortly after the shooting, the Japanese literary magazine <i>Bungakudai</i> (Literary circles) published a special issue to commemorate Mu's death and included a short article written by Yokomitsu Riichi that recalled a meeting the two had had a year before.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Mu Shiying's "Shanghai Foxtrot" was first published in <i>Xiandai</i> (<i>Les Contemporains</i>) in 1932.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Edited chiefly by the writers Shi Zhecun and Du Heng, <i>Les Contemporains</i> ran from 1932 to 1935. A magazine of considerable importance in Shanghai in the 1930s, <i>Les Contemporains</i> published works by most of the major writers of modern Chinese literature from almost every political and aesthetic bent of the period. Running only eight pages in its original form, "Shanghai Foxtrot" has garnered a considerable amount of attention in modern Chinese literature studies. Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to say that "Shanghai Foxtrot" is representative of Mu Shiying's oeuvre. Subtitled "a fragment," the story was republished in the 1933 collection <i>Gongmu</i> (Public cemetery), which is made up of mostly first-person narratives.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In his introduction to the volume, Mu claimed that "Shanghai Foxtrot" was a "technical exercise and experiment" that was to have been part of a longer novel entitled <i>Zhongguo yijiusanyi</i> (China 1931).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Unfortunately, Mu never got around to writing his novel. 
</p>

<p>
Mu Shiying's fiction is often held up as a significant example of the appearance of urban novelistic prose (<i>dushi xiaoshuo</i>) in modern China. One aspect of "Shanghai Foxtrot" that has fascinated critics is the depiction of the historical, semicolonial metropolis of Shanghai. The Johnny Walker billboard advertisement, the cigarette-smoking American beside a "real-estate utopia," the omnipresent Indian policemen, the churches and racing clubs, the department stores and hotels: such everyday sights of "Old Shanghai" function as specific reminders of the city's status as a treaty port, as a space deterritorialized by foreign extraterritoriality. Mu Shiying's "Shanghai Foxtrot" is truly a modernist gem of description and form, a cinematic arc light illuminating the exoticized fragments of 1930s Shanghai.

Shanghai. A heaven built on hell!<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
West Shanghai, bright moon climbing the sky, illuminating the wasted sprawl. Ashen 

<b></b>

sprawl, blanketed with silver-gray moonlight, then inlaid with deep gray tree shadows and heaps of village shadows. On top of the sprawl, iron rails draw an arc that reaches along the sky and goes down there beneath the horizon. 
</p>

<p>
Lincoln Street. (Here morality gets trampled underfoot, crime gets praised to the skies.)
</p>

<p>
Carrying a grocery basket, he walks alone there, a hand in his pocket, watches the steam of his breath slowly roil into the blue of the night's sky.
</p>

<p>
Shadows flash of three men dressed in black silk jackets and wrapped in long black robes.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Three faces beneath fedoras that only show noses and chins block his way.
</p>

<p>
"Take it easy, friend!"
</p>

<p>
"Say what you got to say. Friend."
</p>

<p>
"Every crime has its criminal, every debt its debtor. It's not like we got anything against you, everybody's got a master, we got to eat too, don't say later we weren't good friends. Remember, this day next year will be the anniversary of your death!"<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"You're joking! Come on guys, we're friends&#x02014;" Tossing his basket, his hand grabs the speaker's gun, his fist lashes out.
</p>

<p>
Bang! His hand goes limp, he falls, clutching his stomach. Bang! Another shot.
</p>

<p>
"This guy's got spunk!"
</p>

<p>
"See you in the next life, friend!"
</p>

<p>
The "black silk jackets" push back the fedoras to the napes of their necks, walk over train tracks and disappear.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" Crawls a few steps.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" Crawls another few steps.
</p>

<p>
The roar of a whistle sounds, from beneath water level a trail of arc-light beam reaches up. Rumble of iron rails, railroad ties centipede-like creep forward in the beam, telephone poles appear and disappear in the pitch black, the belly of the "Shanghai Express" shoots out, da da da, to the beat of a foxtrot,<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  bearing the night's pearl, dragon-like whipping by, rounding that arc. Lips open again with another whistle blast, a trail of smoke trails down the tail there, the arc-light beam penetrates the horizon, then disappears.
</p>

<p>
Silence again.
</p>

<p>
At the railroad crossing, the criss-crossing arc-light beams of cars, the signaler holds downturned red and green banners, pulls up that white-faced red-lipped, red-gem-earring-wearing railroad barrier. Immediately at the crossing's signal the cars fly by, a long line. 
</p>

<p>
Onto a street lined with legs of white-painted trees, legs of telephone poles, all still-life legs . . .REVUE-like,<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  heavily powdered thighs of young women intersecting and extending . . . white-painted legs in formation. Along that quiet still boulevard, from within the windows of houses, like the eyeballs of the city, piercing curtains, stealing out muted red, purple, green, light everywhere.
</p>

<p>
A car pulls up in front of a villa-style small foreign house, the car horn beeps. The bead on Mr. Virtuous Liu's skullcap shoots out.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The tinkling of the links of a gold watch hanging from the two small pockets on his black hemp vest accompanies him 

<b></b>

out of the car and into the house. He tosses half his cigar outside the entrance, walks into the living room, and, just as he sits down, from the carpet on the stairs the dada sound of the light steps of shoe heels.
</p>

<p>
"You're back?" a laughing voice asks, as his spouse, by age his daughter-in-law, by law his wife, runs in and tweaks his nose. "Hurry up! Write me a check for three thousand dollars."
</p>

<p>
"Last week's money already spent?"
</p>

<p>
Without speaking she hands him a handful of bills, yanks the sleeve of his blue satin jacket, leads him into the study, and puts a pen into his hand.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"Hey . . ."
</p>

<p>
"What?" She pouts.
</p>

<p>
He gives her a look and signs the check. She simply bows her head and gives him a kiss on the lips. "You'll have to eat supper alone tonight, me and Little Virtue are going out!" She smiles and runs out, slamming the door. He takes out a handkerchief with the word TANGEE printed on it and wipes his lips. It's as if I had a daughter, all she ever wants from me is money.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"Dad!"
</p>

<p>
He looks up, Little Virtue for who knows how long had been there beside him, staring at him like a rat who'd just seen a cat.
</p>

<p>
"You back again?"
</p>

<p>
"Stepmother called me and told me to come back."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"Money."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Virtuous Liu thought this was pretty amusing, they really had him over a barrel.
</p>

<p>
"Why would she ask you to ask me for money? Why doesn't she ask me herself?"
</p>

<p>
"I want the money. Stepmother asked me to take her out tonight."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door opens, "Don't you have any cash?" His wife Liu Yan Rongzhu runs in again.
</p>

<p>
"I've only got . . ."
</p>

<p>
A just-nail-polished little hand reaches into his pocket and takes out a leather wallet! Ruddy nails count out the bills: five, ten, twenty . . . three hundred. "You get fifty. If I give you more you'll stay out all night again." She gives him a cute look, takes her legal son's arm and out they go.
</p>

<p>
The son, a clotheshorse day in and day out reading magazines for the GIGOLO, slips on a creased, shiny, freshly pressed robe, necktie whorled in the middle, takes his mother by the arm and gets into the car.
</p>

<p>
Onto a street lined with legs of white-painted trees, legs of telephone poles, all still-life legs . . .REVUE-like, heavily powdered thighs of young women intersecting and extending . . . white-painted legs in formation. Along that quiet still boulevard, from within the windows of houses, like the eyeballs of the city, piercing curtains, stealing out muted red, purple, green, virginal lights.
</p>

<p>
They're driving a brand-new 1932 Buick, but at heart they're having a 1980 love affair. A late autumn night wind blows, blows the son's collar, the mother's hair, everything feels a little chilly. The legal mother nuzzles into her son's chest and says: 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
"What a shame you're my son." Teehee giggling. 
</p>

<p>
The son plants a kiss on his mother's tiny just-kissed-by-his-father lips and almost swerves onto the sidewalk. 
</p>

<p>
NEON LIGHT reaches colored fingers writing large words in the blue ink of night's void. An English gentleman stands there, wearing coattails, carrying a cane under his arm, walking with a lively stride. Written underneath his feet: "JOHNNY WALKER STILL GOING STRONG." At the roadside the real-estate utopia of a small grass lot, above it a Chesterfield-smoking American looks on as if to say "What a shame this lilliputian utopia; is that big lot too small for me to put my foot down in?"
</p>

<p>
A re appears in front of the car, the horn honks, the pedestrian turns back to look and slips out from the front of the car and onto the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
"Rongzhu, where do you want to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Any CABARET will do. Let's try someplace new. Licha, Dahua, I'm already bored with them."
</p>

<p>
On top of the Shanghai Racing Club track, the weather vane's golden horse kicks out four hooves toward the red moon. The grass racing track surrounded by an overflowing sea of light, waves of sin, Moore Memorial Church penetrates the darkness, kneels, prays for these men and women descended to hell. Radiating circles of light, the Great World spire, refusing all repentance, glances down condescendingly at the pedantic missionary.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Azure dusk envelopes the space completely, a SAXOPHONE reaches its neck, opens up a pair of lips, whoowhoo pounds them shouting. In the middle of that polished floor, whirling skirts, whirling cheongsam slits, exquisite shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels. Fluffed hair and male faces. Male white shirt collars and female smiles. Arms reach out, jadeite earrings swing down to shoulders. The round tables in ordered ranks, but the chairs in disarray. Waiters in white stand in darkened corners. The smell of alcohol, smell of perfume, smell of English ham and eggs, smell of cigarettes . . . singles sit in corners taking hits of black coffee to shock their nerves.
</p>

<p>
Dancing: a waltz melody spins their legs, their feet stand atop a waltz melody floating, floating.
</p>

<p>
The son leans into his mother's ear: "Some things can only be said when dancing a waltz, you're such a great waltz partner&#x02014;but, Rongzhu, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
Feeling a gentle kiss on the temple, the mother shyly cuddles into her son's chest, laughing low.
</p>

<p>
A fake French gentleman Belgian jewel broker leans into movie star Yin Furong's ear: "The smile on your lips would make all the women in the world jealous&#x02014;but, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
Feeling a gentle kiss on the temple, she shyly cuddles into his chest, laughing low, suddenly notices a new diamond ring on her finger.
</p>

<p>
The jewel broker sees Liu Yan Rongzhu and nods to her over Yin Furong's shoulder, gives her a smile. Little Virtue turns back and notices Yin Furong and GIGOLO-like raises an eyebrow in her direction.
</p>

<p>
Dancing: a waltz melody spins their legs, their feet stand atop a waltz melody floating, floating.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The jewel broker leans into Liu Yan Rongzhu's ear, softly speaks: "The smile on your lips would make all the women in the world jealous&#x02014;but, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
Feeling a gentle kiss on the temple, she shyly cuddles into his chest, laughing low, imprints a lipstick kiss on his white shirt.
</p>

<p>
Little Virtue leans into Yin Furong's ear, softly speaks: "Some things can only be said when dancing a waltz, you're such a great waltz partner&#x02014;but, Furong, I love you!"

</p>

<p>
Singles sit in corners taking hits of black coffee to shock their nerves. The smell of alcohol, smell of perfume, smell of English ham and eggs, smell of cigarettes . . . Waiters in white stand in darkened corners. The chairs in disarray but the round tables in ordered ranks. Jadeite earrings swing down to shoulders, arms reach out. Female smiles and male white shirt collars. Male faces and fluffed hair. Exquisite shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels, shoe heels. Whirling cheongsam slits, whirling skirts, in the center a polished floor. Whoowhoo pounds them shouting, that SAXOPHONE reaches its neck, opens up a pair of lips. Azure dusk envelops the space completely. 
</p>

<p>
As the glass doors open up, this fragile fantasy world pops. Run down the staircase, two rows of rickshas are waiting beside the street, the pullers stand in groups, the entrance light illuminates a path, competing "RICKSHA?" Mini Austins, Essexes, Fords, Buick sports cars, a Buick Little Nine,<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  eight cylinders, six cylinders . . . The red-faced moon limpingly walks over the racetrack's green. On the street corner the <i>Shanghai Evening Post</i><sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  seller uses a flatbread and fried-bread seller's voice to shout: 
</p>

<p>
"EVENING POST"!
</p>

<p>
A clanging electric tram gallops through a dangerous district packed with sale banners and shop signs. Bicycles look sad squeezed alongside trams. A sailor sitting in a ricksha squinting drunken eyes, takes aim at the puller's backside, gives him a kick and laughs haha. Red traffic lights, green traffic lights, the traffic light pole and the Indian policeman stand similarly erect. The traffic light changes, pours forth a wave of people, a wave of vehicles. All those people, like so many headless flies!<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  A FASHION MODEL wearing clothes from her own shop poses as a rich wife. An elevator takes fifteen seconds each trip, takes people like merchandise tossing them up to the roof garden.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  A secretary stares through silk store windows at pure silk French CR&#x000CA;PE, thinks of the razor cicatrix pale smile of her manager's lips. Ideologues and party members carry bags of leaflets, thinking if arrested they can make a speech. Blue-eyed girls in tight skirts, dark-eyed girls in cheongsams, between their thighs the same servile charm.
</p>

<p>
Beside the street, in an empty lot, a wooden pyramid-like structure stands vertically, thick wooden legs in mud, an arc light fitted in the top, light falling, illuminating the people on the wooden platform below. They shout "Aiya!" From atop a wooden frame several hundred meters high a wooden pile driver falls straight down, bang! Three arm's-length-thick wooden posts hammered into the mud, all four corners fitted with arc lights, violently expanding light illuminating the empty lot. Within the empty lot: crisscrossing ditches, steel rods, piles of bricks. A man shouldering a large beam in the ditch casts an emaciated shadow. Putting a foot forward slips, falls down, 

<b></b>

wooden beam crushes spine. Spine snaps, lips spit a mouthful of blood . . . arc light . . . bang! The pile driver slides up the wooden frame . . . on a street of coal scraps a naked child rolling a copper . . . arc light atop a wooden frame like a moon in the night's void . . . wife picking up coal scraps . . .there are two moons . . . moon snapped up by Heaven's Dog<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> &#x02014;no more moon.
</p>

<p>
The corpse is removed. In the empty lot: crisscrossing ditches, steel rods, bricks, and a puddle of his blood. Over the blood, spread a layer of concrete, steel rods arise, a new restaurant arises! A new dance hall arises! A new hotel arises! Take his strength, take his blood, take his life crushed underneath, just like other hotels, just like the Huadong hotel Mr. Virtuous Liu is striding into.
</p>

<p>
Inside Huadong Hotel:
</p>

<p>
Second floor: Whitewashed walls, ancient copper opium fragrance, mah-jongg tiles, "The Fourth Brother Visits His Mother,"<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  "The Courtesan Curses a Whore," Old Dragon Perfume and the aroma of sex, waiters in white, prostitutes, pimps, kidnappers, conspiracies and intrigues, White Russian refugees . . . <sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Third floor: Whitewashed walls, ancient copper opium fragrance, mah-jongg tiles, "The Fourth Brother Visits His Mother," "The Courtesan Curses a Whore," Old Dragon Perfume and the aroma of sex, waiters in white, prostitutes, pimps, kidnappers, conspiracies and intrigues, White Russian refugees . . .
</p>

<p>
Fourth floor: Whitewashed walls, ancient copper opium fragrance, mah-jongg tiles, "The Fourth Brother Visits His Mother," "The Courtesan Curses a Whore," Old Dragon Perfume and the aroma of sex, waiters in white, prostitutes, pimps, kidnappers, conspiracies and intrigues, White Russian refugees . . .
</p>

<p>
Spit out on the fourth floor by the elevator, Mr. Virtuous Liu hums "The Fourth Brother Visits His Mother" as he strides into the room filled with the sound of mah-jongg tiles, lights a Garrick, writes an appointment slip,<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  and in a short time, he's sitting at the table, takes up a zhong tile,<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  with a skillful hand, as if afraid to break the tile, on the one hand: "Can't seem to get the one I need," with an experienced face, on the other hand, listens as a Baiyue Laoba called Sullivan Bread<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  because she doesn't bind her breasts says: "Sorry, Master Liu, you'll have to write another slip, wait until you're finished playing and come by."
</p>

<p>
"How about coming over to our place for a visit!" Standing at the corner, dark eyes on a lime face, hidden in the shadows of a building, calling at passersby, auctioneer-like, the old madam tail-like tagging behind.
</p>

<p>
"How about if you come over to our place for a visit!" Those shriveled lips speak, purposefully bumping a flat-faced re. The flat face smiles, looks her over, points at his own nose, reaches out a head: "Old woman, are you bumping this master?"
</p>

<p>
"So young, be polite now!" The shriveled lips also smile.
</p>

<p>
"Who would've thought this Indian little white face would attract notice," strokes her face and walks away.
</p>

<p>
Nearby a long-haired unshaven writer stares at this ridiculousness, thinks up a title: Chapter 2 The Tour&#x02014;SONATA review of the city's dark side; suddenly the sight of those shrivelled lips' eyes sweeping over his own face, immediately runs over in a fluster.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Lime face hidden in the shadows, the old madam tail-like tagging behind&#x02014;hidden in the shadows lime face, lime face, lime face . . .
</p>

<p>
(The writer thinks:)
</p>

<p>
Chapter 1 The Tour the gambling den Chapter 2 The Tour streetcorner prostitutes Chapter 3 The Tour the dancehall Chapter 4 re it out later <i>The Eastern Miscellany</i>, <i>The Novel Monthly</i>, <i>Literature and Art Monthly</i><sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> first sentence write the prostitution trade on the boulevard, Beijing street . . . no good&#x02014;
</p>

<p>
Someone pulls on his sleeve: "Mister!" With one look he knows it's an old lady putting on a sad face, raises her head towards him.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Would you read a letter for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Where's the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Please come home with me to get it, it's just over in that alley."
</p>

<p>
He follows.
</p>

<p>
China's tragedy is here perfect material for a novel 1931 is my age <i>The Eastern Novel</i>, <i>North Star</i>, every month a special issue Japanese translations Russian translations translations from every country Nobel prize-winning great and rich . . . 
</p>

<p>
They turn into a small alley, so dark nothing is visible.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your place?"
</p>

<p>
"It's right here, not far, Mister. Please read a letter for me."
</p>

<p>
Over there in the alley there's a yellow streetlight, beneath the light stands a woman with her head bowed. The old woman suddenly put on a sad face again, pulled on his sleeve and said: "Mister, this is my daughter-in-law. The letter's with her." Walking over to where the woman stood, her head still bowed, the old woman spoke: "Mister, this is my daughter-in-law. My son's a machinist, he was caught stealing and arrested, have pity on us women, we haven't eaten in four days."
</p>

<p>
(Can it be such perfect material technique wouldn't be a problem what she's saying must be ideologically correct this time no one will accuse me of humanitarianism . . .)<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"Mister, have pity on us, for a few dollars I'll have my daughter-in-law spend the night with you, you'll be saving two lives!"
</p>

<p>
The writer stunned. The woman raises her head, two slender shadows reach down emaciated cheeks, the corners of a mouth form a smile.
</p>

<p>
The corners of a mouth form a smile. The fake French gentleman Belgian jewel broker leans into Liu Yan Rongzhu's ear, softly speaks: "The smile on your lips would make all the women in the world jealous&#x02014;drink up!"
</p>

<p>
Above the long-stemmed glass, Liu Yan Rongzhu's eyes smile.
</p>

<p>
In the Buick, those COCKTAIL-steeped eyes smile above the fur collar of a coat.
</p>

<p>
In the entrance to Huamao Hotel, those COCKTAIL-steeped eyes smile from between loosely hanging hair. 
</p>

<p>
In the elevator, those eyes smile beneath purple mascara.
</p>

<p>
In a room of the seventh floor of the Huamao Hotel, those eyes smile above burning red cheeks.
</p>

<p>
The jewel broker finds those smiling eyes right beneath his nose.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Smiling eyes!
</p>

<p>
White sheets!
</p>

<p>
Heavy breathing . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Heavy breathing lies on the bed motionlessly.
</p>

<p>
Sheets: melting snow.
</p>

<p>
"Let's organize an international club!" Abruptly gets a great idea while dripping delicate sweat.
</p>

<p>
Dripping with sweat, on a quiet lonely street, a ricksha puller pulls a drunken sailor towards a bar. On the street, not even a patrolman, so quiet, like a dead city. The sailor's leather shoes on the runner's spine, his hoarse voice echoes off the walls of surrounding buildings:
</p>

<p>
The ricksha puller's face, sweat oozing; his mind, foreign gold coins spinning, flying and spinning. The sailor abruptly jumps off, stumbles behind revolving doors.
</p>

<p>
HULLO, MASTER! MASTER!
</p>

<p>
Shouting, the ricksha puller runs up to the doors. An Indian policeman waves him away with a club, laughter squeezes through the door crack, the smell of booze squeezes through the door crack, JAZZ squeezes through the door crack . . . the ricksha puller picks up the ricksha poles, a December river wind swaying before him, a cold moon, a dark alley between towering buildings. Excluded from such celebration, he doesn't even entertain the thought of suicide, just lets out a curse, "Your mother's," and walks straight on into life.
</p>

<p>
The ricksha fades out of sight until the street is empty except for moonlight. Moonlight illuminates half the street with one side still immersed in darkness. The bar squats on the dark side. The light on the bar's brow is green, beneath the green glow a fossil-like Indian policeman stands. Opens and closes the door, parrotlike speaks: 
</p>

<p>
"GOOD-BYE, SIR."
</p>

<p>
A young man walks out glass doors, a cane hanging from his arm. From beneath the glow of the light he walks into the darkness, and from within the darkness into the moonlight, sighs and walks forward with conviction, thinking of his lover sleeping in someone else's bed, walks to the riverbank and stands near the railing, a blank look on his face.
</p>

<p>
The Eastern sky, sunlight, like a golden eye through spreading crow-black clouds. 
</p>

<p>
In East Shanghai, a shrill pitch of the male voice: 
</p>

<p>
"Ai . . . ya . . . ai . . ." 
</p>

<p>
Ascends upward awhile, collides with the first rays of sunlight. A magnificent choir joins in. Fast-asleep buildings stand up, raise their heads, strip off ashen nightclothes, the river gurgles eastwards, factory whistles blow. 
</p>

<p>
Song of new life, the destiny of nightclubbers! 
</p>

<p>
Wake up, Shanghai! 
</p>

<p>
Shanghai, a heaven built on hell.

<p class="noIndent">
"In Praise of the Present," a 1908 article by Adolf Loos (1870-1933), opens with the following statement, apparently unremarkable for a modernist: "When I look back over past centuries and ask myself in which age I would prefer to have lived, my answer is, in the present age."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  This remark is characteristic for Loos's well-known polemic against his contemporaries' infatuation with past ages, which led them to believe they could add luster to their homes by clothing them in pompous period styles. Yet Loos's ensuing endorsement of the present seems to jar with the scathing critique of contemporary Viennese culture with which he is customarily associated. His "praise of the present" is so emphatic that it might be taken to signify the opposite of what it states. It could be modeled after one of the countless sarcastic remarks with which Karl Kraus, one of Loos's closest friends and supporters, expressed his revulsion for contemporary Viennese and Austrian culture. As the text unfolds, however, it becomes clear that the remark is not meant ironically. "Give me my own clothes any day," Loos insists after recoiling in horror at the equivalent of adopting period styles in fashion, namely, the possibility of draping one's body in the venerable togas of ancient Rome or the opulent garb of the Italian Renaissance (<i>OC,</i> 157). The sardonic meditation on contemporary style and fashion introduced by these remarks shows just how distant Loos's vision of modernity is from Kraus's. It underlines the earnestness of his embrace of the present, which, in the context of this essay of 1908, translates into a passionate endorsement of contemporary fashion.
</p>

<p>
Walter Benjamin was among the first critics to draw a connection between Kraus's uncompromising rejection of Austria 

<b></b>

as a macrosignifier for corrupt modernity, on the one hand, and Loos's indefatigable crusade against the inauthenticity of Viennese ornamental culture, on the other.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  This link has become part and parcel of the prevalent understanding of Loos as a representative of the ascetic undercurrent of the Austrian fin de si&#x000E8;cle, which engaged in the heroic project of debunking the inauthenticity of modern life and the suffering it inflicts on the individual.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Loos's individual, it has been argued, literally wears his alienation on his sleeve. In Loos's own words, modern clothing consists of an anonymous "uniform" that does not display an individual's identity, but instead serves as a "mask," a body armor or shield of sorts, which protects individuality from an overwhelming outside.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  At closer inspection, however, the tropes of the mask and the uniform weave a narrative that deviates substantially from the conventional discourse of estranged and threatened identity, which has come to epitomize the crisis of Viennese modernity. This insight necessitates a radical reexamination of Loos's understanding of individual and collective identity, based on the discourse on beauty, style, and fashion that emerges in his writings on culture from the late 1890s to the mid-1920s. As I will argue, Loos's critique of contemporary architectural and fashion styles was not driven by a rejection of corrupt, inauthentic modernity. Rather, it represented his way of asking what kind of place the contemporary world is and how one can make it hospitable for the modern individual. The answer he provided, I contend, lay in designing homes and championing a contemporary style of dress that would suit individuals whose identity lacks the depth of a metaphysical substance and is instead inscribed on a discursive surface, which itself remains in constant flux.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I will begin by outlining Loos's polemics against ornamentation, which form a red thread connecting his reflections on architecture, design, and fashion. Loos carried out his campaign for a contemporary, i.e., nonornamental style in architecture and fashion in occasional writings, primarily newspaper articles and lectures, with arguments that often bear resemblance to those deployed by Karl Kraus. Yet the longtime friends grounded their critique in very different evaluations of the modern world. For Kraus, Austria's flirtation with the ornament and the clich&#x000E9;d phrase epitomized modernity's decadence.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  By contrast, Loos associated his contemporaries' predilection for ornamental deception with a backwardness that prevented Austria from being truly modern&#x02014;a shortcoming he sought to remedy through an agenda of "introducing Western culture to Austria."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  That is, Loos critiqued Austria for not yet having entered modernity, which for him coincided with a positive, if idealized, understanding of Western culture. His vision of Western civilization opposed the pragmatic Anglo-American world, epitomized by England and America, to an Austria, often associated with Germany, that wasted precious resources in satisfying its anachronistic infatuation with the presumed grandeur of past ages. Both poles of the spectrum are typified in Loos's pointed, abbreviated arguments. While his discussion of England and America drew in part on personal experience,<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  the two countries also functioned as a discursive trope that allowed Loos to articulate a desirable model of Western civilization, which did not necessarily correspond to the empirical reality of contemporary Great Britain or the United States, nor was it meant to. It served rather as the 

<b></b>

model of a desirable modernity that provided a framework for Loos's conceptualization of everyday culture and the individuals this culture should serve.
</p>

<p>
In Loos's thought, ornamentation generally stands for the tendency to burden everyday objects and environments with decorative elements that do not add anything to the objects' practical or symbolic function. Loos argues from within an evolutionary notion of culture that proceeds from the complex to the simple, from more to less. Modern culture&#x02014;the culture of the West that Loos would like to see introduced into Austria&#x02014;is defined by streamlining, simplification, and functionality. The passage below, taken from his famous lecture "Ornament and Crime," exemplifies Loos's evolutionary understanding of civilization through an&#x02014;at first bewildering&#x02014;juxtaposition of ornamentation and tattooing:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A child is amoral. A Papuan too, for us. The Papuan slaughters his enemies and devours them. He is not a criminal. But if a modern person slaughters someone and devours him, he is a criminal or a degenerate. The Papuan covers his skin with tattoos, his boat, his oars, in short everything he can lay his hands on. He is no criminal. The modern person who tattoos himself is either a criminal or a degenerate. There are prisons in which eighty percent of the inmates have tattoos. People with tattoos not in prison are either latent criminals or degenerate aristocrats.

<p class="noIndent">
Loos spins a tale of cultural development that predictably situates the primitive Papuan at the bottom of an evolutionary ladder that the moderns have long since climbed. At stake is an organic process that finds its double in the development of each individual from childhood to adulthood. Tattoos appear here as the symbolic expression of a relation to divinity typical for primitive peoples. As such, they are as integral a part of the religious culture of the Papuan as is ritual cannibalism. It would not make sense to brand the tattooed, cannibalistic Papuan as criminal or deviant, because this would entail judging him based on criteria that are extrinsic to his culture. However, modern civilization has outgrown the phase that expressed its religious relation to the world through tattooing and cannibalism. Practicing tattooing in the contemporary culture of the West entails appropriating a means of symbolic expression the moderns have left behind; it means engaging a relation of noncontemporaneity with the present. What constitutes an appropriate means of self-expression for the Papuan becomes a mark of criminal or degenerate tendencies in the West. This is why, Loos suggests, tattooing is for a modern individual comparable to engaging in cannibalism.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The changing fate of tattooing in the evolution of culture shows just how context-sensitive the notion of ornamentation is. It is impossible to define the ornament once and for all, because it can only be described in relation to the distinctive entwinement of cultural and economic factors that demarcate symbolic and practical functions at a certain cultural stage. Hence ornamentation represents a contextual designation more than a stable referent.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In his essay on functionalism, Theodor Adorno underscored the historical dynamics that undergird Loos's idea of ornamentation, noting that the ornament is a relic from past relations of production that has lost its functional or symbolic raison d'&#x000EA;tre. What is functional at one point can, and probably will, become 

<b></b>

ornamental at some later point.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Adorno also called attention to the metaphors of deviancy and pathology that litter Loos's lecture and that are otherwise so uncharacteristic of his rhetorical strategies. Yet Loos's language in this context does not belie the obsessive puritanism of the bourgeois who raves against the illicit, noninstrumentalizable pleasure promised by the ornament, as Adorno surmises. Rather, Loos coopts here a familiar trope of cultural pessimism to describe the pernicious effects of ornamentation, while at the same time deploying it to undermine the standard narratives of cultural pessimism. While these narratives portray the present as fallen, degenerate, and worthy only of contempt and rejection, Loos's discourse identifies degeneracy in the inability to embrace the present.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  It is not present culture that is degenerate and criminal, Loos suggests, but rather those who resist it by engaging in behavior that is at odds with it, such as ornamentation. The heavy-handed comparison between tattooing/ornamentation and cannibalism also aims at portraying the harmful effects of ornamentation in the strongest possible terms. Tattoos are as serious a problem as cannibalism because the ornamental tendency they reveal is as alien and harmful to present culture as slaughtering and devouring one's enemies.
</p>

<p>
While the discourse of degeneracy and aberration is atypical for Loos, the ferocity of his attack on the ornament in this lecture certainly is not. The question arises regarding what makes ornamentation so harmful as to warrant Loos's going out on a limb in his comparison to cannibalism. One can begin to unravel this question by observing that ornamentation for Loos exposes a problematic inability to distinguish between art proper and the aesthetic needs of everyday life. In modernity the aesthetic sphere has undergone a process of specialization, Loos believes. On the one hand, there is the domain of high art, which Loos regards, quite conventionally, as the domain of solitary genius and divine inspiration.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  As he argues in his important essay, "Architecture," from 1909, the art of genius does not seek to address any concrete need. That is, it is purposeless. Because it endeavors to shake its recipients loose from their complacency with the status quo, art finds itself at odds with the present: "A work of art is concerned with the future and directs us along new paths." By contrast, "a building is concerned with the present."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Unlike art, which envisions new, revolutionary horizons for the future, the house and the objects of everyday life exist fully in the present, for they address immediate needs. While they also raise a claim to beauty, their beauty is not informed by the traditional dictum of purposelessness, but rather represents an attempt at blending function and form. As Loos explains in an article on chairs, which he wrote on the occasion of the 1898 Christmas exhibition of arts and crafts in Vienna: "What do we understand by beauty? Complete perfection. It is, therefore, out of the question that something not satisfactorily performing its intended function can be beautiful. The first basic condition any object must fulfill, if it is to be considered 'beautiful,' is that it does not contravene the rules of practicality" (<i>OC,</i> 63).Loos's definition of beauty as the perfection of forms for everyday objects recalls only superficially the timeless ideal codified by Johann Joachim Winckelmann and German neoclassicism. The appeal to practicality makes the equation of perfection as blending function and form into a necessarily unstable and dynamic concept. In fact, function 

<b></b>

changes over time to adapt to the needs of an increasingly complex modern world, and form must follow suit. The form of chairs, for instance, has changed across ages to reflect specific needs and cultural habits. But the function of chairs has also become differentiated in the present, since "resting" does not simply mean one thing: "Following the principle that every type of tiredness requires a different chair, an English room is never furnished with one type of seat alone" (<i>OC,</i> 65). As Loos points out, at present chairs serve a variety of activities and needs that the general concept of sitting only indiscriminately captures. 
</p>

<p>
To Loos's chagrin, the purportedly most progressive currents of design and architecture of the time, those which claimed for themselves the label of "applied arts," showed little concern with the practical needs of modern life. Their program of applying art to everyday objects inauspiciously conflated high art and the aesthetic needs of everyday life in a dubious quest for attuning aesthetic pleasure to the edification of a growing mass of consumers. A case in point was the <i>Jugendstil</i> of the <i>Wiener Werkst&#x000E4;tte</i> (Vienna workshops), whose agenda, inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, aimed at bringing art to the masses by adding beautiful details to everyday objects, in order to turn them into works of art that would grace everyday life. It is not just that this program fails because it produces preciously manufactured objects whose exorbitant costs price out the great majority of consumers. Worse yet, the objects it produces are utterly nonfunctional. Loos's mischievous description of an umbrella stand he saw at the 1898 arts and crafts exhibition in Munich makes his point very eloquently. If the present requires of an umbrella stand that it hold umbrellas in the best way, the stand proudly exhibited in Munich is formed, in a most literal way, by a quite different preoccupation. Its elaborate decoration&#x02014;"aquatic plants twist upward, each with a frog sitting on it" (<i>OC,</i> 136)&#x02014;reflects the quest to express symbolically the object's connection with rain. This symbolic mode of inscribing on an object's surface its relation to reality might well be appropriate for the Papuan, but it is out of sync with the present. It produces objects fraught with symbols and recollections that belong to a past age. In addition, the surplus of meaning with which this decorative practice burdens objects is bought at the expense of function. As Loos notes, it does not matter that the sharp leaves that embellish the stand are likely to tear umbrellas apart, as long as the decorative pattern renders the object "beautiful" (<i>OC,</i> 136). According to Loos, the intent to "apply" art to everyday objects ennobles neither the object nor everyday life. Instead, it compels people to surround themselves with junk that is as pretentious as it is useless: schnapps glasses that are so oddly shaped that only contortionists can manage to bend their heads back far enough to empty out their content, or plates whose overdone decoration would make even the most delicious dish look nauseating (<i>OC,</i> 148, 153).<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Loos vigorously rebuked the charge that he was after an aesthetic asceticism predicated on "some kind of mortification of the flesh" (<i>OC,</i> 169). He had nothing against the idea of pleasing the senses that is customarily associated with the use of decorative elements. Rather, his target was the tendency to decouple the functional from the pleasing by adding decoration that had no other purpose than to be attractive, as in the 

<b></b>

new buildings of the Ringstrasse, which hid their purportedly ugly functional structures behind aesthetically pleasing historicist facades. In contemporary culture, which is characterized by a tendency to simplicity and practicality, the function of pleasing the senses ascribed to ornamentation should be carried by timely elements. For Loos it was a matter of learning to appreciate the beauty of the materials themselves, whether precious or modest, and of the forms that shaped the new objects of modern life&#x02014;telephones, streetcars, trains. At the same time, what was at stake was not inventing new forms for the sake of novelty. Loos's idea of perfection entailed that forms should not be altered at whim, but only to make an object more suited for contemporary needs: "Changes in form are not mere changes for change's sake, but come from the desire to perfect the best. We should not be trying to create a new chair for our age, but the best chair" (<i>OC,</i> 135). As Kurt Lustenberger has noted, Loos never valorized novelty for its own sake. For him new forms were only welcome if they helped improve function. The emphasis should be on function, not on the forms deployed to serve it. Loos also mocked as self-deluded contemporary endeavors aimed at creating a new language of forms: "Forms and ornament are products of the subconscious collaboration of all members of a particular culture" (<i>OC,</i> 185-6). The language of forms of a given culture is the result of an evolutionary, collective process. No single individual, school, or association could claim to create forms <i>ex nihilo</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The conflation of art and craft was also problematic for Loos because it betrayed another harmful tendency of the present, namely, the ambition to spell out "the style" of the age, that is, the cultural signature of the times. This goal, which was shared by organizations as diverse as the <i>Wiener Werkst&#x000E4;tte</i> and Vienna's association of hatmakers, was most explicitly articulated in the program of the <i>Deutscher Werkbund</i> (German association for crafts and industry), a favorite target of Loos's polemics.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Loos well understood that the <i>Werkbund</i> reflected the growing synergy of industry, design, and craft in the age of commodity capitalism and mass production. Under the pretext of articulating the style of the age, an interest lobby had formed to steer consumer taste toward its products so as to win out in the competition for growing domestic and international markets, often with the aid of generous state subsidies. Loos did not find the <i>Werkbund</i>'s alliance of capital and creative forces objectionable per se. Rather, the problem lay for him in the regressive nostalgia entailed in the goal of defining "the style" of the present. This goal relied on an idealistic notion of style as the sensuous language of forms through which an epoch finds its specific mode of self-expression. At the end of the nineteenth century the quest for style belied a distinctive cultural anxiety. The neat inventory of past styles, which the historicist mindset of the second half of the century made possible, bred awareness that the present lacked a style, a distinctive cultural language. The availability and confusion of styles became synonymous with the disintegration of culture. The quest for a new, unitary style, which informs the reflection of cultural historians like Alo&#x000EF;s Riegl and Wilhelm Worringer as well as the experiments of expressionism and the early Bauhaus, was an attempt at countering this development: that is, at creating, through style, a unitary culture that could bestow harmony and coherence on a disjointed modern world.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Loos did not at all agree with the claim that the present lacked, or urgently needed, a style. The objects built in a truly contemporary style, he argued in a critique of the <i>Werkbund,</i> "are so much in the style of our age that&#x02014;and this is the only criterion&#x02014;we do not see them as being in a 'style.' They are at one with our thoughts and feelings" (<i>OC,</i> 154-5). The contemporary style, in other words, is that which cannot be identified as a style. It corresponds so closely to the way we live that it does not make a statement. It does not leap to the eye as a unitary, coherent language, because it is always in flux, always changing to accommodate evolving needs. For Loos cultural achievement&#x02014;that is, the maturity, unity, and coherence of a culture&#x02014;was to be measured in the ability of its forms to adapt to changing needs and to evolving emotional and conceptual structures. This helps explain his demand that the exterior style of buildings be inconspicuous: "The building [has] to look unobtrusive" (<i>OA,</i> 81).<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> <i>Unobtrusive</i> denotes in this context that which does not unnecessarily call attention to itself, a language of forms that does not make a superfluous statement like the decoration on the umbrella stand, but rather fits in discreetly with its environment. This means entering into a dialogue with the surrounding space and its historical buildings, not by obsequiously imitating their styles, but by intelligently reimagining forms of the past so as to adapt them to contemporary functions and the tendency of the age toward simplification.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Loos understood that the quest for style formed a lowest common denominator between the otherwise feuding forces of tradition and innovation in contemporary architecture and design. These were, on the one hand, academic historicism, which was responsible for the period styles that graced representative buildings of the Ringstrasse; on the other, the ostensibly forward-looking camp comprising the various <i>Werkst&#x000E4;tten</i> and the <i>Werkbund</i>. Loos sardonically compared his own notion of style to the present quest for style in interior design, which resulted in the endeavor to provide a room or a space with some purportedly coherent character through the use of ornamental elements. Asked to define style, an acquaintance of Loos's candidly explained that she envisioned matching lions' heads placed "on the night stand . . . on the sofa, on the wardrobe, on the beds, on the chairs, on the washstand, in a word, on every object in the room" (<i>OC,</i> 57). In the applied arts movement it is the architect, flanked by the designer, who claims for himself the ability to deliver this longed-for harmony of forms. Loos never tired of lambasting this self-proclaimed harbinger and primary beneficiary of the contemporary longing for style, who from his drawing board pretended to offer designs that let the elements of a room blend into some magic unity. Just how spurious that unity is becomes clear once the craft worker protests his inability to execute an object according to the design imposed on him. A case in point is the deceptively na&#x000EF;ve question a stonemason asks a designer in a witty anecdote from an 1898 article: How could the animal re the stonemason was supposed to carve in stone "support itself against the pinnacle if the legs were not made longer?" (<i>OC,</i> 127) The problem is that the designer has drafted the animal as part of a neat two-dimensional drawing. But his drawing fails to take into consideration the requirements that inhere in distinctive forms and materials. Hence the animal's short legs might fit well into the designer's harmonic composition, but they cannot possibly support 

<b></b>

the stone re in real life, something that the stonemason immediately recognizes. For Loos, this neglect of the needs of day-to-day experience utterly disqualifies the trendy work of designers and architects. The problem is that they are no longer willing to recognize that each craft develops its own specific, time-bound idiom based on the distinctive qualities of the materials, the development of technology and working techniques, and the specific function an object must serve at a given time.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Massimo Cacciari has drawn attention to the distinctive vision of modernity that underlies Loos's respect for the idioms of the various crafts and the needs imposed by different life spheres. As Cacciari argues, the quest for a unitary style harbors a regressive nostalgia, one that seeks to impose on the disparate crafts and spheres of experience some unitary language and logic&#x02014;namely, that of the architect/designer. Loos exhorts his contemporaries to combat this nostalgia, according to Cacciari, by foregrounding its hostility to the decentered physiognomy of modernity. Ignoring or denying the differentiated structure of modern societies does not make the differentiation of spheres and the fragmentation of idioms go away, but rather produces designs and projects that are either nonrealizable or ill-suited to the needs of the present. By contrast, Loos's craft workers can meet the needs of the present because they regard every project as an utterly singular challenge that attempts to accommodate contingent considerations and needs. There are no one-size-fits-all answers, no stable syntheses or lasting styles, only the goal of combining function with an aesthetic pleasure that is in sync with the "thoughts and feelings" of the present, that is, one that intelligently allows individuals to relish the contingent beauty of contemporary life. This is why the work of the craftsman does not attempt to smother the specialized languages that make up modernity, but rather enables them to coalesce in the singular object in an utterly temporary, highly unstable synthesis.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this context one cannot overemphasize the extent to which Loos's embrace of differentiated modernity does not rely on philosophical arguments or on some other kind of theoretical reflection, but rather is consistently dictated by experience. That is, Loos's discourse unfailingly revolves around demonstrating that the contemporary quest for unity and style makes the modern world inhospitable in an utterly concrete sense. As Loos observes in his commentary on the stylistic lion's-head theme envisioned by his acquaintance, the objects embellished by matching lions' heads do not tolerate in their vicinity anything that lacks a lion's head. That is, it is hard to add or detract "any thing" from rooms decorated in this fashion, as the poor rich man of a humorous parable must find out when he smuggles a birthday gift into the expensively decorated home an architect has designed for him.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The problem is that the synthesis this style is meant to embody is unnaturally static. It stifles life because it disregards its accidental and time-bound quality&#x02014;for instance, it makes no concessions for the disparate objects one accumulates over time. Hence it engenders a noncontemporary way of living, where <i>noncontemporary</i> means <i>uncomfortable</i> in a most concrete sense:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p class="noIndent">
Friedrich Nietzsche's meditation on the excesses of historical consciousness, which burdens the present with the overbearing memory of the past and renders it a desolate place, is transposed in Loos's discourse onto an utterly material plane.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The furniture modeled after the styles of antiquity is so uncomfortable that using it amounts to a sadistic ritual; the handles inspired by period styles are so unfunctional that one gets calluses from using them. In other words, the problem with the quest for style, whether it revives the glorious styles of the past or imagines the visionary style of the future, lies in its sacrificing function in a way that renders homes unfriendly and everyday life cumbersome.
</p>

<p>
The function of everyday culture, as carried by the objects that surround us, is to help people live in the present in the best possible way, Loos admonishes his contemporaries. Everyday objects should help create the best fit between the individual and the world; that is, they should help make individuals feel at home in the contemporary world in the most concrete of senses. Hence the contemporary style is that which fosters contemporaneity in a literal sense; it does not suggest the possibility of living in another, better world, whether past or future, but seeks to draw out the beauty and pleasures of the present one in order to make it a friendly, hospitable place. To do so, it acknowledges the modern cacophony of languages and needs and mutates to reflect their evolving interplay. This is not a dubiously affirmative endeavor, one that seduces individuals into complying with their subjugation by the dark forces of modernity, as Adorno suggested in his reading of Loos. Yet it certainly lacks the subversive power Loos attributes to art, for it seeks to improve life based on an evolutionary understanding of everyday culture that is at odds with the revolutionary function Loos assigned to art. Loos's desire to make the present a "homey place" also has little to do with the Heideggerian ontology of home or <i>oikos</i> that Massimo Cacciari ascribes to him.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To make oneself at home in the world does not entail for Loos the intuition of a radical being-in-time, which, according to Heidegger, the modern world of rationalization and technological progress has obliterated. It also does not entail hope in the opening up of a messianic moment in which humans could potentially glimpse that "center" or "origin" that would allow them to reassemble debris from the rubble pile of history, as Cacciari suggests, drawing on Benjamin's reference to Paul Klee's <i>angelus novus</i>. In other words, the ontological discourse of Heidegger and Benjamin draws one away from Loos's understanding of modernity rather than helping to clarify it, because it suggests a reading of the present as fallen and in need of redemption that jars with Loos's optimistic assessment of the contemporary world. Perhaps one could better describe Loos's position by pointing to the unconventional understanding of nihilism William Connolly develops in his reading of Nietzsche. If nihilism is customarily associated with insight into the loss of metaphysical certainties and the disintegration of a 

<b></b>

modern world consigned to contingency, the true nihilist, Connolly argues, is not the individual who endeavors to make himself at home in the world by embracing its decenteredness and transience. Rather, the nihilist is the individual who rejects the present because of its metaphysical homelessness and lack of coherence<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> &#x02014;or, as Loos would argue, who seeks to impose onto the present a stylistic unity the present can no longer tolerate.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The issue of which attitude towards modernity is suggested by Loos's articulation of everyday culture deserves closer scrutiny, however. Janet Stewart has pointed to the affinity between Loos's demand that everyday culture create a fit between the individual and the world and Georg Simmel's vision of a correspondence between subjective and objective culture, that is, between an individual's inner experience and the outer circumstances of everyday life.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Simmel's individual is endowed with a metaphysical space of introspection, whose integrity culture should both mirror and protect, and whose harmonious development it should foster. Accordingly, Simmel locates the function of culture in its ability to project the unity or totality of modern existence, which underlies the superficial reality of differentiation and specialization, as an inner unity of the individual. When this fit is missing, the result is alienation, like the alienation the individual experiences in the metropolis.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The question is whether Loos's call for a fit between "inner and outer person" signals his indebtedness to a late-idealistic notion of culture and individual identity akin to the one that underpins Simmel's discourse. This debt would place Loos in close proximity to the contemporary proponents of a unity of style and culture he so cheerfully attacked.
</p>

<p>
In this context one must begin by examining the charge of inauthenticity that drives Loos's critique of the ornament. This has often been interpreted as pointing to an insufferable discrepancy between some ideal core of individual and collective identity, on the one hand, and the outer circumstances of modern life, on the other. Upon closer inspection, it appears that Loos's discourse of authenticity is not predicated on revealing a condition of unalienated subjectivity or nature, nor is it about being able to glimpse an obfuscated truth beyond the corrupting effects of time and history. The inauthenticity fostered by the ornament rather entails for Loos a much plainer type of deception. It is about the dishonesty of wanting to look like more than one is by means of undignified trompe l'oeil effects. This inauthenticity is a vice of a very specific social stratum in contemporary Austria, namely, of a bourgeoisie that is haunted by a longing to emulate the lifestyle of the aristocracy so as to appropriate its social status. Because the bourgeois is unable to afford the pomp he associates with the upper classes, he resorts to filling his home with things that feign preciosity and thus are never what they seem, for instance, tables made of fake mahogany or brass made to look like gold. The stakes of Loos's attack on inauthenticity are made most clear in his famed lecture on Vienna as a Potemkin City. Here Loos castigates the Austrian capital for proudly constructing a monumental boulevard, the Ringstrasse, that showcases residential buildings whose historicist facades are nothing but a plaster screen designed to hide modest bourgeois dwellings behind the display of aristocratic pomp. Far from persuading the onlooker of the nobility of the dwellings' inhabitants, Loos notes, the ostentatious 

<b></b>

deception of these facades rather suggests the crass taste and social envy of the parvenu.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  "We should stop feeling ashamed of living in the same building as many other people of the same social status. We should stop feeling ashamed of the fact that there are building materials we cannot afford," Loos forcefully concludes (<i>OA,</i> 28). The bourgeoisie should take pride in its accomplishments rather than devaluing them by feigning a social status it does not possess.
</p>

<p>
Loos's discourse on inauthenticity still raises the question of how, exactly, he envisions those modern individuals whose houses he would like to build and decorate. The issue is what kind of desirable identity and self-consciousness Loos opposes to the Ringstrasse parvenu. When reading his essays one is immediately struck by the peculiar depthlessness of the individual identity that should be reflected in a living space. Quite telling in this context is the vision of a house's individual style, which Loos developed in contradistinction to his acquaintance's theme of the matching lions' heads. Loos offers as a model his parents' old house, which was a hodgepodge of disparate objects and pieces of furniture accumulated over time: the table graced by "dreadful metalwork," the desk defaced by an ink stain made by his sister Hermine when she was little, the "dreadful frames" of his parents' pictures, "the old-fashioned chair" that was "a leftover from grandmother's home." As Loos further reminisces, "every piece of furniture, every object, every thing had a story to tell, the story of our family. Our home was never finished, it developed with us, and we with it. It was certainly without "style"; that is, it had no alien, no old "style." But it did have a style, the style of its occupants, the style of our family" (<i>OC,</i> 58). Loos presents in this passage the familiar argument that a place, a room, a house should reflect the taste of its inhabitants, lest they be tyrannized by the space in which they live.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Taste in this context is not a projection of an individual's inner life, however, but rather denotes the accidental choices made by individuals over time, who acquire objects they happen to like or find useful at a specific moment: "What would then unite all the pieces of furniture in a room would be the fact that their owner had selected them" (<i>OC,</i> 59). Some of the objects assembled in the house have come to the family not by deliberate choice, but rather in a haphazard process of accumulation. While we are not told who was responsible for picking the table with the ugly metalwork, we at least know that the old-fashioned chair is a keepsake from grandma's home. In other words, the individual style of Loos's family living room is little more than the idiosyncracies of individual histories, as reflected in the objects and memories individuals have amassed over time.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The histories inscribed in these objects do not reveal anything about the inner life of the respective individuals, but rather relate to external, incidental events, like the ink stain with which little Hermine managed to add a personal touch to her parents' desk. To be sure, the objects in Loos's room help anchor memories, but these are thoroughly external and material, consigned to events and not to some introspective space.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Loos's discourse on fashion provides further important insights for understanding the kind of modern individual he had in mind for the houses he built. This discourse revolves around the idea that modern clothing should serve as a mask that enables individuals to effectively impersonate a social role. Beatriz Colomina sees the trope of 

<b></b>

the mask as key to grasping the modern schizophrenia of Loos's individuals. This is a condition defined by a lack of communication between an individual's inward space and his outer appearance. The outside of the individual, his or her clothing, becomes a protective screen rather than the expression of his/her individuality. In this regard, the polarity inside/outside becomes inscribed onto the distinction between the private and the public sphere: clothing, much like a house exterior, belongs to the public sphere. Colomina supports her understanding of the "mask" by pointing to Loos's demand that both the exterior of a house and the clothing of an individual should be "<i>unauff&#x000E4;llig</i>." This appeal to inconspicuousness, she suggests, signifies a deliberate refusal of the inside, be it the intimate space of the house interior or the subject's introspective space, to communicate with the outside; it is therefore tantamount to a self-imposed autism.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  As suggestive as it may be, Colomina's reading seems difficult to reconcile with Loos's own explanation of the term <i>inconspicuous,</i> which points to the opposite of autism, namely, to the ability to fit in, to enter into a dialogue with a specific environment or social group in a contemporary manner. In an 1898 article, "Men's Fashion," for instance, Loos identifies modern dressing with inconspicuous clothing. In raising the question of what it means to be dressed in a modern fashion, Loos argues that the answer consists in being dressed well or correctly. "The point is," as he further explains,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
to be dressed in such a manner as to attract as little attention to oneself as possible. A red tail coat would attract attention in the ballroom, therefore a red tail coat is not the modern style for the ballroom. A top hat would attract attention when ice-skating, therefore a top hat is not the modern dress for ice-skating. Among the best people, to attract attention to oneself is considered vulgar.

As this passage suggests, clothing should make one fit for society. To fit into society means to blend in. It entails appropriating the outer appearance and manners suited to a specific circumstance, be it the ballroom or the ice-skating ring. The appropriately dressed individual is <i>unauff&#x000E4;llig</i> in the sense that he or she does not unnecessarily attract attention in a given social context. The reference point for Loos's discourse on fashion is the stratified society of late-nineteenth-century Austria, in which economic and political developments gave rise to limited upward mobility. In differentiated modernity individuals are defined by the class or professional sphere to which they belong. For Loos, however, the various social strata should be placed on a level playing field, which would enable mutual communication, so that each class's contribution to the well-being of society can be acknowledged. This exchange ensures the general progress and well-being of society, fostering the values of urbanity, simplicity, and efficiency that Loos saw at the heart of Western civilization. Loos's positive model of an open society is best illustrated by an anecdote that introduces the first article of his short-lived magazine, <i>The Other</i>. Here Loos recounts his experience with two distant relatives, Uncle Ben and his wife, whom he met during a trip to the United States. Having had dinner with the couple on their farm near Philadelphia, Loos fails to recognize them when he sees them again four weeks later at a funeral in the city. As he 

<b></b>

explains, he was unable to make the connection between the modest farmer couple he had visited in the countryside and the elegantly dressed gentleman and lady who approached him at the cemetery. What impresses Loos is the ability of his American relatives to slip into the clothes and appropriate the manners of the city dweller when required by the circumstances. They may well be farmers, but culturally they are not cut off from the life of the city and are aware of the roles one might play in environments different from their own.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In Loos's idealizing view of America as the model of Western modernity, city and countryside do not constitute mutually unintelligible planets, but rather are two facets of a modern world developing toward simplicity and functionality. When measured against this yardstick, the existence of millions of Austrian peasants who live in complete cultural isolation and are utterly unable to function in any other social environment represents for Loos an indictment of Austria's backwardness with respect to the civilized Western world. 
</p>

<p>
Loos's ideal does not aim at undoing the difference between social strata, but rather at combating what he saw as the social and cultural marginalization of the lower classes in Austria, especially the peasantry. His vision, according to which people become able to bridge different social roles, at least temporarily, by displaying the appropriate clothing and manners, may well appear na&#x000EF;ve from today's perspective, especially since it lacks any concrete indication as to how one would go about helping Austrian peasants overcome their cultural isolation and become familiar with other social strata. It also betrays the unreflective elitism of the bourgeois intellectual who takes himself as the model for a desirable modernity. When it comes to class, in fact, Loos's vision of Western civilization boils down to the ideal of a refined bourgeoisie that takes pride in its accomplishments not by displaying the crass taste of the nouveau-riche but by appropriating the aristocracy's virtue of discreet distinction (<i>Vornehmheit</i>). What renders Loos's notion of clothing and fashion intriguing, however, is its underlying understanding of social meaning and identity as created on the surface. This suggests that social identity can be appropriated, manipulated, and exchanged, provided one learns to play a part, to fit a role.
</p>

<p>
Which aspects of an individual's identity should be enacted by clothing is most pointedly suggested in Loos's humorous juxtaposition of the German's attitude toward fashion and the Englishman's in his 1908 article "In Praise of the Present." Here Loos outlines his evolutionary understanding of fashion, which he sees as grounded in a handful of basic forms and materials that offer the best fit for humanity's needs. In the contemporary world clothing is supposed to fulfill two functions, namely, to provide adequate protection from the weather and the environment and to allow one to play a social role. It does not lend itself to marking the individual as an individual, Loos believes, but rather provides an outer semblance, a mask, for an individuality that is too strong to be expressed through outer appearances.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The English are credited with the achievement of having perfected modern clothing and making it exemplary: "And the form was developed into the single form, the uniform, in which the individual personality can best hide its riches. It became a disguise [<i>Maske</i>]" (<i>OC,</i> 158). In this context the disguise of the mask does not function as a protection for a person's threatened 

<b></b>

individuality, as Colomina argues, but rather inscribes the social identity of individuals whose personality is too complex to be rendered by clothing. In the present, failing to adopt the "mask" of contemporary fashion and insisting on expressing one's individuality through one's outer appearance entails making oneself unnecessarily conspicuous. This is, regrettably, a common problem among the Germans:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
They [the Germans] can still express their individuality through curious styles and unusual inventions in their wardrobe, through fantastic neckties. Inwardly, however, they are all the same. Every single one of them goes to Tristan one day and the vaudeville the next, smokes his five cigars a day, says the same things in the same situations (you only have to ask a prostitute), drinks the same number of beers to make sure he gets to sleep, tells risqu&#x000E9; jokes after twelve o'clock, and goes to bed with his wife. With all that, he insists on clothing himself in an individual style and despises the uniformity of the Englishman's dress.

<p class="noIndent">
If Germans sport neckties that strike others as recklessly outlandish, this is because their misled quest for originality in clothing leads them to pursue some purportedly individual language of forms. Yet forms have nothing to do with a quest for originality, but rather emerge from a collective endeavor to serve function in the best way. Hence the German who tries to express his individuality through individually chosen forms only ends up looking quirky<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> &#x02014;which is to say, unnecessarily conspicuous.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Loos here targets a recurrent self-image articulated in a discourse stretching from Johann Fichte to Julius Langbehn, namely, that of the Germans as a <i>Volk</i> of individuals endowed with strong personalities. Yet, as Loos notes, the presumably individualistic German actually displays a remarkable conformity in matters of inward life, which extends from his hybrid taste in theater to the jokes he is able to tell after a certain hour. As the passage suggests, it is time to debunk the myth of German individuality, which in the present is only substantiated by the Germans' quirky clothing. But even more interesting is the way in which the inward life of individuals is described. It seems to be limited to fairly superficial tastes and habits that recall the accidental choices made by Loos's family in matters of furniture. Significantly, both the deplored German and the admired English seem to share a fairly shallow inner life. For the German going to a Wagner opera is placed on the same plane as drinking beer and smoking cigars. The Englishman's individuality finds expression in an equally disparate catalog of tastes and activities, which range from a love for Shakespeare and for theater in general to indulgence in the pleasures of sexuality and drinking (<i>OC,</i> 159).
</p>

<p>
In this context it would be instructive to compare the discourse on fashion and identity articulated by Loos to the notion of clothing as harmful ornamentation that, according to Mark Anderson, represents a central trope in Franz Kafka's critique of aestheticism. Anderson argues that for Kafka the ornamental quality of clothing lies in its forming an inessential and corrupting cocoon around the inner core of subjectivity. Clothing must thus be shed in order for this inward space to be revealed in its essential purity.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  For Loos, on the other hand, clothing represents a mask designed to cover an individuality that can no longer be expressed through outer appearance. At closer inspection 

<b></b>

this individuality turns out to be little more than an incidental catalog of preferences and habits. Its complexity lies more in its disparateness and fortuitousness than in its depth and inner coherence. If for Anderson's Kafka clothing is a problematic ornament because it wraps an inauthentic shroud around the individual's core, for Loos the ornamental misuse of clothes occurs when clothing is deployed to display a person's presumed inner core. In exercising some healthy self-examination the person in question might discover, as the individualistic German should, that his or her cherished individuality is little more than a haphazard assemblage of habits and preferences. An examination of women's clothing reveals how for Loos even the most intimate aspect of an individual's identity, namely, gender, is not rooted in some essential core of subjectivity, but is instead inscribed on the discursive surface provided by an individual's outer appearance. Loos's discussion of women's fashion should be examined against the backdrop of the essentializing discourse on gender reconstructed by Silvia Bovenschen in her pathbreaking inquiry into "imagined femininity." At issue is a "gender metaphysics" that stretches back to the Enlightenment and is bent on portraying women as fundamentally sexual beings. At the turn of the twentieth century, the crisis of German culture is widely perceived as having its roots, at least in part, in a final showdown between the sexes triggered by their irreducible, essential differences, which Bovenschen outlines by drawing on arguments articulated by Karl Scheffler, Georg Simmel, Max Scheler, and Ludwig Klages.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Loos seems at first to follow this line of thought in his inquiry into the distinctive principles that govern women's clothing. In an early essay specifically dedicated to "Ladies' Fashion" , he wonders aloud why women's clothing, unlike men's, has remained so utterly impractical with its extravagant ornamentation, flaunty colors, and gowns that reach to the ankles and impede movement (<i>OC,</i> 109). If men's fashion has evolved according to principles of inconspicuous elegance, then women's fashion is just the opposite, a continuous endeavor to attract attention, namely, the attention of men. As such, it reflects the continued, eroticized role of women in contemporary society, displaying the degree to which women's subsistence remains predicated on their ability to win the love and protection of a man. 
</p>

<p>
Upon closer scrutiny, however, it becomes clear that Loos's arguments unfold a scenario very different from the essentializing discourse on gender that Bovenschen compellingly critiqued. For Loos the contemporary view of women as sexual beings, which women's clothing so conspicuously displays, has little to do with essential traits that would distinguish women from men. Rather, it is the result of a discourse on sexuality concocted within an essentially male culture over centuries. Foreshadowing some of Sigmund Freud's arguments on the necessary repression of libido in the process of civilization, Loos maintains that humans are "domesticated animals" that have subjected their sexual urge to unnatural constraints.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The exhibitionism of women's fashion, then, is born out of the necessity to bind men to women by rendering steady their erotic desire, which would otherwise exhaust itself in the episodic compulsion of the sexual drive: "You will have heard the argument that it was modesty that made woman adopt the leaf. How wrong can one be! Modesty, an emotion laboriously 

<b></b>

manufactured by refined culture, was alien to the primitive human race. Woman clothed herself, and thus made herself a mystery to man, in order to fill his heart with a longing to solve the mystery" (<i>OC</i> 107). Women's clothing only apparently serves the purpose of chastely protecting their bodies from the lustful gaze of men. In reality, its conspicuous ornamentation represents a constant provocation to men's gaze, promising, indeed, flaunting what it simultaneously conceals, as Janet Stewart has noted (<i>OC,</i> 114). Women are forced into this role by an ideological system that grants them social status exclusively through their relation to men. The status of the discourse on sex and sensuality, as well as the role of women in this discourse, is exemplified by the changes that the notion of sensuality underwent over a relatively short span of time. At the end of the 1870s, Loos notes, the ideal was the "voluptuous woman, the mature female form, and any woman who did not possess such curves had to fake them." Only a few years later the ideal of the full-bosomed woman is displaced by its opposite, namely, the "child-woman," the unripe, adolescent girl celebrated by Peter Altenberg (<i>OC,</i> 108). The capricious succession of disparate models of femininity within only a few decades suggests that there is an ultimately arbitrary relation between erotic desire and the cultural signifiers with which desire becomes coded over time. There is no necessary signifier for sensuality, Loos seems to intimate. Cultural signifiers are placeholders for something that has no essential core.
</p>

<p>
The understanding of sensuality outlined in this passage exhibits remarkable parallels to Michel Foucault's discussion of a "repressive hypothesis" in the first volume of his <i>History of Sexuality</i>.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  For Foucault, the endeavor undertaken in late-seventeenth-century Europe to discipline the sexual did not so much repress sexual practices that had become associated with sin and pathology, but rather called sexuality into being in the first place as a defining aspect of an individual's identity, of an individual's gendered identity. For Foucault, the injunction to silence that defines the repressive sexual mores of the West is in reality an injunction to discourse, namely, the creation of desire by a permanent, discursive titillation that helps fix the identity of the sexed body. In Loos's text, clothing produces desire by concealing the naked female body; desire is fueled by the "mystery" that the veil of clothes creates, not by the body itself. This "mystery" functions not only as a titillation of desire but also as an injunction to discourse. The contents of this discourse&#x02014;women as voluptuous temptresses or innocent adolescents&#x02014;stand in an ultimately arbitrary relation to their purported object&#x02014;women and their bodies. As Loos understands, the vagaries of fashion show how women's identity is created on a discursive surface. But it is incorrect even to speak of a surface, since this term implies a depth that does not exist. Drawing on Judith Butler, a masterful reader of Foucault and Nietzsche, one can claim that fashion for Loos becomes emblematic of the various ways in which different gender and social roles are performed. Loos does not postulate any essential identities beyond this performance. Or, to put it in the terms of Nietzsche's famous dictum, for any action it is not necessary to assume the prior existence of a doer. Rather the identity of the doer is constituted through the doing itself.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
At the end of the essay Loos wishes for the advent of an era in which women will be allowed to be productive members of the public sphere and wear trousers. In this 

<b></b>

context one must underscore the economic thrust of Loos's argumentation, lest one make Loos into the feminist he was not. Loos was not interested in the emancipation of women per se. Rather, he believed that the continued relegation of women to the roles of sexual enticement and domestic servants for men hampered the development of civilization. In other words, the exploitation of women was harmful for both women and men, though in different ways.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  It is significant that Loos's arguments are primarily utilitarian and pragmatic. This is true not just of this early essay, but more generally of his polemics against the ornament. If absolute ethical imperatives require some essential notion of subjectivity, then Loos's view of identity as inscribed on a fluid, discursive surface precludes recourse to such imperatives. Fedor Roth has argued that Loos's ethical vision is instead shaped by an economic eudaemonism, an Enlightenment vision in which the happiness and well-being of individuals, pursued through equitable self-realization, becomes a path to the well-being of society at large.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Loos's discourse on identity gives an utterly positive spin to one of the most troubling insights of Viennese modernism, namely, the understanding of the self as lacking an essential core. Here the quintessentially modernist discourse of authenticity as a correspondence between appearance and essence is replaced by a discourse of honesty. Honesty means shaping private and public spaces in a way that reflects the circumstances of one's life. This entails, in the private sphere, refraining from pursuing some artificial unity of style in one's home and rather allowing for spaces to reflect the accidental course of an individual's life. In the public sphere honesty requires that one not attempt to look other than one is, either by building houses whose facades promise nonexistent wealth and status or by wearing clothes that ostentatiously project individuality. Not that the individual lacks individuality for Loos. However, an individual's core is for him not the coherent nucleus of meaning that unconventional clothing supposedly conveys. Hence clothing should be concerned with a different type of message, namely, one relative to the role an individual is called on to play in a specific situation. Being able to inhabit different social positions by manipulating one's appearance harbors for Loos an opportunity for gradual emancipation, as documented by his American relatives. The flip side of deploying an individual's appearance for this inscription of social meaning lies, however, in accepting the awareness that one's individuality is not a coherent, self-identical, original substance worthy of being projected on the outside. It entails learning to cherish one's private self for what it is, an assemblage of accidental, incoherent, inessential qualities and habits.
</p>

<p>
Honesty further demands that one be able openly to acknowledge the multiplicity of languages and spheres, as well as the trend toward simplification and practicality, that make up modernity. Loos's embrace of differentiated modernity is not plainly affirmative, as his critique of the present shows. At the same time, his response to modern needs and problems aims at reforming the modern world, not at overturning it. That is, Loos's discourse deliberately articulates itself from within bourgeois modernity. It refuses to postulate a utopian outside, whether located in some nostalgic vision of the past or in a vision of apocalypse and revolution that purports to engender a wholly new future. Hence Loos had no misgivings about holding on to a residual form 

<b></b>

of individualism, albeit one that is hollowed out of the belief in essential qualities. By the same token, he showed no interest in erasing the line between the private and the public spheres. His immanent self-positioning enabled him to pass up all avant-garde dreams of a tabula rasa and radical new beginnings to ponder the question of how one can best make the present world a desirable, homey place.<sup>45</sup>  The ensuing concern with the aesthetic needs of day-to-day life prompted him to grant everyday culture its dignity and autonomy with respect to the domain of art, and vice versa. It engendered an open-minded, cordial examination of everyday life and popular culture, which seems more appealing in retrospect than the intransigent gesture of erasure that characterized much avant-garde discourse.

As Walter Benjamin points out, Kraus claimed for himself a position outside of the historical flow that makes up modernity in order to launch his attack on the modern world, which he found emblematically symbolized in the falseness of contemporary Austrian culture.

Janet Stewart points out that Loos's understanding of the development of civilization relies on an exoticizing discourse that ascribes to the Papuan the position of the primitive. This hierarchical understanding of cultural development also shapes the opposition between a civilized West and a backward East that in her eyes structures Loos's discourse. At the same time Stewart cautions that Eastern culture is not always an exclusively negative model for Loos. She nevertheless concludes that Loos's discourse construes a cultural "other" that forms a threat for Western civilization. Janet Stewart, <i>Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism</i> (New York: Routledge, 2000), 64, 69-70. In this respect one must note that in the lecture on ornament and crime the charge "retrograde" does not denote the Papuan, but rather the modern who unreflectively revives elements of Papuan culture. If there is a threat, this does not emanate from Papuan culture, but rather from the Westerner's cultural na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;. For Loos, the problem with those moderns who engage in tattooing and ornamentation is that they fail to see the cultural distance that separates them from the Papuan and mistakenly appropriate his behavior. It must also be pointed out that Loos refrains from rehashing the patronizing narrative of the "good savage," whose untainted being supposedly reminds the moderns of the innocence they have lost as a result of the corrupting process of civilization. See for instance the discourse on the primitive articulated in the work of artists of the <i>Blaue Reiter</i> and <i>Br&#x000FC;cke</i> groups.

Cultural pessimism constitutes a reaction to the troubling phenomena linked to modernization&#x02014;rationalization, industrialization, urbanization, as well as the development of consumer culture and mass politics&#x02014;within German-speaking culture between the 1860s and the 1920s. It represents an intellectual attitude bent on blaming modernity for the corruption of a nation's cultural-spiritual compass, while at the same time postulating an idealized realm of culture as a last source for national redemption. Authors who count among the classics of cultural pessimism include Paul Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. For an analysis of this phenomenon, see Fritz Stern's classic study, <i>The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of Germanic Ideology</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961).

Especially in his early writings, Loos exemplifies his notion of art by drawing on the iconic artists included in the canon of the educated bourgeoisie. These range from Botticelli to Goethe, from Beethoven to Wagner. Starting from the mid-1900s, Loos's references to this canon decrease significantly, possibly as a result of his contacts with avant-garde circles in Munich and Berlin. In general the notion of high art appears to be far less developed than that of everyday culture in Loos's writings. It represents little more than a foil for delimiting and defining the aesthetic needs of everyday life.

For Loos, this combination of function and artistic claims has harmful effects not just for everyday culture, but also for art. It erodes art's distinctive impact on the recipient&#x02014;adapting a Wagnerian melody for a doorbell does not precipitate the home owner into Parzifal's world every time the doorbell rings. Instead, over time Wagner's tune merely becomes associated with the reflex to answer the door. See Loos's humorous parable "The Story of the Poor Little Rich Man," in <i>OA</i>, 48-52.

In this context Lustenberger points out that precisely this evolutionary understanding of forms accounts for Loos's open-minded relation to the architectural forms of the past. Specifically, it provides a frame for understanding his admiration for the architecture of Greek antiquity, which he praised for its ability to deliver architectural solutions still unsurpassed in the present. Loos's evolutionary understanding of forms accounts for the difficulty of assessing his work within the development of modern architecture. On the one hand, his appeal to functionality and simplicity anticipates important tenets of the International Style. On the other, his creative classicism, admiration for past architectural styles, and desire to provide site-specific architectural solutions are hardly reconcilable with the absolute architectural language of modernists like Mies van der Rohe and Martin Gropius. This difficulty gave rise to the conventional view of Loos as a forerunner who intuited the direction in 

<b></b>

which modern architecture was moving, but could not rid himself of a residual infatuation with the past, which was finally overcome by the heroic modernism of the International Style. The historical teleology implicit in such an account was challenged at the dawn of postmodernism in the early 1960s. This questioning made possible a reevaluation of Loos's work as emblematic of a different strain of architectural modernism that coexisted with the more familiar modernism of the International Style, rather than being superseded by it.

Charles Haxthausen has outlined the central role that late-nineteenth-century debates concerning style as a unitary, collective endeavor played in the rise of art history as a modern discipline. Haxthausen points out that Nietzsche's dictum according to which the unity of artistic style represents the expression of the cultural effort of a people recapitulates a preoccupation of nineteenth-century aesthetic reflection that extends as far back as Wilhelm von Humboldt. At the turn of the twentieth century the concern with the loss of a unified style migrates from the reflection of art historians such as Worringer and Riegl into the discourse of expressionism, and through it into that of the early Bauhaus.

A good example of Loos's understanding of <i>inconspicuousness</i> is, quite paradoxically, the controversial exterior of the house on Vienna's Michaelerplatz Loos built in 1909-10. This was a commission by Goldman and Salatsch, the fashionable men's tailor and clothing store patronized by Loos. The unadorned facade of the house was perceived to be such an insult to the surrounding historical buildings, particularly the Imperial Palace, that municipal authorities stepped in. The ensuing lawsuit ended in an ordinance forcing the house owner to add ornamental flower boxes to the windows. The irony is that Loos had designed the exterior to communicate with the surrounding buildings in a way he thought appropriate for that public space, a central square connecting a section of the Imperial Palace with one of Vienna's most exclusive shopping boulevards, the Kohlmarkt. Loos insisted that he had followed the example set by the old Viennese architects in maintaining a strict distinction between commercial and residential spaces, which is articulated in the contrast between the precious marble cladding of the bottom part of the facade and the unassuming stucco of the top. See Loos's brief reply, "Eine Zuschrift," in Adolf Loos, <i>Trotzdem. Gesammelte Schriften 1900-1930,</i> ed. Adolf Opel (Vienna: Prachner, 1982), 110-1.

Cacciari, "Loos-Wien," 18-27. Implicitly disagreeing with Cacciari, Fedor Roth argues that Loos cultivated the longing for some higher harmony of culture, which is made possible if one lets each craft work toward satisfying human needs in the best possible way. This leads to the establishment of common forms and counters the unnecessary individualism in cultural production, be it in fashion or in the forms of everyday objects. See Roth, <i>Adolf Loos</i>, 204-5. While it is true that Loos believed that the contemporary trend to practicality would lead to a small inventory of functional forms, it is also true that he did not believe that such forms could be imposed from the outside on the various crafts as a series of rules, but rather that they would be achieved immanently if each craft was allowed to develop its specific logic. That is, the trend to uniformity as simplicity was predicated, paradoxically, on respecting the qualitative differences of each craft. Hence, respecting the disunity of the crafts would lead to a common inventory of forms that could not be mandated from any central instance. This formal inventory was itself an unstable, dynamic construct, reflecting the needs of a given society at a given point in time.

Loos's insistence that a house's interior should reflect the taste of its inhabitants is not meant to rule out completely the intervention of the architect or the interior designer. After all, this stance would have undermined Loos's own activity as an interior designer. The point is that the designer and the architect should not base their projects on some abstract notion of style, but rather should work closely with their clients so as to design contemporary living spaces in which the individual can feel comfortable and which he can grow into. On the relation between designer and client, see the short piece "Das Heim" (The home), from 1903, in Loos, <i>Trotzdem,</i> 41-4.

In this respect Loos draws a distinction between private and public rooms in a home. The private rooms should be allowed to reflect the taste or lack thereof of their inhabitants. By contrast, the rooms devoted to receiving guests or to other public functions occupy a middle space between the private sphere of the home and the public sphere outside. Hence they should be furnished and decorated in a manner appropriate to the public sphere. Rooms like the bathroom or the kitchen should also be designed by specialists because of their specialized functions (<i>OC</i>, 59).

In the course of the narration, however, it becomes clear that Malte's remembered childhood is not an idyllic inner space in which Malte can seek refuge from the alienating experience of Paris, but rather harbors dark experiences of estrangement that correlate with the experience of the metropolis. The metropolis becomes a screen on which Malte can project the inner alienation that has haunted him since childhood. Rainer Maria Rilke, <i>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,</i> trans.

In "Architecture," Loos likens the gradual evolution in the language of forms of architecture and design to changes in fashion. The emphasis here lies once more on the slowness of true stylistic change, which occurs only to reflect a changed relation between need, function, and form. In architecture the style of 1900 will necessarily have changed with respect to the previous century only as much as the tailcoat suit of 1800 has needed to be adapted to the needs of 1900, and this is not much, Loos insists. As he concludes, "The building had to look unobtrusive [<i>unauff&#x000E4;llig</i>]. Had I not once said, modern dress is that which draws least attention to itself [<i>auffallen</i>]" (<i>OA</i>, 81). What is true for clothing is also true for the house, namely, that it should find its contemporary style in a quest for fitting into its environment that takes into consideration the trend toward simplicity and functionality of the times.

Loos's discourse on women especially targets the bourgeois middle class. In his eyes, women's confinement to the home in the role of housekeepers and child-rearers represents a waste of human potential. The end of the article "Ladies' Fashion" suggests that women should have the chance to put their talents to work not because of some inner purpose that defines them as individuals, but because the progress of civilization depends on the material self-realization of all individuals and the efficient use of resources. In other words, Loos draws on an economic argument. His pragmatic, evolutionary take on this issue is further documented in the essay "Die Frau und das Haus" (Women and the house), in <i>Die Potemkische Stadt. Verschollene Schriften 1897-1933,</i> ed. Adolf Opel (Vienna: Prachner, 1983),69-74. Here Loos suggests that if gender roles are dictated by a specialization of labor that relegates women to the private sphere, then at least women should assume the function of aesthetic educators for their husbands and limit the time they spend on needless chores such as cooking elaborate dishes. The point is not that women have some innate predisposition for art, but that their specialized role in society should be reinterpreted so as to make a better use of their time. Loos does not argue against specialization per se, but against waste and for a reform of gender roles that will ensure a more fulfilling and productive use of everybody's talents. See also Loos's arguments against those who would like to mandate long hair for women based on an essentializing view of gender identity in "Short Hair" , (<i>OC,</i> 190).

Roth has reconstructed Loos's economic arguments, which are most comprehensively unfolded in his lecture "Ornament and Crime." Roth offers a thorough and careful analysis of Loos's aesthetics of everyday culture, which is in his eyes driven by an economic ethos that fosters the self-realization of the individual as a means to achieve the well-being of society at large. This ethos is a mix of meaningful individual work and an effective use of resources in addressing ever more complex human needs and the economic conditions of capitalism. When it comes to discussing Loos's conceptualization of individual and collective identity that would provide the final legitimation for such an economic ethos, Roth feels compelled to draw the conventional connection between Loos and Kraus/Weininger, however. This leads him to suggest that Loos was influenced by Weininger's 

<b></b>

distinction between a lower and a higher human nature. Accordingly Loos drew a line between a lower sphere of material everyday culture and a higher sphere of art and spiritual fulfillment. This would be akin to Kant's dualism of empirical and ideal world, or matter and spirit. For Roth, Loos's economization of resources and labor aimed at freeing human potential for the higher, spiritual sphere of art, invested with quasi-religious qualities. See Roth, <i>Adolf Loos</i>, 199-220. It is quite telling that for this argument Roth mainly relies on an extensive discussion of Weininger's thought. His attempt to draw a comparison to allegedly similar ideas in Loos's writings relies on conjectures and interpretive extrapolations that are uncharacteristic of his otherwise close discussion of Loos's texts. While it is true that Loos distinguishes the function of everyday aesthetics from that of high art, the two are never placed in a hierarchical order. Moreover, the notion of everyday life as belonging to some lower part of human nature was alien to Loos, who was instead constantly intent on emphasizing the specific pleasures and beauty of everyday culture.

Karlheinz Stockhausen's <i>Gesang der J&#x000FC;nglinge</i> (1955-56 [Song of the youths]) is often hailed as the first masterpiece of electronic music. In the same breath, it is lauded for making technological breakthroughs. Rarely, if ever, heard is the account of a composition that takes imposing risks. Masterpieces and breakthroughs do face uncertainties. The former, as lionized in accounts of the premi&#x000E8;res of the Beethoven symphonies and the outrage greeting Stravinsky's <i>The Rite of Spring,</i> are works that leap into unknown aesthetic domains, typically leaving the audience behind. Breakthroughs cap off an experimental process, in which new procedures lead to either failures or advances. <i>Gesang</i> makes both of these gambles, yet, at the same time, it engages in a different kind of risk, one with ramifications not only for electronic music but also for modernism. Stockhausen attempts to bring together the antipodal sound worlds of electronic timbres and the human voice. This effort can be seen as part of a larger precarious undertaking in late modernist arts involving a union of the abstract idioms pursued by modernism with the familiar, recognizable elements it had discarded.
</p>

<p>
A brief history of electronic music prior to <i>Gesang</i> provides a clearer understanding of the challenges confronted by the work.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In the years after World War II, the technological resources arose to make electronic music a sustained and growing field of composition.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  So quickly had this field grown that by the early 1950s two main approaches had formed: <i>musique concr&#x000E8;te</i> and pure electronic music. Based in Paris, the former drew upon recordings of natural, or "concrete," sounds, those heard in the everyday world like a man singing or a train whistle. By manipulating 

<b></b>

sounds through various means (layering or playing them backwards, for instance), composers could have listeners experience the sonic world around them in strikingly new ways. The latter approach, often blankly called electronic music, created sounds artificially in the studio, noises solely electronic in origin. With these timbres, composers could have listeners enter into a new and unknown sonic world.
</p>

<p>
Before composing <i>Gesang,</i> Stockhausen had pursued both approaches. As a student in Paris, he composed his one and only <i>musique concr&#x000E8;te</i> piece, <i>Etude</i> . The work notably does not build upon the recognizable sounds favored by <i>musique concr&#x000E8;te</i> composers. It takes the sounds of piano strings being hit by a metal beater and elaborately manipulates them so that they come across as blips and bursts of static. In other words, the acoustic has been made to sound electronic. Not surprisingly, Stockhausen turned to pure electronic composition. After his return to Germany, he settled in the studio of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) in Cologne, the base of that school. His <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II</i> (1953, 1954) incorporate a range of synthesized tones. Their artificiality and foreignness attracted Stockhausen, who, as he later recalled, was seeking to create music "<i>ex nihilo,</i>" attempting "to compose neither known rhythms nor melodies nor harmonic combinations nor res; in other words, to avoid everything which is familiar, generally known or reminiscent of music already composed."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Nothingness loomed large for Stockhausen and other young European artists who lived through the war as children. It was all they were left with at the end of the conflict: their legacy. At the same time, they could use nothingness&#x02014;artistic spaces devoid of the past&#x02014;to separate themselves from the years leading up to that catastrophe.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In the void, they could start over. Fervent modernist innovation, the kind agitated for at the famous Darmstadt festival at which Stockhausen and other young composers met, could provide that buffer.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  As boldly announced in the quotation above, this brand of modernism strove to cast off not only vestiges of the past but also the slightest traces of the familiar. Electronic idioms, so new and alien, could easily accomplish that goal, as could the integral serial idioms calculated by these composers. In the latter compositional approach, the highly intricate serial organization of pitch (the twelve-tone row), dynamics, rhythm, and other parameters, obviates the formation of conventional-sounding melodic or rhythmic gestures. <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II,</i> along with a few other contemporary electronic works, employ such complex serial schemes to piece together synthesized sounds. With the one approach compounding the other, musical engagement with nothingness was pushed to an extreme.
</p>

<p>
This type of nothingness proved extreme even for Stockhausen. After those two works, he felt the need to incorporate familiar elements into his electronic music, having them serve as points around which the listener could orient him or herself in the alien sonic surroundings.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Stockhausen reached out to familiar sounds in <i>Gesang,</i> the electronic work immediately following the two <i>Studien</i>.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The piece combines electronic sounds with the voice of a boy reading and singing the text of the <i>Benedicite,</i> the song of praise drawn from the biblical story of the three youths thrown in the fiery furnace (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The most human of sounds, the voice, and a familiar religious text could be easily perceived by listeners.

The inclusion of the voice raises challenges and risks. In particular, the challenge was how to bring together sounds which previously had been isolated from each other, cordoned off in separate, even inimical, spheres. There were no established ideas to guide such a merger. As we will see, Stockhausen reached for means used in previous works, specifically integral serial designs and sonic transformation. But would they now be enough? If not, the sound world could disintegrate into fractious bits. Besides fragmentary discord, the danger of one element overwhelming the other arose. The foreignness of the electronic noises could envelop the voice and expunge its familiarity, or the voice could so absorb the listener that the electronic sounds could fade into the background.
</p>

<p>
In his searching account of modernist visual art, T. J. Clark raises similar questions about a group of paintings by Jackson Pollock. He focuses on a series of works from 1947 to 1950 in which a cluster of recognizable images&#x02014;the human re, masks, animal shapes&#x02014;intrude upon the daedal drips of paint.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The appearance of images in an abstract scheme that had become almost sacrosanct for some critics and artists stirred much commentary at the time and continues to do so. Echoing Clement Greenberg, Clark finds these elements to be "risky" (<i>FI,</i> 345-6). To him, the risks emerge from the difficulties of bringing together the re and the abstract. The re had long disappeared from Pollock's work, being almost a distant memory of a world before the rise of his monumental abstraction. To bring it back and incorporate it into the abstract designs would seem to pose an insurmountable challenge. According to Clark, Pollock's solution was to "reconcile" the re and abstract through less than reconciliatory means. The two negate each other. The spontaneous throwing of paint already served as a negation of the re, pushing it aside and off the canvas, seemingly for good. Now brought back to that space, the re contravenes those patterns, reasserting a pictorial scheme in which it is primary. As such, the re functions as "the negation of a negation" (<i>FI,</i> 344).
</p>

<p>
Clark's account encourages us to explore how Stockhausen's piece responds to larger tensions in modernism. Surely there is a parallel to be drawn between the electronic work and paintings. Where to draw those lines, however, may not be immediately clear. To facilitate the comparison, two broad categories can be proposed: the abstract and the familiar. Admittedly those terms are vague and quite unconventional in relation to music (although less so with respect to electronic music). In a general sense, music is abstract, not being able to depict or narrate things in any specific way. The term is used here to convey a particular inscrutability, like that which electronic sound had for 1950s audiences and continues to have for some present-day listeners. The abstract, consistent with Stockhausen's <i>ex nihilo</i> music, is a realm devoid of any elements that we can recognize and connect to known entities&#x02014;such as the spaces created in fields of pure electronic sound or, as with Pollock, dripped paint. In other words, the abstract is a realm untouched by the familiar, which conversely can be viewed as the known and identifiable, anything from a boy's voice to the human re. So familiar are these elements that they, as Stockhausen counted on, stand out even in the most foreign of surroundings. Or to view things from the other side, those surroundings 

<b></b>

give the elements the quality of being generally familiar, a quality in addition to their specific connotations.
</p>

<p>
Stockhausen frequently used these categories in describing his early electronic music. <i>Hymnen</i> (1966-67), for instance, thrives on the contrast between borrowed national anthems, "the most familiar music imaginable," and electronic sounds, "which make a completely abstract impression and are not reminiscent of anything"<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In the sound worlds created by the composer, the abstract and the familiar serve as opposite points, very distant points as made clear by the superlatives attached to them. <i>Gesang</i> and the electronic works following it, including <i>Hymnen,</i> explore the space between and around those remote poles.
</p>

<p>
This study also uses the terms as sonic and conceptual poles around which the different elements in <i>Gesang</i> circulate. Not only do the various sounds (ethereal electronics, child's song) gather at those poles but so do related categories. Some of these categories form oppositions which divide along the abstract/familiar split. There are three such oppositions. The first is purity/impurity. Modernist abstraction often claimed the status of purity by concentrating on intrinsic means and gestures. Anything outside of this narrow purview&#x02014;the things we know, or the familiar&#x02014;is consigned to the impure. Yet drawing a line between the two proves difficult, as <i>Gesang</i> is so invested in the idea of purity that even the "impure" becomes pure. Another opposition is electronic sound versus speech: the alien, indecipherable timbral flow versus the jut of familiar words and ideas. Finally, there is machine and childhood. The terms are far removed from notions of the abstract and the familiar yet they too divide along the lines of those two broad categories. The machine is a realm of technology and precision capable of producing the electronic sounds, whereas childhood is one of naturalness and innocence called to mind by the boy's voice.
</p>

<p>
With the terminology and specific elements in place, we can examine how <i>Gesang</i> and Pollock's paintings respond to the risks of using the familiar. A key difference quickly emerges. Pollock's paintings have the two categories stare off at each other across a great divide. The encounter amounts to a draw. In <i>Gesang,</i> there is much movement between the two poles, with all three related oppositions heading toward the side of the abstract, be it the pure, electronic sound, or the machine. The piece's commitment to modernist ideals of abstraction pushes the oppositions toward that point. The individual pairs, though, take separate routes, some direct, others circuitous. Moreover, some of the pairs drive further into the abstract than others. With each opposition going a different way, the movement to the abstract becomes not so clear or straightforward.
</p>

<p>
As Clark states, there are no set solutions to the risks and challenges posed by the merger of the abstract and the familiar. Each work is on its own (<i>FI,</i> 351). By looking at the choices made in individual works, we can begin to see a larger picture of the modernist negotiation of those categories. The picture is especially interesting in regard to res like Pollock and Stockhausen who opened up the highly insular and abstract idioms of the 1940s and 1950s to recognizable elements. A study of <i>Gesang</i> also throws light on specific musical modernist scenes. In particular, it offers a broader 

<b></b>

understanding of the aesthetic and cultural currents stirred by early electronic music. Finally, we can reach a more encompassing view of Darmstadt modernism, one which includes a well-known side of that music, the confident and aggressive avant-garde idioms, as well as a new side: vulnerable idioms which need and take on risks.

<p class="noIndent">
Before turning to the relationship between the abstract and the familiar in <i>Gesang,</i> a few introductory remarks about the sonic materials and organizational schemes of the work are in order. Capitalizing on the new technologies at the WDR, Stockhausen created a plethora of electronic timbres. As with <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II,Gesang</i> incorporates sine tones, single pitch sonorities with no varied colors or overtones.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Those simple tones sit at one end of a sonic spectrum. White noise, a wrangle of sounds within a vast range of frequencies, sits at the other end. Between these two extremes lie impulse sonorities, which are single, percussive tones featuring a rapid natural decay. Stockhausen either presents these sonorities as isolated blips or combines them into thick "swarms" (<i>scharen</i>).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Moving from one end of the sonic spectrum to the other, he not surprisingly moves sound itself. For the original performances, five individual tracks were shuttled through loudspeakers positioned around the hall (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Sounds never remain stationary; they overlap each other and dart from corner to corner.
</p>

<p>
To unite these volatile electronic sounds with a human voice, Stockhausen held fast to the ideals of integral serialism, expanding them to deal with an unprecedented range of sonorities. The makeup of individual sounds as well as the relationships between them could be serially defined.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Even the voice could be pressed into a structural scheme. To that end, Stockhausen established an ordered series of seven degrees of comprehensibility, ranging from clearly understood syllables and words to raucous sonorities comprised of overlapped vocal parts.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  For Stockhausen, both the voice and electronics were part of a larger sonic continuum.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  As described above, the simple sine tone sat at one end of that continuum and hectic white noise at the other. Different forms of speech fall between these points. Isolated syllables and words stay close to the sine tones, whereas superimposed vocal sonorities push toward the other end. These outer ranges fascinated Stockhausen as did the vast middle ground. In the latter, elements blur, to the point that speech takes on aspects of electronic sound, and sound assumes qualities of speech. 
</p>

<p>
Stockhausen divides <i>Gesang</i> into six sections which can be labeled A-F (see <a href="#3"> 3</a>).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  He had originally planned and sketched out a seventh concluding G section but did not have the time to finish it, leaving the work, as we hear it, incomplete. The junctures between the individual units are demarcated by either dense impulse swarms or silences. Stockhausen contrasts the sections by the treatment of the voice. Each one highlights a specific manipulation of the vocal material. Overall, there are four basic manipulations: clear syllables and words; vocal chords (massed, roughly homophonic groupings of individual lines), vocal polyphony (divergent lines), and choral swarms (very dense and unruly combinations of separate vocal parts).<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The opening A section

introduces the categories of syllables and words, chords, and swarms. Each of the following four units concentrates on a particular category: swarms (B), syllables and words (C), chords (D), and polyphony (E). The final F section serves as a timbral and formal summation (even without the planned G section), bringing together all the vocal categories and a wide range of electronic sounds. In this section, Stockhausen also structurally realizes the sound continuum, as he breaks it down into twelve fixed segments which can be combined to form larger sonic groups.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  These groups are dispersed across the F section in a predetermined order. Quick cuts between these disparate strands create a vacillating timbral surface, the rapid tremors of which bring the work to a close.

Purity
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Purity holds many promises&#x02014;among them, ideals of essence and wholeness. Desirous of those qualities, several streams of modernism not surprisingly sought to win them. Writing on the modernist paintings prized by Greenberg, Donald Kuspit has depicted modernism as "the point of view which sees art as the mastery of purity."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Such "mastery" emerges sharply in works which push the drive for purity to extremes by restricting themselves to one basic material. <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II</i> arrive at such a point; however, they do not fix on just any material but rather on a fundamental one: the sine tone. In the early years of electronic music, that sound captivated. It was held up as elemental, a sound of exact pitch with no overtones, existing at the core of all sounds.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Herbert Eimert, one of the composers active at the WDR, called it a "pure element," beyond which there was nothing purer or smaller.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Eimert and other composers, including Stockhausen, realized that this "purity" was ultimately unattainable, as listeners would always hear additional overtones and colors.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Nonetheless, composers worked with these sonic "atoms," seeing them as the building blocks of a new music.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fusion of sine tones in the two <i>Studien</i> did produce a new music, but that music proved hollow and was later abandoned. The pale sonic flow in both works makes us wonder if purity, to turn Kuspit's words around, did not gain mastery over electronic music. When pursued in such extreme states&#x02014;and how else can it be&#x02014;purity leads a work into vacuity. The idea takes over, becoming the essence of the piece. Adorno called the emphasis on purity "a technocratic attitude" which speaks of "something entirely too binding, violent, and unartistic."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  For Kuspit, the notion of purity seduces less by technical means than by being an "opiate," one which "dulls" the mind with sterility.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Can purity escape this solipsistic void? As depicted by Adorno and Kuspit, it cannot. Approaches to purity in different fields, particularly anthropology, suggest otherwise. Mary Douglas's classic <i>Purity and Danger</i> describes how cultural systems of purity can be "shattered and renewed."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  She would agree with critics of modernist arts that purity can be "hard and dead as a stone" (<i>PD,</i> 161). The stone, however, can be more brittle than hard, as it breaks apart from emptiness and contradictions. At that

moment, the whole system collapses, but it can be salvaged by welcoming back that which had been rejected, in other words, the impure. Douglas mentions the ancient Hebrew Temple, which dismissed bodily fluids as grossly unclean only to allow blood to cross the sacred threshold, as long as it was treated in special ways (<i>PD,</i> 159). The use of blood brings together the pure and the impure, "an act of one-ment" going beyond the significance of a specific ritual. According to Douglas, such unions nullify the divisiveness upon which the demand for purity thrives and uphold a larger "combination of opposites," which proves a "satisfying" "psychological" and "religious" act (<i>PD,</i> 169). For <i>Gesang,</i> the union of electronic sound and human voice is no less profound. As realized in the design of the sonic continuum, the merger broadens and deepens levels of unity, a "satisfying" state for serial composers, for whom the term "unity" was a mantra. Some composers did indeed view unity as a religious state. Stockhausen and Karl Goeyvaerts, two ardent Catholics at the time, viewed musical unity, particularly the schemes of integral serialism, as emulating a "divine perfection."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There is one significant difference between Douglas's model of renewal and the path taken by <i>Gesang</i>. In the former, the pure reaches out to the impure, whereas, in the musical work, the pure reaches out to the pure. The two elements entering the electronic sound world&#x02014;a child's voice and a biblical text&#x02014;bear strong associations of purity. By virtue of being outside of the electronic realm they are foreign, and therefore impure; however, in the larger cultural realm in which <i>Gesang</i> operates, they epitomize purity. The boy's voice not only captures the innocence and naturalness by which society defines childhood but it is also a pure sound, a voice with little or no vibrato&#x02014;a human sine tone, as it were. The biblical text obviously signifies the holy. It, though, is not just pure but is also about purity, presenting many different forms of the state. The youths thrown into the furnace embody childhood innocence.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  They are made even more so by the fire, which refines, or purifies, them by bringing them into contact with the divine, the angel encountered in the flames. That presence turns them into fonts of religious faith, pouring out a florid song of praise. Their song calls out the "works of the Lord," which include pure elements, like water (in its various forms of rain, dew, snow, and ice), air, and fire.
</p>

<p>
Instead of purity, <i>Gesang</i> gives us purities. They take different forms, including both particular qualities (the sound of the sine tone) and concepts (childhood and the sacred). Why reach out to this plurality? A fear of impurity could be one reason. Any element brought into the electronic sphere would be considered impure. Outside materials, though, were needed. One way to stave off the threat of impurity would be to incorporate elements culturally embedded in the pure. Purity could reinforce purity, especially one which, like electronic sound, was felt to be deficient. From a different perspective, the panoply of purities stems from what could be called modernist audacity. Although <i>Gesang</i> stakes out a new type of purity (that of electronic sound), it is still not satisfied. It wants more and gets it by gilding itself with other pure elements, ones far removed from the sonic essences it seeks. Even venerable forms of purity, like a child's voice and a sacred text, can be taken apart and refashioned to complement the new sonic order.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This multiplicity raises the question of whether or not different forms of purity can coexist.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Indeed, can purity, a supposedly singular state, contain such diversity? In regard to <i>Gesang,</i> these questions can be better answered by shifting the focus away from the different materials&#x02014;sine tone, electronic sound, child's voice, biblical text&#x02014;to the means by which those purities are achieved. Purity is as much an action as it is an inherent state. It is achieved through some means and those means determine the ways in which it relates to the impure, the outside world. Or, in the case of <i>Gesang,</i> the means reveal how the pure relates to the pure.
</p>

<p>
Prized as elemental and atomlike, the sine tone appears to possess a natural purity. That sound exists by itself, hidden at the center of all sounds. In other words, it is not made. Or is it? Its purity is achieved by a certain means, that of reduction. Discussing <i>Studie I,</i> Stockhausen remarked, "We reduced everything to the element, which is the basis for the variety of sound; the pure soundwave, electrically producible, called 'sine wave.'" <sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  To get at these atoms, a sound must be diminished, its thick timbral layers boiled off. Even when these layers have been removed, the sine tone does not exist. It has to be electronically produced, or synthesized. It is nothing more than an acoustic ideal&#x02014;a wave pattern&#x02014;given sonic life in the studio, no different from the other electronic timbres in <i>Gesang</i>. All the electronic sounds, from sine tones to impulse swarms, result from a related means of achieving purity: exclusion. Sharing an antipathy toward the extraneous, exclusion and reduction overlap. However, there are some differences. Whereas reduction gradually removes the contingent, exclusion outright rejects it. Electronic sounds are created in a separate sphere, the studio. From the outset, they have been set apart. Upon beginning at the WDR, Stockhausen isolated them in the refined sound worlds of <i>StudienI</i> and <i>II</i>. In such pieces, and in certain moments of <i>Gesang,</i> electronic sound becomes what Stockhausen calls "pure sound," a realm where sound is no longer tied to, or contaminated by, the known but rather exists in and by itself ("MS," 160). Electronic music achieves its essence, becoming sound about sound.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to electronic sound, childhood&#x02014;signified by the boy's voice&#x02014;is a natural form of purity. Children are born pure, a belief reinforced by cultural discourses of childhood.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  This purity, however, is fragile and short-lived. It perishes, succumbing to the defiled adult world around it. Childhood exists more as the threat of impurity than as a means of purity. If childhood purity is shaped by any action, it is that of loss. The danger of violation makes the pure all the more cherished and protected, and thus more frail.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the biblical text imparts a sacred purity. Unlike other forms of the pure, that state does not arise from a specific means. The sacred, as conveyed in religious traditions, is not created; it has always existed and will never change. It is eternal. <i>Gesang,</i> or any mortal creation, can obviously never commandeer this quality, only evoke it. The text, however, does point to a mode of purity that can be incorporated. The tale of the fiery furnace describes how the flames refine the youths, making them even more pure. Refinement functions as another important means of purity, one by which the impure, or even the pure, can be elevated into a higher form.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
We can now return to the question posed earlier as to whether or not different types of purity can coexist. It appears that they can, but only so far as one means of attaining the state dominates. The case of <i>Gesang</i> suggests that a single mode is needed to create a relationship between the different materials, especially between the child's voice and the electronic sounds. The question becomes which one will govern <i>Gesang</i>. In some ways, the answer depends on how you hear the relationship between those two defining materials.
</p>

<p>
Many of the early reviewers of <i>Gesang</i> held to the purity of childhood. Their interpretations are built around that ideal, revealing how purity, or one particular notion of it, can dominate perceptions of the work. To these critics, electronic sound could never possess purity, being so far removed from nature and the beautiful. If anything, these sounds corrupted and distorted the pure, as heard in the treatment of the boy's voice. Several reviewers paint vivid scenes in which the voice is polluted, becoming an unnatural, even grotesque noise, no different than the electronic timbres. Purity, as it takes form in this work, exists as loss, that which is made impure. According to one critic, the voice, "a gift of the divine," was subjected to the "perverse possibilities" of the electronic equipment, which damned it to a "hellish" sound world.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Another reviewer describes how the boy's voice, again a gift from God, was treated in ways going "against nature," mutilated into "howls" and "groans." <sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The homage to divine gifts reveals how some critics also appealed to the purity of the sacred, enshrining both the boy's voice and biblical text in it. The sacred elevates the voice, thereby allowing reviewers to dramatize its corruption. 
</p>

<p>
The idea of electronic sound purifying the boy's voice would have struck these critics as sacrilege. There is some truth, though, in this blasphemy, as it captures the way <i>Gesang</i> approaches the relationship between those two elements. The piece clearly holds to the ideal of purity. Out of all the depicted means of securing that state, it adheres to one: refinement. The biblical story is not lost on the work. <i>Gesang,</i> however, rewrites the tale&#x02014;yet more blasphemy. Having brought in outside materials, be they pure or impure, the work must make them suitable for the pure realm of electronic sound. <i>Gesang</i> surrounds the child's voice with electronic fire. The blaze, unlike the biblical furnace, does not enhance the voice's own purity; rather, the boy's voice feeds the flames, enhancing the purity of electronic sound. The voice is not so much transformed into divine song as into sounds similar to the electronic timbres. In this form of the story, the burning youths purify the flames.
</p>

<p>
Douglas's study offers insights into this process of refinement. As she describes, the impure can only be brought into the sphere of the pure when handled in specific ways. For instance, the blood used in the Hebrew Temple had to be shed in sacrifice. By following established laws, the outside element can be lifted to the level of the pure (<i>PD,</i> 159). In this elevation, it takes on new qualities, either by assuming different associations (that of sacrifice) or by being directly transformed. <i>Gesang</i> is ruled by a set of laws, by various serial schemes. Stockhausen, to recall, viewed those schemes in general as pointing toward a "divine perfection." Such "perfection" demands purity. Not surprisingly, sine tones were offered to the serial designs of <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II,</i> pure 

<b></b>

tones that could complement those laws and be easily molded to accord with them. A voice, a sound following its own distinct rules, would seem to resist such treatment. Yet it too ultimately follows "the chosen musical order."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  As Stockhausen declares, "the sung speech sounds, like all the electronic sounds, follow formal musical laws."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In other words, the voice must become like an electronic sound in order to adhere to the same "laws" that those sounds do. Its purity must be changed, or refined, into electronic sound. The change occurs at the outset of <i>Gesang</i>. The voice is broken down into basic parts, vowels, consonants, and flecks of timbre. Those bits can easily be transformed and combined to create new sounds. In other words, the voice proves just as elemental, fragmentary, and malleable as the electronic components. It takes on aspects of being "pure" sound, and, as such, it adds to that purity but is never completely subsumed into it. No matter how scrambled and disjointed the text becomes, semantic meaning, the chatter of the impure, hovers around the voice, as words and syllables can be heard here and there. Moreover, a child's voice is a very distinct timbre, one not easily dissolved. Nor does Stockhausen want to erase the voice, for it, in its more distinctive and intelligible forms, anchors one end of the sonic spectrum. As the piece progresses, though, the voice drifts further and further to the other end, caught in the dense rushes of sound in the final F section. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Gesang</i>, though, never settles down at that endpoint. It resists the finality of the pure. Refinement&#x02014;the attainment of purity&#x02014;is held back by a fear of purity, specifically the hollowness of <i>StudienI</i> and <i>II,</i> a condition to which Stockhausen had no desire to return. At the same time, a fear of impurity clutches the work. This anxiety perhaps impelled the piece to reach out to the child's voice and biblical text rather than just any foreign elements. It also demands that <i>Gesang</i> attempt to refine those materials, to make them assimilate to the world of electronic sound. Only a piece so obsessed with purity could get caught in those conflicting fears and needs, being pulled in opposite directions by the ideal. 
</p>

<p>
Where does this tug of war leave the relationship between the familiar and the abstract? <i>Gesang,</i> as mentioned earlier, drives toward the abstract. But, when viewed from the perspective of the purity/impurity opposition, the movement toward that side is not so far-reaching or clear, as both the familiar and the abstract lay claim to purity. Moreover, the purities of the boy's voice and biblical text resist complete refinement, thereby strengthening the presence of the familiar. Finally, the mixture of different purities makes it difficult to keep the two categories distinct. Modernist works, like the two <i>Studien,</i> typically equate purity and abstraction. <i>Gesang</i> rejects that equation, but it still clings to the abstract and the pure. Instead of having a single state of purity define the abstract (the two being one), the work has different types of purity loosely conform to a single notion of the abstract&#x02014;that of electronic sound. This manifold purity somehow holds together in <i>Gesang,</i> but it does not lend itself to other compositions. It would be difficult to recreate this broadly pure and abstract world with each new piece. In fact, Stockhausen never again did.

Speech and Sound
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Speech disrupts musical works. When the spoken word enters, a piece usually grinds to a halt or music slinks subserviently into the background. The most clearly articulated flow of verbal thought demands attention, crowding out the vaguer discourse of music. So clear and comprehensible, speech obviously represents the familiar. As such, it threatens to overpower any abstract idiom that reaches out to it. Stockhausen faced this danger. How could electronic sounds, which were so foreign and obscure, stand up to a voice? Speech/sound would appear to be a rather lopsided way of ring the relationship between the familiar and the abstract. In <i>Gesang</i>, though, the two intertwine and overlap, taking on aspects of each other, with sound eventually having the upper hand. In order to understand this dynamic, we need to focus on two specific relationships: speech and electronic technologies, and speech and music. Only after discussing them can we turn to the interaction between speech and electronic music, a relationship that Stockhausen was instrumental in forging.
</p>

<p>
During the early years of the WDR, much of the scientific and musical research conducted there focused on speech.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Werner Meyer-Eppler, a professor of phonetics, spearheaded those efforts. He had a strong interest in using recent electronic technologies to analyze the minute components of speech. Some of the same machines, as he and Eimert realized, could also be employed to produce sounds for musical use. Meyer-Eppler's innovative approaches to phonetics and new technologies attracted many students, including Stockhausen, who attended his classes between 1954 and 1956 and began a doctorate under him. It is safe to say that the breaking apart and molding of speech through new technologies in <i>Gesang</i> is indebted to Meyer-Eppler.
</p>

<p>
Not only could machines analyze speech but they could also synthesize it. The speaking machine had been a long-standing technological goal, the pursuit of which extends back to at least the eighteenth century. <sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Two recent efforts in this endeavor had found their way into the WDR circles: the Vocoder (Voice Operated Recorder, 1936) and Voder (Voice Operating Demonstrator, 1939).<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The former required a human voice to initiate the process, breaking down the voice into data and processing it into an electronic form. The Voder took a crucial step by not requiring a human source. Controlled by a human operator, it manipulated formulated speech sounds, approximations of vowels and consonants, to create its own voice. Interest in the devices at the WDR proved relatively short-lived (new technologies were always being unveiled) but they nonetheless became part of the stream of ideas flowing in and around the studio.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In particular, the machines demonstrated how speech could be parsed into distinct sounds, a fragmentation taken further in <i>Gesang</i>. Above all, they proclaimed that machines could speak, a declaration that Stockhausen's piece also extends by developing its own form of speech. 
</p>

<p>
Speech and electronic technology was a new relationship. Speech and music, in contrast, was an age-old bond, and that is one of the reasons it was so challenging for integral serial composers. In order to understand that challenge, we must expand our conception of speech to encompass language in general, whether it be spoken, sung, 

<b></b>

or read. Stockhausen approached the term just as broadly in a 1958 article entitled "Musik und Sprache" (Music and language).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  We, however, should not overlook the spoken word, for it res prominently in <i>Gesang,</i> being the form of "language" at the heart of the work. In their initial experimental fervor, integral serial composers largely rejected language, focusing on instrumental or purely electronic works. They may have done so out of concern that the semantic proliferation of a text would jam the precise inner workings of serial schemes and violate the isolation sought in a higher abstract order. Yet composers did turn to texts, as seen in two classic works of the 1950s, <i>Gesang</i> and Pierre Boulez's <i>Le Marteau sans ma&#x000EE;tre</i> (1955 [The hammer without a master]).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Voices were needed to deliver those texts. Earlier integral serial works had also dismissed the voice, rejecting the conventional feel of lyricism it imparted and perhaps fearing that it might dominate the ensemble and disrupt the calculated parity of parts.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  By welcoming the voice, composers could not help but deal with the lyricism and expression of text characterizing centuries of vocal music.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The question was how to handle those venerable qualities in the newly chiseled abstract idioms.
</p>

<p>
Stockhausen addressed this question head-on in the succinctly titled "Musik und Sprache" article. He discussed the solutions found in <i>Gesang</i>, <i>Le Marteau</i>, and Luigi Nono's <i>Il canto sospeso</i> (1956 [The song suspended])&#x02014;three pieces by Darmstadt composers. In describing the other two composers' approaches, Stockhausen was really offering his own solution, one not surprisingly in agreement with the path plotted for speech in <i>Gesang</i>. According to him, all three works enact a "transition from speech to music," in which the text dissolves to the point of becoming almost incomprehensible and the voice may fade away altogether ("MS," 44). As depicted by Stockhausen, Boulez and Nono's pieces take speech to a vanishing point. In <i>Le Marteau,</i> the voice of the alto soloist gradually disappears, to the point that she sings with her mouth closed (becoming a "speechless instrument" according to Stockhausen), and finishes the work silenced in the ensemble, sitting out the final section. The second movement of Nono's work, according to Stockhausen, almost completely dissolves the text through the style of setting the words (splitting up syllables between individual parts in the choir) and by subsuming the words (especially the vowel sounds) into a larger serial design so that they become almost indistinguishable.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  By placing <i>Gesang</i> last in his discussion of the three pieces, Stockhausen appears to be holding it up as some sort of culmination. In many ways it is. With the electronic technologies, we can go beyond the vanishing point and cross over into a realm where speech disappears into music and "music can approach speech" ("MS, 59). The following analysis discusses how <i>Gesang</i> passes that point and what happens to the relationship between speech and electronic music in the next realm. 
</p>

<p>
The interaction between the two elements took shape well before the final version of <i>Gesang</i> was ever completed. The recording of the child's voice is an intriguing, and largely unknown, aspect of the work. Stockhausen chose the twelve-year-old Josef Protschka to sing the vocal parts for the piece. He realized, though, that those parts proved too difficult for any musician, child or adult. They were largely conceived in terms appropriate for electronic music. The pitches are not fixed in scale degrees but 

<b></b>

rather in acoustical frequencies, many of them falling between the twelve chromatic pitches, and the rhythmic durations are realized in centimeters (tape lengths) instead of standard notation. Stockhausen aimed to surmount these difficulties by executing the parts with sine tones and then playing back the recording of those tones to Protschka, who listened to them with headphones and then sang them back to the best of his ability. Protschka was in some cases given sheets that provided the text and general melodic contour of a phrase, along with frequency and centimeter markings (<a href="#4"> 4</a>).<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The recording sessions lasted around three hours each. Stockhausen selected the best takes and then transformed them to fit the context of a specific passage in the work.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What is striking about this recording session is how it reassigns the traditional roles between the voice and electronic technology. The latter typically services the voice or remains beholden to it. Recording equipment reproduces the voice, trying to do so as faithfully as possible. The Vocoder appears to have gained some autonomy by generating speech, but it still depends on the human voice as a source. Even the Voder relies on replicas of human speech, vowel and consonant sounds, to create an approximate version of that source. In these various cases, the voice is never the subaltern to technology. Yet in the recording session, and in <i>Gesang</i> itself, the voice plays that role. Protschka in many ways becomes a Vocoder, taking in the electronic sound information, processing it, and synthesizing it with his own voice. In <i>Gesang,</i> the lines between human voice and electronic technology twist even more. During the course of the work, the electronic sounds appear to draw upon the boy's voice so as to develop the ability to speak. Going well beyond the output of the Vocoder or Voder, those sounds do not imitate the voice but rather use it as a point of departure from which to create a unique form of speech. <i>Gesang</i> presents us with an intricate scheme in which a new type of electronic speech, one not resembling a human original, slowly develops.
</p>

<p>
We can follow this scheme by focusing on specific moments in the six sections of the work. <i>Gesang</i> begins with a rush of impulse tones that dwindle into a series of isolated pitches, approximately E-flat, G, G (lower range), C-sharp.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Out of the sustained E-flat emerges the voice, which sings the word "jubelt" to the pitches E-flat to B-flat, roughly the outer pitches of the electronic phrase (:05-:12).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  A few seconds later another moment of melodic imitation occurs, as the general contour of a three-pitch electronic re is taken up by the solo voice on the phrase "lobet ihn" (:26-:32). In both cases, the imitation is not exact. Nor would one expect it to be. Ever so modern and variegated, <i>Gesang</i> has little to do with such a conventional and precisely repetitive gesture as imitation. The aversion to imitation makes these two parallels, no matter how loose, all the more surprising and significant. They take us back into the studio with Protschka, hearing a child absorb electronic melodies and give them a human voice. The recording session served as the first meeting between voice and electronic sound in the creation of <i>Gesang</i>. Stockhausen appropriately restages it at the beginning of the work, where it serves again as the initial interaction between the two. By doing so, he immediately disrupts our expectations, having us hear the human voice as secondary to the electronic sounds, something that imitates those sounds.

<p>The C section opens with the first extended passage for solo speaking voice. Stockhausen slightly distorts the voice by fragmenting it so that our attention shifts to the melodic movement between isolated syllables/tones. This passage also marks the first prominent appearance of the low individual impulse sonorities which play a significant role in the piece (3:02). Like the voice, these sounds move melodically from one pitch to the next, as if enunciating lone words or syllables. In their study of the sketches and structural plans of <i>Gesang,</i> Pascal Decroupet and Elena Ungeheuer note that the spoken voice and electronic sounds in this passage have "shared organizational principles," the "melodic contour" of the latter adhering to a structure derived from the inflexions of spoken language.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  With that in mind, we can hear the impulse sonorities not just as sharing structural elements with speech but rather as actually speaking. It is not an entirely fanciful interpretation, for such sounds had strong associations with speech in the WDR.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Gy&#x000F6;rgy Ligeti's <i>Artikulation</i> , written at the studio on the heels of <i>Gesang,</i> builds "an imaginary conversation" for just electronic 

<b></b>

sounds&#x02014;no human voices chime in. Those timbres, as he puts it, have "speechlike results."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Among the first "words" in that conversation are low impulse sonorities, sounds that get the discussion off to a quick and engaging start.
</p>

<p>
These sonorities also form the "first words" in <i>Gesang</i>. It is perhaps not coincidental that those words emerge during a patch of clear human speech. The ability to speak would not be possible without the model provided by the human voice. It offers the contours and flow upon which the electronic sounds draw. The voice also gives a context in which we can hear these impulse tones as resembling speech. So now we have the electronic sounds responding to the human voice, the opposite of the relationship set up in the recording session and at the beginning of the A section. The sounds, though, are nowhere near as pliant as the voice was in those instances. The precise pitches and contours of human speech are rarely, if at all, imitated by the electronic sounds. Electronic speech instead draws upon only general qualities of the human variety, and even then it quickly moves beyond those qualities into its own linguistic realm.
</p>

<p>
No sooner has this new language emerged than it disappears. During the following few minutes (the rest of the C and the entire D sections), <i>Gesang</i> ricochets back and forth between blocks of electronic sound and clear lines of human speech, or, as Stockhausen tellingly puts it, between "pure sound" and "pure speech."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  The distinct impulse sonorities, the carriers of electronic speech, reappear in the E section, actively bouncing around in their own conversation. The boy's voice does not participate in the discussion. It instead behaves like the electronic swarms previously did, being clotted in thick masses which interrupt the flow of electronic speech. In this topsy-turvy world, electronic sounds speak, and human voices block with bursts of noise.
</p>

<p>
The concluding F section goes beyond a mere reversal.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  The longest and most intricate part of the piece, it presents an ever-shifting mix of sounds and voices. As described earlier, Stockhausen structuralizes the governing spectrum, segmenting it into discrete units, which are combined to create constantly changing sonic strands. The rhythmic conception enhances the timbral vacillation, as the composer isolates sounds lasting from roughly one-twentieth of a second to one second.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Defined speech rarely appears, only sporadic isolated words and syllables. By this point, the human voice has almost disappeared into the mercurial world of "pure sound." Electronic speech also seems to have faded away. The low single impulse tones are still heard but they no longer dominate the conversation as they did in the C and E sections. Rather, a new form of speech, one branching out from the single impulse tones, has taken form. Those "first words" have given birth to a fecund vocabulary, as heard in the diverse range of electronic sounds, a diversity unequaled earlier in the work. Electronic speech has grown before our ears. <i>Artikulation</i> charts a similar linguistic development, beginning with lone impulse tones and concluding with a "complete mixture and interpenetration" of the various sounds heard throughout the work.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  As in <i>Gesang,</i> the final cluster grows out of the single sonorities. <i>Artikulation</i> suggests that Ligeti was attuned to the evolution of electronic speech in Stockhausen's work, as he tried to raise the process to the next level by having electronic speech develop on its own in a sound world untouched by the human voice.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
With or without the voice, both works grew out of a fascination with human speech. Composers and scientists at the WDR were fascinated by its sonic and structural complexity. According to Stockhausen, "sung speech-sounds probably represent the most complex of speech structures." Complexity was a magnet for composers already taken by intricate sounds and structures. Speech would not just inspire them but it would challenge them as well. To engage speech would require creating "much more sophisticated electronic sounds" lest those sounds, paragons of complexity themselves, pale in comparison.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup> <i>Gesang</i> and <i>Artikulation</i> respond to the challenge by creating electronic forms of speech which emulate the melodic, timbral, and rhythmic aspects of the human type. The two, however, take an even bolder step by making electronic speech increasingly complex, to the point of surpassing the prized intricacy of human speech. Once again modernist confidence, or audacity, arises. Whereas <i>Gesang</i> sought to augment its purity with the pure, it now takes on the complexity of speech and not only imitates it but also aims to exceed it. 
</p>

<p>
Discussing the subsumption of speech into music in <i>Le Marteau,</i> Stockhausen describes how the voice, with mouth closed, becomes a "speechless instrument." The voice, as suggested by his phrase, loses something in this process. It proves no different in <i>Gesang</i>. The voices in both works lose many of the same things, particularly text, intelligibility, and distinct vocal qualities. In <i>Gesang,</i> however, the voice never outright disappears, as it eventually does in <i>Le Marteau</i>. Turning things around, we can ask what happens to electronic sound when it becomes speech. Does it lose anything? Does it become "soundless speech"? On the contrary, electronic sound has much to gain. It takes on new dimensions and layers of complexity. It becomes "speaking sound." When this new form of speech has been fully attained, as it is in the F section, electronic sound is at its richest, no longer merely imitating or interrupting the human voice.
</p>

<p>
The boy's voice still pervades the final section. Why does it ring so prominently, if not clearly, now that sound has gained the ability to speak? There would seemingly be no role left for it to play. There are, though, several parts that it performs in relation to electronic speech. First, as in the C section, it operates as a constant point of comparison that highlights the speech-like affinities of the electronic sounds. In his account of <i>Il canto sospeso,</i> Stockhausen relates how "the sense of speech can only be banished to a vocal structure" when the listener can still detect it, as by hearing a "few fragmentary syllables" ("MS," 49). We need to hear speech, or traces of it, to realize how it has made the transition to a "higher" structural level. In <i>Gesang,</i> the flashes of distinct words reveal how thoroughly speech has been absorbed into electronic sound, and into a higher form of electronic speech. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, speech can never be fully "banished" for the same reason it was welcomed into the work in the first place. It mollifies abstraction. As heard in <i>Studien I</i> and <i>II,</i> electronic sound closes itself up in an abstract realm. Seeking unrivaled complexity, electronic speech tightens the enclosure. The conclusion of <i>Artikulation,</i> for instance, reaches a point of thick abstraction, a barrage of sounds. Notably the new language developed in the work died with the piece, as Ligeti never took it up again, perhaps 

<b></b>

realizing how abstruse it was. In <i>Gesang,</i> the boy's voice keeps the crust of abstraction from closing over the work by asserting the familiar. His voice provides something for the listener to grasp. It also allows us to hear the creation of a new type of speech.
</p>

<p>
When framed as speech and sound, the play between the familiar and the abstract proves quite labile. Speech moves toward sound; sound moves toward speech. Ultimately, though, the two head toward sound, the realm of the abstract. Of all the pairings discussed here, speech/sound goes furthest into that realm. The two categories are easy to discern, compared to such broad and conceptual relationships as purity/impurity and childhood/machine. With the terms so distinct, we can perceive the disintegration of speech, its pieces falling into an expanding pool of electronic timbres. By the end of the work, there is little speech left in speech. Much of it has become sound. Some of sound has also become speech, specifically electronic speech. The electronic language developed in <i>Gesang</i> quickly leaves behind the most general affinities it had with the human voice and the familiar. It instead develops its own intricate timbral lexicon. Despite being crowded by electronic sound, human speech still endures. As it must, for speech is vital to the work, being at once a carrier of meaning, a palliative to abstraction, and a linguistic model. Playing all those parts, speech restrains <i>Gesang</i> from venturing all the way into the abstract. The work, however, still makes much headway in that direction, driven there by the creation of a new form of speech.

Childhood and Machine
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The human speech resounding throughout <i>Gesang</i> belongs to a child. No matter how contorted, the spoken and sung words represent that re. The blips, swarms, and blasts filling the work belong to a machine. Ever so contorted and strange, they represent that object, noises emerging from the equipment of the WDR. Nothing but the newest machines could create such new and inhuman sounds. In this light, the boy's voice and electronic sounds give the relationship between the familiar and the abstract the guise of childhood and machine. There is seemingly no common ground between those two terms. The child plays in a sphere of simplicity and naturalness, whereas the machine grinds in a mechanical world of complexity. Innocence, that characteristic of childhood, has no presence in that world, for machines are neither innocent nor impure. Finally, children change and mature, in the processing losing their innocence. Machines, on the other hand, stay the same, awaiting a moment of obsolescence or destruction. 
</p>

<p>
So remote are the two that it appears that they could never be brought together, let alone merge into a single re, like a child robot. Indeed, out of all the different mergers of human and machine created in science, popular culture, and the arts, the child machine is relatively rare.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Like other mechanical beings, when and where it appears, it causes anxiety by blurring the lines between human and machine, especially the unsettling, if not unthinkable, idea of combining the most vulnerable and innocent stage of humanity with technological coldness and precision. The re also 

<b></b>

raises a particular fear about technological inventions: they might "grow up" as children do, becoming not so much older as more complex and powerful. The parents, or human creators, could easily lose control of their offspring. Narratives dealing with such res focus on these troubling phenomena, seeking to resolve them in some way. Attempts are made to clear up the mix, separating the parts so that we have a child or a machine.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  In many cases, the two cannot be completely disconnected, but the mix can be pushed to one side so as to dispel most of the disturbing muddle. From the mix emerges an entity more machine than child or more child than machine. With these narrative outcomes in mind, we can turn to accounts of two mechanical children from the 1950s and then to <i>Gesang</i> to see how it deals with the sonic chimera of an electronic boy's voice. These examples may be drawn from very different sources (psychological case study, comic books, electronic music) but they each respond to a larger cultural need to separate the child and the machine. 
</p>

<p>
In 1959, three years after the premiere of <i>Gesang</i>, <i>Scientific American</i> featured an article about "Joey," a "mechanical boy."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim described how "Joey," an autistic child, took on the identity of a machine as a way of dealing with the emotional muteness of his parents. As a machine, he would not have to expect any feelings from them or give any in return. An early self-portrait shows how "Joey" perceived himself, a robot with a blank stare and live-wired limbs. The article details "Joey's" mechanical persona, his surrounding himself with found parts (bulbs, tubes, and wires) and pretending that his basic bodily functions were run by machines. According to Bettelheim, the persona was so realistic that he and his staff had to "force" themselves "to realize that 'Joey' was a child" ("JMB," 117). Echoing Freud on automata, he found the spectacle to be "uncanny."<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  As Bettelheim elaborated, "a human body that functions as if it were a machine and a machine that duplicates human functions are equally fascinating and frightening" ("JMB," 117).
</p>

<p>
The article gets caught up in the spectacle, spending much time describing how "Joey" "functions as if [he] were a machine" ("JMB," 117). Unlike a conventional case study, it devotes little attention to the cure, the means by which Bettelheim got "Joey" to abandon his new identity.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Bettelheim, though, continuously points the reader in the direction of a cure. When the moment comes, it is both a clinical triumph and the fulfillment of the cultural imperative to dissolve the "mechanical boy" chimera. Such an outcome, clinical and cultural, is never in doubt. The human, especially the child, must be saved from the machine. The article reassuringly concludes, "suffice it to say that ['Joey'] ceased to be a mechanical boy and became a human child" ("JMB," 127). The naturalness of childhood has been restored, a naturalness, as Bettelheim warns, in constant peril from the difficulties of "emotional development in a machine age" ("JMB," 117).
</p>

<p>
Before there was "Joey" and <i>Gesang</i>, there was Astro Boy. In 1952, Japanese comic artist Osamu Tezuka unveiled the title character in a new comic book, which proved so popular that it took off in North America and Europe by the middle of the decade.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Tezuka's story had audiences peer into the distant future of 2003.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  It begins with a death, as the scientist Dr. Tenma has lost his son. In his grief, he tries to replace him with a robot created in the boy's image. Tenma, though, realizes that Astro Boy will 

<b></b>

never be human, and thus unable to fill his loss. The robot boy soon experiences his own sense of loss, as he is sent away, a departure that instills in him an unceasing desire to be human. He is taken in by the owner of a circus in which robots are forced to do stunts and to battle each other. Dr. Ochanomizu, a crusader for robot rights, rescues and adopts him, teaching him how to use his powers to help others. Although Astro Boy saves humans from one disaster after another, they remain frightened by him. Nonetheless, he continues to t for them so as to gain their acceptance and possibly become human himself.
</p>

<p>
Robot boys are not the only ones with that wish; wooden boys also share it. <i>Astro Boy</i> is clearly indebted to the story of Pinocchio. There is, though, a significant difference between the two: the puppet becomes a boy, the robot remains a robot. More to the point, he remains a chimera, a robot that wishes to be a boy and has child-like qualities, the soft eyes and prankish spirit. The comic book does not completely resolve the re. To do so would bring an abrupt halt to the narrative, as seen in both the Pinocchio tale and "Joey's" case study. It instead skews the mixture of machine and human heavily to the side of the machine, so as to give us some clarity while keeping up traces of the beguiling mix. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Gesang</i> unleashes a chimerical voice. The voice sounds like a child one moment and electronic noise the next. The two supposedly antithetical sounds inhabit a single voice, one emerging from the mouth of the machine: the speakers. As we know by now, the amalgam is unsteady and eventually settles to one side. And as we know even better, it, like other forms of the abstract/familiar opposition, will go to the side of the abstract, the sounds created by the new machines of the WDR studio. Invested in those machines and sonorities, <i>Gesang</i> has them take possession of the new voice. They even claim the real-life Protschka, who adhered to those sounds, attempting to replicate their precision. Once his voice enters the electronic sound world, it behaves in ways a child's voice could never do&#x02014;singing in layers, even singing backwards. Only electronic timbres, ones voiced by a machine, can do those things. 
</p>

<p>
There is still a child in that voice. He is not completely silenced by the machine. Nor would we expect him to be. His voice serves several purposes. It enriches the abstract machine song with touches of the familiar. It also evokes the youths in the biblical story. Moreover, to erase the boy's voice would prove difficult. It is a strong and distinct sound, one that can survive the electronic topsy-turvy. Even in pieces, it gives a presence to childhood, similar to stray words giving a presence to speech. Childhood remains, but a childhood swept into the realm of the machine. Like other works conjuring the chimerical mechanical child, <i>Gesang</i> pushes the re to one side. The effort is undoubtedly part of the larger movement toward the abstract but it may also stem from a cultural unease with the child machine. Even with such momentum, <i>Gesang</i>, like <i>Astro Boy</i>, does not free itself completely from the disturbing hybrid, giving us a voice that is much more machine than boy, but still both. 
</p>

<p>
The blend is rather intricate, as not only does the boy move to the side of the machine but the machine also acts like a boy. Just as <i>Gesang</i> has electronic sound take on elements of speech, it has the machine assume aspects of childhood. The technology 

<b></b>

in the studio goes beyond the Vocoder and Voder by not just reproducing human speech but by creating sounds that speak in their own way. With those sounds, the machine could be viewed as learning how to speak. In other words, it becomes a child, acquiring language by moving from a few words, the low impulse tones, to a full vocabulary, the sonic spectrum of the F section. Such role-playing may not be the first thing to come to mind upon hearing <i>Gesang</i>, but other critics have commented on childlike aspects of the work. Electronic music was surely in a youthful period of beginnings, but, according to Wilfrid Mellers, <i>Gesang</i> went beyond mere technological origins. As he claims, it was "no accident" that the first piece to establish the idiom, to make "imaginative sense" out of it, deals with themes of "childhood and youth."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Here, electronic music takes its first artistic steps, and speaks its first words. 
</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
Adorno also viewed <i>Gesang</i> as a youthful composition. It possessed vitality at a time when so much new music had "aged" ("ANM," 192). The preoccupation with serialism brought about this decrepitude. New works succumbed to conformity and rigidity. Turned inward, they could no longer speak of or toward the surrounding world. Whereas modernist pieces from earlier in the century conveyed the "threateningly eruptive, the ungrasped," recent compositions could not, nor did they seek to, reveal the disturbing truths assiduously repressed by society ("ANM," 184). It is with relief and apparent glee then that Adorno relates how <i>Gesang</i> so rattled one listener that the agitated man wrote to the radio station about visions of atom bombs and destruction conjured by the work. Stockhausen's piece had ripped agape the screen of pleasantness covering society, to expose the threatening horrors lying underneath.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Adorno also praised <i>Gesang</i> for avoiding the stultifying sameness resulting from the overreaching application of serial schemes. Such designs "leveled" off the rich contours of musical materials, reducing them to the same thin ground. <i>Gesang</i>, however, "contains characters that contrast more strongly than had previously been the taste of the postwar generation."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Strangely, Adorno never identifies these "characters." He never once mentions the child's voice or the religious text, if these indeed are what he means by the term. His omission is curious, for those materials are so striking and unusual for electronic music of the time that one would expect Adorno to say something about their inclusion. The hostile critics and listeners certainly did. Nor does he discuss the relationship between the child's song and electronic sounds, except to comment that all the characters are "technically connected." The remark catches him out of voice, as it repeats serial composers' pat phrases of interrelationships and connections, empty chatter elsewhere excoriated by Adorno.
</p>

<p>
Almost a half-century later, we can see <i>Gesang</i> and its "technical connections" in a very different light. The work is not just one of the most intriguing pieces of 1950s European serialism and early electronic music, it can also be viewed as participating in a larger modernist effort to join the categories of the abstract and the familiar. The 

<b></b>

effort intensified in the 1940s to 1950s as some artists, such as Stockhausen and Pollock, sought to introduce recognizable elements into the densely abstract idioms that they had been cultivating. As mentioned above, there were not set ways of going about such a union. Each work had to find its own solution. <i>Gesang</i> recasts familiar elements in ways emulating the ideals of the abstract, the world of electronic sound. What is especially interesting about the work is how the opposition between the familiar and the abstract assumes various forms. Each of these offshoots&#x02014;purity/impurity, speech/sound, childhood/machine&#x02014;conres the opposition in unique guises, some of which (speech/sound, childhood/machine) reinforce the abstract more than others (purity/impurity).
</p>

<p>
Finally, <i>Gesang</i> offers a different view of the type of modernism cultivated at Darmstadt. The piece holds true to the avant-garde audacity associated with the festival. It brandishes new technologies and musical visions, both of which proved disorienting and upsetting to contemporary listeners. Confidence gives way to vainglory. <i>Gesang</i> gilds the pure with the pure and knots the complexity of electronic sound with the intricacy of speech. Yet at the same time, the work reveals a more vulnerable side to this bold modernism. The vulnerability emerges in the need for the familiar, a need arising from an admission of the limits and dangers of dense abstraction. The reaching out to the familiar places the modern on new and parlous ground as it seeks to connect the seemingly unconnectable. In facing these uncertainties, another side of <i>Gesang</i>&#x02014;appropriately, a youthful side&#x02014;comes across. Like a child, the work takes first steps, struggles, learns, and seeks. </p>

The turn to highly abstract styles (serial and electronic music), of course, responds to an array of cultural influences. They include a continuing modernist reaction against Romantic expression, a reaction against neoclassical styles (themselves an earlier response to Romantic expression), the interest in musical styles which could not be so easily manipulated for political purposes (as the Nazis had done with more traditional tonal idioms), and a growing emulation of scientific ideals of system

The annual new music event held in Darmstadt was one of the centers of modernist activity in the 1950s (and beyond). The festival was inaugurated in 1946 as part of an effort to rebuild German musical life and restore its place in the international scene.

In my research on <i>Gesang</i> and other late modernist pieces, I have observed a tendency for many compositions to focus on a particular state or condition, such as purity, utopia, silence, or the fragmentary. As with the case of purity in <i>Gesang</i>, composers sometimes evoke these singular states through different, and often contradictory, manifestations of that state. For a discussion of the interaction of competing notions of utopia in Stockhausen's <i>Hymnen</i>, see my <i>Quotation and Cultural Meaning in the Twentieth Century</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 139-55.

To recall, Stockhausen had originally planned but never completed a final G section. The Facsimile Edition of the work provides sketch materials for that section. Although it is difficult to ascertain what exactly this section would sound like and what form the relationship between electronic sound and human voice would have taken, it appears that the final section would have built upon the fluid sound world created in the F section. Most of the final events of the work are for electronic sounds; however, the ending includes several prominent choral swarms and chords.

<p class="noIndent">
Indulge me in this undernarrated episode in the long history of modernist caprice. During the summer of 1943, Marsden Hartley made a visit to Madison Square Garden to catch "Spangles," a one-ring circus mounted by the Ringling Brothers. In early August, he wrote to his young friend Richard Sisson, an Army sergeant stationed in New York, asking him if he had seen this "darling show" with a white horse that looked like "a page out of Wm. Blake's prophetic books."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Hartley, who would die just a month later, also explained that he was putting the finishing touches on his circus book, titled first <i>Circus</i> and later, more showily, <i>Elephants and Rhinestones: A Book of Circus Values</i>. In this unfinished project, the aging Hartley would fulfill a longstanding desire to develop "the idea of acrobatics," and to "make [himself] historian for these . . . esthetes of muscular melody," for whom "life is but one long day in which to make beautiful their bodies, and make joyful the eyes of those who love to look at them!"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  And so, sixty-six years old, with sore joints and an ailing heart, Hartley returns to the place under the big top where his eyes can best get their fill: "I make the awful ascent by the stairways, alas no elevators in the circus, and when I have achieved this exhausting feat, I am thoroughly at home."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  This, the habitu&#x000E9;'s accustomed seat ("section twenty five or six"), is the very apex of pleasure: "I always have wanted to be opposite the flying trapeze," he claims, because "this is the act of all acts that I care for most . . . it is these artists who have always given me the most" (<i>C2</i>, 2; <i>C1,</i> 1). 
</p>

<p>
The precise nature of the acrobat's gift is elusive but of crucial import for our understanding of modernism's broad repertoire of feeling in the public sphere, as well as of the political 

<b></b>

asymmetries informing such affective modes. In exploring the nexus of affect and publicity in Hartley's work, I join the critical effort better to understand&#x02014;but not simply to recuperate&#x02014;the place of sentiment in modernism and the politico-ethical positions such feeling might entail. Hartley's work not only troubles still-current gendered truisms about "(masculine) modernism's programmatic antisentimentalism, its ironic detachment from love,"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  but urges us to consider the exoteric structuring of modernist affects within and across a dynamic and reflexive public sphere: here, for example, through the spectacular performances that so fascinated modernists.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Indeed, Hartley's misty-eyed attachment to acrobats is not <i>just</i> feeling but theory, a matter of desire and its negotiation, an attempt to think a form of public intimacy ("the idea of acrobatics") premised, I will argue, not on a plummy fantasy of unmediated connection, nor a Habermasian "audience-oriented" intimacy that would train the subject to participate in rational-critical and market exchanges, but rather on a kind of subjective detachment produced by spectacle.
</p>

<p>
In his sustained connoisseurship of the private dimension of popular performance, of course, Hartley was not alone, but the stakes of his articulation of public intimacy, like the closely related terms of its conception&#x02014;embodiment, vision, exteriorized detachment&#x02014;were clearly overdetermined by his homosexuality and its own fraught ration within contemporary aesthetic and sexological discourse.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In this sense, Hartley's attempt to think intimacy through itinerant public spectacles like the circus also resonates within the discourse of queer publicness, of homosexual intimacies in the public sphere.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  At the risk of drawing too easy or anachronistic an analogy between Hartley's modernist thing for acrobats and contemporary queer politics, we might say that Hartley's acrobatic investments were attempts to imagine and legitimate, but not overly publicize, a fugitive mode of idealized relation. If not true intersubjectivity, this proximate grammar&#x02014;constructed of res both corporeal and linguistic&#x02014;flickers between intimacy and publicity, social attachment and detachment, emotive personalism and spectacular disembodiment, surfacing both in Hartley's painting and in his writing in the form of what I call, after Hartley, the acrobat's "light re." In what follows, I trace the graceful utility of these res and their attendant grammar: as their conditions of possibility emerge in the "age of blood and iron" of Wilhelmine Berlin, as they mediate Hartley's tenuous relationship to New York dada and the Stieglitz circle in the 1920s, and as they make their final, most eloquent performance in <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>.

<p class="noIndent">
As Hartley saw it, the intimacy achieved by the truly light re entailed a perceptual attunement to a larger plurality, the "hobnobbing with the universe" to which he was privy both on the streets of bohemian Paris and in that&#x02014;for him&#x02014;<i>flagrant</i> interior of Gertrude Stein's salon: "[Y]ou had much, in all human ways, out of an evening there . . . you had the quality of yourself and others, a kind of William James intimacy, which, as everyone knows, is style bringing the universe of ideas to your door in terms 

<b></b>

of your own sensations" (<i>AIA,</i> 195).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Like James, Hartley insisted on the complex beauty of a world of difference composed of "innumerable unforetold particulars," but accessed ultimately through individual perceptual experience, the "stuff of which everything is made."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Hartley put it thus in his essay "Concerning Fairy Tales and Me":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am related to the world by the way I feel attached to the life of it as exemplified in the vividness of the moment.

<p class="noIndent">
"Experience as delectable diversion." This logic seems simple enough: the more vivid the moment, the more bound to life one becomes; the more entrancing the spectacle, the stronger the attachment between the spectator and the heterogeneous splendor of outside life. And yet this moment of attunement is also red as a separation of sorts, a discarding of the "material husk" of experience in the moment of "delectable diversion." As Hartley explains this tension in an essay on the "new kind of poetic diversion" in the work of Emily Dickinson, a kind of "sublime, impertinent playfulness" is achieved through a "celestial attachedness, or must we call it detachedness" (<i>AIA,</i> 200). Here, Hartley offers us a decidedly modernist category, "experience," that remains strangely unrecognizable. This kind of feeling outward, we might say, is Jamesian insofar as its vehicle is the perceiving individual, but decidedly un-Jamesian in its centrifugal movement away from the "private and the personal" and toward the "cosmic and the general," in its seeming departure from the true self whose geometric locus James once identified at "the innermost center of the circle."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  For Hartley, as for Walter Benjamin and the Frankfurt School tradition more broadly, "experience" is a conceptual "hinge between consciousness and world, inside and outside, monadic subject and community," but there is no mourning here of the eclipse of genuine <i>Erfahrung</i> by enervated <i>Erlebnis</i>.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Nor is "diversion" a compensatory perceptual mode, as "distraction" is in Benjamin's and Siegfried Kracauer's formulations.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Conceptually speaking, diversion is delicious, rich with tasty antinomies Hartley toys with but refuses to resolve: the senses exist in a state of heightened receptivity and diversion simultaneously, and experience radiates away from the individual, yet remains rooted in private delectation. 
</p>

<p>
These erotic dynamics materialized early in Hartley's career in the streets of Wilhelmine Berlin, where the painter moved from Paris after befriending the German sculptor Arnold R&#x000F6;nnebeck. As Hartley explained in his autobiography, the spectacle of the Kaiser's parade renewed his "love for any kind of pageantry, all coming from early boyhood and . . . the coming of the circus to Lewiston"; in the "voluptuous tension" of prewar Berlin, Hartley "at last could have all [he] wanted of crowd parade pageantry public glamour and the like" (<i>SP,</i> 87, 86, 90). Located within this unpunctuated chain of res for publicness that joins cherished moments from 

<b></b>

Hartley's boyhood to the urban present of martial modernity, the Kaiser's parade and the "real Barnum circus" code and cross-reference each other. What Hartley conjures, as a result, is less a glib militarism that conflates war and play than a potent and portable fantasy of spectatorial release, of the joyous and intimate dynamic of "feeling outward" mobilized, in this instance, by the martial scene: "I could always know that I was quite like other people when I was with a lot of people. [The crowd] would take me out and make me feel outward and that has always been necessary&#x02014;for it is a very bad thing to live inside so much&#x02014;as no one has learned better than myself" (<i>SP,</i> 90). In this, Hartley's riff on the "man of the crowd," Charles Baudelaire's dandy fails to confirm his heroic individualism; Georg Simmel's "blas&#x000E9;" metropolitan man finds himself suddenly, erotically resensitized.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Most importantly, the sensual publicity occasioned by the Kaiser's parade satisfies the expatriate's need "to feel outward" in a way that manages to be both common (it reminds him that he "was quite like most other people") and intimate (it makes him "feel at home") at once.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Thus, this scene is remarkable not because it reworks a familiar trope of modern sociality, or, more locally, a common swerve in Hartley's career from inwardness to exteriority and publicity, but rather because it marks an instance in which these distinctions collapse: a moment of intimate pleasure that Hartley would repeatedly seek in public spaces&#x02014;in music halls, at the Kaiser's parade, or near the trapeze.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Hartley realized early on that this dynamic of "feeling outward" mobilized by public spectacle required a specific kind of body. In Berlin, the movement from the private to the cosmic was occasioned by the nation's thoroughly aestheticized military-political regime, embodied in the "Kaiser's special guard&#x02014;all in white," and memorialized in Hartley's <i>The Warriors</i> (1913; <a href="#1"> 1</a>; <i>SP,</i> 90). Hartley was overcome by the "flair and perfection" of the guard and, by extension, of the thoroughly martial German nation, whose "spick and spanness" and "cleanliness" in "the order of life [Hartley] had never witnessed anywhere" (<i>SP,</i> 86). An homage to this order, <i>The Warriors</i> mirrors it with a perfectly balanced composition and, at the painting's edges, a symmetrical dispersal of the soldiers within an abstracted field. The celestial, ethereal placement of these bodies as they march toward the setting sun (and thus, as Hartley explains, toward their deaths) makes clear that these are bodies en route to becoming <i>Geist,</i> political myth: "A real ecstasy for war is the only modern religious ecstasy&#x02014;The only means of displaying the old time martyrdom&#x02014;one shall not forget their handsome smiling faces going by&#x02014;waving hands, throwing kisses and shouting auf Wiedersehen."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Seemingly celestial, these handsome bodies are not yet truly light res; more pedantic than playful, they offer a hard lesson in the costs of a spectacular attachment, and one that energizes Hartley's formulation of public intimacy. Critics tend to agree that <i>The Warriors</i> marks Hartley's "first significant rative effort" in an early career marked by a reluctance to treat the human form;<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  further, this ration carried an especially intense private charge for Hartley, who had fallen for Germany's militarism, its liberated <i>Leibeskultur,</i><sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  and its relatively tolerant atmosphere toward homosexuality as he fell for a specific soldier, Lieutenant von Freyburg (R&#x000F6;nnebeck's cousin), who 

<b></b>

would die in the Great War in 1914. Given these personal attachments and the powerful associations between the German military and homosexuality in the early decades of the twentieth century, <i>The Warriors</i> works as a thoroughly spectacular index of private feeling.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Further, this exteriorization of intimacy&#x02014;anchored in the mystico-spiritualist theories then fueling German artistic culture&#x02014;implies an untroubled correspondence between formal exterior and subjective interior, a "heavy re" that resurfaces, in intensely gendered terms, in the aesthetic theories of Stieglitz-circle critics.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

If Hartley increasingly turns&#x02014;as I argue below&#x02014;to the light res that confound such easy trafficking between surface and depth, the War Motif series&#x02014;begun in 1914, as a memorial to von Freyburg&#x02014;lays the conceptual groundwork for these res' emergence. These paintings, including <i>Portrait of a German Officer</i> (1914; <a href="#2"> 2</a>) and <i>Painting No. 47</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>), mark a salient departure from the <i>The Warriors</i>'s unchecked 

<b></b>

rhapsody of an ecstatic collectivity that depends upon public bodies poised in martial orchestration and political sublimation. Though Hartley would publicly disavow any personal symbolism in these paintings, his friend R&#x000F6;nnebeck decoded some of the imagery: von Freyburg's initials, his age at death (twenty-four), the Iron Cross he received for his acts in battle. These symbols are superimposed on the trappings of the German military such that the flat collages scan anthropomorphically, recalling the lost totality of von Freyburg's body through a quasi-cubist fragmentation (<i>SV,</i> 152). The disrement and death that Hartley could romanticize, prior to von Freyburg's own, as a kind of martyrdom are, these paintings suggest, the cost of the spectacular body dangerously attached to a larger totality. For here, von Freyburg's body is literally all spectacle, dispersed into a field of military signs in a manner bespeaking not spiritual triumph but the painful absence of a body. But for Hartley, the recalcitrant exteriority of the painting is quite useful. Two of Hartley's more astute critics, noting this strategic disembodiment, have emphasized the "elaborate veiling, layering, and masking of identity" undertaken in these images, and suggested how Hartley "keep[s] desire at bay" here by withholding the physical body of his lover, how he diffuses homosexual desire "through the multiple masks of literary obfuscation, abstract style, encoding, and death." (<i>PGCT,</i> 179; <i>SV,</i> 161!=, 162). The implications of this technique can be drawn even more sharply: these paintings demonstrate Hartley's investment in surpassing the dichotomies of private and public, interiority and exteriority. As such, Hartley's lesson in the excesses of ecstatic intimacy in the War Motif series becomes a nascent theory of public intimacy: at once <i>all</i> sign and hushed, the paintings suggest how Hartley's attachment to corporeal glamour&#x02014;of the Prussian guard, of Barnum and Bailey&#x02014;was premised on detachment: on spectacle's ability to absent the self rather than present it.

II. "Vivacious Hobbyhorse"
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1921, in the crossfire of the American avant-garde's reigning aesthetic and corporeal paradigms&#x02014;the Stieglitz Circle and dada's New York avatar&#x02014;Hartley published his first book of criticism, <i>Adventures in the Arts: Informal Chapters on Painters, Vaudeville, and Poets</i>. Over and against New York dada's cerebral and detached treatment of the commodified, mass-produced body, Alfred Stieglitz promulgated what Marcia Brennan has recently dubbed "embodied formalism," a "general discursive tendency" swirling around those artists (Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, John Marin, and more peripherally, Charles Demuth and Hartley) whom Stieglitz promoted as part of his call for an organic American art, freed from Puritan repression and continental effeteness (<i>PGCT,</i> 8).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This tendency, Brennan argues, was rooted in a model of "aestheticized, integrated selfhood" in which abstract and symbolic forms were understood by painters and their critics alike as transparent, sublimated "analogues of the artists' own gendered presences," and "no divisions obtained between the subject's body, their spirit, and the world around them" (<i>PGCT,</i> 43, 3, 43).
</p>

<p>
Hartley's <i>Adventures</i> is literally framed by these discourses: it begins with an introduction by Waldo Frank, Stieglitz's friend and champion, ends with Hartley's essay, "The Importance of Being 'Dada,'" and is filled in between with a range of essays on painting, poetry, film, and performance, all penned in Hartley's quirky style&#x02014;witty, epigrammatic, and relentlessly Emersonian in its elliptical manner. Frank's opening salvo presents the author as itinerant, various, and profoundly intimate; his essays are "chronicles not so much [of] these actual worlds as his own pleasure of them. They are but mirrors, many-shaped and lighted, for his own delicate, incisive humor."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Yet they are also, by virtue of their critical publicity, a form of embodiment: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

When the creator turns critic, we are in the presence of a consummation: we have a complete experience: we have a sort of sacrament. For to the intrusion of the world he interposes his own body. In his art, the creator's body would be itself intrusion. The artist is too humble and too sane to break the ecstatic flow of vision with his personal form. The true artist despises the personal as an end. He makes fluid, and distills his personal form. He channels it beyond himself to a Unity which of course contains it. But Criticism is nothing which is not the sheer projection of the body. The artist turns Self into a universal Form: but the critic reduces Form to Self. Criticism is to the artist the intrusion, in a form irreducible to art, of the body of the world. What can he do but interpose his own?<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Notice here how Frank res the act of criticism&#x02014;the sheer projection of the body into the world&#x02014;as a secularized transubstantiation, one that reverses the centrifugal movement of aesthetic production from private to cosmic, forcing Hartley-as-critic back into a personalism and, by extension, a body whose publicity Hartley found increasingly dangerous in the wake of the war's carnage. While this frame is in keeping with Frank's relentless stumping throughout the 1920s for a corporeal nativism in American art, it sits awkwardly around the variegated essays of <i>Adventures,</i> which bounce nervously between the competing charms of corporeality and intellection, personalism and detachment, intimacy and publicity.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As exercises in taste, then, these 

<b></b>

critical essays entail not just, as Frank explains, the "sheer projection of a body," but also, as Joseph Litvak puts it in a slightly different register, the queer projection of an excessive desire&#x02014;a sophistication that seems suspiciously "<i>impure,</i> contaminated from the outset by a desiring, and thus disgusting, body" within a culture wherein gay men "have traditionally functioned as objects of such distinguished epistemological and rhetorical aggressions as urbanity and knowingness."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  As an adventure in queer sophistication, Hartley's critical delectation stands not&#x02014;as Frank would have it&#x02014;in opposition to the "actual" world, but as its very contested terrain; here, Hartley's indulgence in circus matters, like the mode of intimacy these spectacles occasion, is as excessive as it is expertly controlled. 
</p>

<p>
The terms of these dialectics are established in "Whitman and C&#x000E9;zanne," for Hartley, the "two most notable innovators" in poetry and painting, alike in "esthetic intention" but divided by their "concepts of, and their attitudes toward life": "For the one, life was a something to stay close to always, for the other, it was something to be afraid of almost to an abnormal degree; Whitman and his door never closed, C&#x000E9;zanne and his door seldom or never opened, indeed, were heavily padlocked against the intrusion of the imaginary outsider" (<i>AIA,</i> 30, 32). Hartley nevertheless notes that Whitman's open-door policy fueled a corporeal extensiveness that was
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
at one and the same time his virtue and his defect. For mystical reasons, it was imperative for him to include all things in himself. . . . That he could leave nothing out was, it may be said, his strongest esthetical defect, for it is by esthetical judgment that we choose and bring together those elements as we conceive it. . . . So that it is the tendency in Whitman to catalogue in detail the entire obvious universe that makes many of his pages a strain on the mind as well as on the senses, and the eye especially.

<p class="noIndent">
With this critique of Whitmanesque publicity comes an important revision of the terms of spectacle: in imperial Berlin, Hartley's eye is insatiable, overcome by stimuli from the outside, ecstatic with the pleasure of an exteriorized self made intimate with the universe: "The coming face to face with so much life and art all at once&#x02014;was all but blinding&#x02014;but I have blue eyes and blue eyes can take in all things and not be disturbed by them&#x02014;except to be extatically [<i>sic</i>] disturbed&#x02014;which is their way of being passionate" (<i>SP,</i> 90). Now, he seems suspicious of the moment of self-absenting that&#x02014;in the Emersonian and Whitmanesque model&#x02014;enlarges the appetite of a gluttonous "I." These "primitives" have "voiced most of all the imperative need of essential personalism, of direct expression out of direct experience, with an eye to nothing but quality and proportion" (<i>AIA,</i> 36). Whitman's limitation, then, is not his personalism, but the centrifugal movement of his senses. The excesses of the mystical eye, we might say, must be chastened by the kind of discrimination and taste found in C&#x000E9;zanne: "It is the mark of good taste to reject that which is unessential, and the 'tact of omission,' well exemplified in C&#x000E9;zanne, has been found excellently axiomatic" (<i>AIA,</i> 34). 
</p>

<p>
For the training of the newly tractable eye, and for an example of the controlled relations such sight, and such spectacles, occasion, Hartley turns to the popular performances of vaudeville and the circus in three thematically related essays: "The Twilight 

<b></b>

of the Acrobat," "Vaudeville," and "A Charming Equestrienne," all written between 1917 and 1920. Musing wistfully on the acrobat's "aesthetic" death as "Twilight" opens, Hartley pouts that in contemporary variety "everything seems tuxedoed for drawing room purposes," and blames this loathsome state on "the so-called politeness . . . of the elimination of our once revered acrobats. The circus notion has been replaced by the parlor entertainment notion" (<i>AIA,</i> 156,158).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The "variety that was once a joy is now a bore," and the "habitual patron can no longer endure the offerings of the present time with a degree of pleasure, much less with ease" (<i>AIA,</i> 160). So Hartley promptly calls for "the re-creation of variety into something more conducive to light pleasure for the eye," heralding the "return of the acrobat in a more modern dress" (<i>AIA,</i> 160). What Hartley has in mind

<p>
Wishing aloud, in vain, for a "Beardsley of the stage," a messianic set designer who might best frame his scopic pleasure, Hartley will go it alone, indulging in hypothetical fancy: the acrobats "need first of all large plain spaces upon which to perform, and enjoy their own remarkably devised patterns of body" (<i>AIA,</i> 163, 162-3).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This enjoyment is both the performer's narcissistic self-enjoyment as spectacle (the equestrienne "exquisitely in harmony with herself") and, paradoxically, a spectatorial pleasure premised on "intimacy with the beauty" of the performer, which Hartley would intensify, in his example, by relocating the Brothers Rath acrobats to the coveted center of the bill (<i>AIA,</i> 163). And it is this scene's paradoxical nature&#x02014;the way the performers' theatricalized isolation heightens spectatorial intimacy&#x02014;that pleases Hartley. The intimacy it imagines between the acrobat's body and the spectator's eye is mediated by beauty, made tractable by framing, orchestration, and discernment. In this way, when Hartley's fantasies of orchestration seem most excessive they are, in fact, the most controlled, the most tasteful, and thus, the most delightful.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Indeed, while Hartley decries the enervating ornamentation of higher vaudeville, his own set design nevertheless goes for baroque:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I want a Metropolitan Opera for my project. An orchestra of that size for the larger concerted groups, numbers of stringed instruments for the wirewalkers and jugglers, a series of balanced woodwinds for others, and so on down the line, according to the quality of the performer. There should be a large stage for many elephants, ponies, dogs, tigers, seals. The stage should then be made more intimate for the solos, duets, trios, and quartets among the acrobats. I think a larger public should be made more aware of the beauty and skill of these people, who spend their lives in perfecting grace and power of body, creating the always fascinating pattern and form, orchestration if you will, the orchestration of the muscles into a complete whole.

Another fantasy of drilled res, this dream recalls the Kaiser's parade, the drama of sublimated bodies whose exposure, in von Freyburg's case, promises politico-spiritual totality but ends in death and loss. Hartley himself draws the mnemonic links between this playful project of corporeal orchestration and a historical moment of prewar erotic plenitude in "A Charming Equestrienne," when he dates his "happiest memories" of circus expression, of the "artists of bodily vigor, of muscular melody" to "the streets of Paris before the war, the incomparably lovely f&#x000EA;tes. Only the sun knows where these dear artists may be now" (<i>AIA,</i> 176, 175, 176). (In fact, the language here anticipates his later description of <i>The Warriors</i> in his autobiography who, remember, "went out into the sun and didn't come back.")<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Thus, Hartley's circus fantasy is both nostalgic, harking back to a prelapsarian, prewar intimacy, and strategic, remembering erotic fullness within the controlled domain of "light pleasure for the eye" (<i>AIA,</i> 160). 
</p>

<p>
More than just the fruit of Hartley's erotic investment in the acrobat's body, intimacy (again, of a decidedly tractable sort) provides the foundation of what he calls the "idea of acrobatics": the functionality of the acrobat both as a body viewed and as a mode of embodiment, a visible object of "light pleasure" and a re of proximate relation. Consider, for example, Hartley's rendering in the "Vaudeville" essay of an especially striking "acrobatic novelty" in "The Legroh's" act: "This 'Legroh' knows how to make a superb pattern with his body, and the things he does with it are done with such ease and skill as to make you forget the actual physical effort and you are lost for the time being in the beauty of this muscular kaleidoscopic brilliancy. You feel it is like a 'puzzle&#x02014;find the man,' for a time" (<i>AIA,</i> 171-2). Offering the performative version of the same "puzzle" of the War Motif series, the acrobat's skill is his ability to trace a pattern so spectacular that it absents the performer, whose humanity (find the man!) transforms into "lovely flower and animal forms," or even more abstractly, into "ever changing ever shifting bits of colour" and pattern (<i>AIA,</i> 172). This loss is doubled in the spectator, whose purely visual pleasure unburdens him of thought as "the tumbling blocks of the brain . . . fall into heaps": "You have no chance for the fatigue of problem [<i>sic</i>]. You are at rest as far as thinking is concerned. It is something for the eye first and last" (<i>AIA,</i> 172-3). The "idea of acrobatics," for Hartley, is oxymoronic, since this art jettisons ideation in both practitioner and spectator: "it is the art where the human mind is for once relieved of its stupidity. The acrobat is master of his body and he lets his brain go a-roving upon other matters, if he has one" (<i>AIA,</i> 173). Issuing from the acrobat's mindlessness (a state surely anathema to Duchamp and Picabia) is a silence that is itself useful for Hartley, suggestive of a Jamesian sociality: "He is expected to be silent. He would agree with William James, transposing 'music prevents thinking' into 'talking prevents silence.' In so many instances, it prevents conversation. That is why I like tea chit-chat. Words are never meant to mean anything then. They are simply given legs and wings, and they jump and fly. They land where they can, and fall flat if they must" (<i>AIA,</i> 173). The logic is seemingly paradoxical&#x02014;talking prevents silence <i>and</i> conversation&#x02014;until we realize that Hartley is after a kind of talking situated precisely on the seam of sociality. The privileged quiescence of the acrobat hinges on a special, physical language that in becoming publicly embodied (like 

<b></b>

the words that, in tea-talk, sprout appendages) is evacuated of heavy significance and deep interiority. Unlike the more familiar mode of modernist impersonality as, for example, T. S. Eliot defines it&#x02014;wherein the poet detaches from the enervating immediacy of modern personation by finally embedding his language in the marrow of cultural tradition&#x02014;Hartley depersonalizes in order to preserve less entangling interpersonal connections, to facilitate more mobile, more tractable attachments.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Hostile, like Eliot, to romantic notions of interiority, Harley idealizes a language whose lightness enables an intersubjective condition at once flighty and controlled.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Not saddled with ponderous meaning, this tacit speech allows the agile ego to absent itself by becoming entirely spectacular, relieved of semantic weightiness and, by extension, of the burden of corporeal transparency. 
</p>

<p>
Given the logic of sexual transparency espoused by the Stieglitz circle, the terms of Paul Rosenfeld's review of <i>Adventures</i> fail to surprise.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Picking up on the book's campy ostentation, Rosenfeld notes how "Hartley has striven to make his writing a superior sort of talk, part of a seriously developed aesthetic of a spirit exquisitely civilized and urbane."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But he dismisses the "more simple, more slight, more fluffily iridescent" prose of <i>Adventures</i> as an attempt
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

to transcend the arid empty space about him by playing with bits of bright silk, curious toys, heavy and fantastic flower-cups. Grace and charm and peacock-like magnificence hide and yet betray utter fatigue with never having really lived. Author and audience are in tacit conspiracy to fix their minds on some jolly and curious fragment of physical, unthinking life on "minstrels of muscular musical melody," on girls who play ivory and silver diamond-studded accordions, on the "brilliant excitation of the moment," that the immanence of death and corruption be forgotten.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
For Rosenfeld, Hartley's dandified idiom is all small talk: it fixates on the unthinking corporeality of its subjects with a compensatory intensity that would transcend an underlying experiential sterility (the price, no doubt, of a bad object choice) or, in still more cowardly fashion, ignore the heavy reality of the exterior, the "immanence of death and corruption." In this reading, then, Hartley's language hoists itself on its own petard: when it trains its attention on the physical, it is too light, its subject's seeming corporeality a mere pretext for unthinking detumescence.
</p>

<p>
Dismissing the book's talkiness as the flaw of a gabby queer whose language and pigment are alike unmanned by a "vagabond <i>libido,</i>" Rosenfeld's review misses the subtleties of Hartley's argument about language, especially as this communication is red through the acrobat, who may be dumb, but is never stupid.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  As Hartley later frames it in "The Greatest Show on Earth," he "puts his mind into his muscles and into his eyes and he leaves purely cerebral concepts and words to their own natural futility."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Intellect and language have not been abandoned, as Rosenfeld would assert, but are no longer <i>purely</i> cerebral&#x02014;rather, they are embodied in a fashion that produces their "exquisite speechlessness" ("GSE," 88).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  As "bodies made intelligent as well as perfect," Hartley's acrobats model a synthesis of body and mind as well as the kind of spectatorship predicated on this synthesis:

<p class="noIndent">
These eyes are the acrobat's and, potentially, those of his spectators. And this passage is riddled with a series of paradoxes that surge from Hartley's attempt to articulate the sort of intimacy this re enacts with his viewer. On the one hand, the circus spectacle produces a simple distraction; its sensory intensity provides a diversion from "inward dramas" and "the sense of life's disillusionments." In this sense, &#x000E0; la Rosenfeld, the acrobat is simply a re of detachment, and an occasion of the same in his viewer. But Hartley's fantasy is more ambitious: the acrobat's eyes are charged not just with "satisfying aesthetic needs" but also with the work of the material world. They are linked to the mind but their semantic yield resists "interpretation and confused commentary." They are attached to their object (they "possess synthetically what they encounter") and subject (they "make emotional history out of casual opportunity"). As such, they come to embody a Dickinsonian attached detachment, the conceptual cynosure of "experience as diversion." 
</p>

<p>
This experience, not surprisingly, is irresistible for Hartley, who concludes his essay with yet another circus fantasy, and one that he can enjoy not just as spectator but as participant: "If there really is to be a Heaven hereafter, then let me go straight by pelican air service to that division of it set apart for the circus and go pellmell for the rings and the bars, till I can join the splendid horde all turning and springing and flying through the properly-roped spaces and merge myself in the fine pattern which these superior artists make in what will no longer be 'The Greatest Show on Earth'" ("GSE," 88). In this passage, with its characteristic mix of abandon and orchestrated restraint (the space of ecstasy must always be "properly-roped"), Hartley enacts his version of dada as he formulates it in "The Importance of Being Dada," <i>Adventures</i>'s final essay: <i>"</i>I ride my own hobby-horse away from the dangers of art which is with us a modern vice at present, into the wide expanse of magnanimous diversion from which I may extract all the joyousness I am capable of from the patterns I encounter" (<i>AIA,</i> 251). This essay is not, as Brennan argues, a statement of "affiliation with the New York Dada movement" that inaugurates Hartley's growing disavowal of the personal.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Nor is it, as Rosenfeld would have it, a rhapsody of the "brilliant excitation of the moment" that trades fancy for life itself. Rather, Hartley's understanding of dada as a kind of capricious individualism is neither Duchampian nor Picabian but itself highly capricious, a jejune misreading of the movement.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Hartley is "a dada-ist because it is the nearest" he has come to "a scientific principle in existence," a principle of fanciful enjoyment that is nevertheless outward-bound: "I have a hobby-horse therefore&#x02014;to ride away out into the world of intricate common experience; out into the arena with those who know what the element of life itself is, and that I have become an expression 

<b></b>

of the one issue in the mind worth the consideration of the artist, namely fluidic change" (<i>AIA,</i> 251). 
</p>

<p>
This joyride remains controlled insofar as the experience finds Hartley tastefully merged within a fine pattern.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Rocking through flux with an engineer's precision, Hartley's hobbyhorse nevertheless refuses to settle, or to settle down. Rather than substituting the sterile, opaque, or otherwise detached dada corporeality for a vital, transparent one in the mold of the Stieglitz circle, Hartley's acrobat&#x02014;flitting on the seam of public and private&#x02014;allows him to think both at once. Neither, alone, would satisfy; the former forsaking the virility and vitality of the plastic body for the mind, the latter predicated on weighty and troublesome semantic equations between art and essence, text and sex, publicity and intimacy. Attached to the "intricate world of common experience," the light re mediates the self and "that to which I am not related" with a rhetoric of corporeal intimacy that, by virtue of its lightness, achieves a celestial detachment:

You will find, therefore, that if you are aware of yourself, you will be your own perfect dada-ist, in that you are for the first time riding your own hobby-horse into infinity of sensation through experience, and that you are one more satisfactory vaudevillian among the multitudes of dancing legs and flying wits. You will learn that after all that the bugaboo called LIFE is a matter of the tightrope and that the stars will shine their frisky approval as you glide, if you glide sensibly, with an eye on the fun in the performance.

Experience as diversion here remains resolutely childish, and this passage is not simply innocent, as Frank would have it, but strategically so. To borrow from Litvak again, Hartley's hobbyhorse res a kind of sophisticated na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;, riding away not from the actual, but from the monotonous actuality of "universal heterosexualization, whereby 'growing up' in fact means shutting down, tuning out, closing off various receptivities that make it possible to find the world <i>interesting</i>."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In <i>Elephants and Rhinestones,</i> Hartley would struggle to disentangle the acrobat's vitality from his heterosexual deathliness.

If it is not the properly "historical account" of the wonders of acrobatic life proposed in <i>Adventures, Elephants and Rhinestones</i> remains Hartley's last and most sustained foray into the vicissitudes of public intimacy and the fate of its enabling res. <i>Elephants</i> is loosely organized through Hartley's ruminations&#x02014;ranging in length from paragraph-long bursts to four-page rhapsodies&#x02014;on individual performers, acts, lore, and trends in the circus, the institution that he has "loved . . . all [his] life, just as one loves one's dog, or pet canary, one's marmoset, or one's cockatoo" (<i>C2,</i> 1).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Fragmented and fawning, <i>Elephants</i> is this circus fan's <i>Passagen-Werk,</i> and generally assumes catalogue form: Hartley lists the individual name of a performer or event ("Barbette," 

<b></b>

"Spangles&#x02014;A Continental Circus," "Grock," etc.) and follows it with his reminiscence, often driven by a wildly associative train that leads him across time and space, and then (usually) back to the subject under consideration, which is always both the ostensible subject and Hartley himself. This freewheeling narrative, while personal, sentimental, and quite melancholy, deploys throughout an inherently intersubjective rhetorical mode.As it was for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, "one of the few great artists of modern times to whom the circus was an intimate language," the circus for Hartley is a matter of "you" and "I," and Hartley's linguistic gambit in <i>Elephants</i> is to talk in an intimate language that approximates the elusive speech of the acrobat, to fashion a proximate grammar of relation from the intimate world of the circus (<i>C1</i>, 57). Not surprisingly, then, Hartley's linguistic res, like the privileged physiques of their corporeal analogue the acrobat, are rarely weighty. Rather, to poach the terms of Hartley's critique of certain acrobatic "egoists" like the Fratellinis and Con Colleano, this "type of work calls for a slight and agile re . . . for light res" (<i>C2,</i> 10). Such lightness, as a mode of gender (not, like Colleano, "too masculine"), as well as a condition both semantic (it is not saddled with ponderous meaning) and, by extension, subjective (it is an ego negated through spectacle), continues and extends the "tea chit-chat" he champions in <i>Adventures</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But in <i>Elephants</i>, Hartley seems torn between keeping his res light and burdening them with significance. Indeed, in the middle of <i>Circus 1,</i> we find, in isolation, three quotations from the British sexologist Henry Havelock Ellis, which appear under the phrase "Elephants and Rhinestones" on what looks like a provisional title page. These epigraphs, which effectively give the lie to Hartley's lightness, appear as follows: 
</p>

Taking the frivolous seriously and imbuing the superficial with interiority, Ellis's epigraphs reverse the work of the light re, making too big a deal of little things. Thus, Hartley would seem to overburden his light res, which now not only carry the referential heft of sexological discourse, but are here uniquely charged with "really reveal[ing] the intimate depths of personality."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Hartley's ambivalence toward his light res is, in fact, the structuring contradiction of <i>Elephants'</i>s rhetoric, whose lightness conjures a vital, intimate community of spectacular performers and "fan-atic" spectators, but is haunted throughout by loss, death, and the annihilation of the acrobatic self. At the center of this world, and of this grammar, is the drama of Alfredo Codona 

<b></b>

and Lillian Leitzel, for Hartley the lightest, most spectacular of aerialists: "I miss with a wide band of deep mourning on my arm those two grand artists of the air . . . both of whom came to such tragic ends, one by a fall while performing in Copenhagen, and the other by his own hand after the tragic denouement described elsewhere" (<i>C2,</i> 3). And as Hartley's language traces its florid designs though this world, his circumlocutions keep circling back to the personal and public "tragedy of the Codona madness," whose "holocaustic finalities" come to embody the drama of public intimacy, the obscenity of the exposed self, and, perhaps, the triumph of flesh-as-idea, a newly material imagination (<i>C2,</i> 7; <i>C1,</i> 8). In <i>Elephants,</i> Codona and Leitzel emerge at once as the ideal avatars of public intimacy and as the corporeal index of this relational mode's acute vulnerability; thus, the trauma of the "Codona madness" and the stakes of its imaginative negotiation in <i>Elephants</i> are only meaningful if we keep in sight the intense theoretical burden these light res bear in Hartley's imagination. 
</p>

<p>
For Hartley, to convey properly the intimate language of the circus in <i>Elephants</i> is to allow his reader to share his fantasy space, to undergo a queer rite of initiation into a kind of intimacy.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  His acrobatic "eye" depends throughout <i>Elephants</i> on proximate, apostrophic address to his reader. And so, while the manuscript abounds with a first-person voice actively engaged in the act of imaginative vision-as-memory, it beckons a reader and enlists a confidence:<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup> 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

the circus is like a multicolored globe&#x02014;into which you look and see the many wonders of the imagination's world like the humongous crystal ball illuminated from under by a revolving prismatic plate in the geological dept. of the museum of natural history. . . . After all, between you and me, life itself is all right&#x02014;isn't it&#x02014;do we not live by what we know[,] the idea of life&#x02014;and not what humans think it is&#x02014;haven't the dynasties and millenniums proven that nothing can change the quality of the thing itself?

"Between you and me": these moments of lyric apostrophe proliferate in "Elephants"as Hartley fashions a communion of vision with his addressee: "If you saw [the juggler Enrico] Rastelli once only, you would watch the dimness gather like a cloud"(<i>C1,</i> 18); "but you will know" ringmaster Fred Bradna "when you see him again" (<i>C2,</i> 6). The second-person pronoun, of course, posits an addressee, another subject whose invocation, as Emile Benveniste teaches us, establishes the "polarity of persons" as the "fundamental condition in language."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  But in Hartley's case, the seemingly commonsensical point that intersubjectivity in language is inevitable and is, in fact, its enabling condition is at once reassuring and profoundly unsettling: reassuring, because it makes him "feel outward," an exteriority whose rhetorical manifestation is apostrophe, a turning-outward; unsettling, because such communication always threatens to become, semantically speaking, heavy. And as a result, the balanced "polarity of persons" is thrown out of whack by a voracious subjectivity, and the silent purity of corporeal language is sullied by the tedium of talk. If, as Maureen McLane puts it, "intimacy happens if apostrophe works," this success is always an ambivalent one for Hartley, and as a result, his reader's initiation is always incomplete.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
We can get a better grip on this ambivalence if we consider the means by which Hartley communicates to his initiate. The explosion of first-person plurals that accompanies Hartley's occasional rants on the distasteful commercial attempts to provide "ultra-variations" on conventional circus numbers provides a clue: "A terrible show awaited us who think of ourselves as strictly orthodox in circus matters . . . who like our circus 'neat'" and who "like to have our forms keep to form" (<i>C1,</i> 29). "We" are an imagined community of real, orthodox "circus fanatics" open to a language of intimacy that speaks to the eye with special eloquence: "for the circus is the greatest spectacle of joy that has ever been invented for the eye alone&#x02014;the eye being the greatest medium of receptivity," and sight, "as Paul Valery says . . . the most intellectual of the senses" (<i>C1,</i> 3, 1). And "all you have to do at the circus as with everything else&#x02014;open your eyes and keep them open . . . you are I am [<i>sic</i>] talking like a real circus fan" (<i>C1,</i> 60). So, in the following instance, Hartley will attempt to summon the "quality of the thing itself," of the materiality of the circus, through communicative vision and the intimacy that is its goal:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

You must inhale the odors of warm straw of the all but hot fragrances of various animal life&#x02014;and you will want to do like the charming clown did . . . mister clown wrapping his arms around Rosie's trunk saying to her with real emotion "You are such a beautiful girl, Rosie"&#x02014; Rosie seeming to soak up all this affection blinking her right eye as if downward to show some slight acknowledgment of her deep woman's feelings.

The circus is clearly a matter of physical presence, of a proximity that Hartley would intimate to his reader and that he tropes here in the pure, emotive communication of Rosie and "mister clown." "Animal affection," muses Hartley elsewhere, "is a very exceptional affair" (<i>C1,</i> 21-2). The sentiment might be simply laughable if it were not so sincere; indeed, it is not too much to say that Hartley wishes to love and be loved, know and be known, in the mode of relation of Rosie and her trainer: 
</p>

You can pat or even kiss a seal if you want to, and you have been changed, and all it is a kind of transferred affection we may develop among the more tractable animals, when it comes to the wild feline idea&#x02014;you've got something else there, literally . . .

<p>
Here again, intimacy is idealized insofar as it remains controlled, a simple companionship of transferred affection between proximate, knowing bodies. But delivering this sort of corporeal copresence to "you," Hartley's reader, remains seemingly beyond the scope of his evocative language and its synaesthetic aporias, its desire to make the reader see the smells and touches of the circus. As in most publicly mediated intimacies, the "potential failure to stabilize closeness always haunts [the] persistent activity" of Hartley's attempt to posit a "we."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Entrance into this intimate community of "ecstatic 

<b></b>

spectators" is premised not on literal vision but on visionary talk, on the ability of Hartley's language to conjure successfully first an addressee, and beyond that, the vital presence of what he sees and has seen. And this will prove doubly problematic, both because the acrobat's language, like intimacy itself, would eschew speech and aspire to a condition of silence, and because the more Hartley talks about "this vivid human world of the circus," the more it looks like death (<i>C2</i>, 7). 
</p>

<p>
If the success of Hartley's apostrophe is predicated on his ability to open the eye of his addressee and fill it&#x02014;lovingly, erotically&#x02014;with the vital matter of the circus, this communication eventually founders on the very nature of this matter, which proves mutable stuff indeed. The performers themselves appear before Hartley's mnemonic sight only to shimmer, wink, and then disappear: "Alas, what has become of all these little jewel boxes, and will there be found ring artists to keep the great tradition alive?" (<i>C2,</i> 4).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  These characters are so fascinating for Hartley, in part, because in bodying forth sublime pictures of corporeal plenitude, mastery, and beauty, they conjure precisely the opposite: "The public does not know however that very often acute suffering is involved because muscles can stand only so much anyhow, and the life of a circus performer is never any too long, that is, for performing purposes" (<i>C2,</i> 12).
</p>

<p>
Caught between a desire to talk intimately and the urge to keep silent, <i>Elephants</i> achieves an acute poignancy, as community is imagined only to be dissolved, presence is conjured only to be forestalled. Put another way, Hartley's catalogue of circus performers catches an oddly welcome case of <i>le mal d'archive,</i> Jacques Derrida's term for the inescapable loss that corrodes all attempts to archive originary moments of presence, singularity, or contingency.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This double bind&#x02014;incarnated in the short, but intense, life of the circus performer&#x02014;is most obvious when Hartley tries to breathe life into his Metropolitan Opera fantasy of nearly twenty years past by calling for "a grand opera de luxe program of those great artists in this field who are still living and enhance the present day values. There would alas not be a Barbette, there would not be a Grock, there could not be a Joe Jackson, but already I see the idea in outline" (<i>C1</i>, 52-3). Here, though, the vision Hartley would share with his readers cannot be materialized, fully fleshed out, because it is structured around absences: no Barbette, no Grock, no Joe Jackson. So, in one of <i>Elephants'</i>s most remarkable moments, Hartley will transfer his hopes from the real world to the imagination. This attempt to reconcile his desire that the stuff of the circus be, like the elements of Joe Jackson's clownery, "dateless and deathless" (<i>C1,</i> 48), with his sense that the greatest artists "have dropped out from their accustomed spots in the pattern" (<i>C2,</i> 3), is a work of fantasy that dismantles its own assemblage as it builds it in the mind's eye: "Let anyone who has loved this style of show all his life&#x02014;line up in his memory the high spots of his experience&#x02014;and gather his galaxy of splendours for at least one de luxe performance at the Metropolitan Opera" (<i>C1,</i> 37). And headlining Hartley's "galaxy of splendours" are Codona and Leitzel, in a position that signals the centrality of their absence for Hartley and for <i>Elephants,</i> whose rhetorical mode is now in lockstep with what McLane calls the "self-imploding logic of romantic apostrophe" that culminates (or collapses) in the elegiac: "Death pushes apostrophe to its limit; to apostrophize the dead is to 

<b></b>

trace the faultiness always threatening to rupture the fantasy of successful, reciprocal address. Such apostrophe gestures towards the dream of perfect interlocutionary communion even as it undoes it."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In Hartley's case, the failure of apostrophe to posit a presence&#x02014;for McLane, a "drama experienced most painfully and intimately within and by the self"&#x02014;inheres in the position of his most beloved acrobats, Codona and Leitzel, on the sticky seam of private and public.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Their specialty, as it were, is their ability to be intimate and spectacular at once, to encourage attachments in the spectators who enjoy them publicly, but to conceal or absent themselves by virtue of their very publicity. In <i>Elephants</i>, Hartley is drawn, obsessively, to the liminal, libidinal moments where the performers emerge into publicity, or&#x02014;the equally attractive converse&#x02014;when the public spectator goes backstage, inside the performer's dressing chambers. And the ur-moment of backstage pleasure is Hartley's introduction to Leitzel and Codona, a scene that is referred to once in <i>Circus 2</i> and no less than five times in <i>Circus 1:</i>
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

When I had finished with Leitzel for she was getting in the usual state typical of artists, I closed with her by saying "there is one other artist I want to meet and that is Codona"&#x02014;"There he is" she said and he stepped up from the other side and we were introduced&#x02014;and I greeted this bright alert person with "I want to write about you too"&#x02014;"G&#x02014;I'd drop dead if anyone wrote anything nice about me"&#x02014;"well, I am planning to try at least" I said&#x02014;"it may never be printed, but we must all wait and see."

<p>
In this intimate moment Hartley, backstage, talks with his most beloved artists, who are (as they should be, as they almost <i>always</i> are) proximate and yet admired at arm's length. They are clothed, we might say, in the auratic garments of the celebrity image. Leitzel, in a haze of make-up, is "all chiffon and glitter" and talks of her Bohemian descent (though Hartley suspects she is American). Codona, whose public performances Hartley has seen "numbers of times," is unrecognizable, and he and Hartley exchange pleasantries befitting a nervous fan and his object of worship. This chastened intimacy (fan to star) is echoed in the affection between Codona and Leitzel, which, like the performers themselves, like the love between Rosie and Mr. Clown, is "very simple." Their relation is less an index of heteronormative desire than, as Hartley explains in Leitzel's elegy, the ungendered "love of sweet-heart for sweet-heart," or, in a coolly professional register, the "deep admiration of one supreme artist for another" (<i>C1,</i> 85). So too, presumably, Hartley's love for Codona, whose supreme beauty in performance "can only be verified by those," like Hartley, "who have been privileged to see this artist at work numbers of times" (<i>C1,</i> 86). 
</p>

<p>
Strategically occluded in these imaginative revisions is the "ensuing drama" of this pair: after Leitzel died in a public fall from the rings in 1931, Codona married another 

<b></b>

acrobat, Vera Bruce, with whom he performed as "The Flying Codonas." Their tempestuous private relationship was a far cry from the spectacular, simple intimacy of Leitzel-Codona. It ended on July 30, 1937, when they met in a lawyer's office to discuss a property settlement in their divorce. There, Codona shot and killed his wife, before turning the gun on himself. What Hartley will only refer to obliquely as the "Codona madness," then, marks the volatility of this seam between privacy and publicity; it indexes the disaster of a tractable intimacy thrown out of control by the obscenity of the exposed self. In Codona's case, this heaviness is especially devastating. As Hartley explains in "The Flying Man," his curious nonelegy for the acrobat, Codona is the paragon of an "art that pacifies and satisfies completely because for here for once the mouth is stopped&#x02014;the intellect robbed of its powers, and the body is given full play to be its best and comforting self&#x02014;and what is better than a perfect body&#x02014;being itself, completely itself. The body is clean and the life inside and out of it is clean" (<i>C1,</i> 94).<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Now, as Hartley explains in his 1937 poem "The Trapezist's Despair," Codona is "the over-sensuous trapezist," whose "acrobatic vanity" got too heavy. With the amnesia of self-absorption, he forgets that the honorific "butterflies upon the silk of his garments," a costume he first wore in memoriam to Leitzel, were made both to remember and to release&#x02014;to make him light as this "little gauze playmate," who had "flown to the upper air."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  This chilling contrast between res light and heavy is illustrated in a magazine article (. <a href="#4">4</a> and <a href="#5">5</a>) that Hartley tore out and placed in a file of miscellaneous research materials he was collecting for the <i>Elephants</i> project. At the bottom left of the page is a photo of Vera and Alfredo in the midst of "The Passing Leap," which the caption glosses as the "most spectacular display of the Codona's [<i>sic</i>] perfect co-ordination." To the right, another scene of public intimacy, captioned: "Last curtain went down on the Codonas lying side by side as they fell, Vera dying, Alfredo dead."
</p>

<p>
In <i>Elephants</i>, however, Hartley is clearly displeased by this "dead end of love": "I miss . . . Lillian Leitzel and Alfredo Codona, both of whom came to such tragic ends, one by a fall while performing in Copenhagen, and the other by his own hand after the tragic denouement described elsewhere. The which [<i>sic</i>] was to snuff out a romance before their marriage, at which juncture I met them through the kindly offices of Dexter Fellowes in the tent in Brooklyn" (<i>C2,</i> 3). Swiftly, lightly, tragic denouement occasions a comic <i>d&#x000E9;tournement,</i> as Hartley rewrites Codona's death as a necessary erasure, one that facilitates his reunion with Leitzel. Thus, Hartley's grammar of intimacy restores a "celestial bond" of "ideal sweethearts" who had, presumably, been separated "forever by the indifferent spirit of death" (<i>C1,</i> 86). But what of Hartley's affection for Codona, and the sort of intimacy he res? The answer lies, it would seem, in the way Hartley remembers him, bodying forth his object of worship through the alchemy of the imagination: "Codona [had an] almost mystic sense that permits, when the artist wishes to dislodge the body from the idea, and the idea becomes a thing for its own sake; plenty of performers have no doubt done the same thing . . . but they do not have that special magic which is vouchsafed to the pure artist, who strives as it were to fall into the arms of the true meaning of things themselves" (<i>C2,</i> 4).

<p>

Codona's "special magic" is a mystic sense that allows him to transcend mere corporeality (to dislodge the body from the idea) and become a newly hybrid re for the substantiality of fantasy, of flesh-as-idea. The language here effectively duplicates the terms of Hartley's essay "The Element of Absolutism in Leonardo's Drawings" (c. 1939). Like Hartley's Codona, Leonardo's "creatures are of the flesh, but the flesh does not dictate their existence in his vision, he sees them as ideas, as symbolic representations of the whole thing, as the absolutist consummation of one thing" (<i>OA,</i> 291). Codona is no longer a mere body. Only in this way does tragedy become the stuff of comedy, which is sustained not by death and loss but by an aesthetics of mystical intimacy that preoccupied Hartley in roughly the last decade of his life, as he turned firmly away from the excessive personalism of a romantic imagination and toward a selfless art.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  As Hartley explained in 1929, "I want to be life and not myself, and how is one all tinged with questioning and tinged with mystic longings and relations ever to get out of the dull bondage. . . . I don't want to be condemned to spectatorship. I want to be released by it."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  With this release, Hartley revises the aesthetico-mystical imperative as he defined it in <i>Adventures</i>&#x02014;that voracious intimacy of Whitman, whose desire to "include all things into himself" constituted his "strongest esthetical defect" (<i>AIA,</i> 34). Fueled by the mystic writings of George Santayana, Miguel de Unamuno, Lucretius, and others, Hartley finally understood self-annihilation&#x02014;and the perceptual clarity that accompanies it&#x02014;as a goal to be achieved through precisely this spectatorial ecstasy, in which the spectator/artist loses himself in his object of vision, in the sensuous quiddity of the thing. Thus, this self-annihilation must not be understood as a closeted silence, or as the violent repudiation of queer subjectivity, but as the latter's very enactment in the mode of the light re's attached detachment. 
</p>

<p>
Keeping in mind this formulation (subjective release via optical attachment), we might return briefly, and with fresh eyes, to Hartley's puzzling <i>Sustained Comedy&#x02014;Portrait of an Object</i> (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). In the familiar accounts of this work, Hartley's self-portrait has all the gravitas of self-inflicted martyrdom, the body's fleshly surface overwritten with a dense network of images connecting, indeed condemning, the re to the death and loss of the painter's past.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  This subjective weight&#x02014;Whitmanesque in its attempt to include all things <i>onto</i> itself&#x02014;is only compounded by acts of critical decoding, through which superficial symbolism reveals a rich but troubled emotional interior. Read through Codona's butterfly, and through <i>Elephants'</i>s fantastic retelling of the Codona madness, in which elegy gives way to intimacy, the painting may tell another story, now of identity's comic undoing rather than its tragic overdetermination.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  In this story, the titular "comedy" is not bitterly ironic, but an apt description of the intimacy that accompanies mystical release. This reading would underscore how the eye, always an erotic site in Hartley, is penetrated with arrows aflame in butterflies, which ascend and dematerialize with acrobatic buoyancy. Within the logic of such visionary optics, when Hartley seems most firmly physical he is, paradoxically, detached and disembodied, thus laying claim to a privilege historically denied to modernity's others. Released by spectatorship, though, Hartley's disembodiment is no solipsistic idealism, and is less a relational modality for being entirely fantastic. 

<b></b>

</p>

Irreducible to a sublimation or metaphysicalizing of desire, the sustained comedy of Hartley's light res discloses a modern mode of intimacy that is immanent, antisubjectivist, and finally enabled by the affective circuitry of a mediated public sphere. In this sense, Hartley's light res urge us not just to reconsider the nature of modernist detachment, to recover "all that is energizing and active about a depersonalizing tendency," but to do so with sensitivity to the ways that such liberating vectors "away from the psychological and from personal identity itself" emerge in and through changes in modern publicity and visuality.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  The public sphere is, of course, a familiar space of inauthenticity in modernism, guilty, it seems, by association with a disreputable constellation of falsities&#x02014;mass culture, mediation, the feminine, the masses, reproduction, and <i>Erlebnis,</i> to name just a few. Such commonplaces have been productively challenged in recent years, perhaps most forcefully by Miriam Hansen, who argues that the public sphere's value inheres not in its relative authenticity but in its pragmatic utility as a "sensory-reflexive horizon" for negotiating modernity's conflicting energies.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  For me, Hansen's account is compelling insofar as: 1) in understanding publicity as a terrain of experiential negotiation, she refuses to accept lapsarian accounts of the fate of an authentic public sphere in technologically mediated modernity; and 2) she complicates recent critiques of modernism's ideology of authenticity as suspiciously wed to a rejection of a certain logic of visibility. Drawing our attention to what we might call modernism's unseen&#x02014;but no less potent&#x02014;cultural erection, such critics notice the downright dubious trick whereby modernism shores up its authority by secreting authenticity to a private, interior, invisible space.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Here, modernism's strategic inwardness must dismiss a too-visible, too-superficial, and thus inauthentic public meaning. In fact, Bill Brown has described the seeming inevitability of modernist interiority as "the mark of a limit within modernism's effort to accept opacity, to satisfy itself with mere surfaces" and noted how the modernist "effort to accept things in their physical quiddity becomes an effort to penetrate them, to see through them, and to find . . . within an object . . . the subject."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
For my purposes, such trenchant appraisals of a dominant modernist gambit linking vision, authenticity, and privatized interiority serve to underscore the very quirkiness of Hartley's sentimental meditations on these matters. Normative modernism's "iconophobia" has, of course, also been productively considered by queer theory, perhaps most iconically by Eve Sedgwick, who understands modernism's characteristic aversion to realistic representation&#x02014;its currents of antirality and abstraction&#x02014;as a repudiation of sentimentality and of the desired, eroticized male body that is excessive feeling's occasion.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Sentimentality, Sedgwick argues, is less a theme or subject than a vicariously self-implicating "structure of relation, typically one involving the author- or audience-relations of spectacle."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  Hartley's iconophobia, as a painterly technique, was intermittent at best; but his sentimental iconophilia, as a spectatorial mode, was unwavering. The conceptual trick of Hartley's light res, then, is to show how a gushy optical investment is really an erotic divestiture. Take, for example, Hartley's visionary indulgence in the public spectacle of Codona's thingly re&#x02014;his "flesh-as-idea"&#x02014;which effectively flips both Brown's and Sedgwick's formulations: rather than 

<b></b>

penetrating, his vision disperses; rather than implicating the spectator, it finds no subject, only a fleeting attachment that Hartley secures by losing himself. The dominant mode of modernist visuality, as the critical accounts I've discussed here all variously suggest, depends on a series of relatively stable and interlocking binaries (public/private; exteriority/interiority; visibility/invisibility; surface/depth) and privileges the second term in all of them. In Hartley's eyes, by contrast, these binaries are strategically surpassed through his paradoxical formulation of public intimacy, and, beyond that, through modernity's "sensory-reflexive dimension," which is, after all, the light re's affective terrain. In this sense, Hartley's light res emerge alongside, but remain irreducible to, other privileged tropes&#x02014;the "impression," "innervation," or the "fl&#x000E2;neur"&#x02014;for mediating modernism's felt relations between its "insides" and its "outsides" amidst a changing public sphere whose own mediated nature confounds a more traditional trafficking between the latter.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  This would mean understanding the light re as an attempt to think <i>through</i> what Siegfried Kracauer once called the "motley externalities" of modern life, indeed, to revalue the surface as the site not of the experiential poverty of the modern, but rather of its dynamic affective potential: here, for an erotic depersonalization that remains a relation&#x02014;spectacular, to be sure, but also profoundly intimate.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

See Hartley's circus manuscripts, "Circus" and "Elephants and Rhinestones," in the Yale Collection of American Literature (hereafter abbreviated as YCAL), Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. The first is a longer 104-page manuscript written in Hartley's spidery hand; the latter&#x02014;likely a revision&#x02014;is a typescript copy of roughly the first tenth of the earlier version. Hartley tended to type his own manuscripts prior to publication, and the typescript version, in one spot at least, is written over in Hartley's own hand. These two versions are hereafter abbreviated as in the text as <i>C1</i> and <i>C2,</i> respectively. Much of the language of the overlapping material in the two versions of <i>Elephants</i> is identical, though there are provocative changes of phrasing in spots. For example, Hartley describes George Cohan's seat at the Metropolitan Opera, and his own at the circus, as one where he is "at home" in the typescript version, though in <i>C1</i> he describes it as one where "he could really hear the music and feel anonymous at the same time." Taking Hartley's suggestion, I refer to the two manuscripts together as <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>. My transcription of the manuscripts has generally followed the editorial precedents of Gail Scott and Susan Ryan. Like Ryan, I have thought it best not to dabble with Hartley's running prose style, one characterized by an abundance of short and long dashes. Small dashes I have generally converted to commas, keeping the large ones intact. Hartley, <i>C2,</i> 3.

That Hartley should credit Stein's salon for a similar "kind of William James intimacy" is no surprise; Stein, of course, studied under James while a psychology student at Harvard, and in fact loaned Hartley her copy of <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience,</i> which Hartley would claim as a major influence on his work.

I refer here to James's claim in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> that "so long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the symbols of reality, but as soon as we deal with private and personal phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of the term," quoted in McDonnell, "El Dorado," 22; and his definition of self-possession in <i>The Principles of Psychology,</i> quoted in Wolfe, <i>Limits,</i> 78. Susan Ryan has also observed the self-absenting that pervades Hartley's work, noting how Hartley repeatedly "seems drawn to this idea of a centrifugal self-referentiality that leaves the self, itself, out." Again, Hartley's own comments are illustrative in this regard. As he puts it in a letter to Rebecca Strand in 1929, "My main trouble . . . is a passionate desire to eliminate myself. I don't want to be the object of self-interest that one is supposed to be." See Susan Elizabeth Ryan, introduction to <i>Somehow a Past: The Autobiography of Marsden Hartley,</i> ed.

Jonathan Weinberg, one of Hartley's most astute recent critics, characterizes the conflation of the martial and the ludic here as a retroactive dodge: "As if worried by the militarism and eroticism of this description, Hartley attributed his attraction to pageantry to his early love of the circus." This underestimates how, for Hartley, the martial and ludic orders were interchangeable to the extent that they informed a more systematic, theoretical investigation of spectacle&#x02014;and, by extension, of public embodiment and public intimacy&#x02014;that spanned Hartley's entire career.

As his cultural allegiances shifted, Hartley began to transfer the debilities of French culture to the bodies of French men, whom he found "degenerate," "most pitiful to look upon," lacking "in legs[,] and as to carriage and physical demeanor they are dreadful." By contrast, German men, especially German military men like von Freyburg, were "wonderful specimens of health," all "so blonde and radiant with health."

Hartley's suspicion is, of course, correct, and shrewdly identifies a particular stage in the transformation of vaudeville "from a marginalized sphere of popular entertainment, largely associated with vice and masculinity, to a consolidated network of commercial leisure," one which catered to the female consumer with "refined," "respectable," indeed "wholesome" acts&#x02014;opera singers, famous actors from the legitimate stage, Shakespeherian dramas, and the like. This transition was spurred on by the consolidation of the Keith vaudeville circuit, whose bills of entertainment relegated "sight acts" rooted in circus traditions, those acrobatic or animal acts "that could be appreciated despite the noise of arriving or departing customers," to the highly undesirable opening and closing spots. See M. Alison Kibler, <i>Rank Ladies: Gender and Cultural Hierarchy in American Vaudeville</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 5, 152.

Hartley wants to frame the acrobat's body rather than jettison it. Thus, Hartley's notion of masculine ornamentation departs from aestheticism insofar as it rejects the imperative to transcend the materiality of the body, a corporeality associated with "feminine" nature. On the centrality of this mandate to the aestheticist project, see Rita Felski's chapter "Making Masculinity: The Feminization of Writing," in <i>The Gender of Modernity</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995).

Hartley does remark on a more debilitating excess in his critique of the American circus, whose only shortcoming, it seems, is that it is just too spectacular. Whitmanesque in its inclusiveness, it too is a "strain on the eye": it is "too diffused, too enormous in this country to permit of concentrated interest" for any but the most "alert eye." Instead of a integral viewing of the spectacle's masterful orchestration, one "goes away with many little bits." Here though, the circus's distracting, heterogeneous massiveness is, problematically, both a formal and a social problem: "It is because the background is made up of restless nervous dots, all anxious to get the combined quota which they have paid for, when in reality they do not even get any one thing" (<i>AIA,</i> 164-5). Here, Hartley's intimate enjoyment is explicitly threatened by circus dilettantes, which illuminates how Hartley's perceptual attunement to larger patterns outside the self does not always entail an embrace of social plurality. That is, it is not impossible for Hartley to bypass social heterogeneity en route from a local, spectatorial intimacy to a cosmic one, a point of some importance for the terms of his imagined community in <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>.

Indeed, the language of facing or entering the sun recurs often enough in highly cathected contexts that one is tempted to call it a queer nexus in Hartley's work. Consider that, in addition to the instances of solar encounter already cited, Hartley described the dense imagery of his Amerika Series's all-male <i>Indian Fantasy</i>  as the enactment of his racialized dream of "going Indian and traveling 'to the West [to] face the sun forever.'"

Noting the gendered critical discourse that surrounded his work, Brennan speculates that Hartley goes dada in the 1920s because it was cerebral and detached where the Stieglitz circle was premised on an imperative of transparency that outed the painter: "With Dada's characteristic iconoclasm and critique of an authentic self, the movement offered what must have seemed to Hartley like a 'readymade' (if temporary) safe haven from the Stieglitz circle's persistent emphasis on the most intimate aspects of the self" (<i>PGCT,</i> 169-70). This claim is compelling in light of, for example, Hartley's 1928 essay "Art&#x02014;and the Personal Life," in which he admitted to joining "once and for all, the ranks of the intellectual experimentalists. I can hardly bear the sound of the words 'expressionism,' 'emotionalism,' 'personality,' and such, because they imply the wish to express personal life, and I prefer to have no personal life" (<i>OA,</i> 71). However, Brennan's formulation reduces the complexity of Hartley's negotiation of these competing avant-gardes: first, it assumes that Hartley was more prudish about acknowledging his sexual preferences than he was, as his enjoyment of the acrobat in <i>Adventures</i> suggests; second, it follows a broader critical tendency to ignore Hartley's abiding and erotic preoccupation with public spectacle; finally, it suggests that Hartley understood dada as Duchamp or Picabia did, which he did not.

<a name="FOOT40" href="#REF40">40</a>.
See, for example, his implicit definition of dada in another <i>Adventures</i> essay, "The Appeal of Photography": Stieglitz, Hartley notes, "will not care to be called Dada, but it is nevertheless true. He has ridden his own vivacious hobbyhorse with as much liberty, and one may even say license, as is possible for one intelligent human being" (<i>AIA,</i> 111).

If Hartley's hobbyhorse has a genealogy, we might say it is drawn from the toybox of what Richard Sheppard dubs mystical or "triune" dada, whose commitment to a polyphonic subjectivity equipped to negotiate the flux of creation entails imagining res&#x02014;Jean Arp's "Kaspar," Kurt Schwitters's "Anna Blume," Richard Huelsenbeck's "Mafarka," and Tristan Tzara's cosmic acrobats&#x02014;that transcend the binaries they hold in balance: matter and spirit, human and animal, male and female, material world and cosmos. Hartley's acrobat does similar work for the public/private binary. Sheppard draws a useful distinction between the French dadaists Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, who viewed nature as "inherently patternless" and "proclaim[ed] the Dada state of mind <i>against</i> a background of absurdity and chaos," and Zurich dada and the non-Marxist Berlin dadaists, who, by contrast, "were prepared to affirm or at least countenance the coexistence in Nature of chaos and elusive pattern, dynamism and fluid structure." Hartley's embrace of flux and his desire to be merged into pattern aligns him clearly with the latter. See Sheppard's chapter "Radical Cheek: Or, Dada Reconsidered," in <i>Modernism-Dada-Postmodernism</i> (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 2000), 193; italics in original.

That the order of paragraphs, if such it can be called, remains unchanged in two versions of <i>Elephants</i> suggests that, just as in his autobiography, <i>Somehow a Past,</i> Hartley's narrative mode here is purposefully episodic and associative.

In this sense, <i>Elephants</i> returns to Hartley's interest in the autobiographical mode as a means of exploring the connection between vision and memory, and of gauging the potential of what Ryan calls "synthetic visual memory," wherein "the form visually scrutinized and the imprint on the mind of the form once seen come together in an act that is partly sensory and partly mechanical, but that is equally intimate and emotive&#x02014;a compound of viewer and viewed." As Ryan notes, Hartley flirted with autobiography throughout his life, starting with the essay "Concerning Fairy Tales and Me" and, I would argue, culminating in <i>Elephants</i>. Ryan, introduction to <i>Somehow,</i> 2. However, I mean to distinguish Hartley's use of an intersubjective rhetorical mode here from Ryan's remarks on the intimate nature of Hartley's autobiographical experiments in vision in <i>Somehow a Past</i>. Ryan insists that the hermeticism of such efforts differs from that of Stein and Alice B. Toklas: "As opposed to the latter's externalized viewpoint that constructs a self always in the eyes of the other, Hartley's manuscript is clearly the voice of a man alone, talking to a reader who seems to be himself" (ibid., 2, 25)

<i>Elephants</i> brings Hartley repeatedly to the deterioriation and death of his beloved performers. The charming mimic, Eva Tanguay? "Poor dear, now over sixty and helpless in bed." His description of high-wire performer Bird Millman ends simply, "heard lately she died&#x02014;in want" (<i>C1,</i> 11).

McLane, "Rhetoric," 439. McLane's essay reformulates the dark logic of Paul de Man's well-known deconstructive essay, "Autobiography as De-facement." There, through an analysis of the metaphoric language of Wordsworth's epitaphs, de Man demonstrated "the impossibility of closure and of totalization (that is, the impossibility of coming into being) of all textual systems based on tropological substitutions." Thus, de Man laid bare how any system of cognition built on language cannot but forestall presence: "to the extent that language is re . . . it is indeed not the thing itself but the representation, the picture of the thing and, as such, it is silent, mute as pictures are mute. Language, as a trope, is always privative." This is especially unsettling in the genre of autobiography, which presumes to "reveal reliable self-knowledge," but in underlying the inescapable "tropology of the subject," "deprives and disres to the precise extent that it restores."

Even if we suppose that Hartley wrote "The Flying Man" before Codona's death in 1937, which is unlikely, his choice neither to include the details of this death in <i>Elephants</i> nor to elegize Codona as he does Leitzel is a striking disavowal of the denouement of the Codona madness.

Critics have read the painting as a strongly emblematic work of mourning and a conflation of death and homosexual desire not unlike the War Motif series: the flaming arrows allude to St. Sebastian, and beyond that, to a gay subculture; the pierced heart, like the ship, recalls Hart Crane, the gay poet whose suicide by drowning Hartley had commemorated in his earlier work <i>Eight Bells Folly: Memorial for Hart Crane</i> ; "the rose on his shoulder and the Christ re recall the various paintings associated with the Mason family," a Nova Scotian fishing family whom Hartley befriended and with whom he lived during the summers of 1935 and 1936, and whose sons Alty and Donny, beloved by Hartley, were drowned at sea in July of 1936; the "form of the painting, with a single re placed in the center against a dark background, over which the various symbols are collaged, is a reprise of the war motif series" (<i>SV,</i> 188).

Ever since Woolf's recuperation by feminists in the 1970s, critics have attempted to overcome the powerful stereotype of her as a fragile genius, unconnected with the world. This view, so dominant in <i>Recollections of VirginiaWoolf by Her Contemporaries</i>, and more recently in the book and movie <i>The Hours</i>, has been difficult to dislodge. Fortunately, these three books confirm Woolf's deep engagement in the social and political world of her times. Black and Cuddy-Keane concentrate on Woolf as a professional writer, as someone who had to meet deadlines, work with editors, and persuade readers. Cuddy-Keane examines how Woolf responded to specific political events, while Black integrates Woolf's lifelong feminism with her anti-war arguments. Humm concentrates on Woolf and her sister, Vanessa Bell, as amateur photographers, showing how their fascination with contemporary visual technologies affected their work. All three would agree that this quintessential modernist appeals to a post-modern sensibility in her insistent creation of multiple layers and points of view. Like Woolf, all are very aware of their own critical biases.
</p>

<p>
These authors acknowledge a characteristic that either endears or annoys readers: Woolf's repeated use of ironic fantasy, or what Black 

<b></b>

calls her "dense, whimsical, and semi-academic style" . Each effectively defends Woolf's idiosyncratic style for its effective balancing of different arguments and positions. To paraphrase Woolf, they see her as one of the few English writers writing for grown-up people. Black notes how Woolf insisted that readers undertake an imaginative engagement with her argument by the use of provocative asides, digressions from the subject at hand, and a discordant combination of anger and humor. Cuddy-Keane concludes that Woolf's elliptical style encouraged her readers to think for themselves. Humm compliments Woolf's sophisticated use of "photographic tropes of illumination and reflection" , which draw attention to the elusive, evanescent nature of reality. These critics each provide such good close readings of Woolf's essays that I wish they had considered more fully the stylistic relationship between her nonfiction and fiction. Woolf's unique critical voice combines fact and fiction in psychologically and politically unsettling ways that are well worth exploring. 
</p>

<p>
There is surprisingly little overlap in these three studies. Woolf was so prolific that each author emphasizes different works. The most broadly based book is Cuddy-Keane's careful dissection of Woolf as a public intellectual. Her opening chapter on the interwar debate about education, mass culture and politics is especially strong. She documents Woolf's carefully argued position on the value of independent learning, of an individual's thoughtful engagement with books, ideas and ideologies. Cuddy-Keane labels Woolf a "democratic highbrow," which seems to me a perfect description of Woolf's mixture of elitism and social responsibility. Woolf had no illusions that everyone could be a sophisticated reader, but she always believed this to be a politically important goal for modern British citizens. Moreover, she especially wanted women of all social classes to benefit from a proper education. Woolf vehemently opposed any curriculum that was a watered-down version of middle-class culture; for her it was a repugnant perpetuation of second-hand ideas. A later chapter explores why Woolf always loathed honors, awards and hierarchies, whether for persons or for books. She opposed, for example, F. R. Leavis's creation of a canon of English literature, but she urged her readers toward specific English masterpieces. Especially during the 1930s, when literary commentators on all sides used a hard-edged political style, Woolf's personal, distinctively feminist voice seemed outdated. Her multilayered argument, with its ironic twists and turns, now seems far more supple and intelligent than most of the self-righteous criticism of the interwar years. Cuddy-Keane's book should be required reading for anyone interested in the intellectual and cultural history of modernism.
</p>

<p>
Cuddy-Keane analyzes Woolf's writing style, while Black explicates the often-difficult content of her essays. Both critics, for example, discuss Woolf's 1920 polemical essay, "The Plumage Bill." Cuddy-Keane situates it in terms of audience and purpose, noting that Massingham's sexist attack on "child-bearing" women who wore feathers appeared in <i>The Nation</i>, a left-leaning weekly, whereas Woolf's reply appeared in the <i>Women's Leader</i>, whose readers were largely female and feminist. She concentrates on the various twists or "wobbles" Woolf takes to convince her readers that the real enemies of endangered egrets are not women, but rather male hunters and sellers of feathers. For Cuddy-Keane, Woolf's ironies "indict men for violence and, at the same time, problematize this indictment" . Throughout her book, Cuddy-Keane notes the power of Woolf's conversational style as an effective strategy for chastising her adversaries without turning them into enemies. Although she admits that readers did not always understand Woolf's subtle arguments, she does not fault her for political failure. Black, a political scientist, is more concerned with results than with rhetorical strategies. Since Massingham dismissed Woolf as sectarian, Black concludes, "Irony, comedy, and exaggeration have, as they will so often in the future, both leavened her prose and confused, then angered a 'progressive' audience" . Cuddy-Keane is always stimulating and thoughtful, but I wish she had been more willing to discuss the limitations of Woolf's methods. Moreover, it is surprising that she does not include <i>Three Guineas</i> in her purview. Fortunately, Black's thorough study compensates for this lack, but I longed for Cuddy-Keane's subtle textual analysis of this complex book.
</p>

<p>
Black, an editor of the Shakespeare Head edition of <i>Three Guineas</i>, examines Woolf's feminism through the lens of this late book. While an earlier generation of feminist critics saw Woolf as a great foremother, Black places her back in her own times. She carefully enumerates Woolf's various political commitments, showing how often she was called upon to give a lecture, attend 

<b></b>

a meeting, sign a petition, or donate money. And Woolf did so, repeatedly. Through friends and relatives, she was in contact with all the major suffrage organizations, including the working-class Women's Cooperative Guild. In the 1920s and 1930s, Woolf supported the post-suffrage London and National Society for Women's Service, which lobbied Parliament on women's issues. She also supported the Women's Employment Federation, which worked to widen women's job opportunities. Given her deep commitment to women's self-education, Woolf was a loyal benefactor of the Fawcett Library; from March 1938 until her death, she agreed to pay for the books they ordered and she donated many of the books footnoted in <i>Three Guineas</i> . 
</p>

<p>
Black's major focus, however, is on Woolf's feminist theory, which she sees as a coherent attack on all forms of patriarchy. Black reminds us of how radical her ideas were (and are). For example, Woolf hoped for "economic independence and privacy . . . as well as for egalitarian, nonviolent families" . Politicians have never seriously considered her call for a "living wage" for wives. Woolf also wanted women to have an education as good as men's, including the freedom to travel and live independently. During the interwar years, women faced many barriers to economic self-sufficiency; upon marriage, many women legally lost their jobs. Rather than condemning Woolf for her utopian solutions to social problems, Black suggests the importance of Woolf's stand against all patriarchal institutions. For her, Woolf'sfeminism is deeply radical, asking for profound changes in society, rather than simply calling for equal opportunities with men or for valuing women's unique contributions. <i>Three Guineas</i> is not so much a feminist manifesto against war as it is a "transformative argument"  showing "that the educational and professional structures of public life, which exclude women, are intrinsically hierarchical, and therefore the basic causes of war" . 
</p>

<p>
Black focuses entirely on explicating <i>Three Guineas</i>, clarifying its complex argument and style. Her book has a somewhat old-fashioned feel; it is accessible, clear and modest in its aims. More speculation about Woolf's general methods, as well as a consideration of the poor responses to this carefully constructed book, would have strengthened her analyses. For example, Black reminds readers of the frequent deletion of the five photographs of men in public rituals from various editions of <i>Three Guineas</i>, but her conclusion is predictable. For Black, the photographs of a general, a judge, an archbishop, an academic procession, and a row of buglers all in full regalia, underscore "the absence of women from the formal ceremonial contexts that attest to public power" . She notes the very negative reception of these photographs among Woolf's male friends, but does not extend her interpretation beyond this point. Why were these photographs so frequently deleted from later editions of <i>Three Guineas</i>? Were they too inflammatory or too distracting? In this richly detailed study, Black could tell us more about the ways in which feminism was forced to the margins of political debate by the late 1930s even among sympathetic men.
</p>

<p>
In sharp contrast, Humm's analysis of <i>Three Guineas</i> spends little time on either the political context or the five photographs. Instead, she discusses Woolf's descriptions of absent photographs of dead mothers and children during the Spanish Civil War. Her exploration of the "dense visual plenitude" of <i>Three Guineas</i> offers fascinating and provocative new insights into this allusive work. Humm considers Woolf's descriptions of photographs of dead women and children emblematic of "experiences unacknowledged by patriarchy," a point with which Black would agree. She stretches her argument further, however, to suggest that the female narrator's memories of these photographs and her revulsion against them are corporeal signs of gender difference. Readers may balk at her Lacanian reading, which insists upon an essentialized notion of a "specifically female modernist memory," based on "corporeal affect" . She comes perilously close to reducing the absent photographs to "female modernist memory" and the published photographs of powerful men to symbols. Her focus on how "photographs and visual memories can reveal a gendered subjectivity"  gives her argument clarity and energy, yet surely at the loss of political force. Faced with an imminent war that placed her husband in grave danger, Woolf may not have seen patriarchal leaders as simply "fetishes of the symbolic," but rather as very real and present dangers to women and Jews. The photographs were neither jokes nor symbols, as her peers knew. As Black so convincingly argues, Woolf's aim in <i>Three Guineas</i> went beyond the creation of a gendered subjectivity; she intended to call into question patriarchy itself. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Humm's book is most valuable in its detailed discussions of Vanessa and Virginia Stephen's early and long-lasting fascination with photography. Here her argument that photographs are carriers of gendered memories is original and persuasive. Humm portrays an artist and a writer who quickly and easily incorporated into their work the visual possibilities of both photography and film. In the surviving photograph albums, Woolf did not arrange her photographs in any artistic or chronological order, nor did she winnow them, throwing away out-of-focus or poorly framed photographs. For Humm, these casual, intimate snapshots are a rich source for documenting the domestic as an integral part of the modernist movement. Humm contends that when Woolf repeatedly places the same sitters in similar poses, it suggests an unconscious return to an earlier "visual event." For her, this is an 1892 family photograph of her parents reading on a sofa, with the young Virginia in the background. It is pasted into one of Woolf's albums, out of chronological order, but close to a single, formal portrait of her mother. Humm argues that the family photograph is in dialogue with the many other informal photographs of Woolf's friends and living family members. Her psychoanalytic approach works well here, illuminating the complex ways in which both Bell and Woolf reconstituted the maternal in their art and fiction. 
</p>

<p>
For many readers the most interesting part of Humm's book will be her tactful dissection of Vanessa Bell's photographs of her children. Humm is consistently respectful and sensible, avoiding both impossible claims for Bell's motivations and twenty-first century judgments. Bell's family albums contain approximately fifty photographs of naked children and ten of naked children with fully clothed adults. They were highly unusual at the time, and Humm sees them as examples of Bell's "fresh and powerful engagement" with feminine modernity . Humm reads the photographs for their eroticism and artistry, as well as the reciprocal, active participation of the subjects. Julian, the eldest son, for example, repeatedly looks directly at the camera. Humm notes how some of the photographs echo those that Bell's aunt, Julia Margaret Cameron, took in the 1860s. Bell contextualized the nude photographs in unexpected ways; album pages include different shots taken at different times, so that, unlike Woolf, she created a sequence and narrative with her photographs. Bell constantly placed a nude portrait with photographs of herself posing with the children, or even out-of-focus shots of them playing and posing. For Humm, these juxtapositions situate the erotic in a more conventional context that finds pleasure in visual repetition. She concludes that these photographs show Bell making "her art part of a natural, everyday, non-hierarchical world" . As someone who has never cared for Bell's art, I found Humm's discussion valuable for raising larger issues about the tensions between the formal, expressive goals of visual art and Bell's effort to include everyday moments in that art. Humm is less successful in her quick rundown of feminist writers on early silent films, but I valued her insistence on taking seriously the different ways in which women artists and writers incorporated new visual materials into their work. 
</p>

<p>
Humm is the most invested in current theoretical trends, and offers the most imaginative reconstruction of Woolf as an author; other critics will mine her insights, developing further the connections between photography and modernist writing. Black sticks closely to her texts, but the result is a definitive study of <i>Three Guineas</i>. Her book will be required reading for anyone interested in feminist political theory. If Humm is perhaps too trendy, Black at times seems too literal in her interpretations of an author who reveled in metaphor and fantasy. Cuddy-Keane draws from a variety of critical sources, including not only Foucault, but also Bakhtin, Bourdieu, and Pratt. Her flexible approach to Woolf's nonfiction yields fresh insights that illuminate Woolf's major fiction. Each author demonstrates how important Woolf's thinking continues to be in the twenty-first century. 
</p>

<p>
In early 1933, the feminist composer Ethel Smyth tried to sum up the personality of Virginia Woolf: "She is arrogant intellectually beyond words&#x02014;yet absolutely humble about her own great gift. Her integrity chiefly fascinates me, I think. To save your life, or her own, she could not doctor what she thinks to be the truth. . . . How far V. is human I don't know. She is very moody&#x02014;incalculable&#x02014;&amp; has never been known to admit that she can be in the wrong. And yet you love her&#x02014;love her."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Each of these three authors tackles Woolf's profound intellectual and personal integrity, showing her consistent engagement with the major issues of her day. I hope they will also lay to rest the false notion that Woolf refused to engage in the political issues of her 

<b></b>

day. Best of all, reading these books has reminded me of why so many people love reading Woolf and reading about Woolf; indeed, why her work is continually worthy of reinterpretation for each new generation of students and scholars.

In 1941, the Jewish-American writer Gertrude Stein embarked on one of the strangest intellectual projects of her life: translating and introducing for an American audience the speeches of Marshal Philippe P&#x000E9;tain, head of state of the collaborationist Vichy government. During the next two years, from 1941 to 1943, Stein translated some thirty-two of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches into English, including those that announced Vichy policy barring Jews and other "foreign elements" from positions of power in the public sphere, and those that called for a "hopeful" reconciliation with Nazi forces. The last of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches that Stein translated was from August 1941, but Stein did not cease working on the project until January or February 1943&#x02014;several months after the Germans had occupied P&#x000E9;tain's Free France in November of 1942, and long after the United States had entered the war against the fascist forces Stein was promoting to her fellow Americans. Never published, the translation manuscript was forgotten from Stein's death in 1946 until critic Wanda Van Dusen effectively "outed" the project as a work of Vichy propaganda in a 1996 issue of .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Van Dusen's own untimely death arrested this investigation, and since then&#x02014;notwithstanding a recent expos&#x000E9; in <i>The New Yorker</i> on Stein's Vichyite activities&#x02014;there has been no sustained scholarly interpretation of the translation project's significance.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Why and under what terms would Stein undertake to translate P&#x000E9;tain's speeches for an American audience? Van Dusen's analysis focuses on the introduction Stein wrote to accompany the translation project, finding in it ample proof that Stein was a willing collaborator, that she signed on to the project out of ideological 

<b></b>

conviction and commitment to the re of the Mar&#x000E9;chal. Stein's lifelong belief in "internal essences" and her fetishization of the re of the general or "great man" inform Van Dusen's critique, which also works to counter our contemporary understanding of Stein as an intellectual and artistic iconoclast&#x02014;seemingly the least likely person to engage actively with the production of fascist ideology.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In Van Dusen's analysis, Gertrude Stein the unquestionably "progressive" writer&#x02014;the originator, in works like <i>Three Lives</i> (1904-06), <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1912-14), and <i>The Making of Americans</i> (1903-12), of a radically antiauthoritarian, antipatriarchal poetics&#x02014;becomes Stein the willfully unseeing, pro-Vichy mythographer. Interestingly, what Van Dusen fails to mention&#x02014;that Stein pursued the P&#x000E9;tain translation project into 1943&#x02014;is perhaps the most shocking aspect of this strange undertaking. It is one thing to profess the belief, shared with much of the French population, that P&#x000E9;tain would save France from the internal and external forces that had brought it to its difficult pass in 1940; but Stein's unwavering commitment to the translation project in the face of an obviously changing political climate&#x02014;and in the face of massive, state-sponsored deportations of Jews from the region in France where Stein was living&#x02014;is hard to comprehend. In short, Stein's efforts seem to go above and beyond what was needed to be seen as accommodationist toward the Vichy regime. 
</p>

<p>
Van Dusen's analysis has been criticized for its tendentiousness,<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  but it remains a powerful indictment of Stein; still, what is lacking in her essay is any analysis of the translations themselves, including their gaps and silences, the points of struggle and even resistance written into the very texts. The ready condemnation of Stein as a Vichy collaborator seems to foreclose a more nuanced reading of the "collaborationist" texts themselves (just as, for too long, analyses of Stein's aesthetic have tended to ignore the historical and political context within which she was writing). Indeed, no scholar has yet attempted a close reading of the translations, nor placed them in the context of Stein's own problematic relationship to the task of translation as it emerged in the early 1930s. This essay will aim to do that, focusing on both the literary/linguistic aspects of Stein's translations and on their historical/biographical context. I will suggest that whatever the terms of Stein's decision to embark on the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, there is little doubt that it occasioned both anxiety and uncertainty: if this was a performance in support of Vichy, it was not one of absolute conviction. Beyond the fact that Stein entered into this project at a moment of grave personal threat, and possibly in exchange for her own safety, there is also a disjunction between the way the speeches are translated and their larger propagandistic goal. Hence the conviction that Van Dusen sees in Stein's introduction to the translations needs to be weighed against the feeling of coercion that seems to underlie the translations themselves, as though "something outside" were compelling Stein to produce a form of writing antithetical to her aesthetic principles. Seen in light of Stein's early professed <i>resistance</i> to the very idea of translation, her central belief in "genius," and her uneasy relationship to audiences, the P&#x000E9;tain project seems doubly strange: an anomalous undertaking in relation to the rest of Stein's oeuvre, and one that, I will argue, needs to be placed within the historical context of Stein's lived experience during the Second World War. The point here is 

<b></b>

not to justify the P&#x000E9;tain project, but rather to interrogate any easy verdict of "collaboration" as it appears at first glance to pertain to the case of Stein.

<p class="noIndent">
The P&#x000E9;tain translations reside in a folder in the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University: several manuscript notebooks, a few typed pages, and the typescript of the introduction Stein wrote to accompany the translations. The first speech translated is P&#x000E9;tain's address of 1936, delivered at the inauguration of a monument to the veterans of Capoulet-Junac; the last, P&#x000E9;tain's 1940 Christmas address. Stein followed the erratic chronology of the original text, <i>Paroles aux Fran&#x000E7;ais; messages et &#x000E9;crits 1934-1941,</i> translating approximately the first half of the fifty speeches published. Still, she leaves some speeches untranslated, and it is interesting to speculate as to why. Speeches discussing the education of French youth, regional administration, and French legionnaires may have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of popular American audience Stein was ostensibly trying to court, but Stein also leaves untranslated a speech on Franco-Canadian relations which argues for cross-cultural understanding, and a speech announcing P&#x000E9;tain's desire to form a Supreme Court "as is found in the United States."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Whether or not these omissions were deliberate, they raise a central question: was Stein herself involved in the selection of these translations, or was she a mouthpiece for someone else's directives?
</p>

<p>
Stein's notoriously bad handwriting is especially pronounced on these pages, and the manifold corrections in the hand of Alice Toklas only exacerbate the difficulty of reading. But what is most striking about the text is its literal rendering of the French original. Translating word by word, Stein completely ignores questions of idiom or style: "Telle est, aujourd'hui, Fran&#x000E7;ais, la tache &#x000E0; laquelle je vous convie" becomes "This is today french people the task to which I urge you" (<i>PF,</i> 88).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  An idiomatic phrase such as "Le 17 juin 1940, il y a aujourd'hui une ann&#x000E9;e" (<i>PF,</i> 121) becomes "On the seventeenth of June 1940 it is a year today." "Ils se m&#x000E9;prendront les uns et les autres" (<i>PF,</i> 165)&#x02014;a speech denouncing P&#x000E9;tain's critics&#x02014;is translated "But they are mistaken the ones and the others." Syntax is distorted: a speech describing the refugees from the Lorraine notes the abandonment of "le cimeti&#x000E8;re o&#x000F9; dorment leurs anc&#x000EA;tres" (<i>PF,</i> 177); Stein translates this as "their cemeteries where sleep their ancestors." Even the term "speech" is avoided: "Discours du 8 juillet" (<i>PF,</i> 125) becomes "Discourse of the 8 July." 
</p>

<p>
Given Stein's apparent goal to familiarize an American audience with P&#x000E9;tain's words, these translations seem incongruous, even inept. Arguably, this is the work of a writer with little or no real familiarity toward the foreign language being translated. Alice Toklas's corrections&#x02014;more copious and directive than in other of Stein's texts she copyedited&#x02014;affirm this assessment of Stein as a bungling student reaching beyond her linguistic depth. Yet the weakness of the translations seems to belie Stein's fluency as a reader and relative fluency as a writer of French at this point in her life.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Not only had Stein long been a reader of French&#x02014;her early reading of Flaubert's <i>Trois Contes</i> 

<b></b>

had famously informed her breakthrough experimental text, <i>Three Lives</i>&#x02014;but she had recently finished an original composition in French (<i>Picasso,</i> 1938). More than a decade before the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, moreover, she had felt confident enough to embark on a translation into English of a text that would stretch the skills even of a Francophone: the poem cycle <i>Enfances</i> by the French surrealist poet Georges Hugnet. 
</p>

<p>
Placing the P&#x000E9;tain project in the context of the earlier Hugnet project proves illuminating. In 1930, Stein offered to translate George Hugnet's <i>Enfances</i> into English as a favor in return for Hugnet's own translation and publication, a year earlier, of sections of <i>The Making of Americans</i>. Translating Hugnet was an ambitious task, given the length and complexity of the original. Stein soon ran into difficulties with the project, although in her own retrospective account she insisted that these difficulties had nothing to do with either her own language skills or with <i>Enfances</i>. Rather, it was the very act of translation that preoccupied and disconcerted Stein: changing a text from its original into another form seemed to her to be, ultimately, a passive rather than a creative act, an act of "carrying out an idea already which was already existing," of conveying a "recognition [that] was prepared beforehand."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Translation thus became the signifier for a mode of writing that threatened the nature of what she called "genius." 
</p>

<p>
This is a more complex problem for Stein than one might initially think. For Stein, "genius" was a key term, descriptive most notably and notoriously of her own essential type (as when she has Alice Toklas extravagantly identify her in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> as one of "only . . . three first class geniuses" Alice has ever met).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Yet Stein also described "genius" as precisely that which resisted typologization: an ongoing <i>process of dialogue</i> between self and other, subject and object, inside and outside: a process of relationality between two entities, or even two signs. In <i>Lectures in America</i>  she refers to "being a genius" complexly as "being one who is at the same time talking and listening," a phrase that emphasizes both "being" (Stein the genius/type) and dialogic process ("at the same time talking and listening") (<i>LA,</i> 170).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  There is a crucial tension in this and other similar descriptions between "genius" as authorial originality and "genius" as an ideal relationality, a process of pure difference between two entities; at a certain point Stein would even attempt to resolve this tension by claiming that "[i]f the same person does the talking and the listening why so much the better" (<i>LA,</i> 170). Suffice it to say that this tension, as we shall see, would inform and indeed trouble Stein's relationship to "the outside" over the course of the 1930s and 1940s. In <i>Lectures,</i> Stein would acknowledge that it was the task of translating <i>Enfances</i> that first brought home to her the seeming incommensurability of "genius" and "the outside." For the act of translating seemed to suck the life out of "genius" in both its senses: not only was the translator herself considered to be a derivative form of the original genius-author, adopting what translation theorist Lawrence Venuti describes as a "weird self-annihilation" by erasing from her own text any discursive peculiarities in order to render the original into another form of itself.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Moreover, in the act of translation there seemed to be no possibility to engage in the textual process of "talking and listening": what mattered most is that a translation "never call attention to itself."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In a series of retrospective comments on the Hugnet project, Stein sets up an opposition between "dead" translation and living "vibration" in writing, using this also as an occasion to reflect upon the difference between Shakespeare's plays and his sonnets. Shakespeare's plays achieve the textual relationality that Stein calls "genius": "In the plays [words] make the lively sound and if they mean what they said they mean it because a lively sound can as it will or if it does mean what is said" (<i>FA,</i> 135). The plays liberate and enliven the sign, creating unexpected and surprising connections between signs and between signifiers and signifieds. Meaning emerges potentially ("as it will") or not at all ("or if it does"); what matters is textual "liveliness." Stein calls this "writing as it is being written." In comparison, Stein writes, "[t]he words in the sonnets come out with a smooth feeling with no vibration in them such as the words in all his plays have as they come out from them" (<i>N,</i> 52). The sonnets represent "what some one told him to do"; they show an awareness of an outside audience, but do not achieve a genial relationality with this audience. Stein calls this "writing as it has been written," emphasizing derivation and mimicry; this, she writes, is the kind of lifeless writing that is expected from translation. Like Shakespeare's sonnets, a translation "recreate[s] the point of view of somebody else";<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  the translated signs thereby lose their "vibration," and the work that repeats or rerenders these signs in a new language is "dead." What kills the translated text in particular, Stein writes, are the relentless pressures of an "outside," an audience, demanding that the writer write not "his way" but "some way of somebody's" (<i>FA,</i> 130). The dialogic emphasis of what Stein calls "genius" is given over, in the act of translation, to what Georges Hugnet himself would claim the "prior right" of the original author. Such a claim would prove deeply disturbing to Stein, not only because it would preclude the possibility of "talking and listening" but because it would remind her that her own "prior right" had been eclipsed. Again, there is a profound tension in Stein's attitude to the Hugnet project, as in her theory of "genius," between a professed commitment to an antiessentialist textual dialogism and her essentialist need to write "[her] way" rather than "some way of somebody's." Despite her idealization of "talking and listening" as a privileged mode of textual engagement, Stein remained troubled by any situation that turned her into a "listener" rather than a "talker," a scribe rather than an innovator. The Hugnet project threatened both of these senses of "genius." Stein's response to this threat was to "translate" <i>Enfances</i> by altering the essential terms of translation itself.
</p>

<p>
If what translation lacked was the "vibrating" sense of discovery and possibility found in talking and listening, then Stein approached <i>Enfances</i> with this idea in mind. In her presentation of <i>Enfances'</i>s central theme of sexual discovery and arousal, for example, Stein "listens and talks" to the powerful awakenings of a specifically male sexuality, deftly turning this imagery on its head:

takes the confessional voice of Hugnet's original and fashions a more abstract, more degendered portrait of sexual awakening. No "moist hands" manipulate the poetic "I" in Stein's version; instead, Stein's text res arousal ("a well inside") as the effect of strangely disembodied "hands untied," an effect emphasized by the repetition of the semantically neutral phrase "there is." Although Stein's version could be termed a feminist rewriting of a phallocentric original&#x02014;a claim that makes sense if we consider Stein's substitution of the womblike "well inside" for Hugnet's masculine "sexe"&#x02014;there is also something radically, <i>grammatically</i> open-ended about Stein's "translation," something that precludes reference entirely. Marjorie Perloff describes this and other sections in Stein's <i>Enfances</i> translation as achieving "the dissolution of the coherent 'lyric voice' as controlling presence in the poetic text. . . . Nothing is taken for granted; nothing is quite what it seems to be."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  "Listening" to Hugnet's text and "talking back" to it, Stein creates oblique, metonymic connections between original and copy that obscure authorial intention and unhinge stable referentiality. This is less a translation than a "translation," in the modernist sense: a deconstructive rereading that decenters and puts into play the terms of the original. 
</p>

<p>
Like other of Stein's experimental texts, the <i>Enfances</i> translation appears to exemplify what feminist critics have long praised about Stein's writing: its "dialogic form, in which difference may enter without being relegated to a secondary position or subsumed under an authoritarian identity."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Yet it is telling that Stein also felt her "reflection"<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  of <i>Enfances</i> to be an independent work of original genius; her insistence that she get equal billing on the title page of the printed volume was justified because, she felt, "he had done his and R&#x000E8;had done mine."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Needless to say, Hugnet resisted Stein's request, reasoning that

The choice of terms here is telling. "Collaboration" implies a joint effort, with each side sharing equal responsibility for the final product; it is a term of association between

equals. Hugnet's notion of the translator's task, by comparison, is one of assistance or mediation: the translator midwifes the original text, bringing forth in a new vocabulary and idiom another form of the same, yet maintaining intact the hierarchy of original and translation; the text remains the "sole responsibility" of its original author. Hugnet's fundamental disagreement with Stein over translation in general and over parity on the title page ultimately spelled the end of their friendship. When finally published in <i>Pagany</i> , <i>Enfances</i> and Stein's "translation" of it were presented on opposite pages, with Stein's work bearing the dismissive title "Poem Pritten on the Pfances of Georges Hugnet." She eventually republished her version alone in a Plain Edition volume, appropriately entitled "Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded." For the next decade Stein would limit herself to writing original compositions and meditating on some of the problems first raised by the Hugnet project. Then, around 1941, she suddenly began working on the translation of Philippe P&#x000E9;tain's speeches.

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's refusal to become "invisible" in the Hugnet translation makes her later, slavishly literal translation of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches seem even more anomalous. To be sure, <i>Enfances</i> and P&#x000E9;tain's speeches occupy very different textual registers, aesthetic and political; moreover, the allusive language of Hugnet could be said to require a different kind of translational treatment from the French of P&#x000E9;tain, with its commitment to brevity, clarity, and abbreviation.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In the hands of another translator, such textual and linguistic differences would be significant. Yet one would assume that Stein's lifelong interest in transforming, subverting, and revising language and genre would be operative here as well: that the translation of P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, like the Hugnet translation, would be largely an exercise in what Donald Sutherland calls Stein's "overwhelming rhetorical agility."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  One would imagine that P&#x000E9;tain, like Hugnet, would have stimulated Stein's urge to "talk back" to the authoritative original, deconstructing its claims to mastery while emphasizing her own genial authority. In fact, this agility seems absent from the P&#x000E9;tain translation project: there is no playful questioning of the terms and conditions of public speaking or political rhetoric in these translations. Something appears to have shifted not only in her relationship to the "outside" text but also in her complex sense of "genius" as a guiding aesthetic principle.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that this shift is linked to a crucial development in Stein's career over the course of the 1930s: the emergence of a public audience for her work. With the sudden and overwhelming success of <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> in 1933, Stein not only discovered what she had desired for years&#x02014;"la gloire"&#x02014;but also found herself in a new relationship to what she would increasingly refer to as "something outside me": a large, popular audience, placing new demands on her ability to "talk and listen." It is important to recall that her idea of "genius" was crafted during Stein's many years of relative public marginality; with initially no one, and then only a few select readers willing to read her texts, the notion of "talking and listening" became a 

<b></b>

crucial one to describe both the self-directed monologue of the high modernist writer and the elite process of engagement and transformation between this writer and her devoted coterie. For those who dared be "ostracized . . . with God," as Mina Loy wrote in her self-referential "Apology of Genius," the rewards were evident.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Stein's belief in the necessity that "genius" trump other concerns, as we have seen, informs her refusal to become "invisible" in the Hugnet project as well as her privileging of Shakespeare's plays over his sonnets, since the former appear to be written "his way" rather than "some way of somebody's." At the same time, Stein acknowledged feeling keen envy whenever one of her fellow modernists achieved a measure of popular recognition. With the success of <i>The Autobiography</i> Stein finally got what she thought she wanted: an audience of her American contemporaries, an educated, well-read, mostly middle-class set of readers. Yet this was an audience that preferred its modernism to be "explained" before (or instead of) consuming it, and Stein almost immediately felt the constraints of this necessity. In a series of public presentations about her work that she gave to American audiences during a 1934-35 tour of universities, theaters, and social clubs, published as <i>Lectures in America,</i> Stein performs a delicate tightrope act, presenting her new relationship to "the outside" as both "very interesting" and "quite exciting" <i>and</i> as "queer," "perplexing," and "bothersome" (<i>LA,</i> 205; also <i>N,</i> 51, 53). An outside audience may pave the way to external recognition, bringing fame, riches and public approbation, but also preclude "the recognition of the thing that was to be existing as my writing as it was being written." As she writes about <i>The Autobiography,</i> "When the success began . . . I got lost completely lost."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How could Stein retain her cherished sense of "genius" without losing this equally desired audience? Initially, as in an early public lecture like "Composition as Explanation" , Stein attempted to blend experimental with "explanatory" techniques, appealing to the audience in much the same spirit with which she approached her more marginal coterie of readers during the first two decades of her writing. In "Composition," Stein employs her signature devices of repetition, the continuous present, and referential ambiguity as a way of getting her audience to listen "actively." She further plays with the genre of "explanation" through an insistent interrogation of the coherent authorial voice, as well as through assertions that parody argumentative logic: "By this I mean all this"; "After all this, there is that."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The deconstructive techniques of "Composition" are also evident, though less insistently, in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and <i>Lectures in America;</i> in both of these texts from the early to mid-1930s Stein retains certain aspects of textual experimentalism (repetition, referential ambiguity) while also attempting to explain her compositional techniques and principles, and thus draw readers to her other, more "purely" experimental texts. Her 1937 <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> stands as the culmination of this effort, overtly appealing to her audience as a collective group of geniuses by turning Stein's story into the story of "everybody." Yet this text, one of Stein's least experimental, also registers a sense of disillusionment with the idea of audience that speaks to Stein's increasing recognition of her celebrity and its price. An especially poignant and memorable passage in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> describes Stein's arrival in Times Square:

<p class="noIndent">
One can already glimpse similar signs of self-alienation in <i>Lectures,</i> when she makes a distinction between the "inside" audience (the genius-writer watching herself write, "at the same time talking and listening") and the "outside" audience (the audience demanding that the writer perform, "listening" but not, in turn, "talking"); one recalls Stein's comment that "if the same person does the talking and the listening why so much the better" (<i>LA,</i> 170). What troubles Stein most is the potentiality of this "outside" audience to pollute the "inside" audience, disrupting the very possibility of "talking and listening" ("hitherto I had always had nothing but what was inside me while I was writing . . . but now I suddenly began, to feel the outside inside and the inside outside") (<i>LA,</i> 205). By turning Gertrude Stein into a celebrity, "the outside" makes Stein an outsider to herself. 
</p>

<p>
The increasingly alienating pressures of this new "outside" on Stein over the course of the 1930s help illuminate the central difference between the Hugnet and the P&#x000E9;tain translation projects: the strong sense one gets from reading the latter of foreboding, unease, even coercion. It is as though an "outside" were watching, controlling, and restricting the writer's movements, policing every word in some monstrous mutation of the audience that proved so "upsetting" to Stein in <i>Lectures</i> and in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>. When in the Hugnet project Stein struggles with the issue of an "outside" (the prior text, <i>Enfances,</i> which the translator is meant passively to mediate, as well as the personal demands of Hugnet himself that the text remain his "prior right") she emerges victorious, producing a narrative that "talks and listens" to the original without being dependent on or derivative of it. The Hugnet project seems to confirm rather than undermine Stein's genius, transforming her from a passive listener (the "invisible translator") into an active talker. Some ten years later, the P&#x000E9;tain translations, by contrast, seem marked by a kind of coerced attention, by a compliance on the level of the sign itself. The English text attempts to render the French original through a one-to-one correspondence between signs. Fidelity to the word trumps any linguistic difference that might emerge from syntax or grammar. If what Stein resisted with <i>Enfances</i> were precisely the demands of "fidelity" to the original, then her absolute fidelity to the words of P&#x000E9;tain seems to undermine the theory of genius&#x02014;of "writing as it is being written"&#x02014;that emerged from the Hugnet project.
</p>

<p>
Nor is there any sense in which the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations is effecting what Walter Benjamin would call a "foreignization" of textual process. In "The Task of the Translator" , Benjamin suggests that only the "literal" translation can capture the "literariness" of the original text, allowing both original and translation to emerge in their distinctiveness: "A real translation is transparent; it does not cover the original, does not black its light, but allows the pure language, as though reinforced by 

<b></b>

its own medium to shine upon the original all the more fully. This may be achieved, above all, by a literal rendering of the syntax which proves words rather than sentences to be the primary element of the translator."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> Benjamin ends with a suggestive comparison: "For if the sentence is the wall before the language of the original, literalness is the arcade."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Arcades, the subject of Benjamin's unfinished magnum opus <i>Passagenwerk</i>, are highly associative: commercial passageways that connect two streets together, arcades embody the "anticipation and imaginative expression of a new world";<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  they are sites of fantasy and possibility that link rather than separate. Although Benjamin also emphasizes the arcade's association with consumption, his reference to the arcade in "The Task of the Translator" is clearly favorable: the arcade, like the literal translation, offers a mode of access to the other (street or language), a means of relation that does not "black" the other (as would a wall or an edifice or a sentence, with its commitment to fixed "meaning") but allows the other to be approached in fragmentary glimpses at the end of a transparent corridor. In linguistic terms, the literal translation enables the original text to be present as both "other" (fragmentary, disjointed, elusive) and as "kin," "so that it gives voice to the <i>intentio</i> of the original not as reproduction but as harmony."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Benjamin's theory of translation here seems particularly appropriate to the exigencies of modernist writing, with its severing of word and reference, its intergeneric and interlinguistic disruptions, and its differential play.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  It is akin to Stein's idea of translation as "reflection," or to Hugnet's reference to translation as "collaboration."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations seems to emerge out of a different sort of collaboration: not a dialogue between equals but a collaboration undertaken under coercion, such as that practiced by an occupied country during war (the collaboration "between a boot and a bottom," as Philippe Burrin writes).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Just as the Paris of the arcades, the capital of the nineteenth century, would become a very different city under the Vichy regime&#x02014;something Benjamin's fragmentary and apocalyptic <i>Passagenwerk</i> seems to foreshadow&#x02014;so too do Stein's translations of Philippe P&#x000E9;tain's speeches seem of a different order from her own 1930 translation of <i>Enfances</i>. In fact, the literalism of Stein's P&#x000E9;tain translations is neither foreignizing nor disruptive but extraordinarily <i>submissive:</i> a compositional quality also to be found in other strange texts of Stein's from the period&#x02014;<i>Ida</i> (1937-40), with its aborted prophecies; <i>Mrs. Reynolds</i> (1940-42), with its portrait of perversion and megalomania based on Hitler and Stalin; the eerie play trilogy "In a Garden," "Look and Long," and "Three Sisters Who Are Not Sisters" , where misidentifications lead inevitably to death. These are texts whose thematic exploration of passivity in the face of unexpected and arbitrary violence is echoed in a textual passivity characterized by equivocation, doubt, and obsessional repetition. Stein's compositional submissiveness is especially apparent in the P&#x000E9;tain project. Rather than the expression of a subtle and highly theorized understanding of translation as difference from and reconciliation with the other, the literalism of the P&#x000E9;tain translations seems to emerge from a subject in thrall to the aura of a great man: the savior on a white horse, as Stein describes P&#x000E9;tain in her introduction. Here, as in her infamous 1940 paean to Vichy defeat, "The Winner Loses," as 

<b></b>

well as in her 1942-45 <i>Wars I Have Seen,</i> Stein's pro-P&#x000E9;tainism has a mesmerized and spellbound quality about it. It is as though&#x02014;to invoke Susan Sontag's famous characterization of fascism&#x02014;the subversive writer has become a "fixated" or "fascinated" subject.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Late in the war, in an interview with a local paper, Stein talks about "her hero," about "the importance of his words and the significance of the symbol," setting up P&#x000E9;tain in a relationship of dominance toward a submissive populace.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  As Van Dusen points out, Stein's representation of P&#x000E9;tain in her introduction to the translated speeches is fetishistic, erotically and politically charged with the desire of the defeated for mastery, heroism, and "national redemption" in the wake of the German occupation. The literal adherence to P&#x000E9;tain's words in the translations themselves could be seen as a further expression of this masochistic-fetishistic desire.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting in this respect that Stein had already, in the 1930s, framed the issue of audience in terms of sadomasochism, noting that an audience "destroys the physical something that a writer is while he is writing," (<i>N,</i> 56) and that "Sadism is no connecting link but . . . sadism cannot live alone."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The sadist's gaze renders the "physical something" of the genius "talking and listening" to herself into "nothing," a submissive mouthpiece, passively ventriloquizing the audience's needs without any "connecting link." We are reminded here of the randomness of Stein's choice of speeches to translate, as well as the erasure of any editorial voice in the translations themselves, as though the translator were not a connecting link between two languages but entirely invisible. Still, "sadism cannot live alone," without its masochistic counterpart: hence Stein the translator masochistically "chooses" to submit to P&#x000E9;tain, taking up a contractual role that effectively renders impossible the kind of intertextual dialogue attempted in the Hugnet translation project. The erotics and limits of this choice can be seen again in <i>Lectures in America,</i> when Stein res the act of writing with an audience in mind as "perhaps too exciting." For of crucial importance in this discussion of sadomasochism is the sense that any submission to an audience, to an "outside," also encompasses a loss. Whatever desire Stein might have for fame and celebrity exists irreconciliably with the demands of genius; the audience that she craves, the "outside" that she hopes to please, is the same force that denies the very possibility of "talking and listening" by objectifying, hypostatizing, and hence enslaving the writer.

The juxtaposition of the Hugnet and the P&#x000E9;tain translation projects offers insight into the trajectory of Stein's aesthetic over the course of the 1930s, and helps to explain why the later translation project took the shape it did. Yet we cannot finally discuss the P&#x000E9;tain translation project without attention to Stein's politics and the role they played in its conception. If the 1930s was for Stein marked by a series of shifts&#x02014;from literary experimentalism to audience writing, from marginal expatriate to American icon, from "genius" to "celebrity" &#x02014;it was also marked by an ever-hardening political conservatism. From her dislike of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal to her distrust of the Third Republic in France to her "joking" nomination of Adolf Hitler for 

<b></b>

the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934, Stein throughout the 1930s exhibited an allegiance to the Right that was for some of her friends simply an extension of her lifelong "rentier mentality."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Her support for P&#x000E9;tain would reveal itself most overtly in "The Winner Loses" , where Stein, going beyond the conventional French platitudes about P&#x000E9;tain's Armistice as a force of neutrality and healing, praises the hero of Verdun for compelling the citizenry to abandon "the weak vices that they were all indulging in."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Three years earlier, in her correspondence of 1937, she was stating that a dictatorship was "natural": "the majority does want a dictator, it is natural that a majority if it has come to be made up of enormous numbers do, a big mass likes to be shoved as a whole because it feels it moves and they cannot possibly feel that they move themselves as little masses can, there you are, like it or not."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  From this it seems a minor step to describe P&#x000E9;tain, as she does in the introduction to his speeches, as having "achieved a miracle" with the Armistice.
</p>

<p>
Such comments were not unusual for their day: the idea of "big masses" as a "mobocracy"&#x02014;self-deluded and easily manipulable by elites&#x02014;resonates with a long tradition of nineteenth- and twentieth-century critique from Gustave Le Bon to Vilfredo Pareto to Hitler himself. Indeed, Stein's effort in 1937 to undercut liberal democratic and populist platitudes about majority rule does not differ radically from certain passages in <i>Mein Kampf</i>. At the very least, and seen in light of the rest of Stein's "political" pronouncements from the 1930s, her thoughts on the masses appear inseparable from a deep-seated recognition of the power and, arguably, the rightness of authoritarian leadership. This, too, could be seen as in part an outgrowth of her experience as a celebrity over the course of the 1930s. However self-alienating celebrity may have been for Stein in a creative sense, it also seemed to convince her of the power of her authorial voice within the context of a public. "In America everybody is [a celebrity] but some are more than others. I was more than others," Stein announces in <i>Everybody's Autobiography,</i> a text that both affirms and questions her difference from "everybody."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  It is everybody who "makes" a celebrity&#x02014;bringing "the outside inside and the inside outside"&#x02014;but once made, it is the celebrity who, like the genius, guides, instructs, and in turn "saves" everybody. So with P&#x000E9;tain at the Armistice: "And so we in France having seen France governed . . . I must say little by little the most critical and the most violent of us have come gradually to do what the Mar&#x000E9;chal asks all french people to do, to have faith in him and in the fact that France will live."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although Stein consistently renders P&#x000E9;tain's authoritarian regime as both preordained and unquestioned, there were important if subtle differences in the ways people responded to Vichy&#x02014;from conditional cooperation to <i>attentiste</i> accommodation to outright collaboration.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In fact Stein's willingness to lend textual support to P&#x000E9;tain when many other writers in France at the time were choosing simply to be silent throws her actions into stark relief. Her decision to promote P&#x000E9;tain's speeches to a presumably hostile American audience also represents a degree of ideological commitment to authoritarian rule that seems na&#x000EF;ve or blind at best, pernicious at worst. As Alice Kaplan has written of the French writer and collaborator Robert Brasillach, "Language is at stake . . . the capacity of language to do real evil."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Promoting P&#x000E9;tain's 

<b></b>

language in the translation project, Stein is also by definition promoting the consequences of this language "to do real evil" in the lives of many who experienced the effects of P&#x000E9;tain's decrees. This is by no means a neutral point, especially for interpreters of Stein's writing who attempt to suture it to a progressive politics. Many Stein critics, myself included, have stressed the capacity of her language to do real <i>good</i> as it dismantles traditional (authoritarian and/or patriarchal) structures of syntax and meaning. Stein herself, of course, furthered this assessment in her own analytical statements about "twentieth-century writing" (in <i>Lectures in America</i>), as in her core aesthetic principle of "talking and listening" as a mode of dialogic, non-hierarchical textual engagement. Yet the convergence of Stein's commitment to an oppositional or liberatory poetics with her allegiance to a politics of illiberal reaction represents yet another variation on an increasingly familiar story in modernist studies. Like Pound, Lewis, Yeats, and many other writers of her day, Stein arguably saw in dictatorial authoritarianism and its fascist permutations both aesthetic promise and a necessary "correction" of perceived social ills.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  What remains difficult about Stein's case is the fact that P&#x000E9;tain's corrective course was directed, in the name of an integral France, against individuals like herself: Jews, "foreigners," homosexuals. However much Stein may have seen herself as an exception&#x02014;and here again her sense of herself as a genius may have trumped other identifications&#x02014;it seems remarkable that she would overtly, deliberately, seemingly voluntarily promote a language, and a politics, that would "do real evil" in the lives of fellow Jews, foreigners, and homosexuals.
</p>

<p>
As I have suggested in this essay, however, a close reading of the P&#x000E9;tain translations that focuses upon their rigid literalism highlights Stein's grudging rather than fervent commitment to the Vichy program (the hyperbolic writings of Kaplan's Brasillach provide an instructive contrast with Stein in this instance). As with Stein's other writings of the World War II period, the P&#x000E9;tain translations display on their very surface the marks of reluctance and uncertainty. If, indeed, Stein is to be deemed a "collaborator," it is equally important to acknowledge her probable awareness of the price to be paid for "listening" to the other without talking back, for submitting to the Vichy regime without challenging its "prior right." Such an awareness, as we have seen, pervades the earlier Hugnet project. Having chosen to collaborate through translating P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, Stein seems to encrypt her translations themselves with the deadening implications of this "choice." Their distance from the deconstructive, playful textuality of the Hugnet "translations" is telling, suggesting that a textual compromise has been struggled with and masochistically yielded to, rather than resolved.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the P&#x000E9;tain translations present a writer pulled apart by warring forces. Stein's politics and her fetishization of P&#x000E9;tain make her willing to "submit" to his discourse in a way that seems antithetical to her sense of herself as a genius, as well as to her dialogic principle of talking and listening. Yet Stein had already shown herself to be seduced by the sadism of "the outside" several years before the P&#x000E9;tain project, in <i>Lectures in America</i> and <i>Everybody's Autobiography;</i> the P&#x000E9;tain translations suggest a heightened level of attentiveness to this outside, as though the whole generative tension of the 1930s between the writer and her audience had culminated in a discourse 

<b></b>

that for the first time in Stein's career might justifiably be called "automatic writing." The ethics of Stein's support for Vichy is ultimately inseparable from this masochism toward the discourse of the other. It is as though, faced for the first time in her life with a charged context in which language can truly do evil or do good, Stein passively delivered her authority, and her voice, to "the outside."
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, another more obvious twist to Stein's collaborative activities, as to the form in which the P&#x000E9;tain translations appear. For in the game of inside/outside, everything depends upon perspective. What Stein may have perceived as "the outside" never saw itself as an outside: P&#x000E9;tain and his Vichyites were consummate <i>insiders</i>&#x02014;politically, ideologically, and&#x02014;the fiction of the Unoccupied Zone notwithstanding&#x02014;geographically within the borders of the Nazi regime. The real outsiders for Vichy, again, were the scapegoats who represented all that France was not: in particular, the objectified, hypostatized, essentialized "Jew" whose "type" was now hypervisible to the culture at large. It was, after all, P&#x000E9;tain's infamous decree of October 3, 1940 (the first "Statut des Juifs") that for the first time in French history defined "the Jew" as a discrete legal entity who could be barred from occupying public and professional posts.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  As Michael Curtis reveals, this decree became the model for subsequent German anti-Semitic legislation in France: remarkably, "not only can Vichy claim priority in formulating a definition [of 'the Jew'], but also its formula was more extreme and harsher than the German."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The 1940 Vichy Statut, overtly discussed in the speech of October 9 that Stein translated, foreshadows the moment in 1942, while Stein was still hard at work on her translations, at which the "foreign Jew" in particular would be scapegoated in France.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Political and aesthetic questions aside, was being interpellated as a "Jew" the central factor behind Stein's decision to take on the P&#x000E9;tain translation project?
</p>

<p>
As a "Jew" Stein was clearly vulnerable in a way that other supporters of P&#x000E9;tain were not. Like the French Jewish intellectual Emmanuel Berl, who edited two of the very same speeches of P&#x000E9;tain's that Stein subsequently translated (and who coined the famous P&#x000E9;tainist phrase used to bolster French xenophobia, "La terre, elle, ne ment pas" [The earth does not lie]), Stein occupied the position of what Patrick Modiano has called the "good Jew."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  This was a deeply insecure position at best. If, as Michael Marrus and Robert Paxton suggest, Vichy "measured exemptions [for Jews] out with an eyedropper,"<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  there was no guarantee that the celebrated genius Gertrude Stein would be spared. In fact, Stein's ability to survive the war has generally been attributed not to the propaganda she wrote but more to her close friendship with an important Vichy official, Bernard Fa&#x000FF;. Yet as I argue elsewhere, it is clear both from this official's own double-dealing and from the increasingly precarious situation for Jews in France from 1942 on that Stein was by no means immune from persecution.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Even in hindsight, with our continued tendency to make easy and clear-cut distinctions between "collaborators" and "resisters," it is not hard to perceive the delicacy of Stein's situation. "Listening" to P&#x000E9;tain's speeches, recognizing herself as an outsider to her adopted country, to her hero, and to her genius, Stein may well have decided to undertake the P&#x000E9;tain translation project largely as an insurance policy to guarantee her and Toklas's 

<b></b>

survival. And to this extent, Stein's voice in the translations could be seen as that of a petrified subject, of a Scheherazade, writing as literally and hence as faithfully as possible in order to save her own life.

Most Stein biographies make some mention of the P&#x000E9;tain translation project, including Richard Bridgman, <i>Gertrude Stein in Pieces</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970), 317-8, and Linda Wagner-Martin, "<i>Favored Strangers": Gertrude Stein and Her Family</i> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1995), 246-7.

Janet Malcolm's 2003 <i>New Yorker</i> expos&#x000E9;, "Gertrude Stein's War: The Years in Occupied France," has generated a good deal of attention among general readers and scholars, in large part due to its scandalized tone. Touching briefly on Stein's P&#x000E9;tain translation project, Malcolm paints a largely one-sided and unflattering portrait of Stein as a childish, narcissistic, politically na&#x000EF;ve aesthete and "snob." With her reliance on the work of Burns and Dydo for her conclusions, Malcolm adds little that is new to the story of Stein's collaborative activities and of her experience under the Vichy regime.

This is not to deny the degree to which "fascist ideology" in its many forms&#x02014;German, Italian, French&#x02014;framed itself in terms of intellectual and artistic "iconoclasm." In France, for example, fascist intellectuals from both Right and Left explicitly positioned themselves against the "bourgeois decadence" of the Third Republic and argued for a wholesale restructuring of society. Their critiques often mobilized the techniques and representational modes of modernist aesthetics. See Robert Soucy, "Drieu la Rochelle and Modernist Anti-Modernism in French Fascism," <i>MLN</i> 95 : 922-37; also Peter Fritzsche, "Nazi Modern,"  3, no. 1 (January 1996): 1-21. Nevertheless, our contemporary understanding of the high modernist artist as a genius-re far removed from ideological tendencies or constraints seems to preclude the issue of political engagement, despite the well-known fascist leanings of many modernists (including, in the Anglo-American canon alone, Pound, Eliot, Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and Wyndham Lewis).

See John Whittier-Ferguson, "Stein in Time: History, Manuscripts, and Memory,"  6, no. 1 : 115-51. Whittier-Ferguson challenges Van Dusen's reading of Stein's introduction as straightforwardly P&#x000E9;tainist, citing Stein's "complicated and peculiar" rendering of time and character in this piece, and aligning it politically with the much more critical wartime novel <i>Mrs. Reynolds</i>. Yet one could just as easily link Stein's portrayal in the introduction of Marshal P&#x000E9;tain to her enthusiastic portrayals of generals Ulysses Grant and George Washington in the 1932 text <i>Four in America</i>. Whittier-Ferguson fails to mention that Stein's famous description of P&#x000E9;tain in the introduction&#x02014;"first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen"&#x02014;is taken directly from the "George Washington" chapter of <i>Four in America,</i> which itself borrows verbatim from General Henry Lee's famous <i>Funeral Oration on the Death of George Washington</i> . Far from being a "clich&#x000E9;," as Whittier-Ferguson argues, this phrase has deep historical resonance for Stein, who prided herself on her knowledge of and embeddedness in American history. As the contemporaneous prose text "The Winner Loses, A Picture of Occupied France"  makes clear, Stein indeed felt that P&#x000E9;tain would perform a George Washington-style liberation of the "true" France from its decadent Third Republic foes.

Haas (Los Angeles: Black Sparrow Press, 1974), 113-32.

It is important to note that P&#x000E9;tain often collaborated with others on the composition of his speeches, including Emmanuel Berl, Gaston Bergery, Henri Massis, and Henri du Moulin de Labarth&#x000E8;te. Yet the latter states in <i>Le Temps des illusions&#x02014;Souvenirs, juillet 1940-avril 1942</i> (Gen&#x000E8;ve: A l'enseigne du Cheval Ail&#x000E9;, 1946) that P&#x000E9;tain "retained the final word on the presentation of his text. . . . He pruned, with great cuts of his scissors, pieces and morsels [of text]. Then he repaired them . . . giving to the whole the direct and sober style that was his own. . . . The Mar&#x000E9;chal consecrated excessive time to these messages. He sanded them, corrected them, polished them indefinitely, assuring himself, with the dictionary, of the precise sense of each word" (159-60).

In another modernist gesture, Benjamin insistently moves in this essay toward an "ideal of pure meaning" that lies at the limit of all translations. For more on this aspect of Benjamin's essay, see John Sallis, <i>On Translation</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002). Sallis deftly shows how Benjamin's critique of "the classical determination of translation" as "restitution of meaning" reemerges "at the limit, as an ideal . . . a pure language in which there remains only the expressionless word" .

The Statut des Juifs of 3 October 1940 defined "Jews" as individuals having three grandparents of the "Jewish race," and established their right or denial of access to certain professions. "Jews" were excluded "from political office, judicial appointments, diplomatic and prefectorial posts, and the senior branches of public services. They could not be officers or heads of enterprises in which the state was involved. They could not be managers or directors in the press, radio, cinema or theater." A second Statut des Juifs of 2 June 1941 further specified the meaning of "race" to assert that "Jews were now those people who, <i>irrespective of religion,</i> had at least three grandparents of Jewish race." Bizarre exceptions were made: for example, "If an individual abandoned the Jewish religion, that person could claim to be non-Jewish if the abandonment occurred before 25 June 1940 and if the person had only two grandparents of 'Jewish race.'"

The "foreign Jew," a much-discussed notion among Vichy administrators, was both a demographic term, referring to the large number of Jewish refugees who entered France beginning in 

<b></b>

1933, and an abstract idea of "undesirability" that was often (although increasingly less so as the war went on) opposed to the "desirable" French-born Jew. Emmanuel Berl, a Jewish supporter of P&#x000E9;tain, worked to underscore this distinction in 1938 when he wrote of "the impossibility for France to let her country and her capital be invaded by the undesirables of every land." Berl quoted in Michael R. Marrus and Robert O. Paxton, <i>Vichy France and the Jews</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 43. While Stein was certainly a foreign Jew, she did not exactly fall into the category as defined by Vichy. Moreover, her visibility as a famous American may have offered her some immunity from persecution, but by all accounts, according to Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, this visibility was not enough to save her life. See Bard, <i>Forgotten Victims: The Abandonment of Americans in Hitler's Camps</i> (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1994). Stein herself notes in <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> that she and Toklas were warned in 1943 by the sous-prefet of the region to flee to Switzerland or risk being put in a concentration camp.

Stein's Vichy protector, Bernard Fa&#x000FF;, had been a member of Stein's circle of young male admirers in the 1920s and was, with Georges Hugnet, Stein's principal French translator, translating sections from <i>The Making of Americans</i> and <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> into French. Unlike Hugnet and many others, however, Fa&#x000FF; never fell out of Stein's favor, and during the 1930s he emerged as a key facilitator for many of Stein's public appearances, including her lecture tour in America. During the war, Fa&#x000FF; was chosen by his close friend Philippe P&#x000E9;tain to become director of the Biblioth&#x000E8;que Nationale; he was also secretly charged with the investigation and deportation of French Freemasons, for which he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1946. Among the charges leveled at Fa&#x000FF; in his 1946 trial were his denunciation of suspected communists and Freemasons on his staff at the Biblioth&#x000E8;que Nationale and the acceptance of a bribe in return for "protection" of a Jewish friend during the early years of the war. His trial transcript also reveals that Fa&#x000FF; was a Gestapo agent.

Narrative does not show, does not imitate; the passion which may excite us in reading a novel is not that of a "vision" (in actual fact, we do not "see" anything). Rather it is that of meaning, that of a higher order of relation which also has its emotions, its hopes, its dangers, its triumphs. "What takes place" in a narrative is from the referential (reality) point of view literally <i>nothing;</i> "what happens" is language alone, the adventure of language, the unceasing celebration of its coming.

In her review essay in the 1996 special issue of <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i> dedicated to Gertrude Stein, Lisa Ruddick discusses the shortcomings of the "French Feminist" readings of Stein which came to dominate the 1980s. Ruddick argues that such readings "now look . . . utopian, in both the good and the bad senses of the term," because of the degree to which they depended upon ahistorical theorizing about language and <i>jouissance</i>.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In light of this limitation, Ruddick's essay addresses three works that "situate Stein's experimental writing within various larger cultural fields."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  I would argue that the above comments by Stein, Roland Barthes, and Theodor Adorno help us to do something similar with respect to <i>Four Saints in Three Acts,</i> the opera Stein wrote with composer Virgil Thomson. By considering the abstract notions of narrative and lyric, as well as the ideological implications of operatic form, we can better understand this opera's position in the history of its genre and, hence, reevaluate just what kinds of cultural work it might be doing.
</p>

<p>
Setting aside for the moment the familiar hermeticism that haunts Barthes's comment, the sense of discovery he finds in narrative clearly echoes Stein's. For Barthes, the project of narrative language is not one of representation, it is not a matter of some kind of mimesis based upon the referentiality of such textual elements as scene, character, or even plot (though this gets closer to the issue). The act of narration is not a tableau, but gains its energy from structural relations within language itself. The drama is within the text, at the level of the language. This suggests that the drama of the narrative is fundamentally temporal. That is, the text gains its energy and its drama not by its allusive or other referential properties, but by the way language itself consists of these particular words in this particular order. Thus, the prospect of narrative is that of a quest located within language, a persistent and perpetual deferral of language's closure upon itself. Whereas Barthes thus describes the condition of all narrative as that of discovery within language, Stein reserves such a notion as praise for that language which is sufficiently conscious of its own form. It is in this sense that Stein moves away from the narrative prospect of telling stories in her language, and toward the meaningfulness of form more closely associated with lyric.
</p>

<p>
Stein's concern with retaining this sense of discovery within the form of language instead of its content is precisely what makes her opera <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> an unexpectedly apt demonstration of the sense of contradiction insisted upon by Adorno. In <i>Four Saints in Three Acts,</i> Stein's libretto and Thomson's music each take to heart the contradictions inherent in the project of opera. Since the genre's rise out of the debates of the Florentine <i>cameratas,</i> the defining contradiction at the heart of opera has been that between lyric and narrative, music and language. <i>Four Saints</i> is an opera that is exceedingly aware of itself and its place within this operatic tradition, and it reiterates and recalls this history in its own formal qualities. By dwelling in these contradictions instead of glossing them over, <i>Four Saints</i> presents the listener-reader (for it seems fundamental to be both with this text), with an operatic experience intent on dismantling the aesthetic idealism of Wagner and his heirs, thereby articulating quite different visions of art, society, and politics.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The proximity of lyric and narrative in <i>Four Saints</i> becomes evident in Stein's discussions of the opera. While treating an ostensibly lyrical project, we find her profoundly concerned with questions of temporality, representation, and drama in a way that very much resonates with her comments on these issues with respect to narrative. In her essay, "Plays," Stein articulates her theory of drama, periodically making reference to her own work, in particular to <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i>, "an opera to be sung." In this essay, Stein famously defines the opera as a landscape, suggesting that the ideal of drama is a spatialized stasis that would overcome narrative teleology. In fact, Stein describes the experience of theater as that of "nervousness" caused by a kind of syncopation between the time of the events of the drama as performed on stage and the time of the audience's reception of those events. Stein observes, "your emotion concerning that play is always either behind or ahead of the play at which you are looking and to which you are listening. So your emotion as a member of the audience is never going on at the same time as the action of the play."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Recalling her own first experiences of drama, she goes on to say that "the different tempo there is in the play and in yourself and your emotion in having the play go on in front of you . . . the thing seen and the emotion did not go together" ("P," 244-5). Stein discusses this temporal disparity and the resulting affective structure by way of the distance between the audience and the actors, the physical separation established by the curtain, and so on. For Stein, these matters of physical separation structure the kind of temporal disparity that characterizes the work's performance. The net result of all of this is the sense of nervousness in the audience, "and nervousness is the certain proof that the emotion of the one seeing and the emotion of the thing seen do not progress together . . . Nervousness consists in needing to go faster or to go slower so as to get it together" ("P," 245). Ultimately for Stein, this nervousness marks the distinction between the "excitement in real life and excitement on stage," with the former resulting in "culmination" and the latter in "relief."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Stein judges her own opera a success apparently because she sees it alleviating this sense of nervousness amongst the audience members. At one point in the essay, Stein seems to praise the opera for its ability to stand still, to be an atemporal field in which the audience could comfortably reside alongside these attendant saints. As she says,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In <i>Four Saints</i> I made the Saints the landscape. All the things that I made and I made a number of them because after all a great many pieces of things are in a landscape all of these saints together made my landscape. These attendant saints were the landscape and it the play really is a landscape. . . . A landscape does not move nothing really moves in a landscape but things are there, and I put into the play the things that were there.

<p class="noIndent">
Stein clearly has her relationship to cubism in mind here. In this sense, <i>Four Saints</i> is understood as a kind of cubist landscape. In fact, many critics have simply cited this passage as defining the opera's relation to temporality and gone on to explore the opera as the achievement of a nonnarrative, atemporal ideal, a drama that does not move. Stein's discussion of drama is not so simple, however, and we would do well to 

<b></b>

keep her insistence on "discovery" in mind when we consider her assertions about landscapes. Stein concludes the essay with another discussion of <i>Four Saints</i>. Here she observes, "Anyway I did write <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> an Opera to be Sung and I think it did almost what I wanted, it made a landscape and the movement in it was like a movement in and out with which anybody looking on can keep in time" ("P," 269). In this passage, Stein still judges the opera a success for its ability to overcome the sense of nervousness caused by drama's usual temporal disparity. However, she here argues that she achieved this sense of "relief" not by somehow holding the opera still, as seems to be the case in the previous comment. Rather, the proposed success of the play here depends upon its articulation of a kind of rhythmic, telescopic action with which the audience can easily keep up. She concludes her comments on <i>Four Saints:</i> "the play as I see it is exciting and it moves but it also stays and that is as I said in the beginning might be what a play should do" ("P," 269). For Stein, the success of the play depends upon its ability to elicit an affective attachment with the audience by way of its articulation of the competing demands of fixity and movement.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that this apparent paradox at the heart of Stein's discussion of drama is a productive aporia that lies at the center of <i>Four Saints</i>. The competing ideals she expresses are not simply moments of characteristic obliqueness, nor is it simply the case that the opera is gauged a <i>relative</i> success, as if it were judged on a kind of continuum from nervous syncopation to peaceful and timeless harmony. Rather, the temporal paradox in Stein's discussion of drama is productive of the opera as a whole. The opera exists, both in its libretto and its score, as a process of articulating these two competing modes. It simultaneously maintains competing drives toward timelessness and toward the temporal progression that is inevitably a part of both music and language. That is, in its degree of remove from the demands of referentiality, the opera becomes concerned above all with the prospects and limitations of temporality. Pushing toward an ideal of landscape within the realms of music and language, the opera does not extinguish temporality, it obsesses about it.
</p>

<p>
In articulating the condition of drama by way of its relation to temporality, Stein seeks a renewal of language that can help assuage what she sees as the pointlessness of telling stories. As she says in "Plays," "everyone knows so many stories and what is the use of telling another story. What is the use of telling a story since there are so many and everybody knows so many and tells so many" ("P," 260). For Stein, the prospect of telling stories seems fundamentally dried up, not because there are no more stories, but because in spite of the mind-boggling abundance of stories in the world, none of them, as a story, is really any different from any other story. Therefore, Stein sees her drama as a place in which to explore what might remain to be told in language if this formal responsibility of telling a story were removed. As she says with respect to her play, "A Curtain Raiser," "I did this last because I wanted still more to tell what could be told if one did not tell anything" ("P," 261). Since "anything that was not a story could be a play," the project of drama is "to make a play the essence of what happened" ("P," 261). Thus, as a landscape, the opera <i>Four Saints</i> would transmit the essence of the lives of the saints, not tell a story about them. And its condition as a dramatic 

<b></b>

experience would depend not upon the conventional worries of narrative, but upon the persistent invocation and withdrawal from those very conventions. With narrative a degree of remove from the opera, the opera takes the prospect of narrative itself as its subject matter instead of its method.
</p>

<p>
By articulating itself as an opera about the possibility of telling the story about these saints, <i>Four Saints</i> confronts head-on the most basic problem of narrative. In "Lecture Three," Stein dwells on the teleology of conventional narrative trajectory. Appropriately enough, the essay bears its own interesting and apt quality of circumlocution. Or rather it does not exactly speak around the subject, but repeatedly approaches and broaches the subject. The essay's particular quality of beginning again and again seems to indicate a worry over establishing the relation to the proposed subject at hand. In the very brief opening paragraphs, Stein repeatedly announces her subject. Then, in the fourth paragraph, she pauses: "But before we begin with anything that does or does not do what it is to do what it says it would if it could do that thing let us think again of narrating anything of beginning anything of ending anything" ("LT," 339). Stein returns to this problem of writing origins later in the essay, arguing that "Beginning and ending in writing anything is always a trouble of its own and it is a great trouble to any one doing any writing" ("LT," 344). This problem of beginning is constitutive of narrative because it implies the inevitable middle and ending.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  For Stein, it is the repetition of this structure that results in stories being uninteresting, no matter how new or compelling their contents may be. In order to overcome this boredom, in <i>Four Saints</i> she presents an opera that remains at the declamatory moment of beginning. This stylistic characteristic of the opera resists the teleological weight of conventional narrative, thus also ultimately articulating the particular relation between the opera and culture.
</p>

<p>
That the prospect of narrative itself might be the concern of this opera is apparent, though little remarked upon, from its opening lines. The opera announces itself with the words: 
</p>

We will return to this prologue later when we address Thomson's music and its relationship to Stein's text. For now, the text bears scrutiny for the way that it frames the issues of lyric and narrative as they will occupy the entirety of the opera. In what Marjorie Perloff might call their referential traces, the opening lines of the prologue give a sense of the "landscape"&#x02014;from the particular adoration of St. Therese which recurs throughout the opera, to the general Christian connotations of fish. These lines also exhibit the rhythm of accumulation and substitution, as well as the punning, that are so characteristic of the opera. That said, they seem more concerned with exploring the materials of language than with telling a story. That is, even at this early stage, the libretto functions not by way of eliciting sympathetic reactions to a character, but by 

<b></b>

way of its relation to its own language. These lines are followed by a single sentence that further elaborates this process of combining sound patterns, and then we get the first of many iterations of a phrase that seems central to our understanding of the opera: "In narrative prepare for saints" (<i>FSTA,</i> 581). This can, of course, be taken several ways: as directions to the cast or admonition to the audience, or even as one of the various apparently self-reflexive moments in the opera. The characteristic undecidability of Stein's text makes each of these readings possible. Further, whichever we choose, the repetition of the line and its prominence in the opening passages of the opera leave no doubt as to the importance of narrative to the text, an importance that is then perhaps most interestingly reflected in the conspicuous absence of narrative development in the opera. The opera seems to invoke the concept of narrative only to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
When considering the temporal experience thus proposed by <i>Four Saints</i>, it seems intriguing to read these lines as literally setting the stage, as putting the reader/listener in the right mental place, the right frame of mind. That is, we are to occupy the standpoint of narrative, we are to bring narrative (and thus teleology) to mind in order to observe this opera that is other than narrative. Such a proposition seems to be sustained by another line repeated in the opera, "A Narrative to Plan an Opera" (<i>FSTA,</i> 584), as well as the instruction to "Enact End of An Act" (<i>FSTA,</i> 587). The opera is about narrative not only in the sense that it concerns the very possibility of narrating the lives of these saints, but also in that it demarcates the elements necessary to the narrative it thus proposes. In this sense, <i>Four Saints</i> might be considered a performance that announces the conditions and materials of an opera that never literally takes its place. As Brad Bucknell has argued, this insistent presentness of the opera weighs in on modernist concerns with the status of knowledge and temporality by "enact[ing] <i>now</i> the opera which will occupy some future present."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  By continuously invoking and withdrawing conventions of narrative and musical progression, the opera endlessly projects itself as a possibility. To borrow from "Composition as Explanation," it never ceases "beginning again and again."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In fact, among its many nonsequential act and scene divisions, the opera contains the instruction to "Repeat First Act," a line which is sung in Thomson's music, but a direction which is not followed. The line comes immediately after a moment in the libretto that seems to pose an unlikely ethical stance for St. Therese. The ominous hypothetical is offered, "If it were possible to kill five thousand chinamen by pressing a button would it be done," with the reply, "St. Therese not interested" (<i>FSTA,</i> 586). Falling immediately as it does before the direction to "Repeat First Act," this line seems to present not so much an ethical problem as it does a reminder of the logic, or, perhaps, the antilogic of the opera. As the conventions of linear development of plot, character, and music do not hold, neither do the teleological underpinnings of cause-and-effect reasoning. St. Therese is not unethical or callous. She occupies here a sort of miniature story to remind us, after all, that the opera is not telling a story. And, in case we don't get it, we are even told to go back to the beginning and come right back to that spot.

<p>
As an aesthetic project historically concerned with the relationship between narrative and lyric, opera in general, and particularly one with the explicit concerns and consequent style of <i>Four Saints,</i> acquires its identity precisely by the way it balances these competing modes. As Lawrence Kramer has argued, such a relation is far from the exception. Rather, the incommensurable interdependence of lyric and narrative is the rule. In <i>Music as Cultural Practice,</i> Kramer deftly illustrates the way in which even "instrumental music seeks narrative as a strategy of its deconstruction."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Adopting the terms and logic of Derrida's early essay, "Force and Signification," Kramer aligns the idealized project of lyric composition with the principles of structure, and argues for narrative as the inevitable force that interrupts and derails these ideals.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  As Kramer defines his terms, "'structure' [is] the concept of an organized totality, modeled implicitly on visual/geometric order and characterized by an interdependency of parts. 'Force,' a deliberately imprecise term, is temporal and dynamic in character and associated with value, beauty, feeling, and is graspable principally as it disrupts structure and compels change" (<i>MCP,</i> 176). Building from this dialectic, Kramer proposes the term "other-voicedness" as a way of naming the process by which lyric ideals are undone by their own desire for the effects of narrative language and their consequent recourse to narrative principles. Instead of proposing this as a self-annihilating drive in lyric, Kramer argues, by analogy, that "both force and structure can invigorate each other" (<i>MCP,</i> 177). It is not the case that narrative interruptions of lyric defeat lyric. Rather, these very interruptions are both desired by lyric and productive of lyric. As the lyric/structure teeters toward its narrative demands, it establishes the conditions of its own necessity, its own energy. Which is to say that only as lyric desires narrative does it make itself possible. Desiring the effects of narrative, lyric both undoes its proposed purity and brings itself into being. 
</p>

<p>
Such a recognition of the interdependence of narrative and lyric suggests the proximity of language and music. In doing so, it implies that we must qualify just what it means to say that music and poetry are the "arts uniquely dependent on the immediate tangible organization of time" (<i>MCP,</i> 4). Discussing the purposefully resistant and generative force of this ordering of time, Kramer argues that "the temporality of music and poetry resists the immediacy of a work just enough to intensify it, to invest it with certain forms of expectation and desire" (<i>MCP,</i> 8). For Kramer, it is the "structural rhythms" of the poem and the musical work that are responsible for their possibilities of affective attachment. This would seem to be precisely the sort of rhythm that functions in <i>Four Saints,</i> accounting for the kind of telescopic quality that Stein described in the opera. However, the opera gains its particular temporal quality not merely by alternating between lyric and narrative, but by simultaneously maintaining these incommensurable ideals. The tension between lyric and narrative in the opera, its persistent invocation and withdrawal from narrative conventions, functions not as a matter of proposition and retreat. Rather, the coexistence of narrative and lyric is the very condition out of which the opera arises. 
</p>

<p>
The primacy of this conflict is evident in the way the libretto resists narrative conventions, even at the level of grammar. Thus, the opera presents us with passages such as this, from Scene X:

And so on; they apparently settle on "ten." Opening with an ambiguous temporal concern and a rhyme, "Scene X / When," the passage proceeds through a playful moment of self-reflexivity, and then into an exercise in rhyming (though it is of course not accidental that the rhymed words indicate the subjects time, counting, and "men"). The point is that the rhyme game exists in contention with the very subject matter proposed by the scene, and is indispensable to it. The "when" that is suspended over this scene announces both the lyrical and the narrative register in which the passage will be written. As indicative of the general condition of the opera, this passage demonstrates the way in which <i>Four Saints</i> privileges neither narrative "force" nor lyrical "structure," to recall Kramer's binary. The two are, instead, incommensurable equals. With respect to the libretto, the opera presents a characteristic Stein text that is primarily interested in the play between language and its conventions, in the sense of the playful discovery that language can allow. This lends the opera what is perhaps its primary temporal quality, its persistent sense of declamation. The proposition of this opera is thus of an aesthetic experience that offers a kind of textual-musical world operating otherwise than according to our expectations of language. As such, its basic characteristic, the one that defines it from the very beginning, is that it is irreducible, that it exceeds conventions of logic, reason and language. Its particularity as an artwork is the very great degree to which it refuses to resolve the conflict between lyric and narrative.

Virgil Thomson's score for the opera echoes and develops this tension between lyric and narrative that we have so far located primarily within Stein's libretto. In <i>Virgil Thomson: His Life and Music,</i> John Cage recounts his project of systematically studying Thomson's development as a composer. Cage "decided to remake, insofar as possible, the adventure [Thomson] himself had actually experienced."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Describing the project as an "expedition" following "the general plan of beginning at the beginning and going on until [he] got to the present," Cage explores each of Thomson's works from the musicological standpoint of structure and form, as well as with respect to its materials and methods, thereby developing a broader consideration of how generally to characterize the nature of Thomson's music and thus to place him within the contemporary music of 1959 (<i>VT,</i> 117). Cage affectionately describes the opera as a "quantity of quality," and describes Thomson's "new creative method" adopted for the setting of <i>Four Saints:</i> "seated at his piano, text before him, and singing, he improvised an entire act at a time until it became clear to him that the vocal line and the harmony had taken stable form" (<i>VT,</i> 157). When he sets to analyzing the score, Cage observes that "this score stands apart from Thomson's previous Stein settings in that it defies analysis. Scholarly study of it yields nothing but statistics. These give the impression that the materials of music, in contrast to those of poetry, are becoming impoverished. There are 111 tonic-dominants, 178 scale passages, 632 sequences, 38 references to nursery tunes, and one to 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee'" (<i>VT,</i> 157). Cage concludes that "no attempt to grasp <i>Four Saints</i> will take hold of it" (<i>VT,</i> 157). As Cage's comments suggest, however, it is precisely the opera's resistance to conventions of musicological analysis that provides its particularity as a piece of music. Cage appropriately describes this particularity as being both ephemeral and comedic: "to enjoy [the opera], one must leap into the irrational world from which it sprang, the world in which the matter-of-fact and the irrational are one, where mirth and metaphysics marry to beget comedy" (<i>VT,</i> 157). Cage's description of the opera as a comedy is both perfectly apt and surprisingly nearly singular. Most critics take the opera dreadfully seriously, thereby missing at least part of the point&#x02014;what might seem obvious from such ironic details as the opera's opening with a snare drum roll and the oompah-pah of the Midwestern band shell, its purposefully simplistic phrasing and instrumentation, and its use of recitative for a libretto that defies discursivity. The opera's exploration of and investment in the tension between narrative and lyric is not one of crisis or desperation at the failure of language. Rather, as is generally the case with Stein, the opera celebrates the play available at the limits of discursivity.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Literary Modernism and Musical Aesthetics,</i> Brad Bucknell has convincingly articulated the connection between Thomson's music and Stein's language as precisely this play. Bucknell quantifies the ways in which Thomson's score reiterates Stein's linguistic experimentation, arguing that, "Thomson, basically, though not simply, begins again and again. . . . and in doing so really adopts for tonal music a Steinian technique not of the continuous present, but of what might be called continuous presentation" (<i>LMMA,</i> 196). Bucknell's recasting of Stein's "continuous present" draws attention to the insistence of the score, the way the music's form constructs its persistent immanence. As Bucknell analyzes the formal qualities of Thomson's score, he argues that 

<b></b>

both music and language work continuously to broach the temporal aspects of perception, coherence, and knowledge. Thus
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Movement and stasis can be seen as not only the method of structuring the landscape of the opera, but as part of the more crucial articulation of the relationship between knowledge and temporality which is central to Stein's work as a whole. . . . Thomson's tonality, rich in its teleological tendency, its constant emphasis on reaching, if not some ultimate symbolic goal, at least a series of provisional points of reorientation, establishes not only an ironic interaction with Stein's language which is always in some sense "about to be," but more crucially, it enacts the temporality of movement and stasis which constitutes the Steinian landscape.

As the score consists of phrases, tones, and structures that are largely simple and often eerily familiar, it constantly puts the listener on the brink of identification with the music. At the same time, this potential identification is cut short by the degree to which the phrasing denies the build-up of dramatic tension or other modes of large-scale directionality. For the listener, the resulting effect is to emphasize the experience of hearing the music of the opera in its "nowness," as Bucknell argues. That is, much as Stein's language depends upon the conventions of language as it undercuts them, so does Thomson's music gain its affect and import from the continuous process of invocation of and withdrawal from expected structures of dramatic musical development. 
</p>

<p>
Bucknell's musicological analysis details the "ironic interaction" between Stein's text and Thomson's music, locating the energy of their relationship at the tension between the teleological tendency of Thomson's music and Stein's nondiscursive text. Focusing on Thomson's tonal language, Bucknell argues that his tonal shifts "impl[y], though cannot confirm . . . the <i>course</i> of meaning which could be present if the language would play along" (<i>LMMA,</i> 199). As the music provides an apparent means of relative structure to the opera, this structure is not so much an ordering principle or organizing frame as it is " a kind of simulacrum of teleology" (<i>LMMA,</i> 215). In Bucknell's analysis, the music thus provides not just a neutral background against which Stein's text can be performed, but, much more significantly, an alternate, and in some ways contestatory, aesthetic experience, the presence of which further develops the opera's interest in temporality and knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
Bucknell develops his musicological analysis partly with respect to the prologue in a way that resonates with our present concern with the relationship between narrative and lyric. As we have seen, the prologue introduces us not only to the themes but, more importantly, to the strategies by which the opera will mean, foregrounding linguistic play at the interpenetrated limits of lyric and narrative. As Bucknell describes, Thomson's phrasing in the prologue similarly works at the edges of expectation and recognition. Analyzing Thomson's rhythmic and tonal choices, Bucknell argues that the music "adjusts itself to the language," though it simultaneously articulates an additional level of signification to the libretto. He observes that Thomson's composition bears logical and purposeful relation to Stein's language:

<b></b>

<blockquote class="extract">

Words falling on the first beat of a bar are emphasized, but against this emphasis the &#x000E6; pulse, even though it is distributed over bars of varying length, remains a strong influence here. Thomson generally places these words on the stronger beat of the bar and gives them a clear prominence in the tonality: 'know' is sung on an F, 'love' is sung on C as part of an arpeggiated descending F major chord sung in the melody, two of the first three 'saints' are sung on a C, the second occurrence falling on a G which finishes the melodic phrase that began on the fourth beat of bar 5. In bars 10, 11, and 14 the word falls on the first beat of the bar and is sung F, C, and F respectively.

<p class="noIndent">
Though there is no programmatic connection between the libretto and the music, Thomson's score conscientiously emphasizes words that seem to bear significant semantic weight. However, this apparent structural consistency between the words and the music is only part of the game in the prologue, and, in fact, the music "plays a kind of parodic dance with the language" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). As Bucknell's analysis demonstrates, the music here "both conceals and reveals the word 'fish'" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). 
</p>

<p>
As we noted earlier, <i>fish</i> in these opening lines seems to provide one of the early thematic images of this proposed saintly operatic landscape. However, our observation of the connotative significance of this term ignored its grammatical context. Any Christian associations we might make with the term seem to exist in contention with the demands of the phrase in which it repeatedly occurs, "it makes it well fish," presenting a tension between sense and nonsense. Bucknell's analysis demonstrates that Thomson's music focuses on this term and provides it with an "obscure prominence." Thomson everywhere doubles the resonance of "fish," such as when he gives it but "an eighth note's duration" and places it "at the end of a melodic phrase even though it falls on the first beat of the bar" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). Or, similarly in terms of tonal choices, when it is "sung on an A, and even though this is a relatively strong pitch in F major, it is sung over the C dominant chord which weakens its relationship to F major" (<i>LMMA,</i> 186). Thomson's play with the term both elaborates the tension evident in Stein's text and, in Bucknell's analysis, "overcomes grammatical obscurity, though it does not erase it" (<i>LMMA,</i> 186). The tension between "linguistic-moral progression" and "grammatical obscurity" functions as the "other-voicedness" which Kramer identifies at the heart of all lyric. Thomson's tonally simple, teleologically inclined music resonates with Stein's text not because it provides it with a structural overlay, but because it internalizes the contest between lyric and narrative, force and structure that so defines Stein's language. 
</p>

<p>
If Stein's language moves toward the lyric and away from the narrative by way of its explorations of syntax, grammar, and aurality, Thomson's music moves toward the narrative via its purposeful simplicity and its play upon cultural resonance. As Bucknell argues, "Thomson's very structured tonality and rhythm <i>suggest</i> the image of a syntactical and ordered progression and acceptable <i>social</i> structure. The language, on the other hand, keeps making verbal appeals and creations, assertions it does not care to prove or make clear" (<i>LMMA,</i> 202; italics in original). Daniel Albright similarly recognizes the apparent purpose of the music's simplicity and rightly describes it as a sampling of an American musical consciousness.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As Albright explains, Thomson's music 

<b></b>

consists largely of phrases lifted from the country's liturgical traditions and the local brass band. Thus, as much as the opera has a religious feel to it, this background also frequently provides it with the anachronistic sounds of the community band shell and the militaristic tones of parades and marches done in the vein of John Philip Sousa. In fact, such gestures are evident from the opera's very beginning. Thomson's music begins with an almost comically regular &#x000E6; beat in which an oompah-pah in F major alternates with one in C major. As such, the music from the beginning sounds more appropriate perhaps to the local carnival than it does to an opera about saints. Emphasizing the humor of Thomson's composition, Albright draws our attention to the way the music in these early measures takes on a kind of sly grin: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
it is harmonically galumphing: the tonic is overdetermined, overweighted, paralyzed by the dominant chords that monitor and define it. . . . Overemphasis leads to a weakening of the thing emphasized, in this case the concept of the tonic. Another oddity is the meter, which keeps shifting, so that the accent of the passage as a whole is as likely to fall on the first or the second pah as on the oom.

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
As we have seen, this "overdetermination" and "overemphasis" that Albright identifies in the opening phrases of the opera becomes the doubling that emerges with the text. What's more, as both Albright and Bucknell note, this awkward weightiness is no accident. Thomson's compositional strategy was partly a conscious process of resisting the highly intellectualized practices of musical modernism, especially those of Schoenberg. As Bucknell argues, Thomson's purposefully simple musical vocabulary in <i>Four Saints</i> "becomes the perfect foil for Stein's language in a way which more 'difficult' music might not have succeeded in becoming" (LMMA, 183). The effect of the "other-voicedness" achieved by Thomson's composition, the preponderance of "doubled acoustical images" is that the piece offers meaningful temporal progression as a topic or a problem, not as a technique. 
</p>

<p>
As Albright, Bucknell, and Cage have all noted in their own ways, Thomson's music resists conventions of dramatic musical development and intellectual sophistication even as it plays on the brink of those conventions. We might understand the meaningfulness thus achieved by Thomson's music by way of recourse to the metaphysics of music found in Victor Zuckerkandl's <i>Sound and Symbol.</i> The "continuous presentation" Bucknell demonstrates in Thomson's score strongly resonates with Zuckerkandl's recasting of our commonsense notions of music as the temporal art. Zuckerkandl meticulously quantifies the inherent directionality of music, arguing that the temporal experience of music results from neither the demarcating beats of meter nor the sonic event of musical tones as conventionally understood, but from the desire-laden "dynamic" of tones and rhythm. That is, when we hear music, we hear not simply tones and meter, but, rather, we quite literally hear time in the will to completion that is embedded as an inherent part of those tones and their rhythmic constitution.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Thus music is not temporal art in the pedestrian sense that it consists of notes taking place over a period of time, but, rather, "music is temporal art in the special sense that in it time reveals itself to experience" (SS, 200). For Zuckerkandl, what music thus teaches 

<b></b>

us about time more generally is that it is neither linear nor repetitious, but that it is always simultaneously forward-looking, anticipating the progression of the very structure which it constitutes, and recursive, perpetually throwing the listener back on what has come before. This notion of musical time seems to be emphasized in Thomson's score, with "its propensity to move by sequence or by contiguity rather than by progression" (SS, 202). As Thomson avoids the processes of counterpoint or opposition that would carry senses of intentionality, the musical phrases may be snapshots or musical vignettes, but they thus seem to have no goal. There is no drive for resolution; the opera simply stops or shifts more than it logically concludes. The listener, therefore, is presented with a musical piece that seems irreverent, caring not for its own past at the same time that it defies logical anticipation. Just as the libretto so frequently announces its debut, the music perpetually presents its own beginning. In such a circumstance, the audience is left in a persistent state of uncertain expectation, reaching for its own connections between these various musical and linguistic phrases, or, perhaps more to the point, questioning the tenability of any such connections. The listener is not so much asked to follow the story or the music as encouraged to inquire how, on what grounds and in what way, they proceed. 
</p>

<p>
This structural affinity is also evident in Thomson's use of counting. As in the passage from Scene X, the libretto frequently introduces counting apparently for the sake of counting, or as an opportunity for exploring simple aural possibilities of language. In fact, "much of Stein's text consists of strings of numbers, such as 'One two three four five six seven all good children go to heaven some are good and some are bad one two three four five six seven'" ("ONA," 597). These strings of numbers, however, do not imply direction or progress. Here, the counting seems to be a frame of rhyme and meter in which the opera plays. In a certain sense, this passage, and others like it, seem committed to the sense of counting Stein describes in "Poetry and Grammar," where she asserts, "one and one and one and one and one. That is the natural way to go on counting."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  That is, numerical order, as with narrative progression, is not the substance of meaningful, "natural" engagement with the world for Stein. As Albright observes, Thomson's score exhibits a similar strategy: "when Thomson set this to music, he simply assigned the eight syllables of 'One two three four five six seven' to a descending D-major scale. . . . the text inspires the music to enumerate its fingers, to count along with it&#x02014;but the music-counting soon gets desynchronized from the text-counting, inconspicuously, without a fuss" ("ONA," 597). Though the music slips into a kind of syncopation with the text, this shift does not bear dramatic weight because the two were not bound together in a commonly meaningful direction in the first place. The aptness of their relation is a structural or procedural one, residing at their respective explorations of their own most basic grammars. As the eight-syllable line ending in "seven" provides a simple linguistic frame of rhyme and meter, so does the use of the eight descending notes of a major scale. The libretto and the music adopt these similar frames in which to develop procedures of reduction, interestingly founding their relationship on what Zuckerkandl identifies as the musical experience of time. For Zuckerkandl, music demonstrates to us that we do not hear singular tones, we 

<b></b>

always hear a tone on its way to or from another tone. What's more, even if we hear a series of tones that are identical in pitch and intonation, we will group them, most naturally in clusters of two, three, or four (SS, 167). This counting passage from the opera seems to recognize just this inclination and to construct itself primarily around its insistent iambs, the alternating accents of which then provide a rhythmical tension with both the progress of the numbers and the descent in the music. As the semantic resonance of the passage recedes, its syntactic signification is foregrounded.
</p>

<p>
A similar sense of reduction underscores the common musical exercises that periodically recur throughout the score. Resisting the appearance of a highly refined work of art, the opera frequently presents itself as a kind of music primer. Albright describes an early example of this technique: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
when the accompaniment plays a chord in E-flat major, and Saint Teresa I obligingly sings "She is to meet her" as an ascending perfect triad in E-flat; four bars later, the accompaniment plays an E-major chord, and she sings "Very many go out" as an ascending perfect triad in E; and so on, to F and F-sharp and G. . . . it removes all sense of direction or consequence: the singer begins at a note chosen randomly, near the bottom of her range, and proceeds upward by semitones until she stops, not for any reason of music syntax, but only because her voice has run out of notes. . . . it is a semantic void: there is no expression of emotion, no subtlety of phrasing, only an attempt to instill an exact memory of pitch in the muscles of the larynx.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
At moments such as this, the opera seems to be a mere lesson for the singers. In this sense, the score also presents itself as the most basic materials upon which an opera could be constructed. That is, just as the libretto articulates the constituent elements of a possible narrative, the score projects an opera in the future tense by articulating those materials and procedures upon which any such opera would depend.
</p>

<p>
The declamatory nature of the piece, at the level of both the libretto and the music, is the very strategy by which it means. That is, this lyric's concern with narrative, the particular cohabitation of these two linguistic projects, is the way in which this opera proposes a particularly temporal meaning for itself. From its serial allusions to its self-reflexivity, this lyric reaches toward the possibilities of narrative in such a way that it tells the story of its own telling. What's more, for both Stein and Thomson the temporal experience thus achieved is very particularly American. Accordingly, the most direct allusion in the music matches perfectly with the only readily discernible direct quote in Stein's libretto, the phrase, "My Country 'Tis of Thee." The concern here is clearly not just an experience of history or temporality broadly considered, or even simply of music and language, but a specifically American experience. As such, we can consider the opera's perpetual projection of itself into the future, the way in which it endlessly leaps forward from familiar phrases, as perhaps a comment on the condition and possibility of America. Thus, the declamatory insistence enacted by the opera's form is resonant with Stein and Thomson's perceptions of early twentieth-century American culture. It is in this sense that we might understand the implications of Steven Watson's comment that, "Like Gertrude, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> was the 

<b></b>

essence of America, embodying not its anecdotes and history but its sound and structure."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This claim about the opera's national particularity was central to its composition for both Stein and Thomson. As Watson and others recount, their original intention was to write an opera about George Washington, but Thomson rejected the idea because he didn't like the lack of individuality that would be caused by all of the actors wearing eighteenth-century wigs. So, they settled on Saint Teresa of Avila. Hardly an obvious choice, but also not an arbitrary one. As Watson argues, "[Stein] repeatedly described <i>Four Saints</i> as an opera about Spain and the Spanish landscape. The opera's geography was not literal, but Spain provided Stein with a field of associations" (<i>PS,</i> 43-4). Thus Stein and Thomson set about writing an American opera with Spanish saints as its characters. Choosing such a subject for an ostensibly nationally specific opera already suggests the relationship <i>Four Saints</i> will bear to the tradition of opera. As Richard Dellamora and Daniel Fischlin have argued in <i>The Work of Opera: Genre, Nationhood, and Sexual Difference,</i> the history of opera is imbued with assertions of national pride and the invocation of nationally specific religious myths. Particularly coming to a head in the nineteenth century in res such as Verdi and Wagner, opera was from its beginnings a matter of developing synecdoches for the fate of the nation. As their introduction puts it,

<p class="noIndent">
Dellamora and Fischlin conclude that "opera produces . . . the public realm of nation, insofar as opera voices an archetypal model of what nation is" (<i>WO,</i> 3). Stein and Thomson's project of writing an American opera clearly echoes this cultural function of the genre. Stein's decision to use sixteenth-century Spanish saints, however, is fundamentally quite different from, say, Wagner's recourse to Germanic myth. As Thomson would later recall, "A Jew and a Protestant turn out a Catholic opera about Spain in the 16<sup>th</sup> century and in the course of writing that music I came into practically total recall of my Southern Baptist upbringing in Missouri."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The playfulness of tone in this passage should not be missed, nor should the notion of gathering a sense of historical identity precisely by virtue of absence. Though Thomson would return to the U.S., at the moment of composition his perspective seems to be an example of an exile's optimism. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> is an opera full of play, an opera of play, and in such an instance, the notion of a "national aesthetic," to invoke Adorno's discussion of Wagner, is presented as something other than founding the roots of the nation in myth. In this sense, the opera's relation to its own proposed national project echoes the music's relation to structural development. Both fundamentally deny the nostalgia that lies at the base of opera's historical connection with nation.
</p>

<p>
Such a divorce is never quite so easy, of course. In fact, the opera seems to bear many of the marks of Wagnerism, particularly in Stein's commentary from "Plays." 

<b></b>

That Wagner should come into the picture at this point is no accident. It is impossible to account for the general implications of nationalism in opera without confronting him. The case with this opera is even more specific, however. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> was composed between 1927 and 1929. At the time, Thomson was deeply involved with the compositional music scene of Paris, and this scene was largely defined by the specter of Wagner. Further, it is perhaps instructive to remember that Schoenberg had reached musical maturity and prominence by this point, and that he began his Wagnerian project <i>Moses und Aron</i> only a year later,in 1930, and that Thomson explicitly sought to distinguish himself from Schoenberg in his development as a young composer. 
</p>

<p>
Thomson shed the weight of the Wagnerian heritage by reaching for the legacy of Satie, particularly for his sense of humor. Nevertheless, Stein's assertion that "nothing happens" in <i>Four Saints</i> seems to resonate with the project of mythification that is so central to Wagnerian opera. If Wagner pursues national mythification partly by way of temporal stasis within the music and seamlessness between the acts, then we are inclined to wonder whether Stein's apparently atemporal ideal functions similarly. The question, then, is what elements of <i>Four Saints</i> seem to retain Wagnerian ideals, and what seems to escape their influence. First, it is important to consider precisely why such ideals need escaping in the first place. In his study <i>In Search of Wagner,</i> lamenting what he sees as the hollowness of the Wagnerian legacy, Adorno indicts the <i>Gesamtkunstwerk,</i> arguing that "the very seamlessness of the form of the music drama, the Wagnerian 'style' itself, is what is at fault. Music no longer possesses its decisive power: its ability to transcend imprisonment, in the context of an action."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  For Adorno, the "seamlessness" of Wagnerian opera extends from the unity of the arts to the musical concerns of instrumentation and tonal relation. Adorno's primary critique of Wagner is that he sought to achieve this not by finding an essential unity between the arts, but instead by forcing a kind of top-down unity under the baton of the heroic composer-conductor. As Adorno demonstrates, the ultimate goal of the image of the composer-conductor is "the occultation of production by means of the outward appearance of the product&#x02014;that is the formal law governing the works. . . . The product presents itself as self-presenting; hence too the primacy of chromaticism and the leading note" (<i>ISW,</i> 85).
</p>

<p>
This ideal of the self-producing artwork is what constitutes Wagnerian opera as fundamentally bourgeois. Adorno argues that "The conductor-composer both represents and suppresses the bourgeois individual's demand to be heard. He is the spokesman for all and so encourages an attitude of speechless obedience in all" (<i>ISW,</i> 35). As Wagnerian opera demands capitulation on behalf of the audience, the audience is only all the more pleased. As Dellamora and Fischlin put it, "<i>the work of opera</i> is to stage the pleasure of the false consciousness that is nation, to re and voice the contradictions implicit in any production of imperial order, to display the allure of the heterogeneous, the differend that will not be eradicated, the queer" (<i>WO,</i> 11; italics in original).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The pleasure of the opera is the pleasure of dissimulation, and, as such, the threat of opera as conceived under the banner of Wagnerism is that it depends upon 

<b></b>

depicting and thus containing those elements of society by which it defines itself as culture. Opera does not pretend to be realistic. Rather, in its very extravagances, both conceptual and in terms of the cost of production, opera proclaims itself as the bourgeois artwork par excellence by insisting on its ability to unify disparity in the common cause of nation. In these terms, the struggles for freedom and individuation that permeate the themes of opera are inevitably struggles between the Enlightenment notion of individual freedom and the power of myth to found community. Of course, the Wagnerian ideal of unity always decides this struggle in favor of myth, even before the struggle has begun. The importance of such opera is not to provide tales of liberation or freedom, but to celebrate the delusion of freedom born out of its own imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
This de facto judgment in favor of myth is what constitutes Wagnerian opera's relationship to time and history. As a process of bourgeois celebration, opera articulates the myth of origins. Adorno demonstrates that this ideal of timelessness has a structural correlative in Wagner's compositional techniques. He argues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The absence of any real harmonic progression becomes the phantasmagorical emblem for time standing still. . . . The standing-still of time and the complete occultation of nature by means of phantasmagoria are thus brought together in the memory of a pristine age where time is guaranteed only by the stars. Time is the all-important element of production that phantasmagoria, the mirage of eternity, obscures.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The ideal of the seamless work of art functions both at the level of the composition and in the relationship between the disciplines to present a mythical state of eternity. For Adorno, this also accounts for the sheer duration of Wagnerian opera: the degree of Wagner's success is measurable by the fact that though several hours may pass during a performance, the musical structure and thematic timelessness of the piece so deny temporal progression that they compensate for this extravagance.
</p>

<p>
It is here, at the discussion of the timeless as the ideal of art, that we might locate a disturbing if unexpected similarity between <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> and the project of Wagnerian opera. This risk is precisely why I insist on retaining Stein's more complicated notions about the temporality of drama. If, as Albright claims, "the text defies discursivity and the music defies temporal progression" to the degree that the opera is little more than a "directionless field of pleasant acoustic events," ("ONA," 574) then the opera retains the responsibility of ration and is inevitably, if unintentionally, relegated to the status of bad Wagner. In this sense, Stein's assertion that "nothing happens" in <i>Four Saints</i> approaches a pale version of the fundamental characteristics of Wagnerian opera, as Adorno has them:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The eternity of Wagnerian music . . . is one which proclaims that nothing has happened; it is a state of immutability that refutes all history by confronting it with the silence of nature. . . . Nothing is changed; and it is the dynamics of the individual parts that reinstate the amorphous primal condition.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
However, I would argue that Stein's insistence on the troubled nature of temporality in the ideal drama suggests that <i>Four Saints</i> functions quite differently. And, appropriately enough for a representative work of modernism, the difference between these perhaps apparently similar goals is evident at the level of style. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas Wagnerism strives toward timelessness by articulating the opera as a process of logically achieved artistic unity, <i>Four Saints</i> conveys the crisis at the center of just such a project. Thomson's score does not present itself as an inviolable unity; nor does it seem to bear any programmatic relation to the text at hand. Rather, what is significant about the relationship between the text and the score is precisely the very great degree to which they "acknowledge the perplexity of the problems and possibilities of their union" (<i>LMMA,</i> 222). The music does not try to lend expression to the words, as Albright notes, it "assists the text&#x02014;not by reinforcing it, not by expressing it, but by providing a pleasant and commodious <i>environment</i> in which the words can achieve their maximum intelligibility" ("ONA," 603; italics in original). This is the importance of the irony of the choice of recitative for Stein's libretto. The result of this irony, and the process of the opera as a whole, is that instead of offering itself as a perfectly integrated, autonomous object, the opera functions as a perpetual act of declamation, an unceasing process of prying open the totalizing effects of conventional musical and narrative development. This structural dimension of the opera is echoed in its thematic elements. The opera does not develop or even describe characters in scenes together. Rather, at those moments when the opera does seem concerned with a notion of scene, it provides the materials for a scene that might occur, which is why those relatively discursive moments of the opera read not like drama but like stage directions for a drama. The opera is not timeless by virtue of being directionless; rather, its resistance to conventions of directionality and development imbues it with the temporal.
</p>

<p>
All of this suggests that the opera functions as a parody of opera itself. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> invokes the conventions of particularly Wagnerian drama by way of its subject matter and its character as a nationally specific work; it invokes grammatical conventions of narrative and music. And it does so precisely to critique these conventions and explore what persists in language and music aside from such regulations. In this sense, the opera functions not so much as anti-opera (as some might have it), but as the very quintessence of opera. Inasmuch as opera is a celebration and reaffirmation of bourgeois myths of identity and unity, its greatest desire is to "confirm its own pleasure in dissimulation. The closer opera gets to parody of itself, the closer it is to its own most particular element" (<i>SF,</i> 16). For Adorno, it is this fundamental characteristic of opera which is responsible for what he sees as the crisis of modern opera: "the genre cannot dispense with illusion without surrendering itself, and yet it must do so" (<i>SF,</i> 16). This awareness of itself as dissimulation, always a fundamental component of opera, is one way to understand Schoenberg's abandonment of <i>Moses und Aron</i>. As Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe argues in <i>Musica Ficta</i>, <i>Moses und Aron</i>, a consummately Wagnerian piece in conception and intent, is ultimately paralyzed by its identity as "the offering of a work that explicitly thematizes the questions of its own possibility as 

<b></b>

a work&#x02014;modern in this way&#x02014;and that thereby carries in itself, as its most intimate subject, the question of the essence of art."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  For both Adorno and Lacoue-Labarthe, the result of <i>Moses und Aron</i>'s self-awareness is a kind of generic suicide for opera, or, at best, a sophisticated articulation in "the register of the <i>mise-en-abyme</i> and of citation" (<i>MF,</i> 120). That is, as a representative of the condition of high modernism, Schoenberg's opera drives opera to its own death by reducing it to the necessary awareness of its own nature as dissimulation.
</p>

<p>
It is not entirely clear, however, that such a recognition must necessarily result in the death of the genre. It might also be the case that opera's realization of its own identity in self-parody might be reinvigorating. As Lacoue-Labarthe demonstrates, the central reason behind Adorno's interest in Wagner and his declaration of the crisis of modern music is the degree to which Adorno retains the Wagnerian ideal of <i>musica ficta,</i> the rative ideal of music which Lacoue-Labarthe describes as "the aestheticization&#x02014;the ration&#x02014;of the political" (<i>MF,</i> xv). Invoking the primary principles of Adorno's aesthetic, Lacoue-Labarthe argues that "the possibility of a 'structural perception,' the unified (and thus totalizing) nature of music, the adequation of such a unity to the 'idea' of the text (to its metaphysical signification), the 'obligation' itself. These are all incontestably principles that come from Wagnerian aesthetics" (<i>MF,</i> 122). These are, of course, the terms in which Adorno had developed and defended the compositional developments of Schoenberg. Lacoue-Labarthe's argument, thus, is that Adorno critiques Wagner and Wagnerian ideals in Wagnerian terms. In this sense, Schoenberg's reduction of opera to the contemplation of its own possibility is the limit case of opera because there is no further development made available by the laws of bourgeois society. Having articulated its essence as bourgeois self-parody, having laid bare the paradox at the heart of its ideal as <i>musica ficta,</i> opera is made powerless by its own development.
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, another version of the tragic conception of art that underlies much discussion of modernism. In such an understanding of the development of art, the authenticity of an artwork depends upon a kind of self-annihilating critique, in which the artwork "is only itself in the impossibility of effectuating that which founds its authenticity" (<i>MF,</i> 124). Denying the ruse of origins, the modern artwork must proclaim the impossibility of its own authenticity. Inasmuch as opera retains the notion of <i>musica ficta,</i> this remains a paralyzing situation. For Adorno, this implies that "the criterion of social truth of music today is the extent to which it enters into opposition to the society from which it springs and in which it has its being&#x02014;in short, the extent to which it becomes 'critical,' however indirectly" (<i>SF,</i> 12). Music, in this context, is forever confined to the situation of secondary and critical commentary on the society out of which it comes. Thereby, of course, being critical of itself above all else. However, a similar awareness of the flawed ideal of <i>musica ficta</i> might have very different consequences for an artist or composer less committed to the Wagnerian ideal.
</p>

<p>
In Thomson and Stein, we seem to have such artists, and the defining characteristics of the opera demonstrate its distance from the problems of ral music. Accordingly, the irony of the opera's use of recitative is echoed in its other elements. Thomson's 

<b></b>

idiosyncratic compositional technique, as described by Cage, seems purposefully to defy the deification of the composer-conductor characteristic of the Wagnerian tradition. The peculiar energy of the relation between the music and the text, the purposeful lack of conventional strategies of setting text to music, is utterly at odds with the concept of unity at the heart of structural perception. And, perhaps most tellingly, Thomson's experience of regaining and employing the soundscape of his own background demonstrates the importance of personality to this opera. Above all, <i>musica ficta</i> must seek to unify the idiosyncrasies of personality in its reach toward generalizable myths of origin and community. The defining presence of nonintegrated personality, combined with the absence of the authoritarian composer-conductor, which is to say the opera's style, is one means by which this opera avoids the prescriptions of ral music. Embracing the oddities of personality, defying the conventions of <i>musica ficta,</i> and resisting the drives toward structural closure in both lyric and narrative, the opera takes its place in culture in a way quite different from the myth-making and regulatory role of Wagnerian opera.
</p>

<p>
All of which is to say that theopera presents not a Wagnerian ideal of seamlessness, functions not as a cultic object. Rather, it displays its seams, revealing and reveling in its very constructedness, thereby throwing the onus of coherence onto the audience. This resistance to the pretense of unity thus constitutes a different affective structure from that of Wagnerian opera. Instead of identifying with the myth of origin under the baton of the composer-conductor, the audience of <i>Four Saints</i> is given the responsibility of creating order. In this sense, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> seems to satisfy Adorno's hope for opera in the future. Recalling the importance of the myth of Orpheus to opera, Adorno asserts that in opera, "the audience is called upon as a witness, if not indeed as a court of appeal" (<i>SF,</i> 21). In Wagnerian opera, the success of this appeal constitutes an affirmation of the audience itself, as well as the primacy of the heroic conductor-composer. That is to say, of the ideal of unity emblematized by the opera itself. Adorno's argument suggests that for modern opera, after Wagner and after <i>Moses</i>, this appeal must take a very different form:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In the movement toward the nonideological, unpretentious method of operatic composition, we can at least demand that the subtlety and complexity of the compositional process be preserved in its entirety and the superstitious belief in origins be abandoned.

<p class="noIndent">
The degree to which Thomson's music retains Adorno's demand for "subtlety and complexity," is a matter for consideration beyond the confines of this discussion. Suffice to say that the apparent simplicity of the opera's music is not a matter of na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;, but the product of a well-trained and highly innovative musical mind exploring the possibilities of musical Americana. Of more immediate interest to our discussion is Adorno's hope that new opera abandon the superstition of origins. In this sense, the opera's parodic invocation of the ral ideal at the heart of Wagnerian opera suggests just such an escape. As such, the opera's denial of conventions of narrative or lyric development, its very thorough insistence on force over structure, throws any possibility of 

<b></b>

coherence into the future and onto the audience. With its parody of ritual and of the resulting cultic quality that historically characterized opera, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> presents itself not as a unifying gesture of materials upon which a nation might be founded, but as the celebration of the impossibility of such claims of origin.

Culmination and relief, here, might certainly be read by way of the expectation of catharsis. Also, they are ways of articulating temporal experience in life and the text. Life has culmination because it is an accrual of actual events that continues to proceed. The text, as an artwork, has no time outside itself. Completing the text, one achieves relief. In these terms, my argument with respect to this opera is that it resists the teleology that underwrites conventional drives toward relief. The opera's defining characteristic is the way in which it resists moving toward a sense of relief by way of the completion of any dramatic, structural unity, either lyrical or narrative. The result is that the time of the opera, the time in the opera, is utterly other than the sequential time that defines both narrative and traditional notions of lyric structure.

Of course, for Stein this question of beginning and middle and ending resides not just at the level of the story but also at that of grammar. Thus, the famous sentence from this essay, "I love my love with a b because she is peculiar," can be understood as a process of retaining the form of grammar while inserting words as place-holders that resist semantic expectations-a process by which Stein sought to emphasize the drama of discovery at the level of the language instead of its story. We might understand <i>Four Saints</i> as a radicalization of this process in which even the grammar and its commensurate expectations are altered. That is, <i>Four Saints</i> does not retain the grammar of opera but takes that grammar as its problem.

Though productive as a means of considering the ways in which lyric and narrative inform and depend upon one another, Kramer's discussion depends upon a too-easy binary between the two. Further, while Kramer aligns "force" with narrative's interruption of the troubling ideal of lyric unity, Derrida's essay from which Kramer draws these terms is obviously concerned with narrative as a matter of "structure." Partly, this is a matter of the localized histories of the particular disciplines, and Kramer is clearly attempting to problematize the historical ideal of lyrical unity within the tradition of musicology.

Daniel Albright, "An Opera with No Acts: 'Four Saints in Three Acts.'" <i>The Southern Review</i> 33, no. 3 : 574-605; hereafter abbreviated as "ONA." As Albright puts it, "Thomson's music is derived from the scales, triads, and snatches of hymns that constitute the racial unconsciousness of Western music" ("ONA," 592). Obviously, the implication here is that of a particular racial consciousness. Hardly universal, it is a consciousness derived from Thomson's experience and reflects his position as a Harvard-educated, white composer born in Missouri in 1896. As Barbara Webb has argued, the racial implications evident in Albright's characterization of the opera are deeply problematic. As Webb rightly points out, Thomson and Stein both made several racially essentializing comments in their correspondence when discussing the choice to cast African American singers for the opera. What's more, Webb convincingly argues that such casting at least partly accounts for the perhaps unexpected success of the opera. By casting African Americans to sing this speech which approaches "nonsense," Stein, Thomson, and Maurice Grosser, the opera's original designer, whether consciously or not, exploited the conventions of minstrelsy.

Bucknell similarly identifies the problem of race in the staging of <i>Four Saints</i>. He argues that "Thomson's music in fact makes the operatic text more socially acceptable, and . . . so too did the black cast of performers and dancers. This is, I would maintain, because they visually solidify the 'otherness' of the text&#x02014;that is, at least for the <i>white</i> viewer/listener, and indeed, for the <i>composer</i> as well. The performers take the edge off any disturbance that could be caused by the language, and in another way, by the music; they manifest it in the image of its otherness" (<i>LMMA,</i> 216).
