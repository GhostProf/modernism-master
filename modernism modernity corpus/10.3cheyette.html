<p>
At a job interview in the 1980s, the then head of the English Department
at Birmingham University opened the questions with the following remark:
"I might well be accused of being anti-Semitic, but don't you think that
writing about Jews is rather narrow?" Since the 1980s there has been,
thankfully, a sea change in our understanding of the canon of American
and European literature. For the most part, this has been an important
corrective to the largely uncritical view that existed before this
period which merely celebrated the canon as a bastion of universalizing
(presumably "non-narrow") human values. We now have a more historically
grounded and nuanced understanding of the ways in which supposedly great
literary and cultural achievements can be complicit with the worst of
human behavior.
<p>
There is nothing particularly new about this pessimistic view of western
culture. It was first articulated in the 1930s and 40s by proponents of
the Frankfurt School, especially Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and
Max Horkheimer, and was popularized for an Anglo-American readership by
George Steiner in the 1960s. As Steiner states in his <i>Language and
Silence</i> : "The ultimate of political barbarism grew from the
core of Europe. . . . This is of obvious and appalling relevance to the
study or teaching of literature. It compels us to ask whether knowledge of
the best that has been thought and said does, as Matthew Arnold asserted,
broaden and refine the resources of the human spirit."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Instead of the ideals of an Arnold or an Eliot, Benjamin's oft-quoted
dictum&#8212; "there is no document of civilization which is not at
the same time a document of barbarism"&#8212;

<b></b>

has been taken to speak for our age. One can move quite easily from
Arnold to Eliot in these terms (however much Eliot disdained Arnold)
in their respective roles as cultural arbiters who use the language of
race to underline their authority.
<p>
I have always thought that it is a mistake to overdetermine or moralize
individual writers as particularly unforgivable anti-Semites or racists
as this lets the rest of the culture off the hook. Over the years, this
approach has tended to marginalize the question of racial discourse in
literature as it is deemed to be beyond our routine concerns, a specialism
concerned only with loathsome individuals. To this extent I follow Lionel
Trilling whose critical study of Matthew Arnold was the first and is still
the best account of Arnold's use of race as a category in <i>Culture and
Anarchy.</i> In his book, Trilling writes that in Arnold's day "racial
theory . . . was almost undisputed" and he then goes on to list some
of the many examples of those who, in his words, were "to foster and
elaborate the notion of a racial constant" in the nineteenth century:
"Stendhal, Meredith, . . . Carlyle, J.A. Froude, Kingsley, Taine, Renan."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Trilling concludes that his "list could be made to include nearly every
writer of the time who generalized about human affairs" and this is
also the main conclusion of my own work (<i>MA,</i> 234-5).
<p>
It is particularly instructive to go back to Trilling as his measured
and controlled voice contrasts markedly with the sound of bombast
and moral self-righteousness which informs so much of the recent
debate as instigated by Anthony Julius and Tom Paulin on Eliot and
anti-Semitism. To be sure, in his book on Arnold, first published in
1939, Trilling goes to the heart of one of the key questions addressed
in  concerning Eliot and the treatment of Jews
in Nazi Germany:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If some used [a "racial hypothesis"] for liberalising purposes, as Arnold
himself did, still, by their very assent to an unfounded assumption,
they cannot wholly be dissociated from the . . . whole of official German
thought in the present day (<i>MA,</i> 235).
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Trilling argues that however liberalized Arnold's use of a racial
discourse, there remains an association between Arnold's racial
distinctions (between Semite and Aryan) and the institutionalization
of this racial rhetoric in Nazi Germany. It goes without saying that
no one in 1939 knew that such liberalized race-thinking would lead
to the death camps. But it is essential, I believe, to move away
from a teleological view of European anti-Semitism (culminating in
the Holocaust) which immediately transforms it into an aberrant or
pathological phenomenon. As Hannah Arendt has argued, once we think
of Jewish literary representations as fixed "stereotypes," "myths," or
"images," that have remained essentially the same across the centuries,
they become merely "natural consequences of an eternal problem."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
By decontextualizing modern anti-Semitism, the only context that is
allowed&#8212;that implicitly addresses anti-Semitism as an "eternal
problem"&#8212;is that of Nazi Germany. And yet, Trilling's sense that he
had been working on a re whom he could not wholly dissociate from
"official German thought" (<i>MA,</i> 235) clearly haunted him. In
an exchange of letters in 1943-4, Trilling challenged Eliot's notion
that Kipling was "not particularly anti-Semitic" with the following
devastating retort:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As anti-Semitism goes these days, I suppose Kipling is not&#8212;to use
Mr. Eliot's phrase&#8212;particularly anti-Semitic. I certainly should
not think of isolating for discussion what anti-Semitism he has, but
only of mentioning, as one aspect of a complex xenophobia, his queasy,
resentful feelings about Jews.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This exchange is instructive when read next to the most recent studies of
Jews in English literature published in the past decade. One approach,
which is closest to my own work, views the re of "the Jew" through
the lens of certain dominant discourses&#8212;whether they be empire,
nation, religion or race&#8212;and therefore perceives the representation
of Jews, in Trilling's terms, as a microcosm of broader concerns.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Other critics working in this field tend to focus on a conventional
historiography of anti-Semitism and stress mainly hostile negative
images and violent acts against Jews.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
These studies reinforce Arendt's "eternal" images of Jews and focus
primarily on a free-floating discourse (outside of time and space) which
is, by definition, decontextualized. Anti-Semitism, in these terms,
can only be understood as something that is essentially illiberal and
un-British (or un-American) which automatically locates it outside of
a liberal cultural context (be it late-nineteenth-century Boston or
early-twentieth-century London).
<p>
The debate between Ronald Schuchard and Anthony Julius is limited,
therefore, by its use of this conventional historiography of
anti-Semitism. In fact, Schuchard's insistence on Eliot as an ill-defined
"philo-Semite," and Julius's insistence on Eliot as an ill-defined
"anti-Semite," are mirror images of each other. Both think of Eliot
as either exceptionally benign or appallingly hostile (reinforcing his
foundational status in the Anglo-American canon). Both also think of him
as peculiarly unambivalent: with a straightforward and undifferentiated
affinity or hostility towards Jews. In these terms, both are also
dismissive of previous accounts of "Eliot and anti-Semitism" whether
it be by "Jewish critics" (an acceptable racial category, it seems)
that disagree with Julius or, in the case of Schuchard, any critic that
dare suggest that Eliot uses the language of "race" (as if this language
cannot also be used for "philo-Semitic" purposes).
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Once locked into the "discourse" (pace Julius) of either "anti-Semitism"
or "philo-Semitism" there is a predictability in both of their approaches
as the only "adversarial" reading that is allowed is a reading that
reinforces Eliot's supposedly self-evident predispositions.
<p>
For this reason, I prefer "semitic discourse"&#8212;as opposed to
"anti-Semitism" or "philo-Semitism"&#8212;because this phrase has the
advantage of eschewing the inherent moralizing in deciding who is, or is
not, "anti-" or "philo-." Instead of employing a predetermined "anti-"
or "philo-" perspective that explains any given reading, ironically
the one consistent feature of literary representations of "the Jew"
as a cultural signifier is its protean instability or ambivalence. The
work of Zygmunt Bauman is especially important in this regard as he
has rightly replaced "anti-Semitism" and/or "philo-Semitism" with what
he calls "allosemitism" which utilizes the Greek word for otherness,
<i>allus,</i> when referring to the practice of representing "the Jews"
as a radically different "Other."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
What the use of "allosemitism" or "semitic discourse" recognizes is
that the terms "anti-Semitism" and "philo-Semitism" are two relatively
distinct

<b></b>

aspects of a much broader history of differentiating Jews from other human
beings. The danger is that the conventional historiography continues to
essentialize Jews as uniquely timeless, unchanging victims and therefore
positions the history of anti-Semitism outside of the social, political,
and cultural processes which gave rise to this history in the first place.
<p>
The great advantage of liberating oneself from a conventional
vocabulary&#8212;which tends to be focused around moralized biographical
readings&#8212;is that it enables the literary critic to conduct a
genuinely open dialogue about the complex nature of racial discourse
within literary texts which neither excuses nor accuses the writers under
discussion. In the case of Eliot, it opens up a way of thinking about his
use of racial discourse which accepts that, like Joyce, he constructed
the Jew as a re of confusion; a perfect objective correlative for a
modernist skepticism. But, unlike Joyce, who embraced this confusion in
the re of the "greekjewish" Leopold Bloom, Eliot wished to impose
distinct boundaries between Hebrew and Hellene, Aryan and Semite, which
is most apparent in his social thought and less apparent in his poetry.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
To be sure, Eliot moved further away from Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> in his
increasingly doctrinaire essays. Two years after his influential review
of <i>Ulysses</i> in the <i>Dial,</i> Eliot was to return to Joyce's
ordering "mythic method" in a 1923 <i>Criterion</i> commentary on
"The Importance of Greek":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he study of Greek is the exact study of an exact language, a language
of refinement and precision . . . the study of Greek is part of the
study of our own mind: Our categories of thought are largely the outcome
of Greek thought; our categories of emotion are largely the outcome of
Greek literature. One of the advantages of the study of a more alien
language, such as one of the more highly developed oriental languages,
is to throw this fact into bold relief: a mind saturated with the
traditions of Indian philosophy is and must always remain very different
from one saturated with the traditions of European philosophy&#8212;as
is <i>every</i> European mind, even when untrained and unread. What
analytic psychology attempts to do for the individual mind, the study
of history&#8212;including language and literature&#8212;does for the
collective mind. Neglect of Greek means for Europe <i>a relapse into
unconsciousness.</i>
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The rigid associations, in this editorial, between Greek literature and
thought as the "language of [emotional] refinement and precision," on the
one hand, and the inexact non-European "alien languages," on the other,
are characteristic of Eliot's social thought in the <i>Criterion.</i>
Such generalizations, however, also hark back to the rather loose
references to the "mind of Europe" in "Tradition and the Individual
Talent" . In this restatement of his earlier essay, Eliot fears
that the collective "European mind" might potentially be superseded by
"alien" traditions. By neglecting Greek&#8212;which defines "our own
mind"&#8212;the exactness of "our categories of thought . . . and emotion"
are fatally undermined and threatened with "a relapse into [oriental]
unconsciousness." Such oppositions, which endanger the fragility of the
"mind of Europe," result in what Maud Ellmann has called a "contagion
of antitheses" in the work of Eliot.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Unlike Joyce's artful deconstruction of a racial discourse in
<i>Ulysses,</i> Eliot's excluded oriental "alien languages" constantly
return, in unexpected ways, to haunt his poetry.

<b></b>

In striving for "classical" exactitude and canonical authority,
Eliot relied upon a Semitic double&#8212;which could not, quite, be
repressed&#8212;to represent the opposite of his "Greek" ideals.
<p>
What is missing from the current debate is (to use Trilling's words) the
"queasy, resentful" identification which Eliot had with regard to Jews
in both his poetry and social thought. Julius's dismissal of Eliot's
Unitarian background&#8212;which Eliot clearly thought of as a form of
Arnoldian Hebraism&#8212;is telling in this regard.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
As late as his "American Literature and Language" , Eliot described
the household of his childhood as if he had, himself, been one of the
biblical Children of Israel:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The standard of conduct was that which my grandfather had set; our moral
judgments, our decisions between duty and self-indulgence, were taken as
if, like Moses, he had brought down the tables of the Law, any deviation
from which would be sinful. Not the least of these laws, which included
injunctions still more than prohibitions, was the law of Public Service:
it is no doubt owing to the impress of this law upon my infant mind that. . . I have felt . . . an uncomfortable and very inconvenient obligation
to serve upon committees.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's bathos can be compared with Arnold's famously grandiose
self-fashioning at the end of "The Function of Criticism at the Present
Time"  where he thinks of the modern critic as a Moses-re who
has a Pisgah-sight of the "promised land" of culture; an image which
Joyce in <i>Ulysses</i> was to cheerfully debunk. That Eliot encountered
a very real hostility in attempting to promote the modernist avant-garde
could only reinforce these forms of Jewish self-identification. Here we
have, for instance, an extraordinary letter by C. S. Lewis to Eliot's
friend, Paul Elmore More, written in 1935, which rewrites Eliot as part
of a group of cosmopolitan aliens who threaten to cause the downfall of
Western Europe:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Assuredly [Eliot] is one of the enemy: and all the more dangerous
because he is sometimes disguised as a friend. And this offence is
exaggerated by attendant circumstances, such as his arrogance. And (you
will further forgive me) it is further aggravated for an Englishman by
the recollection that Eliot stole upon us, a foreigner and a neutral,
while we were at war&#8212;obtained, I have my wonders how, a job in the
Bank of England [<i>sic</i>]&#8212;and became (am I wrong) the advance
guard of the invasion since carried out by his natural friends and allies,
the Steins and Pounds and <i>hoc genus omne,</i> the Parisian riff-raff
of denationalised Irishmen and Americans who have perhaps given Western
Europe her death wound.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Eliot, like "the Jew," is a "disguised" enemy who wheedles his way
into key financial institutions and, with a few alien co-conspirators,
helps to bring about the collapse of European civilization. But this
is a story of endless projection and displacement. Lewis, himself a
"denationalised Irishman" (as Ricks points out), projects his own sense of
foreignness onto the son of a Hebraised Unitarian liberal (T. S. Eliot)
who in turn projects his own sense of alien cosmopolitanism onto what
he calls "free-thinking Jews" and even the Judaised Matthew Arnold whom
he could never forgive (in essay after

<b></b>

essay) for replacing Christianity with culture. In "Mr. Eliot's Sunday
Morning Service," an under-represented "quatrain" poem in these terms,
the Hebraised "master of the subtle school" proliferates meaningless
words (or laws) and, thus, helps to perpetuate an all-encompassing
spiritual malaise. As Schuchard notes, Eliot's fear of contributing to
the social degeneration which so appalled him helped shape his definition
of Classicism, in a 1916 lecture, as "essentially a belief in Original
Sin&#8212;the necessity for austere discipline."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Eliot's disciplined search for a fixed sense of tradition and a
transcendent "order" took many forms&#8212;a fastidious Englishness; a
devout Anglo-Catholicism; and a keen political authoritarianism&#8212;all
of which were constructed to oppose his own dark Semitic double.
<p>
Once we stop shaping our responses to literature in terms of either
"anti-Semitism" or "philo-Semitism," it is possible to recognize those
moments in literary texts when "anti-Semitism" and "philo-Semitism"
become indistinguishable and there is instead an interplay between these
supposed irreconcilable states. In "The Approach to James Joyce," one
of many radio broadcasts that Eliot was to give during World War II,
he argued that the structure of <i>Ulysses</i> is realized by Joyce
"introducing himself&#8212;the same Stephen Daedalus who is the hero
of the <i>Portrait</i>&#8212;and he creates Bloom as a counterpart,
an opposite to himself."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Bloom is conceived rather conservatively by Eliot as Joyce's "opposite"
or "counterpart" who throws the self into relief. Eliot spent most of
his life trying to maintain the distinction between "self" and "other,"
Gentile or Jew, which Joyce was to joyously subvert.
<p>
Rather than seeing Horace Kallen as Eliot's liberal Jewish opposite,
as Schuchard argues, the Kallen-Eliot correspondence might be most
significant in relation to their points of agreement especially
with regard to the question of race and culture. After all, Kallen
published a series of articles in the <i>Nation</i> in 1915 where he
opposed the vision of an ethnic "melting pot" (soon to be popularized
by Israel Zangwill) as this would negate the "group-consciousness" of
American-Jews and other ethnic groups in the United States. Zangwill's
ideal of the "melting pot" can be thought of as a radical continuation of
the Arnoldian ideal of culture as it is designed to supersede differences
of all kinds. But Kallen vigorously opposed Zangwill and instead argued
that after attempting to assimilate, immigrants to the United States
would inevitably discover their "permanent group distinctions" and would
be finally "thrown back upon . . . [their] ancestry." As he was to state
notoriously (and later repudiate): "Men may change their clothes, their
politics, their wives, their religions, their philosophies, to a greater
or less extent; they cannot change their grandfathers."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
As with Eliot, and a great many other Christian and Jewish thinkers before
World War II, Kallen believed that race, not culture, determines ethnic
identity. While such logic was eventually anathema to Kallen, as it is to
ourselves, it is clear why Eliot would have been attracted to his Jewish
counterpart who managed to be both progressive (as a cultural pluralist)
and reactionary (as a racial determinist) at one and the same time. Rather
than praising or condemning supposedly benign or abhorrent individuals,
what is needed is a much greater understanding of the cultural context in
which particular writers and thinkers produced their texts and utilized
racial discourse. It is symptomatic

<b></b>

in this regard that Julius's account eschews any archival research
and also failed to acknowledge many of the studies of "Eliot and
anti-Semitism" that preceded him. In this regard, Maud Ellmann is
absolutely right to argue that: "Without . . . attention to textual
and biographical detail, the critic, in exposing anti-Semitism, always
runs the risk of witch-hunting, of re-enacting the paranoia of the
anti-Semite towards the Jew."
